It resembles, reasonably closely, to Diablo 2. It offers a classic hack'n'slash experience, levelling, item hunt and character progression. In addition to this, rather uncommon to the genre, story is excellent, and game could even be played as an adventure. Ridiculously funny and witty, game follows a number of cliches - protagonist is a Monster Hunter, which (ever accompanied by his sharp-witted and even sharper-tongued ghost companion Katarina), comes to a fictional land of Borgovia, to rid it of a great evil - a group of scientist who took over the land after his father defeated ruling Vampire Princes. But the story just starts to unroll...\n\nNotes:\nThe game was, and still is, sold in three different installment (and combination thereof) - The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing 1, 2 and 3. If you have *all* three games, in any combination (bought on Steam, than you own the game already - similar being true for GoG - or combination of both, this was said by developers, but I cannot confirm it). If you have a part(s) missing, you can buy them for normal price, the game will work - no need to buy what you have already...\n\nThe long description:\nA long time ago, a group of (somewhat) young, but lavishly talented, programmers (we didn't have 'devs' then) made Diablo 1, which basically redefined the aRPG genre. Few years later, Diablo 2 was made, and it remained the best aRPG ever made (with its expansion LoD).\n\nMany years later, a group of /skips the comments/ young and /skips the comments/ tried to redefine the genre, with much waited, but largerly disappointing /skips the game name/, which lacked way too much of the content, charm, and shall we say 'magic' of the genre foundation (D2).\n\nAbout the same time, another group of (mostly) young programmers and artists from the Hungarian-based independent studio NeoCore made Van Helsing 1, the game which resembled much most closely, but wasn't a carbon-copy of already named 'father of the genre'. The game grew. New classes were added. The sequels followed each year. Some were slightly disappoining (VH3) - but it shouldn't influence buyers decision. Now, some 5 month after VH3 - we get Van Helsing - Final Cut, which is a fusion of all three games.\n\nBut it's not all - the initial game is improved in many, many ways, graphics are better (they were already on the par with that unnamed AAA+ title), interface - which was in true 'father D2' style and good enough already is improved further, and initial flaws of previous titles are corrected.\n\nThere is an online component (though the game can be played in offline mode, a feature that doesn't mean so much nowadays, but still) - namely Multiplayer and Scenarios, which represent endgame. The team announced that each day there will be a special, daily, scenario (one can accumulate 5 of those, so no need to wait fanatically each day) and special weekend events until the end of the year, and if there is interest - throughout whole 2016. Since release day was delayed for more than a month, I suspect that guaranteed daily events time will be prolonged...\n\nSome data:\n- There are six classes, losely divided in melee, ranged and magic users (and combinations)\n- There are eight starting skills, each of which can be levelled to level 10, with possiblity to add powerups and special 'upgrades'\n- At character level 20, each of starting skills unlocks Tier 2 skill (which isn't necessarily, just upgraded version of previous, often it is a completely different skill, and mostly is just loosely grouped with the rest). Level 40 unlock last tier of skills, and final skill in 'tree' can be modified to a substantial degree to suit players preferences\n- Replayability is VERY high - each character can be played in several ways and playstyles, and there are 6 of with 24 skills each...\n- Not to forget, a passive skills (Auras) are pressent too, and are not the same for each character (though some do overlap)\n- Each character has an unique addition - for instance, one of them has a 'weapon platform', a flying contraption that follows player around and can be modified and improved in several ways, another is a master of stealth...\n\n- Story is funny and witty and writting surpasses by far what player normally expects from a computer game. I've heard that head writter is a publisher author, and it shows well\n- Gameplay is linear and quests are rather typical for the genre (bring *that*, kill *it*, free *her*), but clever writing parodies and ridicules these cliches, which I find appealing\n- UI is excellent - casual player can play with a hand on the mouse and a hamburger in the other, while a micro-fanatic can use keyboard shortcuts in a way which surpassed D2 (there - I said it. Configurability of the UI is better). Controller is also supported, but I hate those things and can't say anything about how well it works, only that I've *heard* it's fine\n\n- Voice acting is nothing short of SPECTACULAR (especially compared to some other games, who relies not on striking voices of actors, but rather on effects, which is not remotely closely) - this is a *very* important feature to me\n\n[This is one of the few games where I listen to the dialogues I've heard tens of times already - listen to the Prisoner7 striking voice and excellent... wording, and compare it to a certain overweight demon found with heavily processed voice and a childish master-plan... I'll put a youtube link with Prisoner7 - this link caused problem in posting the review. I put it in a comment below. - Rest of the character are also voiced in similar quality, but this one is my favourite]\n\n- Graphics are worthy of an AAA title, and team showed unique creativity in making unique mixture of Slavic-mythology and Steampunk\n- Enemies and terrain are designed masterfully, fully comparable to, for instance, Bethsheda games (and surpassing currently available aRPGs by a large margin - yet one additional feature player doesn't expect when buying hack'n'slash'). See some beautiful footage, the link I posted previously shows in in general, though the game itself isn't normally so much interrupted by a cut-scenes - which are good, but don't get the wrong impression that the game will be interrupted every 20 seconds)\n\n- Companion, Lady Katarina is an immortal ghost, which adds much to the gameplay diversity - she has her own skills and attributes, can do tiresome tasks like selling items, or helping out player as melee, ranged and special 'ghost form' (where she cannot attack or be attacked, but boosts player attributes)\n\n- Kataring has a rather sharp tongue and is cynical both to Van Helsing and the events in the game. She also has deep background story, which is unfolded during the game\n\nA note!\nI was a beta tester for all three games, this one included. I have invested many hours in this game(s) and regret none of it. I also helped game financially, by buying it as the gift for friends who like and play aRPG. I am happy that I did, because small independant studios couldn't otherwise afford to develop a game for years, as the major studios do. The result is here, and it's questionable if it would be anything, if there wasn't players who supported it. ALWAYS support what you like, or you won't get it...\n\nWait, wait, wait...\nNormally, I'd compare the game price with a cost of pizza here. Because we are dealing with mighty several family-sized pizzas here, I'll skip this... But if you have any of previous games, the (fair) NeoCore policy is to charge you just for the part you don't have already.\n\nSomething else?\nSuccess of Van Helsing allowed NeoCore to start working on WH40k aRPG title!","November 6, 2015","true","541.7"," 415 of 460 people (90%) found this review helpful 34 people found this review funny","90","415","460","34","38"

The character classes are those from the third part of the trilogy, and namely Protector, Bounty Hunter, Elementalist, Umbralist, Phlogistoneer and Constructor;\n\n2. The character attributes are now only 3 and are different for every class, and every attribute is important;\n\n3. The skills are combination from the skills in the trilogy games and are now organized in tiers and branches:\n\n3.1. There are 3 skill-tiers - the first one is accessible from the character creation, the second and the third are accessible at levels 20 and respectively 40;\n\n3.2. The branches are 3 linked skills from each of the tiers, to learn skill from tier 2, you should have learned it's linked skill from tier 1, respectively to learn skill from tier 3, you should have learned it's linked skill from tier 2, and in addition there are synergy-bonuses between the linked skills from given branch, given skill from tier 2 receives synergy from it's linked skill from tier 1, respectively given skill from tier 3 receives synergy from it's linked skills from tier 2 and tier 1;\n\n4. The character progression is now smoother and there is no inflation according to attributes and gear-bonuses;\n\n5. There are now 2 major modes - offline and online:\n\n5.1. In online mode your characters and shared chest is stored on Neocore-cloud and your characters get downloaded for every gaming-session, it requires internet-connectivity but DOESN'T require uninterrupted connection, in this major mode, in addition to the story and multiplayer, the players may experience the new end-game modes (Scenarios, Events and Daily Quests);\n\n5.2. In offline mode your characters and shared chest are stored on your machine, just like it was in the trilogy games, in this major mode you can play story and multiplayer with friends, and the end-game content.\n\nAt the end my opinion for the game is that it's really what most of us wanted, it's improved in every aspect. Neocore deserve deep admiration for bringing us the game in this brilliant state. They have it from me!\n\nI was one of the beta-testers of the game, and I am grateful to the devs that they gave me the chance to contribute somehow to this brilliant game!","November 6, 2015","true","231.7"," 234 of 287 people (82%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","82","234","287","12","11"

Several reminders to new players or someone who wants to play this game, you could treat this review as an incomplete guide. I'll update this review after each big patch as long as I'm still playing this game, you may want to keep an eye on this:\n1. There are bugs, not major ones, but don't expect this is a bug-free game already.\n2. Officially 50 hours game play in campaign mode, but actually for me, it's around 20 hrs (100% map exploration, monster respawn disabled, casual difficulty)\n3. You should expect your characters are weak before lv.40, at least for some classes.\n4. Put gold in your stash whenever possible, you'll need tons of golds in end-game (5m for a set piece, just give you a general idea), and you'll lose 10% of golds you CARRY IN YOUR BAG when you die.\n5. Use essences whenever possible, you can keep both the gear and essence when you take essence out.\n6. Unbalanced dmg between melee and ranged attacks for monsters, be careful. (fixed, see 1.0.4 EDIT2 below)\n7. Keep all the epics, when you combine them, you can get level-matched epics no matter how low-level epics you used (This is useful before lv.100, not useful at all when you hit lv.100)\n8. Arena gives you tons of EXPs, make sure you do it at least once a day\n9. Adventure mode strategy: Do whatever missions till you get 20-success buff (300% epic drop rate), then take advantege of this buff by killing every monster in each mission (not to lose this buff by choosing the difficulty you feel comfortable with). But don't feel too upset when you lose the buff, actually you almost can't feel the difference, 300% is a small number in this game\n10. You can buy keys using fate points near the trophy table, and also use five different kinds of essences to call Pegasus (Set vendor) near the trophy table\n11. Fate point daily limit is a PITA, so try to finish challenges ASAP (possible reset after patch), will give you lots of fate points, but try to save them when you hit lv.100 for gold chests (see 1.0.4 EDIT3 below)\n12. Buy cheap essences from vendors, because you'll need those for Chimera and Pegasus\n13. Try NOT to change affixes before lv.100 (but feel free to enchant), too expensive\n14. You can increase essence capacity by 20 at maximum, meaning that gears below 30 essence capacity are at disadvantage (godlike items can possibly have essence capacity beyond 50, wait to be tested)\n15. Perks level is maximized at 15, Katarina is maximized at lv.60\n16. You can only drop set and godlike items at lv.100 (from gold chest only, confirmed by devs)\n17. Multiple characters are encouraged, because you'll see some daily quests requiring particular class to finish\n18. So far in my opinion, proximity mine is the most difficulty affix to deal with, try to avoid by rerolling (costs 25 fate points)\n19. Forget gamble before lv.100, not worth it, forge your epics instead\n20. There are at least two types of monsters or skills you should be careful: one, the female mage's ice rain; two, the death circle of champions or elites with certain affix. Sorry for the confusion, but you'll recognize them. (may not apply to 1.0.4, haven't got a chance to test)\n21. The best mission in adventure mode: boss hunt, because you could possibly kill the same elite and champions three times at most\n22. Something about Chimera: before lv.7, choose the one with the most exps, after lv.7, choose lowest one (forget the name), FYI, you'll get her around Chapter 5, I believe\n23. Yellow and below quality items are completely useless unless you treat them as a gold source in end game\n24. As I mentioned before, epic drop rate doesn't help much, but you can see a significant difference when you choose a mission with three affixes\n25. You should expect the leveling speed slow down after lv.95 and of course also after lv.100\nAs a final note, the drop for godlike and set items has been fixed in 1.0.4 possibly, but I personally expect further change to that, also there's a mod in discussion tab that potentially would fix this issue outright, but I haven't had a chance to have a try\n26. In adventure mode, you can stack at most five daily missions.\nSolid game overall, but don't expect too much advancement from VH 1-2-3\n\n1.0.3 EDIT: Monster dmg is more balanced after 1.0.3, but you still should be careful about melee and ranged AOE.\n1.0.3 EDIT2: You possibly can't finish adventure mission with the objective that you can't die during the mission (happens to me), you may want to wait for another patch\n1.0.3 EDIT3: 30% reduced cost for enchanting, but still too high for me\n1.0.4 EDIT: According to devs, the game won't crash in Win10 anymore\n1.0.4 EDIT2: Monster dmg has been revamped, from my experience, in lower difficulties, you won't experience one-shot by monsters or unbalanced ranged and melee dmg anymore\n1.0.4 EDIT3: Fate points from challenges have been significantly reduced, you still could get some from finishing them, but don't focus on them anymore","November 12, 2015","true","60.7"," 100 of 117 people (85%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","85","100","117","8","12"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/400170/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Van Helsing has really been through the wringer. He’s spent three titles fighting off steampunk nightmares, demons, ghouls, and a slew of other supernatural cannon fodder. Now, he’s back for The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing: Final Cut, which combines the three previews game into one package with a slew of new features. It allows players to utilize all six character classes, including new ones that were introduced in the third outing, and play across all three games with one Helsing. Along with a myriad of other smaller improvements, it also adds an endgame with a new level cap of 100, introducing a glory system, rare items, daily events and a full multiplayer mode.\n\nThe trio of Helsing titles have always been great ARPG games, with a few flaws here and there that stop them from pushing the likes of Diablo III or Torchlight 2 from the top of the genre pile. Neocore Games’ decision to bundle the three games into one complete edition could be seen as another cash grab now that the trilogy has been concluded, but players who own the previous three efforts have received Final Cut free of charge. Neocore clearly want to reward their loyal fans.\n\nThe bundle turns the three separate games into a fifty hour long epic, with a story that carries across all three titles. The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing series has always had an intriguing plot, with the fun coming from the witty dialogue and banter between Van Helsing and his sidekick Lady Katarina. The third title gets much more personal, exploring the history of Katarina’s family, as well as looking into Helsing’s relationship with Borgovia and its chequered past.\n\nThe events at the end of the second game set up the third act for some satisfying personal development and some good old revenge that ties up neatly at the conclusion. The absurd sense of humour remains throughout and the combination of Helsing’s dry wit with Katarina’s sharp tongue and cynicism makes the pair an excellent odd couple that are a pleasure to listen to. It’s fun to see them grow across a consistent story, and playing as one character build throughout, rather than switching for each game, means that there’s a stronger sense of engagement with your duo of slayers.\n\nLooking at the changes made to the three games in this complete package, it’s clear to see that the Final Cut is better than the sum of its parts. The primary criticisms of the third game were the brevity of the running time, the over reliance on reused assets and monsters, and the game’s decreased level cap of just 30, down from 60. Final Cut seems directly aimed at addressing the complaints of the third title. The new level cap of 100 and the new post-game content combine to create a lengthy looting adventure with potentially endless replay value.\n\nPlaying the first two campaigns with the new classes and the co-op multiplayer mode is a strange experience. Neocore have really went all out here to make playing the entire Final Cut a fresh experience, even if you’ve already killed so many beasties as Helsing that the denizens of Borgovia tremble at your approach.\n\nThe two new classes carried over from the third game are nice and fresh, and work perfectly when retconned into the first two titles. The Bounty Hunter is all about long-range weapons, using mechanical seekers to track, mark and taunt enemies. The class can also use decoys to explore dangerous areas from a safe distance and lure out foes. The Constructor plays like a traditional ARPG’s summoner, as they fight at range. Using a vast gun platform, they can summon mechanical allies made from turrets, and use dismemberbots to do their bidding. They’re two fairly unique additions alongside the four existing classes, even if they do fall into existing genre clichés to an extent.\n\nSkill trees have been refined and polished as well, as have attributes. Each class now only has three attributes, entirely unique to them. Three skill tiers are available, with the first unlocking immediately, and the second and third tiers landing at level 20 and 40, respectively. The skills are a refined combination of those from across all three titles, meaning that even if you’ve played the first two games to death, you’ll still find yourself with entirely new builds and options, all rebalanced with plenty of potential for power growth.\n\nThe newly revamped graphics do the business, and the Slavic inspired beasties along with the steam-punk trappings of the title are a truly unique combo that are a pleasure to behold. The game handles a large amount of foes on screen at once very well for the most part, rarely dropping in frame rate, though it unfortunately isn’t particularly smooth to start with. It can be difficult to target one foe specifically to dish out some punishment, and the animation isn’t as detailed and punchy as I’d like. Often, it doesn’t feel like you’re actually killing the foes yourself, even with a melee class.\n\nThe new multiplayer features, meanwhile, are serviceable. Players can drop in and out of each other’s games, for up to 4 player co-op action. There are a few PvP modes but they’re nothing revolutionary, and it’s likely you’ll have little interest in touching them, as combat mostly boils down to numbers and watching cool downs. Players can vote when to change to a new location to go questing, with the game host’s quest goals becoming the goal for everyone.\n\nAs with most titles of the genre, you probably already know if you’ll like The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing: Final Cut. It’s very much aimed at those with a firm love of ARPG’s. It doesn’t reinvent the wheel, and while the new content is welcome, it makes little attempt to polish some of the flaws of the previous titles.\n\nIf you own the previous three titles, it’s worth grabbing your free copy just to enjoy the new content and the tweaks. In some ways, it’s an entirely new game and there are plenty of additions to keep seasoned slayers happy. If you’re entirely new to the series, this is an absolute steal at the asking price. It’s not nearly as polished as Diablo III, but if you’re looking to have that loot grinding itch scratched, you could do much worse. That being said, if you’ve dabbled in The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing before and it didn’t grab you, this version won’t convince you otherwise. The core gameplay is entirely the same, with flaws intact.","January 16","true","183.2"," 36 of 38 people (95%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","95","36","38","3","0"

It's similar in many aspects and if you really enjoy these type of games, you'll enjoy this one. It's got a pretty interesting story. Has some good parts, some funny, etc. The classes are pretty interesting. If you've played Diablo 2 or PoE, you'll see some similar themes. Such as when I was playing the engineer (you build these robotic spider things as pets), it reminded me a bit of the Druid summoner in D2. I like most of the classes and their design.\n\nThe game offers a follower system, just like D3/D2. You upgrade it, choose what skills it can get, which combat roles it fills, etc. Pretty standard, but a good aspect of the game.\n\nNow I wont say this is a PoE clone/Diablo clone. There a lot of ways it sets itself apart from it. But I also can't ignore that the games are similar.\n\nThe setting/theme is a steampunkish in teh Van Helsing universe (duh). I enjoyed it. It was a nice change of pace.\n\nThe developers are also pretty cool. They sent all the beta testers a copy of one of their other games for testing. In a world where pratically every company is selling access to testing with the "Early Access" none sense, it was really refreshing to see.\n\nFinally, one of the most important parts.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/recommended/400170/","maudish","Audish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/","908 products in account","I was not a fan of the first Van Helsing. It had all the right parts for a great ARPG, but suffered some serious balance and interface issues. I took a chance on Final Cut because I was so enamored with the setting, and I'm glad I did. And strangely enough, the game itself wasn't even the best part.\n\nUnsurprisingly you play as a Van Helsing, but as the son of the Van Helsing you're actually thinking of. He's followed in his father's footsteps as a gravelly-voiced monster hunter, accompanied by his snarky etherial companion Katarina. Together they travel to the ancient city of Borgova (or Borgovia, people call it both), once the stronghold of vampire kings overthrown by the elder Van Helsing, now a gothic metropolis suffering under the tyranny of mad science. Liberation, then, means killing thousands of monsters and stealing their incrementally-better pants.\n\nPlayers of Diablo or its competitors will feel right at home here. You have six classes to choose from, each with extensive trees of skills to sink points into. The first big twist on the formula here is the powerup system, a series of powerful bonuses you can unlock for each skill that are triggered by spending a third resource, Rage. The other is your ever-present partner, Katarina, who assists you in battle and has her own inventory and skill trees. These two factors help keep combat manageable even when being swarmed by dozens of foes. There's plenty of hacking and slashing to be had, but put up against other ARPGs it comes off a little light, missing some key sound cues and staggering effects that would punctuate visceral combat.\n\nYour journey through the mysterious land of Borgov(i)a is a striking and often picturesque one. Maps tend to have lots of impressive vistas and set pieces, along with plenty of detail in the common elements. Enemies are similarly detailed and enjoy some very unique designs. Fighting steam-powered fumigators in the rain-soaked streets of a gothic city is just as memorable as it sounds, though as mentioned before the sound design doesn't always keep up with the visual quality. There's not a lot of production to the cutscenes but they're saved by the campy back-and-forth between straight man Van Helsing and charming sociopath Katarina, and supported by some genuinely funny NPCs.\n\nSince Final Cut is the Van Helsing trilogy stitched into one game, it's helpful to break down the gameplay into three acts. The first is classic ARPG fare, with you fighting your way through forests and mountain passes, aiding small villages, and eventually reaching the big city and taking on its overlord. The maps are sprawling, and the bosses have interesting gimmicks. This falls off a bit in the second act, where the game sets up Van Helsing as the leader of a resistance army against a new threat. The maps for this plotline are arranged more like battlefields, with friendly units and commanders taking the place of sidequests. There's more of a sense of grandeur to this act, but the trade-off is a lot of backtracking and re-use of the same maps. The bosses also take a considerable nosedive in quality, becoming simple sacks of HP to whittle down. However, you do get two interesting side activities, a resistance management screen where you can train troops and send them on their own missions, and a pet chimera you can send to uncover loot for you. For the final act, the game returns to a grand journey motif as you hunt down your new nemesis. This journey takes you through a number of clever and colorful locales in the Ink, the primal foundations of reality, but at the cost of much of the sidequests and hidden content that made the first two acts so fun. It's a straight shot to the villain for a long, drawn-out, and not terribly interesting final battle. It's a bit of a disappointing capstone to the game, though not one that drags down the entire experience.\n\nThere are plenty of other details to keep you invested in the game, though. You'll encounter optional tower defense missions at different points which are a surprising amount of fun. Certain boss trophies can create global effects for both you and enemies, like reduced resistances or more damage. If you tire of story mode, there's an adventure mode with missions and challenges to face for ever-better loot and upgrades. However, if you're in it for the loot you may be disappointed. While there are tons of item types and crafting options, very few drops ever go beyond simple stat increases.\n\nAll of these points combine to form an ARPG that's solid, if not a real stand-out. What really made the difference for me, then, was the controller support. ARPGs don't often have very good controller support, but Van Helsing might just have the best. The entire interface changes when you have a controller plugged in, switching your menus to easily-navigable pages of radial menus and simplified lists. The button layouts for skills are inspired as well, controlling all of your attacks from the face and right buttons, with the left buttons handling interactions and the D-pad managing your map and potions. The attention to detail here makes a big difference, and elevates Van Helsing to one of the more enjoyable ARPGs I've hacked my way through.","March 16","true","35.6"," 18 of 23 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","18","23","0","2"

But multiplayer has technical problems.\n\n\nProving that Torchlight isn't the only game that can match Diablo at its own game, Van Helsing: Final Cut is a well made, atmospheric action RPG set in a Fantastical version of the Victorian Era. And it uses its setting wonderfully. Using the full breadth of its 'Magical Steampunk' setting, your enemies range from traditional vampires, kobold-like creatures and gargoyles, to steampunk machines like a walking steam locomotive with gatling guns and four-legged cannon spider automatons, to combinations of fantasy and technology (a huge slug-creature with four legs that also happens to be carrying a gigantic cannon).\n\nThe game's maps also take advantage of the setting well. You'll start with the traditional rural village, forest and caves, then transition to a smog-covered Victorian city with huge factories, secret laboratories and a beautiful wide-open marble and cobblestone palace quarter. Towards the end you'll spend more of your time in an alternate dimension called 'the Ink', which looks like various twisted versions of the real world. The aesthetic is very nice, leaning more towards realism (as opposed to Torchlight's cartoon-like aesthetic), but the designs of the environments themselves are interesting enough so that 'realism' does not equate to 'boring'.\n\nThe game has 6 classes that more or less fall into expected Action RPG types (melee tank, ranged DPS, melee DPS, magic DPS, and petmaster), with each class (mostly) having enough variation so you can try out different playstyles. It doesn't seem to have anything revolutionary when it comes to class mechanics, but none of it is badly done either.\n\nWhat carried me through the entire game were the two main characters, Van Helsing and his ghostly companion Katarina. The way their banter is written and delivered always made me smile or chuckle. Van Helsing as the no-nonsense jaded monster hunter and Katarina as the snarky cynical know-it-all hundreds-year-old ghost works really, really well and is my opinion the BEST use of the main characters in any Action RPG ever. In most other ARPGs the player character is just a non-speaking template you put experience and skills into, and the story is in the characters and situations around the generic player character. Not so in Van Helsing. You start to like the characters you are playing on their personalities and banter alone. We could use more of that in other ARPGs.\n\nThe game's big downside, though, is multiplayer. When it works, it works well, but when it fails (which is rather often), it fails BADLY. I've randomly crashed out of multiplayer many times, and sometimes you lose levels due to this. When it was released, the server lobby had this bug where the list of games is cleared a few seconds after it's refreshed, making it unusable (thankfully this has been fixed in patches). If you have a laggy connection, monsters that are dead could still appear alive in your client, leading you to shoot at empty space.\n\nFortunately single player has none of those problems. I didn't crash once playing through the entire storyline (around 20 hours) in single player.\n\nIf you like ARPGs and steampunk, its a no-brainer: buy this game. If you like to see a bit more 'character' in your main character and story in your ARPGs, buy this game. If you're into ARPGs because of mechanics and multiplayer, you may want to wait a while for the game to be patched, then buy this game on sale. In any case, this is a well made game, in an interesting magic steampunk setting, with great main characters and a decent story. It's worth a try.","November 14, 2015","true","46.4"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

I'm not sure if it even matters, but I cannot be of any use to 'veteran' players who are wondering if it's worth playing this version. Although, as I understood it, the game was free to people who already own the 3 seperate games? In that case it won't matter much.\n\nI remember liking Torchlight a lot and I read some reviews of this game before buying it (at 66% off it was a steal!) and it is indeed very similar to Torchlight, so if you enjoyed those games, this is surely something for you. It also has some similarities to Path of Exile, although it's not as grim and morbid (no Pieties piling up milions of corpses for example).\n\nThe story is very good. I must admit I didn't expect much of it, but they did a great job. The dialogue between Katarina and Van Helsing is amazing, very funny at times and it never gets old. What really made me laugh quite a few times are the many, many references to pop culture they wove into the game without making it feel forced. Lord of the Rings, the Hunger Games, Titanic (I kid you not, it made me laugh so hard when I heard the little music and saw them go through the "I'm the king of the world"-routine), and many many more references that most people, and in some cases maybe only the "nerds" will recognize. It doesn't affect the game at all, but they wove it into the story and the background without effort. I was very positively surprised by this.\n\nBy now I have only played the storyline once and did a few missions of the adventure map, and I doubt it will increase much in the near future because I have my eyes on another game which will probably take up my time. So my opinion is a little limited since I only played it on one character, an elementalist.\n\nHaving Katarina with you makes it easier, I doubt I would have survived certain things if it weren't for her tanking the monsters. The system is really nice since you can adjust her behavior to your character. For squishy characters you can make her a tank, but for others you could make her ranged, or stop her from attacking altogether and in return get some of her stats for yourself. She has 3 skilltrees, basically one for each 'behavioral mode' but you are perfectly welcome to mix and match what you want for her. One small con I found with Katarina is that her level is capped at 60, which for example makes it impossible to get her better items after that point. I mean, you can always make her better items, but anything you might find that is better than what she is currently using will be unavailable to her because of the level cap.\n\nI haven't gotten to the part where I have a high enough level to start getting my epics, creating new items, using my essences, etc, but I figured it would be pretty much the same as in Path of Exile where you save your items until you are not basically wasting them for the few levels in which you might use your items.\n\nAll in all, even if you don't plan on replaying it, maxing out your characters or even do the online/co-op thing, the story mode alone is worth getting it. Just wait until it's on sale and get it then. As you can see, I went 50 hours for one playthrough and a few extra adventure missions, so you would definitely get your money's worth. There is a lot of hidden content and after each chapter it will show you how many quests you have finished and the amount of hidden content you have actually discovered and in some of those chapters I missed almost half of it. So a replay is definitely warranted at some point.\n\nHighly recommended, it gave me a lot of fun playing.","March 29","true","52.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Diablo and Torchlight are great, but this is simply more fun, more complex and more interesting. Only a few hours on the "Final Cut," but I played 1-3 pretty extensively. This update is a great way to revisit the series with all the feature adds from the later games overlaid on the originals. If you haven't ever played, you're in for a huge treat. Six classes that play VERY differently. One of which is a total tank, if that's your think. Two flavors of "builder" classes if you like toys. Two flavors of ranged fighers (one of which is also a builder). The skill progressions are fun and provide even more customization options, including three powerups for each skill that can be individually buffed more, or all buffed just a bit at the same time. Plenty of quests, side-quests, random encounters, weird quests.\n\nWorks great either either mouse/keyboard or gamepad.\n\nYour companion is a witty ghost, the music is a treat and if you've got the rig, the high-def texture pack makes the whole thing look totally money. Fixed view (no zoom or rotate) which irritated me for exactly 45 seconds and then I forgot about it.\n\nSo much win in this game. I recommend at least "hard" if you've ever played any ARPGs, as easy and normal are cake-walks.","November 7, 2015","true","10.5"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","0"

Keep in mind this is 3 games in 1 and that its going to take you 20-30 hours to complete depending on how much side activities you do.\nThere was a point around halfway through the first game where i became so bored with the game. No other game i have ever played felt like a chore to complete as much as this game did.\nI played through this whole game with my friend and we were determined to beat it for no reason at all. If it wasn't for him i would have stopped after the first game. The story in all 3 games were boring and cliche, the characters were flat and uninteresting and the dialogue is cringeworthy at many points.\nThe game likes to make references to other games and that's the games humor as well as cringeworthy banter. The gameplay remains the same throughout the whole thing and does nothing to change up expect for getting a new ability in your skill tree every 5 hours.\nThere is no challenge in the game at all because there is no punishment for dying. You lose a bit of gold for dying but it doesn't matter at all because there is nothing worth buying in the game and you get so much gold from selling sh*t and treasure chests that you don't care at all. You also don't lose any money from dying during boss fights so when you die nothing happens you respawn and just continue the bossfight like nothing has happened.\nThe game tests your patience and nothing else because alot of the enemies and bosses have so much hp and take so long to take down like the final boss of van helsing 3.\nThe game is a dungeon crawler action rpg like diablo for example and unlike diablo the game did not get boring to me just after a few hours. Diablo 2 in particular i beat multiple times growing up and the game always felt fresh because of the loot and the gameplay always felt varied and different which this game fails at doing at that is its biggest flaw.\nI also want to point out that i got an achievement for beating the game in coop and according to steam less than 1% of players have this achievement. That really says something about this games 'fanbase' that defend the game.\nI can only recommend this game to hardcore dungeon crawler fans that can put up with the repetitive gameplay and killing the same generic enemies over 1000 times. From my experience however this game is mediocre at best.\n4/10 (Mediocre)","February 15","false","24.7"," 29 of 53 people (55%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","55","29","53","5","0"

(The Schmaltzy Cynic)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brian_Colfxire/","468 products in account","This is not a game for everyone, and I say this because I think casual players of aRPGs (like myself) won't find as many issues as the more hardcore veterans. There are numerous changes to the aRPG formula that will be a matter of taste.\n\nAfter 45 hours of the Story Mode, I think I can hopefully explain the game's merits and faults (for both casual and hardcore fans).\n\nKeep in mind that I haven't tried out the multiplayer. My first character was an online adventurer going solo, so I am not aware if there are any issues with the multiplayer. I haven't had any crashes since the update nor had my character wiped.\n\nWhy Is This the Definitive Edition?\nI had no idea that a definitive edition was ever coming out. Thankfully, the devs were nice enough to let anyone who purchases the trilogy of games--at any date--to get the Final Cut for free. (They're looking for a solution for people who own the games on GOG and Steam.)\n\nIf you're wondering what is different, there is far too much to mention here. If you wish to read an explanation behind the development of the three games, here is a link to an article to explain what happened:\n\nhttp://www.neocoregames.com/2015/06/the-incredible-development-of-van-helsing-iii/\n\nThe short story is the devs had never intended to release each game alone--they were to be episodic content. (Originally, the game had ONE class and no Katarina companion.) And because they completely revamped the later established three classes of VH 1 and 2, you couldn't transfer your save to VH3.\n\nMany fans were rightfully upset, and I think what the devs did by giving the FC for free is an apology to them. Now all three games have continuity to the end, a higher LV cap to boot, and all six (finalized) classes from the start.\n\nThat is my take on it--I don't claim this as fact nor do I speak for NeoCore. You can still purchase the previous games if the format they provided--a more traditional aRPG experience--is more to your taste.\n\nWhat Stands Out\nNo grinding for stats.\nALL enemies are scaled to your level, and the eleven difficulties change their percentages. (Some locked by level caps.)\n\nBuilding your character is key for the game.\nThe six classes have unique playstyles, even three unique attribute points to make it easier to distinguish the changes.\n\nSpecializing your skills via passives and Rage perks to make them better.\nBut don't forget about your Auras. These passive abilities can be mandatory--like how I learned when I played the Constructor--because they provide essential bonuses to your playstyle.\n\nYou can reset your skill and atrribute points for yourself (and Katarina, your ghostly companion) at any point in the game for a fee.\nYour companion can compliment your playstyle if you play alone.\n\nKatarina can play a melee, ranged or passive role with AI commands, and she also has a skill-tree and unique attribute system too.\n\nThe best thing about her role is that it's not cumbersome to juggle two characters at once, and she can even improve your character too with the right perks.\n\nGameplay changes to genre.\nTower Defense missions and failure-states/alternative choices to quests. (Kind of like the Witcher with morally gray choices.)\n\nMemorable boss-fights.\nMany have interesting gameplay challenges to not feel the same. For example, the General Harker fight has you battling two armies at once by weaking one side or teaming up with that side to even the odds.\n\nAll these changes feel great to play, and they make those 40+ hours of an adventure interesting. Except towards the end when the game begins to wane on with no new substance.\n\nWhat Remains Questionable\nEach class only one style to play. (Or it feels like it.) Each class has only one weapon type, and, to me, one build.\nExperimentation is neutered compared to other games with at least some variation.\n\nFor example, I don't think you can play the Constructor as anything but a technomancer. Too many skills and auras are based around summoning things.\n\nCompare this case, for example, to the Amazon class in Diablo 2. You could be an archer, a javelin and shield warrior, or something of your own choice. The skill tree accomidated all three, and it was all up to the player. The same goes for all the classes in that game.\n\nSpecialization is strongly emphaiszed compared to previous games.\nIn VH1 and VH2, the original three classes were distinct, but they had some variation. You could be a melee and ranged Hunter, and people seemed to love that amount of diversity. But VH3 thought that those classes were too limiting, so the three became six distinct classes to ensure every class played differently.\n\nYou remember those Baal Runs for grinding for loot? You won't be able to do that in this game. At least to my knowledge.\nSee, whenever you clear out an area, there is really nothing left to do. Except the quests you forgot to do. This is because the game wants to keep the scales in check.\n\nSo... There are no boss respawns. No grinding for rare loot. (Perhaps the coop mode will let you fight the boss again on someone else's save?). Instead, your means of finding extra loot is to feed this Chimera-dog thing and let it hunt for loot. I don't know if you get anything worthwhile as I never used it once, nor the gambling vendor.\n\nWeird story tone-shifts due to references. (Yes, there are memes.)\nThe story is something I like because these games tend to be less character driven. Van Helsing and Katrina do have character, regardless of what you choose.\n\nI wish the game's "humor" would tone itself down a little... You can't have three Monty Python references in one game and think you're serious. Nor when you make a Scooby Doo reference at the final boss-fight.\n\nHonestly, I imagine this game as a Tabletop Van Helsing game with Gruff McGruffyton, Wity Von Witterella and Dr. Claw all playing together. It makes for some funny off-screen ideas.\n\nNone of these, however, are the worst/lacking aspects of the game.\n\nWhat Is Lacking/Worse\nYou might think that, worse-case scenario, if you can't fight bosses again on the same run you can play NG+ mode... Right?\nNo. There is no NG+ mode. I hate this aspect because I wanted to play the game over with my first character to see how well he works at a higher difficulty. (Hard or Heroic is my recommendation for a challenge).\n\nAdventure Mode is... okay? But not an alternative.\nI haven't played this mode enough to like it. They're randomly generated missions with different win-conditions and rules, and they can possibly be fun, but I don't think they were meant to play solo. (Which the end-game stuff is now available for offline characters--yes, just like Diablo 2 and 3).\n\nBut my problem is that it shouldn't be a substitute for NG+ mode.\n\nThe Final Act... Remains the worst.\nThe problem is that the one new feature of VH3 is now at the start of the game. The six classes. Other than that addition, there is no new gameplay gimmicks, no new mission structures or anything wortwhile for the "epic" conclusion. Not even the Assassin's Creed-like resistance gimmick has any real pay off.\n\nWorse, the bosses are much less interesting compared to any boss in VH 1 and 2. Only the final boss has anything different, but the slog of levels padded before the final fight does not make that fight any more worthwhile.\n\nNot All Change is Good, Nor Exchangable\nThe FC is what the game was always meant to be, and I love it for what it offers. But holding on to bad conventions--the padding to the final boss--while removing the good ideas of old is not what should be innovated.","November 13, 2015","true","48.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","3"

After playing I purchased the franchise. At that time I was unaware of VH: Final Cut. I had just completed VH1 and was set to start VH2 when the Final Cut was released.\n\nThe final cut is worth playing, the leveling changed enough to make me feel like i was not playing the same game again. I also noticed quest changes and additions, which made it still feel fresh and fun. They took away 2 classes from VH1 and added 5 more.\nI am sure there are more in-depth reviews you can find with all the changes/additions and so-on, however if you enjoy monsters and guns with a side of steam-punk...well this is the game for you.\n\nOn a side note:\nThe original VH franchise is worth getting if you can grab it on a sale like they had for Halloween (VH1,2,3 and Deathtrap for $25). Playing through VH1, i already knew I wanted to give it a 2nd play through and VH: Final Cut is the best possible 2nd play through.

All the game mechanics are meshed together to make it feel like one long game, all 6 classes are present now with an overwhelmingly large skill tree. The skills and character abilities have been meshed to replicate the first game with the trees requiring to reach approximate levels like 20 for 2's skills and 40 for 3's skills. Its a classic arpg with tons of easter eggs and content to explore. And I would also recommend this game not only for being a great game but it comes from a dev team that actually cares about their games. There are bugs yes but nothing in my playtime that has made it gamebreaking, but I have never seen so many dev responses to issues like this just on the steam forums alone, and if you already own the previous installments Neocore was even nice enough to hand out copies of this for free (instead of just re-releasing it for more money unlike many others). I really couldn't recommend it more, the awesome mythical, steampunky world of Van Helsing is a fun concept alone mixed on top of a repetitively fun rpg. 9/10","February 19","true","26.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

But you can change the game difficulty at anytime during the game from "Casual" to "Inhuman ordeal 5". Difficulty increases monster health and damage aswell as increasing xp, gold and epic droprate.\n\nSo after finishing the game i'm left wanting more but unfortunately the game doesn't have much more to offer.\nYou can either farm gold or do daily quests in Adventure mode to obtain better gear.\n\nBut even so, the story outweighs the negative areas of the game and offer more than 30hours of gameplay. 60-70 hours in my case but i like to explore and find hidden content which there is plenty to be found.\n\nIf it's on sale and you're looking for a good arpg this is worth considering.","December 31, 2015","true","179.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I am very disappointed with the outcome. Also, I still don't understand why the game is so big, it clocks in at around 30 gigs or so, more if download the official texture pack.\n\nThings that are great:\n-fun story, katarina is a great character\n-pleasing art direction and gameworld\n\nThings that are not so great:\n-classes: there is not much variance in builds within a class, some classes do not live up to their descriptions.\n-gear: nonsensical stats on class specific items, not much interesting loot\n-scaling difficulty: there are some builds and skills that simply won't function beyond casual mode, and if you fall behind on your gear then it becomes a painful slog, even on casual. No balance\n-spikes in damage: be prepared to be one shot by many ranged enemy packs, regardless of class/build/gear\n-poor descriptions: of stats and skills and how they relate to each other. Stats on gear that intuitively make sense are actually non functioning, and interact in arbitrary ways with skills. If you want to plan an optimized build you have to go look at the code in the config files.\n-gamepad works awesome, but some skills do not function properly and can't be aimed, oversights it would seem\n\n\nIf you want a casual playthrough, stay away from this incarnation of the van helsing series and pick up the individual games - casual difficulty here is far from faceroll territory. If you liked the classes in the first two games, stay away because they are largely gone. If you want to grab this and get a polished experience without hassle, stay away.\n\nBright spot: there are some saintly modders who are trying to bring this beast into passable shape. Its pretty easy to use, its detailed on steam guides, and is simple. But if you don't want to deal with hassle, stay away.

The full story arc makes complete sense and having the specializations available from the beginning makes each play through unique.\nThe redone skill trees and the new UI design are well thought out.\nThe voice acting was always one of the high points of the series and this version does not disappoint.\nI recommend this game to people who liked Dungeon Siege III.\n\nThere are specializations for every playstyle. Like pet classes? Play the Constructor. Like tanking melee classes? Protector. Sneaky hit and run melee? Umbralist. Ranged spiker? Elementalist. Ranged DPS? Bounty Hunter.  Crowd control? Phlogistineer. Every specialization plays differently and they are all "good."\nMy only sadness is that they removed all of the movement skills. Every skill is basically an attack of some kind.\n\nWith that said, there are some issues, not with the game itself, but with information about the game.\nThere is no comprehensive manual, wiki, or corporate site that explains how the game works, what the specializations are, what skills are, what auras are, how you use essences, how you forge new items, how to manage your army and your captains, etc. You have to figure it all out in-game. There are pop-up hints that help a bit, but no true tutorial.\nIt's actually the main reason I held off on buying the game for so long. I waited until it was on a really good sale to buy it becuase I knew next to nothing about how it played or what it kept or discarded from the previous games.\n\nI still love this game.

This is NOT the same title I stressed over a few years ago.  No way.  They completely cleaned this up.  Everything about it really shines, but I think the biggest improvement has got to be how balanced it is now.  I know I can be a completely NOOB in certain games, but there's no reason why at Level 5 you should be getting a mudhole stomped dry in your ♥♥♥ by mobs.  Not that early in the game, and certainly not on lower difficulty levels.  That and the constant crashing and save file corrupting forced me to legit stop playing the first one, and I LOVE Isometric action RPGs.  Everything I read about the second and third titles made me steer clear of them, but Neocore really did listen to the fans of this series and release a truly incredible game.

You had to use your “little neuron” to get all the secrets and to finish the game. A very nice game and it was promising ( there will be 3 games ).\nAnd 2014 had come and a new Van Helsing has been released and other many hours of game play fun and secrets to find  ( Still waiting for the last game ) But let’s not forget the bugs :P\n2015 and Van Helsing 3 was here and the last part of the story to. Again after I got my hands on the game I had “eat it” and finish it. The final part of Katerina’s story was the best!!!\nAfter the release we had ( all the games ) the official news that there will be a Final Cut in autumn!\nI had the chance to be a beta tester and it was GREAT! ( still reporting bugs :P but the developers fix them faster then I can find them  )  and now I am working on the Final Cut version of the game.\nVery nice improvement with the daily quests ( it makes you to have all 6 characters at level 100 ).\nThe additional difficulty levels are very nice\nThis is the first time when I see 3 games ( released in 3 different years ) in a single game.\n\nKeep on the good work!\nP.S. waiting for more improvements!!!\nP.S.S. thanks NeocoreGames for the gift, today i was Santa for a friend!","December 2, 2015","true","82.8"," 11 of 21 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","11","21","0","3"

Online and offline characters are seperated they can be one or the other and which mode you create them in is locked. To play at any point in the future online with a character or have end of game content you MUST create the character online.\n\nThe problem is when playing online the game is fundimentally unstable and crashes. In my case 4 times in less than an hour. This contrasts with the offline mode which plays without any hitches for almost 4 hours.\n\nI'm forced to choose between being able to actually play the game without constant crashing or have to fight for every minute I try and play online single player for it to not crash.\n\nIf they had allowed you to develop your single player character online and offline then I'd give it a thumbs up and say be patient while they fix their broken online mode.\n\nAs I can't develop my character offline and wait till they fix their online mode it is thumbs down.","November 9, 2015","false","7.1"," 13 of 27 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","13","27","0","3"

I find myself in the same position as TB did when he reviewed the "Deserts of Kharak": I sincirely want to recommend it and I feel as if it deserves it, but there is this element that bugs out the whole game.\n\nGAME DESIGN IS WRONG.\n\nWhile reaching high levels, if you have any ARPG experience at all, it'll be pretty easy(even on supposedly "difficult" setting of Fearless). Then right out of a blue, you start getting owned. Which leads to several ♥♥♥♥♥♥ situations:\n\n-> Lower the difficulty(which leads to you falling asleep because now you oneshot everything without any danger at all)\n-> Raise the difficulty(you are still pretty much owning everything around you, provided you don't get hit. But now it's too precarious to play anything but niche builds)\n-> Grind while playing the story(ok, this is wrong)\n\nThis situation also leads to scenarios where every character has like 2(if you play at Fearless or higher even less >.>) builds and after 50, the game is simply crazy.\n\nThe story is funny, the gfx is nice and the game is FUN to play! But what's it worth when the very beating heart of a game is sick?\n\nUnfortunately, this is a NO.","January 25","false","98.4"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","8","17","0","0"

Nearly impossible to get friends in same game, some don't see the game then we try new host and all tricks google gave us and yet the situation is the same than similar posts about the problems in 2013. What the ♥♥♥♥? Connecting and resolving for over 2 years. Right. Then there is the crashing and when you crash, you can't join the adventure quest where you friends are, that is if you managed to find the hosted game in the first place. I had graphic bugs but I guess newest nvidia drivers aren't that good and that was irrelevant, most of the time the game crashed while loading to a quest.\n\nAnyway there are some other things anyone should know. Umbralist teleport can't go past any objects, apart from monsters. That's right. The TP can't go over small stones, trees or standing trees but can go over big monsters (which look cool though). The teleport needs to have clear line of sight and can only go where you can run. No teleporting up the cliff near stairs.\n\nClick targeting sucks. Monsters have highest priority over picking up items and reviving allies, unit collision is really annoying too.\n\nBugs and silly "features" like these are unacceptable. There has been so many arpg games to show things like these and this game looks so polished and feels okey so why things like what I listed exist? Non-fuctioning multiplayer killed this game for me, luckily it was -66% otherwise I would be upset.\n\nIf you enjoy playing alone, this is fine. If you seek for nice arpg/dungen crawler, look elsewhere. For me there are other similar games I'm interested in - if this doesn't work, I'm not speding time on this.

Game itself i beautifull, very nice mechanichs, you dont actually get bored in quests, really playeble. I have lvl 100 contructor, and i enjoyed every second of it. Till lvl 100.\n\nMaybe i missed smthing, but when i have finshed game, there was literaly nothing in solo story line. I was just standing there, and nothing to do. So , i went adventrue. Thats the place i got bored. I cant play multyplayer, coz my char is invalid. There is no explanation why. Game itself ask you to reset ability/skill points, you press yes, nothing happens. No matter what u do, your char is invalid and u cant actually play  multyplayer. There are a lot of crushes, and devs simply dont  fix anything . WHich is strange, coz game has potention to be incredibly good. Adventure mod is  boring. Maybe first few times it is ok, but, the game is ment to be  item chasing/grinding, which in this game is NOT THE  case. Most of items u get are acctually very very bad. It is , at least, stupid, to use itms lvl 60  when u r lvl 100+   just becouse all items u get ( including set items)  are simply not good enf and ur lvl 60 items are better. End game items must be much better. The game and item hunt should begin at lvl 100, not end at it .\n\nIf devs decide to acctuall talk, debug, solve problems, and add some extra content, it would be great. ANd ofc i will change my negative review to positive. But till then, i strongly sugest you to play smthing with good comunity, and with actuall end game content.","April 7","false","85.6"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

Look anywhere on forums or on the internet, the game mechanics are not working properly. I gave hope and leveld 2 characters too level 100 to watch end game and actually gear my character just like Diablo... BUT...unless you do a constructor level 1-80 to farm and then power level a protector well this game cant offer much beyond that.  Protector is the most OP class in the game while others does 1/4 of his damage and not even close of the tankiness the class offers.  If you play multiplayers, some mechanics doesnt work for the player who joins and the game crashes once in a while. The end game in general is a weird system after you paid the game 50$ you are cap to gain the most important game currency "fate points" to 60-100ish  when you need 1000 to get a golden key to be able to buy the best chest to earn the best loots...the most frustrating is its not guaranteed to get it.

Make your way though an "epic" story full of silly lines, breaking the fourth wall and never taking anything serious. Don't expect much of a story though. You go from one weird quest to the next. You actually slaughter your way to it, against bad balanced foes. You can switch the difficulty any time and you will need that  because the game just can't decide if it wants to be a piece of cake or hardcore.\n\nAnother enemy you will be facing is the pathfinding. You'll find yourself in dead-ends, stopped by bushes and trees many times over. You can craft stuff, enchance it... not that it really matters. The items you get from the monsters are usually better anyway. Plus they save you the trouble of trying to figure how the crafting system works. It's far from self-explaining and the informations the game gives you are vague at best.\n\nSeriously, the only "epic" thing so far about this game is the size on my hard disc: more than 50 GBs, including the optional hd textures. You'd think that for such a huge size you'd have all it takes to play the game. Wrong. The characters are saved online and you will need to download them in every new session. A needless feature and a painful one, if you have a slow connection.\n\nThe ingame graphics are nothing special. You can zoom in, but most of the time you have to zoom out as far as possible, since most enemies get attracted and attack you from the other side of the screen. There´s moving grass and you can destroy some barrels and shelves along with burning down grass and bushes with your spells. That´s nice, but on closer look the graphics and effects don´t have much to offer. Even the dying effects of enemies are somewhat lame and have been done better by previous and older games.\n\nTo be fair, the game has some funny moments here and there. Also sometimes you get to choose an answer. Expect nothing complex. Simple yes/no or do/don't do it. Still a choice though. But all things considered I can't recommend "Van Helsing".","May 22","false","9.8"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

It's the best part of the game by far. If you love games like Diablo, or Path of Exile you'll love the way this game plays. Neocore has refined the game, but made it easier then previous titles in my opinion. I had no problems steamrolling through this with my bounty hunter.\n\nSounds:\n\nEverything sounds really great and that comes as no surprise because all of the Van Helsing games have amazing soundtracks, dialog, and voice acting. Van Helsing sounds great, Lady Katarina sounds great, and the supporting cast all sound great. Some of the best tunes I've heard this year has come from Van Helsing.\n\nGraphics:\n\nVan Helsing has always looked really good when compared to other games in it's genre. Final Cut is no different. When everything is maxed out this game looks incredible. The environments are rich with detail, and the character models look good. They're not great, but for this genre they look really good when compared to Path of Exile, and Torchlight.\n\nThe Good:\n\nClasses:\n\nI'll be honest here. I preferred the three original character classes over the six that we have here. The original Van Helsing class is gone. You can no longer be a hunter in this game. He's been split into three different classes and I still don't understand the decision behind it. The other two classes have also been split into multiple classes to make it seem like we have bigger, deeper classes to choose from when in reality we don't. What we have is more character classes to choose from with half of what made the the original characters so great in the first two games.\nAll of the classes aren't bad though. I did enjoy playing as a Bounty Hunter, but he can't compete with my old Hunter class from Van Helsing II.\n\nStory:\n\nIf I would have never played Van Helsing III the story would have been in the great section, but Neocore dropped the ball towards the end of the game. The whole final chapter in this series is just bad. There's no other way to describe it. Van Helsing I, and II were really good games while part III is forgettable and since this game merges all of them together I was forced to experience part III all over again... or at least I would have if a gamebreaking bug didn't prevent from advancing in a quest.\n\nThere's also a lot of pacing issues with this game. Some cutscenes were removed and instead me seeing the beginning scene of Van Helsing II it just starts me off where part I ended. It was confusing because I thought I would get a cutscene.\n\nThe Bad:\n\nSkill Tree:\n\nI think the most important thing in a dungeon crawler is the skill tree. They can make or break the game and they don't do either of those things in this game. The skill tree here is just... meh at best. I skipped the majority of the skill tree with just about every character I played as. The skill tree here just didn't appeal to me because it was broken up between six characters. Skills that the original three classes had were split up between six characters. I don't care what excuse the devs have for this it's unacceptable. The new skill tree is a big disappointment. I'm limited in the ways I want to customize my character because half of the skills on my skill tree is completely useless.\n\nIt's Not Better Than Previous Installments:\n\n\nVan Helsing I, and II are the best games in this four game series. It's only gone downhill from part II and it's a shame. I understand wanting to change your game, but changing them this much is confusing to me. Don't fix what's not broken because you risk breaking it and that's what happened here. If you want to play a great game play Van Helsing II. It's the best game in the series by far. I like the changes that are in this game, but I don't like most of the new character classes that were introduced in part III and I really don't like the new skill trees.\n\nIt Has A Ton Of Bugs:\n\nThe bug that made me quit playing this game made it impossible for me to progress on a quest. I had a level 30 something bounty hunter and I was stuck in the beginning of Van Helsing II. I refused to start a new character and I never got a fix from the devs. They actually just ignored my post on Steam. No one gave me answer so I quit and moved on to another game. When this game is firing on all cylinders it's pretty good. It's not a terrible game and I do like it more than Van Helsing III, but that's not saying much because that game is all kinds of terrible.\n\nI don't understand how you can push a game back twice and not fix the exact same bugs that were present in your first three games.\n\nAnimations:\n\nThe gameplay in this game is great, but the animations are just bad. They feel cheap and if you can ignore that, it's hard trust me, then you'll have some fun. Don't go in expecting Diablo kinds of quality because this studio doesn't have Blizzard's wallet size.\n\nReplay Value:\n\nAt one point I considered Van Helsing one of my favorite games to keep coming back to. That changed after part III and it's no different in the Final Cut. Once all of the bugs are fixed I know that might change, but right now it has no replay value for me at all. I couldn't even give away my extra key because no one wanted it.\n\nThe Verdict:\n\nThe Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing Final Cut isn't a terrible game. It's actually pretty good if you can ignore the bugs, and the fact that it was ten times better a few years ago. If you've never played this series then you'll probably really love this game. I've been playing it since the beginning and it's changed a lot since then and not for the better. Once the bugs are fixed I'm sure that I'll enjoy it a lot more, but I doubt the skill tree will ever change and I know I'll never be able to use my level 60 hunter ever again and that still bothers me because I worked hard on that character.\n\n6/10\n\nFor $44 this game is not worth it. Go buy Diablo III instead. You can both Diablo III and Reaper of Souls for $20 a piece.\n\nFinal Cut is an inprovement over Van Helsing III, but it's literally filled with bugs and I can't recommend this game in this condition. It was fun, but I still prefer the first two games in the series and I recommend you go check those two out instead of buying this one right now.\n\nMy verdict might change in the future once the bugs are taken care of. If you can find this game for about $20 I'll recommend checking it out because there are many games that'll give you this much content for that price, but for $44 you'll be better off buying anything else for around the same price.","November 28, 2015","false","17.7"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","6","15","0","2"

It's the best part of the game by far. If you love games like Diablo, or Path of Exile you'll love the way this game plays. Neocore has refined the game, but made it easier then previous titles in my opinion. I had no problems steamrolling through this with my bounty hunter.\n\nSounds:\n\nEverything sounds really great and that comes as no surprise because all of the Van Helsing games have amazing soundtracks, dialog, and voice acting. Van Helsing sounds great, Lady Katarina sounds great, and the supporting cast all sound great. Some of the best tunes I've heard this year has come from Van Helsing.\n\nGraphics:\n\nVan Helsing has always looked really good when compared to other games in it's genre. Final Cut is no different. When everything is maxed out this game looks incredible. The environments are rich with detail, and the character models look good. They're not great, but for this genre they look really good when compared to Path of Exile, and Torchlight.\n\nThe Good:\n\nClasses:\n\nI'll be honest here. I preferred the three original character classes over the six that we have here. The original Van Helsing class is gone. You can no longer be a hunter in this game. He's been split into three different classes and I still don't understand the decision behind it. The other two classes have also been split into multiple classes to make it seem like we have bigger, deeper classes to choose from when in reality we don't. What we have is more character classes to choose from with half of what made the the original characters so great in the first two games.\nAll of the classes aren't bad though. I did enjoy playing as a Bounty Hunter, but he can't compete with my old Hunter class from Van Helsing II.\n\nStory:\n\nIf I would have never played Van Helsing III the story would have been in the great section, but Neocore dropped the ball towards the end of the game. The whole final chapter in this series is just bad. There's no other way to describe it. Van Helsing I, and II were really good games while part III is forgettable and since this game merges all of them together I was forced to experience part III all over again... or at least I would have if a gamebreaking bug didn't prevent from advancing in a quest.\n\nThere's also a lot of pacing issues with this game. Some cutscenes were removed and instead me seeing the beginning scene of Van Helsing II it just starts me off where part I ended. It was confusing because I thought I would get a cutscene.\n\nThe Bad:\n\nSkill Tree:\n\nI think the most important thing in a dungeon crawler is the skill tree. They can make or break the game and they don't do either of those things in this game. The skill tree here is just... meh at best. I skipped the majority of the skill tree with just about every character I played as. The skill tree here just didn't appeal to me because it was broken up between six characters. Skills that the original three classes had were split up between six characters. I don't care what excuse the devs have for this it's unacceptable. The new skill tree is a big disappointment. I'm limited in the ways I want to customize my character because half of the skills on my skill tree is completely useless.\n\nIt's Not Better Than Previous Installments:\n\n\nVan Helsing I, and II are the best games in this four game series. It's only gone downhill from part II and it's a shame. I understand wanting to change your game, but changing them this much is confusing to me. Don't fix what's not broken because you risk breaking it and that's what happened here. If you want to play a great game play Van Helsing II. It's the best game in the series by far. I like the changes that are in this game, but I don't like most of the new character classes that were introduced in part III and I really don't like the new skill trees.\n\nIt Has A Ton Of Bugs:\n\nThe bug that made me quit playing this game made it impossible for me to progress on a quest. I had a level 30 something bounty hunter and I was stuck in the beginning of Van Helsing II. I refused to start a new character and I never got a fix from the devs. They actually just ignored my post on Steam. No one gave me answer so I quit and moved on to another game. When this game is firing on all cylinders it's pretty good. It's not a terrible game and I do like it more than Van Helsing III, but that's not saying much because that game is all kinds of terrible.\n\nI don't understand how you can push a game back twice and not fix the exact same bugs that were present in your first three games.\n\nAnimations:\n\nThe gameplay in this game is great, but the animations are just bad. They feel cheap and if you can ignore that, it's hard trust me, then you'll have some fun. Don't go in expecting Diablo kinds of quality because this studio doesn't have Blizzard's wallet size.\n\nReplay Value:\n\nAt one point I considered Van Helsing one of my favorite games to keep coming back to. That changed after part III and it's no different in the Final Cut. Once all of the bugs are fixed I know that might change, but right now it has no replay value for me at all.

This rerelease of the franchise is a bundle that contains all three of the original games with added in content.\n\nAs if you had read the comment to this review, you might have seen that previously the end-game content was locked to online only, well as you see, Neocore actually cares about what players think of their products (something that is lacking in the games industry as a whole) and have introduced changes to the game to have the same content (minus the online interactions, such as daily events ect) made available to everyone should either parties internet go down for whatever reason.\n\nI can whole heartily recommend this game as the storys itself is well written and has a good length to it. The gameplay is exactly what you would expect from an isometric ARPG, as in it plays flawlessly. The end-game content (known as scenarios/adventure mode) offer unlimited replayability with randomized missions for you to play through.\n\nThe only two downsides that I can think of at this time of writting this review is that there are some balance issues but those are to be expected, as well as the seperation of online and offline characters (which has not been done before in the series). While I see its use and purpose, I still see that as a drawback but now that all content is equal across the board, it is hardly an issue to even mention.\n\nThere are some bugs as well but as I can only speak for the ones I have encountered and they have not been many, or game breaking in the time I have spent playing (in both online and offline).\n\nIf you want a numeric score I give Van Helsing Finalcut a 8.5/10","November 7, 2015","true","14.1"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","29","2","7","0","17"

Instead, this is a trilogy of two good Van Helsing games, and one questionable one, wrapped tightly in a frustratingly unbalanced and bugged package.\nMobs are uninspired with only one or two strategies: zerg rush or sit back and shoot with 100% accuracy. Both have badly scaled stats that'll leave you tearing your hair out or toggling the difficulty. Yeah, that's a thing, you're not locked into your difficulty when you start the game. Thank goodness for small favors, but I can tell it's just a way of saving face since nobody at Neocore seems to be good with numbers, character growth pacing, or debugging. (I have quests that were bugged since the trilogy and they're still not fixed)\nGear doesn't matter (in a loot game of all things) key skills in all classes were significantly nerfed, but at least the game is generous with gold since it's your leading currency for deciding to revive yourself from where you just died to crowd control resistant swarms or back at your base and walk a bit to die to the same mobs within seconds. Of course there are plenty of exploits and builds made specifically to exploit them, but why bother when you're only going to use 1/5 of your available skills just to survifve?\nThe tagline says final cut, but it plays like an early alpha. I can't reccomend this for it's current retail. Maybe get it on sale. But there's way better (properly balanced) options out there.","January 12","false","70.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I liked that there was set gear to collect and that it was possible to load one's character from the first game into the second game.  This game, like the third in the series, does not allow a player to load in an existing character.  In addition, the set gear is no longer in the game until the very end and only if your character reaches the highest level possible (100).\n\nThe game as published currently is not well-balanced.  My first new character was a Bounty Hunter and I was able to chew my way through to the third game with no problem.  At that point I started to get bored so I made a constructor.  I had fun with that character up until the bits in the second game when there are bombardments that fall on Borgova.  The constructor relies on having a multitude of bot and turret constructs that do damage and protect him, and I found it next to impossible to avoid having my various constructs blown up by one to two bombardment hits.  At this point I just decided it was pointless to continue as there are multiple times when your character is hit by bombardments in game and also in the adventure maps.  I went looking for and found a new game to play.\n\nIf you have not played the first two Van Helsing games, then I recommend playing those as I found them to be more entertaining and the classes better constructed. If you played those already then I suggest waiting for a balance and/or update to this game (or using a mod if you really want to play it).\n\nI really wanted to like this game more as I enjoy the setting, story, and steam punk atmosphere and critters.  Oh well... so many other games to enjoy and so little time.\n\n","January 14","false","49.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There was definitely power balance struggle and all three releases felt like Beta versions. Most disappointing was VH3. However this final cut version is finally polished product. It was nice to receive free copy from Neocoregames, as I own all three games all ready.\n\nVoice acting is superb with vibes of Slavic mythology and humour.\n\nGame play is somehow closer to Diablo 2, where you had to think about you character build and Katarina adds double enjoyment for those who want to experiment with different builds etc.\nIt gets even better... You can reset all ability and skill points for both: main character and support AI Katarina. So... no more entire new game replays.\n\nIt is better than Diablo 3. Because D3 is just too simple. Skill are all handed to you as long as you get to higher levels (XP). On other hand “Van Helsing: Final Cut” you have to think how to build your set-up, plus upgrade sidekick Katarina`s abilities to suit your own build.\n\nSo... Small studio like “Neocoregames” outperformed giants like “Blizzard”... Simply because they provided “old school success” formula to masses. These is no need to do “dumb” ARPG games where you just run around and click your mouse a lot without thinking.","February 8","true","55.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Well worth the investment.\n\nFinal Cut combines the three Van Helsing titles into one playable game.  I loved the first two Van Helsing, but was disappointed by third title for several reasons -- most prominent was the inability to carry over the character you had spent two games building.\n\nFortunately, that complaint and others are addressed in the Final Cut.  In the Final Cut, you use the class system introduced in the third game from the very beginning, meaning you can build a single character through the entire playthrough, all the way to level 100! While I personally preferred the class sytemes of VHI and VHII, the six classes are nice.  They each play very differently, too, so whatever your ARPG style, you should find something equivalent here.\n\nNew to the Van Helsing series? Here are some pros:\n\n*Good story.  Not life-changing, no, but quite developed for an ARPG\n\n*Great companion.  Katarina is not only actually useful in combat, but the dialogue between her and Van Helsing is one of the true charms of the game\n\n*Well-developed and varied class options (see above)\n\n*Generous loot drops\n\n*Interesting and varied enemies.  You can't just blindly click the left button and wade across the screen.\n\n*Adventure mode gives replay value beyond the storyline\n\nNOTE: This game is free for anyone who purchased the first three Van Helsings.  So, if you happen to find the three VH's cheap somewhere, you can buy them individually and maybe pay less than they're asking for Final Cut.  Even if you can't, I think Final Cut is worth the price.","February 10","true","35.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Instead, this is a trilogy of two good Van Helsing games, and one questionable one, wrapped tightly in a frustratingly unbalanced and bugged package.\nMobs are uninspired with only one or two strategies: zerg rush or sit back and shoot with 100% accuracy. Both have badly scaled stats that'll leave you tearing your hair out or toggling the difficulty. Yeah, that's a thing, you're not locked into your difficulty when you start the game. Thank goodness for small favors, but I can tell it's just a way of saving face since nobody at Neocore seems to be good with numbers, character growth pacing, or debugging. (I have quests that were bugged since the trilogy and they're still not fixed)\nGear doesn't matter (in a loot game of all things) key skills in all classes were significantly nerfed, but at least the game is generous with gold since it's your leading currency for deciding to revive yourself from where you just died to crowd control resistant swarms or back at your base and walk a bit to die to the same mobs within seconds. Of course there are plenty of exploits and builds made specifically to exploit them, but why bother when you're only going to use 1/5 of your available skills just to survifve?\nThe tagline says final cut, but it plays like an early alpha. I can't reccomend this for it's current retail. Maybe get it on sale. But there's way better (properly balanced) options out there.","January 12","false","70.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I liked that there was set gear to collect and that it was possible to load one's character from the first game into the second game.  This game, like the third in the series, does not allow a player to load in an existing character.  In addition, the set gear is no longer in the game until the very end and only if your character reaches the highest level possible (100).\n\nThe game as published currently is not well-balanced.  My first new character was a Bounty Hunter and I was able to chew my way through to the third game with no problem.  At that point I started to get bored so I made a constructor.  I had fun with that character up until the bits in the second game when there are bombardments that fall on Borgova.  The constructor relies on having a multitude of bot and turret constructs that do damage and protect him, and I found it next to impossible to avoid having my various constructs blown up by one to two bombardment hits.  At this point I just decided it was pointless to continue as there are multiple times when your character is hit by bombardments in game and also in the adventure maps.  I went looking for and found a new game to play.\n\nIf you have not played the first two Van Helsing games, then I recommend playing those as I found them to be more entertaining and the classes better constructed. If you played those already then I suggest waiting for a balance and/or update to this game (or using a mod if you really want to play it).\n\nI really wanted to like this game more as I enjoy the setting, story, and steam punk atmosphere and critters.  Oh well... so many other games to enjoy and so little time.\n\n","January 14","false","49.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Cough.... OCD.... The game is vast, but very samey, but this is broken up quiet nicely by the random tower defence game, the random managment of people and a pet, the odd little pop culture nods.\n\nThe story is ridiculous - but having played Dragon age origin, which was vast, compeling and had a nice tactical combat system and then played the sequels - OK, story but truly horrible gameplay, I like the way this game plays.\n\nIt is massively glitchy, but nothing game breaking.\n\nThe voice acting and dialoge is Panto Porno, but fun. The AI and combat balancing is a little hap hazard, but that just means that it takes you by surprise when think you are going to breeze through a section, before getting lynched and brutaly violated by a mob of rat squirrels. But as there are no real consiquences of dying outside of hardcore mode, stop moaning and make better choices.\n\nBetter choices, like buying this game when it is next on sale...

The game is infact a stitching together of the original first 3 Van Helsing games.  And you play through the series from beginning to end.\n\nVan Helsing games play alot like Diablo/Torchlight/Path of Exile ect, with added elements of Tower Defence games occasionally as well.   There are alot of jokes from Katerina and Van Helsing speaking throughout the game, as well as alot of pop culture references as well.\n\nThis game is quite different from the originals, as it brings in different elements from the 3 different games, as well as adding some new elements.   For instance if you played Van Helsing 1, you will notice the Character Skills/stats are alot different, and the skill trees are way different as well.  Also things like Mana and Health potions are no longer required purchases from the store, but instead are on timers, making them less spammable, but you also don't run out of them half way through a dungeon.  They have made alot of improvements visually to the game as well .\n\nAlso as a bonus, the creators of the Van Helsing games will give you the game for free if you go on their website, and give them your Steam account name, and own all 3 Van Helsing games as a thank you for your support.","May 24","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
