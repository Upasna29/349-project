It is a representation of the opression that the middle class faces with a rapidly expanding wealth gap.

The way Crab Cakes Rescue looks you can guess it's rather simply game. Doesn't have fancy graphics, doesn't have fluid animations. Just small levels and big number of them. I was enjoying game at some point - until platform levels happened... it's not like these levels are hard, it's just pure luck: maybe your very little crab will make it until platform dissapears but if not, you can start again playing this level. From this point all the fun, all the pleasure playing this rather casual game went somewhere. Also, getting 3 stars on every level is really hard and not enjoyable. I mean, it's good that game can be hard too BUT only if it's due to level difficulty, not technical issues. This price is also too high, since Crab Cakes Rescue feel like really poor made flash game and it's not worth even price at some bigger promotions. I can't recommend it for puzzle or platformer fans, you will really feel dissapointed at some point.","May 14","false","11.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
