You start off with a meteor falling from the sky so you go to investigate. Once you get to the crash site this white blob jumps out from the meteor and at first you are scared of it but then you become curious and become frends! Once you get back to your treehouse base a jar of beans on the table next to your bed falls over and a single black bean falls out. The blob eats it and turns into a ladder allowing you to climb up to a higher level of your base.\n\nThroughout the game you will collect many different coloured beans that each allow the blob to change into a different form. You will need to use these to overcome obsticles and to safely get a boy and his blob to their next destination.\n\nAlso did I mention you can hug the blob?","January 19","true","2.3"," 85 of 99 people (86%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","86","85","99","13","10"

I loved it. I could only beat it with a Game Genie, though. I bought and played through the Wii version, also. I loved it for different reasons. One of them being: You can beat it without a Game Genie.\n\nThis appears to be a faithful and stable port of the Wii version. I find the game incredibly nostalgic and lovely in many ways. This is likely the influence of the game's director, Sean Velasco  (The director and designer of Shovel Knight).\n\nSure it is more linear and not as challenging as the original. But it captures the soul of AB&HB and presents it in a more light-hearted (and finishable) package.\n\nSkip one trip to Starbucks this week and give it a whirl.","January 20","true","1.7"," 25 of 28 people (89%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","89","25","28","4","0"

This game is adorable, colorful, beautiful, and runs great on PC! I haven't tried it with keyboard and mouse, but it works fine with my X Box controller. Controls are tight and simple. Beautiful animation, music, and sound. So far the port is exactly what it should be.\n\nSo what is A Boy and his Blob?\n\nIt's a remake of an 8 bit nintendo game that had an awesome concept without the capability to pull it off properly or do it any real justice. Basically, you are a boy who befriends an alien blob that eats jellybeans on a mission to save Blobonia from an evil tyranical emperor. Depending on what kind of jellybean he eats he will become different things. If you feed him a licorice jellybean he will become a licorice ladder for example. You use these various transformations to solve puzzles and traverse the levels. Unlike the old version, you will never run out of Jelly Beans so you don't need to worry about that. You are free to experiment although so far there has been only one right answer to the puzzles. Maybe that will change later on. I haven't played enough of it to determine the difficulty yet. I don't know how tough later levels get.\n\nIf you like casual puzzle platformers you really really should have a look at this. I can't understand why this game was not a bigger hit on Wii. :( Anyway, all of this is a mere 9$. Come on! Grab yourself a pack of Jellybeans, sit back, and let boy and blob take you on an adventure!\n\nOh, and there is a hug button. You can hug your blob, and it's the cutest thing in the history of video games.","January 19","true","1.0"," 26 of 33 people (79%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","79","26","33","4","0"

You're toast if you become too complacent though as the difficulty really ramps up later on.\n\nEvery level utilizes a different combination of transformations. The addition of a new forms and their uses in conjunction with other transformations really opens up each level to a tremendous variety of mechanics, a variety far greater than I typically see in puzzle platformers. As an added bonus, the collectable trinkets in each level decorate your home base. Kick ♥♥♥.\n\nThe one glaring, unusual downside in this game is the lack of punctuality.\n\nLet's say an enemy is about to shoot me and I want to reflect the attack back at him. In order to do so I need to open the jellybean selection window, throw the jellybean, watch the blob chase it down and eat it, watch him become a sheild, walk to the sheild, pick it up, and finally engage the slow-moving reflect stance.\n\nMost games you just press L and you're immediately primed to reflect anything.\n\nBy the time you pull out your sheild here though you've been shot, and your single hp is gone. You're dead and you get to start over. Thankfully checkpoints are very numerous and there's no life counter.\n\nIf you've got a dozen hours to spare you should check out this wii-shop classic.\n\nBy the way only about 1% of the people who started this game bothered to beat it. Not only are you stupid, but you're missing out.","February 13","true","12.0"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","20","23","2","0"

Quite possibly one of the most charming games I have ever played also on the Nintendo Wii.\n\nA Boy and His Blob is simply put a game about a lone boy who happens to come across a space blob, reminiscent of Gleep and Gloop from the Herculoids. Almost instantly and without any influencing factors the boy and the blob create a bond. I mean even Elliot and E.T. had to work up to each other, and not without the help of some Reeses Pieces.\n\nThe game takes place in a varying set of locations including forests, caverns, and more, made up with different levels. Each level features both platforming and puzzle challenges throughout as well as an assortment of enemy creatures also similar to our sidekick, the Blob. If you've ever played the original NES classic, you'll feel right at home with the games main feature, being that blob can transform into different objects through the consumption of different flavored jellybeans. This may again be somewhat of a throwback to E.T., though I don't know. You control the boy, and do the platforming, and feed the blob jellybeans and he transforms. The different objects the blob can transform into include things like ladders, trampolines, bubbles, and more. And each stage has a different set of jellybeans to help solve the different puzzles and even find hidden areas throughout. The platforming may lean a little more to the challenging side as opposed to being relaxed, as the "boy" does not have a very high jump. Luckily he does have air control. But his very small jump arc means jumping over some gaps and enemies requires good timing. It's not a constant thing, but you'll see how important it is in the very first stage. The game is extremely pleasant and magical looking, featuring hand-drawn characters and environments, and has said to have drawn "inspiration from a number of sources, including the films of Hayao Miyazaki.". The music is equally enchanting featuring some nice relaxing medleys of both original pieces and even something for the fans of the original NES game.\n\nI did not want to make a big long review for the game itself but rather sum it up briefly. It's a great game! It's faithful to the original NES game in some ways, while still bringing its own originality and flavor to the new (when it came to the Wii) title.\n\nI actually wanted to instead discuss how the port is. So, how is it? Well, I'm really mixed on this one.\n\nControls: The controls are all fully mappable on both keyboard and controller. This is a plus. I'm glad to see they did not take the easy way. There is no need to go into any menus either to switch between keyboard or controller. Just pick up and use whichever method of control you prefer.\n\nGraphic settings: This is where I'm a bit torn. There's not much here. You can change the resolution which is great. You can change the game from fullscreen to windowed to even borderless windowed, which is fantastic! But that is where it ends. I honestly did not expect things like aliasing options to be implemented. I mean the game looks fine on its own without the need for an aliasing option. Well maybe for the far background, but it's not a big deal. No, what bugs me instead is the lack of v-sync. A v-sync option is badly needed for this title. Right off the bat you can see screen tearing here and there. It's not a game breaking flaw, but for some people it is going to call a cause for complaints and gripes. And you know those people are going to be vocal about it. I personally would love to see a v-snc option patched in. Luckily some cards come with the option to force v-sync into games. But there are still some people playing without graphics cards who will see this as an issue.\n\nIn any case, v-sync issue aside, this is a wonderful port, and  any fan of the original NES classic or someone who missed this title on the Wii should give this game a try.","January 19","true","2.5"," 20 of 28 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","20","28","2","2"

You find him and become best friends! Then you find out that he can change shapes based on different flavors of jellybeans you can feed him!\n\nThe graphics and story are charming, the gameplay is pretty normal for a platformer, with the changeable blob twist. He can become a ladder, a balloon, a hole in the ground (This one I'm still confused about) a trampoline, and so much more.\n\nIf you are on the fence about buying this game, you should just end up landing very firmly on the side of buy it right now.

I thought it was interesting that WayForward decided to run with this IP, considering A Boy and His Blob is a strangely household name as far as NES games go (at least, it had a few animations in the flash heyday of VGDC along with the likes of Mario, Castlevania, etc.). But it tends to feel unfinished: we have music cutting out at the wrong time, switches not doing what they're supposed to, sequence-breaking, blurry graphics, improper stage tiling, and a respawn point on the second-to-last stage which kills you indefinitely. But my biggest issue with the game is the fact that you need to “call” blob three times to draw him to your position immediately.\n\nAnd if you can believe it, I had a lot of fun with this game. In fact, I went out of my way to do everything there was to do. You drop candy for the blob and make use of his abilities. As the successor to a puzzle-platformer which gained some notoriety in the late 80s, I think it does a great job. This genre is important to me, and the core gameplay is all there. You find yourself considering the inventory in creative, challenging ways. The art style captures the simplicity of an NES game while appearing modern; and that’s great. If you enjoy where WayForward is taking Shantae, you can probably appreciate A Boy and His Blob.","May 31","true","27.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","4"

Then the evil king put on a crown and laughed and said "You are going to time out" but Boy said "No I will not go to time out. I will feed Blob a bean that will make him a cannon to shoot me, and then I will ride him like a rocket ship really fast, and then I will be in a bubble so nobody can touch me, and then I'll jump really high on a jump-oline."\n\nI don't disagree with any of it.","May 30","true","10.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","2","2","2","0"

As you control the Boy, you give Blob jelly beans which give him different powers and allow him to transform to help the Boy traverse the levels. This sounds like a nice setup, right? Not so fast. Sadly, ABAHB is quite generic and frankly basic.\n\nImmediately upon playing the game I was annoyed with the Boy’s jumping, or lack thereof. He seemingly struggles to clear the most basic of jumps and movement overall feels quite sluggish. In a game with one hit kills, unresponsive controls are a big no-no. And while there is not a lot of fighting per se, this was an immediate flaw to me and hampered my enjoyment from the start.\n\nWhile Blob’s powers and abilities are cool and the concept of you, the player, being powerless and relying on the AI to help you is novel direction, it’s undermined by bland level design. Blob’s powers are fun to use but I found myself cruising through the levels without much effort and I never had to guess or figure out what to do next. The uninspired levels cause the game to feel infantile almost. Perhaps the game was meant to be aimed towards a younger demographic and I just missed the memo. But as someone who consider themselves quite versed in platformers and demands a certain quality, ABAHB falls short of that.\n\nA Boy and His Blob is not a bad game by any stretch of the imagination it’s just innocuous and bland, I don’t know which is worse. All of my gripes come from someone who expects my platformers to be competent and well thought out, and I found neither here. I was hoping that ABAHB would lean more towards developer WayForward’s DuckTales: Remasterd (which I loved) than BloodRayne: Betrayl (which I hated). While I would put ABAHB closer to DuckTales I simply can’t give it a strong endorsement.\n","June 5","false","2.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It was incredibly difficult, especially as a kid.  This game (unless it drastically changes partway through) is not that game.  The art style is really nice, it feels modern while staying true to the original material.  The audio...  exists.  Hearing the boy call the blob repeatedly gets very annoying.\n\nThe game play is best described as tedious.  The original game was tedious, and I was hoping a remake would improve on that, but this is somehow worse.  You have to stop moving and bring up a poorly working menu to switch jelly beans.  So much time is spent just waiting for the blob to bounce around to where you want him to go, wait for him to get a chest, wait for his balloon to float back over.\n\nMaybe I'm mis-remembering why the original was good back in its day, but this game doesn't capture it for me.  Were it a standalone game and not a remake of an old classic, it would be completely terrible.  Being a remake, if you want to see some updated visual and a mediocre puzzle game it could be worth picking up really cheap.

When he goes to explore the crash, he finds a friendly white blob that follows the boy back to his tree home. From there, the boy finds out when he feeds the blob jellybeans, the blob takes different forms. Thus, the journey begins...\n\nOf course, the adventure will not be easy. Evil blobs, puzzles, and pits stand before you. You will have to rely on your brains and your blob to progress. The evil blobs are easily disposed of and sometimes they are beneficial. However, some of the puzzles and pits can be a bit of trouble.\n\nThere are four worlds with 10 levels each. Each one of these levels has 3 treasure chests that, when all 3 are found, unlock a challenge level for you to play. When you then beat the challenge level, concept art/music/movie is unlocked for your viewing.\n\nSlight spoiler:\nThere are 2 extra levels in the forest world once you beat the game. These levels unlock 2 more challenge levels for you to play through!\n\nIt is really enjoyable seeing a new blob transformation in your bean arsenal. There are over 10 blob transformations (which I won't dive into because I don't want to spoil them). Each one of these transformations does a different thing, and you will need to know how to use each one of them to their fullest to succeed.\n\nThe controls can be a bit frustrating here and there, but once you understand how to use them, you will quickly get the hang of it.\n\nThe blob selection screen can also be frustrating. It can be hard to select the blob transformations in the corners of the screen. Overall, the system is pretty well polished.\n\nThe graphics are pretty good, but, with my computer at least, when I set it to a lower resolution and put it in full screen mode, there was some screen tearing that got annoying. It's not a big issue, but it ruined a bit of the atmosphere.\n\nThe music was top notch. I enjoyed every soundtrack this game had.\n\nThe story was fun as well. It didn't really make me feel emotions during the few cutscenes, which was a little weak. But I enjoyed the story nevertheless.\n\nOverall, this is a fun, family-friendly game. It takes a bit of skill and a bit of thinking to complete. The journey is worth it.

I like the animations!\n4 worlds with plenty of levels + challenge levels for each. The game is very long.\nVery nice and fitting music! You will feel relaxed and pumped appropriately!Bad\nNo explanation for anything. I had no clue some stuff is even interactable\nAnnoying as hell boss fights. They are mostly luck-based rather than skill tbh.\nBlob's AI can be buggy at times which can screw up your timing for puzzles/boss fights.Port issues:\nThose are fairly minor and luckily don't hinder the gameplay:\nEverything is poorly upscaled from the original game which causes issues like this[images.akamai.steamusercontent.com]  There are minor freezes/hiccups when sound gets played. (SSD might lower this idk?)\nThere is something wrong with deadzones, so selecting the correct jellybean from the wheel is very buggy at times.\nDespite all this I think the game is worth it, if you like platformers since WayForward did the original NES game justice as they did with DuckTales.","May 24","true","16.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The exploration of the underworld and Blobolonia is replaced by a level based puzzle game, where you're given an unlimited supply of just the beans needed to pass that level. No bean counting.

Might be a "later play" game that you might come back to, but not often.

It does lack some polishing and there are few times that precision platforming is irritating due to games movement mechanic, but overall I can easily recommend it if you'll spot this game on sale. It is not worth the full price of (as of the time of writing this review) is 10 EU. I love the graphics, I like the music and I enojy the platforming of this cute little adventure.","May 16","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The controls have some accuracy and responsiveness problems, but the gameplay is simple enough that this doesn't get particularly frustrating except for a couple boss fights and optional challenges. Tributes to the NES original are present enough for nostalgia purposes but subtle enough not to break immersion, and the gameplay doesn't have any of the major flaws of the NES game. Most story beats are very well-presented, and story moments are always brief enough not to interrupt the flow of exploration and puzzle-solving.\n\nThe puzzle and platforming complexity never quite take off, possibly because the designers realized the slow pace of the controls put a limit on how intricate things could comfortably get. If you need to be seriously challenged, skip this game (I suggest Escape Goat 2 for that purpose, although its secret-finding and exploration elements are weaker than this game's).\n\nThere is no real replayability once you've found all the secrets and solved all the optional challenges, but the secrets and challenges do add hours of playability beyond just reaching the ending. (I took 15 hours to finish everything; I'd estimate it was 6 hours of main game, 9 hours of optional content.)\n\n\n\n","May 18","true","15.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When there should be text there isn't and when there is it sometimes redundant.\nControls are clunky and not responding well.\nI missed a chest in the first chapter. I cannot replay it unless I delete my progress and restart.\nEDIT: I couldn't until I quit and entered a second time, only then I could replay levels.\n\nMusic and animations are nice but not outstanding. Can't compare to original game since I've never played it.\n\nFor the 1$ it cost me through Humble Bundle it was a great deal. For 10$... not quite sure...\n\nAll in all not a challenging game and not bad game either so thumb up.","May 15","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LonMcGregor/recommended/281200/","LonMcGregor","LonM","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LonMcGregor/","303 products in account","This game definitely looks nice, but it is far too slow paced.\n\nThe hand drawn graphics give the game a nice fairy-tale sort of style, and are very high quality. Same goes for the music.\n\nThe problem with the game is the pacing in both the menus, the game and the in-game menus. It's all just slow. I don't mean that my computer can't render it fast enough, I mean it's just paced slow.\n\nFor example: This is a platformer game, where the individual levels/worlds are very segmented. I.e. there's no run-off from the end of one level to the start of the next. Now, on its own, this wouldn't be a problem, but because you're sent back to the main menu, which is one of those in-game things where you have to walk around it to navigate it, it kind of breaks you out of the 'zone' of the game.\n\nAlso, in-game, I feel as if it takes far too long to switch the blob's tactics. You place a 'bean', call the blob over, wait for its animation to finish, use the blob, then you need to call the blob again once you're done. The large number of steps this requires just feels clunky and slow.\n\nIn other words, unless you're a really laid-back person who likes things slow, don't play this game.","May 25","false","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Each bean does something different to the blob that makes it turn into something that helps you.\n\nPros:\n- Absolutley gorgeous art style and animation.\n- A variety of jelly beans\n- Short-ish but interesting levels.\n\nCons:\n- The majority of the first (of 4 as i understand) worlds is all tutorial, which seems a bit like it overstays its welcome.","May 21","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"
