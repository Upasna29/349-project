The first step to any jigsaw puzzle is finding the edge pieces of course.  A button to segregate them would be nice.\nPieces "snap to" the puzzle grid instead of each other.  This makes it impossible to put together portions of the puzzle that you know go together without randomly moving your mouse around until you accidentally find where one piece in the block goes in the grid.\nNo screen resolution settings.  Playing on a 2560x1440 monitor was quite a challenge from an eye strain perspective.  To make this worse, I tried to move the window to a 1920x1080 monitor and the menu no longer functioned.  Had to Alt-F4 out of the app.\nNot enough variation in piece shapes (see next point).  Especially for patches of mostly one color it would be nice to be able to make an educated guess based on piece shape instead of randomly moving a piece until it "snaps".\nNo zoom feature.  Since most of the pieces are too similar in shape, it would be nice to be able to zoom in on the pieces to determine subtle differences to help you solve.\nPoor screen real estate usage and piece management.  Again at 2560x1440, the puzzle only took up about 45% of the width of the display.  The game does not allow you to move pieces outside of its limited graphic area which makes sorting pieces by color tedious at best, if not impossible especially on the harder difficulty levels.\nSummary:\nFor less than $3 on sale, this was not a horrible bargain.  However I would recommend that the devs study Microsoft Jigsaw and steal the user interface in a future update.  Overall 4.0/10.0.\n","April 25","false","0.6"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","10","13","0","1"

Each piece of art used follows a very similiar style and despite being organized into multiple regional categories, each puzzle does not feel unique enough to keep the player engaged. Unfortunately, as of this writing (11.May.2016), the title suffers from a variety of problems that make it very difficult to consider it as being anywhere near completion.\n\nQuickly clicking into a puzzle seems to cause puzzles to auto-complete immediately\nGame resolution is very limited, leaving the larger puzzles sizes incredibly difficult to work with\nWhen pieces are vertically aligned, occasionally a piece will become locked off-screen","May 11","false","25.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I would recommend against purchasing until these have been fixed,","May 16","false","3.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

You can't match 2 pieces together. To solve/finish image, you have to put each piece in the right place in the image frame. That's what ruins this game.\n\nAs for other parts - this game has 3 difficulties: easy which is way too easy, normal which is ok, and hard, where pieces are too small for small screens and with dark images ... it gets way too hard.\nAbout those images - I've started on hard with carribbean ships - it can make you hate this game, really. This bundle of images start really dark so it may look like solving 300 pieces blank puzzle ... but hey, it's not classic puzzle, so it's even worse. After you try solving some images in easier difficulty, you should get used to this not-puzzle-like game style.\n\nOne thing, devs should add to this game is some marking - you should know which images you have finished on which difficulty. Why? Because to get achievements you have to complete all images that fall for specific achievement, i.e. to get Asian Ships achievement you have to solve all 10 asian images at least 3 times - on every difficulty and the game does not tell you which images you've already solved on hard ... if you want to get all achievements, then better write it down ;)\n\nMusic in this game is not bad and not good. At some point, when doing hard image, you will simply turn it off ;P\n\nTo sum it up - not a great game, as it could be, but it's nice puzzle-like game for big screens.","May 3","true","29.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

With that said, it does have two issues.  The puzzle pieces are quite small.  On the medium (200 pieces) and hard (300 pieces) level, they are very small and very hard to make out.  Once a puzzle is finished, no matter the level, it is marked for reference.  Finishing the puzzle on another level does not add a new marker.  This makes it difficult to keep track of what puzzles have been completed with what levels.  This would be a handy feature as the achievements center around finishing on the different levels.  An interesting note:  one can float a puzzle piece around the board and it will lock into place whether it is attached to another piece or not.  I do recommend the game though with a touch of patience...","April 20","true","58.3"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"
