Other people will tell you the RNG is rigged. Yet other people will defend it with their lives. Blood Bowl is just not a game that respects you, especially if you go out there and try to win by murder. It will spank you, waterboard you and then anally invade you with spiked baseballbat that has glasshards glued on for good measure.\n\nI have had my trial by fire on the boardgame and got butchered by experienced players. It was enough to not want to play anymore, mostly because of the discussions with the rulebook in hand. Yet, I was also constantly drawn back to it until I got absorbed by Epic and built myself a nice Eldar army.\nBut then I got the 360 version and was hit over the head with a game that applies the rulebook to a fault. No more sneaking stuff past my opponent, no more obfuscating the rules with 'you're interpreting the rules wrong, muppet!'. Instead, I got steamrolled over and over again, until I wised up and started to take the full time allowance on a turn, always trying to get at double dice on every action that needs them. I begun to make progress, but the on-line was so horrid I turned away from the game.\n\nToday, I decided to buy the Chaos Edition for PC on a whim. Fact is that I'm not that into GW-games anymore. I sold off my hobby some time ago, mostly because I outgrew the demographic. Whenever I walk into the GW-store, I feel like a child-molester for one and inviting a kid over to play a game of Epic just has too many negative connotations to it.\nGetting back in the saddle was easier than I thought, but much of that is in selecting the team that supports my play-style instead of a team that looks bad-♥♥♥ but is a dog to manage.\n\nBlood Bowl looks very pretty to my eyes. Cyanide did not go for flashy imagery but instead kept it simple and to the point. Game music is likewise utilized and during the matches there is a duo-presentation by two dudes who sadly will have run out of new things to say after you've played a few matches.\n\nI have not yet played with the Blitz rules, opting to play Classic-rules (Read GW-authentic) instead. The Classic-rules play by the boardgame rules and follows that ruleset to the letter, which results in nailbiting matches, as long as you play on Hard. I don't say this to be leet. On Easy, you'll win. On Medium, the AI will anally probe you. On hard, the AI gets slammed by the rules as hard as you are. How that can be, I don't know. The game was like this on the 360 too.\n\nWinning thus depends on team-choice and choosing a team should be a factor of your playstyle. For me personally that meant a choice between the Dark Elves or the Amazons. After having tried a few games with the Dark Elves I noticed that I couldn't pull off miracle plays with them. I like to dodge and play a passing game and the Dark Elves are the proverbial team for that. (Still the best DLC I bought on the 360.)\nI started over, going for the Amazons this time, who all have Dodge as a natural skill. At first I felt it was hopeless, but slowly I was getting the results. After being butchered a few times, I got a handle on the Amazons and started to fight the AI to a stand-still. Some time later I managed to win a match with a miracle play, passing the ball from the midfield-line to a Catcher in the end-zone.\n\nBlood Bowl is not an easy game. One of the first things a new player should learn is that tackle-zones are the backbone of Blood Bowl. Each pawn on the field has a tackle-zone, consisting of 8 squares around that pawn. Pawns that have overlapping tackle-zone empower eachother, making offence and defence easier. For offence, blocking an enemy pawn is a snap if it has base to base contact with other pawns that are friendly to you. For defence, understanding that tackle-zones are only good for enemy pawns entering it is key.\n\nAs you play matches, your players will level up, provided they did something that gives them points. There are many ways a player can get EXP and not all of them are obvious. Blood Bowl does however apply them according to the official boardgame rules (if you play Classic, which I recommend.) and does so rigidly. Should you ever question the game's judgement, crosscheck the decision with the ruleset, which is included in the game. I have not been able to fault it sofar.\nLeveling your players up will allow you to give your players extra skills. There are loads of skills, but not all of them will suit your players or your style. Take the time to read the description of skills. But most of them are obvious. The first extra skill a Catcher should get is Sure Hands. A Runner should get Sure Feet quickly. A Blitzer should keep an eye out for Break-Tackle.\n\nBlood Bowl comes with a hefty Single Player experience. First there is the tutorial. This is scripted as heck and it won't allow you to experiment. But for new players it does open the game a little, though it won't go into specifics. Therefore it's better to play a few exhibition matches after you've done the tutorial.\nThe Exhibition matches are perfect for experimenting, because they don't have a persistent effect on your team. Work on your starting set-up and watch the AI closely. Here you get the goods on how teams are played, which is unvaluable information for the other game-modes. Many tactics the AI employs are also good to use by you.\nBegin a Campaign is a set mode where you buy the team of your choice (or field one of your existing teams) and try to reach the top of the different leagues and tournies.\nBegin a Competion is like the Campaign, but now you set it up to your specifications before you start play.\nStory Mode is very different as you're free-agent coach who coaches teams that need your expertise. This time, the focus is on you and your managerial skills. And you'll be tested. Hard.\nWorld Cup is like the wolfmother of Blood Bowl. Hear you must lead your team to greatness entering nothing but tournaments and your goal is to eventually qualify for the ultimate event.\nAll these modes can't be completed in a single evening. These modes are all in depth and content rich and successfully completing them will take your dedication and test your motivation.\n\nDon't go into this game believing that you'll trash it on your first match. Learn from the AI, see how it handles ball-possession and see how it defends. A wise man once said that no one ever learned something from winning and nowhere is this more true than in Blood Bowl.\n\n-Do safest actions first.\n-Do less safe actions second.\n-Do dangerous actions last.\n-Always guard your ballcarrier.\n-Buy re-rolls pre-game over stuff like Bribes and Bloodweiser Babes.\n-Cheerleaders and Coaches are the most helpful during kick-offs. Look for other things to buy first.\n-Use fouls and bribes to disable enemy keyplayers, like Catchers, Throwers and Runners. Don't waste them on rank and file.\n-Try to use all your re-rolls in a half, they get replenished at half-time. Re-rolls are instrumental to your play, so don't let them go to waste, use them as needed and don't be frugal with them thinking that you'll get a better chance to use them later.\n\nI love digital Blood Bowl, but the love took a wile to take hold. Blood Bowl rewards the patient, thinking player and it really opens up to those that stick with it and gain skill. Once you get past the disappointment of playing a game that won't let you win and start to recognize what works and what doesn't, Blood Bowl is one of the more rewarding games to play.\n\nFor those that want to always win and who want to be leet 24/7, Blood Bowl has little to offer.","August 16, 2014","true","21.9"," 309 of 361 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","309","361","3","16"

Turn based fantasy sport satire boardgame?\nIt's quite unique, and I have difficulty describing it in a simple way so I will explain the gameplay\n\nYou have a team of 11-16 pieces(Your players), and you face off against a team of similar size. Only up to 11 per team can be on the field at once. It is vaguely remniscent of American Football(Handegg for you Europeans out there), where you have a ball and you need to run it into your opposition's endzone to score. Different from the sport however is that you take turns moving your pieces.\nThis leads to a more strategic and tactical game, with the dice-based mechanics making it mainly a challenge of risk avoidance, while maximising the risk for your opponent.\n\nOf course, being a Warhammer universe, there are races other than humans. And everything is much more violent. It is not unusual for a team to have players die on the field, or to have them permanently injured. And tactics are much less throwing balls and passing for the less dextrous races(Orks tend to not have a great catcher for one, and the passing game of a dwarf team is notorious for being poor), and more other things. Stalling, outmanouvering your opponent, or just plainly trying to beat them all to a pulp and walk right through them are options. There are plenty of tactical choices to be made, and several strategic ones as well - A team can last you a very long time, and knowing how to build the skills on your team is crucial to your success in the later matches.\n\nIn the end, it is a very interesting game. It has a little something for everyone, from amazing comebacks out of a long pass by an elf team to the pure carnage of a band of orks having themselves a good old brawl while there just happens to be a ball in the mix somewhere, to entirely other playstyles entirely.\nWhile often I think of something to say that would let you know whether or not you'll like it, the only way to know for sure with Bloodbowl is to try.\n\nIt's very hit and miss.  If you end up enjoying it, you can get a long, long time out of your money. And if not, well. It was cheap(If you got it on sale), and you tried.\nAnd even then, it's a great game to play with a friend while just talking or doing something else on the side.\n\n\nBlood Bowl Chaos edition includes all content of Legendary edition.\n\nNew in Chaos edition are three new teams/races you can pick, none of them overpowered so you are not buying power here, while at the same time being 100% compatible with Legendary edition.\nThere are extra voice lines, a new stadium, and a new price tag!\nBuying Chaos edition gets you all the content in Legendary as well, so you can consider it the 'full edition' at this point. (Before Bloodbowl 2 anyway)\nIs it worth a whole 10 bucks more? Up to you. But do know that during sales it is often available for a much cheaper price, a total of 7,50 seems to be customary.\n\nWorth it on sale? You bet it is. Worth it for everyone? As before, maybe. But I do recommend giving it a try just in case you like it. Because if you do, you'll wonder where the hours went, and why the sun is coming up already.\n\n\nI highly recommend Cknoor and his group for both learning to play, finding the fun in the game if you're not sure on what to amuse yourself with, and finding people to play with\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/cknoorbowl","September 3, 2015","true","68.7"," 91 of 96 people (95%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","95","91","96","8","3"

But be warned:  it's hard, unforgiving, and frustrating as hell.\n\nA lot of people buy this game without having a background in wargaming type games, and they start thinking the RNG is broken.  I can understand that, because it can be frustrating to play well then get your ♥♥♥ kicked down the field because of bad dice rolls.  But that's how wargames are - you're making strategy based on the odds of the rolls.\n\nIf you can get that in your head, then you can start to learn the strategies - like doubling up on blocks to improve your odds.  Making use of the special skills of the various players.  Changing tactics against teams based on if they pass, brawl, etc.\n\nIt took me a good 12 hours to get the hang of it, and I've been playing wargames a long time.  I'm finally starting to win against the AI.  I played one online game, and they other player mopped the pitch with me, so I need a lot more practice.\n\nBut if you have the patience to develop the skills, you'll find this a lot of fun (even though it's very frustrating).  I also recommend looking for various online strategy guides that will help you with concepts / tactics like "The Cage", etc.  It reduces the learning curve and makes the game enjoyable sooner.","June 27, 2015","true","27.7"," 70 of 75 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","70","75","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rcthedigitalhero/recommended/216890/","rcthedigitalhero","Digital Hero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rcthedigitalhero/","647 products in account","This game falls in one of two categories: You will love it immensely, or you will hate it and wish you never played it.\n\nFor starters, it has a tremendously high learning curve. I've put my share of time in with both this and the legendary edition and I'm still learning new tactics. Couple that with every single team having their own specific playing style that you need to learn to a certain degree, and you have a death sentence for a new player that isn't patient enough to actually learn the ins and outs of the game.\n\nIf you can get passed that, it CAN be a tremendously fun game. There are few things more satisfying then a miracle touchdown play on the last turn of a game. It can also be so incredibly disheartening that you'll rage quit instantly. That is the nature of a game built around rolling dice though. Tragedy is around every corner.\n\nSo what is it? A sports game? Sort of. It's most accurately a competitive turn-based strategy game that isn't balanced. Some teams are specifically there for scoring and making exciting plays. Others are there to break those teams and kill as many players as possible. A third type is a gimmick sort of styled team that can be fun if you can work your way around their (potentially broken) achilles' heel.\n\nThere are 23 teams in total in this game, providing enough variety that if you feel like you're not enjoying the game, it could just be you're not playing the right team. For example, my favorite team to play is Lizards. They can bash with the best of them, but the skink ball carriers are more than capable of doing some miracle-esque types of plays that make things exciting. However, I can't stand playing with (or against for that matter) slower, more hit-aggressive teams like Orcs or Dwarves, as they don't bring as much of a high octane energy that I enjoy. The enjoyment this game brings you starts and ends with the teams you pick.\n\nI also recommend having a friend play this with you and not just jump into a league (public or private), as that will be good practice. It will also bring less of a feeling of angst when you start, as (hopefully) either they can help you learn OR you'll learn together.\n\nSo, all in all, it can be quite fun. I recommend it, but be warned this game is not easy to play, and can be emotionally crushing if you get invested in a team only to have your star players get killed by a blown dice roll.","December 9, 2013","true","224.7"," 69 of 78 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","69","78","0","0"

You'll need to be able to accept that your rolls will dictate your fate, that your best player, that you've built up with the best possible upgrades, can die at any time, and that even if you play with perfect strategy, some times you will fail anyway.

The variety of races, skills, and the fact that each team's playing style, potential and builds are truly unique and different, make it stand out.\nThe only fact that may discourage or frustrate players, is that luck may make or break a game of blood bowl. The game is intentionally made so, that anything can fail quite miserably, or succeed quite unexpectedly, if one is lucky enough. To some players this is intense and exciting, to others it is maddening and rage-inducing. Avoid, if you count yourself among the latter.\nIn general, it is one of the most interesting boardgaming experiences one may have.\n\nAs a pc game, it does have some advantages. It is pretty solid, and the multiplayer works excellently - it is relatively easy to find an opponent, and many times, even if one player loses connection momentarily, it succeeds in reconnecting. The community is usually friendly, and bad manners aren't that common.\nOn the negative side, everything other than the online multiplayer is laughably bad. The game doesn't feature any interactive way to teach you the rules of BB - of which there are many - and you have to learn them by reading the pdf rulebook. The single player campaign's AI is horribly bad; so bad, that playing vs AI has no value whatsoever, as the computer's moves are illogical, and the team builds it uses are unorthodox and usually worthless. Blitz mode is amazingly awful and doesn't deserve looking at.\n\nConcludingly, I would say, BUY THIS GAME.\nBut only if you are fully aware what you're getting into: a deep, complex, multiplayer strategy boardgame with a steep learning curve. Oh, and visit bbtactics.com, it will make starting up a lot easier. Good luck, have fun.","November 27, 2013","true","289.7"," 24 of 28 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","24","28","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Owlakki/recommended/216890/","Owlakki","Owlakki™ 5 days til birthday","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Owlakki/","441 products in account","Blood Bowl is an adaptation of a tabletop game by the same name that was created by Games Workshop. It takes place in an alternate version of the Warhammer Fantasy universe where all of the races decide to settle their differences playing games of American Gridiron Football.\n\nMuch of the aesthetic of Blood Bowl was nailed perfectly. The look of the more general races like the Humans resemble 1950's caricatures of Football players. While the more fantastical races like the Undead look like mummified quarterbacks. There's a significant amount of content in this release, with a total of 23 races. Each with their own unique roster of players and distinctive gameplay balance.\n\nMy favorite aspect of Blood Bowl is it's extensive singleplayer experience that also appears in the multiplayer. If your players get injured this carries over into subsequent matches, and if they die you lose them forever. Your players also level up and gain Fallout style perks. It reminds me a great deal of strategy games like X-Com. The entire game is turn based and every action in the game is determined through rolling a 6 sided die. It is a surprisingly faithful recreation of the original tabletop game, which puts off a lot of players as a result.\n\nBlood Bowl gets frequently referred to as an "RNG game with a mix of strategic elements". Which I personally disagree with. The random elements to the game make the game stand out to me compared to a lot of other strategy games. Where you can have a player void his entire turn because of a botched pass, forcing you to adapt. The meta of the game as a result revolves around minimizing the amount of rolls you might have to make, taking full advantage of your teams strengths. Because of these random elements, succeeding with a plan feels much more earned than it normally would be in any other strategy game. You feel that Ork score a touchdown, you feel your team win a tournament. It all feels really good when you win.\n\nWhich brings me to my criticisms of the game. While Cyanide did a hell of a job adapting the rules, the game doesn't really explain very core fundamentals. Things like the balance between the races, roster selection, and even what particular plays are more effective over others. Blood Bowl is a game that requires practice and most importantly patience. You won't fully learn the game without losing several matches and clocking in upwards of 10 hours into it even. It takes a lot of reading guides and practice to really understand how to play it.\n\nBut that's one of the most satisfying aspects of Blood Bowl. To me it's a turn based strategy game that's willing to anger you, that's willing to grind your teeth, that's willing to paint facepaint on your cheeks and dump Gatorade down your throat. This game is one of the finer examples of injecting variety into an otherwise bland sports game, and it really makes you feel like you're playing it in both body and mind.\n\nOne last thing to note is the "Chaos" edition to the game is the complete version, with more content than the Legendary edition. While you can play online with players from the Legendary edition, it comes highly recommended to get this version to recieve the full experience.","November 4, 2015","true","6.0"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","20","22","0","1"

Although the game generally works very well, it's much more enjoyable when you sit yourself down to the actual rules. It's a little bit of work, but these rules were honed through years of playtesting and active experience and what has come out makes sure that every game is exciting, unpredictable and challenging. Above all it's a game that teaches one to learn to deal with the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ situations you can be put in or marvel at the gutsy gambles that have paid off.\n\nNot recommended for people that dislike chance as a whole; you can minimize the risk to a great amount and the winner of league is generally the better player, but the winner of a match is sometimes decided by the dice gods.\n\nMy very first game my most expensive player was hit and killed by a rock thrown by the audience; before I had even made a single decision.

It's based on a somewhat high level table top board game and plays out like one in video game form.  Blood Bowl is a game of incredible depth and takes a serious amount of time to learn to do it well.  But if you do take that time and understand that this game is all about managing risk, you'll find it very rewarding in a reasonable amount of time.\n\nWhile it might seem like a relaxing sit-back-and-click type take on the sports genre, it's rather tense.  Building your own teams, naming the players, and leveling them up has you second and third guessing each decision.  These players become extensions of you to a point, and risking them can be difficult!  The emotional and strategic depth in this game is unlike anything I've experienced.  I can't reccomend it enough for fans of table top board games or fans who might be into a sports/rpg hybrid.\n\nI had played Blood Bowl 2 on the consoles first, which gives you a pretty good understanding of the rules and the risks involved.  This version is much more complete, with many more races to choose from than BB2. Like more than twice more.  The graphics aren't as good but this game runs well even on my old beatup laptop.  And it doesn't look bad.  The controls and interface is fantastic as I always feel like I'm making the move I want to make.\n\nI know some of the negative reviews seem to be people who had frustrating dice rolls.  I promise that this game was never meant to be that hard.  It's supposed to be a deep table top board game at it's core, but it's not supposed require hours and hours of research before playing.  You will fail, but as long as you can understand why you fail in a rather short time you'll learn the rules pretty quickly.  I'm not the biggest fan of table top games in the world and I managed to learn the rules.\n\nPro tip: If you want additional resources theres a YouTuber named cKnoor who has excellent beginner and intermediate level strategy videos.

Blood and limbs flying as teams of heavily armed and armored individuals try to move the ball down the field.\n\nThe game has a handful of different modes where you can make a team take them through competitions. It also supports exporting the team you create to use in exhibition matches. Where this game shines, however, is online play. Get a group of friends together and start a league. Revel as your chainsaw wielding goblin takes out that annoying guy from chemistry's reciever. Laughs will be had, tears will be shed, and there is a good chance someone will die on the field.\n\nThat's Blood Bowl.","January 30, 2014","true","64.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Though it does an adequate job of teaching the mechanics of the game, you're mostly left on your own to figure out the best ways to make use of those mechanics. You should look up fansites to read up on some effective tactical doctrines if you don't feel like learning through trial-and-error. Fortunately, they're easy to find.\n-Missing some of the races from the current version of the tabletop rules, as well as a large number of Star Players (special players you can hire to play for your team for one game only, usually as part of the inducement system).\n\nTHE MIXED\n*Only marginal in terms of balance. There's a great amount of customization that lets you remain competitive, but there are some skills that are just flat-out better than others, and some races that have intrinsic advantages over others.\n*There's in-game announcing, fitting with its sports theme, but limited variety means you'll be hearing the same things over and over before long. Still, I like hearing the announcers, because they give some amusing anecdotes from and comments on the universe's rich fluff and history.\n*The game sticks rather faithfully to the tabletop rules, which means many things from success or failure on the field to a degree of player progression are determined by dice rolls. This can be alternatingly thrilling and frustrating, and although the random aspects aren't enough to negate skill, it's important to remember that nothing is ever certain in Blood Bowl.\n*Player turnover. Some people like constantly raising new players, while others may be upset when their star player dies. Don't get too attached to your players, because the game is called Blood Bowl for a reason.\n*The sheer number of player skills, while good in the long run, can be a bit overwhelming at first until you've managed to memorize what they all do and how to take advantage of them.\n*The many different races, while each offering unique roster possibilities, tend to fall broadly into variations of 2-4 general playstyles rather than each offering truly unique gameplay opportunities.\n\nCONCLUSION\nIf you like turn-based strategy games, this is an easy recommendation. If you like turn-based strategy games, bloody carnage, and a rich, amusing setting, this is a must-have.","December 28, 2012","true","56.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

And it technically still is. Blood Bowl is a great game. The underlying mechanics are great, and Chaos Edition was, even with the release of BB2, the definitive edition of the game.\n\nKeyword was. With the release of BB2 we saw a slow downward spiral of the MP community, to the point where today, the only action going on in BB1, either CE or Legendary, is in scheduled organized leagues. As such I cannot reccomend BB1 to a new player. BB2 may be a steep ask what with the lesser amount of teams, but it's where most of the pickup MP community has gone. There also is the freeware alternative called FUMBBL, that's 2d and java based. Both are a far better option than BB1 now for actual MP.\n\nOrdinarily I would not go an remove and change the thumb to a down for a game simply because of the MP community drying up, but for Blood Bowl the entirety of the game is both MP, and has moved on to a nearly identical platform as well at that, and thus I feel obliged to steer people to those two alternatives, either the updated retail version, or the smaller, more hardcore community of the freeware game.","June 3","false","119.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

If you like strategy games then this is certainly for you. It is also a game for you if you enjoy killing people. The dice-based system is... Well... Dicey, but that is to be expected (TRIPLE 1!) and is how the game should be when dice-based, makes you happy when you roll good but sad when you roll bad.. The offline play is ok, and the games are faster than online, but the ai is extra limited compared to a human mind, and it is always more rewarding to go against a real human. The gameplay works well but Cyanide have made some things... Cyanide... But overall a great game and I recommend it fully. Also, Halfings may be the best team ever if you play.

Every time I start describing the experience of carefully selecting a team, training them, picking a sponsor and selecting your per-game bribes people get excited.  Then people hear that in every match there's a chance that your entire team will be injured or killed after gaining valuable experience points.  People's eyes tend to glaze over at this point.\n\nIt's the violence and death that make the multiplayer and campaign so good.  You know that every match will be brutal and chance as much as skill will turn the tide of victory.  Seeing the crowd turn on your opponent to tear them to shreds on a bad play or watching your own blocker critically fail a roll and bounce off the other teams ball carrier like the dude is made of force fields are just flipsides of the same coin.\n\nYou can be good at this game or bad.  Awesome or terrible.  In the end this game is like all true Games Workshop titles.  Skill is irrelevant.  The fun is in the stories you get to tell later about the crazy stuff that happened on the dice rolls and how they played out.  Play it with friends or enemies or the exceptionally active Blood Bowl community on Steam if you like, but understand that winning and losing aren't super important.

It's an interesting game, but you have to be prepared for failure as the odds are amost always in favor of failing... But that's how Game's Workshop games are. To properly enjoy the game you have to accept that you might lose or that a play won't go favorably. It's definitely a game about minimizing your chances at failing, it's part of the strategy and you can use it against your opponents.\n\nPersonally, I like playing the Ogre team. They don't seem like a serious team, but fielding 6 big guys really puts the hurt on the enemy team.

If you like American football with slightly less violence, this game is a lot of fun. Strategy reigns supreme, you need to learn the strengths and weaknesses of the various teams and take advantage of them. For example, the Elve teams tend to be great at running and throwing the ball, able to easily and quickly score touchdowns if allowed to remain on their feet, while races like the Dwarves take the slow and steady approach to (literally) steamrolling enemy teams as they make a group push towards the end zone. Killing the enemy team outright is a viable option and some races such as Chaos and the Orcs depend on incapacitating the enemy team to make up for a lack of a strong passing or high defenses like the Dwarves.\n\nThe dice gods, as always in Games Workshop properties, ultimately reign supreme in Blood Bowl. The best laid plans can still go all wrong, and that is part of the fun because it will happen to your opponents as often as it happens to you. There ARE steps you can take to minimize the impact of the random number generator though, in the form of bribes to the referees, wizards in the audience, etc... In terms of game modes you have a full season Campaign, in which the goal is to win enough regulation games to take part in large tournaments. Over the course of this mode you will draft new players and watch existing ones become better at the game, managing team finances and the players in a meta-game in between actual matches. Also ready for your enjoyment are one-shot tournaments organized by yourself in Competition mode, one-shot games called Exhibition Matches, a Tutorial for new players, and a Story Mode which has you playing with various famous teams over the course of a career as a coach. Lots to do, for sure, and if you like multiplayer there are still many active players online in the matchmaking service. Even if there wasn't though, you could still play over LAN using Hamachi or local hotseat.\n\nOverall I do recommend the game, and I hope when Blood Bowl 2[www.bloodbowl-game.com] comes out they attempt to keep it contained to fewer iterations. I doubt they will though based on the last run... The good news is that Chaos Edition is the final version of this run, so if you see it on sale and you like turn based strategy games with a lot of over-the-top sports humor thrown in, you can't go wrong with Chaos Edition. It feature local hot seat play, so even if people stop playing it online you can still play it with your friends in your own home a lot cheaper than you could by buying the actual board game.","December 26, 2013","true","0.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

When the Chaos edition went on sale for £5, I spent a while trying to decide whether it was worth the gamble, and it turns out it was.\n\nFirst things first, it's important to note that this is a dice-based game, so there are going to be stretches where you get a run of bad rolls and lose to teams you should beat, players die from tripping over their own feet and falling over, and you can't pass the ball three yards under no pressure whatsoever.\nOnce you're past the luck-based side of things, this is a pretty faithful rendition of the Blood Bowl boardgame, albeit without the need for a mountain of paper and three hours to finish a match.\nEach side has their own strengths and weaknesses (although team balance is a little screwy - there's not much reason to choose outside of 5 or so teams of the 20+ available, that's Games Workshop's error, not Cyanide who developed the videogame version), and there should be a side to suit most playstyles, from 'pass it around' to 'kill the other guys, we'll worry about the ball later'.\n\nOverall, it's not going to blow anyone away, but if you're looking for a nice sports game with a twist, or you like the concept of Blood Bowl but don't have/want to spend all afternoon shuffling bits of paper, this could be a good buy.","September 27, 2013","true","97.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Players can level up and you can select skills or stat boosts - theres actually somewhat many but level ups are slow and a few skills are absolutely essential for the role a player is supposed to fill so youll prolly always wanna chose those.\n\nTheres a "Blitz" mode which has some more stuff along the same lines along with buying equipment which is expensive, temporary and on top of that provides benefits only at a random chance around 20%  and in classic mode the player would gain the visual upgrade on a level up (without the bonus, not sure). Also you have to chose a sponsor and if you dont fullfill certain criteria they take all your money at the end of a season because thats how this works (?!?). Play classic.\n\nTheres "live" commentary which inevitably gets old after a while.\n\nStill a very fun game despite or more likely because of the random element..oh heh RNG dicked you over again.

It is a hardcore strategy: it's unforgiving, ugly, and you do need to learn quite a lot. Yes, the graphics aren't that great, yes, there is a big randomness factor for a hardcore turn based strategy, and yes, some races are extremly below the curve. But man, this game is rewarding as hell.\n\nOnce you get to the point, where you undestand basci tactics, and concepts, you can start playing the really interesting teams. The game itself has an incredible variety just from the tactics available. Add the 25 race, the leveling system, for each player individually, multi player, tournaments, single player campaign, and you can easily put in 100 hours into this game, if you ever get bored.\n\nIf you don't have any other Blood Bowl game, I recommend starting here. Buying the 2nd, is a waste of money, that game doesn't deserve to be called Blood Bowl. Buying the Legendary and saving 10 euros is something, but the three races are well worth it, believe me.\n\nFor learning, I recommend cKnoor's youtube channel, he made some tutorials for beginners, and has a lot of gameplay uploaded, you can learn a lot from him. He also streams on twitch, if I remember right.\n\nIf you need help with starting the game, I am more then happy to teach you the basics of the game, and some of the more beginner friendly races. So feel free to write me a p.m., but don't expect me up anytime soon, I have a social life to live after all, I can't spend every minute hitting people into the ground with a team of mummies and skeletons :DD","December 12, 2015","true","45.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Which is completely fine for what is it. A smash with your lizard jaws your opponent's team or deftly dodge the grubb dwarf hands game.You manage a team and lead them to glory in two campaign modes, your typical single player experience or the be-kidnapped-by-teams/play-as-coach-basis, with the former having two modes in themselves which limits your time limit or lets you have a more leisurely pace. The AI in this game isn't great, which is why the true game lies in not the game itself but the human players. Tournaments are great avenues of fun.\n\nPros & Cons\n\nPros:\nThis game for its time and the general anesthetic of the game has great graphics. The players are detailed enough and the brawls are great fun to watch but albeit it all gets stale when you watch if for the 100th hour. Doesn't all repetitive motion get like that? You shouldn't be paying that close attention to detail when you are praying for your dice throw however.\n\nCons:\nThis game...has a steep learning curve the size of Mt. Everest. This is taking it kindly. My recommendation is to not play or at least don't get comfortable with the game AI. It teaches you bad habits, and takes stupid risks to fullfill your ego, which paradoxically due to the way the AI cheats medium is the easiest difficulty. Or at least those stupid moves to be ego increasing for the sole purpose to later realize it was all a lie in multiplayer. The game is essentially a giant game of risk management with your dice and your players. To which humans seem alot more intuitive at, than AI so far.\n\nOverall, if you have patience, and enjoy a management game that is more dice rolling and strategic chess with a side of gore. This is your game.\n\n","November 4, 2014","true","34.9"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

Which is completely fine for what is it. A smash with your lizard jaws your opponent's team or deftly dodge the grubb dwarf hands game.You manage a team and lead them to glory in two campaign modes, your typical single player experience or the be-kidnapped-by-teams/play-as-coach-basis, with the former having two modes in themselves which limits your time limit or lets you have a more leisurely pace. The AI in this game isn't great, which is why the true game lies in not the game itself but the human players. Tournaments are great avenues of fun.\n\nPros & Cons\n\nPros:\nThis game for its time and the general anesthetic of the game has great graphics. The players are detailed enough and the brawls are great fun to watch but albeit it all gets stale when you watch if for the 100th hour. Doesn't all repetitive motion get like that? You shouldn't be paying that close attention to detail when you are praying for your dice throw however.\n\nCons:\nThis game...has a steep learning curve the size of Mt. Everest. This is taking it kindly. My recommendation is to not play or at least don't get comfortable with the game AI. It teaches you bad habits, and takes stupid risks to fullfill your ego, which paradoxically due to the way the AI cheats medium is the easiest difficulty. Or at least those stupid moves to be ego increasing for the sole purpose to later realize it was all a lie in multiplayer. The game is essentially a giant game of risk management with your dice and your players. To which humans seem alot more intuitive at, than AI so far.\n\nOverall, if you have patience, and enjoy a management game that is more dice rolling and strategic chess with a side of gore. This is your game.\n\n","November 4, 2014","true","34.9"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

It is, however, arguably the best way to play the board game Blood Bowl over the internet.  Fumbbl, while a wonderful community, is built around an application that experiences server-wide glitches between patches that affect the meta of entire leagues.  I respect people who play on fumbbl, and in many ways prefer the simple sprite-based interface.  However, Chaos Edition includes a tutorial and single player modes to ease new players into the game.\n\nFor a time, I refused to purchase any version of Cyanide's Blood Bowl after the barebones 2009 version.

What Games Workshop has left is arbitrary dice rolling, which has even been dilluted to the point where the player cannot see the dice unless certain circumstances apply, and long waits for opponents.\nIf one is looking for an initial indicator of game quality, the tutorial is usually an excellent place to start. Blood Bowl takes enough time to get in a little of the flavor of the world in which it is built, but decides to leave out little details like rules beyond the basics one might expect from a primer on American Football for 3 year olds, (Ball goes in the end zone, tackling players good, getting injured bad) while blatantly telling the player that if they want to know more, they should look it up.\nOne might accept that story mode is in fact the true tutorial, since the first mission is simply to finish a game, regardless of win or loss, as though testing a players patience for the slow, laborious plodding of the computer. While the second mission is to throw 2 goblins, with no instructions on how to do so. It becomes more frustrating once you find out how to do so, since in order to accomplish this seemingly simple task, a player must actually overcome 2 phantom dice rolls in addition to simply having the necessary pieces available.\nUltimately Blood Bowl takes what promised to be an exciting, comedic romp through a well established and lore filled world, and turn it into a distillation of the worst elements of a table top miniatures game with poor camera angles and repetetive dialouge.","October 13, 2014","false","1.7"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

I think one thing you have to bear in mind with this game at all times is that this is a literal copy of the games rules, so the core mechanic is a 6 sided dice, which are known for being fickle things, and can lead to some very frustration rolls and outcomes (4 1's "attacking player falls" in a row is my personal record.\n\nOne critisism i think goes without saying for this game is the commentery.

You will NOT be playing FOOTBALL. If you were expecting action like the old NFL Bltiz then keep on moving. This is a turn based football game. I'm sure its an excellent recreation of the board game, but they cleverly hide that fact in the video and descriptions. In fact, the only place you can discover that its a board game is in the "popular user-defined tags". I believe this was intentional because who actually wants to play a turn based football boardgame on the PC.\n\nMaybe, just maybe, I could see this being fun on a table top with minitures. But even then, the rules defined to make this game work just dont meet my expectation for a fun, exciting sporting event.\n\nThis game is just a big NO from me. If you've played the board game, and enjoyed it, i'm sure this is a fine recreation. If you want a football game to be 1 character performing actions to dice rolls based on static positioning, then you may enjoy this game too.

It wins a recommendation because of the diversity of teams in the Chaos Edition, the amusing (for a while, see below) commentary, and the satisfaction you gain from winning.\nHaving never played the tabletop game it is based on I cannot speak on this aspect.\nHowever, the negatives I have make this a VERY BORDERLINE RECOMMENDATION. Most everything is won or lost on random dice rolls. The sheer probability balancing and number crunching involved in a truly deep strategy is more than I can be bothered to spend on such a game which still seems largely arbitrary. If you are anything like me you will end up save scumming matches that are especially important. Also, you are liable to end up cursing your time loudly and terribly as they appear to be the most inept incompetent sports players EVER, worse than England football teams in recent World Cup tournaments. Watch as these supposedly trained players, who should have more skill than a comatose amoeba even at the most basic levels, fails at such a simple task as picking up the ball. Which is a Turnover. Fails to catch a pass from a foot away. Turnover. Fails to quite run the distance without stacking it. Turnover. Even I am not that clumsy, and in the end you may well either rage quit or eventually develop a complete loathing and sarcastic relationship of hate with your team.\nI play it occasionally, when the idea appeals and trumps my memories of actual gameplay. As a concept, it is great. As an experience it is stressful and lacking. I recommend it tentatively because I have enjoyed it on occasion, and you might too.","May 16, 2015","true","25.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

But online every single game devolves into the same cycle of Chaos, Dwarves, Chaos, Chaos, or some other brute team which can simply cripple your players and eke out a win... or a few people abusing the Matchmaking by having 5 or so L6 players hidden amongst some throwaway L1s, and then use the overpowered skills stacked on the individuals to humiliate you.\n\nThose masses of positive reviews? They're from people who really don't care about the community, but will do what ever they want online and damn what it feels like to you to try and play for fun; they're the people still here years down the line that didn't care the game never took off, because they're in it for the shallow ego boost that comes from using an easy team to win match after match. Seriously, the game designed teams as Easy and Hard difficulty and then suffocates under finding literal easy mode teams in match after match after match...\n\nI'm told Blood Bowl 2 rebalanced the teams to make them a bit more equal?

Clicking on any player during kick off breaks your ability to swap substitutes out. Players can simply sit on the Intercept roll if you throw the ball and they have a chance to catch it, and force your entire timer to run down. And it's hard to escape the suspicion that people have individual RNG seeds, with some being much worse than others, when you run into bad luck game after game... someone even went as far as telling me my dice were cursed the other day. It's possibly not true, but in a game SO luck dependent, if you're the sort of person who isn't going to abuse the rules for quick overpower, and finds it frustrating to see your strategy fail because someone else did, or the dice went against you, this game will be absolute torture to you.\n\nI've installed it twice now, and it kills me every time because of that. I end up seething at people being gits because the rules allow it, and you can't stop them, and I can't even have fun with my own team.

If you're still with me after that little description, then maybe Blood Bowl is for you.\n\nYou start the game by selecting a team of bloodthirsty monsters from the Warhammer universe. Each race plays a little differently. The Orcs want to bash their opponents into the dirt. The Elves want to dodge around and make big passing plays. The Goblins have a bunch of dirty tricks up their sleeves. You choose your name, logo and colour and then you begin.\n\nThe first time I played, I got completely thrashed by the computer. There is a learning curve present but there are plenty of guides online and a big community of players who can give you some pointers. Leveling up your guys in the right way is a big part of the game. Some skills like Block and Dodge are a must, other skills like Pass block are only used in specific circumstances and best saved for later.\n\nThe sound is satisfying. The commentators are hilarious. I though the graphics were fine. It's an older game from a smaller studio, so I wasn't expecting much. There is a nice variety of units in the game. The Chaos Edition comes with 23 teams and there is plenty of single player content here to play around with if you want to avoid the highly competitive online scene. Some guys have been playing the board game since the 80s and will mop the floor with newer players.\n\nI'm loving Blood Bowl so far. Anyways, I've got to get back to trying to take my team "The New Ork Ragerz" to the Blood Bowl final.","January 8","true","86.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Blood Bowl is a combination of a tactical and sports game developed by Cyanide Studios and published by Focus Home Interactive. The basics are extremely simple: two teams, one ball. The team that carries the ball into the opponent's end zone scores a touchdown, the team with the most touchdowns at the end of the game is the winner. However, it’s how you decide to do this that makes things interesting, the ends justify the means! It’s not just the players you have at your disposal either. You can bribe the referee to look the other way as you cripple or trample annoying opponents and hire illegal wizards to give you a hand directly from the crowd… Blood Bowl severely tests the finest tacticians' strategies.\n\nNow, does the game deliver? At first, I was totally skeptical on recieving a tactical sports game, which I had never experienced before playing Blood Bowl, because I had never played one. Fortunately, it's a great game and delivers on the spot. The game is very fun to play as you use your players to travel to the end zone and hopefully not get squashed by the other team. And, you will be squashed, even through your diligent efforts. No matter what difficulty, you will experience challenges including turnovers, bribed referees (which is hilarious), and wizards deciding to mess up your good play.\nThe graphics in this game are...well...it was published in 2010, so you know what I mean. Even though it was published in '10, the graphics are still solid. It is nice to see some gigantic orcs facing the puny humans in a standoff, with some great textures. Even using low settings during the game, the textures function well as well as character models, which is great to see from a game as we don't see it much anymore.\n\nHow about controls and fluency? The controls are very easy to learn, once again thanks to the tutorial. Also, if you play strategy games, you should recognize controls right away because they're fairly simple to learn. The game is also very fluent with everything going on. The textures of the stadium and with the crowd, are pleasing. The AI is excellent and will 95% match whatever skill you're at, whether it's easy, medium, or hard, some mode will challenge you.\nThis game will mainly interest either sports or strategy fans the most, but that doesn't mean it isn't for you, because it's a great game for everyone. It's tutorial is great in everyway and I wish more game developers as were creative and descriptive, as Cyanide Studios was, with tutorials. There has been a sequel announced to Blood Bowl called Blood Bowl II, but there hasn't been much information leaked to the public. If you're interested in purchasing Blood Bowl, there are two packages you can choose from on Steam: Legendary and Chaos Edition. Legendary Edition costs $19.99 and Chaos Edition costs $29.99. Both are great, but the Chaos Edition (which I tried out), is more preferred so you get the full game and MORE that will only give you hours of more blood!\n\nFinal Verdict: 8.5/10 - Bloody hell!","May 18, 2014","true","0.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

It is actually with a very heavy heart that I can actually give it a thumbs down. I am torn and seriously torn at this. I have had a lot of great moments, but a lot of bad moments as well. The problem with this game is in its entire appeal to RNJesus. If you love dice rolling games with a twist of strategy, then this is for you. If you are a diehard strategy nerd, then this game will leave you bitter when the opposing team kills 2 of your star players and then procedes to dodge the rest of your team into a touch down after 3 turns of you rolling 2 attacker downs.\n\nThe temple of RNG is that of a 6 sided die where 1s are always failures and 6s are always successes. You can stack it in your favor where 2-6 is a success or a 6 is the only success, but you must realize that means there is always a possibility of 17% failure. To me, this is the deal breaker. This to me, breaks the game. This is akin to munchkin(a fine game in certain lights) which can be fun light-heartedly, but if I were to rank this game amongst other strategy games, it has to get the thumbs down.\n\nThis game does have many strategic aspects and so I thoroughly enjoy it for a Saturday sitdown, but the mental engagement is severally lacking. You can even tell since the AIs only ability to perform better is through just giving it more perks than you. This always leaves a fairly sour taste in my mouth, but I can usualy power through it if the game plays if engaging enough. This game play isn't.\n\nSo for the TLDR crowd, if you want an RNG game that mimicks strategy, get this game. If you actually like strategy games, then this game is a no for me.","November 2, 2015","false","14.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","1"

But this nonsense is suspicious.\n\nEvery time I get close to winning a match, on easy mind you, things start to go spastic. For example, 0-0 and in the second half, RNG going my way then the AI's, then back again, etc. With the ball two squares from the line, all of a sudden things take a turn for the worse! An enemy zombie is able to go through three red spots, THREE! and picks up the ball. My counter attack with a troll next turn resulted in nothing but red skulls, and for the next three turns in a row, my various counterattacks against said zombie, all resulted in red skulls. Every. Single. One. Even my re-roll. Once the zombie passed the ball to something else and scored, miraculously RNG went normal again, but by then it was too late.\n\nAnother good example was that one other time I almost won a match on easy. I made the decision to make a roll for an extra square, given that extra square would put me in the try zone. but failed and fell over. Fair enough, that's RNG. For the next three turns however, my high-agility skaven with extra hands and 2+ chance to pick up, fumbled the ball. In those three turns, two human players were well within reach to blitz me, or even move up to block my movement. But they just stood there watching my skaven suddenly become as nifty as a drunken troll's fart.\n\nAll-in-all, this game would be amazing if it wasn't so blatantly bull even on easy.

Do you like fantasy creatures? Well, Blood Bowl combines all three of these things (dice from gambling, a ruleset based on American football, and teams of creatures from the fantasy Warhammer universe) and turns it into a board game. Blood Bowl Chaos Edition is the most complete digital version of the Blood Bowl board game to date.\nAlmost all of the dice rolling is hidden from the player (unless the player chooses to see it), leaving the player with only the fun choices: what team to play, and then who will be on that team and how they will play. The only dice you'll have to "touch" (ie, interact with), are the block dice, which randomly offer you a set number of possible outcomes of unit vs unit interactions based on the strength values of your units (you should really look up the mechanics of Blood Bowl if you want specifics; they're too in depth for me to go into here).\nHowever, dice rolling is central to Blood Bowl, so even if you try to ignore it, it will always be there. And, between random events like where the fans come on to the field and knock out half your players and the inevitable moment when one of your players dies, there will be nothing you can do about it. No matter how great your tactical planning or how immense your foe appears, a single dice roll can turn the tide and usually does...in theory.\nThere are "bad" teams, meaning you will have a lot of problems if you chose them, and will likely lose. Even if you find a decent team that you want to play, you may have to work harder than you'd expect to play they how they're "supposed" to be played. There's a "cheating" system that will give you money if you go up agianst higher ranked teams, but there will often be times when the cheats you can afford are simply not good enough. If one of your players gets injured and is forced to miss the next game, you'll be stuck with a mercinary that is always worse than the player it replaces thatnks to a trait called "Loner." If one of your players dies, it's gone forever.\nAll of this culminates in a game that feels extremely punishing when you lose and is easy to become addicted to. You may have fun with it, but in my hours of play I rarely did. The dice rolling sucked away over 20 hours of my life, and it wasn't worth it. Avoid unless you love chance-based games.","April 13, 2014","false","34.1"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","3","11","0","0"

However I can't really recommend it based on it's history.\n\nLet me explain. Originally Cyanide produced a game called Chaos League (with an expansion called Sudden Death) which was a direct take off of Bloodbowl the board game. After a big legal dispute with games workshop they ended up developing Bloodbowl the computer game.\n\nThe trouble is that I don't think this is an improvement on Chaos League. It's biggest advantage is that you can play it online. However otherwise it's not an improvement and in some regards is worse. Personally I think Chaos League is more fun.\n\nWhere it falls down in comparison to Chaos League is the dice rolls.  Unlike the boardgame version the dice rolls that the AI makes are suspiciously unrandom. e.g. There should be a 1-6 chance of a fumbled throw but my experience of this was far more frequent (6 times in a row once), the AI rarely fails it's dodge rolls etc and simply put the die rolls often don't seem random, certainly I've never seen dice come up with the same results so often in real life.\n\nTo my mind another advantage of chaos league is you have the option to play a real time option which you can pause (Which personally I prefer) which allows you to plan your moves and is useful if you want to stop mid-game for any reason. Games also last longer and don't have half time, so no irritating half time whistle just when you were about to score.\n\nChaos League also has the option to buy and develop star players for each race, which are a lot of fun. But you don't get them in Bloodbowl, I also prefer some elements of the layout in Chaos league and some of the little touches such as when a player is killed a little tombstone appears on the pitch and the players spirit is seen departing into the ether. There are a few minor tweaks and improvements in Bloodbowlbut not enough to make it a better game.\n\nOverall if you want to play against friends I'd say buy the board game. If you want to play against the computer I'd buy Chaos league (Sudden death edition) it's simply more fun and you won't find yourself swearing at the compurter as much. If you want a strategy game buy football manager. I'd only buy this if you intend to play online.","November 11, 2014","false","105.9"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","0"

Alot of other fanboys will just say  that I am bad or don't understand the game, however, I do get that the game is extreamly in depth and like that aspect, it is why I purchased it in the first place. With that fanboy garb set aside, really looking at the game there are tons of issues for new players and people who just want to have fun, not have to rage about cheap and unfair AI. The AI's dice rolls being rigged are the most frustrating part of the game bar none. If not for these rigged single player settings the game could be real fun. I have no problem with RNG in games in fact I love that aspect, however, this is not the case here. Yet again alot of fanboys and other will continuiously state that it is not rigged, that people just dont understand the brutality of RNG and statistics. but, I do thats the problem, and thats why I know that the game is rigged. In conclusion I would rate this game a 2 out of 10, some people may like the way the game AI cheats, but I think most casual gamers playing on easy just want to enjoy their experience when playing. If I wanted unfair and imbalanced AI I would play on hard setting, Overall, I got this game on sale for 75% off so you would think I cant really complain... but I just got my refund. So if your going to spend any money at all on this title I would suggest doing some research first. You will find I'm not alone in my review.

A real time option - why on earth spend time on that - when half the races was missing? The answer is noone would have paid for that as an extra (like they made us pay for basic races).\n\n\nThe problem for me is the statistics and the ingame community features are boring and you do not get a feeling of being part of af huge community.\n\n(at least the spectate option is there now)\n\nThere is alot of games where you play someone that obviously has no idea what he/she is doing. It ends up in an extremely onesided match - where more often than not the new player gets either mad and uses profanity or just leaves the game on - for you to wait for the timeout every turn.\n\nThe other problem is the huge percentage of games where the opponent just quit (without any significant penalty).\n\nThe game also had an weird priority in which races should be availeble first - but that is history now.\n\nI love Blood Bowl in all forms - so I really hope they overhall the commynitypart of the game - and creates something like divisions for coaches. So everybody has to play XXX amout of games in "the college divisions" before moving to the "NFL".\n\nThat would give everybody a better experiance - the new coaches would not be preyed upon - and it should result in a higher percentage of close matches.\n\nBlood Bowl is one of the best boardgames around - and this is becoming better and better - but there is still someway to go.\n\nIt is the best around (actually pretty much the only option around now that fumbbl more or less died) - but there are a huge amount of work to do for Cyanide to UP the community.","December 26, 2014","false","91.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Sure you have your games like Fifa, NFL, and such but I'm a huge fan of Warhammer.\nI found it far too satisfying to make a Goblin sized hole in the ground, under the foot of my Kroxigor, break the opposing teams line of defense with a wall of Saurus and slip a nimble Skink, who just pinched the ball from said pool-of-guts-goblin, through the wall and on his fair way to the touchdown line to be, himself, gored on a minotaur horn and kicked the opposite direction.

This is an excellent duplication of that game.\n\nYou can't judge it against modern computer games, because those try to keep everybody happy. Blood Bowl may break up friendships, set brother against brother, sister against sister and generally ♥♥♥♥ off everybody at some point in time. Because it honestly does not care about your feelings. And that's why you know it's a true to life replication of the original Blood Bowl experience.\n\nIf you think the game is cheating to beat you, you haven't paid attention to the odds. The RNG is not broken. I've seen people smash real world dice with a hammer, or melt them into puddles, for rolling triple skulls, TWICE in a row. Do not imagine that it's impossible for the computer to roll the exact same way on that game winning play.\n\nA lot of people say that the game is bugged. I've watched a lot of games on YouTube where somebody has blamed a bug for a play not going the way it's supposed to (in their head) or for the "wrong" dice being rolled. Haven't seen one yet where that person didn't just miss one of the rules, or spot the goblin marking their treeman, ruining the assist for that ever so crucial extra die on a block.\n\nLike the original game, there are problems. Team progression (trying to build them up, whilst minimising damage costs and replacement players) can be very difficult to manage, sometimes not even worth it. But that's not the real fun of the game. The real fun is in taking on your friends in blood-thirsty combat and beating them with a humiliating three point lead. It's in screaming that "DWARVES IS CHEATING!" and your opponent smiling and saying, "yes. Dwarves is," and then proceeding to wipe the field with your squishy elf team.\n\nIt's a game of playing the odds and knowing that even when you DO play the odds, they're only odds, not certainties.\n\nAnd if you ever anger Nuffle, RNGsus help you.","October 11, 2014","true","27.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you turn away for a moment and look back, you could be expected to make a timed decision, but the game will not tell you what kind of decision you are supposed to be making.  The training system is a complete disaster: First, there is nothing to tell you to click the stop button, second, the UI is employed as a device to keep you from attempting a re-roll without using control-alt-delete.  There are no multiple saves, so if you accidentally click the "save wtihout quitting" rather than the "quit without saving" button, then your campain is screwed.  No confirmation what-so-ever.  There is no menu command to quit the game without passing through several loading screens first.  These are a few examples, but the UI suffers from other confusing issues as well and is a complete catastrophe.\n\nIts unfortunate because the game seems like it would be fun to play otherwise.  After being forced to re-roll my team from scratch 5 times due to UI blunders, I'm disinclined to play and uninterested in purchasing again in the future.\n","October 12, 2014","false","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Good, because blood bowl makes that look really bloody fair!\n\nFirst off, honestly the tutorial is utter crap your best bet is to youtube how to play or ask a friend who already knows. Secondly the Singe player is highly unfair for new players but still good for practising new tactics, so don't expect an amazing single player experience.\n\nMultiplayer is much fairer to players old and new, players can set up their own leagues to how they want (need a minimum of 4 teams though) most of the leagues atm are for teams that have just been created so it boils down to player style, skill and knowledge.... But not of that matters if the dice decide that you're just not gonna hand the ball to the guy infront of you because your player had a brain fart.\n\nSummary?\nYou'll probably scream at this game at first and say its unfair and full of random crap and it can be at times why? Because its more fun to watch you get excited to run to the end line only for your player to fall and die after they failed the roll when "going for it". If you manage to survive all of crap the game throws at you at the start then well done .. No seriously well done.\n\nIf you can't beat the other team, injure, maime or kill as many as possible before the game ends. ;)\n\nP.S\nF***k all Elves and their nasty habbit of dodging through multiple tackle zones, that is all.","March 10, 2015","true","154.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Most of the time, it will deal with giving you great or bad die rolls.  But sometimes, matches can be quite exciting or entertaining.\n\nA slew of different races in which to choose from.\n\nGraphics are pretty good.\n\nWith each race, you have your strengths and weaknesses.  Those strengths and weaknesses can determine your style of play whether you decide to want to pass the ball, run the ball, or forget the ball and do killing instead, or even throw your own players around the field.\n\nStrategy can be extremely important, so needing strategy in this game is vital.\n\nCons:\n\nCan get exremely frustrating.  1)  Bad die rolls can last a while.  This, in effect, can make a match completely useless or boring for you to play.  And sometimes can destroy your team if the opposition gets great die rolls continuously.  This can hurt your team for the next match as you may be missing valuable players.  This happens frequently with low armour value teams.  2)  After spending time playing your team and getting them skilled up, one match can change your teams effectiveness massively with multiple deaths.  Beware!!!  This is really frustrating and can often lead to you not coming back to play for a while or even entirely.  Especially if it happens more than once....\n\nThe crowd doesn't look that big.  You have the occasional fan to watch the game instead of a crowd....  Felt more like the fans are on a family trip picnicing next to the field....\n\nThe balancing method of the game between a rookie team and experienced team needs to be tweeked.  As it stands, usually the more experienced teams will beat the rookie teams due to less chances of failure.\n\nDepending on which race you choose to play, you may find yourself unable to have a full roster before the start of the matches.  Even though they give you hired help to fill in on missing players, those hired hands come with drawbacks and are not valued cheaper than your team players.\n\nNot all teams are equal in regards to chances of winning.  Some teams can take a pounding and give a pounding back.  Other teams are more centered around moving the ball, but usually find themselves lacking players by half-time.  You must adjust and play differently when this happens.\n\nSeason mode sounds great!  And I love the concept of it.  However, when your team takes a pounding, you lose experienced players, and so on... you may find yourself in a much harder situation than you were in before you started playing the match in the first place.  One match can make or break your team for a few games if not more due to deaths and permanent injuries.  Btw, permanent injuries DO NOT adjust the value of your player to something less, although you will or may feel the impact of the injury later on.\n\nFor certain teams, income is very much needed to keep your team caught up.  Elves are a prime example.  They are very expensive, and if you get a few bad die rolls on the income, you may find that you don't have 11 players anymore.  More often than not, you will be using your money to "keep up" rather than getting ahead.  And if you don't get those td's or casualties to help boost your money, you be struggling to simply provide a challenge to your opponents.  If you play a high armoured team, this is much less of a problem as your chances of losing players will be much less chancy...\n\nWith the game being frustrating at times, matchmaking poses a problem.  Players tend to drop from matches frequently when you are dominating the match.  Sometimes they drop to "save" their team.  Others drop because they cry too much (which is in almost every game that has pvp).  Or they drop because the match wasn't fun at all for them.  So there are a lot of dropped matches.\n\nCertain abilities are too potent.  Any ability that increases their chances of killing an opponent that has a low armour value is op'd (at least in this game).  Now add in combined abilities that add an even more potency.  Ouch!  lol  Guard is another ability that can be op'd, as well as a few other abilites....\n\nWhen you get a streak of bad luck, it can continue for a long time.  My longest duration of this would be seven games in a row!  No td's because bad die rolls when throwing the ball, blitzing, and dodging makes it difficult to win....  And with the opponents getting awesome die rolls when their turn comes along, I found myself unable to put any challenge forth with the opponents.  I lost 1 player a match (killed) on average.  No casualties inflicted (on the opponent) and no td's means that I didn't get any boost to money to replace lost players.  So after seven matches, I lost seven players, replaced one of them (average of 20k a match and the players costing 70-110k to replace), and not being able to buy anything to upgrade my team such as cheerleaders, coaches, or re-rolls.  I was extremely frustrated and bored.  I lost a lot of exitement to play again.\n\n\nOverall, if you can bear through the bad die rolls and frustrations of the game that can happen to you, this game can be very good with strategy and luck.  Excitement is minimal until that all important thing needs to be done.  That one moment that that one blitz wins you the match, or that one moment where you were able to throw that long bomb and scored the td, can make that match worth while for you to play!\n","March 11, 2015","true","505.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Tactical turn based. The mechanics are awesome and the skill required is amazing, but having it rendered into a video game makes some of the flaws from the original board game come to light. The ability to injure players permanently, or kill them, makes a lot of team types unviable in a meta-centric computer gaming enviornment. If you want sustainability you're going to get claw and mighty blow on every single character you can. The injury system needs to be reworked for bb2. It really does. I have no complaints about the game other than that. It just needs to nerf one of the injury powers or add a third injury table for deaths and permanent injuries, a further roll of 10-12+ to confirm permanent injuries otherwise, outside of a nice tabletop league at the local hobby-shop, there will never be a reason to get attached to any team that isn't dwarf, orc, or chaos.","March 5, 2015","true","459.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Non admined leagues you can expect some disappointing opponents. Private leagues/tournaments/cups certainly do deliver in terms of quality match ups and an understanding that the matchmaking casuals who screw around are not welcome.

Although match making really does not deliver in terms of quality gameplay that's not because of the game itself but the players rather (coaches) using exploits or manipulating the connection. Non admined leagues you can expect some disappointing opponents. Private leagues/tournaments/cups certainly do deliver in terms of quality match ups and an understanding that the matchmaking casuals who screw around are not welcome. That's the beauty of being able to tell the difference, since each profile gives a lot of specific information about the coach. If yo uare seen disconnecting and not completing your games or have a poor reliability rate you most likely will not be welcome in to the competititve scene. You really have to earn your reputation as an "honest" playing coach. Well moderated allowing the best coaches to be able to develop their teams and progress to different divisions and truly get the gamers moneys worth. The community is absolutely fantastic for the most part they are essentially the in game tutorial for newbies that don't know how to use the game interface/get themselves started. The game offers plenty of blood and lots of fun which is really what it's all about.","August 8, 2014","true","490.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Oh you.\n\nA turn-based RTS game inspired by american football, but with fantasy races and extra violence. Want to see a game of Werewolves vs Orks? How about Elves vs Dwarves? Just another day in Bloodbowl.\n\nThe game, like its tabletop equivalent, is centered entirely around six-sided die rolls to determine the results of actions. While many different strategies can be applied to win games (ranging from the "long pass," the "passing train," or "KILL THEM ALL") and you'll surely find one suited to your style. The factions are diverse and the differences between them are meaningful, leading to a fun experience where you'll want to try out every faction, just to see what it's like!\n\nThat being said, the game is very unforgiving. On a six-sided die, you will roll a surprising amount of fails. While this is just a part of the game, it's can be quite frustrating to new players, and there is a definite learning curve that one has to get past before you can really appreciate the depth of the game. Another thing that can be quite frustrating is that players from your team (and the enemy team) can get injured, sometimes permanently, which in tournaments can be devastating. Still, it's all part of the game, and you'll surely learn to love it as i did!\n\nIf you love turn-based RTS games, or have a macabre fantasy of "what would football be like if it was extra violent?" then this is definitely a "must try."\n\n","August 5, 2014","true","129.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Is your opponent scoring touch downs left and right? Kill them. Are they trash talking you? Kill them. Are you winning? Kill them. Are you being killed? Kill yourself?.... In this game the only thing that comes easy is brutally losing. It's about making the best out of the worst situations by being ready. You can see that turd slowly migrating over to that fan. Its quite a distance away, but you're certain that sneaky little crap nugget is inching towards it behind your back. So, when it isn't looking, you get yourself a jumbo tarp and pin it to every surface in your room. Suddenly, when it hits the fan, you're ready, and not everything goes as badly as once thought.\n\nThat all being said, this game is utterly rage enducing. You could have everything perfectly planned out, where your opponent has 1/1000 odds to score that touchdown. Suddenly, their star halfback dodges 4 players, dives into a crowd of players, grabs the ball, does a front flip over your towering ogre, hurls a hail mary, which a wide receiver catches in heavy traffic. They then proceed to dodge 2 more tackles, and score a touchdown.\n\nAnother instance. You kick off the ball, and the fans rush onto the pitch, brutally violating every orifice of your players bodies. While downed, the opponent gets an easy touch down setup, and proceeds to kill half your team in three turns.  with no nope of recovery, you lose everyone that you cared about, even your wife and child.\n\nYet another instance. Your star player with 35/36 odds of evading a tackle gets pimp slapped and breaks his neck, instantly dying. Your star players best friend rushes over to cradle his dying comrade, but trips on his own shoelaces, dying tragically by impaling himself with his own horns in a somersault. The apothecary rushes onto the field to try and save them, but ends up only able to get one into a wheel chair.\n\nIn some cases, you seemingly have a majestic dice rolling god on your side. Giving you the power to smite anything that even looks at your team with spite. The game does what it wants. You can either hate it or love it.\n\nThe game is great fun, and thanks to the ability to customize your players with a plethora of abilities, mutations, and stat upgrades, makes it feel like its truly your team.\n\nIts american football, or rugby for the most part.... with legal murder tacked on! Just try to bare with the game and it'll grow on you like a sick and twisted cluster of tentacles.","July 15, 2015","true","130.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That's one of many ways to describe Blood Bowl, a game that has you jumping for joy one minute and crying the next.\n\nBased off the original board game, Blood Bowl is an American Football game mixed with chess-like strategy. You'll position players, throw blocks, and hopefully score touchdowns. Graphically BB doesn't offer much, you have a handful of stadiums and some customizable players, but where Blood Bowl really shines is its diverse character roster. 23 races fill BB stadiums, from the sleek Amazons, to the toughened Orcs, to the completely useless Halfling teams, each race works differently, and it's up to you to find which one fits your play style. For those who love destroying the enemy team, the minotaur teams of Chaos are for you, boasting strong players to help maim as many players as possible. Want to go around them, Skaven will do just fine. Wanna launch a hail mary, High Elf. However, keep in mind that each team has conflicting weakness that you must tailor your strategy to.\n\nBB plays out kind of like chess and American Football wrapped in one. Two teams battle it out over 16 turns to score as many touchdowns as possible. This is where things get interesting. It takes a whle to get used to the rules and understand how everything works, but stick it out and you'll see the beauty. You'll see all kinds of strategies, like the typical punch everything style of Orcs to the outrageous physical game with Skaven, and you have to tailor your plan accordingly. Keep in mind that all the mechanics are dice based, like the original board game, so even though you baited the team and are set to make a perfect hand off, Nuffle (the BB God of the Dice) may say "Nope!" and have him drop the ball, so no strategy is fool proof. When your not beating people/getting beaten sensless, you're buying players, leveling up players, and hiring cheerleaders and coaches. Blood Bowl's skill system is a lttle weird, having you roll dice. If you roll singles, you get to choose from a select few. Singles over a certain amount allow you to boost one of their skills. Doubles lets pick any skill or, if allowed, mutate, which gives you special abilities for certain races AND changes the corresponding character model, so expect to see a few Chaos Beastmen with tentacles, claws, or an extra head or arm.\n\nThe Verdict:\n+Fun Customization\n+Strategies for each race\n+23 races\n-Dice based combat system\n\n8/10 Great\n\nIf you can get past the rules, find the right team, and accept that a few bad rolls are going to happen, then I sincerely recommend buy Blood Bowl.","January 1, 2014","true","60.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As a note, although this game offers a single player experience, it's really meant to be played multiplayer. To really get the most from it you have to join a league where you can take advantage of growing a team with game-to-game improvements, assuming too many of your players don't get seriously hurt or die during the games. This involves some headaches having to schedule weekly matches with other players but the combination of American football, chess and craps with RPG leveling mechanics on players makes for a very entertaining game.","February 6, 2013","true","279.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That's one of many ways to describe Blood Bowl, a game that has you jumping for joy one minute and crying the next.\n\nBased off the original board game, Blood Bowl is an American Football game mixed with chess-like strategy. You'll position players, throw blocks, and hopefully score touchdowns. Graphically BB doesn't offer much, you have a handful of stadiums and some customizable players, but where Blood Bowl really shines is its diverse character roster. 23 races fill BB stadiums, from the sleek Amazons, to the toughened Orcs, to the completely useless Halfling teams, each race works differently, and it's up to you to find which one fits your play style. For those who love destroying the enemy team, the minotaur teams of Chaos are for you, boasting strong players to help maim as many players as possible. Want to go around them, Skaven will do just fine. Wanna launch a hail mary, High Elf. However, keep in mind that each team has conflicting weakness that you must tailor your strategy to.\n\nBB plays out kind of like chess and American Football wrapped in one. Two teams battle it out over 16 turns to score as many touchdowns as possible. This is where things get interesting. It takes a whle to get used to the rules and understand how everything works, but stick it out and you'll see the beauty. You'll see all kinds of strategies, like the typical punch everything style of Orcs to the outrageous physical game with Skaven, and you have to tailor your plan accordingly. Keep in mind that all the mechanics are dice based, like the original board game, so even though you baited the team and are set to make a perfect hand off, Nuffle (the BB God of the Dice) may say "Nope!" and have him drop the ball, so no strategy is fool proof. When your not beating people/getting beaten sensless, you're buying players, leveling up players, and hiring cheerleaders and coaches. Blood Bowl's skill system is a lttle weird, having you roll dice. If you roll singles, you get to choose from a select few. Singles over a certain amount allow you to boost one of their skills. Doubles lets pick any skill or, if allowed, mutate, which gives you special abilities for certain races AND changes the corresponding character model, so expect to see a few Chaos Beastmen with tentacles, claws, or an extra head or arm.\n\nThe Verdict:\n+Fun Customization\n+Strategies for each race\n+23 races\n-Dice based combat system\n\n8/10 Great\n\nIf you can get past the rules, find the right team, and accept that a few bad rolls are going to happen, then I sincerely recommend buy Blood Bowl.","January 1, 2014","true","60.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Good, because blood bowl makes that look really bloody fair!\n\nFirst off, honestly the tutorial is utter crap your best bet is to youtube how to play or ask a friend who already knows. Secondly the Singe player is highly unfair for new players but still good for practising new tactics, so don't expect an amazing single player experience.\n\nMultiplayer is much fairer to players old and new, players can set up their own leagues to how they want (need a minimum of 4 teams though) most of the leagues atm are for teams that have just been created so it boils down to player style, skill and knowledge.... But not of that matters if the dice decide that you're just not gonna hand the ball to the guy infront of you because your player had a brain fart.\n\nSummary?\nYou'll probably scream at this game at first and say its unfair and full of random crap and it can be at times why? Because its more fun to watch you get excited to run to the end line only for your player to fall and die after they failed the roll when "going for it". If you manage to survive all of crap the game throws at you at the start then well done .. No seriously well done.\n\nIf you can't beat the other team, injure, maime or kill as many as possible before the game ends. ;)\n\nP.S\nF***k all Elves and their nasty habbit of dodging through multiple tackle zones, that is all.","March 10, 2015","true","154.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Most of the time, it will deal with giving you great or bad die rolls.  But sometimes, matches can be quite exciting or entertaining.\n\nA slew of different races in which to choose from.\n\nGraphics are pretty good.\n\nWith each race, you have your strengths and weaknesses.  Those strengths and weaknesses can determine your style of play whether you decide to want to pass the ball, run the ball, or forget the ball and do killing instead, or even throw your own players around the field.\n\nStrategy can be extremely important, so needing strategy in this game is vital.\n\nCons:\n\nCan get exremely frustrating.  1)  Bad die rolls can last a while.  This, in effect, can make a match completely useless or boring for you to play.  And sometimes can destroy your team if the opposition gets great die rolls continuously.  This can hurt your team for the next match as you may be missing valuable players.  This happens frequently with low armour value teams.  2)  After spending time playing your team and getting them skilled up, one match can change your teams effectiveness massively with multiple deaths.  Beware!!!  This is really frustrating and can often lead to you not coming back to play for a while or even entirely.  Especially if it happens more than once....\n\nThe crowd doesn't look that big.  You have the occasional fan to watch the game instead of a crowd....  Felt more like the fans are on a family trip picnicing next to the field....\n\nThe balancing method of the game between a rookie team and experienced team needs to be tweeked.  As it stands, usually the more experienced teams will beat the rookie teams due to less chances of failure.\n\nDepending on which race you choose to play, you may find yourself unable to have a full roster before the start of the matches.  Even though they give you hired help to fill in on missing players, those hired hands come with drawbacks and are not valued cheaper than your team players.\n\nNot all teams are equal in regards to chances of winning.  Some teams can take a pounding and give a pounding back.  Other teams are more centered around moving the ball, but usually find themselves lacking players by half-time.  You must adjust and play differently when this happens.\n\nSeason mode sounds great!  And I love the concept of it.  However, when your team takes a pounding, you lose experienced players, and so on... you may find yourself in a much harder situation than you were in before you started playing the match in the first place.  One match can make or break your team for a few games if not more due to deaths and permanent injuries.  Btw, permanent injuries DO NOT adjust the value of your player to something less, although you will or may feel the impact of the injury later on.\n\nFor certain teams, income is very much needed to keep your team caught up.  Elves are a prime example.  They are very expensive, and if you get a few bad die rolls on the income, you may find that you don't have 11 players anymore.  More often than not, you will be using your money to "keep up" rather than getting ahead.  And if you don't get those td's or casualties to help boost your money, you be struggling to simply provide a challenge to your opponents.  If you play a high armoured team, this is much less of a problem as your chances of losing players will be much less chancy...\n\nWith the game being frustrating at times, matchmaking poses a problem.  Players tend to drop from matches frequently when you are dominating the match.  Sometimes they drop to "save" their team.  Others drop because they cry too much (which is in almost every game that has pvp).  Or they drop because the match wasn't fun at all for them.  So there are a lot of dropped matches.\n\nCertain abilities are too potent.  Any ability that increases their chances of killing an opponent that has a low armour value is op'd (at least in this game).  Now add in combined abilities that add an even more potency.  Ouch!  lol  Guard is another ability that can be op'd, as well as a few other abilites....\n\nWhen you get a streak of bad luck, it can continue for a long time.  My longest duration of this would be seven games in a row!  No td's because bad die rolls when throwing the ball, blitzing, and dodging makes it difficult to win....  And with the opponents getting awesome die rolls when their turn comes along, I found myself unable to put any challenge forth with the opponents.  I lost 1 player a match (killed) on average.  No casualties inflicted (on the opponent) and no td's means that I didn't get any boost to money to replace lost players.  So after seven matches, I lost seven players, replaced one of them (average of 20k a match and the players costing 70-110k to replace), and not being able to buy anything to upgrade my team such as cheerleaders, coaches, or re-rolls.  I was extremely frustrated and bored.  I lost a lot of exitement to play again.\n\n\nOverall, if you can bear through the bad die rolls and frustrations of the game that can happen to you, this game can be very good with strategy and luck.  Excitement is minimal until that all important thing needs to be done.  That one moment that that one blitz wins you the match, or that one moment where you were able to throw that long bomb and scored the td, can make that match worth while for you to play!\n","March 11, 2015","true","505.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

After 10 plus hours, I can play the computer only on Easy Difficulty setting.  I guess the answer is right there. Because its challenging. As you probably know that this is a trun based game that is mix of Rugby and madness. Every action you perform in this game, like picking up a ball, running with the ball, puching an opponent etc. requires you throw a dice to check for success in performing that action. The dice has a very high chance in failing you in this game. It fails your AI or human opponent as well. So its fair in that sense. But when you fail to pick up the ball twice in a row, it can be frustrating. I am still playing this game and bought BB2 so I guess I must like this game.

That gets a little old after a while. There's no sense of permancy other than on your side of the pitch, and it makes it tempting to rely on "save-scumming" to get through tricky matches.\n* I would vastly prefer a way to choose exactly which teams are 'legal' - even if it was just a way to pick which of the expansion teams were included rather than the current all-or-nothing approach. Be prepared for constant, tedious battles with Khemri...\n* If playing a solo game, the computer continually spams pathetic 'smack talk' style messages at you in chat, which do nothing to aid immersion but reveal rather more about what the developers think of you as a person (or what kind of person they think plays their game).\nThose annoyances aside, it's really not a bad game at all.\n","March 27, 2015","true","111.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you want sustainability you're going to get claw and mighty blow on every single character you can. The injury system needs to be reworked for bb2. It really does. I have no complaints about the game other than that. It just needs to nerf one of the injury powers or add a third injury table for deaths and permanent injuries, a further roll of 10-12+ to confirm permanent injuries otherwise, outside of a nice tabletop league at the local hobby-shop, there will never be a reason to get attached to any team that isn't dwarf, orc, or chaos.","March 5, 2015","true","459.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even if you're not a Warhammer geek however, this sports/combat game is well worth a look.\n\nBlood Bowl takes many elements from Rugby and American football and combines them with the brutal and violent Warhammer universe. The rules are much simpler than football, but at the end of the day, the goals are essentially the same; getting the ball into the enemy's endzone, and outlasting (quite literally) the opponent. Death and performance impacting injuries can and will happen at any time, and can easily result in a turning of the tides.\n\nYou can play dirty and rely on injuries and special tactics to win, you can play passing and running games similar to traditional football, if you can consistently withstand the enemy, you can just run the clock out. Creativity is key in a game with so few rules! Not too much of a learning curve, well worth the reward.\n\nThe few cons are notable. There are definitely balance problems between the races, especially when starting a brand new campaign. It may be difficult to find opponents in multiplayer without joining a league, and you should be ready to get your ♥♥♥ kicked a lot. Blood Bowl is also notorious for random crashes, and Chaos Edition is no exception. It's worse for some than others, so make sure to save after each game.\n\nAll in all, if you're looking for a game that blends sports and hand to hand combat together, and can't afford/run Blood Bowl II, look no further.

Blood Bowl (BB) is the game of Fantasy Football, akin to real-life Rugby (play only halts when a point is scored) or American Football, only with excessive violence, death, secret weapons and even magic. Oh, and the ball has spikes on it. The players who form the 23 types of team to choose from come from a range of classic fantasy races: Elves, Dwarves, Undead, Orcs - they're all there. Each has its own play style, so I would advise you try a variety to find ones that suit you (for me, it's Wood Elves especially, with their incredible Wardancers). Races not for beginners: Chaos, Goblin, Halfling, Khemri, Nurgle, Ogre and Vampire.\n\nBe aware: this game is based on dice-rolling, so luck plays a part. BUT there is also lots of strategy to it, from more basic ideas like risk management and positioning, to the more complex such as chainpushing and team builds/management/development (useful site - http://bbtactics.com/). 90% of the few hundred games I've played have felt like the better player won. Sometimes bad luck really does strike yes, but if you analyse your game-play you usually could've made some better decisions, too. Don't be put off by what seems like bad luck in your first few games, but be warned that this game requires some patience to get good at.\n\nOnline leagues are where this game really comes to life. The AI seems hard at first, but can become too easy quite quickly. Online you get the challenge of real players, can choose options such turn length (I would highly recommend 2 minute turns) and even make your own league! 'Naggaroth Open' league is great for matchmaking, as it has a very good community, but it's probably a good idea to start off in Auld World (once you can regularly beat the AI on 'Medium'). There are a couple of rare, minor bugs in online play (the '12-player' and the infamous 'invisible player' bug), but these are not game-breaking, and most community-run leagues have agreements about ways to get around it.\n\nSome of my best gaming experiences have been in Blood Bowl. The chaos, fun and replayablity is huge. It's just great.","August 13, 2015","true","311.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even if you're not a Warhammer geek however, this sports/combat game is well worth a look.\n\nBlood Bowl takes many elements from Rugby and American football and combines them with the brutal and violent Warhammer universe. The rules are much simpler than football, but at the end of the day, the goals are essentially the same; getting the ball into the enemy's endzone, and outlasting (quite literally) the opponent. Death and performance impacting injuries can and will happen at any time, and can easily result in a turning of the tides.\n\nYou can play dirty and rely on injuries and special tactics to win, you can play passing and running games similar to traditional football, if you can consistently withstand the enemy, you can just run the clock out. Creativity is key in a game with so few rules! Not too much of a learning curve, well worth the reward.\n\nThe few cons are notable. There are definitely balance problems between the races, especially when starting a brand new campaign. It may be difficult to find opponents in multiplayer without joining a league, and you should be ready to get your ♥♥♥ kicked a lot. Blood Bowl is also notorious for random crashes, and Chaos Edition is no exception. It's worse for some than others, so make sure to save after each game.\n\nAll in all, if you're looking for a game that blends sports and hand to hand combat together, and can't afford/run Blood Bowl II, look no further.

Blood Bowl (BB) is the game of Fantasy Football, akin to real-life Rugby (play only halts when a point is scored) or American Football, only with excessive violence, death, secret weapons and even magic. Oh, and the ball has spikes on it. The players who form the 23 types of team to choose from come from a range of classic fantasy races: Elves, Dwarves, Undead, Orcs - they're all there. Each has its own play style, so I would advise you try a variety to find ones that suit you (for me, it's Wood Elves especially, with their incredible Wardancers). Races not for beginners: Chaos, Goblin, Halfling, Khemri, Nurgle, Ogre and Vampire.\n\nBe aware: this game is based on dice-rolling, so luck plays a part. BUT there is also lots of strategy to it, from more basic ideas like risk management and positioning, to the more complex such as chainpushing and team builds/management/development (useful site - http://bbtactics.com/). 90% of the few hundred games I've played have felt like the better player won.

The concept of BB and its universe is so rich that this should have been an amazing game BUT Cyanide got the licence to develop the game and, unfortunately, they butchered it, initially.  Whilst the initial release of this game was horrible, after several years/patches/upgrades, it is now very enjoyable 7.5/10. The interface and UI are still terrible, but you will get used to it. And the graphics now look pretty dated compared to BB2, but dont let that put you off.  This is an infinitely better game than BB2, which Cyanide is doing its best job to butcher, again.\n\nBuy this if you like a bit of a tactical level up grind'fest.\nDont buy this if you are a bad loser - the random number generated (RNG) dice rolls do feel somewhat 'rigged' against you sometimes.....","November 4, 2015","true","273.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

After 10 plus hours, I can play the computer only on Easy Difficulty setting.  I guess the answer is right there. Because its challenging. As you probably know that this is a trun based game that is mix of Rugby and madness. Every action you perform in this game, like picking up a ball, running with the ball, puching an opponent etc. requires you throw a dice to check for success in performing that action. The dice has a very high chance in failing you in this game. It fails your AI or human opponent as well. So its fair in that sense. But when you fail to pick up the ball twice in a row, it can be frustrating. I am still playing this game and bought BB2 so I guess I must like this game.

Even if you're not a Warhammer geek however, this sports/combat game is well worth a look.\n\nBlood Bowl takes many elements from Rugby and American football and combines them with the brutal and violent Warhammer universe. The rules are much simpler than football, but at the end of the day, the goals are essentially the same; getting the ball into the enemy's endzone, and outlasting (quite literally) the opponent. Death and performance impacting injuries can and will happen at any time, and can easily result in a turning of the tides.\n\nYou can play dirty and rely on injuries and special tactics to win, you can play passing and running games similar to traditional football, if you can consistently withstand the enemy, you can just run the clock out. Creativity is key in a game with so few rules! Not too much of a learning curve, well worth the reward.\n\nThe few cons are notable. There are definitely balance problems between the races, especially when starting a brand new campaign. It may be difficult to find opponents in multiplayer without joining a league, and you should be ready to get your ♥♥♥ kicked a lot. Blood Bowl is also notorious for random crashes, and Chaos Edition is no exception. It's worse for some than others, so make sure to save after each game.\n\nAll in all, if you're looking for a game that blends sports and hand to hand combat together, and can't afford/run Blood Bowl II, look no further. Highly recommended!","October 1, 2015","true","88.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are, of course, other factors, too, which influence scoring but for the sake of keeping this review short I merely wanna point out that one halftime simply isn't long enough to allow either mistakes or bad dice rolls by the player or AI. Sure, sometimes you're lucky and score two times but that's quite rare. Only long passes might help you to score more often if you're lucky...\n\n2) The code makes no difference between long and short term effects. When you completely dominate the enemy team even their weakest player will suddenly start to kill your best player as some sort of weird vengeance mechanic, I guess? Even using a medic doesn't seem to help there what makes blood bowl look like a litte desperate.. Since that's not the only situation where BS happens I must come to the conclusion that there's definitively some shenanigans going on behind the curtain instead of random RNG..\n\nI suppose the game is more fun online.. I usually played on medium difficulty with standard settings.. 4/10 for stupid random BS and only 8 turns per halftime.. It's simply no fun to know that you won't be able to score, not to mention other oddities which take the fun out of the game for no real reason but causing anger and frustration.. Don't destroy the AI or some random midget will kill your best player, experience that three times to cry foul at that game..","August 23, 2015","false","96.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a bit to get used to at first, but once you do it's a good time...if you have a friend(The single-player is pretty boring honestly).  It takes a lot of strategery and knowing your team well!","June 3","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Has all the races and if you enjoyed the board game you'll love this. Worth the price, but even better value if you can get it on sale.","January 3, 2013","true","36.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
