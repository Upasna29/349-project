As with GT this one refers to many popular games and laughs are around every corner. The major difference from the main series however, is the fact that the player this time controls "his semidevine humble self Holy Avatar" directly on his quest to rid his holiday island from a zombie maiden infested plague.\n\nGameplay wise, this game keeps it simple. The story and progression is linear most of the time. Only when one is mid-way through the story, order of completing some quests becomes optional.\n\nThe battle system will be immediately familiar and proofs to be not very deep. It is clearly not aiming for hardcore S-RPG players, which means even below-average skilled players like me can win the battles and enjoy the story.\n\nIn the end I can recommend this one to everybody who enjoyed GT 1 & 2, because you will definitely have a good time here.\nThe same goes for newcomers who are looking for a parody of popular games and familiar gaming cliches. Just don't expect too much of challenge!!","March 30, 2014","true","6.6"," 46 of 51 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","46","51","0","1"

It is exactly what you would expect in the GT series (humor and all things considered).\n\nThe only difference is that the game is much shorter than the other 2 and way more linear.\n\nHere are a few observations:\n\n- The environment is a lot more vibrant thanks to the cell shading and the tropical theme. It's a shame that the game was so short.\n- Not much has changed as far as the hud/interface goes. I expected a more refined design seeing as this is the 3rd game in the series.\n- The game was too easy. Even with the difficulty slider, there's not a huge leap in content difficulty.\n\nAs you can see, I don't have a lot to say about the game. It was just way too short in my opinion. As I already mentioned, this game brings more of the same from the first 2 games. That's why despite the not so awesome review, I can still strongly recommend it to people who liked and completed the other games in the series.","March 12, 2014","true","5.9"," 39 of 47 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","39","47","0","0"

Imagine him coming back with three of his favourite girlfriends to Holy Island to relax, which is a tropical island full of virgin slaves, goblins and elfes. First decision: Put on your red hot swimsuits and help me fighting the deadly hugging lovebears. So far so good.\n\nWho's this guy with long blonde hair growing til his back, bearded + dark sunglasses? Idk but somehow he's is very, very cool. Ah yes the story begins, when some of the island virgins transform into blood greedy zombies. But how worse the situation will come and people are really dying here ... Holy Avatar has everytime a good story to tell or laughing about the stupidity of his virgin friends. There's a lot of cliche and accidently sexy moments happening during the story.

I thought I would be immediately put off around five minutes into playtime, but I found myself quite surprised by it. While this certainly isn't the best game out there, it's got it's own unique charm - that I believe - should be given a chance.\n\nI found the characters to be refreshing. They aren't super complex or deep, the opposite really, but I think it plays to it's strength. The main character is self-centered, misogynistic, and completely oblivious to it. The 'love' interest is flighty and hangs on the main characters every word, despite having to do his bidding - even at her own expense.\n\nThere are a ton of pop culture references in the game if you are familiar with them. (Things like that always tickle my fancy.) And the dialogue, while pretty limited, is pretty endearing. The graphics aren't anything to write home about, but I've found that because the environment is bright, made it pleasing for me to play.\n\nNow this doesn't mean that there weren't a few things that didn't bug me. There were. Like how the camera liked to fly away when I moved my mouse. Or how certain dialogue no longer appeared in a box - which made it hard to follow. Then there was one point where there was a battle with scripted dialogue, but I moved and killed something before the scripted actions finished - effectively leaving me stuck and making me reload. Text will automatically scroll fast in the beginning until you change the speed. But none of this was actually enough to stop me from finishing.\n\nSo to be super honest, this game - while enjoyable - is definitely what I call a 'one and done'. So once you finish, you probably won't play it again. So I advise to not buy it at full price; wait until a sale.","October 23, 2014","true","7.7"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","18","20","0","0"

I loved the first two grotesque tactics games. As soon as I saw this I immediatly bought it. The main problem with the game is, that there is less everything. Basically this game is, what the first ( maybe the first two) chapter in one of the first two games is. Only that the first two games had a bunch of chapters coming after that. It has fewer characters (barely any actually), fewer quests/places to go to, way fewer items and is extremely short in general. This is basially a DLC and not a game. Whats worst though, is that the humor this time falls flat. Where usually there was dark humor and many references to pop culture, now there still is a bit of that left but just a tiny bit and the jokes are basically sexist/blonde jokes, which can be funny and only offensive to really sensible people if you do it right, but they didnt do it right. The jokes are performed so clumsily that its hard to give anyone more than a grin at best. Now if this was only 2 dollars I'd say go ahead and take it if you are a fan of the series, since the few characters that you use are still the ones you know and love and a tiny bit of story unfolds itself which might interest you, but for the price it is at right now I can only say stay away, its not worth it.\n\nP.S: If you havent played the other games yet this game is just confusing and totally not worth your money on any sale.","September 25, 2014","false","4.7"," 21 of 30 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","21","30","0","0"

It is still fun but because it is shorter I would keep that in mind when considering a purchase. Unlike Grotesque Tactics 1-2 where you had a party of 6-10 characters, in this game you max out at 3 and none of them are new if you played GT 1-2. Also know that at least at the time of release/this review, there was no English audio, only German; I know they are hoping to add English though at some point and it is listed in the options menu, but tells you that it is not currently available. Of course there is English text, and there were some humorous parts; as long as you don't expect it to be as in-depth as GT 1-2 and think of it more as a short adventure episode/epilogue then I don't think you will be disappointed.","February 22, 2014","true","0.4"," 19 of 28 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","19","28","0","1"

As the mightiest of heroes, you embark upon a much deserved vacation to a remote island with a small entourage of personal maidens. Things quickly escalate from there, however, and you soon find yourself amidst another hair-brained adventure.\n\nFor anyone unfamiliar with the series - Grotesque Tactics is a parody RPG franchise that hails from Germany, with two previous entries. Similar to these past games, HAvsMotD combines isometric camera angles with a colorful 3D world full of whit and humor. The actual RPG aspects are surprisingly solid, though nothing especially complex of course. Hotbars, Combat Abilities, Skill Trees - all the usual suspects are present; plus, plenty of shiny loots to loot and sexy maidens to rescue! For combat, the old 'turn-based grid movement' formula is in effect.\n\nAll in all, well worth it's price and then some!","February 24, 2014","true","4.2"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","14","19","0","0"

While it is much shorter than Evil Heroes or Dungeons & Donuts, it ties up a few loose ends all the way back to Evil Heroes, while leaving some plot holes gaping open.

Speaking of which, the camera is unbelievably bad as well so you're constantly scrolling around to see anything.

After a few hours one of my characters got bugged, and now has -47 strength. That means she can't even move during combat, let alone attack.  Changing equipment doesn't help, and usually makes it worse.  I consider this to be gamebreaking and a deal-breaker.\n\n\nIt's a shame, because I was liking the game up until then.

I didn't expect much, given my prior experiences with Grotesque Tactics, but geez, how do these games make it past the QA department? Oh, right. There isn't one.\n\nBesides the rampant 80's style misogyny, which hey, I can overlook, the text crawls off the top whiz by without prompting as if the devs themselves can't be bothered to read it. Then you are thrust into a semi cel-shaded, kinda 3D isometric world that looks like a garage sale threw up on screen. I wouldn't mind that so much either if it weren't for the fact that moving around is like stumbling drunkebly through a house of mirrors.\n\nAlright that's all I have patience for writing about this. Even if you love the art style and think the jokes are funny, this is a grindy, run-of-the-mill RPG.

It's kinda cool that they are parodying the seriousness of fantasy rpgs (again) but it's far more silly than witty. It's also quite hard to make out many of the background conversations as the text boxes are tiny and disappear very quickly. Voice acting would have helped.\n\nThe fighting at the beginning is very tedious (before you get more advanced skills). And then when you get the better skills the game is over very soon after so don't get to use them much. I finished the game with characters only on lvl9/10 so hadn't upgraded much.\n\nI think the previous Grotesque tactics games are better so if you are on the fence about this one, get the bundle.\n\nI'd give this a 5/10. It's not terrible. There are a lot worse games out there, but also a lot better. Something like Blackguards fo example if you want to stick to this genre.","May 11","false","10.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
