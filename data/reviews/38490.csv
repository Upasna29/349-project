If you are reading this, it is a game that you probably enjoyed as a child years ago (or maybe adult, I don't judge). This game is EJ2, no doubts about it. It is not however, the game that you want to play.\n\nWhat is it then? This appears to be no more than the original code running in DOSBox. The game only supports the resolution of the era (640x480), fails to respond to mouse actions, and at times, fails to respond to basic keyboard actions. As other reviewers have stated, hit detection leaves a bit to be desired. This flaw turns Puppy Love from an adorable game of "aww, look, he is throwing puppies out the window" to "if that marshmallow misses another puppy in the middle I'm gonna lose it after Peter loses it on me." Also as other reviewers are saying, levels are missing (Lorenzen's Soil) or out of order (The Flyin' King).\n\nTo this day, I will pull out my Genesis and play some EJ2 to the last level. I would not however, play this game past the first level. This particular edition only serves as a last chance moneygrab from what once was a great enterprise. Do yourself (and your memories) a favor and play it on the consoles it was made for. Even if that means plugging in your old 386.","May 25, 2015","false","0.5"," 29 of 32 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","29","32","0","1"

Answer = NO.\n\nSteam version is a poorly D.O.S emulated pack (dosbox), I cant even turn volume music down on ewj2, is so loud that i can barely listen to the in-game Sounds :/\n\nas an EJ2 fan, i'm very doged, wow :'(","March 10, 2014","false","0.2"," 72 of 106 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","72","106","0","0"

Excellent gameplay, responsive controls, outrageous humor, terrific song and music, and fair difficulty. It's everything you want in a game, something that doesn't take itself too seriously and if you screwed up it wasn't the game's fault it's because you weren't good enough.\n\nSome are present here, however the port wasn't a clean one.\n\nHit detection can be dodgy, missing levels, sounds that just aren't plumb there. Even among the poor ports out there this is probably the worst of the bunch.\n\nIf you want to get Earthworm Jim, I'd recommend the SNES/Sega/SegaCD ports. You're missing out by getting this even if you are a fan of Earthworm Jim.","January 13, 2014","false","0.4"," 46 of 70 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","46","70","0","0"

This is the best game out of the EWJ Pack. One problem though, this version of EWJ2 doesn't have the second level, Lorenzo's Soil. This is also the DOSBox version of EWJ2 from The Whole Can 'O Worms pack for the PC, not that it's a problem, but it makes things a bit more pixelated.\n\nNote: I have Windows 7, and this works fine.","January 1, 2014","true","5.0"," 26 of 39 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","26","39","0","6"

EJ 2 features more level variety and weapons than the original.  It's the one I played the most as a kid....... I didn't have issues running it on my Windows XP system.  The controls and gameplay were responsive when I used keyboard or joystick and I completed several challenging levels.  It has CD-Quality sound.  The accapella intro is so classic !  Fullscreen is broken, however (I checked and I couldn't fix it with dosbox).  You will need to use an external zoom app to view it larger.  Also, I bought the EJ 1, 2, and 3D bundle.  Although Steam lists the games separately in the library, Interestlingly, when I installed the first game, Steam downloaded the files for all 3 games.  When I installed the others, Steam quickly did a "discovering existing files."","December 20, 2014","true","1.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

Boasting spectacular visuals and a myriad of playful innovations, Earthworm Jim clearly has the capacity to impress.\n\nThe product of Virgin coder Dave Perry and his band of Virgin defectors, collectively known as Shiny Entertainment, Earthworm Jim appears to contain all the ingredients for a superb videogame. Like Virgin’s Aladdin, the most obvious focus for admiration is the spectacular animation: the movement of Jim and the other characters in the game is sprightly and inventive, and there are lots of genuinely funny sequences that act as a real pull in the early stages.\n\nBuy this game, enjoyable, superbe and a jewel of the gaming industry !","January 23, 2014","true","0.1"," 7 of 18 people (39%) found this review helpful","39","7","18","0","0"

Otherwise, stay away and/or prepare to get a Steam refund. I posted instructions here to adjust them for EWJ1 and EWJ2:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/38480/discussions/0/541907867782189431/\n\nThe game was choppy. The controls weren't responsible at all. Audio had gaps. After the tweaks, it ran like it was supposed to, outside the occasional music gapping. The game itself seems like the CD version, and DOSBox is emulating a CD-Rom with audio tracks. I wonder if the newer DOSBox version has that fixed\n\nThis version has a trade-off. The music is recorded, unlike the SNES and Genesis versions. The music is also done really well. The graphics look better as well. You lose around 2 levels though.","August 9, 2015","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
