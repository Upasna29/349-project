That's right. Developer. One guy is programming this game, which is pretty amazing considering the steady rate of updates hat the game now sees. There is not a whole lot to do right now, but if things continue at their current pace, Sirius Online will become memorable for all the right reasons.","December 21, 2015","true","8.6"," 45 of 52 people (87%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","87","45","52","6","0"

Important !!!\nCurrently it is not yet a game to play (you can already do some things), it is ALPHA and you should be aware of this. Don't buy it, if you want to play immediately! Buy it if you want to support its development and if you want to play it in future!\n\nI say that, because reading the negativ reviews, it seems, that people do not understand, what early access stands for.\n\nAfter reading all reviews and every information about the game I decided to buy this game to support its development.\n\nThe vision of this game, as I understand when reading about it, is exactly what I am looking for: a space sim with mostly player generated content. A really multiplayer experience in space. If it will be massively multiplayer can not yet be said as this is difficult and expensive to realise. But for the beginning, multiplayer would be enough, at least for me.\n\nIt seems, that Sirius Online aims for the missing parts of Elite:Dangerous, namely depth. The PvE (Player versus Environment) of Elite:Dangerous is not enough content on a longer time scale. EVE Online is to much spreadsheet and not enough active action. Sirius Online can be the middle course in between and thats what I am hoping for.\n\nThe current client is already very good to handle. Its easy to fly around and controls seems to be on a good balance. Flying around is already fun. Mining is also possible, according to other reviews, but I didn't try. So, the game now has a good base to build the system on top of it and fill everything with the game mechanics. Graphics and sounds are fine too but not yet on a current state of the art but promissing.\n\nWhen you start the game, be prepared that the developer is somewhere around and talks to you. Giving input or asking questions directly to the developer is very nice and not very often seen. But if this game gains momentum it will be more difficult for him, to be accessible like that. So don't expect this in future.\n\nConclusion:\nPromissing game idea and a sound base already available, but yet a lot of things to do. Buy it to help the developer to make it real.\n\nTo the developer: Great game, exceptional endurance. Stay on this path and we will be with you. Maybe you should consider to bring some more people into your development.\n\nRex\n","January 8","true","3.7"," 26 of 30 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","26","30","0","0"

Then I played it and looked up the price. It is one dollar at the time of this review.\n\nONE DOLLAR. So, ya, it's totally worth it.\n\nThe wait for an actual Freelancer style game will be some time. This game has more problems than Carter had pills. I've spent more on Android games that had less, still.\n\nMy personal experience may be different than yours but it was this experience that will keep me waiting for updates and eventually a release.\n\nSo, my buddy and I got into this game after he gifted it to me and it rapidly became apparant that there was not much to it. You spawn in, there is no map. Most of the keys do nothing. Spacebar to toggle mouse flight. AI that fly's the same way and can be exploited. Mining is super esay. Fly up super close and shoot it till you are full of cargo. No explanations on ships or much of anything in the store. Basically the most basics of all things. Kinda like playing an old school Ninetendo game that was a lot of trial and error.\n\nThis is what did it for me. The Developer logs in. Ya, that guy. The one person making this game. He answered all questions we had and told of some of his future plans. He even spawned in a huge Capital craft that made everything else look like a tiny ink blot. His love for this game is apparant and you can honestly feel his passion.\n\nI will stay in the loop and wait until this has some more playability and I would usually tell everyone to run from a title like this but the developer did it for me. My buddy even had framerate issues and the Dev tried to fix it right then and there. The Cap ship was a sight to see and his dreams of future development are astounding.\n\nGet it. Play it.","January 7","true","14.9"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

I met a fellow player who helped me a lot, he tought me the best places to go to make serious money and the best way to get through the early access at the moment.\n\nThe things I was told was:\nFly from the Andromeda Station to Sirius IV (Go past Sirius II, then keep a lookour for Sirius IV and use the raday (shift+v))\nAs soon as Sirius IV is visible look for GNC15 and head towards it.\nOnce you've reached it sell all ores in the Market tab (F5).\nNext look for an asteroid belt that contains the letters 1982 and head towards it.\nStay on the outer edges on the asteroid belt and mine the smaller asteroids by noclipping inside the astoroid (just fly inside it)\nOnce your cargo's full return to GNC15 and sell everything, you'll even collect Elitium which is worth the most.\nOnce everything is sold repeat the steps until you can afford a mining ship (labelled 'M' in the ship section of the market)\nYou'll be able to store a lot more ore with a mining ship, I recommend the 'Kliper'.There is also a chance you'll log back into the game with the starting ship and be back at the Andromeda Station, so it's best to save up 500k+ maybe even 1mil so you can easily purchase ships if you die and lose it.\n\nGood luck fellow players, and I can't wait to play this after it's full release!","January 31","true","5.1"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

It may not really be worth a purchase at the moment but this is definitely a game worth following at least to see how it turns out. If you played Freelancer and are a fan of the game then you'll most definitely want to check this game out. Plays and feels like it.\n\nWhile there are quite a lot of bugs and the game is currently bare bones, there is a lot you can forgive it for considering there is only one dev I believe working on it. Considering what you usually expect from Early Access games it plays surprisingly well minus the few bugs in controls and netcode so far seems good. Currently there is only PvP and Mining at the moment, oh and flying into the darkness of space and getting lost. Not much to do, but still at least playable.\n\nSo yeah, keep an eye on this one.

It is in early stage, yes, graphics is ..similar to Freelancer actually.. yet you can freely fly through space, clean up pirate scum, obliterate their filthy dens, shoot asteroids - mine ores - sell ores, use space lanes for fast travel and a lot more I suppose. Games on Kickstarter, you can choose to support it.  I did, let's see. There are tons of ideas yet to be implemented and I hope it will be considered by devs. After all it should be, at least for me, mix of realism, fun, economy, story, challenge, customization.... Don't worry about Cry Engine like graphics that might come. This needs not to be the goal. This does not count.

It is playable, and I enjoy doing the little quests and raiding some pirate ships (got balls m8?). It is difficult to write a concrete review complete with pros and cons as by the time somebody reads this, the features will have already been updated as the developer is CRAZY at work on this thing. That being said, I won't write many cons, as most the cons are either bug related and should go in the forums, or are planned to be fixed in the future.\n\nSo, some things I really liked are that the controls are relatively simple to pick up. They are really similar to the controls in StarMade, except MUCH easier and smoother. The weapon section in the market isn't implemented yet, but you still have 3 weapons to start with, excluding a mining laser. There is a short range rapid fire laser, a mid-range slower firing laser, and a long range and powerful sniping laser (I find it effective at taking out pirate ships from a distance).\n\nSome things I didn't like (these do not include the bugs or things that I am aware of that are being worked on) is how every life you lose just seems disposable. Unless you bought a ship, dying just doesn't have that big of a consequence that I can feel. And speaking of the ships, whenever you die, the ship you are piloting (excluding the default ship) is removed permanently from your possession until you buy another one. This almost makes the entire idea of buying ships rather redundant in my opinion. If i grind for something, I'd like to keep it. I don't know, maybe there are some fans of systems like that found in Realm of the Mad God, where a death resets your character, but I am not one of them.\n\nOther than that, I had, and plan to have, fun with this game in the future. Community is a little small but really die hard and passionate for the game, and the developer 10x that. It may not look like much now, but it's $2.99 right now. That's cheaper than a large drink at the McDonald's in our town. Why not give it a shot?","January 11","true","11.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

While it's not exactly Star Citizen, graphically, most developers tend not to care about fps at all, and that usually ends up with decent rigs getting absolutely destroyed. Not here. Getting 170 fps, the graphics are also prettyyyy decent.\n\nProblem: There is not a lot to do. But the devs are working hard and are really dedicated, and I think this game is gonna get fantastic.","April 26","true","0.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

As far as I managed to figure out you shoot asteroids ore spawns you run into it go to the nearest station sell it do nothing with your money, and maybe kill things(crashed trying to kill some unnamed thing with 10k health) I would not recommend buying in its current state unless its on sale\n\nMostly what this game needs is more players both to support the dev and to build the community\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPros+\n+ Looks decent graphically and there are plans to improve\n+ Also plans for a new engine\n+ Controls are actually pretty good\n+ Devs seem active, friendly and answer questions swiftly\n+ Theres a suicide button\n+ If all promises are met this game will be great\n+ Very open world worth exploring\n+ Dynamic economy(prices fluctuate based on how much ore is sold to particular stations)\n+12 or so ships, with possible plans for more\n\nNegatives-\n- Not much to do besides mine, sell ore, and shoot things\n- Money doesnt seem to have any use yet\n- The UI is currently missing ingame options and a few other more minor things\n- Few people online (but growing and those Ive seen are pretty friendly)\n- Switching to a new engine may slow the addition of more content/features\n\nWill update this as updates to the game happen","April 19","false","2.3"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","1"

The content that is actually there is good and seems to be going somewhere. First time playing the game with three friends and we were stuck on it for 2 hours just messing around and not actually mining anything or fighting each other but instead just exploring random asteroid belts. The map size is pretty big to say this is early access and the combat system isn't bad either but the only problem with the game is its lack of content which is perfectly understandable right now because again its early access and pretty much coming up to its alpha stage (Even Minecraft started like this, anybody remember that?)\n\nIn conclusion, this game is definintely worth the price and you'll be saving yourself a bit of money when this game is finished and starts picking up momentum. All games start like this and eventually rise up to become the supergiants they are today, so don't miss out!","October 11, 2015","true","4.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Because this game is in single hands it will take longer for content to be added over the course of time although faster than you could expect. The game itself is endless in places to go but players are fewer than you would expect, as time goes along and it gets closer to launch I can almost gaurentee that this problem will fix itself. I definatly recommend getting this game -especially with a friend or two- at least before it comes out of it's early access stages, as this is a more affordable title.","February 9","true","42.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's not complete, it crashes, it has exploits, it has bugs, it has issues.  If you don't want to help make it better or want to spend you hard earned money on a finished product, don't buy this game.\n\nAlso know that this game has everything going against it.  A failed kickstarter, a single developer, and a game engine most people haven't heard of.  This is reason enough to simply avoid buying it.  I took a chance on it after hearing how involved the developer was - and every review that points this out is absolutely correct.  Dex is on ALL.  THE.  TIME.\n\nIf you want to see the developer ACTIVELY engaging players every day, getting feedback, revealing the short and long term plans, the ideas put into the game, then this is what you want.  Dex is super involved and the community is supportive of new players.  He has a Herculean work ethic, and that is why I'm glad to have bought the game - to support a developer who is passionate and consistent.\n\nAs for the game itself, there isn't a lot to do.  Blow up pirates, their hideouts, mine, PVP, complete missions, and explore around.  Only 2 tiers of spaceships are available at this time.  Combat feels soft, mining requires flying over chunks of asteroid to pick them up, and there's no customization to anything.  The list is long and changing all the time.\n\nIt's getting better, it's growing fast, and it's going to be a great product.

I have read alot of the reviews and I think many forget this game is still in PRE-ALPHA. For a game this new I have to say the Dev is doing an amazing job!  Very rarely do I write anything about the the Devs but many have commented to me ingame that his love for this game, willingness to listen to new ideas and interaction with its fans is event as soon as you logon. I have watched him continue to answer everyone's questions time after time and even guide people through the ever expanding galaxy which is getting bigger every day. Although I dont know him personaly, I have never seen a game where the Dev takes a personal interest like this and its very commendable.\nAs for the game itself, The graphics are very well done and vibrant especially the planets. The combat in this game is top-notch especially for pre-alpha! Strafing and free movement (Ship follows mouse) makes this game so much fun for PVP or just guiding the ship around planets or astroids. The new ships of different kinds and strengths (Mining, combat and transport) continue to get the community excited for whats coming next.  Warp Speed or Hyper Jump as many call it makes the game very realistic and moving from one area to the next can be done with ease. Grouping with friends for fun dogfight PVP, doing mining or just exploring by yourself for new stations and hidden astroid belts for mining is addicting. Honestly I cant wait for the new updates and for the full version.

I guess you could say this is good? The game has one thing going for it and I mean this is what should be focused on THE FLYING AND STYLE OF THE GAME I LOVE IT, please don't get rid of the super cool plane/space jet thingy designs!\n\nNow the bad I mean again like I said before that game only has resolution options, full screen and windowed... eh I don't know. The game right now is BORING mine, mine, mine... on top of that the tutorial seems broken because I can't finish it AND the steam achievements don't seem to work either.  THE GAME HAS NO OTHER OPTIONS aside from selecting English and disabling/enabling the tutorial... there is no audio sliders nothing nope! I feel like as the years go by the more I find myself using the windows volume mixer just because it seems like no one can get audio options right! It's either too loud, too quiet or no options at all.\n\nNow I know I seem a little harsh but I do know that it's only $0.99 USD and I picked it up for $0.50 USD so I can easily give this a pass, it's only one guy working on it by the looks of things so to get this far alone it seems great. I'll be honest I don't think I'll come back to this game unless I see more improvements I REALLY DO hope you focus on the flying physics, style and combat because that's the fun part... not mining please, please for the love of life not mining!","December 9, 2015","true","0.4"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","1"

I have played the game for all of 15 minutes and already shut the game down and asked for a Refund.  First off, there is no actual login system and if you mess up on your Username (Mind you, no password) you cannot log in or someone else can easily log into your account.  Once in, I had the unfortunate experience of dealing with the Tutorial System in which is very basic, the voice is EXTREMELY annoying and you can only go so far before you cannot complete the rest of the tutorial.\n\nIt is very easy to get blown up if you are in the wrong section of the game and there are literally NO warning signs or even direction in the game.  Last night when I logged in, their Dev _Dex actually started to fire at me and proceeded to try and blow me up multiple times.  I was able to take him out first but that is NOT how you want to introduce your game to someone.... Sure, I see a new person... Lets blow him up and not even talk to anyone while doing it or even ask before engaging.  THEN HE WAS EXTREMELY UPSET AFTER I BLEW UP HIS SHIP!!!!  Really!?!?!?\n\nPros:\n* Easy to setup account and play\n* Easily get to areas of the galaxy\n* No one other than NPCs to shoot at you.\n\nCons:\n* Annoying Tutorial Lady's Voice.\n* Takes a while to accumulate any value of money (Yes, I know... Played for 15 minutes).\n* Wander outside starting station within 15 lightyears and a volley of weapons fire attacks you, destrying you in 2 seconds.\n* Devs do NOT talk to you at all in game, show up and try to blow you up with their L337 ship.\n* UI is very basic and looks like a child built it (Is actually hard to use by the way).\n* Game Controls are horrible.\n* Direction System is very lacking in the fact that you literally have no idea where your at unless you use those trade lanes.\n* No escape function on keyboard or a Log Out/Exit Button in game.  Need to EndTask or click X on game window.\n\nAll-In-All, this game has SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO much to refine before actually being released that it isnt funny.  The tutorial system and menu ui need to be tweaked badely and there just needs to be a complete overhaul unfortunately before it will be a good game to play.  This game will not have my support as long as it is in its current and almost unbarible state of gameplay.","May 26","false","0.3"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

Together as a community we are stronger so why nto become part of one?\n\nI suggest...no I challenge you to buy this game and meet me in space, shoot me down in cold blood and then tell me you didn't enjoy it.","June 2, 2015","true","1.9"," 18 of 40 people (45%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","45","18","40","3","0"

Then this happens.\n\nYou play for about 5 mins and notice that well nothing works, the UI doesnt work the tutorial stops right at sell all of your mined minerals and then thats it... Few people log on go through the first 4 mins then log off because well nothing works. It runs smooth plays nice but uhhh where the hell is the game? It seems like the developer is broke, he has some problems with "stolen" keys apparently... he can't pay for the server and there doesnt seem to be any content update.  This looks more like a hobby than a game developer. So much potential here... O well i guess another one bites the dust.\n\nNow i understand this is early access but honestly to pay for this is nothing short of robbery. should be somethine like Pre-order help support the dev and get a 5 min preview of the game honestly.

It has a quest system but can't access it (due to UI being buggy), if they fix the questing system and add alittle more enemies so that its not repetitive the game play will be alot better.\n-UI is buggy as hell, I would open a menu up only to find it empty. Another problem i found is when i open the inventory i have it half way through the tabs and nothing show up as well.

I'm open to early access games, but this is little more than some poorly modeled assets thrown together. I got some sort of strange black circle around a star, clipped through asteroids, and played through a poor voice-only tutorial. No subtitles or on-screen text, and no guidance on what anything is. Tutorial covers different classes of weapons, but doesn't indicate which are which. Then came some attempts at mining. At first, I found in strange that all the rocks that spawned off the asteroid looked the same, so I turned to get a different angle on them. Turns out, you can't even turn your ship in the same space as the rotational point is not the center of the ship. The rocks still looked the same-that's when it hit me, they're 2D sprites! Somehow, in the 12 years since Freelancer, Rene Marcel Dirks has found a way to reverse the trend of improving graphics. You'd be much better served playing Freelancer, you could probably find a more populated server. I tried to find a way to exit the game, but there's not even a menu!\n\nCoupled with now being worked on by one person, development will be moving along slowly.\n\ntl;dr: Avoid, try Elite: Dangerous, or X3:AP if you want a Freelancer experience.

Forum, server, and game is now lifeless. This game is server dependent  to even log in and it is nonoperational. I've only refunded 2 games on steam before. Sadly (despite the Freelanceresque description) there is nothing here to play.\n\nEdit: I wouldn't be this harsh if I didn't feel like I stepped into an absolute mess when I bought it. Looking at the reviews, it definitely seems like something was here at one point. But in the end, (after a ton of research) you will find lots of dev drama, with no thought of a LAN feature.  Shooting for the mmo was a crumbling mistake.  This game could be saved with a dedicated function.  Give up the mmo dev fame complexity, and build it the way it was meant to be.\n\nIncome is way better.","November 17, 2015","false","0.2"," 4 of 16 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","4","16","0","0"
