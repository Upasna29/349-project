A big part of the game is the creation of your party from the available characters since each character has different attributes which will change the way you approach the game ---- so the replay value is very high. (especially if you are wanting to unlock all the achievements.)\n\n\nThe artwork is beautifully done, the music adds a lot to the atmosphere of the game, and the gameplay itself is flawless.\n\n\nThere are a great many items to find and spells to use and learn so you need to explore the game very carefully to find everything. Each world (presented in a maze like style) will tell you how many enemies need to be defeated, and once defeated, they do not reappear. Defeat them all for big bonuses.\n\n\nSo there is great fun to be had here with lots of replay that will keep you busy for many hours. Give this one a try, and you will be drawn into a game that is a bit of a variation on the old style rpg experience that is familiar, and very appealing.\n","July 13, 2015","true","6.7"," 66 of 77 people (86%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","86","66","77","4","0"

Takes place in unique settings from planes, to trains, and city streets for example.  The goal is to rescue the girlfriend, after doing that the goal is to rescue whoever else is kidnapped by the bad guys.  Lots of party members to choose from makes each playthrough feel new.  Levels all have unique monsters that fit the level.  There are unlockable characters by beating different modes in different ways.  With the levels just the right size this game is great to speedrun, even better on higher difficulties where the characters move speed becomes super fast!  Great replay value!\n\nThere is no manual for the game that explains ANYTHING in the game or what skills do, or describes any of the stats.  Apparently some of that info is in a separate guide players can buy somewhere online, but even that doesnt include the details of what party members do what people say.  Only way to find a good party is to experiment around and see what works best, or just charge in blindly!   There is also no way to play full screen, hitting alt enter leaves those annoying black bars on every side meaning 30-40% of the screen is just black.  Its un noticable as the heat of battle kicks in though.  WIthout a manual its not a perfect 10 but its so close otherwise from great music to great replay value its a fun RPG to kill time with and change things up from the usual.\n\nRating:  8/10  Value:  $4.99","July 29, 2015","true","38.9"," 40 of 49 people (82%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","82","40","49","3","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/StopMuroTime/recommended/332400/","StopMuroTime","Muro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/StopMuroTime/","196 products in account","POSITIVES:\n\n+ Absurd concept which throws you right into action (I'll go talk to my crush over ther- KIDNAPPED BY A NINJA)\n+ Cheesy setting (let's say this lasts for the first 3 chapters out of 8)\n+ Renaming your protagonist/girlfriend/party members. Allows some chuckles when you name them after friends or such.\n+ I wanted to say "choices", but...\n\nNEGATIVES:\n\n- The *illusion* of choices. Game starts with asking for both your own and your crush's gender, seemingly allowing any combination. Straight/gay dude/chick? Technically you can choose whatever - but no matter what you pick, you will be playing a dude rescuing a girl.\nSimilarly, at the team-collecting stage you are asked if you want to go on the adventure alone - but when you pick the "yes" for that, you character goes "nah" and you are forced to gather a party anyway. This wouldn't be in negatives if these questions were never present, but the illusion of choice here is more disappointing than the lack of it would be.\n\n- That cheesy setting from positives? Eventually goes stale when the game apparently gives up half-way and instead of being creative with enemies, it just keeps throwing more variants of Asian warriors at you and calls it a day.\n\n- Lack of manual or a way to rebind keys. This results in having to go through trial-and-error to figure out all keys, some of which aren't the most obvious (like in party creation renaming your characters from the default name requires a backspace - which is bound to the Insert key of all things).\nNo manual means you'll also have a limited idea of how in-game stats work and affect your effectivity. This can be "fixed" with getting the paid guide dlc - which isn't exactly a thing one would give a Plus for.\n\n- Annoying mechanics in the quality-of-life department.\nExample 1) With hunger, game doesn't check when you last ate, but rather when you last stopped being hungry. This makes it common to heal a character with 3 pizzas, only to a few moments later hear him say "I'm hungry bro, got any pizza?"\nExample 2) Red toros are a +50exp consumable. You find dozens and hundreds of them, but can only consume one at a time, each requiring the "worldmap -> menu -> items -> ok -> scroll down to toro -> pick toro -> pick party member -> ok -> automatic return to worldmap" sequence.\n\n- Questionable difficulty, aka the reason I gave up and dropped the game. The game saves every 5 fights, and my party is currectly encountering ninjas in packs of few per fight. Each ninja takes 1-2 rounds to be taken down, and each can one-hit kill a party member if he feels like it. All that despite having my party members using best weapons and armor I could find and buy, actively trying to play the game in a smart way, and all this on "easy mode" (!) at that.","January 15","false","9.2"," 37 of 46 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","37","46","2","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/drpixel/recommended/332400/","drpixel","DrPixel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/drpixel/","3726 products in account","Girlfriend Rescue is perhaps one of the dumbest and most simple RPGs ever. It has nothing particularly special about it – it's made with RPG Maker, the story is laughably silly, and the gameplay is pretty much what you'd expect from a typical turn-based RPG. So, why am I recommending it? Well, read on and find out!\n\nThe BreakdownThe game “combines the atmosphere of Streets of Rage with the gameplay of Dragon Quest”, according to the store page at least. The gameplay might be a little different than Dragon Quest, but the bit about Streets of Rage is pretty much spot on – this is clearly a silly game with a silly premise. I mean, the name says it all!\n\nPerhaps one of the funniest parts about the story though is that the girl you're trying to rescue from the bad guys (ninjas, of course!) isn't actually the main character's girlfriend. Instead, she's just some random girl that the guy has a crush on. He decides to team up with 3 of 13 (4 of those are unlockables)  characters/friends to stop the bad guys. Personally, I found the character designs for the party members to be pretty amusing. My party consisted of the main dude, a shady-looking “dealer” character, a little boy, and a frog. Yep, a frog. Each of the characters have amusing dialogue occasionally, yet what truly sets them apart from each other is their strategies during battles.\n\nSee, the gameplay of Girlfriend Rescue basically consists of a series of battles in a set area. The game throws you into a series of areas linked together by an overall location (like say, a line of train cars in a train). In these, you fight a variety of enemies, collect items by walking into objects (yeah, it's weird), and manage your party through equipping gear or using consumables like pizza, drugs, or “red toro” (Red Bull). The battles themselves are pretty much what you'd expect: turn-based attacks, skills, defending, and whatnot. Each character has their own special skills (sometimes with silly names) that sometimes apply status effects to enemies; certain weapons can also do this.\n\nNow, a somewhat minor complaint I had is that it was a bit difficult to remember what most of these status effects actually do. There's a LOT of them – quite a bit more than most RPGs – and it became tough to try and remember what would happen if an enemy “infected” one of my party members, made them “tired”, “doomed”, etc. There's police officers NPCs that can be found every once in a while and explain about a few status effects, but it would be nice to have a help section or even just an item that gives little text blurbs about each status effect as a quick refesher.\n\nAnother part that bugged me about Girlfriend Rescue was how repetitive it got after a while. Each “world” was basically the exact same – slap on a fresh new coat of paint for the scenery and enemies, fight a bunch of enemies in a mostly linear path, then rinse and repeat. There wasn't a lot of variety besides the pixel art, different songs for different worlds, enemy designs, and bosses. Speaking of bosses, they were pretty much incredibly easy, or at least all the ones that I fought were. I would have gotten farther, but.....well......\n\n….the difficulty. This game has really strange difficulty spikes. At the beginning of the game, it recommends you play on Easy for a first playthrough, which I found a bit odd, so I decided to be rebellious and pick Normal. Now, for most of the game I had a good challenge, but it was nothing too tough. For the first few worlds, my characters rarely died at all. Yet, when I reached the 4th world, I kept dying to the enemies of that area, zombies. It wasn't too much, but it was definitely a noticeable difference in difficulty from the previous areas. The weird part though is that the 5th area was one of the easiest for me – I beat the boss (or rather 2 bosses) quite quickly and the enemies were similarly a breeze. However, the 6th location......oh jeez. It began simple enough: a town with snakes. So what? Well, it turned out to be extremely difficult, to the point that my characters were all either dying or nearly dying after every battle. Those damn snakes were crazy hard, and the weird part is that the difficulty spike sort of came out of nowhere – I had great equipment and a decent combo of powerful fighters and spell casters at that point. So, I don't really understand why that area was so incredibly challenging for pretty much no reason. Eh, oh well.\n\nAnyway, why might I be recommending this game then? To be honest, I think a lot of it was how charming I found the game to be. The story made me laugh at its silliness, and pretty much everything about the game was dumb. Yet, the game embraced its stupidity and just sort of went with it. I love it for that. Yeah, it's clearly not amazing – the repetitive nature of the gameplay limits it quite a bit. For a silly little RPG Maker game though? Not bad, not bad at all!\n\nProsCharming, silly story about teaming up with some goofy characters to rescue your "girlfriend" from a secret conspiracy involving ninjas, zombies, and much more!\nBattles can involve a decent amount of strategy (skills, status effects, etc.)\nLots of options in terms of equipment, items, and party members (you can choose 3 of 9, along with 4 unlockable ones)\nAbout 6-10 hours long (from what I can tell), though the incentive to try different character combinations and unlock new characters adds the option for extra replayability\nSprite art and character designs are quite nice\nMusic is a little generic and cheesy, but it's interesting and not too repetitive usually\nHas Steam achievements, trading cards, and cloud support\nConsGameplay can get a bit repetitive after a while - definitely play in short bursts!\nThe story isn't really serious, so if you're looking for one, this may not be the game for you\nThe game has random difficulty spikes about halfway through (the 4th and especially the 6th world)\nGirlfriend Rescue is a strange mix of a charming and silly atmosphere mixed with slightly repetitive "beat up all the bad guys" turn-based gameplay. Sure, it has its fair share of problems, but overall this is a great addition to anyone's library. If you're not a fan of RPGs or RPG Maker games, it may not appeal to you, but for those who enjoy a silly story and a good ol' fun RPG, I think you may quite like this one.\n\nFinal Verdict: 7.5/10","May 5","true","5.2"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","18","19","0","0"

As a result, I don't consider this to be a full review.\n\nIt's possible that my review will change as I progress further into the game, but so far I'm not impressed.  Before I continue, a little about me.  I've been working with different versions of RPG Maker since the late 90s.  In fact, even now I'm working on an RPG Maker VX title that I will hopefully submit on Steam at some point, though that is easily months away from now.  That said, I have a number of issues with this title.\n\nAlmost everything reeks of generic.  The main character is not interesting, nor are any of the side characters.  The dialogue really needs to be entirely redone as it's very amateurish and riddled with multiple grammatical errors that I would overlook if they were attempting to parody other grammatical errors from other games, but clearly they are not.  There are a lot of subtle issues with the game as well.\n\nFor starters, barely pressing in one direction in a menu will often cause my cursor to go crazy and skip several lines or just straight up go into hyperdrive.  This has caused me to run from battles where I meant to go into rush instead.  While the graphics are entirely custom, the characters and environments are pretty terrible and low res in general, which makes the game feel that even further cheapened.\n\nI mean, I get it...the sheer number of normal Steam users that complain and drone on about default RTP for RPG Maker more or less forces you to use custom everything and that's fine, but at least make it something halfway appealing and BETTER than the default.  It also doesn't help that certain things went unchecked.  For example, when you stumble upon a merchant, you have the option to deal or not.  If you select not to, it still brings up the shop menu.\n\nThese are things that should have been ironed out WAY before release.  As I said, it's possible that I will enjoy it more as time goes on (the opening cutscene was pretty nice for example), but as it stands this comes off more bland and unappealing than I had anticipated.","August 14, 2015","false","0.8"," 37 of 59 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","37","59","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/morphicmetal/recommended/332400/","morphicmetal","morphicmetal","http://steamcommunity.com/id/morphicmetal/","3528 products in account","Product received for free\n\nGirlfriend Rescue is a turn/round-based RPG through and through which starts out with a conversation among friends about approaching your crush, but you find out that some recently escaped prisoner has taken her!  You have to form a party to find a way to save her.  You start out with choices you can make about your gender, name, crush’s name, and once you can move around, you have a selection of up to two other members you are friendly with that can help you out as you start your quest to get your girl back.  I would have liked to have been able to try them all to find out what each possible party member could do, but I would not really know future abilities as they leveled up anyway, so it is probably not a very important issue.\n\nAs you begin, you get a lot of nice tips from the local police NPCs on various aspects of play.  This was helpful for me as I began journeying around.  There are a lot of various original things about this RPG game that I like, such as the various debuffs and what can change when things happen.  They are atypical to what I am used to seeing, which is pretty interesting and refreshing to me.  I mean, a lot of it involves various stats, so it’s not too different, but the way it is done is not the typical type of stuff.  I like what I’ve encountered so far in this game.  The combat system is a standard turn-based style where you have attack and defend commands along with special moves you can learn as you level up, which you pick for the next round, and watch the round unfold.\n\nThe actual gameplay outside of combat is roaming around a map, trying to find X amount of enemies on the area you explore, and taking out the last guy on the map.  I have not tried finishing an area with less than the target number, but I am guessing your bonus reward at the end would change if you got less than the number it shows, which finalizes after the last “boss” character on the map, as far as I can tell, ever since the first area I explored fully.\n\n\nPros\nThe plot is different, and I find the initial gameplay and overall setting nicely done.\n\nThe look of the areas so far work with what’s going on at the paticular time.  Fits in nicely.\n\nSince you can only pick limited characters for each run through the game, there is some replay value with this to find out what other characters are about, and which combinations might work the best on a harder difficulty, for instance.  I haven’t finished to see if there is a new game plus, and what that entails exactly, but there is definitely some replay value here in some way shape or form, which I always like!\n\nI am always happy when I can be rewarded with items for exploring around.  Most stuff seems to be added to inventory automatically when you are on the proper square or area, so it makes it a bit easier not having to mindlessly press buttons to click each spot.  Some boxes do require a click, but they are usually obvious.\n\nThe various combat mechanics in the special moves are very different than the standard RPG type of moves.  I really like the originality that is put into many of my party’s special techniques.\n\nThe status effects are not standard to RPGs either, and the originality is nice to see.  While most just lower stats in a few areas or stop you from moving, etc. they are not your typical “paralyze” or whatever.  Some will have a chance to go away after a turn or so, while others can last a bit longer.  They have interesting debuff names and the debuffs are generally not the typical types of effects.  Usually seems to be a series of stats that are lowered for most I have encountered so far.  Some will persist until you cure it, like hunger for instance.  There are a good many battle stat debuffs, and they have various different things they change or lower on your characters.\n\nBy clearing areas and dispatching every enemy there, you gain a special bonus, which carries over to the next areas.  You also get several items, which I haven’t tried comparing yet to unfinished area bonuses.\n\nAutosaves after five battles have gone by.\n\nWhile it doesn’t affect things too terribly much, the hunger aspect lowers stats a bit in certain areas.  I like the addition of needing to eat as you travel.\n\n\nCons\nVery linear gameplay.  While I don’t expect anything like a total open world experience, I would like more choice, and the possibility of returning enemies to grind if I wanted to do so.  One aspect I enjoy on RPGs that I miss here.\n\nIf I level up with items, I am unable to see what improves.  I can only see this directly when I win battles and level up.\n\nSome of the items are not very clear as to what they do, or are buggy.  Some don’t seem to work the way they should.  The Red Toro is supposed to counter Tired status, but it remains on the alien I try to use it on, but works on other characters.  Another character was Infected, and Cortisol never works for removal of this.  It might only work when actually in battle, but I haven’t really tried and compared this to being out of battle, where it doesn’t change the status effect while on characters.\n\nNear the beginning, when I am first able to choose my party, it would be nice to be able to see what each one is capable of.  Maybe being able to switch out at various times if I wanted to just try others instead of needing to start over and try them a while.  Of course, with no grinding, this would probably not be advantageous unless they took the same level as the character they were switched out for, since you wouldn’t get as many experience points for the three you would mainly use, and they would be spread out too much, which would cause an imbalance in the parity that exists in a limited battle grind-free style environment..\n\nI love a good map, even on something I consider a bit linear.  Good to know where I am.\n\n\nConclusionIs the game worth the $4.99 USD price tag to pick up?  Probably.  I think with the replay value, and the decent length of the game so far among other things, that alone is worth it.  The combat has some interesting abilities and the buffs and debuffs are not your ordinary stuff, for the most part.  I’m the type that likes to get games on sale, so I’d pick it up on a deal, but saying that, this game is definitely worth the price it is at, and I am surprised it does not carry a higher base price, honestly.  It’s a good one for the RPGMaker style engine.  I can highly recommend this game after my fairly limited gameplay thus far.","May 18","true","7.6"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

Sounds simple? It is - but the value of GR lies in its complexity and variability.\nThere are multiple levels - streets,  secret labs, train, etc. Each of these levels feels unique, with different looks, enemies and music themes. For completing a level, you receive a reward in a form of bonus (more damage for certain weapons, better healing and so on). The better the level completition, the better the reward. Once earned bonuses carry into new games, so it's a good idea to play GR more than once.\n\nThe battles are turn-based and require lot of different strategies. Sometimes the enemies can be paralyzed or poisoned, sometimes brute force is the best solution. Some spells are also placement-based (hit enemies on the left), so enemies positions matter, too.\nResources are limited, both supplies and enemies, so you can't "over-level" the game. And healing is very costly, plus you don't get the best bonuses if you use it. Depending on bonuses, party and items, you regenerate a bit of health (and "magic") after each successful fight. Similarly as in Dreamscape, it makes the right party composition and strategy  crucial.\nEasy difficulty is good for testing the characters and viable parties, because Normal and Hard are simply not doable with "wrong" party. And the harder modes (unlocked by fully completing Hard) are only possible with multiple bonuses. GR is definitively a challenging game.\n\nThe levels are relatively straightforwards - no sidequests, no "turning-back" (i.e. you can't return to a level once you completed it), but there are still many well-hidden items and you usually discover something new in each playthrough. Overall, I enjoyed the complexity of the game. There are just so many party and bonuses combinations. And each of these influences your playing style. And thanks to its fast-pace, it feels pretty addictive. There's certainly the "complete one last level" feeling to it. And after completing all the levels, it's "do it better and on higher difficulty."\nOn top of it, the setting (gangsters, cops, agents, ...) felt pretty refreshing from the usual "Dragons and Elves" thing. GR is a must in my book.","July 13, 2015","true","8.4"," 21 of 33 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","21","33","0","0"

I received this game for free, however, my review is unbiased\n\nThere is also a video counterpart to this review, which I highly recommend you check out.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjJueu0yUOo\nAnyway, onto the review. Girlfriend Rescue was developed by Aldorlea Games, was released on July 10th 2015 Girlfriend rescue is an indie RPG, which describes itself as a cross between Dragon Quest and Streets of Rage, however, my experience with the game feels more like diluted gameplay of Final Fantasy mixed with the urban setting of Streets of Rage. Girlfriend Rescue is an RPGMaker game, and those familiar with RPG Maker games know that they are not always the highest quality of games, for obvious reasons. Girlfriend Rescue is not an exception, however, compared to some of the other RPGMaker games I have played in the past, I quite enjoyed Girlfriend Maker.\n\nThe story to Girlfriend Rescue is about how the love of your life is kidnapped by a crime syndicate, and it’s up to you, and your friends, to save her.\n\nThe gameplay is my favorite part of the game. The combat is very enjoyable, and for casual RPG players, or those looking to spark an interest in the JRPG, or perhaps even seasoned JRPG enthusiasts looking for something a bit easier to play or to 100% achieve the achievements. Those looking for replay value Should not turn away from Girlfriend Rescue, since every playthrough you can choose A different party of characters, or equip different items and utilities.\n\nThe graphics for Girlfriend Rescue aren’t the greatest, however, they are decent and not too hard on the eyes. There are many hand drawn scenes in Girlfriend Rescue which are very visually pleasing. However, like every game, there are cons. One downside to Girlfriend Rescue which I Immediately noticed was the music.\n\nThe soundtrack to the game is composed solely of creative commons music. Now, you might be thinking, “Hey Deviation! You use NoCopyrightSounds in your videos, how does that make you any better?” Well, the simple truth is, I don’t make anyone pay to watch my videos, however, to play Girlfriend Rescue, you’re going to have to fork over some of your hard earned money.\n\nAnother downside to Girlfriend Rescue is the illusion of choice at the very beginning. Similar to Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team, although there are probably a lot more games that have the same beginning, Girlfriend Rescue will ask you a few questions. What’s your name, what sexuality are you, what gender, and if you have a crush or whatever you want to call it. However, after answering all of those questions, it does not have an outcome on your game. For example, me, being the funny guy I am, chose the option that I’m gay at the beginning of the game  (but I’m not in real life if you're wondering) , however, it still said that I was in love with the damsel in distress (Laura). I’m pretty sure that those who are homosexual only like those of the same gender, and since I was a male and homosexual, doesn’t that mean I’m only attracted to men? Yeah, I thought so. Check mate, game.\n\nThe final downside to the game is the odd theme. The first few levels make since, you're in an urban setting fighting off thugs and rats, however, as soon as you go into a very modern apartment building, you’re greeted by ninjas, samurai, and other Oriental themed enemies. Very strange, but not a huge downside. However, if you are a fan of old school JRPGs with an odd story, or if you are interested in indie games in general, I would recommend Girlfriend Rescue, however strange it may be, however, I would suggest you mute the audio and play whatever music you like, as I did.\n\nRating:\nGraphics: 7.2/10\nAudio: 3/10\nGameplay: 7.6/10\nOverall: 5.9/10\n\nEnjoy the review?

Its a JRPG that handles similar to old school Dragon Warrior or Final Fantasy, but with a bit more room for strategy in both building your party and combat. The story itself takes place in a modern, urban setting which is a breath of fresh air (ironically) as opposed to your typical medieval fantasies. There's an interesting variety of characters to construct your party with, to which you will use to trudge through the 8 different scenarios. Explore a bit, loot things, fight baddies, and continue onwards. At the end of each scenario you get a little piece of story that serves as a reminder in case you forgot what the game was all about (see: title), and then you go back to walking and mashing the X button.\n\nIts not the most fun I've had with one of these kinds of games, in fact I'm a bit disappointed in Aldorlea Games. After playing Deadly Sin 2 and Skyborn, I really expected more from this title. I only recommend it if you have absolutely no other RPGs to play.. or just really need that old school RPG fix, even then wait for a sale.\n\nPros:\n\n+ Interesting variety of characters\n+ Fresh, urban setting\n+ Fast paced combat\n+ Colorful visuals\n\nCons:\n\n- Mediocre story\n- Poorly written dialogue\n- Repetitive battles\n- Ugly enemy artwork\n- Vague character/skill descriptions\n- Messed up controls with my X360 gamepad\n- Lack of settings (volume, controls, etc)\n\n5/10","December 16, 2015","false","8.0"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

The battling in this game can get tedious, and the writing isn't particularly good, but those problems aren't so problematic that they ruin the experience. In my playthorugh I have enjoyed myself fighting the varied enemies, using the skills unique to each character, searching items for loot, and customizing my character's gear. The two biggest problems I have with the game is that combat grows repeteitive and boring if you play for more than an hour or two, and the fact that regardless of whether you put down your gender as male, female, gay or straight, you are always playing as a male character trying to save a woman, since the main character has no personality beyond wanting to save a the girl  (yeah, she's not actually your girlfirend yet, despite the name of the game)  I don't understand why your can't play as a female trying to rescue a man, or a homosexual female, or a male trying to rescue a male, all that it would have required was a skin change for the main character and a couple of alternate pieces of still art, if there was any animation or voice acting in the game then I would understand, but there isn't and the game asks you your gender and sexual preference at the beggining so I don't understand this decision. And as I mentioned, the main character has almost literally no personality, though the supporting party members make up for that somewhat, they actually have personalities, though those are all hilariously one dimensional. In the party from my playthough, I had a guy who kept on talking about working out, a girl who kept talking about cosplay, and a different guy who only ever talked about his "informants." there is something kind of funny about these characters, since none of them are actually crucial to the "plot" they can say whatever the writers wanted them to, and it shows. But in my opinion that just gives the game a bit of charm. The supporting party is also an interesting and unique take, at the beggining you chose three party members out of (I believe) nine who will be with you for the whole game. Each possible party member has their own completely unique collection of special attacks, which encourages replays to see all the different attacks. This might be more effective if there was any kind of animation in for the attacks, but there isn't any animation for any attacks. But the different special moves feel very different from each other, so this is forgivable. Visually the game is fine, it's got a cool retro thing going, and the colors in each level work well with each other, but overall it's boring. Nice looking, but boring. The soundtrack is nothing special either, most of the time it's inoffensive (althought the soudntrack in the first level got on my nerves really fast) so I wouldn't recommend it on that criteria. Overall this game is slightly above average, it's better than a lot of indie retro RPGs that get put out, but at the same time there are much better titles out there. If you find this on sale, or if you just want the indie game equivalent of a B-Movie revenge flick then this probably worth checking out.\n6.5/10","April 29","true","3.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Your girlfriend in particular is gorgeous and definitely gave me an incentive to go after her (in Easy mode because I'm not demented, in love maybe but demented I'm not)\n","July 28, 2015","true","3.3"," 8 of 16 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","8","16","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mirvake/recommended/332400/","mirvake","StFeenix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mirvake/","333 products in account","Product received for free\n\nSHORT VERSION\n\n8/10\n\n+ Skills\n+ music\n+ finding items without pressing action key\n+ CC on bosses, and most other mobs.\n+ Silly game\n+ linear stages\n\n- Healing items.\n- Artwork could have been a bit better\n- Hunger\n- Many mobs gave you bleeding, or poison status, or both. Was a bit frustrating.\n\nLONG VERSION\n\nWhen I first saw this game, I was a bit doubtful; story didn't interest me too much and I used to play medieval/fantasy or sci-fi rpgs and this was (kinda) present time in normal world. But I decided give it a try, and glad I did that! Game was hilarious and I kept laughing thro playtime. (It could had something to do late hours I played tho) Character's classes were silly and their skills were ridiculous, suited users perfectly.\n\nAnd overall, I enjoyed this game, more than I thought I would.  It was very linear, different from most games I've played, not much room to exploring (and getting lost) but its fine once in a while. Game also was challenging at some parts, due no item-, money- or levelgrinding and NPC heals weren't available so often. And you couldn't save when you wanted, if you didn't feel like backtracking a lot. I got couple close-calls, and one wipe at boss fights ("Just one more hit, I don't have to heal yet, just one more hit and.. oh, thats a critical hit.. daymmmn.), even when I was playing easy mode. Annoying healing items and dots were difficult to handle in some fights. Luckily stuns, blocks, charms etc. worked quite well with +SKI gear, it did take some points from damage output and defence tho, but at least I wasn't wiped out on first turn.\n\nMusic was nice, nothing mindblowing or epic, but it suited stage themes pretty well and gladly it was playing whole time, not just short moments. Story, what I didn't feel from beginning, began interest me after a while. Why would one kidnap a normal girl who is not a princess, lost heir of great mage or something like that. Had to know!\n\nLooting wihtout key was refreshing and I kept finding new items almost all the time, when I just stumbled to wall or something and DING find a new item.\n\n\nGame had few downsides tho, it was a bit disappointing that you couldn't turn story to girl saves her boyfriend, even when I got that impression when game asked name and sex. But it wasn't any gamebreaking ragecausing thing. Mobs didn't respwan at all and since I am a bit (well maybe more than just a bit..) levelgrinding fanatic who could spend hours and hours to overleveling characters, a brief moment I was disapointed about that. But that was just minor setback and I'm pretty sure thats just my personal crazyness in my playingstyle. And it was meant to be that way for various reasons.\n\nPerhaps artwork wasn't best what Aldorlea can offer but it wasn't too bad. I have seen much worst. *brrrrrh*. Hunger factor of game was most annoying thing in game, in my opinion. Had to waste healing items, because guys wanted a pizza. And speaking of the devil; healing overall was annoying as hell. Most items healed only xx% and maybe I didn't really get how it should work. Sometimes when my guys had only 11 hp left, healing back to surviving range was a pain, because all items seems to heal only xx% from remaining HP. There were couple items what restored some amount of hit points, but in my game those were precious and pretty rare. Or maybe I just didn't check every levels closely enough. Due lack of healing some levels were really challenging, had to do some wipe-grinding leveling once because I got defeated all the time and I just didn't have enough items to heal or satisfy characters hunger. I hate dots.\n\nBut yes, I did enjoy this game, it was funny, sweet and different what I've been playing before. Somehow whole game felt very.. well, that the creator really put heart to make this game. I think that is one reason why people likes Aldorlea games, including myself.\n\nAnd ps. please forgive my grammar and spelling mistakes, this is first review I write in English.","May 6","true","11.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

As for the “real world” setting, the contrived yet paper-thin plot gives several excuses to throw among enemies random stuff like zombies, medieval knights and Taoist monks just to recycle sprites presumably from other titles.\nThe combat itself quickly becomes a chore and most of the levels are particularly uninspired and repetitive (especially areas 4 & 5), with lame graphics and no different things to do other than fight. The characters are not interesting at all, and the writing is amusing in places, but substitutes the wittiness and charm from TBOL with slang and memes that quickly get old.\nI don't recommend buying this at full price, and even then just if you're a JRPG fanatic.","February 16","false","7.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

You spawn in a city and choose players, then you just go. No explanation. You just go. Battles in the first level (yes, I said level, there's no world to explore) of this game are just too easy. The lack of difficulty just made me not want to play this.\n\nAnd I realize not every RPG has to be super difficult like Dark Souls or that oldschool roguelike NetHack, but there should at least be some element of challenge to motivate me.\n\nThere are no random encounters. Some people really like this, but I'd prefer the surprise, which adds to the challenge in certain ways. The enemies just seem ridiculously stupid and thrown together.\n\nNow, graphics. Yes, I realize this is an RPGMaker game. I repeat: I REALIZE THIS IS AN RPGMAKER GAME. But the graphics are just bad even for an RPGMaker game. A few more colorful sprites or tiles would help me appreciate this more.\n\nNow, I'm not saying this is complete trash. I guess the aspect of hidden items gets people to explore. But there's not enough for me to want to explore. Plus a lot of the hidden items are the same.\n\nMaybe I'll go back to this game if I don't have anything else to do. But I just don't see the appeal now that I've played it, even though it caught my eye so long ago.","April 29","false","0.9"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I won't be finding out.\n\nThe only "Beat 'Em Up" aspect of the game is that your girlfriend gets kidnapped in Detriot. Other than that it plays out like a mediocre RPG maker game.\n\nThe opening dialouge was very stilted and oddly phrased. "I can only take three persons with me." It felt like it was ran from google translate into English.\n\nYou get to pick your party at the very beginning, but they never tell you who or what they are. Did I pick a bunch of fighters, or healers, or what? I don't know. There are no descriptions when picking your party, hell they don't even tell you their names.\n\nThere are no random encounters which is nice, but I only fought a whopping two battles, none of my party members had any skills and I decided that I have much better games to play than this. If I were hard up for a game to play, maybe I'd give it more of a chance.\n\nI don't have any anti-RPG maker bias, and I've played a few Adolera games before, but this one just seems half-♥♥♥♥♥ from the get-go.
