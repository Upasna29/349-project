There's far to few things to go in the game.  The map's pretty much the same as you cross it.  Literally 4 types of animals only.  Quests are broken where you can bulk on experience on some because you can repeat the same quests because they don't close off.\n\nPretty much its in this state of gameplay -\n\n1) make a character\n2) get Digger, Gardener, Worker and Chopper skills.\n3) get to level 3 to get additional Scholar & Taskmaster Perks.\n4) leave the settlement (if you call it that since the NPC's have you build their house scaffolds and then sit on their ♥♥♥ and do nothing)\n5) build a settlement of your own once you go about 2/3rds of the map and it actually lets you place one.\n6) Build a well, taskboard, farm/garden, commonhouse and 2 houses...\n7) have nothing else to do because that's basically the game in a nut sheel in its present state.\n\nThat took me a little over an hour to do...\n\nOn top of that , by the time I got a settlement (of sorts) built, all the NPC's had settled and my settlement had no settlers join it.   A settlement on the map that's npc built are pretty much nothing but a well, taskboard, the settlements leader's scaffold (that does'nt even make it to a house stage) and about 36+ NPC's that may be lucky to actually manage 2-3 scaffolds (that also don't make it to the house stage) and then spend the rest of the game sitting on the ground around the well like a family day picnic....\n\nThat's basically the game so far... so I can't recommend value atm vs content for the price.\n\n*Update* I was just banned by a forum moderator - I'm guessing the developer in regards to a reply I'd stated to someone's post.  The few early access developers I've had the misfortune of knowing have basically taken our money and ran.  I stated on a reply to a post that this had happened with other early access developers and I haven't - yet - seen any movement really forward with this project.  So his answer was to ban me from the discussions part of the community hub.\nNow, this is the first ban I've had from a discussions thread - ever - on Steam and I've been on steam a long long time.\nClearly this developer cannot handle criticism and clearly he doesn't answer questions on his own "questions" thread.  I've had 3 remain unanswered.\nI've lost any respect for this developer. It's a pity it's too late to refund, but hey.. Can't be helped","December 12, 2015","false","8.9"," 941 of 1,068 people (88%) found this review helpful 58 people found this review funny","88","941","1","58","50"

On one hand it does have a lot of potential, the developers seem to have the basics down, and they have updated the game with new content already. Said content is a bare minimum for what you'd call a 'game' and there really isn't more than about an hour's worth of stuff to do. Not to mention, there's always a chance these guys will do what I've seen other developers do and just take the money they make and abandon the project. Still, if you've got $10 to blow and want to take a small gamble to support these guys, go for it. If not, I'd recommend waiting a few updates to see if they follow through. They're claiming to be able to update the game monthly - look at their roadmap to see what they have planned. If they can manage it, it may become one of the best games on the market. If not, it'll just be yet another overly-ambitious project left to die.\n\nWhen it comes to that, my gut's telling me this project has around a 60% chance of succeeding.","November 28, 2015","true","4.8"," 233 of 268 people (87%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","87","233","268","8","3"

However, they're taking the sandbox survival genre in a whole new direction with their strong NPC-focus.

If you enjoy First person sandbox survival RPG's with a strong crafting base, then please read this review.\n\nPro's and Con's\n\nFirst Person Sandbox Survival RPG\n\n- A rewarding leveling system, where your choices influence your ability to construct a variety of building, affecting in turn what you can craft.\n- Mount and Blade type of atmosphere with animals, survival and settlement building thrown in.\n- Procedurally generated world, will the slaughter of bears never end  ?! mwahahahar...\n- The world regenerates, trees will grow over time, ores will reappear somewhere and animals respawn\n\n- A tad buggy.. some Animals will be invincible ( FLEE, run for your life, ... this bear isn't taking any damage ) but when you find a Wildberry bush that has an enormous amount of fruit to give you won't complain hahahah nomnomnom..\n- Some perks are ineffective, or rather do not give you the listed bonuses, such as Yager and Skinner.\n- So i've built a Settlement... but im rather alone.. /tumbleweeds... how do we attract people to our Settlement ? good question :P This is why I suggest starting at another Settlement and expand with them for now.\n- Framerate issues / Lag.  It's an issue for quite a lot of folks.  I will suggest you Choose "Fastest" for Video / Graphics options when you run the game.  Try removing the Bloom setting in game as well.\n\n\nFirstly.. choosing your beginning perks with the 20 points you get.. well, much can be said here, but i'll try to spare you some time.  I understand a lot of people will do w/e they like and discover what works for them. I've started several times myself in order to either dump a corrupt save and start again or retry new perks from the beginning. The faster you get exp the better imho ( in my honest opinion )\n\nI recommend starting with Chopper, Scholar & Scrivenr ( giving you a 25% exp bonus )\nYou will start at a random point on the map with an Axe, a sword and a torch. Allow me to give you some advice on where to go from here..  Look around and find a tree that is NOT near a bear hahahah... no seriously.. you need to make a bow and arrows..\n\nTAB opens your inventory and the one the left hand side you'll find tabs, the topmost tab is your inventory, pickup and place the axe in your left-most hand slot to equip it, close inventory with TAB again and press 2 to weild the Axe.  Walk over to the tree or Hold Left Shift while you move ( W,A,S,D ) towards it to run.  When you reach the tree a circle will appear for your aiming reticle signalling that you are in range to begin harvesting it.  Chop Chop Chop.. ( hold left mouse ) you'll notice the circle filling slowly... when it fills you will receive 1 Wood ( 2 x wood and chopping speed if you chose the Chopper perk ).\n\nWhen you've fulfilled your lumberjacking fantasies enough ( 6 wood is a good enough start ) you open your inventory again and pick the tab at the bottom for crafting, choose to craft on the right hand page without a bench and you turn wood into planks 1 wood = 5 planks = 1 self crafted wooden bow,  1 plank = 1 arrow etc, leave the arrows in your inventory while you are crafting more arrows and they will continue to stack to 20.\n\nPlace your new bow in the left slot and the arrows in the right slot and you are ready to hunt bears ( cackles maniacally )\nLets face it.. in this game there's no point hunting anything but the creature that gives you the most EXP.  Bears will give you 200 exp without any of the Scholar tree perks.  Press 2 to wield the bow, click ( or hold ) the RMB ( right mouse button ) to prepare the bow for firing in your other hand and hold RMB to arm an arrow and raise the bow. Now at this stage you can either click LMB to fire or unhold RMB to lower the bow thereby not wasting the arrow.  Alternatively you can use LMB holding down to ready the bow and release to fire the arrow, but you cannot lower the bow from this stance and save the arrow.\n\nFind a Settlement asap ( M to open map.. if it looks like a Chapel ( not a greek Pantheon ) run to it,  the faster you get there the sooner you can begin to take quests from the board, earning you gold and exp. I have personally not experienced any reputation / Fame increments from completing quests for the population, but i've been more of a wanderer around the map, searching for a perfect place to build my own settlement.\n\nNow you're ready to explore.. make a name for yourself in this world of infinite bears... will you become Master of the hunt, roaming the land and setting up rudimentary shelters to rest before you again set off to explore.. Or will you become Jack of all Trades, buying from towns, crafting their produce into something better to resell again elsewhere. Or an owner-builder taking a piece of land for yourself and establishing a Settlement, building it the way you see fit. ?\n\nEither way this game is certainly a great way to spend your days, immersed in the survival, crafting and hunting. Pick it up and see for yourself\n\nIn this Early Access state I give it a 6 / 10.  The more content and patches it receives, the better.\n\nGood luck out there, may the wilderness be gentle with you ^_^\n\n","March 9","true","21.2"," 77 of 88 people (88%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","88","77","88","9","4"

I bought this to get a fresh game to check out, fully aware it would not be a finished game. This game is nothing more than a standard survival engine clad in some relatively simple graphics, with a very few types of npc's moving around. This game is FAR from any level where you can take money from people and expect them to be happy about it. I hope this game is playable the next time I check it out.

I will update this review when I have more time-\n\n\nMy experiences thus far:\n\nSpawned\nWalked up to a ruin\nWalked into Chivville\nTalked to Khepri (leader of the town)\nTold me to go to ruins to explore\nExplored the ruins\nCame back\nCannot turn in quest as it is bugged for now (fixed)\nbuilt a house\nHelped Khepri and Jovix cut down the forest north of town\nWatched as Khepri, Jovix, and 10 others cut down trees and built new buildings\nWent north to BaronVille\nFound the leader Komri (whats with the Ks?)\nTown had 40+ buildings and 100+ people and I hadnt done a thing here (which was awesome)\nWatched Baronville chop every forest around and proceed to build 15 more houses\nWent back to Chiville\nKilled Khepri\nChiville slowly died off\nBaronville now 200+ people and 100+ buildings\nKilled a bear (difficult)\nWent to a lakeside town called Chandri (15 people and 10 buildings)\nBought wood and sold berries for profit (they loved those berries)\nCame back to Baronville (now 250 people and 170 buildings)\nHelped to build 2 buildings\nWatched as Baronville slowly built up\nEnjoyed the view from a nearby mountain\nDecided I enjoyed this game\nSaved\nReviewed\n\n\nDeff worth a buy, also there is a indiego campaign going on where you can buy for 5 dollars and still support (I measure games in terms of 5 hours/dollar and this game will deff pay off) would suggest you buy it here or there.\n\nEDIT:\nNew Update fixes alot of bugs, next content patch expected in under a month. Dev has released a roadmap which explains a huge amount of future content. Time to gunho and keep on playing\n\nEDIT 2:\nThere is now a daily/bi-daily update branch to join for alot of the newer features for those less patient :D I plan to wait and play bi-update as to spread out my time more, worth a buy if you enjoy seeing games updated very often (check devlog in the forums of this game, will show all hes done)\n\nUPDATE:\nFinally played build 15 (I think the first build I played was 3? 5?) Here is how it went:\n\nSpawned\nWalked to a farm\nMet Kalridan the farmer/builder (why no bob?)\nhelped him plant crops\nWent into his house (NO LOADING SCREEN! TAKE THAT SKYRIM!)\nslept in his bed (dont worry I only touched him once I swear)\nWent to the town of Calradian (Cameldian? Camridian? Cama something and other?)\nHelped build a huge 2 story tavern (I mean huge)\nfound out that this building when finished lag spikes\nwent into the house (no loading screen but damn that 1-2 FPS hurts)\nwondered around drunk without drinking\nwent back up to 10-15 FPS\nwent upstairs\nslept upstairs\nwoke up to Krein the village idios hammering me (not what you think)\nSaved\nWrote this update\n\n\nTBH: it has improved ALOT, this game has a huge amount of promise and it gleams with possibility and shine. Getting this under 20 dollars is a steal as I see myself playing for 1k+ hours once everything is done (or perhaps before then lol) I dont have the beafiest of PCs and play it on the second highest GFX settings so people should have no problem :) all in all buy it/ (will update once a few more builds have passed)","October 24, 2015","true","12.1"," 40 of 51 people (78%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","78","40","51","12","0"

I don't know the rate at which the devs release updates but it doesn't seem to be quick enough, however unfortunate that is for them, I still have to say its not worth it right now.","March 2","false","1.4"," 44 of 65 people (68%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","68","44","65","6","0"

Not only that, but they have been very active and helpful while also being very open to new ideas proposed by the players. The "plan" for this game seems to be to make into a M&B type RPG with a more open-world focused on surviving and crafting. Honestly, it's an AWESOME concept.\n\nUnfortunately, it's just that. A concept. As it is, this game is riddled with gamebreaking bugs. Not to mention the moderate bugs that just annoy you. The combat is clunky and at the moment, downright horrible (though they claim they intend to make it much more interactive). Even on "fantastic" graphics settings, the models (NPCs, animals, etc.) in this game are ugly to look at, and there's not much variance in the climate/environment. The content right now is non-existent, and you'll maybe have 10-20 minutes of playtime before you get bored of glitchy bears, immortal citizens who walk by the bears unharmed, badly translated dialogue(Yes I understand it's a foreign game) and confusing leveling systems.\n\n\nI can't in good conscience recommend this game. It is on all accounts an unplayable game. Just like every other early access game, it's something that promises a lot, but fails to deliver on every account. What I can say is this: If the devs keep their work up, follow the road map, and continue to iron out the clunky/unpolished aspects of it, this game may be worth buying in 6-7 months time.\n\nLate February edit: This game has seen little to no progression and I stand by this review completely, and my review's complaints still stand. This game is still a don't buy.\n\nMay edit: Still little to no progression with the same content. Honestly I expected much more at this point. Still a no buy, still not anywhere near feeling complete. Each update on the roadmap has been delayed, and by this point they were supposed to be MUCH further then they've gotten.

I like the fact that this game cold go anywhere in the future the reason is that every time you load up a world it's like a new game you never know what your going to get so i also think there should be more quests than going to a ruin and looking at it. The reason this is set apart from other games is that unlike skyrim which you always load up the same game you get new landscapes everytime you load the game up and if they run a mix between mount and blade and skyrim with building a village. The A.I. always goes to one part of the village which is kind of annoying and the A.I get stuck in each other. The A.I can somehow walk through house's walls and they sleep in themiddle of the house in a pile. I like that you are just as strong as the A.I. because that gives it a more life-like feel to the game. Also why Doesn't the fame meter work I was grinding for hours and it as still at zero after doing tons of quests. The game feels like you always have to do something for colleting food to building a house that is pretty good for this game and if they were going for life-like they nailed it atleast with gameplay I am not going to judge the graphic becouse the gameis still in early alpha. Why doesn't the A.I, compistate you if you help build their hous.

This game has a lot of promise, and I like what I've seen so far. The cost is a small investment and they've already showed more return than most kickstarter funded games I've been into. Games can take years to develop, and I'm a sucker for medieval rpgs.\n\nNow for what you really want to read...\nIts not yet a deep game.\nYou can do a few quests. There are NPCs, but I don't remember them doing much.\nYou can build a few buildings and farm.\nGet Mauled by some bears/possibly kill them if you work really hard.\nYou can explore! There are some cool looking random structures (no interaction) and of course the randomly generated towns that slowly form (very basic).\n\n\nTLDR:\nIt's very much the shell of a game that has yet to be filled with a cream center.\nBuy it if you want to invest in a potentially awesome medievel RPG, but don't expect to jump right into playing.","April 26","true","3.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

But this one called my bluff.\nIf you wanna play a guessing game of what i like to call "which buttons will work today" then this game is for you, if not ill give you a quick rundown of how the game works in it's entirety.\nStart a world, picked my specs i wanted. little do you know if you dont get "chopper" and "worker" at least...........well...you dont get to play this round\nSpawned in, grabbed some berries, got framiliar with controls and such. Then bear attack! no big deal...I got a sword, stood behind a tree cus i knew i couldnt take him since he gets you with 5 bites, 14-19 stabs for your sword to kill him. And sure enough just like i suspected he glitches into the tree (every tree and any tree) and you just stand still and stab till you get him....okay so boring start but im sticking with it!\nGo find my first town(2 npc's and the frame of a house) and chop some trees to fininsh the towns peoples main house. Although the house is only good for sleeping. It does nothing else and neither does the quest board.\nThen Bear attack 2! mind you i've traveled about 500yrds and its been 10minutes since bear attack 1.\nI can hear him but idk where he is, so naturally i run in the house to spice things up. And behold, bear is in the middle of the house biting me with half his body under the floor boards except this time he can glide right through the house and walls no problem. So then i run, 1 bite of health to my name and my sprint bar goes out so i try for the tree trick from before but my sword is bugged and wont swing or un-equip....im doomed, but not quite! I didnt die, but why? well because the bear is faster then me, yes so i should die, but the bear cant bite while hes moving- he will stop everytime to attack. So if i dont stop, i dont die. I can even walk, I didnt even have to sprint, I just had a pet angry bear follow me for 25 minutes while i looked around for other towns. Didnt make it to the next town because i found a magic river (kinda) I was looking for a place to get rid of my bear cus I'm tired of listening to him. I could see a wide river and thought id hop in and see if i can swim or if the bear can since i cant swing my sword anyways. I leap off a little hill into the water and check my six and see the bear take a stutter step and walk off. I lost him!! But i look down and im not underwater, im not even swimming...Im literally running on top of a fairly large rivir with a decently strong current, but i aint got time for swimming....psshh im walking!\nAt this point I'm in tears laughing, with a clap and bravo zulu!\napologies for typo's and poorly writing, this game doesnt deserve my punctuation, hats off to the devs","March 26","false","3.3"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","53","8","15","15","0"

I don't like combat games and this doesn't have much at all (yet... hope it stays that way).  You have to kill bears that you get too close to but thats not difficult to do.\n\nThe first few times things went wrong I was very dissappinted, I was really enjoying myself in game and had made quite a bit of progress (as much as you can right now) so having to start over had me a bit frustrated.  But, thats what an alpha game is all about and once I got used to the concept of playing a game that isnt finished by far, I no longer mind that it doesn't work properly.

Wanting a cross over of the two, but with heaps of immersion, being able to pick any role you want and not be swarmed by a highlevel payer because you can only play multiplayer. (which is hopefully an OPTION to play in the future)\n\nHoping they keep multiplayer as a last development so we don't have to wait a month or two for them to fix up the game breaking bugs.\n\nUnfortunately, there are many bugs and glitches which are causing impatient players to down vote it. I am looking forward to the future of this game. The Roadmap they have is very reachable it only takes a little development time, meanwhile you can check out how the game looks and be there when the developments arrive.\n\nHonestly, there's probably an hour of gameplay at the moment, but if you enjoy watching AI develop their own towns or even become a leader of your own town with your own AI people then you'll enjoy that gameplay. You might even play for 100 hours just to watch the optiona 5000 AI on the map create 5000+ houses.\n\nI recommend this game if you have that spare $10, you're patient and you really enjoy immersion.

Over this short period they have released updates constantly and keep the community informed on future updates and development.

The game is centered on the idea that you start out with a sword, an axe and a torch.\nThese may change in later updates but thats how it is now. at 12/20/15\nSo far you start the game with 20 exp to spend on a max of 4 perks but could be 3 depending on what you choose.\nThese perks decide what you can do.\nChoppers cut trees down, Digger and Gardener are essential for Farming, Worker and taskmaster are needed for building and Making Settlements, and so on.\ncombat is clunky and against a bear, impossible. and you cant kill the people much to my disappointment. hopefully this will change someday.\nVillages dont really have a layout. NPCs just build a hodge podge of buildings together and call it a settlement. no walls yet, or crafting trees. which since its a crafting game seem important.\n\nThere is alot to say about the game, a better detailed review, but here is my honest opinion.\nThe game is in Alpha, not beta. Only the strip bare naked dong flapping nudity of basics are available. you can build houses (unenterable) or Farms (enterable) and grow food and "create" a settlement. which is basically NPCs hanging about a cluster of houses.\nIf you want to support the devs, do it. its $10. but do it like an investment. dont expect a Game to play, the way i did it, i spent the 10 now. in hopes that when the game in done, i wont have to spend 40 later.","December 20, 2015","true","2.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The game shows potential and i think its gonna be great once its better developed. So far i could only gather food, chop wood, talk to a few npcs and get killed by a bear. I could also kill the bear when i revived and he came after me. The bear killed me while i was reading the intro in tab. So i found a start of a settlement, the guy was asleep so i let him be. I helped him apply wood to his house and it suddenly got finnished. i enterd his home but he was stuck under his house from sleepig earlier. So i tried to build my house next to his but the hill was too steep. so i decided to try run around checking if i could build anything but the hill was too steep. So i generated a new world with worker-taskmanager and scholar perks to start a well. no matter where i went the hill was too steep so i couldnt build anything. I had some tab issues, it wouldnt always close and if i pressed ESC while in tab meny the ESC menu would pop up behind the tab screen and i was left helpless.

Settlements are scattered about and filled with adventure. While questing may be awkward now, and a lot of core functions are still in development I seriously recommend buying this game.

The villagers can and will trap you next to the town message board and will not move out of the way, bears insta-spawn beside you, and have very strange tracking, one minute they are 50-60 yards away the next they are right on top of you. The flying deer, animals that walk on water, disappearing trees, lag, and NPCs that will watch you get mauled and eaten by a bear in their village. I do understand that this game is in Alpha, but in it's current state I woefully cannot recommend it.","March 8","false","3.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","0","0","1","3","0"

Honestly that should be a primary focus or complete overhaul.\nSome menus dont have scroll bars and based on all the settings ive tried the UI scales with the settings so I cant see all of some menus like when in the garden and learning new skills.\n\nIts impossible to stack arrows that were not created with eachother. 1 log per stack is pretty lame just takes up more useless visual space in UI, would make more sense to add a total capacity rather than limiting stack sizes.\n\nhunting is pretty difficult. put 6 arrows in a buck and the thing kept running around, let alone the difficulty of putting said arrows into deers flesh had to chase it all over the place. then I got 1 piece of meat! wow that was rewarding! not really...\n\nJust started the game and the first skill is selected were Digger, Wood cutter, and the Bench Maker i think. But so far I cant find or make a shovel, or find a vendor/NPC with knowledge of shovels.\n\n","February 20","true","3.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Then there is the fact that the animals spawns in clusters, and sometimes floats in the sky. Also the most annoying part would be the fact that sometimes your hatchet or weapon dissapears but it shows like you have it in your hands but you cant after that have happened swing at anything or gather anything which is a bit annoying as the only solutions to this seems to be to restart the entire game. So while it is an early access and has a long way to go, it is a good concept, good art style, good mechanics. But you need to tweak those bugs that makes the framerate so ♥♥♥♥♥♥, as it sometimes becomes barely playable. I recommend starting with the floating animals and the fact they spawn in gigantic clusters up to maybe 20 animals per cluster, also theres a bit too many of them, realisticly thats too many animals, and they go too close to the settlements. This is mostly annoying in the form of bears when three bears suddenly walks into the settlement at random and kills you. I would recommend putting a behaviour pattern so that the bears or animals stays away from the settlements at least a few kilometers. So that it is easier to actually build and stay in the village without having to run like hell or die every single 10mins. Also reduce the ammount of animals as theres simply too many of them, you cant walk 10 paces without hitting one.","February 16","true","8.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

As it stands now, you can wander through a living world where you and a few thousand NPCs seek to find purpose. As far as I can tell the NPCs can do most things you can do, and they can be found wandering the wilderness and starting their own settlements.\n\nAs of the writing of this review, it is possible to build a settlement with basic structures such as homes, farms, tavern, etc, craft a decent number of items, gather resources and food and be killed by bears.\n\nIf what you want is a medieval game that strives to allow you to do anything and go anywhere in a world that feels alive, this game is absolutely worth the investment. Buying early access is always risky business, but this game is far enough along to get your $10 out of it, and you'll be helping the developer continue to make what could be a very compelling finished product.","February 11","true","4.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I know its early access and it is being developed on the free version of Unity, which has its limitations. Its the constant crashes or freezing that make it nearly unplayable. The bugs I can deal with if it would stay running.\n\nThey have been doing updates and trying to improve the game so I dont feel Ive wasted my money yet. At its current state Id say I do not recommend this game, however six months to a year later things may have improved to the point of playability.\n\nClipping issues and missing tectures should also be fixed but thats minor. Animations could be cleaner. Menus could be cleaned up and graphical settings added to said menu in-game, as it takes far to long to load half a dozen times tweak setting outside game and load again just to do it again. A list of controls in game menu as well.\n\nI do hope you continue to work on this and dont take my critique the wrong way as I do have hopes for this game.\n","February 6","true","1.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","2"

You can Sell the Items at the Shop but can´t rebuy them (means, if you want to buy some things, you simply lose your Money without getting the Item).\n\n3.

I know it's in early developing stages, but the idea of the game is amazing. although it misses a lot of updates and other things yet, it's still amazing when you think that it's in early developing stage. I have some ideas though, at the moment it would be a good idea to fix bugs and some other stuff before making more things, i would apreciate if the people in my town for example recognized me as their leader and called me that insted of just greeting me to the town and pointing towards me and say my name when i ask them. It would also be a good idea to actually be able to get a pickaxe when you get the skill, rather than just expect to make one yourself when you cant get any iron or stone to make one without it. That's a tatsy bit annoying, but that wont work anyway since when you get a pickaxe you still cant get any iron or stone materials yet, so as i said, a message to the developers "Focus more on the small details now, rather than making more stuff, after you have made the details you can make more things and stuff, but it wont change that your game is amazing, but i still see no reason to play it yet before those bug fixes and upgrades are made" Good luck making the game, i'm looking forward to the day you can release the full game.

In the limited amount of time I spent playing this game, the following annoyances led me to request a refund for this purchase:\n\n1. Animals and people clip through objects and float about anywhere they like.\n\n2. The bow's reticle vanishes, perhaps when you are in a settlement, perhaps not. Aiming becomes a farce at this point.\n\n3. Bears. They spawn inside settlements, where they don't bother attacking villages (or vice versa), but are more than agitated by your presence. The two good things about bears is that, when I shot it in the face with an arrow, the collision detector kept registering between the bear and the arrow as I kited the bear and it basically committed suicide, and the meat from the bear completely removed my hunger.\n\n4. My hunger bar jumped back to 50% when I went to sleep after eating that bear meat.\n\n5. You can't do anything in the game unless you have the matching basic skill choice. This means you need to pick the gathering abilities during character creation. If you don't, even chopping wood becomes a monumental task. To wit: you cannot start a character that is not a gatherer unless you like chopping wood for three days in order to make a campfire.\n\n6. When you chop wood, it quickly fills your inventory. Queue the crafting screen. This point is going to have sub-points.\n\n(A) When you are crafting, you cannot see what resources you have because it closes all access to inventory and doesn't bother telling you anywhere how many resources you have.\n\n(B) Each item takes what I assume to be in-game time to craft. During that crafting period, you are completely locked in that crafting window while time in the game continues to roll on at an accelerated pace. The blurry rectangle in the center of your screen allows you to watch at daylight changes and blurs of NPCs zoom by.\n\n(C) Let me reiterate: you are stuck in the crafting window. If you craft something that takes 2-3 hours in game, you are going to wait in that window until it is done. Do NOT try to interrupt crafting by pressing the escape key. This will simply open up the game's main menu BEHIND your crafting menu and completely bung up your ability to manipulate the crafting window once your item is finished, even if you press the escape key again to close the main menu.\n\n\nPlease look at the majority of the other reviews for this game. Even the positive ones repeat the word "potential" until the word begins to lose meaning in your head. Potential is great, sure, but I'm not going to purchase an empty, dark, dank corner and hope that a delicious mushroom grows there.\n\nAlso note the amount of time most of the reviewers have spent playing the game, including myself. Keep in mind that these reviews are written after that much gameplay. The numbers aren't very high because there is nothing to do in this game yet that is worth your attention and money.\n\nI regret having purchased this game and I hope that my review here serves as a stop sign for anyone who is casting about for a crafting/survival game. This game is not worthy. I suggest "7 Days to Die." The only reason I'm not playing that game now is that I have over 2,000 hours logged and I'm a little burned out.","February 22","false","1.0"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","36","4","11","2","0"

Nothing works and there is little help/guidance in game. It crashes a lot, and it's full of bugs such as floating animals or villagers walking on water. The quests don't seem to work properly and the skill tree is nuts, and the menus are all badly aligned and all over the place. Unfortunately, the game promises a lot in the form of a sandbox 'do what you want experience' but delivers very little at present other than a flashy trailer which doesn't reflect the actual gameplay. Other reviewers are correct about it being a basic Unity engine game with no real AI or development beyond a few placeable basics and limited interaction.\n\nCompared to Stranded Deep which was somewhat playable and enjoyable (although basic) on its alpha release, Kingdoms doesn't appear to have the fundamentals down yet to make it past an hour or so of confusing, clunky gameplay.\n\nHowever, despite the negatives, there is a boat load of potential for Kingdoms to become a great game. Unfortunately, given the unpolished and sloppily released alpha it will be difficult to restore that yearning to see and test the improvements and follow the latest news and updates that I have with other games in the genre. This is one that I'll check back on in a year.

I know that. I play a lot of early access games. Which all have issues, but this game deserves the crown. Mostly if a game doesn't run smooth, I blame my "old" pc.\nBut in this case, with all the reviews about laggy gameplay, I blame the game and devs. Sure old hardware would contribute to the problem, but this is just to extreme. I played it (When writing this review) for about 0.4 hours. That's really not that much. But for 80% I was waiting for the lags to finish, so I could take five more steps towards my goal before the next lag came.\n\nAt this moment I can not recomment this game to anyone. The concept is cool. Building your own settlement. Little bit of survival and a lot to exploration. The game has a lot of potential. But because it's so laggy, the game is just unplayable. It seems that the devs are not really fixing the "critical" issues point out by the community. But I need to be honest and say that I'm not that active in the community for this game.\n\nSo, conclusion:\n\nDo not buy it at this time if:\n- You want to play the game right away and have fun doing it\n- You have an "older" pc (upgrade first)\n- You get easy frustrated by laggy gameplay and a lot of bugs (reduce the risk of hurting you pc)\n- You can't stand flying animals (deers, bears and other)\n\nI also need to make a list of reasons for why you should buy it now:\n\nBuy it if you:\n- Like laggy gameplay\n- Want to support the devs\n- Can wait for maybe infinity to finally play this game without the agony of lags and bugs\n\nI really hope the devs will do something about those lags and bugs. I really like the concept and want to be able to play the game.\n\nI will change the review when the gameplay is better and I'm able to play the game.","March 6","false","1.1"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","14","1","7","2","1"

But at this time i think that there isnt that much to do in the game itself and therefore it doesnt seem to be that fun. Not saying that this game isnt good because it definitely is unque than what i have seen in many games in this genre and more. I say that if you are really interested in this game wait until further updates and features are added to it. If you have anyquestions about specific details that I can give you please let me know but otherwise this might be the game for you in the future.","October 29, 2015","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And I guess it has lots of potential. Though, in my opinion it came to early access way to early. Those typos are just too crazy, somewhat weird english. I mean you guys check your stuff before you update or not? Those typos are actually VERY sloppy! If this is the way you make a game, i guess you will not succeed.\n\nBut I believe in this concept and therefore you get a thumb up. At least it is already somewhat enjoyable to play.","February 6","true","17.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Expecially since alot of the players that have gotten this game have been disapointed about the stage that the game is in.\n\nThis however seems not to be the fault of the game but instead the players. Early acces means early acces. It means that there will be alot of or almost all features missing.\nI would understand the negativity if this was already a finished game but this is far from it.\n\nWhat this game does is it gives us a vision of a great game coming in the future. A game that you should really follow up and see what happens. The idea of a first person survival game that combines strategy is just priliant and expecially something that I have been waiting for a long time.\nI think this consept should have been introduced to us already in  GTA San Andreas. Once you become the head of a criminal organisation it should show.\n\nAt the moment the Ai does not really do anything. They just walk around occasionally carrying things and mostly just sit.\nI would hope that after the next patch of grafting they would implement AI that actually does the work in the village.\n\nIf you ad war and diplomacy between settlements to that and coop or vs multiplayer this game starts to be very close to a perfection.\n\nUntil that however this is just and interesting promise of a good game.","January 12","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'd recommend it to anyone interested in town building games or survival games. If you liked picking flowers or finding ore in skyrim than you'll have fun with this one. I also like all the options on the houses you can have.\nHowever it's still in the making and there are a few things needing improvement. The bears for instance, are everywhere! My character got killed 3 times just trying to find an ideal town. They even come in town so it feels a bit like they are just out to get you. I'd like to see more decorative additions too, like flower gardens and benches.\nBut in all well worth the money and time, I hope the developers continue working hard on it, because it has os much promise.","February 3","true","7.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As is it, there's not a whole lot to this game yet. I still enjoyed myself for 7 hours despite the bare-bones content currently: I ran around exploring areas and a bunch of randomly built towns, helped and watched a town grow, then finally tried my hand at building my own town. Building your own town is currently a bit buggy. I was unable to complete quests to build housing for my townspeople, so they'd always just sit around and do nothing. The game itself is also a little buggy. If towns are not built instantly upon generation of the world, including your own, gaining population is a slow, if not impossible task. Also people tend to sleep underneath the floor of their home.\n\nHowever with some time, and implementation of key features such as town battles, town politics, and improvements to city building, I think this game will entertain me for many more hours. It seems to be aiming at a singleplayer experience that simulates a survival MMO-like Rust environment, mixed with roleplay elements to give it a slight Mount&Blade feel. This game has a long ways to go, but if it gets there, it will be worth the wait.","February 3","true","7.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
