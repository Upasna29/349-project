Basically you fly around in a small flying saucer and solve small puzzles while fighting off enemies and gigantic bosses. As you travel through the shadow planet you will get new abilities that allow you to backtrack to previous areas to open new areas like any Metroidvania type game, though most of the collectibles you find by backtracking are concept art pieces and short movie clips.\n\nThe art style and music create a very nice atmosphere, and the controls are fairly smooth. Most of the special abilities you get are very creative and fun to use, my favorite being the buzzsaw. There's not a lot of tutorials or hints, but there's an objective marker and you get an info tool you can point at things to find out how to interact with them.\n\nAll-in-all it was a very good game in my opinion and it's only about 8 hours to play through the entire game and find all of the collectibles. I recommend picking it up sometime.","October 24, 2014","true","16.6"," 34 of 39 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","34","39","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ichikumer/recommended/205730/","ichikumer","ichik","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ichikumer/","1268 products in account","Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet is notorious for two reasons. First and most obvious is absolutely glorious visual style by Michel Gagné; it’s dark, macabre, slightly frightening, but at the same time truly beautiful and not repulsing even by a tiny fraction despite all of the picturing of those tentacles and insect-like creatures. Second prominent feature is the protagonist. You see, despite all the variety of settings and worlds and stories a hero in metroidvania usually is a human, or at least some humanoid. But here you play as small flying saucer; so technically there’s still some humanoid inside. Obviously it impacts gameplay turning it into twin-stick shooter and omitting platforming with all it’s precision jumping and running. What it has instead is all different kinds of guns and devices that our UFO can use. Among them there are not only assorted lasers and blasters, but also a buzz-saw, a grappling claw, protective shield and so much more. So you fly around, shoot stuff and sometimes solve some puzzles. They’re neither challenging nor time consuming, but their presence is enough to transform what could be a blazing gun carnage into an exploration of beautiful yet twisted and insane world.\nSpeaking of which, there may be not a lot of variety on the first sight, but there surely is distinct difference on what kind of thrill you can expect from different game zones. There’s soothing calm of ice zone disturbed only by pesky and ubiquitous enemies; there’s tension of mandatory underwater level; and then there’s those enigmatic factory and all those different yet very familiar regions of the Shadow Planet. It’s not just bland similarity, but rather a true sense of interconnectivity that is the result of this distinct visual style of minimalistic mix of black shadows and pure-color backgrounds. This world doesn’t look or feel artificial, it’s as natural as a background for digital entertainment can get. It’s complete and interconnected; it feels solid, ready to be explored by a curious traveler, who’s on a mission to restore it, rather than just tear it apart.\nAnd because of its small size and simple story the game forms an intimate bond with the player.  It’s not a feeling of attachment but rather a sense of lasting mutual sympathy. If anything,  Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet in a short few hours that you need to finish it accomplishes the task of teaching you a handful of interesting tricks while giving just enough time and space to toy with them to your amusement. Facing new challenge most of the time you either will know the solution right out or will figure it out faster than frustration kicks in. And that is not something easy to do, when an average gamer has an attention span shorter than one of a goldfish. Not that the game is a cakewalk from start to finish; there are bosses, you see. And they have all their bossy stuff: attack patterns, heavy attacks and weak points, that you’ll have to figure out to exploit them. So you’ll maybe even fail a few times while dealing with them.\nInsanely Twisted Shadow Planet makes you feel invested without caring to present itself believable or even needing that for that matter. It’s a fiction that works on sheer kinetics and aesthetics; it doesn’t tell a story, it makes you perform it. The game simply unfolds with elegance and simplicity of a pop-up book and gives you the keys to the entrance.","January 31, 2015","true","6.0"," 24 of 25 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","24","25","0","0"

The gameplay is solid, metroidvania-style spaceship shoot'em up. The puzzles and fighting can get rather difficult at times, but never unfair. If you fail a few times you will recognise patterns and you'll eventually get it.\n\nYou end up getting about 10 different weapons to play with, but the ones you get near th end of the game end up being just utility/physics in a very few niche situations. It just seems to work that way with these type of shooters, and it doesn't really change gameplay dramatically enough for any refreshing changes. One thing I like to see in metroidvania games are mobility abilities and this game lacks them.\n\nThe game tries convey a story through very short cutscenes and gameplay and while it works at getting the story through, it didn't work well at making a compelling narrative. I would have preferred some dialog but I can see why they choose this style. It just didn't jive with me. Same goes for the art style. It works well for the game and is unique without being 16-bit pixel indie game graphics, but I would have preferred more colors than black in every scene, even though you are on a "shadow planet".

Now we got that, too!\n\nITSP is a Metroidvania-type game where you control a flying saucer through an... well, an insanely twisted shadow planet! You gain new abilities and have to backtrack to other locations where your new ability will come in handy. The visual aesthetics are comical yet not ridiculous, the sound design is quite intense. The game's cutscenes feature music by Dimmu Borgir, whereas the background music is more atmospheric yet not less fitting.\n\nAll in all a very engaging experience, some may consider it short, yet intense none the less. Recommended!\n\n\n[CONCERNING FRAMERATE ISSUES]\n\nEdit: I feel like I have to edit this review. The game is great in design and visual style! Yet, unfortunately, for some users there seems to be a problem, that the game just won't go above 30fps. Which is pretty cross, as the game is intended to run in 60fps and gets slower with the framerate. Thus, people who have the same problem as me will play through the game in HALF OF THE INTENDED GAMESPEED. For nVidia users, turning on maximum performance in power management mode works, for amd users, like me, however... nope? I'll remove this text, as soon as a fix has been found.\n\nEdit 2: After having this issue for two years and almost forgetting about it, out of curiosity I checked how well ITSP would perform on the very same machine after I did the upgrade to Windows 10. I didn't change any of the hardware. I just looked into the game and WOW it's RUNNING LIKE HELL! Verified with Fraps - yupp. Solid 60fps now. :) I will let the first edit stay here for reference for others.\nVerdict: Runs great - even better - on Windows 10.

Each area has a distinct feel, and all of the items obtained throughout the game are powerful and have a few different uses. Sound design is very well done, and adds to the feel of the game world immensely. The world is easy to navigate, although I feel there could have been a few more shortcuts to connect the various areas together. Backtracking is mostly optional, and is not tedious since there are doors to open with newfound abilities. Boss design is solid, and the last two bosses especially were a lot of fun. Enemy design is a bit less inspired, but is diverse enough to avoid getting stale.","September 27, 2015","true","5.6"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","14","16","0","0"

At first it looks like it's going to be a mediocre shmup since you start with a pea shooter. However, it's actually more of a puzzle game than an action game. The early enemies are worth just breezing past. The game gets better as you add more and more tools. Some of the areas are quite clever in how they use their mechanics: shooting, bouncing laser beams, changing the screen orientation, picking up things, using a gravity beam, and cutting through rocks.\n\nThere are a few misses here though. The main one for me is the useless Metroidvania setup. The game will nicely mark the map in places where you need a specific tool to pass, but there's no way to fast travel there. So, if you actually follow up on the locked gates, you'll spend a lot of time backtracking only to get some pretty useless rewards: art/story unlocks and wimpy unneeded ship upgrades. Unless you're a completionist, don't worry too much about backtracking.\n\nThe story here is as simple as can be: Alien type B has invaded your Alien type A world. You need to destroy Alien type B to save Alien type A. There's no need for a more complex story in this kind of game, so I think that part of it was fine.\n\nThe graphics are nothing spectacular, but it does have a nice enough art style. It's generally pretty clear what everything is doing and the background and foreground don't mix together.\n\nI've been playing a lot of indie titles for the last month, and seeing another shmup/puzzler didn't give me much faith, but I did enjoy the game in the four hours it took me to finish it.","February 24, 2015","true","3.7"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

I watched the trailers  and knew there would be puzzles and it wasn't a hardcore game, but all the time the whole "insanely twisted shadow planet" feeling seemed to be solid and interesting. Well, it wasn't quite like what I wanted. Here's a list of pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n- Great visuals overall.\n- Really good and original enemy design. (even though some of them are re-used with little differences they still are great to look at)\n- Nice soundtracks that fit in with the shadowy atmosphere.\n- Fluid control.\n\nCons:\n- The plot is extremely simple, being almost meaningless.\n- The puzzles aren't challenging, some will require a little bit of thought, but overall they are pretty simple.\n- Bosses are quite easy.\n- Too short for its price. (finished it in a little more than 5 hours and it could be much faster)\n\nThere are many indies games that are very simple and yet you find yourself wondering about what's happening or wanting to help the characters to reach their objective. As already mentioned, you don't get attached to the character's objective or anything, you simply have one mission and complete it. The game is very forgiving and will give you several checkpoints along the way so you don't lose almost any progress when you die, I didn't put that on the lists because it can be pleasant or not to you. The most challenging things are to get optional upgrades, so you should have in mind it's pretty casual.\n\nIn the end I recommend only getting this game if it is on sale and you want something casual to pass time.","June 5, 2014","false","5.3"," 32 of 55 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","32","55","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/crumbdumpster/recommended/205730/","crumbdumpster","Crumb Dumpster","http://steamcommunity.com/id/crumbdumpster/","155 products in account","ITSP is a very concise game. It might not be long, but it's always moving; you're always getting new equipment and doing new things. You're always solving puzzles that are mechanically different from the last. It is nearly devoid of filler unless you actually want to get all of the concept art unlocks, and this is a path that I prefer developers take. I want short games that don't endlessly repeat over long ones that feel like a chore.\n\nThe puzzles aren't the most difficult out there, but they're imaginative and are very appealing in visuals/effects. The entire game, in fact, is one of the most visually appealing games I've ever played. The world itself is alive and squirming around you. The animation and kinematics are extremely smooth. The camera fluidly zooms in and out to frame the environment around you; for boss battles this means you are a very tiny ship in front of a monster taking up half of your screen. Areas have distinct color palettes with parallax backgrounds (also with animated squirmy things moving around in the distance), but the palettes are always limited in nature and most feature the distinct black silhouetted foreground that probably caught your eye to begin with.\n\nI have a few dislikes about the game. The first is that it feels like it straddles the border between explicitly telling a story and leaving the story to the gameplay. It has these confusing cutscenes that don't really assemble into much of anything I care about. Honestly, I am fine if you just show me the planet/sun being corrupted by a dark force, allow me to infer that I need to stop it, and leave me be for the rest of the game; let the gameplay tell the story. This plot is not on the scale of Mass Effect or The Witcher where you'd need anything else explained in any other way.\n\nSecondly, despite the quasi-storytelling, it doesn't properly build up to an ending; there is nearly nothing to suggest that you're nearing your ultimate goal of cleansing the planet and no real signifier that the last boss is... well, the last boss. Yes, it's really big, but so are the other bosses, it doesn't strike you as particularly end-guy'ish, so you beat it, pat yourself on the back, and then realize the game is over. For how fascinating the game was and how often it "ups itself" with something even more neat, I was hoping for an ending a bit more dramatic/climactic, something like an end-guy with a mind-exploding size that you have to beat in pieces at a time, or the throbbing core of the planet itself.\n\nDespite a somewhat deflating end, ITSP is fascinating and entertaining. It's a game that makes you laugh because of how awesome its bits are, be those items you collected, the visuals of an environment you just entered, the very clever effects and how they integrate with the puzzles you are solving, or just how big everything around you is. It packs a lot into the several hours it takes to beat and makes them very worthwhile. If the main flaws above were fixed I feel like it could be one of my top favorite games - the potential is there but it got a bit muddled up - but the game as it turned out must settle for "just" being really good.","December 2, 2014","true","6.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

However, if that hasn't scared you off, read on. ITSP is a fairly unique puzzle/shooter hybrid in the classic "Metroidvania" style (explore a sprawling 2D map using progressively earned abilities, backtracking to progress further, etc). So what sets this apart from similar games? Firstly, it has a very unique 'shadowy' art style that is pretty cool. And second, instead of being a character-based platformer, it's a spaceship-based twin-stick shooter with heavy puzzle elements. If that sounds interesting or up your alley, I would say don't hesitate to check this out. The only downsides to the experience are that the game is pretty short (~7 hours for the single-player, but it also has a multiplayer mode) and it is not particularly difficult (you will certainly die on occasion, but checkpoints are plentiful). It's not an all-time classic, but it's definitely a cool low-key experience. Check it out!","June 11, 2012","true","7.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The game offers a neat space exploration idea with you avdenturing through the Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet and picking up weapons, upgrades and fighting massive bosses along the way.  It has alot of creativity for the way each part of the planet feels different and artsy style of the game has some real charm to keep you attracted to not only your doing in the main game, but really feeling your tiny scale ship in such a massively scaled planet.

The art and atmosphere are great, and the steam adaptation's really smooth in contrast to console version. I played this on both xbox 360 and Steam, so I can safely say that it works just as great on steam as it does on any console. It's a really fun game, the price might be steep but I got it while it was on sale for 4-5 dollars. If it's on sale, this is definitely an awesome game to own. It's a little steep at 14.99 I must admit, because the content is great and all but...There isn't exactly 14.99 worth of content. It's dissapointing how dead multiplayer is these days. No people around to play shadow run/lantern run with. Shadow Run is free, and i'm pretty sure when it released on console it was DLC with a 2-5 dollar price tag, so it's more content for less bull.

An Enjoyable Metroidvania That Made Me Feel Clever.Genre: 2D Metroidvania Exploration/Puzzle Game.\nDeveloped & Published by: Shadow Planet Productions & Microsoft Studios\nPlatform: Windows, Mac and Linux\nBusiness Model: Base Game only.\nCopy Purchased by Myself Preamble\nFly around in your own “little” flying saucer picking up weapons or tools, figuring out puzzles and enjoying artistic backgrounds. The lack of gravity means you get a wide degree of movement though the levels themselves with limit where you can go. Gliding around in this flying saucer was definitely a different experience from the norm.\n\nOverall Gameplay Thoughts\nThat being said, exploration and puzzle solving is the main focus of this game. Combat is straightforward with your weapons being easy to aim and land on enemies. That being said, you'll need to keep in mind that neither of you can handle more than a few shots, exempting bosses. So, it’s in your best interest to dodge the shots coming your way. The saucer can only heal from save checkpoints and rare health pickups, so avoid taking damage whenever possible. While enemies do re-spawn when they’re off-screen, they can be bypassed if you're simply passing through the area. Most of your time will be spent focusing on exploring this crazy planet you've landed on. Thanks to the pacing of the game and upgrades you can find, said exploration remains enjoyable the entire time.\n\nWhat I really liked about this title is that I felt clever when I made progress. Boss fights aren't big slug fests where you outlast your enemies but outthink them. You just need to use the tools and weapons you find along the way. If you’re having a frustrating time with a certain situation you find yourself in, you probably need to think your way out of it differently. Use the scanning tool. It will help you out a lot if you get stuck. The only part of this game that can get overly frustrating is the ice level, where you have to place ice crystals in the right places to get a beam of light to where you need it. The pick-up tool is...quirky and sometimes won't place the crystals correctly.\n\nStory\nYou follow the adventure of an alien who has gone to...well...an insanely twisted up shadowy planet to stop an invading force from destroying their planet. At least, that’s what I got out of the story. Most of the story is shown via pictures and cutscenes with no text or voice over to really clue you in to what’s going on. As the cutscenes are short, they only give you a basic idea of what’s going on. So, there’s not much to say about the story.\n\nPC Settings and Port Report\nITSP makes it way from Xbox to the PC platform in good form. Custom resolutions, fullscreen, texture and shader quality sliders (on/off choices) as well as depth of field and anti-aliasing up to 8x are here. It’s more than I’d expect from a 2D game but I’m definitely not complaining. The game runs exceptionally well and I never ran into bugs or crashes during my time with it. Keyboard bindings are present but you’ll have a better time with a controller as the movement simply feels more natural with an analogue stick. I didn't try out any of the multiplayer, I just wasn't all that interested in it.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nIt felt like this title mostly got ignored, which is a shame because there’s a really solid game here. Sure, the laser puzzles are finicky and the combat depth is shallow. But the presentation is solid, the pacing is great and the atmosphere is really nice. Add in some fun exploration and clever boss fights to make for a great title.\n\nReleased nearly three years ago, I only recently picked up and played Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet. I left the experience rather satisfied. Which is rare, as this genre is so often plagued with some sort of pacing or mechanical issues that get in the way of having a fun time. I recommend picking Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet up if you're in the market for this type of game.\n\nRead this review and more on A Paladin Without A Crusade.[kingisaaclinksr.com]","February 28, 2015","true","4.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The world is almost entirely open and gates that can only be unlocked with new weapons pop up from the beginning. The map clearly shows what has been explored and what hasn't and can even note the weapon needed for a particular gate. It's all here, save the fun. There's just too much frustration to allow fun to flourish. Enemies respawn at surprising rates which would be fine if it was any fun to shoot them. Past the first time realizing that a new weapon would be better used on this enemy or that, fighting is a chore. The often narrow, obstacle-fulled corridors would be more at home in a puzzle-platformer which Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet very nearly is, and would be better for being. The two co-op modes - a feature that should be an absolute boon for such a short game - doesn't help with that either. They both emphasize the worst elements of the game by adding more combat and forcing the player to cart something around for the entire mode, a mechanic that only serves to point out how finicky the grabber arm is. Both modes also feature a timed element and remove all the enjoyable exploration and permanent advancement that made the main campaign so close to being something great in the first place. And there is something great hiding in Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet. Sadly, it's just too buried under layers and layers of poor execution to really shine.","March 21","false","9.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","3"

As the screenshots show, this game has a sort of cartoony dark sci-fi horror theme going, which is easily its best point. But the world design and the myriad of puzzles and enemies are great as well. Especially boss fights are well rounded out: not too easy nor too hard, making use of a mechanic you've learned previously and usually rewarding you with a new toy to play with.\n\nThe controls took some getting used to (especially guiding rockets), and I found swapping the controller for a keyboard and mouse to make things MUCH easier (this is probably me, though).\n\nAs for the story: take it for good or for bad, but there is no dialogue. At all. No cutscene text, no voice-overs, no tutorials (in the literal sense...level design is set to make you acquainted with new weapons), no nothing.  So you can only take a guess at things like why you're there or even what the weapons are called, but it doesn't distract much. This is a game that should be played...not watched or read.\n\n'metroidvania' is the typical term for this sort of game (only one huge-♥♥♥ level but most parts are locked until you have a certain item), but I'm not sure I want to classify it as such. The reason is that it felt pretty linear. I rarely backtracked or explored anything outside where I was pointed out to go, and the only time I felt lost was in the part where the map rotated (you'll know when you get there). Oh, and you're flying a spaceship. That's a rather unusual (if not unique) approach for this kind of game.\n\nBut all in all, it's certainly a game worth playing. Not very long, but it shouldn't be any longer: as it is, it's packed with all the good stuff. :-)\n\nIn score, I'd say 7,5 or 8 on 10. But since it's personal, it doesn't say much on what YOU may think it's worth...","November 16, 2014","true","4.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

In short, you explore a large map finding and applying new-found tools to combat and puzzles. The game looks fantastic, and obviously had a lot of thought put into it, which is why it is so disappointing that it just barely fell short of being a good game.\n\nThe controls are imprecise and the the combat is unforgiving. You'll more than once find yourself googling the solution to "puzzles" not because they are hard, but rather because the mechanics are so poorly explained you won't know what to do. The map looks non-linear, but it isn't. You always need the next tool to get the next tool, etc... Only the secret areas are non-linear in any sense of the word, and they just involve back-tracking through completed areas for longer than it takes for that prospect to become incredibly boring. I've seen free "Metroidvania" flash games less frustrating than this. Make no mistake, you're paying for the artist's work that went into making this game look amazing, not for good game mechanics, and not for innovation.\n\nThere's two online/local multiplayer modes as well, but they focus entirely on one of the most frustrating mechanics in the game: dragging an objective along while you are rendered defenseless, relying on either your teammates or your multitasking to protect yourself. Seems like an opportunity was missed for some very fun cooperative puzzles, but such is the life of an X-Box port.\n\nSave your money, and don't think for a moment this game lives up to the hype. It's more frustrating than fun, and that's the real tragedy here.","February 17, 2015","false","8.3"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

It was really frustrating at first, but now it runs just fine.\n\nArt and sound design are really great--sort of a Gashlycrumb Tinies meets Limbo in space.\n\nThe problem with the game is actually playing it. It feels quite slow--the mechanics are too sluggish and frustrating for a long Metroid-style game. The little saucer guy drives like a low-performance car--every stick move and aim direction telegraphs with a slow lag from the controller to the animation, as if through a dense molasses. It seems that this is intentionally part of the game design, but it's still frustrating and impedes the fun. If I'm traversing a big level repeatedly, I'd like the things I'm doing (dodging, taking out baddies) to be fun each time through. This doesn't quite achieve that. I finished it just to see the ending.\n\nA not-recommended that might be a mixed-recommended, depending on how you like the slow pacing and sludgy movement.

Instead of actually posting that to the game's activity page here on Steam (every game has one on this "service" you know) to give the GFWL players a heads up of the impending change, the only notice of the game's dropping of GFWL was a link to some indietalk post in the discussion pages for the game. Nothing official from the developer at all on the game's Steam activity page. Warner Brothers was bad enough switching over with no notice, but at least they had an official announcement on Steam; this game did not. The developer also had quite the arrogant Twitter post about this; and as a GFWL gamer, I got my save destroyed, lost my GFWL data, and feel stupid and insulted because I actually paid for this a while back to support them as a GFWL gamer when everyone else was b1tching and moaning about GFWL because GOD FORBID Microsoft published the game in the first place (and where was Valve then eh?). Even though I backed this game up before the update, Steam will not let you play off a backup without forcing the update. So much for the "usefulness" of automatic updates. I got through the first level and this one was going to part of my GFWL gaming activity over the holiday from college, but now I can not and for that I will not support a developer as uncaring as this. Neither should you. Steam has over 3000+ games in its "service" - do yourself a favor and play a game in which the developer uses the tools that the service he is supposedly gaga for offers instead of being kind of a jerk about the changeover on freaking Twitter.","December 28, 2013","false","0.6"," 3 of 14 people (21%) found this review helpful","21","3","14","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zombkraken/recommended/205730/","zombkraken","THE KRAKEN","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zombkraken/","453 products in account","We exploded aliens, solved puzzles, and, in generally, kicked ♥♥♥. What more is there to say? Let’s get into the review.\n\nI – Story [6/10]\n\nInsanely Twisted Shadow Planet is a  2-D action/adventure from Shadow Planet Productions. The story is simple: you (an alien) are tasked with exploring an incredibly hostile planet; making your way steadily to the center in the hopes that you can save your home world by destroying an alien infestation at it’s source. Like I said, simple. But, it was well done all the same.\n\nII – UI [8/10]\n\nThe user interface in ITSP is intuitive and easy to master. HUD is almost non-existent, forcing you to really on visuals to assess your level of health. There is no reticle for aiming (which I wasn’t the biggest fan of, but whatever). The map was very user friendly, but can become cumbersome as there is no mini-map on screen. When you receive a new objective, a directional bubble points you in the right direction and off you go.\n\nIII – Gameplay [10/10]\n\nThere are three modes of play in ITSP. Firstly, there was the campaign. As I explained above, the story line is simple and there are no real side quests to speak of. You make your journey deeper and deeper into the hostile planet until you have accomplished your ultimate goal.\n\nOne of my favorite aspects of the game was the research tool that your space craft is equipped with. You will use this tool the entire game to figure out how things work and to assist you in solving various puzzles. You point it at what needs scanning, scan it, and then pick the right tool for the job. I personally thought that this was a novel way of learning as you go and getting through the game.\n\nCombat is simple; just point and shoot (or saw, in a lot of cases). Each enemy has a certain weapon that is best against it, though you don’t strictly have to use that one weapon if you don’t want to. Why blow something up with a rocket when you can melt it with a laser beam or cut it in half with a gigantic saw blade? My thoughts exactly.\n\nThe second game mode is called “Lantern Run”. While all the game modes are co-op, this one was definitely designed to be played co-op rather than alone. In this mode of play the player(s) have to drag a lantern (or multiple lanterns) as far into a cavern as they can go. All the while they are being chased by a huge alien monster. Every so far into the cavern, the player(s) must stop in an arena and fight respawning enemies until the big one catches up and breaks through the next wall for you. If all of the lanterns break, it’s game over.\n\nThe third game mode is called “Shadow Hunters”. Again, this is another one that was designed for co-op. The player(s) must drag a bomb through a cavern that is teeming with enemies. The bomb has a timer that is always counting down, though it can be recharged at bomb recharge stations. If the bomb takes damage, the timer goes down faster. Every so far down the cavern, the player(s) will again be stopping in caverns to fight both regular enemies and boss enemies (hence the bomb you’re carrying).\n\nWhile all the modes of play were pretty fun, I particularly enjoyed the campaign best. Though, I didn’t have the chance to get much co-op time in.\n\nIV – Content [6/10]\n\nFor as big of an in-game map as ITSP has, I was a bit disappointed by the amount of content. There are several tools that you’ll zoom around the planet collecting, but only one is upgradeable. In addition to this, while your hull armor is also upgradeable, there is no way to change what your craft looks like (even though other space crafts are selectable in the Shadow Hunters game mode).\n\nThere were a lot of different enemy types though, although a seemed to be the same enemy with a new theme for each biome of the planet. The boss battles were all pretty fun, blending combat and puzzle solving into a chaotic good time.\n\nV – Visuals [10/10]\n\nThe visuals of Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet were splendid. It had a creepy, Tim Burton-esque feel and was almost endearing in a way. While the enemies were fascinating enough, it was the environments of the planet that were truly breathtaking and made exploring the hostile underground a real treat.\n\nVI – Audio [10/10]\n\nThe music of ITSP was fantastic and always seem to kick in right when it would boost the immersion the most. The ambiance throughout the game was great and all the sound effects fit in to the game world perfectly.\n\nVII – Overall [8.3/10]\n\nOverall, Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet is a genuinely fun game and is easily worth the full price tag. If you can get it on sale, great, if not, you won’t be disappointed anyway.","January 25, 2015","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game looks great and has a ambient, foreboding soundtrack that sets the mood well.  Simply getting around the environment is fun and the level design is quite good; there's enough variation in the tunnels you're going through that it's easy to develop a map in your head, but never so difficult you get lost or hung up frequently.  The several zones all have a very distinct look and feel and offer unique challenges.\n\nThe game is fun; it's a little short – I beat the game 100% in a little under 6 hours – but for the right price is a good deal for the money.  I do wish the bosses were a little bit harder...the only reason I died on them was simply because I didn't know what to do; as soon as I did they almost became pushovers.\n\nFor the size and scope it's aiming for, ITSP executes very well. Other than one zone that has you fumbling around in the dark (for all of about 5 minutes), I never got frustrated and enjoyed pushing forward, exploring and seeing what's around the next corner.\n\nWord of advice, though: if you're aiming to get all the collectables, scour as you go.  There's no way of seeing their location on the map, so it can be quite difficult to find things later on when the whole map is uncovered and you don't remember where you did or didn't pick them up.  I don't think it would work well to put the locations of them on the map, but it would have been nice if the developer added icons for the ones you had picked up so you would know where not to look.\n\nAnyways, all around a good, quick and fun game.","November 14, 2014","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It includes vast maps with a lot of space to explore filled enemy minions as well as some boss monsters/mechas and really nice puzzles.\n\nBy far the best thing about this game has, to me, is each chapter's highly distinctive atmosphere and playstyle. The mechanical level includes a industrial, steampunk, clockwork theme as electrical level creates a feeling of traveling inside a huge dark derelict alien computer machine.\n\nIf you like indie games with creative, dark, captivating theme you will never forget this game once you play it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kaocrat/recommended/205730/","kaocrat","kaocrat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kaocrat/","259 products in account","Really love this game. It's Super Metroid in a flying saucer with physics puzzles and beatiful 2D visuals somewhere in between Limbo, World of Goo, and Tim Burton. Every collectible is fun to acquire, every weapon/item is useful and fun to use, and the gating of areas is almost always tied to inventive use of your items and is never a glorified lock and key ala Metroid's weapon-specific doors. In order to progress from area to area you will do things like ride currents through twisty underwater tunnels, reflect laser beams off of ice crystals, and drill passageways through rock walls. The boss fights are exciting and well designed, requiring you to make interesting uses of the tools you have acquired (similar to Zelda boss fights except more intricate). Music is wonderful, usually just ambient themes to set the mood of each region, with occasional uptempo moments reminscent of the most exciting parts of older Danny Elfman movie scores.\n\nControl is very good with the mouse and keyboard, though if you have a twin analogue stick controller, I suspect the game will play even better this way. You move your ship in 8 directions with the keyboard, and aim your weapons/items in 360 degrees with the mouse. You switch between items with a radial menu brought up by bolding the right mouse button.\n\nCombat is a relatively small part of the game, but well done. Enemies are varied and require different tactics to take down. Most enemies are perticularly vulnerable to a specific weapon, but all of them can be tackled in more than one way. There is considerable overlap between enemies/items/environmental elements, and oftentimes you will solve puzzles by manipulating enemies. There are many things which can kill you, but very few cheap deaths. There are ample checkpoints throughout the game so you are never set too far back when you die.\n\nExploration is a healthy balance of backtracking and unlocking new areas. There are optional side paths to explore which lead to upgrades and other collectibles. Each area has a distinct look, which makes it easier to keep track of where you are going. There is an auto-map feature which fills in as you explore new areas, and a red blinking objective is marked on the map at all times, indicating where you should go next in order to progress.\n\nYour ship is equipped with a scanner ala metroid prime, which can be used to get information on enemies' weaknesses, as well as indicating which item is needed to break through obstacles or activate certain objects. The great thing about this is that once you scan an obstacle, your map will be updated with an icon indicating which item is needed to proceed. This way you can easily find your way back to the same spot when you have the item you need. By the time you acquire each new item, you will already have marked several places on the map where it is needed, which means you'll immediately have a list of places to return to and try out your new items.\n\nI completed Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet in about 7 hours, with most of the collectibles and upgrades, so it's not the longest game. However I think it's worth noting that there are no "filler" sections in this game, nor is there a lot of busywork or gratuitious backtracking like you find in most open-world exploration games. A major reason that the game goes by so quickly is because of the aforementioned excellent map system and easily identifiable zones. The persistent "objective" marker combined with the fact that the map notes all of the obstacles you encounter with icons indicating which tool you need to pass them, is another reason why you can complete this game so quickly. In short, the game is very well designed and respects your time, which means you will get through the content much faster than in a less thoughtfully designed adventure.\n\nMAC USERS: I had a lot of performance issues with this game. There were frequent periods of intense slowdown, and the game crashed or froze many times. Tweaking the graphical settings did not seem to have any effect on the framerate. The only thing that made any difference was to quit the game when the framerate started to drop, and then start it back up again. Most of the time the game ran better when it was first started up, and would start to perform worse and worse as time went on.\n\n","November 9, 2014","true","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While the game does combat quite nicely for the most part, it struggles in the other two areas. Puzzles are usually interesting yet don't provide much of a challenge. And despite the map being so massive, there's a lot of backtracking and perhaps too much linearity over the course of the campaign.\n\nIn spite of these issues, ITSP is still a fun experience. Its best accomplishment is creating a wonderful world that oozes atmosphere through its eerie ambient sounds and a colorful animation style that's used to create some beautiful, creepy and varied environments. There's a good variety of ship upgrades, although switching between them on a gamepad can be clunky. The main campaign is pretty short but I felt that was much more preferable to dragging on for too long. And while the puzzle-solving isn't a strong point, the combat portions of the game are fun thanks to the simplified controls and bizarre enemies/bosses.\n\nWhile far from perfect, ITSP is a solid enough game to warrant a discounted purchase. A flawed yet atmospheric and beautiful space shooter that features huge and diverse locations and some solid twin-stick combat.","March 14, 2013","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's quite strictly linear- don't expect to sequence break or do levels out of order. Nevertheless you can and should backtrack to collect upgrades that were blocked off before.\n\nThey really got the atmosphere right, too.  It feels like you are a tiny tresspasser on a violently hostile, starkly alien planet, completely alone and carefully blazing a trail into the heart of the beast to strike where it is most vulnerable.\n\nI only have one real complaint- it seemed a little short. I wouldn't have minded a couple more areas.","July 22, 2012","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's got a great balance of puzzle and exploration elements, and if you like Metroidvania style exploration, you should definitely pick it up. It doesn't have the same enemy density as a Metroidvania game, and sometimes it's a better tactical decision to run than fight. The boss fights are clever, making good use of the weapons available to you at the time, neither too easy nor frustratingly difficult, offering a balanced challenge.

As you travel through the shadow planet you will get new abilities that allow you to backtrack to previous areas to open new areas like any Metroidvania type game, though most of the collectibles you find by backtracking are concept art pieces and short movie clips.\n\nThe art style and music create a very nice atmosphere, and the controls are fairly smooth. Most of the special abilities you get are very creative and fun to use, my favorite being the buzzsaw. There's not a lot of tutorials or hints, but there's an objective marker and you get an info tool you can point at things to find out how to interact with them.\n\nAll-in-all it was a very good game in my opinion and it's only about 8 hours to play through the entire game and find all of the collectibles.

What more is there to say? Let’s get into the review.\n\nI – Story [6/10]\n\nInsanely Twisted Shadow Planet is a  2-D action/adventure from Shadow Planet Productions. The story is simple: you (an alien) are tasked with exploring an incredibly hostile planet; making your way steadily to the center in the hopes that you can save your home world by destroying an alien infestation at it’s source. Like I said, simple. But, it was well done all the same.\n\nII – UI [8/10]\n\nThe user interface in ITSP is intuitive and easy to master. HUD is almost non-existent, forcing you to really on visuals to assess your level of health. There is no reticle for aiming (which I wasn’t the biggest fan of, but whatever). The map was very user friendly, but can become cumbersome as there is no mini-map on screen. When you receive a new objective, a directional bubble points you in the right direction and off you go.\n\nIII – Gameplay [10/10]\n\nThere are three modes of play in ITSP. Firstly, there was the campaign. As I explained above, the story line is simple and there are no real side quests to speak of. You make your journey deeper and deeper into the hostile planet until you have accomplished your ultimate goal.\n\nOne of my favorite aspects of the game was the research tool that your space craft is equipped with. You will use this tool the entire game to figure out how things work and to assist you in solving various puzzles. You point it at what needs scanning, scan it, and then pick the right tool for the job. I personally thought that this was a novel way of learning as you go and getting through the game.\n\nCombat is simple; just point and shoot (or saw, in a lot of cases). Each enemy has a certain weapon that is best against it, though you don’t strictly have to use that one weapon if you don’t want to. Why blow something up with a rocket when you can melt it with a laser beam or cut it in half with a gigantic saw blade? My thoughts exactly.\n\nThe second game mode is called “Lantern Run”. While all the game modes are co-op, this one was definitely designed to be played co-op rather than alone. In this mode of play the player(s) have to drag a lantern (or multiple lanterns) as far into a cavern as they can go. All the while they are being chased by a huge alien monster. Every so far into the cavern, the player(s) must stop in an arena and fight respawning enemies until the big one catches up and breaks through the next wall for you. If all of the lanterns break, it’s game over.\n\nThe third game mode is called “Shadow Hunters”. Again, this is another one that was designed for co-op. The player(s) must drag a bomb through a cavern that is teeming with enemies. The bomb has a timer that is always counting down, though it can be recharged at bomb recharge stations. If the bomb takes damage, the timer goes down faster. Every so far down the cavern, the player(s) will again be stopping in caverns to fight both regular enemies and boss enemies (hence the bomb you’re carrying).\n\nWhile all the modes of play were pretty fun, I particularly enjoyed the campaign best. Though, I didn’t have the chance to get much co-op time in.\n\nIV – Content [6/10]\n\nFor as big of an in-game map as ITSP has, I was a bit disappointed by the amount of content. There are several tools that you’ll zoom around the planet collecting, but only one is upgradeable. In addition to this, while your hull armor is also upgradeable, there is no way to change what your craft looks like (even though other space crafts are selectable in the Shadow Hunters game mode).\n\nThere were a lot of different enemy types though, although a seemed to be the same enemy with a new theme for each biome of the planet. The boss battles were all pretty fun, blending combat and puzzle solving into a chaotic good time.\n\nV – Visuals [10/10]\n\nThe visuals of Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet were splendid. It had a creepy, Tim Burton-esque feel and was almost endearing in a way. While the enemies were fascinating enough, it was the environments of the planet that were truly breathtaking and made exploring the hostile underground a real treat.\n\nVI – Audio [10/10]\n\nThe music of ITSP was fantastic and always seem to kick in right when it would boost the immersion the most. The ambiance throughout the game was great and all the sound effects fit in to the game world perfectly.\n\nVII – Overall [8.3/10]\n\nOverall, Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet is a genuinely fun game and is easily worth the full price tag. If you can get it on sale, great, if not, you won’t be disappointed anyway.","January 25, 2015","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game looks great and has a ambient, foreboding soundtrack that sets the mood well.  Simply getting around the environment is fun and the level design is quite good; there's enough variation in the tunnels you're going through that it's easy to develop a map in your head, but never so difficult you get lost or hung up frequently.  The several zones all have a very distinct look and feel and offer unique challenges.\n\nThe game is fun; it's a little short – I beat the game 100% in a little under 6 hours – but for the right price is a good deal for the money.  I do wish the bosses were a little bit harder...the only reason I died on them was simply because I didn't know what to do; as soon as I did they almost became pushovers.\n\nFor the size and scope it's aiming for, ITSP executes very well. Other than one zone that has you fumbling around in the dark (for all of about 5 minutes), I never got frustrated and enjoyed pushing forward, exploring and seeing what's around the next corner.\n\nWord of advice, though: if you're aiming to get all the collectables, scour as you go.  There's no way of seeing their location on the map, so it can be quite difficult to find things later on when the whole map is uncovered and you don't remember where you did or didn't pick them up.  I don't think it would work well to put the locations of them on the map, but it would have been nice if the developer added icons for the ones you had picked up so you would know where not to look.\n\nAnyways, all around a good, quick and fun game.","November 14, 2014","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It includes vast maps with a lot of space to explore filled enemy minions as well as some boss monsters/mechas and really nice puzzles.\n\nBy far the best thing about this game has, to me, is each chapter's highly distinctive atmosphere and playstyle.

The controls are SMOOTH.\n\nThe gameplay is mostly focused on environmental puzzles. Combat can be hectic but all save points heal you to full and they are frequent enough that you don't really have to worry that much about getting hit outside of boss battles. It's quite strictly linear- don't expect to sequence break or do levels out of order. Nevertheless you can and should backtrack to collect upgrades that were blocked off before.\n\nThey really got the atmosphere right, too.  It feels like you are a tiny tresspasser on a violently hostile, starkly alien planet, completely alone and carefully blazing a trail into the heart of the beast to strike where it is most vulnerable.\n\nI only have one real complaint- it seemed a little short.

It combines all of the greatest elements from a metroid-vania style 2-D platformer with some really impressive physics and visuals.\n\nGraphics: The game boasts a very impressive art-style throughout. The dark and ominous alien life-forms that you battle througout the game really exemplify this art style. As you explore the relatively large game-world, you will come across a series of diverse and unique landscapes. From ocean caverns to mechanical factories, the game provides a relatively aesthetic treat.\n\nGameplay: This game plays a lot like your typical metroid-vania game. It does mix it up quite a bit by throwing in a series of interesting physics puzzles. While I never really got caught up on these puzzles, they did break up the pace quite nicely. The combat in the game is very simple. It handles like a typical 2-D shooter, with a relatively sparse variety of weapons and enemies. Over-all, the combat rarely felt difficult or over-whelming (Especially the final boss). In terms of difficulty, you'll find that this game is a cake-walk.\n\nReplayability: In the single-player aspect, I wouldn't really recommend it to people who are looking for a deep and lengthy game. The single-player story will last you approximately 5 hours to beat. While the game does encourage you to return to previous levels once you unlock more tools to unlock some concept art and movies, this content is very short-winded, and will probably only take most people an additional hour.\n\nIn addition to the relatively short single-player campaing, there are a few multiplayer game-modes. While I tried them out in single-player, these were clearly meant to be played with at least another player. Unfortuantely there aren't many players online, so you'll need to find other users that own the game (or gather your friends to play locally). I really can't say much about the multi-player due to the fact that I never really got into it, but it could provide for a significantly longer play-time if you have a few willing friends.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this game to anyone looking for a unique metroid-vania game.","August 11, 2015","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You are this alien and his planet is taken over by this messed up junk. Not really sure what the ultimate goal is, everything is wordless. I think you are supposed to look for…something. You have a multitude of tools – laser blaster, info scanner, shield, grabber claw, drill, and I thought I got one other, but can’t recall right now. You use the various tools to get through different areas. If you are kind of stuck you can use the info scanner to give you an idea what to do. One spot I got so stuck I had to look it up online…  But you fly along and there are some enemies that damage you, some spots have orbs to heal you, checkpoints also heal, etc. You have a main objective and there are other pickups, but you are free to roam pretty much anywhere, so long as you have the tools to get through an area. Controls were tight, though a controller would be nicer (hey I ordered one!) than keyboard I think. Mouse aims, twin stick style. Music was alright. Graphics were cartoony but decent. Some of the stuff was very weird looking, which I liked. For the most part, play is intuitive and fun.

If they ever come up with a difficulty slider for motor control, I would never leave this game ever. I will probably replay the intro a few times (where skill level required is fairly low) just for the joy of the artwork.","May 23, 2015","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The music comes in at the right time, giving a nice isolation felling. The bosses design is breathtaking, the controls are easy to get used to. However, not every game is perfect, you have at least 4 hours of gameplay untill you complete the entire game. There are 2 other minigames, which are entertaining, but it doesn't last forever. But if you like metrovania style game, give it a try. :)","May 29, 2014","true","13.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Basically you fly around in a small flying saucer and solve small puzzles while fighting off enemies and gigantic bosses. As you travel through the shadow planet you will get new abilities that allow you to backtrack to previous areas to open new areas like any Metroidvania type game, though most of the collectibles you find by backtracking are concept art pieces and short movie clips.\n\nThe art style and music create a very nice atmosphere, and the controls are fairly smooth. Most of the special abilities you get are very creative and fun to use, my favorite being the buzzsaw. There's not a lot of tutorials or hints, but there's an objective marker and you get an info tool you can point at things to find out how to interact with them.\n\nAll-in-all it was a very good game in my opinion and it's only about 8 hours to play through the entire game and find all of the collectibles. I recommend picking it up sometime when it's on sale.","April 28, 2014","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A couple that come to mind are Limbo and the recent Rayman games. I still need solid mechanics, but a unique sense of style can elevate an otherwise solid but unexceptional game to something special. Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet is a perfect example. It's a solid ​Metroidvania game with a decent-size map, a nice variety of tools and weapons, and some clever puzzles and boss fights. The movement of the ship and the physics of the environment are also exceptionally well implemented. None of it is groundbreaking, but not every game has to be revolutionary. It does what it does very well, and with flawless design in both UI design and art direction.","September 24, 2015","true","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It combines all of the greatest elements from a metroid-vania style 2-D platformer with some really impressive physics and visuals.\n\nGraphics: The game boasts a very impressive art-style throughout. The dark and ominous alien life-forms that you battle througout the game really exemplify this art style. As you explore the relatively large game-world, you will come across a series of diverse and unique landscapes. From ocean caverns to mechanical factories, the game provides a relatively aesthetic treat.\n\nGameplay: This game plays a lot like your typical metroid-vania game. It does mix it up quite a bit by throwing in a series of interesting physics puzzles. While I never really got caught up on these puzzles, they did break up the pace quite nicely. The combat in the game is very simple. It handles like a typical 2-D shooter, with a relatively sparse variety of weapons and enemies. Over-all, the combat rarely felt difficult or over-whelming (Especially the final boss). In terms of difficulty, you'll find that this game is a cake-walk.\n\nReplayability: In the single-player aspect, I wouldn't really recommend it to people who are looking for a deep and lengthy game. The single-player story will last you approximately 5 hours to beat. While the game does encourage you to return to previous levels once you unlock more tools to unlock some concept art and movies, this content is very short-winded, and will probably only take most people an additional hour.\n\nIn addition to the relatively short single-player campaing, there are a few multiplayer game-modes. While I tried them out in single-player, these were clearly meant to be played with at least another player. Unfortuantely there aren't many players online, so you'll need to find other users that own the game (or gather your friends to play locally). I really can't say much about the multi-player due to the fact that I never really got into it, but it could provide for a significantly longer play-time if you have a few willing friends.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this game to anyone looking for a unique metroid-vania game.","August 11, 2015","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet says ♥♥♥♥ that, you're a flying saucer, now fly around and shoot things. What follows is an incredibly stylish adventure through the dark corridors of the namesake world, where your lone alien must battle horrible tenticled monstrosities and locate useful tools to open new paths, in typical genre fashion. The overall length is noticbly short, especially for a Metroidvania, but it it's a solid experience the whole way through. Combat is not particularly challenging, and although you can take only a few hits, checkpoints are frequent. The puzzles are also not overly challenging, when compared to, say, Guacamelee, and the game lacks the insane shinespark-style secrets that a game like Metroid: Zero Mission has- overall I might term ITSP a "Metroidvania-lite", perhaps unsurprising given its origins as an Xbox Live Arcade game (I had a similar experince with a game called Shadow Complex, which I managed to 100% the first time I played it, without using a guide). The game exploits its physics engine wherever possible, giving you a crane-game claw to manipulate objects and enemies, and things like strong winds and underwater currents, map-orientation-changing rotating rooms, and laser-reflection puzzles. There are even segments where you must guide a rocket through a narrow, zig-zagging tunnel to hit an otherwise out-of-reach switch. The tools are varied and fun to use, though at least one, the shield, isn't actually necessary to complete the game. It also has some excellent, screen-filling bosses, which as per standard, test your ability to use a recently-acquired powerup. There are a handful of secret areas to find, which reward the player with concept art and short cutscenes that show the origins of the shadow creatures. I haven't tried the multiplayer modes, though, so I can't speak for them, but I enjoyed the singeplayer enough that I completed the other like, 7/8ths of the game in one sitting. This game's been out a while already, so if you haven't given it a try and you love games for the sake of fun and artistic value, you've been missing out.

You are this alien and his planet is taken over by this messed up junk. Not really sure what the ultimate goal is, everything is wordless. I think you are supposed to look for…something. You have a multitude of tools – laser blaster, info scanner, shield, grabber claw, drill, and I thought I got one other, but can’t recall right now. You use the various tools to get through different areas. If you are kind of stuck you can use the info scanner to give you an idea what to do. One spot I got so stuck I had to look it up online…  But you fly along and there are some enemies that damage you, some spots have orbs to heal you, checkpoints also heal, etc. You have a main objective and there are other pickups, but you are free to roam pretty much anywhere, so long as you have the tools to get through an area. Controls were tight, though a controller would be nicer (hey I ordered one!) than keyboard I think. Mouse aims, twin stick style. Music was alright. Graphics were cartoony but decent. Some of the stuff was very weird looking, which I liked. For the most part, play is intuitive and fun. I did kind of get bored of it after an hour, but that might have been because I wanted to play F3 instead. I’d definitely recommend the game though. It’s challenging but easy enough to be casual.","November 5, 2015","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
