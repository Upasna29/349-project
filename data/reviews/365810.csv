The 1st American Volunteer Group, nicknamed the Flying Tigers, were a group of US pilots who fought for China during WWII. The game itself is based around this group and the campaign missions are based on real operations that took place during the War. The two factions in the game are the Allies and the Japanese, currently the campaign only lets you fly Ally aircraft but you can fly Japanese aircraft in the other game modes.\n\nPresentation\nFlying Tigers is, overall, a good looking game. The graphics aren’t exactly cutting edge and some of the ground textures aren’t brilliant but they get the job done and they do it well. All of the aircraft models look good and, to my eye, look reasonably realistic. For the most part, visual effects are good, I particularly like how bullets actually leave holes in the aircraft. The only visual effect that I thought was sub-par was rain, it doesn’t really fit with the overall look of the game and missions where it’s raining seem to look worse, graphically, than other missions. As for menus and the user interface they’re both very good. The menu is simple and easy to navigate while the UI is useful as well as fully customisable in the sense that anything can be turned on or off as you please.\n\nGame Modes\nFlying Tigers features several different ways to play both online and offline. Up first we have the campaign I briefly mentioned earlier, the missions here are all based on real operations during the war but there’s no real storyline to it, each mission is effectively standalone. Currently there are eight missions to play with the rest being released as the game progresses through development. Next we have the offline Dogfighting mode, this mode allows you to choose any aircraft in the game (apart from bombers) to fly and then allows you to choose how many aircraft you want to fight and what type of aircraft you want to fight (currently you can’t pick a selection) as well as what map and weather conditions you want. Similarly to Dogfight there’s the challenge mode, currently there are only two challenges available but these have you destroy as many enemy aircraft you can with a certain aircraft before you’re shot down. The last offline game mode is free flight, the name says it all for this one really. All of the offline game modes have two difficulty levels (Rookie and Normal) with a Hard mode coming later in development. Last, and currently least, we have Online battles featuring up to 16 players, unfortunately the multiplayer seems to be completely dead, only one server came up on the server browser and it was completely empty. Fingers crossed multiplayer will be become more active as the game progresses and more people buy into the game.\n\nGameplayFlying Tigers is very much an arcade dogfighting experience. Obviously the game is centred on air-air combat but there are also ground and naval targets in some of the missions. I must say, combat is a lot of fun, especially when you’re chasing enemies while being chased yourself. All of the aircraft feature at least one forward facing gun and some have backwards facing guns controlled by AI apart from some scripted events. As well as guns there are also bombs and torpedoes used by some of the aircraft to take out the ground and naval targets I mentioned. The main reason this game is more towards the arcade side of things rather than simulation is due to the game’s controls. It’s also an arcade game due to a slow motion ability that you can use (and recharge as it doesn’t last forever) during combat, I had a lot of fun messing around with this ability and it does also make it easier to hit targets which frequently comes in handy.\n\nControls\nThe first thing worth mentioning is that you’re given a hell of a lot of choice in the game for input devices. You can either play with: just a mouse, a keyboard and mouse, a gamepad and even a flight stick/HOTAS setup. The main thing which makes this game so much of an arcade game, which I personally don’t like, is the limitations in terms of aircraft manoeuvrability. You can’t bank the plane more than 90° manoeuvres that you can do in other games. The devs have explained that this limitation is there due to limitations with the camera and also to stop us “fiddling with controls unnecessarily” (whatever that means) but the devs have said we may see these limitations removed at some point in the future so fingers crossed. With the most recent update one of these limitations has been removed from the game hence I’ve removed it from my review, hopefully the other one will go too. Other than that issue the controls are great, the planes all feel as responsive as they should (obviously a large bomber is less responsive than a small fighter aircraft).\n\nAudio\nAudio is largely very good in Flying Tigers. The sound effects are all very high quality and make the aircraft sound somewhat real. The game’s sound track is good and fits well with the game, definitely gives it an action film kind of feel. Lastly the voice acting in the game is all done reasonably well though there were a couple of times where I was left wondering if the correct accent was used. One thing worth mentioning is that not all of the dialogue lines for the missions are in the game yet since it’s still in Early Access but I imagine these will be added in later updates.\n\nMiscellaneous\nThe game has already received several different updates and the devs are active on the forums which is nice to see\nThere are already quite a few different aircraft for both factions with more coming soon\nThe game already has nine different maps, each with several different weather conditions, with more coming soon\nMost aircraft have different paint jobs to choose from though you can’t choose different paint jobs during the campaign (due to the devs wanting to keep the game historically accurate)\nIf you’d like to see an offline Dogfight, check out my gameplay video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sZpZIPumk0\n\nVerdict\nWorth Purchasing.\n\nFlying Tigers is a great arcade dogfighting game with good graphics, quite a few different aircraft and plenty of content already. If you enjoy dogfighting games there’s no question you’ll enjoy this one too and it’s only going to get better as it progresses through Early Access.\n\nReview Copy Provided.\n\nNo drama, Just Reviews.\n\nEl K.","September 14, 2015","true","6.6"," 88 of 99 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","88","99","3","20"

So some optimization on rain is needed. It's not on every map so that's good :)\n\nKB+Mouse controls can be quite hard, so using some other input could be better, but no needed.\n\nOVERALL:\n\nThis could be very well finished game, does not feel like early access.

You can fly in multiple territories and there is also a variety of planes to choose from. Your task is simple: destroy the enemies. Sometimes they're on the ground, sometimes in the air.\n\nPros:    Graphics | This game looks amazing. The plane models look realistic and the environment is beautiful, too. Water also looks way nice that expected. Regarding animations, I was impressed with explosions that bombs cause.\nWeapons | Different weapons are attached to your plane. You can fire a machine gun, rockets, and drop bombs. I like how you're not limited with a ridiculously small amount of ammo, but you have unlimited quantities of it. You only need to be careful not to overheat your machine gun. Bombs and rockets regenerate themselves after some wait.\nMissions | There are 12 missions included into the campaign. They all include cutscenes, that are voice acted, and some story. Apart from missions, there are also game modes like Time Trial and a "free flying" mode.\nPerformance | Based on how this game looks, you would assume that it uses a lot of system resources, but it really doesn't. The game runs just fine even on high details and shadows.\nSoundtrack | In my opinion, the soundtrack is just awesome. I spent a few minutes on the credits screen just so I could listen to the music without any game sounds. Then, I figured out that there is a soundtrack DLC available on Steam :P\nControls | I confess: I suck at flight simulators. But this game really makes it easy for everyone to maneuver their planes like a pro, if they only spend some time in game practicing. There are a lot of shortcuts on the keyboard that are really useful, like side-flips and rear view.\nSteam Integration | This game has Achievements, Trading Cards, Leaderboards and Cloud support. Just as it should be.\nCons:    Lack of Multiplayer Players | Well, I rarely ever came across another player on the multiplayer servers, which is really a shame. But I really love the campaign, so there's not real damage for me. I know that some people prefer multiplayer, though, so do keep this paragraph in mind if you're one of those people.\nNo Linux/MacOS Support | Sadly, you can only run this game on Windows. Games are paying attention to alternative operating systems nowadays so it's a shame that this game isn't one of those.\nControls | I was a bit unsure if I should put this in or not, since I already mentioned that controls are, in my opinion, good. But there seem to be some people who generally like the controls, but do not like the way this game plays with a mouse. On the other hand, I loved flying with my mouse, so I guess this is just a thing you can get used to.\nThe final verdict:The game looks great, plays great and sounds great. Since it's only in Early Access, I'm quite happy with the content it's currently offering. Although I'm not used to flying, I found it quite enjoyable in this game. There are 12 campaign for you to complete and, if you get bored, there are also free flying, time trial and other modes. Most people, me included, have noticed that this game runs great on most computers, which is definitely a plus.\nIf you're into flying simulators or war games, definitely consider buying this game!\n\nGreetings,\nBirdCute\n\nNote that my copy of this game was obtained for free for reviewing purposes.

After the game was launched, the first thing I noticed was a soundtrack in the main menu. Without a minor doubt, it was amazing. I enjoyed it while setting the game up. Music in the game itself is quite dynamic and non-irritating as well.\n\nControl. Control can be adjusted by your own, depending on your preferences. You may use either Mouse + Keyboard or the controller. As for me, I started with M + K.\nAfter training flight was over, I got the instructions quite right and dealt with the first task fast enough. By the way, you can also choose among three difficulty levels, from beginner to advanced.\n\nGraphics. Overall, the graphics are good enough; details look pretty realistic and gamma does not make your eyes tired even after few hours of gaming in a row. I was impressed by detalization of aircraft though, each small piece is drawn to the fullest.\n\nGameplay. There are four different play modes (except multiplayer) in the game. You can fight against other squadrons, escort Allied bombers, and attack ground troops and infantry by yourself using a number of different tricks and techniques.\nEach aspect of the game is completely different, there is nothing that makes you bored despite few hours of straight play; most probably, you’d like to go into it again and again.\n\nMultiplayer. The only shortage at the moment is the lack of players in multiplayer. Frankly, I failed to try this mode at all. However, the server will be hopefully filled so we can enjoy the game each night really soon.\nKeep in mind, the game is still in the early access. Developers improve the game consistently, so new updates and all the fixes are coming out in time.\nIf you’re still thinking whether to purchase the game or not, you’d better do.

The controls are not super easy like War Thunder, but it's using a virtual joystick as the controls which is great.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/0FnOBuu7TlU\n\nThe game is in the middle in terms of an arcade game and a simulator, but more on the arcade side. It has a good amount of content with a campaign that has a varying degree of missions to play, a good tutorial, and it looks pretty decent too in terms of the visuals.\n\nIt also has a solo dog-fighting mode where you fight against AI pilot(s), battling it out in a handful of maps where you can control the wheather type and the number of enemies you face.\n\nThere's also a multiplayer mode but I'm leaning on the side that it's going to be dead pretty soon after launch, but thankfully there's that single player campaign and solo dog-fighting mode to give value to your purchase. although I do hope the devs add a multiplayer like scenario but with AI bots, and what would make this game a killer deal is if they add 2 player (or 4 player) online coop.\n\nOverall for the price that it's asking for it's a pretty good purchase, filled with great polish and a good amount of content.","August 20, 2015","true","1.2"," 34 of 51 people (67%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","67","34","51","4","8"

However, the fatal flaw in the current release is the joystick support. The controls are really designed for a game controller, and the joystick is essentially made to act like a joystick. To make a tight turn you can not simply turn the stickl and then pull back, as that only gets your roll up to about 45 degrees. Rather, you have to assign other buttons to emulate sharp maneuvers. For me, having full joystick control is really important, otherwise the game does not feel intuitive. Hope they fix that, otherwise it looks nice. I only flew the first couple missions, as I really got tired of the controls, but what I saw was impressive.","January 24","false","0.5"," 25 of 35 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","25","35","2","0"

It has amazing mouse & keyboard controls, amazing gameplay and graphics.\n\nThe planes fly so well, for example if you were to go up really high, your plane would stall (Pilot also will start to blackout if you do an immelman, which is cool). Then if you charged down, your plane would speed up rapidly. If that made you closer to the enemy plane you were fighting, you would do more damage. Another thing that is helpful to some is the Trazertime thing. It helps with aim quite a bit if you have shakey hands or are new, I don't use it myself, because I think it's unfair to the AI. The Trazertime only works in singleplayer though, do be warned.\n\nNow for graphics: This game is well optimized and I have never had a crash before or any lag. I think the explosions are incredible, and if you drive through it you get oil on your cockpit. Sending a plane into some trees and then seeing it explode and stay on fire for quite a while is loads of fun. If you land on the water, you can see that they took the time to make it nice and have wildlife in it [like whales, yay!]. The planes look so real with their cool paint jobs, even some fictional ones, like a zero painted with german symbols on it (not swastikas).\n\nIt also has multiplayer, which I do not remember blazing angels having, as well as a beatable campaign which was also lacking in blazing angels (darn you ice caves mission!). I must add again though, the controls are perfect.\n\nImportant note: You DO NOT need a controller for this game.","December 29, 2015","true","42.6"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Every dialog is full dubbed and that’s very professional. With the cinematic artwork it brings a lot of immersion. The graphics are great, the game looks very, very good, even the landscape is very detailed. In one moment you cross a huge grassland and in the moment you see a nice modelled city.\nThe Story is special, because it is based on the real world Fighter Group in WW2, they defended China against the Japanese Forces and their Planes got a special shark-mouth paintwork. You can re-enactment their legacy!\nThe second Game mode is the Free Flight Mode. In this mode you can try every plane and there are more than 20 at the Moment! More airplanes are coming soon. You can also choose between a varieties of decals.\nThe third Single player-Mode is the Dog-Fight, in this mode you can train your skills in a premade one-on-one. That’s pretty intense and the overall difficulty is pretty high (maybe I am bad in aviation). This Mode is good to calibrate your mouse, I self-explanatory how important it is, that you have full control over your fighter or bomber.\nI am sure that the multiplayer gets more Players, which is what I am looking for. Multiplayer mode are Capture the Flag, Team-Dogfight and a Deathmatch like Mode – named Master of the Skies. A huge reason is that, the game features NO Pay2Win or Micro transaction. So everything is on the line and you can get it without spending additional money to look good in multi-player.\nIt’s a good game, it features a lot of great air-combat action. I always like when the Dev’s are listening in Forums where you can ask questions and they provide a lot of information. This is huge point, for a game while the Game is in Early-Access Access.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Levathanboy/recommended/365810/","Levathanboy","cuban pete","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Levathanboy/","56 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nFT:SOC Is a game centred around the "Flying tigers," A combat group of american pilots sent over to asia to aid in the fight against the incoming japanese invasion. I personally like the game, but the game also has it's drawbacks;\n\nCons:\n- Semi clunly controls, Not too easy to steer, not too hard, atleast for mouse + keyboard people, I definitley suggest playing with an Xbox remote or something.\n- Landings tend to be pretty frustrating seeing as your plane will immidiately nose-dive if you go a tad too slow.\n- Enemies seem to zoom through trees at low altitude on some levels.\n- Bombing seems a little awkward in this game.\n\nAnd now for the pros:\n- Fast-ish paced combat, You can usually wipe the table with an enemy in a couple of seconds if you land all the shots.\n- Detailed and nice visuals. I'm totally digging that comicy feel.\n- Multiplayer is pretty good.\n- Nice UI, Hud dosen't interrupt gameplay flow as much as some other games.\n\nMy final verdict on the game is that it's a decent game if you're looking to play a not-so-serious air combat game. I'd suggest picking this up when it's on sale, but I have hope for the final game's release, which I am going to buy. Now, what're you waiting for? Go blow up some planes!

I was hesitant to play it because I wasn’t sure if I was going to enjoy it. I immediately feel in love with the game. The controls were easy to learn and I have gotten a lot better since I first began playing. I enjoy being able to choose the casual mode that I recommend for all players who have never played a game similar to this one. The graphics are sick and you can tell the attention to detail that the creators put in. I love these new games coming out that are based off an older time in history because they are able to give a sense of what actually happened, but still being able to provide an entertaining game for all of its players. The different game modes will appeal to many different types of players whether you are a causal player who likes to spend his time playing the campaign, or a competitive gamer who likes playing multiplayer.  Overall I think this is a must try game for anyone who is looking for a new game to play even if you’re not familiar with this style of game.","May 13","true","6.6"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

When you first get into the game you are greeted with amazing visuals, effects, music and a pleasing user interface. Flying Tigers is a well rounded game that manages to capture the true essence of aerial combat and the world war shooter feel. The graphics are great, the explosions feel powerful and are a blast to look at. The music gives a very wartime feel and very much helps with the immersion. The conrtols are very easy to get used to and the tutorial is very helpful. The voice activing in this game is also incredible.\n\nRunning this on max settings on my PC allowed me to view so many amazing things about this game and its stunning visuals. Not to mention, these historical battles are epic! There was only one con I could find with the great game. It was that with a dual-screen monitor, the game would not border off the one screen and when the cursor entered the second, it could tab out.\n\nOther than an easy fix, Flying Tigers: Shadows Over China is a well made, scripted, coded, visual, and sounding game. There is a lot to do and the whole user interface is so easy to work with. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes aerial combat games.","May 18","true","10.6"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

The game is so polished already. I wanna stress that because usualy early Acces is terrible and even some recent AAA titles that launched are not as polished as this game already is ;)\nIt basically all the settings that pc gamers love and need, yes even 21:9 support!!! :D\nAlso you get a bunch of input device settings to choose from, some of them are keyboard + mouse, just keyboard, flystick and some of them have an arcade and other versions to choose from. I gotta be honest that I'm no flying game pro (more to that later) but I'm sure everybody can find some option that he likes.\n\nLike I already said I'm not that good in flying any kind of vehicle in any game. I usually just crash in 10 seconds (for those of you who know bf3, I crashed on the 2nd coop mission over 20 times until I got the heli to fly 1 minute and crashed every time I tried to land ;O). With that being said this game surely has a nice tutorial and keeps it at a pace where even flying newbies like me can figure out how to stay in the air. I actually crashed rarely in this game and I'm even able to shoot stuff while I'm flying.\n\nI don't think I need to say anything about the performance since I already said that the game is polished and so is the performance. I get more then 60 fps and never get any dips.\nThe graphic looks also pretty good and the soundtrack gets you really hyped ;)\n\nAll in all if you are a flying game fan, just wanna look in to this genre or just want to get better at flying vehicles in video games in general then this game is definitely for you! It teaches newbies and has plenty of stuff to do for veterans. There is a campaign, mp, free flight and a dogfight mod where you can play survival.\n\n___________________________________________________________\nDas deutsche Review startet hier:\n\nBevor ich etwas zum Spiel selbst sage möchte ich erst einmal den Entwickler loben, da das Spiel für einen Early Access schon Astrein läuft. Das Spiel läuft flüssig, es gibt keine Bugs und generell nichts zu meckern, da können sich so manch andere Unternehmen und sogar die AAA Spiele Hersteller eine große Scheibe abschneiden :D.\n\nDas Spiel bietet alle Einstellungen die der moderne PC Spieler braucht. Von diversen Graphik Einstellungen (sogar 21:9 Format) bis hin zu zig Controller Einstellungen, die von Tastatur und Maus bis Flugstick gehen und selbst dort noch unter normaler und arcade Einstellung unterschieden werden kann. Hier finden jeder etwas!\n\nNun ja ich muss jetzt erstmal gestehen das ich ein Nieten Pilot in jedem Video Spiel bin. Also Referenz nenn ich hier mal BF3, dort hab ich in der zweiten Coop Mission gute 2 Stunden gebracht bis ich endlich mal länger als 10 Sekunden fliegen konnte damit ich nicht andauernd abstürzte. Oder auch in Saints Row 4 hab ich in der ersten Flieger Mission 6 Anläufe gebraucht. Wie ihr seht ist fliegen bei mir echt ein Problem ;P\nIn diesem Spiel hingegen trat meine "Ich setzt mich in den Flieger und er explodiert" Krankheit aber nicht auf.\nMan wird hier im Tutorial sehr gut an das Spiel herangeführt und lernt Schritt für Schritt, fliegen, schießen auf stationäre Ziele, danach bewegliche Ziele und so weiter.\n\nVon der Performance ist wie schon gesagt alles tip top. Ich für meinen Teil bleibe immer über 60 fps und was viel wichtiger ist die fps sind stabil während man spielt. Auch die Grafik und der Soundtrack sind spitze.\n\nZusammenfassend kann ich das Spiel an alle Flugspiel-Liebhaber, an die die in das Genre mal reinschnuppern möchten oder an alle die wie ich eine Piloten-Niete in Videospielen sind und dies ausbessern wollen empfehlen. Das Spiel hat sogar für die Veteranen unter euch sehr viele Modis um euch lange zu unterhalten. Die Modie sind die folgenden: Einzelspieler Kampagne, Mehrspieler, Freier Flugmodus und Dogflight wo man eine Art Überlebensmodus spielen kann.","March 19","true","1.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The tone of the game is pretty corny and overall it's just arcade styled with the western comic style menu UI and all that\n\nGameplay wise it is pretty okay for a air combat game, plane selections are okay in number. About 20 planes or so.\nStory/Plot wise it focuses mainly on the Allies, no Axis campaign or anything for now.\n\nI played on normal difficulty and the game is challenging with a lot of retrying on missions, so the game does have difficulty which is a good thing in the age of super-easy-modo games\n\nRealistic flight enthusiasts might have a hard time stomaching some of the "moves" in the game like how a propeller plane can pull off a weak Pugachev Cobra to brake in mid-air\n\nBottom line, it's a pretty fun game if you don't take it seriously and just embrace the arcadey tone and game mechanics.\n\nIf you want a serious aerial combat game, something else would be better.","December 30, 2015","true","5.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

And more often than less, getting disappointed with rushed and unpolished gameplay and content, and you feeling like you got robbed of your money and time.\nIt is a breath of fresh air to play games like Flying Tigers. It is one of those games where the price you pay and the experience you get are perfectly matched and every minute play is time well spent. It is these type of games that makes me excited for the gaming community.\n\nMy System:\nI ran Flying Tigers on my Windows Desktop with the following:\n•	GeForce GTX 960 4gb\n•	Intel Core i5-4440 @ 3.1GHz\n•	16gb of DDR3 RAM\n\nThe Basics:\nPerformance - With my rig, with maxed out graphics, at 1080p, I got solid and stable 60 frames per second with frames dropping slightly during high content instances during campaign but nothing visually noticeable.\n\nJoystick needed?? - Yes. Or at least a console remote. Keyboard and mouse inputs are not bad, and definitely playable, but I found myself on numerous occasions overshooting the target, flying in circles around ground targets and getting frustrated over simple controls.\n\nGraphics - Well-polished and surprisingly on par graphics even compared to some AAA games. It is nothing ground-breaking and certainly won’t stand out as something different. But from small details on the plane to the massive open worlds filled with contest, they get it right.\n\nAudio - To put it clear and simple, from machine guns blasting to numerous different characters and accents, the quality is excellent and coincides with the game perfectly. Even the main menu soundtrack sets the mood for the action packed gameplay.\n\nGeneral Gameplay - The game runs smoothly, looks great, sounds great and plays great. With almost no bugs or crashes, this type of gameplay is what every other gaming studio should strive to achieve at launch date.\n\n\nSingle Player:\nSingle player consists of of:\nCampaign\nDogfight\nSelect Challenge\nFree Flight\nThe Campaign consists out of 12 mission, which have huge variety in where you play, the type of mission, planes and weaponry. It is both entertaining and well written. But the progression from mission to mission does not flow from one to the next well enough as to keep you wanting to play one more. Yet it adds something new to the WW2 series as you play in locations set in China-Burma-India, which is accompanied with excellent voice acting, realistic gameplay and outcomes.\nDogfight and Select challenge are basically the Campaign without the voice acting and missing introduction, but add a couple of hours of extra flying fun to the mix.\n\nMultiplayer:\nMultiplayer consists of:\nJoin Online Battle\nHost Online Battle\nSteam Leader boards\nPilot Record\nAt the moment, there are minimal players online as it is almost impossible to find a match. But as the game is in early release, I expect the number of players to exponentially increase.\n\nSomething to think about:\nYou are getting what you are paying for here. This is a WW2 aerial combat game. And that’s it. There is a Single player and a Multiplayer and it follows the usual old recipe of flying around trying to shoot down as many enemy planes or destroying ground targets. It’s nothing new or revolutionary, but it doesn’t have to be. It’s a well polish game that delivers much than what you expect. It reminds me of the good old days when games use to be simpler and more to the point. And that’s exactly what Flying Tiger’s is.\n\n\nWill I play it for more than a week?\nAt the moment no. As it stands any average PC gamer will be able to complete the Campaign and other single player elements in under a week, BUT when the multiplayer segment gets up and running I am sure that countless more hours will be spent flying over the beautiful China-Burma-India landscapes trying to gun down opponents.\n","May 22","true","5.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It already feels like a well polished game and I have not encountered any game breaking bugs. Controls feel responsive and I have not noticed any lag. It's a good balance between arcade and realism. Graphics are very nice and you can tweak them to make them more relaistic or cinematic. Game runs at 60 FPS maxed out on my medium range AMD PC. As far as gameplay goes, there are plenty of modes to try and tons of planes to fly. All with unique feel to them. Multiplayer was a lot of fun playing with a friend but there are not many other people playing it at the moment. I assume because the game is still new. I really enjoyed the historic aspect of the game. It really felt like I was in the middle of WW2 battles that felt authentic.

The control mechanism exhibits what pilots refer to as "dynamic negative stability" where the more you move, the more the aircraft deviates from where you want to go.  Throttle response is luidcrously slow and the aerodynamics are a joke.   The biggest threat in the game is randomly running into one of your drone teammates. The campaign is very short and childish, with the 'script' full of anachronisms, cultural cluelessness, and borderline racism.  Worst of all, however, is the company behind it:  "Ace ♥♥♥♥♥♥" apparenty can't take constructive criticism and LIES about nonexistant community guideline violations because it's too up its own backside to fix actual problems in the game and its associated content.

I`m playing with a Steam Controller and set the controls ingame on Arcade-Mode.\n- I`m satisfied with the ingame sounds of the flying aircrafts or the guns.\n- Singleplayer campaign was really fun as the different mission had some different settings and objectives. In one mission I`m just training with dummys while in another mission I`m hunting other aircrafts... or bombing an enemy base... or sitting as an gunner at the backside and shooting at enemy aircrafts with a mounted machine gun... and so on...\n- I can choose different aircrafts from either the american side or the japanese in the custom mission mode (dogfight), freeflight mode or the multiplayer mode\n- I'm running the game on highest settings at 90+ FPS. (Intel I5-4570 @3,20 GHz and GTX 780)\n- I can crash into trees for fun.\n\n\nCons:- I don't really like the soundtrack in the main menu. The first half of the song is nice, but the second half is just too epic for my taste.\n- The scenery is beautiful, however I`d like to see more different and maybe more detailed trees.\n- Sadly the Multiplayer feature is almost non-existent... I rarely see other people playing or many other servers being online...\n- "Tap the B-Button (Controller) to drop a bomb / Hold the B-Button to switch the Camera-Mode to see where to bomb..." Well, if I hold the B-Button to switch Camera, I drop a bomb first and then switch into a Cam where I can`t fly and can't see were I'm dropping bombs... I hope for a fix.\n\n\nOverall:It is quite a solid and well made early access game. I didn't believed the game wasn't finished yet and there's still more to come and see in the future. I'd say, that everyone who likes to try some action packed flying in an WWII setting should consider buying this game.\n\n\n\n\nNote, that my copy of this game was gifted to me for testing purposes, but it didn't affect my objectivity of this review.","March 23","true","2.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

All the small details have been thought out. It runs and works well on both a PC and a laptop (with tracker pad). I tried it with both and I actually preferred it on the laptop. If you're a laptop gamer give this a try and make the most of your tracker pad.\n\nThe controls all make sense. There's nothing clunky about them. There's nothing new to adjust to as other games I have played use the same keyboard controls. There are multiple ways to fly so you can choose what is right for you.\n\nThere has been a lot of work put into each and every one of the planes and there's plenty of planes to choose from.\n\nI would say that ground detail could be improved on but I understand if there has been a sacrifice made as the maps are expansive and in the end, this is a sky based game focused on dog fights.\n\nI was sad to not find any online players but I'm glad that online has been made an option. With dedicated servers being and option you can have great fun with your friends. Although when I played there weren't any online players, there was a server there for anyone to hang out in.\n\nThere is a great well thought out campaign which covers everything so where online is lacking players you can still have fun on your own.\n\nSmall details make this game and I love it.

My review is based on the game at this time, however, I know, and so should others, that this game is an "Early Access Game," and as such, changes, patches, possibly more content, etc., are expected to occur.\nPros:\n1. Works well with an XBOX One Gamepad.\n2. The graphics are decent.  Planes seem to look decent. Explosions are nice.\n3. Control schemes can be anywhere from simplistic (push button for maneuvers, auto-rudder control), to medium (giving more control, such as controlling Rudder, and Roll, etc.).\n4. No detected FPS or Stuttering issues. (smooth)\n5. There are Gunner positions in the aircraft that have Machineguns.\n6. The Campaign has a variation of different missions, including Dogfights, Bombing, Torpedo, Bomber protection/escort, etc.\n7. There is the classic/standard "track your target" ability, to keep better eye on your prey during a Dogfight.\n8. The control-binding and re-binding works well.\n9. Personal Pro - I enjoyed the Campaign, and enjoy the game in general.\nCons:\n1. Main campaign seems short to me.\n2. Free-flight Maps seem confined/small (though not ridiculously small).\n3. There is no Cockpit view, and the two main views are both from the external and behind your aircraft.  To me, it is a "con," though to others it may not be (Unless I missed the option during view-change to select cockpit).\n\nEarly Access - So I expect some issues/bugs, and changes (though i'm not detecting any discernable issues/bugs).\n\nGame is Early Access. It is also a simplistic game. I believe it is meant to be. It is one of those games you quickly hop into, if you want a quick Dogfight, or to drop some quick bombs, play a game against some other people in WWII-style fighter aircraft. It is not meant to be a "photo-realistic" "Simulator." For what it seems to be trying to be...it seems to be, and does a good job at being.\n\nFor the most part, 95%, if you are looking for what I described, I'd say I recommend it. Just expect there to be changes, possible bugs, added content, etc., since the game is still in its infancy.\n\nPc Specs:\n-OS = Win7 x64 /dual boot/ Kali Linux\n-Motherboard = ASUS ROG MAXIMUS VIII EXTREME\n-CPU = Intel Core I7-6700K 4.00 GHz > OC'd @ 4.6Ghz\n(Thermal Compound = Arctic Silver 5 High-Density Polysynthetic Silver)\n-Liquid CPU Cooler = Corsair Hydro Series H90 140 mm High Performance\n-RAM = G.SKILL 32GB (2 x 16GB) Ripjaws V Series DDR4 PC4-24000 @ 3000+ MHZ\n(CAS 14, 14, 14, 34)\n-Video Card = EVGA GTX 980ti 6 Gig\n-Main Drive = Samsung 850 Pro 1 Tb SSD\n-Storage Drives = 2 x 2Tb Hybrid Drives;\n256 Gb SSD\n-PSU - EVGA Gold 1300w\n-Keyboard = Logitech G19s\n-Mouse = Corsair M95","May 21","true","6.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Do you miss GOOD aerial dogfights and heartpounding action in a fighter plane game?  Well I believe Flying Tigers: Shadows Over China (FT:SOC) to be the game you've been pining for.\n\nEssentially FT:SOC comes across as an arcade flight game where you pilot various World War 2 aircraft that took place during various missions around China. It is worth noting that the developer coded their own game engine (SkyLight3D) just to make this game the way they wanted, so immediate kudos goes to them for that.\n\nIt's actually a great looking game, for the cost I fully expected it to not have much detail in the textures and be more focused on the gameplay but the developers seem to have got the balance right between the two.  I play this on full cinematic graphic settings at 1080p and it runs smooth as a hot knife through butter, even when recording/streaming gameplay it rarely gets even a whisker close to 40fps and stays around 60+ fairly regularly. (FYI I'm running an AMD 8 core, 8Gb ram, 2Gb R9 380 PC)\n\nThe solo campaign is pretty good so far, I'm currently 4 missions in and although I'm no history buff, I get the feeling that the missions have been crafted with quite a considerable amount of detail and thus far they have been great fun, trying the different variants of planes helps keep things very fresh.\n\nMultiplayer however is currently a little bit lacking due to slow traffic, I did try and host a game for a while but sadly nobody dropped in but it definately works and I feel this would be a killer game to play with a bunch of friends!\n\nThe settings are really feature filled too with nearly every option avaliable either in the pre-game config loader or in-game via the keybindings where you can even attach a proper fightstick to give better control to your plane.\n\nOverall this game is definately worth buying and if you are a fan of this sort of game I recommend you buy into it, especially as it's only in early access right now and the developers are planning to put in more content.","May 17","true","2.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

How I perceived this game whether it’s positively or negatively is entirely up to me.\n\nFlying Tigers: Shadows over China is an Early Access Flying combat simulator that sets on Asia during World War II where Axis and Allies are contesting on air superiority control. There are many planes to choose from in Dogfight and Free Flight mode.\n\nPROS\n\n-The Arcade Gameplay it what makes the game good. There not much Arcade combat simulator nowadays and this game did it flawlessly.\n\n-The Campaign offers different mission in different countries which you are tasked to do different thing like bomb an airfield, hunt down enemy bombers, and defend your bombing run with your machinegun against enemy fighters.\n\n-The Sounds in the game are very well done, from the engine sound to the whirring mounted machine gun sounds really great.\n\n-The Controls are optimized on the M+KB but it’s much better if Joystick is used while playing this game. I tried using M+KB for a while then I switched to Joystick and I had a blast using the Joystick.\n\n-The Visual are superb for an Early Access Game and the UI is also well done.\n\n-Optimization of the game is just great, I have 100+FPS and never have any issues at the game.\n\n-No Microtransactions. The developers didn’t went full EA/SEGA/Ubisoft that alone makes this game 12/10\n\nCONS\n\n-No Cockpit view. I know it’s an Arcade flying simulator but having a cockpit view should make this game much better.\n\n-Multiplayer is non-existent currently. I hope many people can buy this game so it will be filled with dogfights everywhere.\n\n-The game have many contents right now, but let’s hope that more planes and places will be available as Early Access continues.\n\nOverall\n\nI miss going to arcade and play these kind of games and this one did delivered my childhood memories\nI recommend buying it even at full price as the developer are actually delivering contents with each update. I rate it 8.5/10\n\n","April 3","true","10.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The in flight controls seemed, at first, to be a little exagerated in it's movements with a keyboard and mouse but one of their most recent updates fixed that I believe seeing as it is now easier to control your aircraft using keyboard and mouse.   It is an early access awaiting TONS of potential should the developers keep swinging things in positive directions.  Don't expect to play this game on max settings just yet as it is very jerky on those settings, but even on the lowest (flat) setting, the game still looks amazing.  As for aerial combat, it is extremely fun and rewarding. this game also boasts a decent amount of aircraft, seeing as it is early access, with much more to come and has authentic paintjobs.

If you're looking for a sim, this game isn't for you.\n\n2. At times during the flight my monitor lost connection. I have a high end rig and it's never happened on any other game, but maybe it was a driver issue. It was still annoying though as at times I ran into the ground before my monitor came back on.\n\n3. There is no cockpit or nose cam. Only one view, a chase cam, which made it look like I was drunk behind the controls. I felt as if I was drifting around a lot and in a couple places you can lose the mission because you didn't stay in perfect formation.\n\n4. It's a fairly short campaign. Most of the time it's pretty easy, but there was part of one mission (4th last mission in the single player campaign) that was particularly hard, even on casual. After I finally beat it, the game crashed on me (the only time it ever crashed) forcing me to have to re-do this frustratingly difficult mission.\n\n5. Most of the time you don't have to take off or land, but there are a couple exceptions.\n\nBut overall I enjoyed the experience. I have a HOTAS joystick so that really helped. There's a nice variety of missions.\nDogfighting, hitting ground targets, torpedoing ships, strafing soldiers on the ground, shooting vickers machine guns from the topside of bombers and so on.\n\nNote to developers: If it had a nose cam it would be a huge improvement. It would actually make me feel like I had more control of my plane and improve the overall experience.","January 1","true","4.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Although I seem to be very impressed with this game having a much more realistic feel to it, as the landscape it so greatly made.  I thought that the trees with pretty sweet to just look at as I would fly low trying to take out enemy trucks.  The soundtrack in this game is awesome, I do not think that the developers could have picked a better soundtrack for this game.  The explosions are wonderful and I was stunned by the first explosion I seen, the sound and view of the explosions are all most just crazy.  One thing that I found to be really interesting is instead of just zooming for a better aim to shoot your targets, you zoom in while going into slow motion like a special boost.  Flying around is pretty smooth and the planes look great however, the game is fun but also challenging to play.  I really looking forward to seeing what this game becomes In the future.

When Microsoft flight simulator was created in 1976 by Bruce Artwick, he never intended that the pilots training on it were going to be flying there planes with a keyboard and mouse. If you look in the cockpits of airplanes you dont see a keyboard and mouse. When Flight simulator was finally release on IBM PC's in 1982 it was released and packaged with a joystick. As I remember it was a whole kit like box in huge packaging. Flight games no matter if they are sims or not are never intended to be played with a keyboard and mouse. It is just too complicated and there are way to many controls for that. As a matter of fact, all the people whinning about not being able to control this game with there keyboard and mouse should go out and buy Microsoft Flight Simulator for there PC and see how easy that game is to control with a keyboard and mouse. With that said Invest in a $20-$30 controller for your computer, retry the game and than recomment. Trust me you will not be dissapointed as the controller comes in handy in alot of other games too.................The game itself is pretty solid and the cotrols are decent, but there are a few things that need some work. For one the engine speed and percent of accel/decel need to be more centralized. For exaple the mission objective is center and top where the accel/decel should be and the accel/decel is top left where the mission object should be. I found myself trying to decel quickly and not realizing my current speed or engine RPM till it was to late. Also, I am confused about the mission I think its the fourth or fifth mission bombs over Rangoo or somthing in that nature. The second half you have to destroy like 30 bombers before they reach the airfield because when they reach the airfield they all split and its OV from there. They get to the airfield in 50 sec well the machine guns onboard fire for only 7 sec before they overheat than you have to wait 5 sec for them to cool off. And they dont die easily. Its about impossible to beat that mission on normal. Most mission have a set goal you need to distroy this many bombers to divert the attack but, this one doesnt. You have to destroy all of them and the airfield is obviously not very reinforced because it goes down faster than a prosti-tute when you give her $5. Needless to say I am stuck there and thats about as far as I have gotten for now. Im not one to play a game on easy but, Just to pass that mission it might be necessary.","January 4","true","2.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

Targeting and controls are slushy It's hard to hold on to your target. Another thing is, you keep passing your enemy even when you intentionally slow down, so your target is now targeting you. I'm sure this all part of the game design to make it seem more challenging, but it also just makes it frustrating to play.

This game is in early access and looks and plays better as many 'finished' games.Length of missions is about 20 minutes each so you can jump in your fighter craft even if you haven't got all day.\nDifficulty in casual mode is adequate for newcomers to the genre without being too easy. In normal mode things get a bit too difficult for the casual player although the bullet time implementation helps (TrazerTime™).The not yet available hard difficulty should be a challenge even for experienced gamers.\nThe game is very playable with kb/mouse but of course a joystick seems fitting for such a game. FT:SOC runs smoothly on my PC in highest settings (cinematic mode) without stuttering. So if you are interested in a well made game that is easy to get into this is definitely one to take into consideration.

It's definitely something to watch out for, but it should not stop you from getting this game.","December 22, 2015","true","8.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","3"

However, it's a bit pricy and dissapointingly short. Hopefully the devs will reverse their decision to stop adding to the campaign or maybe add a customizable mission option. I would also love to see scenarios that simultaneously combine air, naval, and ground assault.\n\nAs far as gameplay, I think my major complaint is the enormous amount of health the aircraft have (especially the player's). I would prefer an increase in the difficulty of hitting targets but increase damage. It would be AWESOME if there were damage modelling too.","December 11, 2015","true","5.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kschang77/recommended/365810/","kschang77","kschang77","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kschang77/","993 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nFlying Tigers is a surprising difficult game for such an arcade title, and yes, I'm in rookie mode. It really makes you "earn" your kills, as well as use maneuvers to get away from enemies in dogfights. The game gets frustrating with time-limited objectives and requires some very efficient shooting.\n\nDespite the name sake, you fly far more than just the P40's. You also fly the nearly obsolete Brewster Buffalos, Hawker Hurricanes (as the Brits) as well as the shoulder-wing fixed gear light bombers you see in some screenshots to bomb targets, Twin-engine level bombers, and more. You can fly Japanese planes in the dogfight mode, not in the campaign.\n\nActual flight is done in 3rd person mode, which emphasizes the "arcade" nature of the game. There's even a computed crosshair for you to aim your gun at whatever target you are aiming toward. Your crosshair pulses when your guns are about to overheat (and jam). Ammo is unlimited though.\n\nYou will do ground attacks, in dive bomb, level bomb, torpedo runs (fly LOW!) and strafing. The bombs and torpedoes auto-regenerate after certain segments, which reminds me a lot of the "Air Conflicts" series which also featured missions structured like this.\n\nMy main complaint is the game's surprisingly hard, even in rookie mode. I don't expect to like shoot down all 10 bombers by myself with one-shot kills, but in the first mission alone, defend area against Japanese bombers, I had to retry about 6 times, as I had to kill 4 bombers in limited time. And the guns are not that accurate. You can activate a temporary "Trazertime" (Matrix slo-mo) to get a bit more precise in targeting, but how that's recharged is not explained.\n\nAlso, the game also gives you "rolls" and "loops", but mapped to dangerous buttons (on the gamepad, stick tap, i.e. push) which can be jostled when maneuvering. I remember dying TWICE in the tutorial because I accidentally did a loop at too low a level. Roll helps you get away from a bad guy on your tail, but that rarely happens at least early in the campaign.\n\nThe dogfights in this game are epic, with dozen planes swirling around the sky shooting at each other. Fighters are easy to take down, but not quite so with bombers. And your wingmen will score kills, merely a lot less often than you do. Same with ground attacks.\n\nThere are occasional turret gunner segments where you need to shoot at enemy planes as a tail gunner or turret gunner from a bomber.\n\nSome missions require you to take off (just go full throttle and gear will be retracted when you get airborne). There is at least one mission that require you to land to get a pilot who was forced down by engine trouble, but proper management of speed and gear made that actually quite simple.\n\nThe key to success in this game is proper management of speed and altitude, as in any fighter sim. You don't want to be too close to the target, and not so slow that you fall out of the sky, but if you are too far you'll overheat your gun and not achieve many hits, and you'll take too much flak.\n\nFor example, one of the missions was a night raid on a Japanese convoy, where the level bombers have to take out two transports. By properly lining up against the ships (fly directly over their path) I was able to drop multiple bombs on the ship rather than trying to come at it from the sides and score only one hit at a time, if that at all, which allowed me to take much less flak over all. Rather than having only 10% life left, I had over 80% left with my improved approach, which allowed me to survive the next stage.\n\nEach mission typically has multiple segments, where you jump from one part of the mission to another. One would have the Brewsters Buffalows knock out the searchlights in the convoy, then the level bombers hit the convoy, only to defend itself from a Zero, then the torpedo bombers make a run at the cruiser, scoring several hits, only to run for their lives when Zeros came out to play.\n\nIf you failed one part of the mission you can resume the mission at the prior checkpoint (i.e. repeat just that one part you failed).\n\n\nThe graphics are good, state of the art, and in fact, probably a bit overdone as every plane that goes down seem to end in a huge fireball. Sound is good, though the chatter is a bit inane, as every dead plane seem to result in a "Wilhelm scream".\n\nAll in all, the game covered a part of WW2 that is rarely covered, with state of the arm graphics and turn-and-burn game play. If you are looking for a sim, this game is not it. It is an arcade-flyer for the turn-and-burn crowd. But if you keep that in mind, you will learn quite a bit about WW2 and have a blast.","December 14, 2015","true","3.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

So why should you buy this game instead of playing other Early Access flying sims?\n\nFirst off is the early good signs of polish, even with Early Access, the planes and environment look fantastic and meticulously designed. The bullets and bombs feel like they have destructive impact. When enemy planes are damaged, they show debris falling off and die in spectacular explosions. The polished voice acting will make you feel like you're fighting and flying among the Allies. There are rarely games that take the fight to the Japanese and Flying Tigers helps break the hold on Europe-centric WW2 games.\n\nA handy life bar is present for every enemy, indicating how much you have to do to bring down the enemy. It takes a bit to get used to the controls, but who said piloting and fighting against the Axis was easy? You even get slow-mo to line up your shots and acrobatic moves to evade fire.\n\nIf you're tired of the single player, the other modes, including dogfights, multiplayer, and free flying will give you flight sim goodness. Face off in custom planes against an enemy to practice dogfighting skills.\n\nThe best part, even with all the content for only $9.99, the game is still in Early Access, meaning there's still MUCH more free content to come! More planes are very visibly seen to be coming in the selection screen, so at half price this game is a steal!","March 22","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Surpringly, there are more aircraft than just the P-40, and their are multiple skins you can use for most aircraft (beside bombers and transports) that are quite unique.

It has plenty of singleplayer options and a few multiplayer options to cater to everyone here. Get ready to relive historical air-battles such as the Japanese Christmas-raids on Rangoon in 1941, the Flying Tigers’ first combat over Kunming in China, and the Battle of the Salween Gorge.\n\nPros:Graphics are gorgeous, the models, the enviroment - everything is really beautiful\nPerformance is really smooth, even though the game looks amazing\nSound and Soundtrack are awesome, the game overall sounds great\nVariety of Gamemodes, so you can keep playing after beating the Campaign\nVoice acting is very well done, as already mentioned sounds great\nSteam Integration, everything from Cloud Support to Trading Cards is included\nNeutral:The Multiplayer is sadly almost non-existant.

During the campaign you can learn all the controls and all the basic moves. In campaign you have lots of missions and lots of roles to play so  There are lots of planes to choose from. The story is based on the real one from the World War 2 where China defended against the Japanese forces. Regarding the controls, they are easy to use even if you don't have a controller or a joystick. I played the game using keyboard and mouse I didn't have any problem.\n\nRegarding Graphics, the game looks amazing. The environment + the plane models are beautiful. And also a big plus is that the game runs very smooth on a medium PC, so you don't need a monster pc to run it smooth with 60FPS. That means the game is very well optimized. Maybe when it is raining, it may run a bit slower but something with a very big impact.\n\nThe sound also is very relevant talking about a flying game, the music and also the sound for the planes is very well and it teleports you in the game and overall creates a nice feeling.\n\n\nThe game is challenging and also it has achievement on steam and that's a great thing because you can track your progress easy just by looking on them. I'm very exited to see the new updates on this game and also the final versions!\n","May 21","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Good design of ingame movies and arts.  Gameplay is a nicely done shooter with tricks when you are chased. There are many planes (l really like legendary Spitfire and Seahawk) and developers will add much more.  Its only in early access and I already like it. My opinion – worth buying.","May 15","true","1.4"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

I was impressed immediately by the graphics, very detailed from the landscapes to the characters. You have different options of what you'd like to play, from fighting to just free cruising and you can choose your difficulty. I went with casual and immediately realized the controls were inverted as I blew up into a fiery inferno, so heads up :-). I got the knack of it very easily and found the controls to be smooth. The buttons are simple; click to shoot and toggle mouse to move, so it's simple to pick up and get to playing. The missions have just the right amount of challenge to them; you need to have some skill, but it's not impossible. After completing missions, I found myself cheering out loud, you really get immersed in this world. Overall I am very happy with Flying Tigers, and I look forward to a lot more hours with it.","May 28","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I found this game very addicting, cause it pulls you in and will not let you go. It’s very action-packed game, if you play online (and for me singleplayer is a training before multiplayer) there will be almost no time to relax. Adrenaline, rush, death and anger. I got it all! I like the style of the game. Old realistic planes (different modifications), smell of World War II and like-living characters.\nPros:\n1)	Good balance between realism and arcade\n2)	Planes are adding systematically\n3)	Almost no bugs (or only some minor of them)\n4)	Very nice optimization, I have almost stable 55-60 FPS on my medium computer\n5)	Nice weather and sky effects\nCons:\n1)	For now, I would like to see more planes (but I remember that is only in Early access stage)\n2)	Not so many players online (but I play with friends)\nIn general, I would recommend it, firstly, to anyone who likes planes and age of World War II, secondly, to anyone, who would like to experience something new, after just shooters, RPGs or racing games.\nMy score 9/10 for the game with a big potential.\n","May 27","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Surprisingly, I found it very entertaining to play with friends in the evening. I didn’t know anything about World War II planes, but friends did. As I understood, there are some most famous planes of the World War II with some mods (like Spitfire and P40). That’s interesting to read historical notes about these planes. But what about the game itself? Gameplay is fascinating, I think I wouldn’t like 100% realistic gameplay, the game must entertain first. I still don’t have a joystick, but I’m going to get it soon for a better experience. I think, developers created a very natural atmosphere of 40’s. A little noir colors, voices of the actors, shooting and different weapons. I’m glad there is not only multiplayer, so I can train sometimes and playing campaign.\nGraphics is very polished and optimized, even for my “old buddy”. That surprised me, because is only in early access. I thought, such projects are buggy and unstable, thx to my friends that they persuaded me to play with them.\n","May 27","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Thanks to some presets in the controls, and the "arcade" style controls, handling your mechanical death bird is intuitive and fun.  There's a decently long campaign to be explored, which adds some great context amongst the dogfighting.\n\nThere's also some pretty tough challenges to take on.  These truly test your ability to control your plane and engage in combat seamlessly.  There's also some online multiplayer, and I didn't experience much lag when playing.\n\nAs an icing on this air combat cake, the game looks great.  Even when you drop from "Cinematic" to "High" presets, the game still runs beautifully and looks grand.  The amount of different planes and visual style shows there was a decent amount of passion behind the design.  If anything, Flying Tigers is a great entry point for newcomers who want to shoot stuff out of the sky.  There's a great amount of content to reinforce that initial itch.\n\nI wholly recommend it.","June 2","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I had so much fun with my friends, I drowned in the game. I want to try all planes; I think game play will change a little for every plane. That would be nice to come up with new tactics with my friends. I’m glad Steam has such hard-working developers, cause if every game in early access would improving as fast as this game…well, we would have much more good products. Optimization is wonderful, weather effects, graphics and ping are awesome. Would like to see more players, because you probably will need friends to play comfortable. Anyway, 10/10 in my opinion.","June 2","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You will get matches that feel little one sided, but it can be due to A. Obviously, more experienced players, B. Unlucky C. Chuck Norris.... Run like hell if you get B and C LOL\n\n(Real Review)\nYes what I said about the developers is my opinion. Since it costs a little, you get content for free. Community for the most part is tolerable. Sometimes you get comedians sometimes rude... the usual thing. People help for the most part if you have a question. Overall the ping is stable and so is the game. I like both “allied” planes and Japanese planes. But to me Japanese planes looks a little weird. And I need kamikaze plane!\n","June 2","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The objective system is well thought out and put together nicely, and the planes look like real, very well designed. Grab some friends or play with unknown players. Both modes are fun. This game is totally playable without friends too, but do not expect to find your team in 5 sec. I recommend downloading and trying it out, and if you like it go ahead and have fun as long as you want, the developers deserve it.","June 2","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
