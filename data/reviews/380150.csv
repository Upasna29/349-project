Great atmosphere, interesting story and fine puzzles keep you on your toes, as well as on your way through the ominous Groomlake. Main parts of the story are told via pdas of the mostly deceased personal, which also contain the occasional hint on how to solve the puzzles.\n\nWhile you explore the cruel history of what has happened here, you have also many ways in which you can die quickly and cruelly (the devs also gave you the opportunity to release poor John of his torment and to kill himself in many ways throughout the game). If you die not willingly though, the savepoints are always set very fairly, which is appreciated in this deadly enviroment. So are the puzzles, most of them are logical and "easily" to solve.. if you always keep your eyes and ears open, at least. Beside the hints in the textes, i very much enjoyed reading the excerpts of all the different persons. Also much of the enviroment has textes to describe them furthermore. So, if you don´t like reading, this game maybe is not optimal for you.\n\nGraphically it is well made 2D with great animations. Also the sound and background music enhance the creepy atmosphere greatly. The not too often used conversations of the main char finally, also fit into the positive category.\n\nWhat few gripes i had, would surely be that i dont know of a hotspot key, so i quite easily missed something of importance on the first try, which made it necessary to run around more then i´d like to.\nThere also aren´t that much inventory slots, and the handling needs a bit getting used to, but in the end it fit´s quite well.\n\nConclusio: Stasis surprised me a bit, in the way how quickly the dark, creepy atmosphere sucked me into the game. If you like Dead Space, Alien or Event Horizon like scenarios and enjoy a bloody good atmosphere, you should give this game at least a try. But make sure that you don´t play alone.. in the dark... ;)\n\nPoint Scale 9/10 - Excellent\n\nPlease also check out Completing the Backlog's Curator page\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/completingthebacklog#curation - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","September 7, 2015","true","8.6"," 94 of 100 people (94%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","94","94","100","6","7"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zorder/recommended/380150/","zorder","Zorder","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zorder/","2001 products in account","STASIS is a science fiction horror themed isometric point and click adventure game which takes place aboard the Groomlake, a deep space research vessel that belongs to Cayne Corporation. The game has a very gloomy and dark atmosphere to it and it seems to be inspired by various popular sci-fi horror games and movies such as Alien and Dead Space.\n\nIn STASIS, you take control of John Maracheck, a school teacher which awakes from cryogenic stasis and finds himself on an unknown ship, the Groomlake. Soon enough, John finds that something has gone terribly wrong aboard the ship and he is surrounded by nothing but death, blood and destruction all around him and he is driven by the fear for his family safety.\n\nThe main gameplay element of STASIS, as with any other point and click adventure type of games, is of course, puzzle solving. I can’t remember exactly how many puzzles are in the game but most of them are solvable by finding out certain items and combining them or using them on some background object or something on the environment around you in some way and surprisingly enough, even though I got stuck on some of these sections, afterwards I felt like it all made sense in a way and it wasn’t just some way to stall the player progress. Besides this, you’ll also come across some some other puzzles that involve some actual investigation and sometimes I even had to take notes so I couldn’t forget certain things. That said, STASIS puzzles are not just there for the sake of solving puzzles, they fit in the world and the story and they have a purpose.\n\nFor a indie development team, STASIS features a huge amount of high production quality material such as high fidelity cinematics, amazing writing, some of the best rendered backgrounds I’ve seen in recent years and superb sound design. From these aspects I think the ones that contribute most to the game’s amazing atmosphere are the writing and the overall sound design. The dialogue is voice acted but in this case I don’t feel like it’s that much of a strong point, the voice acting isn’t exactly terrible but it isn’t exactly great either in my opinion. The writing however is really neat, and I don’t mean the character’s dialogue, I’m refering to several crew logs you find scattered throughout the levels and to the grotesque and gruesome descriptions of piles of filth that you come across. These provide with you a backstory and fill you in on the history background of the ship, its crew, the company and what happened in previous years creating a believable and credible game world and timeline. I don’t know how they managed it but the sound is quite a big deal in STASIS, no matter where you are you’re constantly hearing things, sometimes you hear screams, sometimes some child’s creepy chanting, probably product of John’s sanity, or even scratches and noises echoing throughout the ship, in some situations, when John witnesses something rather gruesome you can hear his heavy and constant breathing.\n\nStill, I do have a few gripes with the game such as the lack of resolution and V-Sync options on the options menu. One time I had to change my desktop refresh rate so that the game could progress further, it kept freezing at one section. The options menu only has two options, one for brightness and another one for volume and that is it.\n\nOverall STASIS is a great point and click adventure game, it’s very atmospheric, immersive and the puzzles are challenging. It offers around 10 hours worth of gameplay along with an amazing sountrack by Mark Morgan and by the end of it you might be facing some moral dilemmas.\n\nIf you're looking for good reviews, consider joining Good Games Giveaways & Reviews group.

It took around seven hours to complete.\n\nSo, what this game basically does is pay homage to various movies like Event Horizon, Pandorum, Aliens, and so on (and you will find Easter Eggs in the game demonstrating proof of these influences) while crafting a fairly well written story. It nothing you haven't seen before, but still works quite well within the scope of this game and what it is trying to accomplish.\n\nWhere this game really shines however, is with atmosphere, urgency, and a sense of potential doom at all times. Nothing comes easy for our protagonist. Also, this game doesn't rely on jump scares. It doesn't need to. It draws you in due to the intensity and emotional attachment created almost immediately, You definitely care about the protagonist and his plight. Moreover, you legitimately feel bad for him and are hoping for a positive outcome for all his adversity and perseverance.\n\nFrom a design standpoint, it's definitely a linear experience with maybe one exception. That isnt a bad thing at all. The sense of urgency you feel propels you forward, so the linear design actually works  in the games favor from this standpoint. The audio is fantastic as well, even if some of the basic sounds repeat themselves often. They still really work the help flesh out the setting. Graphically, it's a high end looking isometric game. Of course, it'a also a darker game by design, but it's images are quite evocative.\n\nFinally, what I found quite impressive is that this game proves the validity of the horror genre in an isometric and point and click game. It really does a great job of providing a fresh perspective on the genre.\n\nOverall, there isn't much negative with this game in my opinion except for my biggest peeve with all stories, be they games, movies, or books. Sloppy or poorly thought out endings. This games ending was in part very cool, but mostly, it was underwhelming, which did the game a disservice considering the quality of everything leading up to those final moments.\n\nAll told, I thought this an excellent game that is easily worth your attention. Even if you don't love the horror genre, you might still like this one. 8 genetic alterations to mankind killing their progenitors out of 10.","October 3, 2015","true","12.3"," 57 of 63 people (90%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","90","57","63","4","3"

I am glad to say it did not dissapoint.\n\nThe game will take about 6 hours depending if you read all the PDAs and spend time on the puzzles before looking for hints online. I looked online for hints to 3-4 of the puzzles although in most instances I was on the right lines so they are not too obtuse. Just watch out for diagrams in different rooms, things being stuck to the PDAs and hidden sinks.\n\nThe graphic and sound is very dark and atmospheric, You actually feel like you are trapped alone in a spaceship in deep space. There is very little action and this is more of an adventure/puzzle game but the progression speed makes you feel like you are fighting for your life. The characters you meet are immersive enough with good voice acting. The various objects you pick up and inteact with are well thought out and interesting.\n\nIn terms of re-playability. After finishing the game I went through once more for a couple of hours to hunt the easter egg achievements, and I didn't mind this as you can go through the game quite quick when you know the puzzle solutions and don't read the PDAs.\n\nA great indie game, that was worth paying a but more for based on actual gametime. Although as always look out for it on a sale, as you are likely to only play it through once or twice. Saying that, if I sequel does come out (fingers crossed), a pre-order discount will be good enough for me.","September 6, 2015","true","9.4"," 40 of 41 people (98%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","98","40","41","0","2"

STASIS achieves pretty much everything I love about gaming – fantastic art direction, great visuals, great design, heavy atmosphere and (not always necessary) a very intriguing plot and well written/voiced dialogue. This game has restored a lot of my faith in this industry, great to know minds like this still exist in this industry.\n\nIn STASIS you play the role of John Maracheck, a school teacher whom with his family enter hibernation capsules for deep space travel, after which, John wakes up 3 months later alone on a massive, dark and seemingly abandoned ship but soon finds out that he’s not alone. As John, you will need to progress through the ship, which is achieved by exploring and solving puzzles, in pursuit of your family, not knowing of their current state, and with them try find a way off this ship.\n\nSTASIS is truly a breath of fresh air, if you are a fan of Sanitarium then getting this would be an absolute no brainer, I’m still lost for words that something like this exists in this era, even more so knowing that it was pulled off by a team of two South African brothers, there really is no excuse for gaming to be in the lackluster and uninspired state it currently resides. Easily the best point & click adventure game since the 90’s in my opinion, a true modern classic.","September 2, 2015","true","13.0"," 47 of 55 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","47","55","0","5"

I will give you the reasons why.\n\nPros:\n\n+In my opinion, the game creates a dark and well planned atmosphere, most of the graphics fit in, also the futuristic environment... well done by the devs.\n\n+There are no bugs, and everything is done with voice comments by the participating characters.\n\nCons:\n\n-The game is short. REALLY short. I finished it in less than 6 hours. When i thought about playing it again, i figured out it is a linear story, so... the story is ok, but not THAT good to play it all over again.\n\n-25€ for less than 6 hours? It's a personal decision, but in my opinion, it's not worth the money.\n\n-In this game, you will find a lot of PDAs which tell you some parts of the story, and what happened to some characters in this game. The story is well told, BUT: if i sum up all the time i spent for reading the story in the PDAs (which don't give you any useful information for your progress in the game at all), i guess i can reduce my pure playing time to less than 5 hours.\n\n-Achievements are mostly about how you can die or kill yourself in a game where survival seems to be important. Since the story is linear, i am not going to play it again and try to kill me in every possible way. Doesn't seem fun to me.\n\n-Dialogues can't be skipped, and the game doesn't allow any player input during some of them. Can be annoying if you died just after a dialogue and then have to listen to a crying guy all over again.\n\n-Coming to death: The story is about   mutants on a space ship, they killed the whole crew etc etc... but at no point of the game, you are in danger to get killed by those creatures.  The only way to die is because of your own stupidity (like HEY, there is a closed door with toxic gas behind it... let me open the door! You know what i mean).\n\n-No graphic settings despite gamma and contrast.\n\n-Some of the things you need (this contra is a point of discussion, i know that) are a bit difficult to see, since there is no button to highlight interesting spots. There are some glowing points at some spots, but not all of them. That sometimes results in a search all over the screen to check if you didn't miss something.\n\n-Final summary: This game is just not scary. If you read the cons above, you will figure out that there is like no situation that may scare you, and even jumpscares (if you want to call them like that... snore) are pretty predictable.\n\nMy recommendation: Invest your money into something else. This game is not that bad at all, but around 25€ is way too much for this game.","September 1, 2015","false","5.7"," 186 of 280 people (66%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","66","186","280","3","13"

The screaming stopped a few minutes ago... I'm likely next. I believed in what I was doing, in what WE were doing – I want to make that abundantly clear to whoever finds this. You don't just cure Alzheimer's, diabetes, CANCER, without getting your hands a little dirty. Ethical standards didn't – haven't cure JACK ♥♥♥♥ – but I did; my team did. We make these sacrifices, live with the mistakes, suffer the nightmares... so you can snuggle in your beds at night with your loved ones, blissfully ignorant. You may scoff but the way I see it we're both equally complicit.\n\n"They're breaking through now but I'm not afraid. I'll greet Death with a familiar smile.\n\n"We're old partners, as it were."\n\nSTASIS is an isometric, point n' click, sci-fi horror adventure game. Is it scary? No, not particularly. I was unsettled at points, uncomfortable, grossed out... akin to an experience at Applebee's, but never was I scared. Is it wholly original? Again, not really. It took a lot of fine points from the likes of Dead Space: is there an everyman, missing loved one(s), mad science gone wrong, creepy lullabies, and helpful (but mostly absent) support?\n\nCheck, check, check, check... check! That's a LOT of checks.\n\nIs it good though? Is it fun? That's what's important after all – critical even!\n\nIf you're a fan of this genre I think you'll have a good time with STASIS. Besides a clichéd, predictable story, a few point n' click gameplay pitfalls, and some sporadic, minor graphical glitches it's a pretty fun ride.\n\nYou're one John Maracheckplease, disoriented space schoolteacher everyman aboard the Groomlake, a science research vessel orbiting Neptune doing totally legitimate, above board ethical science stuff. John hasn't the foggiest as to why he's on board, though he likely signed up for the totally legitimate, above board ethical science stuff and just forgot... it happens! John's wife and young daughter are missing and it's up to him to find them. Not an exactly an enviable task, especially when you're on a derelict spook ship.\n\nAs John Maraschino travels from deck to deck he'll talk to a select few survivors (disarmingly pretty science lady, wacky scientist turned God) who guide and impede progress, filling in narrative along the way. John Marrakesh also stumble upon PDAs (future PDAs, suddenly relevant after the mass smart phone extinction of 2049) from the Groomlake's crew, though they unfortunately usually follow the same general story structure: “I love my job,” “This job is kind of shady,” and “Please God forgive me, I have so many regrets about this job.” Despite this I still read each and every email, personal log, and report I could find. They're very believably written and frequently serve to provide different perspectives from other survivor experiences you'll read during John's travels.\n\nThe sound and graphics marry to create an immersive, atmospheric experience. Like I said earlier, STASIS really doesn't have any scares but the environments, denizens, logs, and IMPLICATIONS of what's happening on the Groomlake give it an excellent creepy tone. This gritty sci-fi reality definitely has a storied history, and every component (the science, the tech, the ethical shortcomings) feels real and plausible. You get the sense that things weren't every really great on the Groomlake to begin with, truly the Delta Tau Chi fraternity of space research vessels. Each deck and each individual room is unique, meticulously crafted, and coated from ceiling to floor with different flavors of horror, backed up by spooky horror ambiance.\n\nGameplay is standard point n' click fare: you'll collect various knick knacks and trinkets during each level to solve some thoughtful, clever puzzles to progress. Sometimes the solution is obvious, sometimes you have to hunt for clues (drawings taped to PDAs for example), and sometimes you'll pound cylindrical pegs through square holes,cursing the damnable fools who brought you into this ♥♥♥♥ed up world. For the MOST part STASIS avoids traditional, obtuse point n' click adventure puzzle tropes but boy do they creep in during the mid game (looking at you empty handgun). Still, as someone who doesn't play many of these kinds of games (I prefer Silent Hill pachinko) I managed to beat it in just over nine hours. There are also some fun death fail states that can occur if you screw up a puzzle or put John in a dangerous situation – though these become frustrating real fast when the solution isn't clear.\n\nOverall I enjoyed my time with STASIS, like visiting an old friend. It looks good, it plays well, and it doesn't overstay its welcome. You'll probably get frustrated once or twice but that's the price we pay when we play point n' clicks. It's also unlikely you'll play it again unless you're hunting for achievements so do keep that in mind thrifty readers.\n\nFans of the genre would be remiss to skip this one... fans of sci-fi too.\n\nHow else will you educate yourself on the Eugenics War?","August 31, 2015","true","9.7"," 70 of 95 people (74%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","74","70","95","14","5"

The transposition of the usual sidescrolling camera to a fixed isometric camera has the same general purpose just with another perspective that serves the narrative in a different way. The point and click mechanic, the pixel hunting and the puzzles are just a number of elements that remind me of adventure games of a different time, when this genre was focused on brainteasers and not a story driven cinematic experience (and by cinematic I don’t mean locked at 30fps!!!). But the game doesn’t go out of its way to address nostalgia. The fully voice acted dialogues and the full motion video cut scenes bring the game to a more up to date standard.\nAs a horror game it takes inspiration from movies like Alien or Sunshine and applies the theme of being trapped on a space ship with something dangerous on board extremely well. It builds suspense and mystery through storytelling and the use of gore, sound and the fight for survival without having to fight anything.\nLooking backwards and analyzing the elements of this game, it seems STASIS is at a transitional point between the two predominant styles of adventure games (with a little more focus on the retro style) and this might be the key to satisfy both the old school and the newer fans of the genre.\nThe game has its flaws, but looking at the bigger picture they don’t mean much. STASIS is a five years labor of love from two brothers that poured their hearts and souls into this project (which is a little disturbing considering the game’s theme!) and their debut game is an adventure horror blast.\n\n\nPros:\n+ A gruesome atmosphere for a 2D isometric game\n+ Good sound design and music\n+ A well written story\n+ Intriguing side stories that tie up together\n+ Logical puzzles\n+ Good level design\n+ 8-9 hours of quality gameplay\n\nCons:\n- The graphics seem a little washed up\n- Some pixel hunting\n- The UI bugs at times\n- Only two adjustable settings\n\nRead the full review at:\nhttp://thegameslashers.blogspot.ro/2015/08/stasis-review.html","August 31, 2015","true","14.2"," 32 of 41 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","32","41","0","0"

It's dripping with atmosphere reminiscent of the "Alien" series.  It's surprisingly long.  The soundtrack doesn't seem like much at first, but gradually builds into something amazing all on its own, mainly by respinning a single melody in increasingly different ways until you're hooked.\n\nThe game might feel positively ENORMOUS if you stubbornly refuse to ask for hints.  You can get stuck in quite a few places.  Puzzles are logical once you realize what they actually ARE, but the game is frequently unclear (and occasionally outright misleading) about what your immediate objectives happen to be.  The game is extremely linear though, and shepherds you from one small, self-contained area to the next.  So, all together, this ends up feeling like an adventure game from the golden age of adventure games: incredibly difficult, but not unfair.\n\nIt's worth noting that some of this difficulty comes from the need for pixel-hunting, and not infrequently either.  And, depending on your monitor, you might have to manually wrest control of the brightness level options that the game offers (that really don't get very bright at all) and ramp up the gamma instead.  This does help you see, but damages the game visuals.  The art team did an amazing job with style, but in doing so created a visual scheme that often leaves you feeling like you're lost, blind, and in the dark.\n\nAll in all, it's a great game, dripping with style, and only held back by pacing problems resulting from frequently getting stuck.  Depending on your preferences, all of that might be welcome news.  If not, walkthroughs have sprung up recently to help past the thorny patches.

The level of fear, violence and body-horror the game throws your way also makes for a memorable horror experience in its purest form, one where graphic slaughter is freely paired with psychological horror.\n\nIt's a bit of a shame that the fixed resolution doesn't fully do justice to the great art while getting in the way of puzzles at times: said puzzles can also leave you truly stuck when you meet a couple that feel obtuse or overly vague. When this happens the gameplay can suffer a bit as the story grinds to an halt while you desperately scramble for a solution.\n\nThese few issues can be easily overlooked when you consider the many things STASIS has to offer: it's a good game by itself but also a truly great horror experience that I fully recommend.

Yes, that old school point'n'click masterpiece made me play STASIS.\n\nI'll keep this totally spoiler free. You're John Maracheck and you've just woke up from stasis on an unknown space vessel. You remember that you were put to hibernation alongside your daughter and wife - both of them seem to be missing. Now you need to push onward and find your loved ones.\n\nAs for the gameplay, this is the basic point'n'click game. You gather stuff, combine items and use it on different locations.  As with the other titles of this type, it is a game of trial and error. Beside these, you will also encounter some additional puzzles. Difficulty of these varies. Most puzzles and their solutions are logical, but some are so mind numbing, so better prepare to suffer a crushing defeat and google the walkthrough or bust your head real bad. Great addition in STASIS are death states. You may and will die in the most horrible ways, but you'll also be able to commit suicide and earn Steam achievements. Still, this is no action game and dying is basically triggered by doing something wrong at the right time.\n\nStory is a high point of the game. It deals with different ideas - family, morals and science. PDA's and documents are scattered all around and while they don't have any gameplay significance, not reading these is a HUGE LOSS. Great hints and additional backstory details are revealed this way and they will certainly make you understand main story better.\n\nVisually, STASIS looks and feels like the 90's game. It's the double edged sword. Animations are not really top quality stuff, but everything is highly detailed and if you've been a gamer back then, you're gonna enjoy visual presentation, if not, tough luck - you will probably think game looks ugly (and for what it tries to (re)create, no it doesn't).\n\nSTASIS is rich in ideas and retro-futuristic SF design, which combined with the music by Mark Morgan (Fallout, Wasteland) and others encaptures players in morbid, disturbing world. Voice acting, however, could be way better, but it is bearable.\n\nAfter seven and half hours, the story of STASIS is completed. This is atmospheric, story rich, movie like experience. It is part sci-fi, part body horror that works beautifully and will appeal mostly to old school adventurers who just love great fairy tale and don't mind occasional head splitting puzzles.\n\nGET IT.\n\n***\nIf you like this review, feel free to join me for some more recommendations at http://steamcommunity.com/groups/libereviews","September 24, 2015","true","7.5"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","17","17","0","0"

I literally just heard about it today. The atmoshpere is great, Like a mix between Dead Space and Sanitarium. The mystery of the story has hooked me so far and the voice acting is pretty good. The control feedback is a little meh, (It feels a little slow and unresponsive) but adventure games aren't really known for their tight movement.\n\nOne huge thing - the writing is phenominal. Hovering over items gives you text at the bottom of the screen that narrates your character's thought process. It feels like award-winning novel writing to me at least.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/etopf/recommended/380150/","etopf","centuryon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/etopf/","308 products in account","A Triumph of a one-man Indie success story creating an unabashedly superb Horror Adventure\nHorror games are some of my most favorite, and it is very sad that more have not been made, with most developers and publishers shying away from the genre entirely. It is now up to smaller, more indie, developers to fill in the gap. So it is especially rewarding to have come across this real gem of a game, made by an almost literal one-man army.\n\nI would say this game is almost a love-letter to the Science Fiction Horror genre entirely. The developer himself has admitted fully that this title has major inspiration, and calls out classics from Alien, Event Horizon, Pandorum, Dead Space and Sunshine. It plays upon so many of the known plot points either as homages or subversions.\n\nAs advertised, this game is an Adventure game played from a 2D Isometric perspective using the point and click of your mouse, harkening back to older PC games from the 90's like the oft-mentioned "Sanitarium". You move your character around on screen by pointing and clicking on the 2D backgrounds (double-click to run!) and interact with various environmental props to solve puzzles to in-game progression blockers and allow you to venture onward.\n\nThere is no combat involved in the gameplay. But that said, there are many ways for the player to meet an unfortunate end from both environmental dangers and some of the monstrous horrors, or perhaps the player can even feel John has suffered enough and "put him out of his misery" (or by accident).\n\nThe visuals are well realized and the pre-rendered backgrounds are a gruesome delight. The GroomLake is realized in great detail with such horrific sights to behold. The game starts out with some very disturbing imagery, but it is only the tip of the gory iceberg that awaits the player the further in they go. The only downside is that said pre-rendered backgrounds were rendered at a fixed resolution of 720p and being blown up on a higher res monitor makes them somewhat suffer in quality.\n\nIt is the audio design which really shines through. You'd do a disservice to yourself if you do not put on a good set of headphones to really get immersed in the frightening sounds of the game. The ship is given life by the ambient sounds of machinery whirring, the creaking of the hull, and some of the more disturbing screams and broadcasts over the ships communication system, the announcements of the robotic administrators who are running the ship on auto-pilot are particularly unnerving. The soundtrack by Mark Morgan is effectively haunting and creepy for most of the game and rises to memorable excitement for key scenes. The main characters are voice-acted, and for the most part it is delivered quite well for reach respective character, though John stands out greatly due to the amount of horrible situations he has to react to.\n\nThe narrative story and writing is honestly well done given that it was written by "amateurs". While the overarching plot-line isn't anything special and the main villain is a bit too over-the-top and cliche, the writing that the player comes across in the ship's computers and the PDA's of the crew is very rewarding. Each new journal and e-mail read adds a new piece to the puzzle of the timeline that occurred before John awoke from his Stasis. It is especially fun to read one crew-member's journal about others and then to come across those PDA's and hear the other side of the story. It really adds to the feeling that the in-game world has been "lived in" and that the ship's staff each had their own personalities and roles to play.\n\nThe story really is Horror through and through, it pulls no punches and won't give you much chance to catch your breath with any lulls in the experience. If you're a fan of the Horror genre and Adventure games you owe it to yourself to give this game a shot. It is especially made all the more amazing when you finish with it and realize that again, it was all made by mostly one man over a period of 5 years. A true success story in game development if there ever was one and should be held up as an inspiration for other indie developers out there.","September 5, 2015","true","8.5"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","19","21","2","0"

The details really drive home the fact that something strange happened on the ship and I love how it's done.\n\nThe gameplay is what you would expect. It is a point and click puzzle solving horror game. The puzzles aren't just random either, they feel necessary and really fit in with the way the story progresses. The game throws you right in too, there are no tutorials for how puzzles are solved or any examples of such. But the answers all exist and follow a locgical path. Moving around the environment was easy. I enjoyed the detailed writtings when you hover over pretty much anything in-game.\n\nSound design was very good too. Although at some points it seemed like the sound would get too loud and stay that way and not really feel necessary. For instance just walking down a corridor and the music track seems like I should be in a car chase. Other than that though the atmospheric screeching of whatever and the subtle distance sounds really brought the ship alive. I recommend playing this with headphones.\n\nOne things I'll add about the sound design is the voice acting. Not really the high point of the game. Although some characters including the player character seems alright, the rest of the voice acting wasn't on par.\n\nThe story is all there through PDAs that are left by staff and whatnot. I like that the staff notes feel alive too. They don't just tell you what you need to know but instead have day to day notes that aren't necessary to the story itself, but build this world up and give you insight into a particular persons world. I'm not going to spoil anything so I'll just say play the game yourself and you can decide whether or not you enjoyed the story.\n\nLast thing I'll touch on is the length because most people want to know usually anyway. My steam counter says 7 hours but that was after restarting the game due to playing on a different computer after and not having the save files for some reason. In any case the game is closer to a little over 5 hours I'd say (Depending on your play style). However, the game was a good length overall and it didn't feel like it even should have been any longer. It told the story it had to and did it in a very good way.\n\nFor what its worth, I recommend this game. It is a really cool type of puzzle horror game that we tend to not see that much of. By the end I was left wanting more in anticipation for what the developers will do next.","September 20, 2015","true","8.0"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","0"

It's a triumphant love letter to the classic horror tales of yore, proudly displaying it's inspirations on its sleeve.

I like the pre-rendered look this game got going, it's full of nice detail and at times really beautiful (well, as beautiful as piles of dead, rotting abominations can be). In a way, this feels very close to Planescape Torment to me, thanks to the rather huge player character - in fact, the entire game feels pretty late 90ies, before PC gaming went to ♥♥♥♥ and there was more going on than just FPS and MOBAs. Sound design, even voice acting (considering the small size of the team), is pretty great too.

A lot. If you add some rather graphic and gruesome scenes to the mix, all the better. And STASIS has got that stuff in spades. Everything clicking into place to create a thick, eerie / horrifying atmosphere when stumbling through the dark of a seemingly derelict space craft. All of this is the reason to get the game and the reason I am giving it a thumbs up - half-way through I was invested into the setting / universe (told mostly through PDAs / logfiles) that I wanted to see more... not necessarily play more, though.\n\nUnfortunately, the game itself is rather crappy compared to a lot of point'n'click adventures I played. It suffers mostly from pixel hunting and lack of direction. Whenever I got stuck I was basically missing an item that I did not even recognize as being there in the first place. ♥♥♥♥ got frustrating real quick as I started to scan each screen thoroughly - which didn't quite fit the atmosphere nor the urgency of most scenes.\n\nThen there is the lack of direction, I was kinda lost half the time, because I did not really get what the game wanted me to do or what the actual puzzles/problems were - there is zero hand-holding here, up to the point where I think it could have helped me not getting stuck all the time by telling me what I was looking for. Puzzles are pretty logical and on the easy side, if you happen to carry the proper items around - if you don't, you will be running in circles and backtracking can be a bit of a pain at times (especially if you have to move at half speed due to... reasons). I miss some comfort functions too, like showing all the hotspots or skipping cutscenes (since you will die at times, sitting through the same dialogue takes away from the experience). In a way, the actual gameplay was detrimental to the atmosphere and kicked me out of the immersion several times - because the good stuff got interrupted with me backtracking and not making much progress.\n\nSo, there you have it - good presentation, mediocre to crappy adventure-game - I am sucker for sci-fi/space horror though and as such cannot really hate on STASIS too much, but really - don't get it because you want a great adventure game, it is not. But if DEAD SPACE in a slow point'n'click-style sounds like something you might enjoy, you should have a look or two at STASIS.","September 26, 2015","true","8.0"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

The silence is pierced only by the occasional ghostly laughter or inhuman scream. I freeze, and my eyes dart wildly around the room until it goes away. I hope it goes away. There is so much blood.\n\nSTASIS is about as jolly as you might expect from a developer who cites Alien, Event Horizon and Sunshine as some of his inspirations. The Groomlake is a massive derelict in a decaying low Neptunian orbit, and it really looks and sounds the part. It should've been called the RV McGrimy though, IMHO.\n\nAccording to the dev blog[stasisgame.com], it took 12 hours to implement each scene in STASIS, and every room and object is pre-rendered from detailed 3D models. You won't see much asset reuse - no two rooms or corridors look alike, and there's lots of them. As the ship is all shot up as well as on security lockdown, you don't exactly navigate it the way the architects intended, which adds a lot of variety. There's also elaborate clockwork mechanics for airlocks, tram cars etc, the lighting is beautiful and moody, and the art is undoubtedly a labour of love.\n\nOK enough gushing - I'm a professional. Entering smiley/frowny face mode:\n\n:)\nInteresting backstory, setting and plot. Good mystery, suspense, heavy moments and story pace.\nInteresting themes of morality "for the greater good" in contrast to emotional, or personal morality.\nCreepy aesthetics and atmosphere.\nMacabre horror and occasional jump scares.\nLogical and believable puzzles.\nCutscenes that are fun to watch. It's oldschool. I like it.\nThankfully, there's some occasional black comedy relief in the diaries, for example: "I've never committed murder, not even when we tested that pathogen on those troublesome neighbors. How were we to know they'd choke to death on their own innards? I suppose death was a possibility, but that's science" :)\n:(\nUnskippable cutscenes right after awkward autosave moments.\nSome pixel hunting, not helped by the omission of a hotspot highlighter.\nSubtle, passive puzzle clues mean you may miss essential info. For example, that diagram on the wall 3 screens back, or that sticky note which you thought was purely decorative - I found I had to change my play style from that of most adventure games.\nThin writing in places - not enough reaction from John to significant reveals about his situation or that of his family, diaries are very hit or miss (mostly miss), and the characters are fairly bland; either one or two dimensional.\nLots of reading. Most of of the diaries are optional, but occasionally they contain info required to progress. I see this as a design oversight, as it essentially means you're forced to look at all that extra content, even if you're not curious. The optional diaries should have been marked as such. The placement of the diaries is also sometimes poor in relation to the game's pace - you might get 3 diaries in the same room or encounter one right after you're told to hurry. Again if you knew when they were optional, this wouldn't be an issue.\nVery bleak and potentially depressing plot.\nIn conclusion, this is a great game for the patient - those who like to soak up the atmosphere, explore for clues, find hidden objects and read all the backstory.","September 8, 2015","true","12.8"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","1"

And that's what is important here :p\n\nNothing seems really new or ground breaking.\nThe game mecanics were very close of what I experienced with Deponia (inventory, items to combine and to use on the background or on yourself, puzzles to solve) without silly puzzles and jokes.\nThe story begins with a very standard plot : a father wakes up in an empty ship, not knowing why he's here and is looking for his missing wife and child. Nothing fancy here.\n\nBut I got sucked into the game very quick.\n\nWhy ?\n- The sci-fi background of the game is very well rendered.\n- The horrific storyline behind the main plot is very interresting and delivered bits by bits, while giving hints for puzzles to come.\n- No cheap puzzles, the game will give all the hints you need.\n- No cheap jumpscare but the horrific mood is really good.\n- The musics and sounds are very well crafted and give more to the mood.\n- You can see how most scenes are handcrafted to share different moods : hopelessness, mercy, pain, sadness, disgust, etc... I really loved this point.\n- I really liked the voice acting of the main character. You really feel his pain and his distress. He's no super hero and he's very well written. Sometimes crying, sometimes praying ... Not to much, just little touch, no overacting.\n\n\nYou'll might get a bit annoyed by the compression quality of the backgrounds (it feels really low Oo).\nBut you'll get used to it and you will be sucked by the atmosphere of the game (at least I did ^^).\n\nAlso some walking/running animations are a bit off, and feel like floating on the ground...\nSome animations are not coherent (the guy is hurt to one leg and keep using this one to stand up for example). But it doesn't affect lots of the animations in the game.\n\n25€ seems a bit high for a point & click (IE: no replayability for 6-8hours depending on how good you are on puzzle solving, and if you are a fast reader or not), but the game is still very good and we should encourage those devs to make more quality games ! And STASIS is a quality game for sure.\n\nTL;DR :\n\n- I ended up playing the game in one strech of 8 hours, and I enjoyed it A LOT. A bad game can't do that !\n- Stasis doesn't have all the flaws you can find in a Deponia like game (sorry it's the only game I can compare it to !).\n- The story is really enjoyable and some stuff will make you cringe behind your screen.\n- Maybe a price a bit too high, for 8 hours of gameplay and no replayability. But it will be some good quality 8 hours you'll spend for sure !\n- If you are looking for a good point & click, you'll find it here !\n\nI will for sure play the game a second time to be sure to grasp every bit of story distilled by the game as it's quite interresting and worth the time put into it :)","December 29, 2015","true","11.0"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

There's only a few point-and-click adventure games which I've seen through to their conclusion WITHOUT constant deference to a walkthrough, and Stasis is one of those games.  (Well, okay...a few walkthrough consultations, to be sure, but not THAT many considering, haha!)\n\nA lot of people downright believe that this genre of gaming should have gone the way of the Dodo a long, long time ago.  I mostly agree.  But it's the rare game like Stasis which completely validates the genre's ongoing existence.  STASIS is just modern enough - with its gorgeous graphics, atmospheric sound, excellent voice acting and generally high level of immersion - while still evidencing the kind of story-telling and puzzle-solving logic which surely only the very best point-and-click games, of any era, are able to boast.  It's completely "real-time", you CAN die, and on the whole it's about as "cinematic" as a point-and-click adventure can be without ever fully crossing over into the "action-adventure" stakes.  It's even a tiny bit scary, in its way, but not enough to make it a tie-breaker as to whether or not one should purchase it (i.e. don't buy it expecting Dead Space 1, but likewise don't be discouraged from trying it if you "don't normally like" scary games).\n\nSo who would I recommend this to?  Anyone, anyone at all, who thinks they might be in the market for a high-quality, moderate-difficulty, ultra-atmospheric, surprisingly emotional and, okay, rather "dark" point-and-clicker.  If you don't like reading and/or don't like games where you don't get to shoot loads of things, then please, KINDLY ♥♥♥♥ OFF.  Then again, if you don't like reading things, WHY ARE YOU READING THIS REVIEW?!  So, er...if you managed to get all the way to the end of this review, I guess I'm recommending it to YOU, whoever you are.  It's damned good.  Trust me.  I don't even usually dig this kinda game all that much, and even I think it's staggeringly good.  That's gotta count for something, surely...\n\nVerdict: 9.5/10.\n\n\n(PS I do have to say, however, that the puzzle where you "refine" a body part into a useable blood-and-tissue sample by SMASHING IT TO A PULP WITH AN EMPTY PISTOL was a little on the ludicrous side.  Seriously.  I even thought of using the pistol on the body part before I consulted a walkthrough - since they were the only two items left in my inventory at that point! - and wrote the notion off as kinda ridiculous.  But MOST of the puzzles are still logical enough, hahaha...)","January 19","true","10.0"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

The atmosphere is good and a few jump scares got me real good, but that's only the first hour or two in the game. The rest of the game is just corpses.\n\nI spent more time reading than actual puzzle solving. There are just too many PDAs to read. I'd rather enjoy audio logs than PDAs. Logs uncover what happened in the past and more story, but in the end it doesn't matter. I expected more horrifying truth about the main character. Objects in the game have text on mouse over. I didn't bother to read all of them. I'd like to hear John's personal thoughts on things and items he sees and interacts with. The female voice acting is mediocre.\n\nThe game is a bit buggy. I got stuck many times doing the right thing, but either I was too far away, standing on the other side, or the previous audio cue wasn't finished. There are no clues when you do something wrong.\n\nThe autosave is poor. I had to manually save in every room before interacting with objects. You can die unexpectedly and the game will throw you hours back.\n\nEven with a 50% discount it's too pricey for such a short game.","February 15","false","12.5"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

Fantabulous","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cpt_fantabulous/","668 products in account","(After finsihing the game I have to change my recommendation. The story ended up going in a direction that just left me feeling angry. Everything I wrote below is still true though)\n\nApparently this game was KickStarted, I didn't actually know that from the trailers, since they look very slick, but once I got into the game I started to see the signs of a budget that was a bit too small.\n\nIf you have played games like Sanatarium then you will recognise the kind of horror this game is going for. Even this cutscenes look like they were lifted from a 90's game.  The good news is that the one thing it doesn't lift from the 90's is the puzzle design...on purpose at least.\n\nOne of the biggest problems with this game is that there seems to be critical lines of dialogue either missing or not triggering. A prime example is when you go into a morgue, in the corner there is a large door that the game tells you is a furnace. I will say that one of the things I love is that you only have to mouseover an item to get the description of it instead of having to click on everything. The doors inside the morgue are all iced over and what the game expects you to do is use a ♥♥♥♥ soaked rag you got much earlier in the game. You wrap the rag around the gears that open the furnace and then open it. The gears will jam and start heating the room up. If you stay inside the room at that point you will burn to death but if you run out and then return you will be able to get access to the corpses inside the drawers.\n\nThe problems with the puzzle is that if you interact with the door to the furnace before putting the rag on the gears nothing will happen. Your character will do a fiddling animation and that is. The door doesn't swing open then close again, your character doesn't make a comment. You are given no clue as to what is supposed to happen. I figured out what I was expected to do partly by guessing and partly by blind luck. It was made easier by the fact that the door and gears where the only things I could interact with.\n\nOn top of that I had no idea why I was doing any of this. The game does such a bad job of communicating what is going on a lot of the time. That you end up having to just muck about with the three or four interactable objects in any given set of rooms till a solution presents itself.\n\nAnother problem I have is that sometimes the perspective will screw up. The character model will be huge compared to the objects around them. Sometimes the character will pass in front of parts of the environment that they are clearly supposed to pass under. A group of pipes hanging from  the roof is a good example.\n\nOn top of that there seem to sometimes be sections where the descriptions or line of dialogue where either written or recorded before a area was finalised. This can lead to weird moments like a part early on where you come across the body of a member of the crew. You talk on the radio to another member of the crew about how there friend is dead. The only problem is the corpse is still twitching around on the floor. This also happens with objects in the world, there is a hologram dancer that is said to be dancing to a silent tune. Which would be fine if it weren't for the fact that loud dance music is playing at the time.\n\nI don't know how much of this is glitching and how much is just the result of a tight budget. Even with all these problems I still enjoy the game. It doesn't exactly do anything super new and you will spend a lot of time reading people's PDA's But the writing is really strong, a trio of PDA's you find in a security station really stand out to me.  The voice acting is a bit of a mixed bag as well but there is nothing unforgivably bad and it kinda plays into the Pulp Horror vibe for me.\n\nSo yeah, even though I have some problems with the game I really enjoy it. The puzzles, when I know what they are, are logical and don't employ any moon logic. The game  moves along at a fair clip and the writing is mostly pretty strong. There are some cool ideas hidden in here, particularly when it comes to how some of the people on the ship dealt with the situation.\n\nIf you like point and click adventure games of the old breed then I would give this a look. Even if you don't like those kinds of games I wold still give this game a whirl.","September 9, 2015","false","8.9"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","1"

Most of them are pretty intuitive and, while not being easy, you will probably be able to solve them after a few minutes of thorough thinking. Some others are more difficult and you might not guess the solution so easily (I myself checked the walkthrough a few times throughout the game). But all of them are rather cleverly designed and fit into a sci-fi-like logic.\nThe game spans some 8-12 hours of gameplay depending on how fast you solve the puzzles.\n\nStory:\nBy far its strongest point, the story focuses on a man waking up from stasis on a foreign and apparently abandoned ship. Highly reminiscent of the original Dead Space, but also borrowing ideas from actual recent history and contemporary world, it explores a very dark side of humanity, while also tackling on the meaning of morality in the face of a nightmare.\nThough the voiced characters are rather few (and the acting is great too!), the multitude of notes belonging to several people that you will discover are all unique and each focuses on a different type of personality and on different types of feelings regarding imminent disaster.\nThe over-repetition of the motto throughout the game might seem annoying at times, but it serves to emphasize the motivation of the protagonist in the face of living nightmares.\n\nAtmosphere:\nDark, creepy, desolate and macabre to the point of disgusting, the game manages to create a genuine atmosphere of dread and horror. Turning to emotions at times, it disguises the most inner elements of what it means to be a human behind a curtain of death, danger and utter isolation in space.\nWhile some of the dialogues may not be particularly clever, the notes you will find throughout the game and the environment descriptions are evidence of true artistry in writing and will haunt you with how deep they truly are.\n\nOverall:\nThis is the only game I've rated so far that I would actually give a 10/10 to. Excelent writing, a deep story, original ideas and memorable characters make this a true gem of artistic development.","October 20, 2015","true","10.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

And this narrative - which is uncompromising sci-fi horror - was honestly a treat to experience. It actually manages to pull a deft slight-of-hand by presenting you with two stories in one. The first story is the one that is presented to you through overt gameplay interactions and as a history and series of subsequent events understood (and, frequently, commented on) by your in-game avatar. But this is classic unreliable narration. The reality of the situation, which mirrors the standard narrative in large chunks but diverges on important details, is revealed only to the player via journal excerpts that the in-game avatar seems to overlook.\n\nMy main point of criticism is that the isometric perspective is pulled back too far. As a result, interactive objects are smaller than they need to be and are easily overlooked. When you enter a new room it often isn't clear where your character model is standing. Furthermore you are freqeuntly in areas that feature large blocks of dark, unused space all around the rim of the screen. Why does the player need to see all of this unused space? This isn't a tactical RTS. In fact a more intimate presentation - i.e. closer figures and finer details - would have served the game experience well by not only alleviating the above minor frustrations but also by being a better psychological representation of the claustrophobic circumstances (you are trapped aboard an unknown space ship).\n\nThe game does a great job of sustaining atmosphere throughout, and I think a lot of this has to do with the strength of the story and the writing (esp. dialogue). I'm a writer so I'm used to wincing my way through inane and implausible dialogue. Little wincing was required here except when a rather cookie-cutter villian started issuing canards (you can hear some of these in the video trailer). A few odd intonations aside, the voice acting is fairly solid throughout. It's a point-and-click adventure so, yes, there are a few finicky puzzles. However I resorted to a walkthrough on only two occasions - BOTH times I was stuck because I had missed picking up an object from a previous area (there's that resolution/distance problem).\n\nA 7-8 hour treat for sci fi aficionados who like their fiction hard-edged and very dark.","September 2, 2015","true","10.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The art is fantastic, so is the voice acting. Often you feel the protagonist pain and misery just by the great voice acting. I felt very connected to the protagonist and creeped out by the tense moments you go through, having to do some pretty scary and gruesome stuff.\n\nAlso, the game was developed through 5 years and it seems the developers paid a lot of attention to how the story is given to us, so it is very detailed and careful on the information it gives us. Generally it's well written with a few flawed cliche/stereotypical characters, such as the magalomaniacal scientist playing God, but we can get past that and enjoy the overall experience.\n\nAlso, we might expect a sequel, which is very exciting. So if Stasis is a success we might have an even better second game?

It isn't necessary a 'survival' horror, per se, but there are a healthy amount of intriguing ways to die, for certain. I would go a bit more into detail about this, but I feel like you should learn for yourself what all that entails :D\n\nGraphically speaking the game is stellar. The developers tug at the nostalgia strings and bring back the pre-rendered 2D landscapes of older games with a contemporary twist. If you look at some of their devblogs and videos, they even explain a lot of the current technology they use to provide an unparalleled atmosphere for the point-and-click genre that you honestly just do not see anymore.\n\nGameplay is simple, but in depth. It focuses almost exclusively on puzzle solving and some of the puzzles are delightfully subtle. One word of advice I can give is DO NOT GLOSS OVER THE PDAs. The PDAs and your own logic are your most valuable tools for solving the puzzles. Although there was one or two instances within the progression of the story where the puzzles didn't make much sense (there's one part where, if you think on it, the puzzles in question were wholly unnecessary to move the story along) the greater majority of them are engaging, interactive, and fulfilling.\n\nSound is fantastic. I can't put it any other way for an isometric game. The music is especially fitting and not overly obnoxious or obtuse. The sound effects themselves are perfect, with occasional sounds that will make you stop what you're doing to investigate and make sure you're not about to be attacked. One delightful addition is the aspect of proximity, in which sound escalates in volume as you near its source. Don't see that too often with these sort of games, really.\n\nThe story itself goes back to oldstyle Silent-Hill-esque horror with a long, healthy lead up before you actually encounter anything particularly violent. Which is especially good, considering that a lot of horror games thrust the horror aspects directly on you with the expectation that you won't consider it an action flick. Dead Space makes a huge spectacle of their horror elements within the first five minutes, but Stasis takes its time. The developers of Stasis know that horror must only come with an element of mystery, because the imagination is more terrifying than anything a writer can provide.\n\nAnd trust me, you -WILL- second guess yourself on a few things ^_-\n\nMy only complaint is that there is not much replay value to the game. The game seemed ripe for a choice system or some greater degree of urgency in the form of puzzle failures being something more than just an annoyance or inconvenience. I understand that the storyline and narrative demands a certain amount of scripting, but the game itself seemed perfect for a little less rail-roading and a bit more involvement on the player's end.\n\nONE LAST THING:\nThe guys who made this are -incredible- in their dedication to customer satisfaction. I had a few issues with the game during my play and had a response to a support ticket with a resolution in the span of an hour. Good luck getting that from a AAA developer!","May 19","true","7.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It all looks a little dated, some of the animations are a bit awkward & unnatural and it all looks a little rough around the edges.  But something doesn't have to be pretty to be beautiful. And not to mention this game is just dripping with atmosphere.\n\nFrom the meticulous created environments to the haunting screams that echo throughout The Groomlake's vast hulking shell the world Chris Bischoff throws you into is both terrifying and captivating. I would quite happily spend hours exploring these corridors over and over again, admiring all the tiny details hidden amongst the blood drenched bulkheads. But that may just be because I am terrified to discover what horrific creature awaits me around the next corner.\n\nAnd like any good point 'n' click the puzzles in STASIS tread the fine line between logical and fiendish. Creativity and patience are rewarded (don't forget to read all those personal logs) whereas carelessness will inevitably end in failure and the occassional amusing death.\n\nIt may not be pretty but there is a definite haunting beauty to this game and I highly recommend any point & click aficionado or horror game fan give Stasis try.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtZOYvYrGL4","August 31, 2015","true","6.6"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

You know where the plot will lead 30 minutes in, but the game is mostly interested in showing you a lot of dead bodies on the way.\n\nUgly environments. The art style reminds me of Sanitarium (1998) but that game had a lot of different areas to render, here you just have multiple rooms in a grimy spaceship. Some of the screens try to have vertical depth but end up looking borderline undecipherable.\n\nLog entries redundantly explain the events that happened in each area two or three times. Then, after you've read the logs, the voiced characters will have a discussion where they reach a conclusion without acknowledging that you already understand what's going on from those entries.\n\nA couple of the most illogical puzzles I can recall in an adventure game. Some of these puzzles only seem possible to figure out because you have a very limited amount of items and a very limited amount of rooms to try them in. Even then, it's frustrating to try out several near-solutions and get no feedback from the protagonist other than misleading default actions ("I could do that, but it would break...").\n\nA lot of the puzzles seem like the answer was determined then mapped to whatever random objects they felt like giving the player that had the slightest chance of achieving that end.\n\nThe player needs to get down a deep hole, I guess a bedsheet will suffice!\n\nYou need to mash up some body parts: why bother letting the player find any more suitable object when they can use  that pistol they picked up an hour ago?\n\nSome amber from this tree will be really useful. We could allow the player to scavenge any of the computer parts around for something sharp, but why not just force them to attack this murderous bug queen and steal its pincer instead? We can even make it a puzzle by having it ruthlessly devour the player unless their attempt falls within a 3-second "dazed" window!\n\nI want the player to forge a key for a lock. I guess I'll give them some "bone mending glue"?? which obviously works well enough to cast a molded shape, which they can then somehow attach it to a twisted piece of metal afterwards. No feedback from the protragonist if you try the lock using either of these pieces by themselves.\n\nIf you tried Stasis and you love it, I won't begrudge you that. But I think this is a dour, arbitrary exercise and you could spend your time better.","October 31, 2015","false","6.9"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","1"

It's a fairly meaty, beautifully pre-rendered isometric horror adventure game set on a deep space research ship called the Groom Lake, one that has taken advantage of the remote and isolated nature of deep space in order to evade ethical and legal restrictions on the types of biological research they're doing. It's not a completely original scenario, of course. There are plenty of horror games set on some sort of ship or space station that has gone horribly wrong and killed off its inhabitants. But if it's a well-worn trope, it's a well-worn trope for a reason: it resonates strongly, and STASIS is no exception to that. It does add a couple of layers to the horror that I haven't seen elsewhere, though: protagonist John Marachek and his family weren't inhabitants of the ship, nor did they intend to go there as part of some investigation or rescue mission. No, they were in the titular stasis on a family trip, and the Groom Lake abducted them for use as experimental subjects. John didn't bear the brunt of this, although being summarily ejected from stasis hasn't done him any medical favors, but he's got no guarantee the same can be said for his loved ones.\n\nSo you have an immediate and compelling goal: find your family, and get the hell off this ship before it's too late. And since John is a completely unequipped civilian contending with a ship that's been the death of everyone aboard, that is going to take some doing. Fortunately, John is resourceful and dogged in his determination, and before long he has communications, at least, with a lone other survivor to help guide his quest. Unfortunately, the Groom Lake is a really, really terrible place, falling apart where it's not actively trying to murder John, and the methods required to progress are frequently pretty stomach churning. There's a healthy amount of body horror and other visceral unpleasantness, and it should say something about the tone that one class of achievement is for discovering the game's easter eggs: which inventory items you can use to have John end his existence prematurely. But not easily. Yeah. It's pretty freaking bleak.\n\nBut how is it as a game? Well, I do wish that the resolution were higher. The game's backgrounds are all prerendered (and, as I say, gorgeous - the quality of the screenshots were my initial hook into the game), so it's understandable that that limits resolution options, but it's a little weird that 720p was the one resolution chosen. I'm pretty sure most people can do better by now. Oh well. I also wish that you could skip through dialogue. Not because I'm one of the heathens who skip that stuff first time out, because the story was absolutely one of the things I came to STASIS for. But because this is a game where you can die, and while most of the time it's something you yourself initiate (often by doing something obviously stupid) and pops you back maybe a screen or so, there are a handful of instances where it comes right after a lengthy dialogue exchange without a chance to save. Beyond that, it's a very solid adventure game. Puzzles are generally quite fair and mostly logical as long as you've noticed everything you can interact with and found all your inventory options (although I had to resort to hints multiple times since there were several instances where I didn't). As I said above, some of the solutions are quite grotesque, but they evolve naturally out of the situation and the very limited resources without any weird leaps of logic like in many classic adventure games. You can die, but it's because you missed some important step in whatever you're trying to do most of the time, with only a couple sequences having any relation to your timing or reflexes. There are plenty of logs and things to look at to set atmosphere, and some really fantastic sound design. And all told, it took me around 9-ish hours to complete and then snag the last few achievements I missed. Quite fair for the price, I'd say.\n\nSo do I recommend STASIS? Absolutely, as long as you like your horror bleak and unrelenting.","September 12, 2015","true","8.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It is great, but if you know some films and games you can predict the end (or parts of it) very easily.\n\nBut I think the strength of the game is more the way it tells you everything.\nThe Devs totally understood what environmental storytelling means. The locations are very great put together and it feels creepy and nasty and you totally don't want to be on this ship.\nThat's just a great horror atmosphere. I really loved it.\n\nIt is a Point & Click adventure, but you will also explore a lot. So for me it felt more like a mix of exploration and adventure, which is great, cause there are many things and areas to explore.\n\nAnd there is also much text to read. Some find this terrible, but I enjoyed reading them all. Everyone had its own style and sounded as if it were written by different persons. You slowly discover what happened to everyone and why you seem to be all allone on the ship.\nAlso the hover texts are very well written and support the atmosphere.\n\nThe puzzles are mostly item based. So here you have the typical Point & Click style. You pick up items and either combine them or use them with your environment.\nThey aren't allways easy, but, what I liked very much is, that they are mostly very logic. It's not like in other adventures, where you do absolutely strange things to proceed. Instead you often find yourself thinking: "Ok, I would do this so and so." And it really works like that!\n\nAnd last, but not least.\nThe speaker are very good. They scream, they cry, they yell. And it sounds very natural most of the time.\nNot many speaker manage to sound this way. Also the voices do match the atmosphere very well.\n\ntl;dr\n\nPros:- cool prerendered isometric graphics\n- very creepy atmosphere\n- the few music tracks in the game are great\n- has some sort of exploration\n- very well written texts\n- puzzles are (most of the time) very logic\n- great speaker\n\nCons:- the story is very good, but also has many clichés and is sometimes very predictable.\n- while the puzzles are mostly very logic, there are some ( very rare ) spots in the game where you really don't know what to do.\n\nNeutral:- Most of the time your only goal is to get to the next room.\n\nconclusionI payed the full price and it was totally worth it!\nIf you love a creepy and great atmosphere more than plain shockers...\nIf you love to explore and to solve puzzles...\nIf you are looking for a great Sci-Fi-Horror experience...\n... you'll love STASIS.","October 30, 2015","true","11.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

It's a fairly meaty, beautifully pre-rendered isometric horror adventure game set on a deep space research ship called the Groom Lake, one that has taken advantage of the remote and isolated nature of deep space in order to evade ethical and legal restrictions on the types of biological research they're doing. It's not a completely original scenario, of course. There are plenty of horror games set on some sort of ship or space station that has gone horribly wrong and killed off its inhabitants. But if it's a well-worn trope, it's a well-worn trope for a reason: it resonates strongly, and STASIS is no exception to that. It does add a couple of layers to the horror that I haven't seen elsewhere, though: protagonist John Marachek and his family weren't inhabitants of the ship, nor did they intend to go there as part of some investigation or rescue mission. No, they were in the titular stasis on a family trip, and the Groom Lake abducted them for use as experimental subjects. John didn't bear the brunt of this, although being summarily ejected from stasis hasn't done him any medical favors, but he's got no guarantee the same can be said for his loved ones.\n\nSo you have an immediate and compelling goal: find your family, and get the hell off this ship before it's too late. And since John is a completely unequipped civilian contending with a ship that's been the death of everyone aboard, that is going to take some doing. Fortunately, John is resourceful and dogged in his determination, and before long he has communications, at least, with a lone other survivor to help guide his quest. Unfortunately, the Groom Lake is a really, really terrible place, falling apart where it's not actively trying to murder John, and the methods required to progress are frequently pretty stomach churning. There's a healthy amount of body horror and other visceral unpleasantness, and it should say something about the tone that one class of achievement is for discovering the game's easter eggs: which inventory items you can use to have John end his existence prematurely. But not easily. Yeah. It's pretty freaking bleak.\n\nBut how is it as a game? Well, I do wish that the resolution were higher. The game's backgrounds are all prerendered (and, as I say, gorgeous - the quality of the screenshots were my initial hook into the game), so it's understandable that that limits resolution options, but it's a little weird that 720p was the one resolution chosen. I'm pretty sure most people can do better by now. Oh well. I also wish that you could skip through dialogue. Not because I'm one of the heathens who skip that stuff first time out, because the story was absolutely one of the things I came to STASIS for. But because this is a game where you can die, and while most of the time it's something you yourself initiate (often by doing something obviously stupid) and pops you back maybe a screen or so, there are a handful of instances where it comes right after a lengthy dialogue exchange without a chance to save. Beyond that, it's a very solid adventure game. Puzzles are generally quite fair and mostly logical as long as you've noticed everything you can interact with and found all your inventory options (although I had to resort to hints multiple times since there were several instances where I didn't). As I said above, some of the solutions are quite grotesque, but they evolve naturally out of the situation and the very limited resources without any weird leaps of logic like in many classic adventure games. You can die, but it's because you missed some important step in whatever you're trying to do most of the time, with only a couple sequences having any relation to your timing or reflexes. There are plenty of logs and things to look at to set atmosphere, and some really fantastic sound design. And all told, it took me around 9-ish hours to complete and then snag the last few achievements I missed. Quite fair for the price, I'd say.\n\nSo do I recommend STASIS? Absolutely, as long as you like your horror bleak and unrelenting.","September 12, 2015","true","8.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Side-stories can be found in reading variouse PDA's / E-mails / Computers\n+/- Its linear. There are no alternative endings\n-Its somewhat short. I completed it in 10 hours.\n-Some of the puzzle areas seems harder then they really are due to poor hints / item placement\n-Price is kinda high, although, the game is well done.\n\nHonestly, its a really good sci-fi horror game with a great story to tell. You will probably cry or come close at one point in time if your a human, and you become attached to the characters. You defiantly must READ EVERYTHING you find in this game. A huge part of the game is told through PDA's and E-mails.

I can live without the jump scares and the frequently limited perspectives most games in the genre restrict you to.  I thought Stasis would give me an opportunity to test the waters, so to speak, and visually speaking, the game delivers quite a bit of quality.\n\nUnfortunately, where it falls flat is in an overly convoluted backstory that you have to piece together from scattered crew logs.  Further, I never once felt anything for the main protagonist.  His personality was inconsistent -- tossing his cookies over a pile of bodies, collapsing into a weeping heap over someone he has to put out of their misery after having accidentally killed someone else probably only an hour before hand, watching perhaps the most horrific event he could and then telling his companion to get a grip a few minutes later.\n\nEven after finishing the game, I'm still completely at a loss as to what happened on the Groomlake before my character woke up other than a perfect storm of events that would give Agent Mulder nightmares.  The end game is one mindf*** after another with an overall depressing conclusion that left me wondering why I had bothered in the first place.

The game draws obvious heavy inspiration from classic sci-fi, from Alien, to System Shock. The developers did their homework when it came to building a creepy and mysterious atmosphere. One thing I have noticed though is that Stasis isn't really all that scary. Creepy? Sure. Atmospheric? Definitely. Just not scary. The setting and story are the only real selling points here, but that isn't a bad thing because Stasis does both pretty well. The gameplay itself is rather standard of the point and click genre,  combining items, finding where and how to use items, puzzles etc. No surprises to speak of really but I will say there is no hand holding either, you've got to pay attention and be clever. I got stuck more then once and sometimes puzzles were vague and obscure at times, however these moments are rare though. What kept me playing Stasis was how the game feels almost like a movie mixed with a game. There are cut scenes and story moments that really do an awesome job of building the universe. I wanted to know more and it gave me just enough to chase the carrot. The voice acting is solid and helps build the tension. John's reactions to things make you feel like you're there. The graphics are spectacular for a P&C game, as are the music, and sound effects. They need to be for what they aim to do with this game. In all the journey of Stasis is incredibly well done and fun. The story itself has some standard tropes that I hope have a twist. I can't comment on this until I complete the game. Which should be fun and soon!\n\nI made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!\nhttps://youtu.be/7y6A5ZTkLIk\nI hope you enjoy!\nMartyr","August 31, 2015","true","2.4"," 12 of 21 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","12","21","0","0"

The atmosphere mostly reminds of me Dead space and any number of SciFy movies, which means for me - it's great. The game itself does a good job of reminding you of old adventures, with little hand holding as possible, while still having logical puzzles, and offering you plenty places to die.\n\nThe story itself is deeply disturbing, with a unlucky guy waking up in the wrong place, at the wrong time. It is well worth investing your time, reading every PDA in the game just to get a feeling of what happened.\n\nThe only story issue I see (mind you, it's a minor issue) that game has a number of SciFy tropes in it, but hey - in space, nobody can hear you scream. :)\n\nWhile good game and great adventure, the biggest issue (which I feel is going to be a turn off for many) is the price tag. In recent years, we've seen the explosion of indy games and prices have gone up. Paying 25 euros (or less now, while its on sale) is way too much for this, especially if you compare it to some other adventure games, which cost less and offer more (TellTale being the prime example, Deponia series as well, or if you want older games, Monkey island 1/2 and Grim Fandango)","December 27, 2015","true","14.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

As a horror game its hits on all the right notes, rather then focusing on jump scares which loose their value at an exponential rate and wouldn't really work for an isometric game, stasis rather focuses on the ever constant mood. The set pieces are what they are, bloody, goory, and just out of your vidision to get a complete picture of exactly you are looking at. As you might imagine, this lack of view is actually a boon to the game as it allows the player to fill in far more horrific items they may dream up to fill the holes. While you may have no problem sleeping, playing the game you will force yourself to consider ethics and morality not within the confines of the game (there is no choice) but your own as you explore this "S.S Horror Ship".\n\nAs an adventure game it manages to miss nearly every pitfall many recent point and click adventure games run into, game logic. Stasis, when it comes to puzzles are firmely placed in real world logic, meaning the puzzles are based off of knowledge you already posses, rather then say a game like Deponia(which I still enjoy), where the puzzles are over the top and becomes a exercise and understanding the game logic then finding the puzzles. Being from a Isometric standpoint there is a few very scarce issues of not being able to see what you need to see or interact with due to the darkness of the object or how it looks relation to everything else, but as i said, these are scarce.\n\nStasis has but one flaw and that is its menu system can be clunky or annoying to work through. The game menu is "chunky" for lack of a better term and hates to remember your volume settings. In addition some puzzles that have a menu system lack a certain responsiveness making it confusing occasionally what you are suppose to be doing.\n\nStasis manages to pull off what I consider the best kind of horror that a horror game can provide, forcing the player to look inward as they progress through the situations presented to them through the game that they have no hope of fixing, only moving past.","September 12, 2015","true","9.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Describing it as a "point and click adventure" doesn't do it justice; it's a finely crafted piece of entertainment, conveyed through extremely detailed isometric graphics and animation, and atmospheric sound and music. It's a very unsettling game, and it pulls no punches when it comes to being bleak, particularly in its uncompromising third act. The storyline initially appears simple, relying on established and well-worn sci-fi horror tropes, but it goes in a far more interesting direction that it first appears, and the closing moments of the game will have you reassessing what you thought you knew about the story.\n\nThere are some flaws; the voice acting for the main character is of a high standard (he really goes for broke in the third act), but the supporting characters are weaker, although for a low budget indie game it's surprisingly good. The "Alien / Aliens" references are a bit much; I love a good homage, but they're everywhere, the game doesn't need to fall back on such references. A couple of the puzzles are a bit of a stretch, not necessarily in knowing what to do, but figuring out how to do it. The puzzles are mostly of a high standard though, and the game moves from one section to another with a limited number of rooms and objects so that figuring out solutions isn't too daunting. It took me a little over 11 hours to beat the game, and that's with reading all the PDA entries (which are highly recommended if you want to see how deep the story goes).\n\nOverall highly recommended if you like sci-fi horror, point and click adventures, or just a damn good game.","September 13, 2015","true","11.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It sets out its goal and it achieves it.\n\nThe puzzles are almost all good and clear, with a nice mixture of challenge.  I really appreciated the environmental clues for the statis tube puzzle in particular.  I only found two puzzles I felt were kind of unfair -- the puzzle to get the key to the battery compartments in Project SEED, which is pretty much "use everything on everything until it's solved" and the puzzle for getting the tree sap in hydroponics, which is a timing puzzle based on doing something that is obviously a terrible idea and not obviously a timing puzzle, so when you do the obviously stupid thing out of frustration and an inability to figure out what to do next, you'll probably die instead of getting the next piece of the puzzle anyway; needlessly making the puzzle seem impossible.  Another little hint in the form of emails or diary entries would have take care of either of those puzzles.  The ending is beautiful and perfect, a terrific payoff for the entire game.  It's not a surprise by any means -- I wasn't surprised by any of the elements of the ending, which features a couple twists and turns -- but it's really not about being surprised.  It ends the way it should end, the way it must end.  It ends RIGHT.\n\nSTASIS is very much a horror game.  It is NOT a "scary" game.  There are technically jump scares, but I missed about half of them because I often wasn't staring directly at the protagonist the whole time; I was looking around the screen for items to interact with, and I occasionally only knew there was a jump scare because of the music swell.  It's not a very scary game at all from the context of startling you or making you worried that something might kill you at any moment (as an adventure game, that's true, but only if by "something" you mean "the player's choice in what to click on").  But it is absolutely a horror game.  A deliberately paced mounting sense of horror and realization confronts both the player and the protagonist.  There are a couple twists that leave you wondering what, in this space-borne house of horrors, the real "monster" is for a satisfying amount of time.  The actual reveal of the monsters is almost a bit of a let down; considering the abqttoir you've been through at that point to get to them.  But if that seems disappointing, you can always remember where they came from, and the horror of that will keep your stomach turning.  It's kind of a classic, near cliched, story for the genre, but it's beautifully realized and masterfully told.\n\nIf you want a horror adventure game, where you're left almost psychologically ill by the end, and you're not going to just turn a corner and jump out of your skin, STASIS is an awesome choice.  I backed the game on Kickstarter and there are no regrets.  A great game.","September 22, 2015","true","7.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The atmosphere mostly reminds of me Dead space and any number of SciFy movies, which means for me - it's great. The game itself does a good job of reminding you of old adventures, with little hand holding as possible, while still having logical puzzles, and offering you plenty places to die.\n\nThe story itself is deeply disturbing, with a unlucky guy waking up in the wrong place, at the wrong time. It is well worth investing your time, reading every PDA in the game just to get a feeling of what happened.\n\nThe only story issue I see (mind you, it's a minor issue) that game has a number of SciFy tropes in it, but hey - in space, nobody can hear you scream. :)\n\nWhile good game and great adventure, the biggest issue (which I feel is going to be a turn off for many) is the price tag. In recent years, we've seen the explosion of indy games and prices have gone up. Paying 25 euros (or less now, while its on sale) is way too much for this, especially if you compare it to some other adventure games, which cost less and offer more (TellTale being the prime example, Deponia series as well, or if you want older games, Monkey island 1/2 and Grim Fandango)","December 27, 2015","true","14.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There is a tremendous amount of detail put into this game. Almost every piece of each part of the levels has a unique description, describing even the way a shadow cast by a slow spinning fan makes your character believe he's seeing things move in his peripheral vision. The pdas you stumble across flesh out a large deal of the story. Each one belongs to a unique npc, and is filled with backstory ranging from why he got on the ship, whom she’s in love with, to how they are coping with the dubious experiments taking place. It's all the best things about an interactive story, and neither the puzzles, nor the horror overtones, go out of their way to interfere with your progress through it.

I was interested in Stasis more for the sci-fi horror aspect.  And in that respect Stasis really delivered.  I loved the gritty atmosphere of the Groomlake and the horrific vision of genetic research gone bad.  The PDAs and computer entries throughout the game added some great depth to the story.  The different backgrounds of the (dead) characters you come across successfully brought the setting on board the Groomlake to life.  Their individual stories were often more interesting than the the main story itself.  The main story is somewhat cliched (man out to save his family from science run amok), but I thought it was reasonably well done.\n\nI spent about 11 hrs completing the game.  I thought the puzzles were on the difficult side.  Puzzles ranged from finding very well hidden objects, to pattern matching, to straightforward reasoning, to ... yeah, a few of the solutions felt a bit arbitrary.  I got stumped three times and had to resort to google to find answers.  One puzzle in particular (the hardest in the game, I would guess) had enough misdirection I was hopelessly off the rails in finding the solution.  Fortunately the dev had posted the solution on the Steam forums and I was able to continue on with the game.  But, be careful resorting to Steam forums for clues.  My last trip to the forums revealed clues for puzzles a bit beyond the point in the game where I was having trouble, and so one puzzle was spoiled for me.  There's a nice linear walkthrough pinned on the forums though; I should have used that instead.\n\nFor the ~$19 I paid I thought overall Stasis was good for what it is and I mostly enjoyed playing it.  However, playing Stasis also reminded me why I don't play point and click adventures very often.  I would definitely recommend this for fans of the point-and-click genre.  For those who don't play these sorts of games regularly, Stasis has a wonderful sci-fi horror setting and solutions to the puzzles are out on the internet if you need them.\n\nThe situations your character finds himself in are often quite deadly.  Yes, that means I died more than a few times.  Most of those deaths result in Steam achievements.

Thumbs up.\n\nLong mode: Thumbs up but read on...make sure you know what you're getting. Below are answers to the questions that most people have.\n\n1. Nice atmosphere to the game. Very, very similar to the old Sanitarium...which is a great thing.\n2. Decent voice acting.\n3. Some really interesting and frankly wonderfully disgusting areas.\n4. Some good jump scares and a wonderful sense of mystery.\n5. One emotional scene that can cause people to lose sleep depending on their domestic life.\n\nSo overall I'd give it a thumbs up. But there are two massive 800 pound gorillas in the room with this one.\n\n6. It's a damn pixel hunt. I don't mind trying to figure out puzzles. I do mind having to mouseover the entire screen every time I walk into a room and hope that I stumble upon the right pixel to grab an item. This kind of game design seems a bit outdated.\n7.  I don't get the ending. At all. It's ambiguous, unsatisfactory and frankly uninteresting. Without closure the ending costs it all-time great status like Sanitarium.\n8. 4 hours. Yep, that's what it took. 4 hours to play through the entire thing. Don't let anyone fool you and tell you this is a 10-15 hour game. It's not. I got it for $5. It was worth that price. But had I paid $15 I'd have been ticked off because of the length. So if you're a fast reader be aware that you're play time is going to be fairly limited.","December 26, 2015","true","4.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Although you may encounter the weird animation here and there, since John will be interacting with stuff which makes it look weird, I have to say that the game's graphics are really good, plus the small amount of custcenes are done really well\n\nThe music and sound effects are really good too and made me uneasy and scared if one of the creatures would jump out at me. The voice acting is okay, it's not the best but gets the job done\n\nThe game's difficulty is not that hard. It's a puzzle adventure game where you have to find things in the environment and interact it with other things, I did get lost in some areas and had to rely on a walkthrough but overall the game is not hard\n\nOverall, STASIS is a really good horror game. I encountered no glitches, except for one which is known as the out of bounds glitch, which basically means you glitch out of the world and cannot interact, thankfully the guys at The Brotherhood were kind enough to provide me with a save file from where I left off, thanks guys!\n\nThe developers are very active with the community and help out in anyway they can!\n\nSTASIS as a whole is a fun horror game for those people who love horror but don't want a jumpscare galore and I cannot wait for the next game from The Brotherhood!\n\nRECOMMENDED :)  THEPCGAMER'S BEST GAME IN STEAM LIBRARY! (What's this? :- Like some games get "Best Game of 2014" or "Best Indie Game", etc... So I have decided to make my own!)","May 17","true","5.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

If you want to read my review click "Read More"\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEbKq-R6ZN0\n\nSTASIS feels like a AAA 90's computer game. The animation and visuals of the human models have a distinct 90's quality to them. It's not a bad thing at all, but for some reason the nostalgia center of my brain is going nuts while playing this game, even though it's brand new to me.\n\nIt also plays like early PnC adventure games. There is no hand-holding. There isn't a pop-up telling you what you need to do if you get lost. There are some modern twists like not having to switch your 'verb' as that is done automatically whilst also changing the icon to reflect the action, such as an eye-ball to see and having the text automatically appear. There is also PnC 'logic' which is kind-of whitewashed via the computer logs that you read, but still, some of the puzzles when thinking about it from a larger perspective don't make much sense. Why would a spaceship be fraught with so many bugs?\n\nThere are also some Myst-style sections/puzzles intertwined as well. Close-ups of panels that need to be operated. Nothing that is as hard as Myst-type puzzles, but some of the order-of-operations style puzzles that Myst seemed to have burned into my brain are present.\n\nThe atmosphere is executed very well. The isometric (Sidenote - I love isometric games) viewpoint is not only easy-on-the-eyes from a visual standpoint but facilitates the horror themes of the game. A fixed perspective with enough of an angle to foreshadow events is a great way to heighten suspense.\n\nSTASIS feels like a hidden gem from the past.\n\nRecommended.","August 31, 2015","true","5.2"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

Yes the graphics are not high resolution, but I got used to them after about ten minutes or so.  But graphics aren't everything, this game oozes with atmoshpere!  Definately play with headphones on at night, it seriously freaked me out!  Never in a million years would I think an isometric adventure game could scare me, but the ambiance and sound is abslolutely fantastic and I actually had to stop playing because I was so freaked out one night.  Not because of the jump scares, but as the story unfolds, you will start to use your imagination as to what happened on the Groomlake and it's VERY disturbing to think about it.  The antagonist is a little cliche and silly, but it doesn't ruin the experience, the rest o f the game is fantastic and the ending will seriously make you think and wonder what it means.  Well done Chris, I backed this game during the Kickstarter and I don't regret it one bit.  Hopefully Chris will create some DLC or Stasis 2 so we can continue the story as it does end on a bit of a cliffhanger.

Stasis is a inventory puzzle based adventure game that tells its story primarily through atmosphere and diary entries with a focus on body horror and gore. It owes a lot of its storytelling to 90's PC games, and I was really shocked to see this sort of uncompromising game released in 2015. The narrative of unwraveling the ship's mystery and the race to save my daughter kept me compelled to finish this game in two sittings.

However, steeped in a wholesome blend of scifi-horror and retro point-and-click atmosphere I was quite mesmerized. Focusing on the next puzzle and contemplating the disturbing themes (tackled by impressively authentic writing) I played it to completion with nary a second thought about any falings.

The Brotherhood created a deeply atmospheric game, coupled with a compelling story. I highly recommend this game to fans of isometric rpgs, point and click adventures, and sic-fi horror.\n\nHowever, on a few occasions, I found puzzles to lack intuitive solutions. Some key items are very small and the player must search carefully and slowly to find key items. Also, the game is somewhat short (< 10 hours on a first play through).\n\nThose observations aside, Stasis is a game full of things to praise. I particularly enjoyed the art design of the environments and the genuine sense of dread I got navigating dark hallways.

Im not for games holding my hand, but a little hint to maybe tell me to wrap a rag around a gear on a door might help. I found myself too often spamming mouse 1 trying to find out what to do. Also, a higher graphics resolution would be appreciated, I love this artstyle, but I feel like the resolution lets it down a little.

Yes the graphics are not high resolution, but I got used to them after about ten minutes or so.  But graphics aren't everything, this game oozes with atmoshpere!  Definately play with headphones on at night, it seriously freaked me out!  Never in a million years would I think an isometric adventure game could scare me, but the ambiance and sound is abslolutely fantastic and I actually had to stop playing because I was so freaked out one night.  Not because of the jump scares, but as the story unfolds, you will start to use your imagination as to what happened on the Groomlake and it's VERY disturbing to think about it.  The antagonist is a little cliche and silly, but it doesn't ruin the experience, the rest o f the game is fantastic and the ending will seriously make you think and wonder what it means.  Well done Chris, I backed this game during the Kickstarter and I don't regret it one bit.  Hopefully Chris will create some DLC or Stasis 2 so we can continue the story as it does end on a bit of a cliffhanger.

Stasis is a inventory puzzle based adventure game that tells its story primarily through atmosphere and diary entries with a focus on body horror and gore. It owes a lot of its storytelling to 90's PC games, and I was really shocked to see this sort of uncompromising game released in 2015. The narrative of unwraveling the ship's mystery and the race to save my daughter kept me compelled to finish this game in two sittings.

I bought this game via Steam sale along with a few others and decided to try it out a couple days ago.  I'm not sure how far I'm in with the game, but I do know that this will be one of the few games that I actually complete.  Lately games have caught my attention for a bit and I end up moving on to something else.\n\nSome of the CONS I mention might have been done on purpose and I'll explain why next to the CON, see below.\n\nPros:\n+Dark & Eerie\n+Minimum music, but just enough.  Game has a lot of different sound effects though, sorta creepy.\n+Not too difficult point and click.  Items that you should interact with aren't hidden behind 16bit backgrounds, so missing something isn't that common.\n+Cool interactive puzzles.\n+Voice acting is okay.\n+The story so far is good.\n+Graphics are decent, could be better but I'm not sure?  I'll explain below in the CONS section.\n+Era/setting of which game takes place.  -Minor- spoiler Future (year 2152 or something similar), onboard a ship, dystopia/cyberpunk type.\n\nCons:\n-Too many PDA's to read.  I guess you don't HAVE to read them, but, if you want to understand what is going on, then you should.  I like games where you read journals, but this has a lot of them and some can have up to 12/14 entries with each entry being a paragraph long.\n-Graphics aren't HD (1080), seems like the game was meant for 720 (if that).  I can see how the developers did this on purpose.  It sorta adds to the ambiance of the area your character is in.  If it was too clear, then it wouldn't be as scary I guess?\n-No options for video or audio settings.  NONE.  Now, this might have been done on purpose to prevent people from turning up the brightness too high or shutting off certain settings that might take away from it's eerieness.\n-So far, no action scenes that you can control.  You mainly die by a failed puzzle or something in the room your in.  It would have been nice to fight something (maybe you do later? idk.)\n-Character inventory is kind of weak, your character doesn't ever get a change of clothes (so far) and isn't detailed... he almost looks naked.\n\nTL;DR\n\nWould I recommend for $15 -   YES.\nWould I recommend to point & click adventurers - YES","December 28, 2015","true","7.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you like creepy and you like adventure games, this is for you. With an interesting story, flawless graphics and a good length (around 11 hours), this is a game you can't pass up. (Very impressive for a game with the programming, graphics and writing done by one guy.)\n\nI got this game after reading comparisons to Santitarium, a game I finally played all the way through recently, and while there are some things I liked more about Santitarium, overall Stasis is definitely the better game. Of course, both appeal to my interest in the dark and creepy and weird, so I recommend both!\n\nThe graphics are perhaps the biggest draw for me. They are amazing; just check out the trailers! It's hard to tell if the backgrounds are prerendered 2D images, or really well done 3D. The usual issues in video game graphics of jaggies and blurry textures are nonexistent here. I cannot praise enough the way this game looks.\n\nI only have 2 minor issues.\n\nThe first is that don't like reading very much, and much of the game's story is told through text found on PDAs and computer terminals. No big deal and it's not a lot of writing, but a couple times I did have to put the game away because I didn't feel up to the reading I saw coming.\n\nThe second is that the game suffers from the biggest flaw that adventure games have: occassionally not being able to figure out how to progress. Sometimes this is caused by missing an item in the environment that you need, sometimes because the developers logic if a little different than yours, and sometimes because you didn't pay enough attention to subtle clues.\n\nFor example, if you are shot dead by a motion-detecting turret when trying to move to the next area, it's safe to assume you need to deal with it before you can proceed. In the game, there were three deaths that caused me confusion. Two of the times I looked around for ages trying to determine how to get past what killed me, and the other time I assumed what had killed me was a trap and not something necessary to progress. As it turns out, two of the solutions were about timing, and the third was simply about activating the item from a slightly different location.\n\nIf you can get through the game without a walkthrough, well done! Most of the time it's pretty easy to figure out what to do next, but as with most adventure games I recommend keeping a walkthough open in a tab JUST IN CASE you need it.\n\n9/10","January 1","true","11.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Taking place on a research ship called the Groomlake, a man named John wakes up from Stasis in a mysterious and dangerous situation and must find his family and escape from the horrors aboard.\n\nTo get the bad out of the way first, this is definitely a flawed game. The animations have really jerky transitions which are jarring, there's a lot of "adventure game" logic where you do unintuitive things to progress, and the pacing at times is gods awful slow. When you're walking across a room at a crawl, possibly literally, it's easy to get bored or frustrated. The isometric viewpoint occasionally makes it difficult to tell where you can go or what you can interact with.\n\nHowever, it does a lot of things right. It's creepy. It's disturbing. It makes you want to know more about the setting and the events. There are a lot of interesting setpieces. Some of the puzzles actually are really clever or interesting when they're not running on vague logic. The voice acting, music, and sound effects are pretty good as well. The graphics and visual design is fantastic, top to bottom, and you definitely feel like you're in a derelict spacecraft where something unspeakable has happened.\n\nThe game runs about 7-8 hours, but aside from achievements, there's not a ton of reason to replay it. There are no story branches. There are no secrets really to miss (again, outside of a handful of achievements). But many adventure games share this same problem, so it's more of an issue with the genre as a whole than Stasis in specific. I did enjoy my time with the game and would recommend it to people who like their horror mixed with sci-fi or like their adventure games with a darker shade.","January 5","true","8.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Kudos if you can get through this game without looking up any answers.\n\nI also found that I personally enjoyed Sanitariums story more. Communicating with other characters played a big roll in that game, and it was completely voiced over, prepare for ALLOT of reading if you want an engaging story in Stasis.\n\nAll in all I do think this game is worth buying.

I was promised a good game with great, eerie graphics and a disturbingly dark story line.  I received everything I was promised.  Stasis engaged me from the beginning and, though it is relatively short (it took me about two days of semi-casual gaming), it was worth the purchase in my mind.\n\nSince people tend to put their likes and dislikes into lists, I'll adhere to that pattern:\n\nPros:\n1 - A lot of thought went into the story.  The journals are written well and describe with increasing terror the events on the vessel.  You also get a lot of human emotion and insights into the minds and relationships of characters you will never meet.   It's pretty well-edited; this grammar enthusiast noticed only a couple small mispellings or grammar missteps, not enough to distract from the story.\n2 - The graphics are beautiful, if a little disturbing at times.  But that's what I paid for.\n3 - The soundtrack is fantastic.  The extra money paid for the stretch goal was well worth it.\n4 - Interesting puzzles without being TOO difficult to solve.  Think slightly easier than a Grim Fandango-type game.  The obvious solutions aren't always the correct ones, and the correct ones often make you feel bad about yourself for accomplishing them.\n5 - The ending is... well, you'll see it.  It doesn't disappoint.\n6 - The creepiness is pretty high, on this one.  And it's not just "scare the player with motion and light!" creepiness, it's that the entire setting is unsettling, and only grows moreso.  The sound effects definitely assist this.\n7 - Almost everything in the vessel has a disturbing description about it that made me question whether I should bother trying to sleep.\n8 - It's addicting.  I stayed up much longer than usual the first night I played it because I wanted to finish a puzzle.\n\nCons:\nI couldn't find many things I *disliked* about the game, but there were a couple things that I found distracted me a bit.\n1 - The pathwalking by the protagonist was occasionally fairly hokey.  Taking the long route thrugh a room just because.\n2 - It isn't a long game.  It doesn't bother me for a game of this quality, but may bother others.\n3 - Thereare a couple of minor graphical glitches in certain parts of the game; these are easy to work around or reverse.\n4 - Do you like to read a lot?  Then refer to #1 in the Pro section.  If you don't, this belongs in the Cons.  But you really should enjoy the stories.\n5 - The kitty.  When you meet her, you'll know.  :(\n\nAll in all, I highly recommend this game to the casual player who's looking for something to pass the time while keeping him engaged.","September 6, 2015","true","14.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game just somehow popped up and happens to be a sci-fi horror gem.\nI'm not an avid point'n'click player, which might make this review obsolete for some, probably just the gameplay part though.\n\nStory (as spoiler-free as possible):\nYou're playing as John Malchovic, a dude originally on his way to Titan with his wife and child. Of course, things change when you wake up on an unknown ship that's definetly seen better times. You try to figure out what's going on and uncover some horrible things; but most importantly, the maingoal is to find your family.\n\nThis might sound cliché (which it is) but it is presented so well and gains amazing depth over the course of about 6 hours.\nTL;DR: Story is cliché but with amazing twists and surprising depth.\n\nGameplay:\nOf course, you click things. The left mouse button is the only thing you need, just what you'd expect from a point'n'click.\nYour cursor changes, indicating a possible interaction but that's about all the help you'll get, besides a faint glow on some items and all readable things. Ah yes, reading. There's alot here, some even giving you hints on how to solve a puzzle.\nStuck on a puzzle? Scan the room with your cursor line by line and hope for new things to pop up.\nAtleast, that was my experience. That ain't bad, mind you.\nEvery puzzle is logical, some require more brain than others. All in all, they are well placed, fit seamlessly in the story and  convey a great sense of accomplishment.\n\nHORROR:\nNot much in terms of jumpscares, so you better pack up your facecam and say goodbye to that EZ CASH.\nThe game lives off of the thick atmosphere it creates. You have a few shockers here and there but mostly just depressing PDA entries and a devestated ship. It's more of a thriller, with a constant feeling of dread. Not much more to say, it's great.\n\nAll in all, a great game, but the steam price seems a bit too much. I paid ten bucks for it and I feel that I'd pay a maximum of 15€.","September 29, 2015","true","6.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I think it's the potential the genre has for narrative.\n\nSTASIS really doesn't disappoint in that regard. It does a whole lot with a very barebones start, no less. The story is a bit tired, the voice acting can occasionally be grating, there are three characters in the entire game and they're all pretty trope-heavy. Despite this, it's an excellent game.\n\nThe PDA logs were an unusually interesting experience. While I will usually skim these pretty religiously for clues and information, I found that the plentiful PDAs were slightly redundant, offering very colorful and diverse persoectives on what was sometimes overlapping information. Each of the characters' stories were fascinating, which is probably part of why the whole experience was so riveting. Perhaps what was best, was that in the event you missed one, you weren't screwed in the long run. You will not want to miss them, though, because they're half the fun.\n\nThe puzzles were not overly difficult. I'm by no means a master at these things, so I had to walk away for a few minutes from time to time, but I was able to negotiate the entire game without ever resorting to a guide, in a pretty reasonable amount of time, about ten hours. None of the puzzles was difficult enough to really break the narrative pacing, I felt.\n\nThe imagery was great for such a simple media. THe game does a lot with a little, again, in this regard.\n\nVoice acting was a little bit rough in places. The daughter in the first flashback, for example, was so bad that I was convinced briefly that there was something wrong with my computer or with the game. It worked beautifully whenever it counted, though, and was never really grating.\n\nIf you're not the patient sort, you may want to give this one a pass, because it is extremely sluggish, as these games can some times be. If you enjoy a very dark narrative with some very cool puzzles and imaginitive design, you'll want to grab this one in a hurry.","January 20","true","9.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is very nice. And creepy, definitely that. Kind of short but I suppose that is expected, given the half-a-shoe-string budget it had. However, those few hours were filled with being creeped out doing weird things to make the main character survive.\n\nSpoilery stuff coming up, beware.\nSome reviews say the ending sucked. I disagree. Sure, brutal murders were dished out but you know what, not every game has to have a happy ending where everyone survives and get rescued. In this case everyone died. It's a bit of a fresh air in the otherwise everything-is-filled-with-roses world of game endings.\n\nAwesome game.","January 20","true","6.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/towo/recommended/380150/","towo","towo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/towo/","890 products in account","Stasis is a pretty decent point and click, isometric adventure game. Think of this like a horror setting for an isometric adventure game without any combat. The lack of combat makes it a very "relaxing" game, if the theme of the game itself does not unsettly you duly. There are a few, namely two, locations where timing is an issue, but that's about the height of gameplay-related stress you'll experience.\n\nThe game itself features a fairly interesting, if slightly standard, story. The puzzles involved are fairly straightforward, except for a few that suffer from the usual "combine everything with everything and hope it works" approach. As such, is not a particularly challenging game in itself.\n\nWith regards to the game itself, it is rather short - I'm guessing anyone but the most inexperienced players will be hard pressed to tickle a two-digit playtime count.\n\nSo, in summary, a fairly enjoyable, straightforward adventure game with a somewhat decent story. If you want a low-intensity snack of an adventure for an evening or two of slightly distracted gaming, go for it. If you want something with meat behind it that consumes your time, you'll be better of elsewhere.","January 29","true","6.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game differentiates itself from the genre, generally, by placing you in a horrifying environment, whereas most such games are more whimsical.\n\nThe horror aspect of the game is compelling, and truly, truly dark. The very environments feel threatening, and the use of sound adds tremendously to the experience. Adding to that, the story is supremely twisted. I'm not even going to go into the lifeforms you'll encounter.\n\nAs a point and click game, I found it to be a bit lacking.  Solving a puzzle of course allows the player to progress to a new area or overcome an obstacle. The puzzles, though, consist of trying to find all of the objects you can interact with, then finding and picking up all of the objects that can be picked up, then utilizing trial and error by using the things you've picked up on the objects you can interact with, sometimes accompanied by attempting to combine whatever you've picked up with other things you've picked up.  Sure, some of the puzzles can be intuited, but most of the time I found myself just using trial and error. For example, how would I have known to (1) put a slab of flesh on a prep table, (2) smash the flesh with the butt of a gun, and then (3) insert the personal data tag? And why would the surgery machine need a hunk of human flesh to operate properly, and more importantly, how could I have known that in the game? And how could I have known that blowing up a sentry gun would create a hole in the floor that proceeds to an area I had no idea existed? I eventually just got fed up with playing virtual scavenger hunt and followed walkthroughs when it wasn't obvious what needed to be done.  That was pretty disappointing.  And yes, I did read every single PDA entry carefully, sometimes more than once.\n\nThe story is quite strong, even if the crux of it (finding your lost wife and daughter) is a standard and unsophisticated video game trope. Your character's well-paced peregrination through the ship slowly unveils the full picture of what happened and why, culminating in chilling revelations and gruesome, morbid events.  The grimness of it all provides an interesting backdrop for the central theme of the game: the risks of private research organizations acting unethically. This is a "mature theme" I mentioned at the start as much as the gore and violence in this game.\n\nButtressing the game's atmosphere was the excellent integration and use of sound, superb voice acting (maybe with one exception), and an undistracting UI. I did find the inset character graphics (what appears when a character is speaking) to be a bit crude, especially that of the main character, unfortunately. Also, the character's pathfinding was unnatural at times and distracted from the immersion. Lastly, at a few points I was forced to listen to the same long, scripted dialogue sequences over and over again as I failed to perform exactly the right action--there was no "skip" function.\n\nAll in all, the game provides an immersive and enjoyable experience for fans of point and click games and the horror genre, though not without a few drawbacks, the biggest of which is the abstruseness of many of the puzzles. Despite those, I do recommend this game to those of you who enjoy this type of game, as it provides a compelling horror experience with good writing and a developed theme.","February 3","true","8.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED)\n\nThere are some minor complaints, but for the most part this is an adventure game every adventure fan should have in their collection.\nPROS:\n- Great atmosphere that portrays perfectly the feelings of isolation and depression\n- Great musical score\n- Beautiful 2D hand drawn isometric backgrounds\n- Great voice performance by the main character. The voice performance in general was very good and the only character who souned weird was John's daughter, but she doesn't have too many lines, so its not a gamebreaking.\n- Very logical puzzles, although they could be a bit harder in my opinion.\n- Interesting and engaging sci-fi-horror storyline with a shocking ending.\n- Many surprises and small touches that make you appreciate what the developers did with limitted tools they had at their disposal. For example, almost seamless transition between the game and video sequences, crawling in the air ducts,  riding various vehicles, the operation part, etc. There is so much variation between the areas and how they are presented to you that the game never becomes boring.\n\nCONS: (Most of these things are minor gripes, but I need to mention them):\n- DEATHS. This is a personal preferance, but I do not like deaths in adventure games. This is because most adventure games use cheap unpredictable deaths to kill you. Stasis is a bit better and you get hints you are about to die, but still it feels a bit cheap. For example, when I opened the furnace, the computer starts talking to warn you of the dange, but you die even before the computer is finished. So I died not because I was too stupid to run away, but because I didnt realize I have control over my character while I was waiting for the computer to finish it's sentence.\n- The game seems to be divided into different sections, so when you clear one section you never can go back. This results in puzzles being very localized and as a consequence much easier to solve. You will never have more than 5 items to work with, which makes progression much easier. Not a big issue (if an issue at all), but I wish the game forced you to go back a bit.\n- Majority of puzzles rely on you noticing details around you and then putting them together in order to solve a puzzle. As long as you are observant, you will not have any problems with any of the puzzles. I wish there were at least 1 or 2 puzzles that required genuine intelligence to go further.\n-The game did an excellent job in keeping puzzles logical. However there is 1 instance that does not make any sense. When you need to look at the corpse in a cage in order to trigger an event that leads to your capture by the mad scientist. There is no way to figure this out! The problem is that you trigger the afore mentioned event by using the eye symbol, which took me completely by surprise and it felt like a very artificial way to move the storyline forward. Unless you walk by or press on that cage by accident or curiosity, you will get stuck for no apparent reason.\n- I liked reading the logs and they are very well written (am ignoring a few typos here),  but 2 complaints:\n1. The whole premise of the game is to save your family. This creates a big sense of urgency which makes you want to skip over the logs.\n2. Also, why does nobody on that ship ever lock their journal entries with a password? Even when they talk about things they dont want other crew members to find about!\n- The game seems to build this huge story about SAMANTHA, but it never goes anywhere with it.\n- Pathfinding can be awkward from time to time.\n\nI know I have mentioned quite a few things in my CONS section, but quite honestly they are not huge issues and some of them stem purely from my personal preferences. I give it 8/10 and recommend it warmly. I also hope we will get a sequel or more adventure games from this developer!","January 24","true","11.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The authors did not use tiles or sprites.  Every inch of this game:  the overheads, the cut scenes, the close-up, functional views of various tech is thoughtfully, painstakingly hand-crafted.  In terms of creating a plausible-feeling atmosphere for what it might be like to live and work in space, STASIS has set a new high bar.\n\nUnfortunately, the art is paired with fairly lukewarm gameplay and a story that's disjointed and boring.  I could live with the bad point-and-click gameplay, but by the end, I was just anxious for the thing to be over.  The unskippable voice acting snippets add little.  There is a lot of background reading that's intended to fill in the background, but most of that is even more boring than the main story.  By the end you will be briefly skimming the contents of the NPC diary entries, if that.  It was an interesting idea, but just seems silly after a while.\n\nThe gameplay and puzzles -- all of it -- can be summarized with one question:  what thing in this room do I need to click on next? If it wasn't immediately obvious what to do after 10 seconds, I usually looked it up because there really is no point in trying to figure anything out.\n\nSTASIS stands out among isometric games for its brilliant art and dark, horrific atmosphere.  Coupled with its pedstrian gameplay and weak story, it was less fun than I would have liked.  I still recommend the game for the glimpses you will get about what day-to-day life on a doomed research vessel would actually feel like.\n","January 25","true","7.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Enjoyed this game so much I purchased other point and click type games to see if this was the norm.  Goes without saying that is not my usual type of game; give it a try.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wolfsamurai/recommended/380150/","wolfsamurai","WolfSamurai","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wolfsamurai/","938 products in account","Stasis is a point and click sci-fi adventure game with hades of Dead Space and Event Horizon. Taking place on a research ship called the Groomlake, a man named John wakes up from Stasis in a mysterious and dangerous situation and must find his family and escape from the horrors aboard.\n\nTo get the bad out of the way first, this is definitely a flawed game. The animations have really jerky transitions which are jarring, there's a lot of "adventure game" logic where you do unintuitive things to progress, and the pacing at times is gods awful slow. When you're walking across a room at a crawl, possibly literally, it's easy to get bored or frustrated. The isometric viewpoint occasionally makes it difficult to tell where you can go or what you can interact with.\n\nHowever, it does a lot of things right. It's creepy. It's disturbing. It makes you want to know more about the setting and the events. There are a lot of interesting setpieces. Some of the puzzles actually are really clever or interesting when they're not running on vague logic. The voice acting, music, and sound effects are pretty good as well. The graphics and visual design is fantastic, top to bottom, and you definitely feel like you're in a derelict spacecraft where something unspeakable has happened.\n\nThe game runs about 7-8 hours, but aside from achievements, there's not a ton of reason to replay it. There are no story branches. There are no secrets really to miss (again, outside of a handful of achievements). But many adventure games share this same problem, so it's more of an issue with the genre as a whole than Stasis in specific. I did enjoy my time with the game and would recommend it to people who like their horror mixed with sci-fi or like their adventure games with a darker shade.","January 5","true","8.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Mix of modern and some old school style adventuring (had to use a pen and paper a few times).  Great spooky, space atmosphere; was actually startled a couple of times.  Really nice production values when into this.  A good amount of reading of logs and such to add to the back story...sick (in a good way).  Music and sound effects were great.  Puzzles were relatively fair.   It was easy to overlook items if not careful which can lead to a little back-tracking (but not too much).  I generally felt the pace was good; one puzzle took me too long due to not quite understanding the concept and having to repeat it too many times (just the point I was getting annoyed, but not beyond...).   I highly recommend trying to die when you get a chance (in the game I mean) as the animations are usually cool.   For achievement hunters, a few extra hours to rap those up are in order.

I was somewhat hesitant given that I had heard no reviews but after taking a look at the trailer I was intrigued so I picked it up.  No regrets!  From the very beginning I was hooked and felt compelled to finish it.  The story is great and well fleshed out if you take the time to read the abundance of PDAs left behind by the former residents of the ship.  This game is kinda like Dead Space meets Event Horizon with old school Diablo-esque isometric graphics.  The art, music and voice acting acting are all fantastic and several times I stopped just to appreciate the work that went into crafting these environments.  Overall it's one of the best point-and-click adventure games I've ever played and absolutely worth the asking price.  It's not, however, a game for anyone with a weak stomach or an adversion to violence and gore.  I find myself eagerly awaiting the next game from The Brotherhood, this being their first foray into game development.\n\nPros:  Superb art, music and voice acting.  Fast paced throughout with an excellent story and well crafted characters.  Very strong opening and middle acts.\n\nCons:  A bit short (took me about 8 and a half hours at a leisurely pace).  Some of the puzzles required brute force to solve and can be a bit frustrating although I pride myself at never having to look up any guides for assistance.  The final act doesn't pack the punch of the opening and middle but it was still satisfying.\n\nTL;DR:  Buy it.  It's worth it.","September 20, 2015","true","8.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Everything about it intrigued me. Isometric horror? Sci-fi? I had to check it out and after completing the game I have to say I enjoyed every second of the game. The story is one that is pretty standard as far as sci-fi horror goes, but it's done very well. The gameplay isn't anything to write home about, but  thats okay because it's from your exploration of every inch and your reading of every data log and PDA that really makes this an enjoying experience. You really get a vivid picture of the horrors that unfolded and you get to also experience the viewpoint of several different people of different statuses as it unfolds. The sheer detail put into this was amazing. The puzzles weren't very hard although I did miss some items a few times and figuring that out was quite a pain. One thing to note, the developers added several gruesome ways to die(some of which by your own hand) and finding all of this is brutally entertaining.  I finished the game in just under 9 hours, which isnt very long, but in my opinion was a very enjoyable 9 hours. Overall I recommend this game to any fan of sc-fi horror as it is definitely worth a playthrough.","May 8","true","8.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I am a huge fan of both science fiction and adventure games, so this seemed to be made for me, but i just didn't enjoy it. First, the good. The artwork and sound design is incredible. The spaceship is epic sci-fi gothic à la Event Horizon, and the body horror is Cronenberg levels of disturbing. The sounds are razor-sharp and creepy as hell. Unfortunately beautiful art and sound is all it's got, because the story is paper-thin. It's an entirely predictable journey through sci-fi tropes we've seen a hundred times before, without any of the clever twists or storytelling tricks we've come to expect from adventure games these days.\n\nI don't feel like this deserves a thumbs down based on its aesthetic - it truly is beautiful - but adventure games to me are all about the story and characters. Stasis stretches out a B-grade horror yarn into 6-7 hours, and unfortunately overstays its welcome as a result. Maybe it would've worked better in episodic form. All that said, props to the developers for uniquely taking a typical "action" story and putting it into an adventure game instead of a first-person shooter. Perhaps there is a market for this somewhere.","December 26, 2015","false","6.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","2"

A game where you must think, and not react simply pulling a trigger to anything that moves.\n\nThere's a lot to be said about a game released in 2015 that shares most of it's qualities from a game made in 1998. A lot of good things.\n\nStasis nails the environment, the atmosphere and the element of tension. The thought that at any moment something could end you. Waking up and feeling like there is nowhere safe, and having no idea what is happening, that feeling, captured perfectly.\n\nI can say with 100% conviction, that I have always wanted to go to space. Growing up on the space coast tends to make one have fancy thoughts of space operas and flying cars. I can also say with 100% conviction, that if space is anything like this you can take me off that damn list of canditates\n\nThere is screaming all around you, but no clue what it is. There's a helpful person on the radio and a less helpful person who has issues with helpful person, and by association, you.\n\nThe animations are smooth, the audio is wonderful.\n\nSo far in my time with the game, I've woken up (I'm always cranky at this point in my day). I've realized I've lost my kid and wife somewhere on this trip of ours. I've made a new friend as well as enemy and chopped someone's arm off. I have also blown myself up a couple of times as well as having been consumed by sludge zombie things and to really top it all off, I've taken a face-full of acid. And that's just my first few hours with the game.\n\nThis is another game that I can see becoming a classic, not because it re-defines a type of game, but because it takes something that worked years ago and makes it pure. Playing this I had flashes back to when I was younger and playing any of the old isometric point and click games, and that is awesome. There aren't enough games in the world that are solid enough to remind me of what gaming used to be like before everything became DLC and season passes. It's nice sitting down and knowing that I can play this game all the way through if I have the nerve to do so.\n\n\nSo, for the question of the hour. Does Elenath recommend this game?\n\nWithout a doubt. For the price you can't beat the story and immersion.\nYou get to kill yourself over and over again just to see if that pool stick was really needed for this puzzle. Pointing this out again, It's a game that makes you think your way out instead of shoot. So if you're here for John Woo Vs Space potatoes get out now. But if you're inclined to use that beautiful bowling ball on your shoulders and figure out what you have to do, then this is a game for you. Best way to say it is it's a slow, beautiful top down space game that shares some elements with Dead Space and the mystery of Event Horizon.\n\nThere's also (I think) a nod to Boondock Saints. So win win.\n\nPrice at launch will be 24.99 with a 20% discount for the first week making the standard version 19.99 or the Deluxe with all the goods 32. (soundtrack, wallpapers, art book and game) in my humble opinion go with the latter, the music is worth the price difference alone.\n\nMy final comment is that there is a great story buried in here, that requires you to wander around and explore to get it. The people that you find, or find what's left of them, you care about them before everything went to hell. They are written as if they are real people, something that sometimes is lost in games.\n\nDespite this games visuals, there is nothing 2D about it.","August 31, 2015","true","3.2"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

Mutilated bodies are scattered everywhere, walls are drenched in blood, and horrifying screams can be heard coming from other decks. I also have a distinct feeling that someone, or some thing, is lurking in the shadows, watching me. I only have one mission and that is to find my wife and daughter and get off this godforsaken ship. But considering what I have seen, is such a goal even reasonable?\n\nStasis is a 2D isometric adventure game with a science fiction horror theme. It follows the story of one John Maracheck, who has been put in stasis, along with his family, during a tourist space trip. As he wakes up and emerges from his pod, it becomes clear that he wasn’t where he was supposed to be. John finds himself on a monolithic spacecraft called Groomlake, which is currently orbiting Neptune. In his desperate search for his wife and daughter, John will uncover the horrifying truth hidden deep in the bowels of the ship.\n\nThe best way to play Stasis is to have as little information about the story as possible, so I will not go into any more detail. However, I can say that Stasis weaves an incredibly bleak dystopian narrative that will not leave any player unnerved. I can also say that the story is superbly written and features believable, compelling characters. The voice actors put up a great performance, which definitely contributes to the overall experience. Still, my favorite moments regarding the writing were reading the scattered PDA journal entries. This is a storytelling mechanic that is used quite often in video games and yet so few games actually manage to use it well. I usually find myself skipping such entries because they are simply boring and lifeless. Stasis, on the other hand, pulls off this storytelling mechanic magnificently. Almost every single entry paints a vivid, compelling, and absolutely convincing relationship between unseen characters. Most of these entries are actually not at all relevant to the crux of the story, but they provide such an invaluable, personal look into what was life like aboard the Groomlake before and after the incident.\n\nRegarding the presentation, Stasis features a very dark and grim art style. It was obviously very much influenced by the Alien film series, a fact immediately made clear in the opening scene of the game. But as much as this influence is readily apparent, Stasis nevertheless defiantly remains its own beast, in both narrative and presentation. The music in the game is relatively sparse, but it sounds good whenever it makes an appearance. On the other hand, the sound effects are a high point of the game throughout. Strange creaking noises, chilling distant screams, and the rumbling of machines all contribute to the creation of a thick atmosphere.\n\nThe gameplay in Stasis is classic point-and-click adventure. The adventure genre proved to be a tough space for designers because the line between a logical yet challenging puzzle and a puzzle that will keep you bewildered and frustrated before you finally just give up is a very thin one indeed. This sort of impenetrable design led to adventure games falling out of favor some years back and still remains one of the greatest pitfalls of the genre. When you play Stasis, you will realize that this is adventure game design done right. The puzzles are logical and make sense within the setting. They also provide just the right amount of challenge that makes solving every puzzle feel like a true accomplishment and keeps the pace going. What is interesting about Stasis is that you can actually die. These deaths are scripted, of course, and require solving a puzzle to move on, but it still keeps you on your toes a bit. What is completely unique about Stasis is that in certain situations you can commit suicide and just end it all.\n\nThere were a few issues. In some scenes, the game is simply overly dark to the point that I could not figure out the layout of the level and I could not even see where John was standing. Also, John’s pathfinding is somewhat curious. He will walk on a straight line no matter the surroundings, which just looks odd when he’s walking around a desk or something, as if he is a robot. He also tends to take the longer route, for some reason. The animations are quite outdated. These are obviously not big problems, but in a game that is so reliant on immersion and atmosphere, everything that pulls you out of it is a problem.\n\nStasis makes several strong statements. It showcases that there is a lot of life left in classic adventure game design and that you do not need a big budget to create a game with a rich atmosphere. This is a science fiction horror game of a rarer breed, it doesn’t seek to scare you at every moment, but rather it tries to build up an eerie, macabre mood and get into your head. A resounding success in that regard, Stasis is a grim game that grabs your attention and holds it until the very end.\n\n8 OUT OF 10 (GREAT)","October 21, 2015","true","10.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The price is just insane for the quality of game you're getting.\n\nInitially, the atmosphere and story drew me in to this game but then I quickly realized that the game is nowhere near as good as I thought it was. It just feels like they had a decent premise, but the quality is very inconsistent and could use a LOT more work. To start off, there's hardly any character development so you don't really care about your character or your family who you're trying to save at all. The story was cliche to the point where it was painful, and the majority of the voice acting was hard to listen to because it was so bad. It would'ntve been so bad if the game was at least fun to play, but that brings me to my biggest issue with this game, the gameplay.\n\nBecause it's point&click, it revolves around puzzles, and the puzzles in the game are pure garbage. Most of them make NO ♥♥♥♥ING SENSE, like you don't even know what your goal is, you just randomly go through all these rooms and click all this ♥♥♥♥ because there isn't anything else you can actually do. ♥♥♥♥ around for a few minutes, and either find a solution or get frustrated and look up a walkthrough for the 7th time. The logic is completely ♥♥♥♥ed, like he just picks up this random ♥♥♥♥ that seems to have no use then BAM it all fits perfectly. For example, at one part he SQUISHES SOME DEAD GUY'S HEAD IN and TAKES HIS ♥♥♥♥ING EYEBALL. Then, he puts it in A GOD DAMN MACHINE?????? Like honestly what. It really was an excersize in frustration for me to play through some parts of this game. Add the fact that every area is littered with these personal diaries that just drawl on and on for pages about someone's experience on board the ship. They're all essentially the same ♥♥♥♥ with different people, the worst thing is some of them actually give you hints you'll need to complete a puzzle so you have to read through so much pointless filler to get anything done. It's just such a ♥♥♥♥ poor way to tell a story in a game, it only served to add to the frustration of the terrible puzzles and dialogue.\n\nAnother thing is the dying system, the game just randomly kills you out of nowhere (example, open a door BAM you're ♥♥♥♥ing shot down like a pig) and forces you to replay everything you did before you got to that point. It's expecially excrutiating when they put an unskippable cutscene right before one of these unexpected deaths so you're forced through 15-30 seconds of dialogue just to trial-and-error to get past this obstacle and maybe ♥♥♥♥ing die again. At times I felt myself thinking 'Who the actual ♥♥♥♥ could put this in a game and not think it was a bad idea? Like did they test this game at all?'\n\nThere are some stand-out moments, but they're drowned by the heavy slog of playing through most of the boring parts. And one more thing, the whole time they were building up these monsters and NOT ONCE IN THE ENTIRE GAME ARE YOU THREATENED BY ONE. The only way you die is by doing some stupid ♥♥♥♥. A real let-down.\n\nIn conclusion, I felt this was a promising game that somewhere along the line, crashed and burned horribly leaving a miserable husk of the game it could've been. It was good enough that I felt that I had to finish it, but it was ♥♥♥♥ING HELL at times. You may think I have anger issues reading this review but I don't, I just finished the game and felt very strongly the need to vent some steam in review form. I wish I could have my money back and also to have not experienced this game.","September 15, 2015","false","14.9"," 17 of 36 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","17","36","0","2"

Oftentimes the writing gets extremely poetic, for lack of a better word, and it feels like the writer(s) has had heavy use of a thesaurus just to use big words, and that just annoys me. (This is absolutely personal taste, I'm just not a fan of using big words just for the sake of using big words)\n\nAll in all, the most important part of the game is where it fails the most, and because of this I simply can't recommend it.","September 14, 2015","false","8.2"," 11 of 24 people (46%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","46","11","24","2","0"

My other only grip would be the lengthy Game Over sequence which - coupled with unskippable dialogues - transformed certain sequences into a chore (I’m looking at you, end sequence with Doctor mad-with-power Malan).\n\nBut my biggest issue with this game is the voice acting. The voice actors aren’t bad per se, though. The writing is terrible, and that’s what killed the connection between me and the game. I get the character is a civilian and should be freaked out by everything that happens in the ship… but I’m not : I want to progress and stay alive, not to stop and lament. The game quickly sets the mood that something ♥♥♥♥ed up really bad, so the player is naturally inclined to 1) find out what happened and 2) leave this mess as soon as possible. Thus, it becomes quickly annoying when the game rubs it in your face with unskippable dialogue: “OH GOD THIS PLACE IS SO MESSED UP! LOOK HOW MUCH IT’S DISGUSTING AND NAUSEATING! LOOK, YOUR CHARACTER IS PUCKING! YOU SHOULD FEEL SICKENED!”\nThe same could be said for the whole find your family subplot : the game forcefully tries to make you care for basically two sprites with little character development and of course it kills them for shock and horror while I couldn’t care less.\n\n\nI think Stasis would have been a much better game without the voice acting, without all the subplots and predictable twists (which are even more obvious if you’ve played  Dead Space): just you, the ship, the horrors that lurk beneath its hull, and the dim light at the end of the tunnel.","September 13, 2015","false","5.7"," 10 of 22 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","10","22","0","0"

The puzzles are illogical, and progress boils down to hovering your pointer over every square inch of screen to find the stuff you can interact with. Once you do find something to interact with, you will mindlessly start trying to combine each item of your inventory with the object until something finally works.\n\nThere is a voice via a com link that sorta helps you along by opening locked doors and providing you with hints and such, but most of the story is delivered through text logs scattered seemingly everywhere throughout the game. Nothing new for an adventure game, but it seems like the text was written by a fifth grade English teacher. Judy Blume could write a better horror story.\n\nAnother of my least favorite aspects of any game is backtracking. This game will have you traveling from area A to areas B, C, and D, then from area D back through areas C, B, and A, ad nauseum. This completely diminishes any redeeming aesthetic qualities you might initially enjoy from this graphically challenged game.\n\nI do like the sound effects and voice acting. This game would actually be a little more enjoyable to play if I could finish it with my eyes closed.\n\nAs it stands, the game was just not scary enough to keep me engaged. I hope all the best for the devs "The Brotherhood". I try to support small indies because their games seem to connect to real gamers more than the "AAA" devs, but, unfortunately, this time it just didn't work for me.","November 8, 2015","false","4.2"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

The art was great, atmosphere was great, interesting story but the “needle in a hay stack” game play drove me to the point of quitting. As if the game isn’t dark enough you cannot see items you need to interact with for puzzles. I’m literally spending my time moving the mouse around pixel by pixel to try and find something I may have missed. Not only that but this game has some serious cryptic old school Alone in the Dark puzzle garbage. ♥♥♥♥ this ♥♥♥♥, the sad part is I know I’m pretty close to the end but I don’t care, I don’t even care to look up the ending on youtube either.

None of the previous chapters can be revisited, due to some sort of story reason (vehicle crashing, explosion just as you leave etc.).\n\nThe only deviations from the main path are hidden deaths and exposition dumps in the form of computer terminals or PDAs. The story sequences cannot be skipped, whether they be cutscenes or long dialogue scenes (which are fully voice-acted), with no options to increase text speed or skip through them.\n\nThe puzzles mainly consist of: find the item, find what it goes with. There are only a few examples of puzzles in which you're presented with clues of some sort and have to figure it out, either by working out a sequence based on another you've been given or putting together a few clues in order to work out a combination.\n\nSometimes the puzzles are very badly clued when it comes to the items, very much being trial and error. e.g.  one has you putting an oxygen tank in a machine, only to be told that it's too small, but doesn't say it it isn't long enough or too narrow etc.. so you have to combine it with another item. The problem here is that you can't get a close look at the machine, so you don't know how you're expected to make it fit, until you happen to combine the right items.\n\nThe item finding can feel very much like pixel-hunting, but for the most part the items have some sort of light on them indicating that it can be interacted with, so you never really have to scour the maps to find stuff.\n\nDespite the nature of the game, there're very few occasions in which you find yourself in immediate danger, only two in fact, and both of these are you quickly reacting or ending up shot to death, rather than anything you would expect in a horror game.\n\nYou can save anywhere, and I recommend you do as the checkpoints are mostly just behind long dialogue or story sequences.\n\nThe combination of the movement speed of your character (especially when crawling), the unskippable dialogue and the cutscenes makes the game move at a very slow pace.\n\n* Everything after here is simply my personal opinion, all above it is just an explanation of the gameplay *\n\nThe story and characters are nothing new or special:\n- Guy wakes up on abandoned space station/lab\n- There very few survivors\n- There's someone who guides you\n- You have to find your family\n- There's ONE other survivor who's an ♥♥♥ and wants to kill you\n- There's an allusion to the holocaust, complete with gas chambers in space (no really)\n- Betrayal that you see coming a mile away\n- Tragedy\n- All corporation are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s\n- Science is evil\n- Our character is the ONE moral light in a sea of darkness and is completely good and pure in every way\n\nThe voice acting is passable, and the music is ok. I'm not really bothered by these things in case you couldn't tell.\n\nAll in all, there's nothing original or new as far as gameplay and story goes. For the gameplay, the game is linear and slow, the puzzles are obvious or badly designed. For the story, it's clichéd and groan-worthy.\n\nGames rehash things all the time, but can still be somewhat innovative or at least apply something in a somewhat new or original way. STASIS does none of these. It feels as though someone wanted to tell a short story about space science or had their own version of Dead Space, and decided to make a game out of it. The gameplay really feels like an afterthought, just something to move you from story sequence to story sequence.\n\n* Conclusion *\nIf you've read this, or seen videos/screenshots, and you're still interested, buy it. Definitely wait until there's a sale though.\n\nFor everyone else, don't bother. Maybe pick it up if it's undergoing an enormous sale.\n\nIf you want a good horror experience for this price, I recommend the following:\n\nResident Evil 0  - £15.99 (£3 Cheaper than STASIS)\nResident Evil 1 - £15.99 (£3 Cheaper than STASIS)\nOR\nI Have No Mouth and I Must Scream  - £4.79 (£14.20 Cheaper than STASIS)","February 26","false","13.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Frightening the audience to a calculated degree in a controlled medium is the way to achieve successful horror, and Stasis certainly isn't the first piece of media in the genre to fail at striking the proper balance. As a point and click adventure Stasis is essentially and interactive story. As a story it fails to be scary but instead comes off as cruel and cynical. Ultimately there isn't really any point to the story either, which leaves the player feeling like they just inundated his or herself with negativity for negativity's sake. That's the general feeling of the story in a nutshell. More specifically however there are some glaring issues. The story is predictable in that any plot twits or reveals are completely telegraphed as a direct result of being cliché retreads. Even the premise of the game serves as an immediate indication of this: Kidnapped while in stasis (because you can't fight back while in stasis you know....) only to wake up in a strange place that also happens to be creepy and gross. The game's few characters are totally one dimensional and are unable to add to the story any... dimension. Yep, makes sense. But hey if you like evil characters that are evil for the hell of it then this game's villain(s) should suit you just fine. On the other hand if you're just a fan of the sci-fi horror/thriller genre I recommend you pass up this concentrated laser beam of pointless bad feels and watch a good movie instead. Event Horizon, Pandorum, Sunshine, etc.... Any of those and many others will serve you better than this. Sorry if this all comes off as negative but you know what they say: Garbage in, garbage out  :P","December 1, 2015","false","9.1"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

It's not a terrible game, but it's difficult to whole-heartedly recommend. A little bit like the movie Pandorum at first, you wake up out of a stasis pod with only a few memories of who you are, and no idea why you're on board a seemingly abandoned spacecraft. The rest of the game involves solving puzzles and reading logbooks while trying to figure out what's going on and how to reunite with your family.\n\nPositives:\n+A genuinely creepy atmosphere, especially in the first half of the game.\n+ Good art direction.\n+ Mostly logical puzzles that involve using the ship's environments to advance.\n\nNegatives:\n- Simple animation and blurry, low resolution graphics.\n- Fairly short\n- Limited, so-so voice acting\n- Ships logs seem like they're all written by the same high school kid, and 90% of them involve the writer pining about getting laid with another crewmate before things go South\n- The plot goes from spooky to silly about halfway through the game, and gets worse from there. Without spoiling too much, the story is very derivative, borrowing bits and pieces from Pandorum and Bioshock, the Island of Doctor Moreau and even Fallout: New Vegas. And yet somehow, it ends up coming out as a bit of a mess by the time you're done.\n\nThere's some good things here, but also proof that the developers need some more experience before putting together a really great game. If you like really like point & click horror adventures, I'd advice getting this on a Steam Sale. For everyone else, maybe pass this one up.","April 4","false","6.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AL-97/recommended/380150/","AL-97","AL-97","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AL-97/","225 products in account","Managing expectations is important. Perhaps it was a mistake on my part to expect a story that works not only on a basic three act structure level, but also leaves room for arguing about a metaphor, detailed analysis and interpretation. Not that there is anything wrong with a more straightforward storytelling, especially if it's finely crafted, but the number of science fiction clichés that present in STASIS is just too large: Unethical Scientific Experiment gone wrong, Evil Megacorporation, Insane Over-Obsessed Scientist that just have to Play God because... clichés.\nI guess you can argue that this failed experiment can be interpreted as a metaphor for a stem cell controversy; evil scientist who violates medical ethics is a warning reminder of unethical human experimentation and that such sets of principles as the Nuremberg Code[en.wikipedia.org] and the Declaration of Helsinki[en.wikipedia.org] could not be violated; and Megacorporation is supposedly an anti-globalization statement. But for that assumption to be true, those topics should be actually developed and expanded upon. Instead they exist only to justify the horror setting and as a mechanism that propels protagonist from point A to B.\nIt's important to manage expectations, but it also important to look at things in a fair way. And it's hard to argue that for a small South African indie studio STASIS is a huge accomplishment. Crafted mainly by just two people this game boasts some pretty decent visuals, while also managing to lend several genuinely effective jump scares (in a point and click adventure game!) and have one pretty disturbing (think self surgery scene from Prometheus) scene. Game's puzzle logic isn't a completely detached one either, and puzzle logic is very important in an adventure game.\nI don't see myself replaying STASIS, and it certainly did not manage to leave any kind of significant aftertaste. But it's a first step, and a one which brothers Chris and Nic Bischoff (main creators of the game) should not be ashamed of. I just hope they will hire a proper scriptwriter for their new game.","September 9, 2015","false","9.9"," 7 of 17 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","7","17","0","1"

Not only are the graphics really well put together, the art direction is incredibly inspired too.\n\nSound\nThe voice acting has its ups and downs, but the rest of the sounds in this game are spot-on.\n\nDisturbing content\nAs this is a horror game, it's important that its horrorific elements hold up to disturb the audience, and that they do admirably. This game has plenty of unnervingly nauseating scenes, especially ones centered around body horror.\n\n- CONS:\n\nPlot and narration\nOne of the two biggest problems, this game's plot loses appeal really fast, and I believe the biggest factor in this is simply how it was told.\nDuring the game you'll have the assistance of a certain character, with whom you will occasionally expend a few words. And by that I mean, every five minutes you'll be rehearsing the upteenth variant of "I know this is horrible but you must go on".\nI'm no master of storytelling, but it seems to me that the best way to go about this kind of horror plot would be to leave the player alone to metabolize what's happening and take in the environment. I get that the writer probably wanted you to have some human interaction to contrast the horror of the situation, but I don't think the content and frequence of the conversations you have in this game benefit the atmosphere at all.\n\nA second form of storytelling is log entries in the countless PDAs scattered around the place. A decent narrative strategy, if not for the fact that:\n1) They're too verbose, mostly irrelevant to your present situation and the way they're written feels samey after a while.\n2) They decidedly outnumber the items you can pick up for puzzles while being more visible, which makes their presence a thorn in your side while you're trying to solve a puzzle.\n\nAs for the plot itself, if you know your sci-fi tropes you'll have it figured out in a matter of minutes. The problem is that 99% of the time the game consists in "find a way to get to X", so you tend to forget about what you did a minute ago since you've moved past to a different room.\n\nPuzzles and level design\nDespite having found a couple of interesting puzzles, the vast majority is just busywork. There's plenty of closed doors/hatches/lids that need something to open them, and not much else. This creates a further problem: since most of the time your objective is the same (open the path forward) you eventually lose your focus on anything that lies between you and the next door, and you end up not knowing what you're supposed to do exactly.\nOn top of this the game has a certain annoying tendency, especially early on, to pad the playable area with empty, useless rooms and corridors.\n\nInterface\nLetting a couple of glitches silide, the interface has a few problems too:\n- The cursor is too ambiguous. Most of the time the "eye" indicates something you can examine but not interact with (as in, not even use items upon), but occasionally you do. On the other hand, the "hand" pointer mostly indicates things you can either pick up or "use", but every now and then a spot will only be interactible by using an item on it.\n- No subtitles for anything that isn't a conversation between characters.\n- You can't skip text or cutscenes. Since in this game you can die you'll probably have to once or twice, which will make having to sit through the same empty dialogue again really frustrating.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAs far as the horror elements go, Stasis is exceptional. The problem is that most of everything else falls short: the dialogues and personal logs all blur together, the sci-fi elements are left extremely underdeveloped, and the puzzles only occasionally keep up your interest.\nAt a lower price it would probably be worth it  just to experience the incredible visuals and the atmosphere.","September 19, 2015","false","6.1"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

I bought the game as soon as it came out without any prior knowledge of it, I just thought it looked interesting. The liked the idea of a survival horror that was more about exploration and the atmosphere, and this game certainly had a lot of that. The setting is very familiar to the Alien franchise; it also reminded me of the film Event Horizon.\n\nTo get down to it, I'm struggling to decide whether to recommend this game. It's definitely good but it had some pitfalls that almost made me want to stop playing. I'll try and summarise the positives and negatives.\n\n--Pros--\n\n+Fantastic atmosphere. The sounds and designs of this ship are amazing. It starts off quite plain but then gets more creative and disturbing the further in you go. Occasionally you get flavour announcements over the tannoy or a horrific scream.\n+The story is compelling in that you wake up without any knowledge of what's happened and you uncover it all as you go. You learn the story mostly from reading logs from the crew members. Some of them are very personal and you can tell a lot of crew members were connected to one another as they mention each other in their logs.\n+The puzzles are challenging. It tests your way of thinking, sometimes you've got to think outside of the normal boundaries of what a game lets you do because this game might surprise you. So it's not an easy play through that you can finish in just a few hours.\n\n--Cons--\n\n-I had the game bug out on me a number of times. Sometimes I could end up walking over impassable terrain and not able to interact with anything anymore. When this happened all I could do was load up my last saved game. So I ended up having to save frequently to make sure I didn't lose a huge chunk of progress.\n-The click-to-move was frustrating. Sometimes it would take a weird path to get to where you wanted to go, which wouldn't be so bad if some levels didn't have deathtraps. One time i literally clicked on a box next to me and John would just walk into the middle of the room to get shot. Which then brings me to my next point..\n-Certain story events weren't skippable. When you reach a new area or something significant happens there's usually some dialogue, however if you die you may end up doing it again and again, it won't skip. This was particularly tedious when i was getting shot over and over and had to restart the whole dialogue sequence again. I ended up loading a save just to skip it.\n-Some of the puzzles are outright cruel. On more than one occasion I was completely stuck and was clicking everything I could. I had to consult a video walkthrough three seperate times because I was completely at wits end. The first one was in the first 15 minutes and when I found out what it was I couldn't believe how specific it was. Most of the time you would figure it out through clues in the area but other times there were no obvious signs and would take plenty of trial and error on anything remotely interactable.\n\n--Neutral--(Neither good nor bad, just things to be aware of)\n\n=The game is very gory, disturbing and unsettling. Although it's all taking place in an isometric view, it's still pretty gross. Some of the scenes towards the end, while I appreciated them I can imagine many may not.\n=There's a lot of reading. You don't have to read every entry on every PDA you see but that's really what the game is about, plus there are a number of clues to be found. You get a lot of background about the ship and the crew from reading the logs and emails but they are expansive.\n=The voice acting is okay, at least from the protagonist. But Te-ah...oh dear, Te-ah.\n\nTo conclude, I did get a positive experience from this game but there were a few shortcomings that frustrated me along the way. I was willing enough to see it through to the end as I wanted to know what happened. I have to lean towards not recommending it though. I would only recommend it if you're genuinely interested in a sci-fi horror story, and you enjoy point and click adventures enough to get over the awkward controls.\n\nI would rate this about 5/10 personally. If you can pick this up in a Halloween sale, go for it.","September 6, 2015","false","8.4"," 5 of 17 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","5","17","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/seanmolley/recommended/380150/","seanmolley","M. Sean Molley","http://steamcommunity.com/id/seanmolley/","411 products in account","Disclosure: I backed this game on Kickstarter, and I don't regret doing so -- the project delivered exactly what was promised, which already puts it ahead of many Kickstarters.  I can't recommend the game for the reasons below, but that doesn't mean that I think the creators failed, or that the game shouldn't have been made. It's a successful project that unfortunately produced a mediocre game.\n\nThe good: Many of the horror scenes, particularly those involving the physical/personal horror of terrible things happening to the main character's body, are effective.  Most of the puzzles are organic to the story (no cat-hair mustaches).  The graphics are fine overall (with one major issue; see below) and the pre-rendered cinematics are excellent. The sound design (excluding the voice acting) ranges from good to great -- the environmental effects in particular are disgustingly evocative. I don't think the game is too short (and it doesn't end in a cliffhanger, so thank you for that).\n\nThe bad: The graphics are too damn dark.  I am not bothered by the single fixed resolution available -- the level of detail and overall quality looked fine to me, even on a large monitor.  The problem is the gamma. There are too many scenes where you can't see important things, even with the brightness cranked all the way up.  I get that the designers were trying to make the game dark and atmospheric, but watching a dark unrecognizable shape navigate its way through dark unrecognizable corridors to pick up dark unrecognizable objects gets old.\n\nAlso, there is far too much pixel hunting for a game released in 2015.  That was maybe okay in earlier eras of adventure games, but there's absolutely no reason not to have a "hold down this key to see all the hotspots" option in a modern game. A few times this even extends to room exits being difficult to find, which is flat-out unacceptable.  I don't mind a hard game, I don't mind a game that kills the main character in a wide variety of arbitrary yet amusing ways, and I don't mind a game that refuses to hold your hand, but I do mind a game where I have to sweep the mouse over every inch of every screen in order to be able to proceed.\n\nOn the plus side, only a handful of the puzzles fall into the "guess what I'm thinking" category, and a few of them are quite clever.\n\nThe ugly: The story is mediocre at best,  and I don't mean "it grossed me out too much" or "it was campy but fun".  This game takes itself seriously ... which is unfortunate because nearly everything is badly written. While the game's attempts at physical horror mostly succeed, its attempts at psychological horror mostly fail.  The spoken dialogue ranges from awkward to awful (and the voice actors seem to have been encouraged to chew on the furniture, especially the "mad scientist" villain). The in-game PDAs (which are entirely optional) reveal the crew of the Groomlake to have been a bunch of stereotypical misfits who collectively manage to tick all the boxes on the master list of dysfunctional interpersonal relationships. Even the inevitable betrayal (I'd say "spoiler alert," but really, by now we all know that there has to be an inevitable betrayal in this style of game, right?) is justified by its perpetrator in a way that makes absolutely no sense.\n\nI really wanted to like this game -- and, as strange as it may sound, I don't regret backing it on Kickstarter, nor do I regret playing it. There are some geniunely horrifying moments in there mixed in amidst the overwrought dialogue and the cliches. In fact, there are just enough good things about Stasis to make me think that its creators might have a really good adventure game in them.  If there was a recommendation setting for "don't play this game, but I think you should buy it anyway, so its creators make enough money to try again" I'd pick that.  As it stands, I can't in good conscience endorse the game, because it has too many flaws to be a worthwhile investment of the 6-8 hours you'll spend finishing it.  But I don't hate it, and I genuinely hope that its creators will try again.  In fact, if they go back to Kickstarter for a new game, I'll back it. I sure hope they hire an editor for the script next time, though.\n\nFinal thoughts: There probably is a price point at which I could see my way clear to recommend Stasis, but not at $25 (which is the price as of this writing). If it drops to $10, which I'm sure it eventually will, any fan of adventure games will no doubt find something to like here. A small team made a game from scratch and that's an accomplishment worthy of respect.","September 7, 2015","false","8.6"," 3 of 13 people (23%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","23","3","13","0","0"

Sometimes I had to do things which I didn't understand the purpose of but simply did because they were the only thing possible to do. Reading all the logs (which I normally enjoy) got tedious in the end, because the log entries got longer and longer and were pretty repetitive. There wasn't really that much (surprising) story, so reading the logs didn't reveal much new after about the middle of the game. The villain was standard B-movie evil and the twist in the end was quite forseeable. Most annoying thing was that the voice acting wasn't consistant. I guess the recordings were made out of order because after your character suffers the most terrible experience of all (quite close to the end) and appears totally broken, he chats with the same tone and attitude as before like 5 minutes later. That really destroyed the atmosphere for me.\nSo I have to say that while I am a sucker for sci-fi and appreciate the effort put into this, I still can only give it 4/10.","September 6, 2015","false","7.4"," 8 of 24 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","8","24","0","0"

No? That's okay, STASIS reminds you how deep and compelling they were. Dismissing this game for it's prerenders and/or it's static viewpoint is a huge mistake, especially if one is into a beautifully crafted story with generous helpings of lore and background to go around.\n\nSTASIS starts out much like any other sci-fi horror game: player wakes up in a scene somewhere between the cryogenic thaw scenes of Demolition Man and the gore-tastic parts of Event Horizon (one of which you should watch if you like sci-fi horror, the other if you're a fan of "did anyone read the script before argreeing to this" horror). From there the game follows some tropes (oh, all these logs mention not going to this place... guess where I'm headed) but manages to keep a steady pace to maintain interest. Some of the puzzles can be a bit of a pain to get through but luckily there are generous hints not only in the logs but 'on' them as well (when you see it for the first time you'll get it). Unfortunately, there are some typical "oh, those things have to be combined, strange" moments (let's face it, it's a staple of point-and-click adventure games) but aside from those and some story tropes the game is definately worth a few playthroughs (once to get to the end, once to find all the ways to die because achievements, and once to try to figure out what the heck happened at that part).","September 4, 2015","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Environment sound is well-done as the overall atmosphere. Sometimes the writing (especially in dialogues) is a bit bland but ok in summary.\n\nI recommend it to people that like adventure games with a more sinister premise.

It's a sci fi horror, so think Dead Space Event Horizon ran by Weyland-Yutani wrapped up and served as Sanitarium. Quite nice if you go for that creepy disgusting wtf-is-this feeling.\n\nYou, John Marachek, go to stasis induced sleep next to your family only to wake up, quite brutally, on a completely alien ship next to some unknown, and also dead, people. You travel through the empty innards of that ship to find your family and uncover the horrifying secrets of Weyland-Yutani, erm, I mean Cayne Corporation.\n\nVISUALS\nFirst thing first, forget about your fancy gfx settings. Actually forget about any gfx settings as there are none. Well, you can change brightness, but other than that you cannot even change the resolution. Fortunately, the lack of settings doesn't mean that the game looks bad. Apart from the often stiff animations everything looks positively creepy with spaceship interiors splattered with blood here and mysterious research facility of unspeakable horrors there.\n\nAUDIO\nMusic and sound effects are fitting for most part, but there are a few places where music becomes might annoying. Fortunately these are few and far between. More often than not the audio is adding that additional layer of creepiness with occassional cackling pipes, distant scream or mutant roar.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nIs basically what you could expect from a point and click adventure game. Most of the time you are either pointing or clicking. The story is not the greatest ever told, but it is solid and has a few twists. It is mostly told by the discarded PDA and log entries, so some reading is involved. The puzzles are rather logical and can be solved by, less or more creative, thinking rather by using everyt item on everything. It took me 8hrs to finish, with reading all the PDA entries and paying some attention to environment and without being very much stuck anywhere.\n\nRecommended for fans of The Fall, Event Horizon, and anyone who thinks point and click Dead Space could be fun.\n\nSTASIS Random Game Footage : http://youtu.be/PvjOjBBfVQY","September 3, 2015","true","13.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The sci-fi horror setting was well done. However, it is not a scary game. A lot of the puzzles were really easy and only a small handfull were any trouble at all. The story was just ok. It was a downer. The worst thing I can say about Stasis is that it didn't leave any emotional imprint on me one way or another. It's an utterly forgettable title, but the 11 hours it took to beat the game were moderately fun.","December 30, 2015","true","11.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I recently finished playing through STASIS...for the first time. I say this because I will be doing it again! I fell in love with STASIS with the very first alpha demo that was released as part of it's Kickstarter campaign. It was fantastic to see it go from that early stage to it's fully fleshed out state.\n\nEverything about this game sucks you in. The atmosphere and ambient sounds really got me immersed into the "world" of the game, and really reminded me of such things as the original Alien film. The voice acting is excellent, especially that of Ryan Cooper who plays the main character, John Maracheck - his performance and delivery really drew me into the emotion of the character.\n\nI'll admit it's not 100% perfect, but really this is only down to some of the animations being slightly off sometimes. But when you consider this was a game made by two brothers, on their own, and despite these little things you don't ever feel taken out of the game. Nor did I find anything ruined the game. No real spoilers but in case: the ending wasn't what I was expecting - I wasn't disappointed with it, but I did get a little thrown off.\n\nI did, in fact, cover this game as a series on my YouTube channel, and if anyone would like to check it out then follow the link below to the playlist. Otherwise just go ahead and buy this game - you won't be disappointed!\nSTASIS playlist - efwaGames","May 27","true","9.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story within this game is that of a man who woke up on a ship in ♥♥♥♥ all nowhere within one of the ice giants in the jovian area of the solar system. The art style of the game is both dark and creepy. Many people will assume that the game will be scary, and those that do, will be seriously disappoint. This game follows more on the concept of what is disturbing. The story has very clearly disturbing moments that can ♥♥♥♥ with a person's head when they think about it. It is not the standard horror, it is a thriller based story game. If you look at it through that point; everything is fine. In all honesty it follows concept well. The original "The Fly," the one without the gore had some in audiences scared with the disturbing imagery that most millennials will laugh at. But the thought, and seeing something so horrible can make a person uncomfortable. Maybe even feel the fear that follows the character, but not you; as I said thriller, not horror.","May 28","true","72.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The puzzle logic is great, I found myself relying more on paying attention to the environment and the journal entries and less about randomly placing two objects together. The story is a little disappointing, basically being the standard of the genre where scientists are doing unethical stuff and everything goes wrong. But it's a decently told rendition of that old song and dance.\n\nIf you're a fan of the genres involved you could do worse.
