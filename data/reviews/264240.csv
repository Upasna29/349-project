Took me about 17 hours and it turned out to be one of those games that keep me awake until 10 in the morning.\n\nIt feels and plays like your own personal interactive Star Trek episode. It is your classic "Thriller on the Express" with a strange murder, a killer hiding amongst your crew, an ancient conspiracy, aliens, mercenaries, and a whole load of mystery. In my first playthrough I have failed to reveal a culprit, but thanks to the fact that the game has a lot of replay value, I will delve into it again in the hopes of solving the case and do things differently.\n\nIt's got tons of character interactions (Which you are free to befriend, antagonize or completely ignore), pages upon pages of lore and exposition in the Zenlil's onboard library (Which you can totally avoid if you don't like reading), choices that actually matter and a few twists and turns that I honestly did not see coming (And a couple that I totally did).\n\nThe player is encouraged by the game to explore alternative routes as much as possible. One can reload an auto-save made before a conversation (The game saves into a separate slot every few minutes automatically) and choose a different option if you are dissatisfied with a result. You don't have to, but you can if you so desire.\n\nAside from rather long loading times, a couple graphical glitches and small progression issues such as characters sometimes responding as if I walked away from a conversation when I didn't (Both fixed by loading a previous save), it was a pretty smooth ride.\n\nThis is probably not the game for you if you enjoy fast paced shooters (Although it does have some FPS elements), but if you think you might enjoy an adventure/RPG/quest mix then give it a go.\n","September 19, 2015","true","45.6"," 174 of 199 people (87%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","87","174","199","14","3"

The interaction between player and A.I. seems so natural and realistic, and the voice acting is seriously one of the best I've seen, better than most big budget games. There's a lot of variety in dialogue choices, which actually make a big difference in the outcome(s). I encourage all to play multiple times, you will discover a lot of different things. You will encounter events and situations if you're at the right spot at the right time (some quite humorous), making it seem like a real living world. The story is definitely its other strong point, with plenty of background lore to discover if that is your thing - or otherwise you can be just as engrossed without the deeper knowledge. Graphics are unique, good textures, nicely detailed areas, minor graphical glitches, nothing game breaking. I haven't done much combat, as I prefer the diplomatic options, but from what I have experienced there's nothing wrong with it.\n\nAll in all, it's fantastic on so many levels, and I wait in anticipation for the next installment.\n\nIT'S A ROLEPLAYERS DREAM COME TRUE!","January 5, 2014","true","16.2"," 263 of 328 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","263","328","0","19"

It isn't ruined by poor interaction, bugs or bad gameplay and the likes. It's ruined by the fact that this whole thing is gaming blue balls; a shareware demo; a teaser. There is a plethora of fantastic game content that you ultimately don't get to play with. The combat/inventory system is barely utilized outwith the VR trainer sim. The story is a gigantic cliff-hanger. You're encouraged to use quicksaves to explore alternate dialogue options, but they will only leave you with more questions. Very few will provide the answers you crave more and more as you explore further. The game literally ends when you jump out the back of the futuristic jumbo-jet you start the game in - imagine if the whole of Mass Effect was set on the Normandy and that's about what this title is. If you explore the dialogue and lore (of which there is a near-overwhelming amount of), you'll get some good hours from this game. However, this release is basically a glorified "Murder on the Orient Express" game - or the first half of one anyway. You're going to have to wait a whole lot longer for any closure, and, of course, put down some more cash. A wholly unfulfilling and, in the end, frustrating experience.","January 26, 2015","false","11.9"," 173 of 213 people (81%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","81","173","213","7","6"

Trying to get KOTOR to work on my computer and failing miserably. I go to the store with $20 in my Steam wallet. Fed up and tired to pick an indie game that looked interesting.\n\nI run into CONSORTIUM.\n\nI decide ah, what the hell and buy it. To my surprise, it actually turned out to be a great game.\n\nThe story goes as follows: You are you. The game itself is actually a portal to an alternate reality's future where you inhabit the body of a man codenamed "Bishop - 6" a high ranking officer in the CONSORTIUM. That's all the game tells you about the character (at least in the time I played it) The game physically cannot let you know about Bishop's past, as it glitches out when people talk about it. The characters and the writing are better than a lot of triple-a titles out there and can be very humorous at times.\n\nThe music is beautiful, it sounds like it could go in KOTOR itself, and there is a reason for that: Jeremy Soule composed this game's soundtrack. As an admirer of his work I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nOther than a few minor bugs, the CONSORTIUM is a fantastic experience in my honest opinion.\n\nCheck this game out!

It's also a pretty short game; I finished it twice in about 11 hours.\n\nWith that said, this game is worth playing twice if you enjoy this type of game. What type is that? An RPG with lots of decisions and consequences. Note that, the decisions you make are actually quite impactful, and the game entirely allows you to make "bad" decisions (the game itself describes this as there being no bad decisions). Beyond that, the game explores some fairly cool science fiction themes and does a fairly good job in making those themes interesting and plausible.\n\nJust a small addendum: I said this game is largely based around decisions and consequences. Let me elaborate on this a little. During the game you'll be trying to solve a sort of mystery. You will not be spoon-fed the answers to your questions and your suspicions will not easily be confirmed. Even if you do a pretty thorough job of the 'investigation', there's a good chance you won't figure it out. However: That is okay. If you don't figure it out the game doesn't become less fun after that point.\n\nI would absolutely recommend this game, with one sidenote: This is a short game. If you think a game costing 15 euro or dollar or whatever, should net you ~15+ hours of gameplay, then you should buy this game when it's on sale. I myself bought it at 65% off, but feel like I wouldn't have been upset if I'd bought it at full price.","July 11, 2015","true","10.9"," 64 of 71 people (90%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","90","64","71","4","0"

Lets ignore the game breaking bugs and the fact that most people seem incapable of finishing the game. Lets ignore the peculiar graphics choices since they're functional and graphics arent important as long as they perform all the tasks you need them to in the game.\n\nHere be spoilers.\n\nThis entire 'game' is the intro sequence to a game they havent made yet! You're told bishops are essentially a warrior class, you're given a powerful suit of armour, several weapons and several pieces of equipment that you plug into your armour for various effects...and there is no combat in the game. The combat takes place in a virtual reality suite, there is one opportunity for actual physical combat in the game and it only happens if you screw everything up. Also, the special equipment you get for plugging into your suit that gives you different abilities? that is only given to you AS THE GAME ENDS! Meaning they put work into coding items you are physically incapable of using in the game at any point. They constantly talk about the combat system, the equipment system, your role as a warrior in this alternate society...and before you actually engage in any combat the game ends. This game would have been perfectly fine as an interactive story game. If they had included none of the taunting allusions to combat, none of the equipment and several guns you will never use in any situation (they're even locked down during the game with the safety on, I never even fired them) and focused on the one thing the game delivers, a good narrative and great voice acting, it would have been a good game. But constantly promising that this is a first person shooter with role playing aspects when it is in fact a socialization simulator is misleading and a direct attempt to lull in a different audience.\n\nIn short it's 2014 and having a dialogue tree in a game is not a selling point, we've had those functioning at this level since the 90s. You cant sell a game entirely on the point it has a dialogue tree in it, so they clumsily tacked on some pretend first person shooter aspects to use guns to sell it. The entire 'game' is a sham. It's an interactive movie, which would be fine if they marketed it that way. Including features it isnt possible to use anywhere in the 'game' whilst constantly leading you to believe the game is a first person shooter in the advertising and in the game itself is dishonest and frankly insulting.","January 10, 2014","false","6.7"," 106 of 144 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","106","144","0","7"

No its not like Mass Effect.\n\nI bought this the minute I saw it on Steam. Why? It looked cool and the story/setting got me intrigued.\nThe first hour was a bumpy ride because of a wide variety of bugs. The devs were very honest about it, admitted they should have released it as an early access game.\nI waited, patiently, a few weeks for the devs to fix their game. I started over because the patch also deleted the savegames (which was announced by the devs as well).\n\nThis whole game takes place on a rather small spaceship and you're a Bishop, lead operations if I'm correct.\nThe ships hierarchy is based on chess. You have your pawns, rook, queen, king, etc.  So you always know the status of a crewmember.\nYou're transfered from 2014 into this bishop person. At the start you have no idea who you are and what you're supposed to do. You'll learn by interacting with the people on board, who do not know you're from 2014 (and you might want to keep it that way). The way you respond to these people and actions you take playing this game will get different outcomes. In my 5 hours playthrough I somehow managed to ♥♥♥♥ of most of my crewmembers ;)\nI checked the achievements and there are a lot of ways to finish this game. I'm thinking about playing it again, with some different approaches to some situations.\n\nThe story begins with a hostile attack and a murder and unfolds after that. I liked the story, a lot! More games/episodes are coming as this story ends with a cliffhanger. I'm looking forward to it!\n(I cant tell more about the story without giving away too much.)\n\nSome points you might find interesting:\n\n* FPS\nJust a small part though this might be more important in the coming games. You have a wide arsenal of weapons, all with different specs. You have guns to kill and guns to capture. Whatever you choose will ofcourse change the outcome.\nI had 2 battles in this game and 1 tutorial. It aint CSGO or COD but its ok.\n* Graphics\nlooking good but nothing fancy, kinda like an interactive comic. Not childish in any way though.\n* Sound\nVoiceacting is great. Lot of different accents, all very convincing.\nSoundtrack and effects are ok.\n* Replayability\nDefinately! I checked the achievements after completing this and I saw their are many different outcomes to specific situations.\n\nOverall\nExcellent game and I have no regrets buying this. The 6-man dev team did a great job and reacted honest and adequate when they found out people were experiencing bugs.  The story, for me the most important part, is great and well told.

This isn’t a typical RPG though.  There are no levels or experience points.  The game isn’t designed around the combat, skills, or even the relationships.  It’s designed around the personalities of the characters.  The joy of this game comes from the fun visuals and most importantly the diverse and talented voice actors.  The dialog is something to be savored rather than skipped though.  The voice talent and fun visuals made me really fall for this game but I can’t fully recommend it yet.  If you buy Consortium you will love it eventually but the game had several very frustrating bugs and I spent more than 2 hours finding a work around for one.  Once the developers work this out the game will be great.  Buy this game now if you love deep backstory, plot, and character development.  Buy this game next month if you just like RPGs.\n","January 9, 2014","true","5.0"," 72 of 93 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","72","93","0","1"

In my frustration i wrote a negative review because of its near unplayable state.\n\nInterdimensional Studios themselves admited ( and apologized ) that "Consortium's" launch was horribly buggy and thankfully this is no longer the case. With all their hard work and dedication to the project all bugs (game-breaking or just weird) are now gone.\n\nI intended on fully editing this review if the problems were solved and now they have.\n\nI can best describe 'Consortium' as a mix of the original Star Trek and Mass Effect with the shooting mechanics and engine of Half Life 2 and if that mix doesn't sound good to you ( or you didn't like any of these examples ) then it's hard to recommend. However if you're looking for epic 1st person sci-fi romp with an emphasis on story, dialogue, player choice story and wrapped up with some decent shooting mechanics look no further.\n\n'Consortium' is also the first in a trilogy and only lasts about 10 hours at the most, however it never feels "too short" and i'm very excited for what's to come. The story is brilliantly written, the game has marvelous presentation and the characters throughout the adventure are interesting and their dialogue throughout it is well done. Combat is a bit like an old school shooter mixed with Half-Life 2 (which i find works well enough) but it's hardly the focus of the game.\n\nNo, the focus of 'Consortium' is the interactions between you and the other crew aboard the ship with multiple dialogue choices and the dire consequences for most of them, and Interdermentional studios have done it brilliantly. Even with my previous frustration at launch it's obvious how far 'Consortium' has come and the Master Edition truly is worth anyone's time especially for only $20.\n\nThis is the type of game i've been wanting ever since Mass Effect came out, and it certainly doesn't disappoint.","January 8, 2014","true","4.6"," 99 of 139 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","99","139","0","8"

These choices have a significant impact in how things play out and what scenarios you are put in. Something that is very lacking in today's modern games. Too many games claim to give you freedom of choice however many of these games lead you to the exact same place/story segment and it feels cheap. Consortium however is different, decisions you make in the beginning of the game can adversely affect you later on without you knowing it. I have played through this game a few times now and I am very impressed with the degree of how the decisions you make have a major impact on what goes on.\n\n+ Its one thing to have choices, but if the scenarios are boring the game wouldn't be interesting. Consortium does a great job of putting you in some really great situations. These situations will really make you think and the outcomes are not always so obvious.\n\n+ The developers really wanted to explain everything in the game. The game features an in-game console that explains a lot of the history /characters/story to really immerse you in the game. In addition all the characters seem to act realistically given their surroundings. It wasn't until I went online and read what other people were seeing that it made me go back into the game to see how much attention to detail the developers put into such a small game.\n\n+Good replay value, play the game again and choose different options, speak to people differently and see what happens!\n\n+ Good voice acting\n\n+ I was very surprised by how good the music is.\n\n+ Included is a virtual reality mini game, it is completely optional and provides a nice change of pace to a game that is mostly about talking to people.\n\nThe Average:\n\nThe developers included partial controller support, sadly the controller doesn't seem to work in menus/inventory making controller support rather useless. You are given two choices of button layouts, you cannot remap any buttons for the controller. Just stick with keyboard/mouse.\n\nThe art style is rather ugly. It just doesn't look right, the game isn't very impressive technically either. I understand this is an independent developer and they don't have a big budget but that doesn't really excuse them for choosing such a poor art style.\n\nUser interface looks cheap.\n\nMost of the back story is hidden behind information console.\n\nSomewhat short if you don't bother to read anything in the information console.\n\nThe Bad\n\nIn a game that is all about making choices and replaying the game to see how things play out differently, it would be nice to skip dialogue. Having to listen to the same things over and over again is awful.\n\nConclusion\nI really want the is game to do well because the game has some really good design decision wrapped up in a poor looking presentation.","February 8, 2015","true","14.9"," 32 of 38 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","32","38","0","1"

A very promising game, but there are issues.  The game runs terribly, I've got every setting turned down to "low" or "off" and I've still got framerate issues.  I'm no graphics ♥♥♥♥♥, but it would be nice if the game at least ran smoothly.  It's keeping me from getting immersed into the story.  However the devs claim to be working on a patch, and I'll take their word on that for the time being\n\nThe combat seems lacking, but I didn't buy this game for combat and I'm more interested in taking the non-lethal route anyway.\n\nDialogue/writing.  I'm VERY early in the game yet, but this ain't no Mass Effect 1 & 2 (we shall never speak of 3) but it is passable, and the characters seem likable enough so far (though the doc is either poorly acted or intentionally creepy, I won't be shocked if that's a plot point)\n\nSTILL, this game seems interesting, and I'd rather be playing this than a Call of Duty, or a Bioshock clone, or whatever else is "new" that I've already played 4,000 times before, so I'm going to give it a tenative recommend.","January 9, 2014","true","5.7"," 25 of 31 people (81%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","81","25","31","3","3"

(Forgetting about the fact I've been waiting for a sequel for AGES)\nToo many games are forgettable in my opinion.  Especially when Steam has SO MANY.  This one however, was totally worth it ;)\n\nLet's skip to the breakdown:\n+ Great background music by Jeremy Soule and free soundtrack download\n+ Stanley's Parable level of unique choices with different outcomes\n+ Unique setting (it's on a plane?)\n+ Great voiced characters\n+ Detailed story with lively characters\n+ Did I mention the story?\n\n- The graphical style is unusual.  It's not BAD, it just doesn't look real\n- Fights while few, are fast, frantic and unwieldy\n- I ran into some weird graphical issues when I first played, restarting worked for me\n- A single playthrough is SHORT!  And the sequel, well I've been waiting forever!!\n\n+ The sequel is about to make its kickstart debut... FINALLY!\n\nThe real fun of this game is in blindly throwing yourself into a detailed new universe, the game admitting that, and enjoying how the world reacts to your choices.\n\nSpoiler example:\nWhat would happen if you started a new game, and didn't know much about your environment, who the NPCs were, ... even what your name was?  lol Actually that's typical, but expect this game to call you out on it if you're obvious.\n\nI recently played Undertale and it reminded of this game, choice-wise.  That's praise.\n\nAnyway, I say it's definitely worth a shot if it sounds at all interesting to you.  With TallTale taking the lead on games like this, it's nice to have new blood.

As soon as I'm done, I want to start the game again and try different things. This game is incredibly successful at engaging a lot more of my brain and 'gut feelings' than most. I'm not sure that I've ever played a game that gave the player such respect while also commanding so much responsibility.\n\nWithout revealing too much; you're thrown (somewhat 'naked') into a key role during a specific series of events. Your decisions and actions can sway how events unfold and also how the game is to be played. In most games, if you stray too far from what they want to show you, the game tugs harshly at your leash or essentially shuts down and waits for you to come back. Not so, here! As far as I can tell, the only time you're really yanked out of the proceedings is if your character dies. Then, you can load up an auto-save from earlier and try something else. That's only happened to me once so far. Basically, if you bumble, the game unfolds in a logical way as it would if someone in your position bumbled in an actual situation like this, if that makes sense.\n\nWhat kind of a game is it? Well, it's a shooter if you want it to be...I guess. It's a missile defense game sometimes. It's a 'cool special agent on a plane' social simulator. It's an alternate future reality quantum leap homage thingiemadoop.","January 1, 2015","true","3.1"," 23 of 28 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","23","28","0","0"

When originally released, it was filled with game-breaking bugs. Now, after many patches, it has some minor bugs, occasional graphical glitches, and rare crashes remaining, but for the most part it works. However the game is only 3 hours long and the replayability isn't all that great. You may profitably replay it once, or maybe twice. And it isn't a complete game; very few of the story elements are really resolved by the time you get to the end. It just tells you to buy the next game. The game is so short in fact that you get to the mission briefing for your first mission about 15 minutes before the end of the game, and you never get to play that mission. Apparently your first mission as a Bishop is in a sequel that may or may not ever be released.\n\nSome people say the game is ugly, but I find the graphics to be stylish. The voice acting is mostly good.\n\nIn short, it's kind of fun to talk to people, but it's a complete rip-off at $20 for 3 hours of gameplay that result in nothing really being resolved. If you can get it for $5 or less, go for it. Otherwise, I can't recommend this game.","July 9, 2014","false","5.6"," 63 of 100 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","63","100","0","11"

The game is somewhat unique in the fact that the world itself from what I've played continues through time like it's an actual world, now I have only played through it once so I don't know if it actually does that but it does it enough to feel alive. It's inspired by various sources but I'd say what has it inspired the most is probably choose your own adventure books, moreso then a particular game. Yes you can say Mass Effect, Yes you can say Deus Ex but a lot of these games while much longer don't quite encapture the amount of stuff you can actually do to affect the game's world the way Consortium does.\n\nAs much as I personally love this game, if you're looking for your typical action RPG this, unfortunately for you is not it, and by the end you may end up feeling like you bought a preview for what's to come as it's a trilogy that will yes, have a continual storyline. So for folks that are looking for a bit more meat I'd pass for now, check on the sequel when it comes out and buy both.

You are perfectly capable of shooting your way through the game as well, and both are viable ways to solve problems.\n\nTo complement all of this is a large cast of complex characters. I found myself reloading saves just because I was interested in exploring more dialogue options. The world of Consortium feels very alive and complex, hell, there's an in-game database that has an absolutely vast amount of backstory and supplementary material that you could spend a day reading.\n\nIf you've played the Mass Effect games, there's a strong chance you'll enjoy this game.

However, I managed to play through the game and fighting only once.  That is a rare thing, a RPG which actually let you forge a path, so far i beleive there are not that many opportunities to fight (this is episode 1, the others promise more action i think but thats speculation, there's also computer simulations for more action if needed). Although there was not much action, the storytelling was exelent. You actually get invested with the people you meet and the action you take. The characters you interact with also have a 'beyond highschool' mindset, and will speak about various things/subject (aka they do more than flirt with each others and reference the same poppular things). For instance a character is an addict to an online MMO and spen most of her time playing it. If confronted about that, other character may tell their opinion but not get invested too much as they are busy at that time. I had fun and will definitely at least replay once. I would say that the game is possibly closer to a visual novel than a full fledged action game, for part 1 at least. This does not take away from the experience, luckily.

However, even if I'd set my expectations sky high, I don't think this game would have disappointed me.\n\nFirst off, the game is rather pretty; the cel shaded graphics will likely help the game retain playability for a long time, so if you don't have the money to spend now, you can always wait for the next sale. Bonus: The developers have said there will be future episodes of Consortium that build upon the events of this game, so waiting for that may be in your best interest if you're a binge gamer.\n\nAs for the story, it feels pretty natural. If you're unfamiliar, the game puts you in the body of a person in the future. The game itself pretends that this is actually happening, so when you have to pretend you know what is going on, it feels legitimate. However, that also means that on future playthroughs, you can react to situations differently as you are more familiar with the game's lore. The game is built with this concept in mind, which makes it extremely replayable. On that note, I recommend playing the game through, living with each decision you make, rather than reloading to see how consequences change. In the amount of time I spent watching the loading screen, I probably could have played the game through at least one or possibly two more times.\n\nThe situtations the game puts you in have the feel of action-packed, suspensful movie scenes, and the game does a darned good job making you feel as if you were really in the thick of things. Also, since you're not the captain, you're not always the center of attention. In my opinion, this feeling adds another layer of deptht to the game as it made me feel more like a part of the crew, as opposed to having me order people around, Kirk-style.\n\nI can't speak much for the combat because the game gives you the options to not have to fight, except for one "air combat" mission. The controls in general felt solid. There's nothing that felt innovative here, but nothing that felt broken.\n\nThe only time the game didn't feel smooth were when I accidentally triggered an event that moved the story forward before I meant to. This is a chronic issue I have in games and may speak more about me than it does about the game.\n\nBottom Line/TL;DR: If you want to feel like you're actually in a futuristic crew on a ship flying around on missions, then this game is likely to be right up your alley. The conversation choices and reactions to actions you take feel natural and make you feel like you really are hijacking the body of someone in the future.","January 5, 2015","true","7.8"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","3"

Players were outraged because the game offered them a glimpse of something truly awesome and then snatched it away, right as the game came to an end. To be fair to the trilogy, what players felt they deserved was something most a games don't even try to provide: a true sense of player agency.\n\nThere's an obvious reason why giving players non-trivial choices is so rare. It's super hard. Every time a player makes a meaningful choice, the developer has to create all of the content for the path they chose and all of the content for the path they might not ever experience. The amount of content that needs to be written is literally exponential to the amount of content that the player experiences.\n\nCONSORTIUM ambitiously tries to meet this goal and it actually mostly succeeds. The most common complaint is that it's short. Of course it's short. It has to be. For every chunk of the game that you see, the devs had to make many that you don't. This branched story structure is essential for creating the kind of fun anxiety that comes from making real choices with incomplete information. The tradeoff is that you're paying for a lot of content that you'll never see.\n\nThe developers have tried to address this issue by making the game highly re-playable. Not only can you return to saved games to check out different paths, some elements of the game are actually different on different playthroughs. This solution sort of works, but the bulk of the dialogue never changes so replays can feel pretty tedious. The repetitiveness feels especially punishing when you have to re-load a game due to finicky dialogue and quest triggers. The game shipped with a ton of bugs, many of which are now fixed, but the triggers still require some babysitting.\n\nOverall, it's an ambitious game and a worthwhile experience. I'll definitely check out the sequel.\n\nOne final thought: CONSORTIUM advertized a large library of in-game text to read. It's theoretically optional, but there is information in there that can affect your game. Another important thing to know about it is that it's extremely boring. As much fun as I had playing the game, the world outside the aircraft is not particularly compelling.","January 21, 2014","true","26.5"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","1"

If you've ever played Deus Ex or Mass Effect and loved the dialogue options but been disappointed that it wasn't more in depth, this is the game for you. I have already played this game through three times and I'm still discovering things I missed in previous playthroughs.\n\nIn summary, a brilliant experience for the kind of person who really likes to delve into the backstory of different universes as well as experiment with dialogue and decision trees.","February 1, 2014","true","11.3"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

There's enough exposition to allow you to understand the ship and the world's current situation, but there remains the uneasy feeling that, being a traveller from another dimension, you really are out of your depth, and learning more is key to getting a grip on what's going on.\n\nThe voice acting is very good, and the usual tropes are avoided in the cast of well-rounded, interesting characters. A special mention must also be given to the soundtrack, which heightens tension in all the right places. "Almost as good as Morrowind's OST," I mused, before I closed the game and discovered it was Jeremy Soule himself who composed Consortium's score. Excellent selection, developers; I'll be buying the soundtrack shortly!\n\nThe gunplay, admittedly, feels a little janky, and the inventory menu was confusing in my opinion. This gave me the incentive to avoid fights and settle problems using diplomacy and cunning - I think this ended up being the better choice, but if combat is mandatory in the second game as I reckon it will be, I hope the HUD improves. However, it wasn't a major concern for me.\n\nAll in all, I'm really looking forward to the next installment of this. The developers of this game have created something brilliant - I hate to make comparisons, but I can't help but draw a parallel between this and the story-driven TellTalle games of recent years. If you like those, you will LOVE Consortium.\n\nNow, I have some mysteries to solve...","December 19, 2014","true","6.8"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Well first off I will say that I really enjoyed the play throughs I have made so far.\n\nConsortium puts you - Quantum Leap style - in the body of an operative called Bishop-6 onboard a high tech aircraft flying to Dublin. The entire game takes place during the flight and can play out differently every time depending on your actions. There are no right or wrong actions, just different versions of reality. You are confronted with a number of plots to solve - or ignore - which I won't spoiler. What I will say is that they are excellent, and enjoyable.\n\nConsortium is an excellent example of the "One Block RPG" where everything takes place in a small area with well developed characters but within that scope the player has great freedom. Consortium benefits from many play throughs as you explore diferent possibilities and in fact the game makes a virtue of this and saves them as detailed versions for you to look back on.\n\nOh did I mention it has a soundtrack by Jeremy Soule?\n\nThe game had a rough launch - the team who developed it are very small - but they stuck with ut  and turned it into a gem that should not be missed.\n\nIf you like good, thoughtful RPGs: buy it. If you love interesting sci-fi setups: buy it. If you like good writing: buy it, If you like soundtracks by Jeremy Soule: buy it.\n\nI'm going to go and have another playthrough now.","December 30, 2014","true","6.6"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","2"

I'm going to say this flat out, I cannot recommend this game to everyone, and a part of me still regrets spending the $20 I had on it. That being said, this isn't a bad game, but it also is not a very good one. Consortium suffers from a wide array of issues, but even with all of them, I cannot say I did not enjoy my time spent with it, it just honestly feels incomplete. It is a very different RPG experience you will not get from a lot of other games, but it has so many issues its hard to say whether or not they justify it's good points.\n\nConsortium is a FPS and also a Sci-Fi RPG. You play as a person living in the 20th century who uses a device to travel to the future of a parallel universe. You awake onboard a space ship with the task of simply living in this world. The ship is fairly small and leaves little to be explored, but all the characters on this ship are interesting for various reasons. Some people are average workers with a good personality, while some are just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, and even one is a religious extremist. If you are into games with a heavy focus on dialogue, you might be interested in this title, the problem is that most of the said dialogue includes details of the people onboard, and not on the world you are living in. This can be a huge let down for people, as you spend most of your play time learning about people, with no depth for anything else. However, even with the lacking explanation of the world, the dialogue is pretty damn good, and almost every voice actor plays their character perfectly, it honestly is some of the best voice acting I've seen in a game, which is really impressive for such a low budget title.\n\nWhen you aren't walking around, talking, and making decisions ( which actually do have a large impact on the gameplay, and really encourages multiple playthroughs ) you are fighting... MAYBE. This I feel is one of the strongest aspects of the game, you are given the decision of lethal or non-lethal combat, or skipping combat entirely. You will be placed in a situation where combat is about to happen, but if you make the correct decisions in the dialogue trees, you can talk your way out of it. This is something rarely even seen in a game, and it really is refreshing to see it here. That being said, violence is definitely an option, and if you don't want to talk your way out of something, opening fire on anything that lies in your way is an option, which really is the best part about this game, options. You are constantly deciding things, how to interact with other people, how you are going to deal with enemies, its all dependent on what YOU want to do, which is something that should be present in other RPGs.\n\nBut even with all of these good things the game offers, it has a lot of problems that are persistent throughout your whole play through. The game, while having an interesting and colorful art style, is ugly and outdated. Its not really a problem for me, and may not be for others, but it really is an absolute fact. The game is buggy, you can get stuck in walls, characters will fade through door ways, dialogue choices may disappear which will cause a reload, it really is a mess. Apparently it is not as bad as before, but it still is a huge issue. The inventory management is annoying, it uses an "energy" system. You hold energy to heal and repair armor, and also use the non-lethal weapon. Energy takes up inventory space, which means carrying even 50% energy will really limit your choices of weaponry and items. Everything is just too heavy, and I can see this being an issue in the sequels if more combat takes place. Yes combat doesn't take up that much of the game, but I still feel it is an issue. I think worst of all is how short the game is, I finished it in about 4 hours. Granted, I skipped the like 3 side quests, mainly because I couldn't figure out what to do for some of them. Yes, it has high replayability, and it is a great experience, but the price of $20 honestly leaves a bad taste in my mouth.\n\nIf you want to play a game that has a huge focus on dialogue and choices, and don't mind how short it is, this game is something you should look at, even people who are looking this style of gameplay may or may not enjoy this experience, so just be cautious. If you are willing to spend $20 on a risk, or it goes on sale, go for it. Otherwise, you're probably better of skipping it.\n","March 20, 2014","false","4.2"," 17 of 29 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","17","29","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/abedsbrother/recommended/264240/","abedsbrother","AbedsBrother","http://steamcommunity.com/id/abedsbrother/","525 products in account","Consortium is a short, dialogue-driven indie drama defined by the choices you make. Short, because its length feels like an episode rather than a full game (took me four hours to complete a run-through). You have the ability via some satellite thingy to travel into the future and inhabit the body of someone else in that future. You wake up in a cabin aboard a plane / airship and have to immediately come to grips with your new surroundings. The entire game is spent aboard this plane; you'll look for a traitor among the crew, negotiate with a mercenary, and try to keep the plane repaired and running. The moment gameplay starts, the conversations and choices begin.\nYou can view the opening of the game here.\n\nWhich are two of the primary strengths of Consortium. Choices abound, and result in genuinely different outcomes – NOT the same out come with minor variations. This means that, though short, replayability is high. There are a lot of dialogue options, with staying silent being a valid choice as well. With so much talking, the voice acting needs to be top-notch, and it is. A few characters seem a little flat, but the primary characters are unique and reactive. There are some very funny sci-fi references as well; like when you find someone dead, one of the conversation choices is, “He's wearing a red shirt; why should I care?” (Star Trek fans will know.)\n\nA supporting strength of Consortium is the lore. This is never forced on you – you have to go find it – but there are questions that can be asked, and bulletins to read that explain a lot of the world you find yourself in. Ranks are modeled on chess pieces (you play as a “bishop,” while answering to a “rook,” and primary crew are “pawns”). And gun play is good, though shooting doesn't need to happen much if you don't make certain choices. I did choose the more violent route, and the shoot-out on three decks of a plane / airship, blacked out, with only red emergency lights pulsing on and off, was a creepy yet exhilarating setting for a deadly game of cat and mouse.\n\nThe three decks of the plane / airship are fully explorable (including the crawl spaces). Characters are generally well-modeled, though assets are re-used frequently (while every character's face is different, all men have the same body type, as do women). The graphics and environment are fully 3-D, which is an interesting choice since the game could have gotten away with being a 2-D point-and-click (would have lost that feeling of freedom to explore if the devs had done that, though). The graphics quality is plain but utilitarian; it fits the setting.\n\nUsually a game's shortness would count heavily against it, but the high level of replayability counters that. Go into Consortium expecting dialogue-driven drama, and you'll easily get your money's worth. The game ends on a cliffhanger, but with the sequel recently Kickstarted, I hope the next episode comes soon! Value-wise, worth getting on sale for around $5, but if you want to support the developers, consider purchasing at full cost. Highly recommended.\n\nNote about crashes:\nI had a few where the game would just lock up and CTD. I set the game to run in Windows XP SP3 compatibility mode, and the crashes disappeared.

There is also an impressive amount of player agency within the small bounds of the scenario. The game's simple aesthetic mostly works well, though the bare animations do detract from immersion.\n\nUnfortunately the core experience of this game explicitly relies on save scumming (saving and loading to explore different gameplay options) and while saving is quick, the slow loading times are immersion-breaking when you try to follow the game's instruction to explore conversation trees. This is the main issue with the game as it stands: exploring the many complex branching conversations central to the game is changed from an exciting and fun experience into a slog.\n\nA few other, mostly minor, issues also detract from the game. Many conversations seem to just involve finding what to say to each character to increase their alignment- though many obvious exceptions make this a minor gripe and the game is still miles better than most other games in this regard. Combat is also limited, but functional, and given the scope and tone of the game the slight awkwardness may be appropriate. Finally, game-breaking bugs do exist but fortunately the developer seems to be active in supporting and fixing those as they are encountered.\n\nCONSORTIUM is pushing forward the boundaries of the art, and is certainly worthwhile. The game brings some intriguing ideas and a good story to the table, but sadly the load issue combined with other mechanical shortcomings were enough to push it slightly over the boundary to 'not-fun' for me. In my opinion it is worth supporting this game solely for the direction it is headed, but I would not recommend it to friends as a fun way to spend some time.","January 24","false","7.1"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","13","23","0","0"

If you like real time unskippable cut scenes, you'll love this. There's a lot of gushing over this being dynamic or choices with consquences, but that's significantly overstated.\n\nThe game developers packed a crap ton of text into the onboard computers, so... if you want you can read over twenty five six page articles about something about the setting this is suppose to take place in. The story takes place on a fairly claustrophobic cartoon ship and the combat mechanic is weak. The story is kinda meta and references you playing a game, but as like a serious acknowledgement woven into the story rather than tonge in cheek. There's a lame murder mystery thing, confused only by the fact all the characters have identical titles with a number and look pretty much the same too. The definitive "clue" makes no sense in the context of a saboteur committing murder. Contrived mystery is really central to what little there is here, so it shouldn't be a spoiler to say that aspect falls flat. Rest of the game is go from one cut scene to another cut scene. Sometimes you can walk away in the middle of a conversation, sometimes the door inexplicably locks behind you.\n\nAfter sitting through an eye rolling mission briefing about Osama Bin Laden's son taking a building hostage, you paratrooper from the plane and the game ends before it starts.\n\nIt probably would be an alright tutorial or intro to a game, but this probably shouldn't have been released as if it was a real game. I can't in good conscious recommend this to a general audience. Go play the Stanley Parable if you want an unconventional narrative and an exploration into player choice.","January 16","false","6.9"," 16 of 29 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","16","29","2","1"

The best way I can put this game into perspective is to think of the Mass effect series games, reduces its scope to just one setting but focus entirely on dialogues choices and characters interaction.  The setting you are playing on, a huge command plane similar to the BUS in Agents of SHIELD, is full of interesting characters, of which all of them are voiced over. The people you encountered are all believable; each has interesting thing to say either about themselves, their colleagues and the world around them. Conservations seem life-like as the choices are timed so you can’t be holding on to decide what to say next, and “say nothing” is always present for all dialogue options. You can even walk away during a conversation and the characters would react to it. Talking to them is a lot of fun; the dialogues are entertaining as well as giving background story about the world. There’s even a part which your answer is breaking the fourth wall, and at first it seem like a joke response to one of the character inquiry but to my surprise, later on the game the character actually referred back to your response and if you persist  enough will become one of the subplot.\n\nNow the story, essentially you are trying to solve a murder happened shortly while you are on board but as the story unfold it hinted on a larger mystery / conspiracy hangs in the shadow.  The story is engaging but slow at the beginning, it picked up pace around the middle but ended in a cliff hanger. I would say that’s the only negative thing about the game.\n\nCombat is simple and basic but it is not irrelevant. It does feel dated as it is still using the source engine.  With that said combat has a choice of lethal and non-lethal and a fairly basic inventory system. But seeing that you can actually complete the game without firing a single shot, there is definitely less emphasis on combat.\n\nAll in all I would definitely recommend this game as it mixed rpg, adventure game, and FPS into something that is quite unique.\n","December 20, 2014","true","2.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Your first clue is that it claims to be real. The deal is, you used a system by iDGi to take control of Bishop-6, a general-operations crewmember aboard the Zenlilth in the year 2043. The Zenlilth is a highly advanced plane containing a chess-based heirarchy, all working for the leaders of Consortium, King and Queen. Your purpose is to do stuff, and try not to screw up the plane too badly through traitors, mercenary attacks, and intrigue. There's even a section where the high leader of Consortium calls you specifically to tell you not to kill the guy you're controlling. It is, in my opinion, well-written and creative, and if Bioware RPG's are too busy for you, this is much more story-focused and less shooting and picking flowers.\nThe combat is unique, and takes backstage. As a "Bishop", you are supposed to know how to fight, but in the only big combat scene of the game people get a bit annoyed if you kill too many people (especially the leader). Story is unique and immersive, the ending is incredibly strange and yet not out of place. So much detail is put into a facade of reality that the same section of a game might be experienced with bad space/time continuum connection the first time, and some static the next. There's a lot more to learn and I've played through the game twice. Is it worth 20$? Maybe. Is it worth the money you pay when on sale for 33% off or more?

Which is not bad because this game is something new and something good.\n\nIt's not a shooter game, it is not RPG-by-stats game. But it is truly roleplaying adventure game where you talk to others, solve criminal case by looking for clues and asking questions. There are shooting sections, there is inventory management but te core of the game is playing your role and expressing it by actions, inactions, words spoken and unspoken. Great experience that changes rules how NPC interactions can be implemented in the game.\n\nI played this game twice, and even though i tought i do everything the same i got different choices to pick just because i rushed some conversation straight to the point or didnt click one thing. You can play your style, you can break 4th wall, you can try playing role of character you play - short game with replay value and some achievements on the list makes me wonder 'how is that even possible? ive checked everything' :P.\n\nDont be fooled by, maybe bad, screenshots - game looks really good when you play it and simplistic graphics serves it's purpose - you can clearly distinguish one NPC from another by simple features of face and haircut so when you are given task or clue to talk to somebody you can recognize them from afar.\nAnd even though game offers really limited space for your actions this space is used to its full extend. Scenery will change, rules will change, game will ofer new things within the same corridors.\n\nStory is solid and characters are well fleshed out. Some pieces of world lore or propaganda could be annoying as game obviously uses cliches, national stereotypes and puts real world politics or religious issues inside the game. Setting is parallel universes in future so why the game is full of nowadays topics? Feeling of being indoctrinated is so strong that everytime i see piece of this makes me roll my eyes and think 'omg, rly?'.\n\nAs i wrote earlier - it is not a shooter game so shooting is really basic and quite simple. Enemies are just dolls to be shoot at and only difficulty is their endurance. You can't use covers and all focuses on taking enemy down without much tactics on how to do it - just keep their silhouettes within your crosshair and keep button pressed down.\nYou can collect new gear, manage ammo and use energy to heal during battle but these features are not much used within this game.\n\nAnd why battle is in the game when there is not much action? Because it is just a first episode of upcoming action game where you enter the brawl in The Tower. It is like introductory sequence, shareware-alike kind of old games used to have where you had first episode to have fun and then you could buy full version. But for this one you have to pay full price in advance and episode will end up with a cliffhanger.\nOf course it is just information for the reader, not a flaw, i don't see a reason not to pay the devs for such a good piece of work.

I've played through it once already and just started a second playthrough, and I think I'll continue playing it beyond that. No point in explaining what the game is (just read the store page), but I will say that they ♥♥♥♥ing nailed it.\n\nStarting off with the writing, I was blown away. The lore is insanely extensive, which you can find by just playing the game or accessing the terminal on the ship or reading the "iDGi-1 Discoveries" compedium (included with the game for free). It's rare to see a game take its lore as seriously as this one does. The actual writing in the game's story is great as well, with characters having their own distinct personalities (as they should) - and the way you interact with (or don't) with these characters actually has an impact on the way they treat you and even the outcome of the story. The branching paths of the story not only make replayability possible, but they seem designed around taking advantage of replayability (and replaying actually fits the lore!) - a good comparison (apparently) is Undertale.\n\nGameplay-wise, the game is mostly talking to people. There are a few combat scenarios, one being in a virtual world, but for the most part you won't do much shooting. The combat itself can be approached in multiple ways, offering lethal, non-lethal, or a little of both. This also has a noticeable impact on the game and its world. The actual combat mechanics aren't anything amazing and are rarely used, so you probably shouldn't waste what little inventory space you have trying to carry an entire armory.\n\nNow the complaints! At times, the voice acting was particularly hammy - sometimes even outright bad. Most of the time it was just decent. Visually, the game was a headache - at least at first. I can appreciate an art style but the shadows and lighting just seemed to detract from everything, and it just felt like they were progressing backwards in their art direction. The UI is especially messy, and the main menu is an eyesore. I feel like this could be attributed to the engine, as Source is and was pretty severely dated at the time of this game's release. At least the sequel seems to be rectifying that.\n\nTo quickly address the length, it is short. I can see how some might think 3-5 hours is petty for a $15 game, but with the amount of replayability and the fact that replaying actually changes things, I'm alright with that price.\n\nIs it worth the money? Absolutely. I'm actually ashamed I got this for free, and would have gladly paid for it had I known it was this good (though I did back the sequel on Kickstarter, as should you if you're reading this within 24 days of posting).","January 26","true","5.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/f-ingsweet/recommended/264240/","f-ingsweet","Doctor Smiles","http://steamcommunity.com/id/f-ingsweet/","650 products in account","Today, I’m talking about a little first-person action-adventure game called CONSORTIUM. Developed and self-published by Interdimensional Games, Inc. The games development had its start in a successful Kickstarter campaign, which leads us to what we have today. CONSORTIUM’s story starts off with you, the player, travelling forward through time, and to a parallel universe, thanks to a satellite that allows us to connect to a sentient A.I. that exists in the other universe. In this future universe, it seems that everything is just about perfect. Global hunger, energy, and poverty problems has been resolved for the most part, and all forms of war have almost completely ceased. We have people living in space, on the moon, on Mars, you name it. But can things ever really be perfect?\n\nConsortium1You take the role of someone named Bishop Six, a field agent and peacekeeper of sorts in the Consortium, a society dedicated to protecting the galaxy or something. But all is not well, as soon after you arrive on your ship, the Zenlil, one of your shipmates is found dead in their bunkroom. Believing them to have been murdered by another shipmate, you are commanded to begin interrogating your shipmates to find out who the traitor is. If that weren’t enough, you also have the problem of a band of outlaws currently looking to take down your ship. It’s up to you to solve the mystery behind the murder, and take down the outlaws, among other things. But you better watch out, nobody can know where you’re really from, otherwise you might end up causing a temporal breakdown and destroy the universe!\n\nSo, let me tell you right now: Gameplay is where this game really shines. CONSORTIUM really isn’t an action game, so much as it is an immersive story told through its great character dialogue, its mysteries, and the in-game lore that comes with it. You communicate to the other characters on the ship through simple button presses, similar to a Telltale game. Alternatively, you can choose to say nothing and make everything awkward with your constant silence. Like I said before, one of the major goals is trying to find out who the murderer on your ship is, but naturally, things can never just be that simple. News gets spread fast on Zenlil, and before you know it, everybody on the ship knows what has happened, which naturally freaks them out. As you question and get to know your shipmates, you find that quite a few of them are less trustworthy than they appear, and others seem way too nervous or in some cases, optimistic about the whole situation. But, for those of you out there who decide that there isn’t enough shooting involved, there ARE action segments included with the game. Depending on how you choose to interact with other characters, you will be forced to engage in combat with bloodthirsty mercenaries who invade your ship, or shoot down enemy spaceships. You are also given the choice of capturing, or outright killing their leader. Just remember: Gameplay, as well as the story itself, might turn out differently depending on what you’ve chosen to do or not do.Consortium3\n\nEverything looks decent in terms of graphics, but the game was built on the constantly aging Source Engine, so you probably shouldn’t expect anything too fancy. Because it IS Source though, you can be almost certain that CONSORTIUM will run on even the lowest-end of gaming PCs. The sound effects are pretty good too, really helping encapsulate that claustrophobic feeling of being on a small little spaceship. The music is absolutely fantastic, but what do you expect when it’s composed by none other than Jeremy Soule, the same guy who did the music for such great games as Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, and Knights of the Old Republic? The developers really use the music to their advantage here when it comes to telling the story, and really puts an emphasis on the importance of what’s going on around you.\n\nIf there was one major flaw I could point out about this game, it’s that it was too short for my tastes. If you want a short, but good little immersive plot-central game, I recommend you try out CONSORTIUM. It’s currently on sale on Steam for $19.99.\n\nhttp://wtbfun.com/consortium-review/","October 15, 2014","true","6.7"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

In the end, the actual "game" is extremely lacking and the best bits really leave you wanting more. It might have a great sequel, but as it is, I can't recommend it.\n\nThe bad stuff. So there isn't really a game here. There are the concepts of a FPS intermixed and there are even a couple VR training sessions that show off a functional shooter. It's not great, but it's functional. Oh and there's a bug where apparently the AI cannot figure out where you are if you go up two ramps from the starting level.\n\nIn the game itself, there are at most two parts that can involve combat. If you play "correctly," there will be no combat though. If you don't, it's again not very good combat.\n\nSo the experience rests firmly on the story and the interactions. The actual writing of all of the lines is pretty good overall with respectable voice acting. There just isn't any real motivating force past either advancing the game or I don't have anything better to do to actually play along. There is a ton of information you clearly are left out of, but the game never really lets you into that. Maybe with some more context or something, I would care, but as presented, I just don't.\n\nSo that sounds like all of the game. Why would this be hard for me to say yes or no to the recommend to it? It sounds boring to bad overall.\n\nThere are glimmers of something great in here. The meta story could be actually pretty interesting. I would love for there to be more to it. At the end, it even seemed to be coming through a bit.\n\nThere actually seem to be characters in this game. People have glimmers of personalities and conflicts. That all seems great. No one happens to develop anywhere near enough for me to care about them, but I can see things there.\n\nThe entire game takes place on one (large) plane. I love that in such a condensed space, you can have quite a few interactions and it felt decently real (as in a reasonable series of events). Hell, even the plane felt appropriate where there were places for people to sleep and relax and eat and such while remaining very tight and small. Unfortunately those interactions all end up being boring.\n\nSo I really want to see what comes of the sequel which I believe starts kickstarting soon. This isn't the game I wanted to play, but it is a world I'm interesting in revisiting.","December 22, 2015","false","4.0"," 58 of 113 people (51%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","51","58","113","5","0"

I didn't expect it but it was really fun talking with all the crew and finding out whodunit. I really liked the freedom of choice in dialogues and compelling branching strory set in interesting future world.\n\nSometimes it was very hard to differentiate between all those numbered chess-like nicknames as whole hiearachy definitely needs some time to get used to (I would appreciate showing normal names anytime). Browsing through main terminal was mainly boring because most of the texts were written as interviews with too much beating around the bush (I would prefer shorter news-like summaries).

You're a traveller to a parallel universe's Earth where you play as a Bishop (lorewise, something between secret agent and one man army) on his first day on duty, aboard a plane called the Zenlil. From the start, you will be exploring highly branching conversation options with many of the crew's members. The only thing I had heard about the gameplay before going in was that "everything you do has a consequence", and I found that to be largely true.\n\nThe somewhat limited duration of the narration means you don't get to know all of the characters in depth; the lower-ranking servicemen in particular can be one-dimensional. For those you do get to know, you learn enough of to really want to see how they'd react to future situations as well. The voice acting is solid throughout.\n\nEverything in the graphics department feels source engine-ish. On the bright side, even as a player who will sometimes not play certain games solely because of the graphics, they didn't bother me too much. They got the job done well enough, and there was enough detail put in that they weren't bland.\n\nThe combat is clunky at best, and is by far the game's weakest point, but its presence does help with the setting, which was lovingly crafted (in that it'd be harder to believe your tough enforcer background without the combat scenes to prove you're as good as they say you are/should be).\n\nAlso, there's a news article database where you can read articles on the world's lore, many of them simply there for the curious.\n\nOverall, this was a very pleasant experience for me. I'd say it's a must-play for anyone looking for a great narrative delivered in a fresh way.","May 31","true","8.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you can look beyond the flaws, which I personally haven't really suffered, it's a fantastic game. I've only played around 3 hours (so Steam tells me) but I could swear it's been more. It's absolutely astounding, the visuals are interesting, and the world is so rich! There's a computer bank with literally thousands of ebooks in detailing the world. There's so much there I really can't even begin to absorb it. It's got a real diversity in playstyle, too. For example, the big bad of the first act, I looked him up, worked out a bit about his personality, and when speaking to him, played his ego and curiosity. This meant I could defeat him and his army, then his fleet without firing a single bullet or hurting anyone.\nAlternatively, I attempted a more violent approach, but I personally never found that to be the best way. The richness with the way you interact and chat with the characters makes you genuinely develop emotion towards them, not forced emotion, such as in The Walking Dead. They each have their own metric ton of things to say, and your behaviour changes their thoughts towards you, and the same will go for you.\n\nThe setting is very rich, like a Gerry Anderson serial, or something. I was strongly reminded of Spectrum, with the whole codename system and flying base. The only sort of problem with this is that nearly every character is designated as Pawn and then a number. This means I got very confused when investigating an incident that comes out through the game. I actually ended up screwing my alignment utterly with two characters and failing to find the bad guy. This did sort of annoy me, but the game does tell you that regular saves are a good idea, and I decided to not do that to add a more permanent level to my choices.\nI can imagine that there's so many ways to approach this game, so I can't comment on the scope of it. It can also be very tense in some parts, like when you're being interrogated about your name and stuff.\nAll in all, this is one of those games you will love if you can focus past things like attempting the usual tutorial and introduction dialouges with NPCs being met with "Are you feeling okay? You've forgotten everything" and other things. The developers have also promised to fix the bugs that have damaged some people's experience, too.","January 9, 2014","true","10.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I beat it in about 3 hours. However, there are multiple ways that it can play out, so there is a whole lot of replayability.

I could blab about what everyone else has already said, but I'll just say "ditto" to what the positive reviews are in agreement about. It's a fun experience. If you are wanting a first person shooter, I can promise you this game will not deliver on that front. You play in first person and there are a couple of parts where you may shoot, but they're pretty weak and not very good. I kinda feel like the game doesn't actually need any first person (or third) shooting at all, but I suppose that might be for the sake of empowerment and a bit of realism. Long story short, the shooting sucks, but that's almost non-existent in the game. I feel like I'm making the game sound bad, but I really liked it and will buy the sequel at launch, if/whenever that might be. The story is great and there seem to be a lot of different options and ways some events can play out.

Every one choice you make, every word you say can be VERY important and change the whole outcome of the story. The best word to describe this game is a simulator.

It has this slight feeling of leaning towards AAA games, but instead of being a few hour long rollercoaster ride with splosions and lols, it focuses more on ideas while providing more gamplay than usual indie titles.\nStory is the main point in the game, but it has so many branches that it would require a dozen playthroughs to get them all.  In one conversation you can change the whole outcome of the game, then in the next one, you might change it all again, everything depends on your choice. You can be a modest doing-my-job guy or a cocky ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ or a complete weirdo. And again, this may or may not impact the outcome. Honestly before this game I did not think you can make so many changes in story with  2-5 dialogue choices.\nWhile the game has combat which is moderate (and that's what makes the game lean towards AAA FPS rather than being full chit-chat indie title), it can completely avoided through dialogue OR you can turn the game into a bloodbath.\nGraphics aren't impresive but bearable (though somewhat unusual, thus giving some originality to the game), same about sounds.\nCONSORTIUM combines FPS, RPG and mystery solving while being heavily story driven, and makes me wish more AAA titles would adopt such ways of story telling.

All good fun. All while trying to figure out what's going on with the metagame without letting slip that you're actually a remote-control operator from the past in 2013.\n\nThe 4th-wall-breaking conceit behind the game is that the entire game is apparently a VR simulator delivered to you at your PC via uplink to a satellite which is making use of tachyon bursts or some ♥♥♥♥ to transmit temporally-adjusted data with an advanced, benevolent AI in the future, allowing you to remote-control an specific, nominated avatar at a fixed point in the future, generating a number of 'branched' alternate realities - based on your decisions - which the AI can track via other satellites in other parallel universes, spreading itself as a single entity functioning on nodes across all of them.\n\nThe rest of the story is best kept a mystery because it's kind of fun getting clues from the crew about the world lore and politics etc, without asking the standard, "Duh, so what is the deal with [Major Faction even a child should know about]?" RPG questions. Those options are still there but the crew will think you're a bit dozy or incompetent because of it, and start to regard you suspiciously or with hostility.\n\nThere's an in-game encyclopedia, but it seems like it only decelerates time to a certain degree to allow you to catch up, meaning that significant events and conversation opportunities can pass by or run their course without you. A veteran can probably see where most of the threads are underlying all this, and manipulate things appropriately, but if you let the smoke and mirrors do their job, I'd say this one's a fun one to get into.\n\nThe mechanics of combat and the rest are not the smoothest, occasionally fiddly and unintuitive, but you can avoid most twitch-dependency if you're so inclined, through game-choices. It's definitely more substance than style, with some kind of dated graphics.  Either way, none of this got in the way for me, so I can pretty confidently give this an overall thumbs up.","January 10, 2014","true","4.3"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","2"

After finishing this game in one session, I realized that I couldn't have been more wrong.\n\nCONSORTIUM is best compaired with story-rich First Person games like the original Deus Ex or the Mass Effect series. First, I'll get to the games strongest points. The Story is kinda weird, but in an awesome way. You make up your own background story, your seekings and how your attitude. Since you are in an to you unknown world, this leads to some comical missunderstanding, both showing a great humor and sometimes breaking the 4th wall. There are also no cutscenes in this game, never robbing you of its control and always being able to decide whether you want to be nice to someone, ♥♥♥♥ them off, just walk away from a conversation or simply staying silent. There are a lot of choices and interessting stuff to explore that you will miss in your first playthrough. In addition, most characters are enough fleshed out to be interessting and have an own personality.\n\nIf you are searching for a good shooter, CONSORTIUM might not be the right choice as I found the combat system and ammo managment to be kinda confusion. It works for the time being but has much room for improvements. If you want a great story, great characters, many choices and an awesome time, get it.\n\nAn amazing masterpiece that only Indiedevelopers can bring forth.","March 2","true","4.4"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","6","11","0","0"

CONSORTIUM is a game that holds itself together with its plot, but that's where it suffered.\n\nTo truly appreciate everything the developers are trying to do, you need to read reems and reems of backstory prose, delve into blogs, read "musings", and even play another game by the same developers. The combat is pretty terrible - it could have been removed or simplified without any real impact to the game. You're constantly thrust into weird scenarios in which everyone else seems to know something you don't. There is a *lot* of talking. Yes, the plot is very important, but sometimes you're going to feel more like a passenger than a driver.\n\nThe concept of the game itself being a gateway into an alternate reality broke my immersion more than anything else. The fourth wall was broken and never ended up being repaired. I soon stopped caring about the characters, the ship, or the mission. The setting just didn't have a good draw. The technology is advanced, and there are some interesting concepts in there, but the game might have been more interesting with more simplification.\n\nSet it on an orbiting spaceship instead of an aeroplane; provide a concise glossary or encylclopaedia; cut down the number of weapons to just one (you don't need a lethal assault rifle with a stun-grenade launcher attachment *and* a stun gun with a lethal laser mode); and most of all - utilise SHOW instead of TELL as a storytelling/exposition tool.\n\nI read all of the database entries in Mass Effect because they enhanced my experience, but in CONSORTIUM the extra information is pretty much mandatory reading if you want to understand what's going on - and the entries are *really* long. Let me put it this way: I can tell you all about the First Contact War and how the Mass Relays work in Mass Effect, but I'm still not sure I know what the Consortium itself actually is, what its ideals are, or how it does what it's supposed to be doing.\n\nConversing with the crew and interacting with them is really important, but if you miss one or two key lines, you can miss a heck of a lot of content (and it really hurts your chances of solving the main mystery).\n\nIf you get excited over the idea of a computer game pretending to be a door into another dimension where you can tell people "I'm from another world, playing a computer game, and you're all characters in that computer game. If I load a saved game, I'm breaking the timeline and creating another alternate reality..." then maybe you'll enjoy CONSORTIUM, but for me it was laid on a bit too thick.","May 18, 2014","false","8.2"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","0"

After a four hour experience, there have been dozens of questions created and none really answered.

There are dozens of pages of lore contextualizing every character in the plot, every event in the meta-narrative, and the vision of the future created for this game. This is exactly what people of a certain old school demographic in gaming claim to want in an RPG, but it is instead built upon a mediocre Half Life-esque shooter's skeleton.\n\nI say that, but there is more than one path to progress through the game in which the player doesn't need to engage in combat at all. In fact, Consortium places gunplay in the back seat, leaving the plot to be the driving force. The more active gameplay is, however, still in the car, unlike other "games" lauded for their plot but devoid of anything but the simplest interactivity. There is challenge to the combat, sometimes born of the situations, sometimes born of the tight spaces of the ship or the sheer number of enemies players are expected to deal with in one fight. There are also minigames, most notably a Missle Command-esque game that, while not difficult, is engaging enough. The point is, Consortium, while focused on story, does not shun gameplay, or even the fact that it is a game. There are even dialogue options for players who wish there to be no 4th Wall at all.\n\nAnd the subject of dialogue options brings me to the final point in this game's favour: The degree to which the player shapes the story. Consortium is near the level of Obsidian's Alpha Protocol in terms of the permutations each event can have, and each conversation, no matter how trivial, has at least two different potential statements a player can make. This helps immensely in helping the player engage with the rest of the cast, who are all distinct in personality, and for the most part well acted, even if some performances are clearly better than others.\n\nAs I said, Consortium is a big boy alternative to the walking simulator; games that use a focus on story as an excuse to be little more than a film with a few QTEs or childishly easy puzzles. It has RPG-level depth at FPS prices and is not ashamed to go into the absolute minutia about the world it seeks to build for future sequels. If those sequels stay true to this game while improving the more combat-oriented approaches, they would deserve consideration alongside the greats in the Science Fiction genre of video games.","March 12, 2014","true","4.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

If you love stories that are changed by lots of choices then this is the game for you. My only complaint is the combat seems to cause my fps to drop by a large amount although the rest of the game runs perfectly, I probably just have one of the settings wrong or something. The atmosphere in the game is very immersive. It can also be quite creepy, for example, getting stuck in the crawl and the lights go out.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/stambo/recommended/264240/","stambo","stambo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/stambo/","1618 products in account","To me personally this was an incredibly interesting game. It completely subverted my expectations about it when I started playing it. I am so used to getting into a game, listening to 10-15 min of expostition and story content that isn't developed or focused on again until the end, that when I went past that point with CONSORTIUM I was slightly taken aback and realized that this truly is a story focused RPG. And best of all it managed to hold my attention to the story throughout the whole game, and only games with great stories have managed that (sadly, there aren't too many of those). Perhaps this is only a side effect of the fact the game is unexpectedly short, even the story itself doesn't have a good conclusion. It is very much dependant on a sequel, however it is not yet clear if we are going to get one.\n\nThe game also has an FPS element to it, which is very much underdeveloped. You have an inventory and equipment system, which you manage throughout the game, so that you will be optimally prepared for combat when the need arises for it. But sadly, that moment doesn't ever come. Not really that is, there are two seperate instances in the game where you can use weapons, in the first one it is clear that the game is pushing you towards the non-violent path. The second one is a bit more mandatory, however you can win that fight simply by waiting it out...\n\nCONSORTIUM reminded me of the times when you are aboard the Normandy in the Mass Effect games and you go around talking to your crewmembers, getting to know them and their story and actually progressing the overall story somewhat. I enjoyed that part in the Mass Effect games, it made me connect with the characters. This game only has that part, but it does it so much better. It would appear they also tried to make the combat part, but given how little importance it has I would imagine they simply didn't have the budget for it.\n\nThere are two major disappointments I have with the game. Firstly, its short lenght, and secondly, the present but never developed FPS portion of the game. Seeing all the possibilities this game has on offer I was starting to think this game would be something truly amazing, with a meaning story that made you care about the characters within it, which would connect all the different missions you would embark upon. However, the sad fact is, the game ends before the first mission truly begins.\n\nWith that said I can also now reveal that the whole story in the game takes place aboard an airplane (supposedly also a spaceship), and you are fully confined within it throughout the game. All the story elements come from interacting with the people within it (well, almost all), and so it is a good thing that, for the most part, they are well written and voice acted. And with a multitude of dialogue choices and possible story paths there is never a single clear choice to take, there are only the choices you want to make. That is what is most appealing about this game, and it is also what gives it replayability, despite being so heavily story focused. I am a bit disappointed with how it ended and so I won't be replaying it any time soon, only when the sequel comes out (hopefully).\n\nPerhaps the game I envisioned after a couple of hours of play could only have been achieved with a large budget, or perhaps we will get that game after all with multiple sequels of this one. Despite this, CONSORTIUM is worth buying and playing, you just need to be prepared for a fully story focused game and you'll enjoy yourself.\n\n7 / 10","December 26, 2014","true","4.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Other than a few bugs, I found my first playthrough to be very enjoyable. The story and choices were fun aspects. The universe and technology was really interesting. The theme, while initially was a little challenging to follow, turned out to be very facinating. By the time the game was done, I was begging for more. And that's actually where the problem comes in.\n\nThe game invites you to play it over-and-over, but I couldn't. But the game length wasn't long enough to justify it another play through. Even despite the different narrative choices and the mechancal aspects that intertwine the changing story and gameplay, the overarching story will be the same. And it just feels too samey with the other playthroughs.\n\nWhen the game ended, I was disappointed. It felt like I just finished the very entertaining and scene setting prolog, and it was game over.\n\nOther criticisms include the fourth wall being broken; that just never seems to quite work. I want to get immersed in an RPG-like game, I don't want it to point out "Hey. You're playing a video game!" - Let me be a part of this beautiful world. I fullly grasp the attempt at the metaplot. But it just didn't work for me.\n\nThere's so much potential in this game.\n\nUltimately, Consortium creates a beautiful setting, with smart game mechinisms. I would absolutely recommend people play it. But due to short narrative, unsatisifying cliff-hanger, and a few other minor things, I would only suggest picking it up when it is on sale.","July 13, 2014","true","4.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I was lucky enough to start playing once the final patch was released, so I experience little to no bugs. CONSORTIUM is based in the year 2042 or something like that. You take control of Bishop 6, which at first, you know nothing about. If you make certain choices, you may never know about his past. I love this game, you can choose from so many paths that will ultimatly lead to one ending and one ending only. Although the ending dissapointed me, because I really don't like waiting for sequels and the way they ended CONSORTIUM leaves the player thinking about his choices that he had made, what he should go back change, and it also leaves the player craving more. Well, atleast it left me craving more. The developers said that the first public release about the next CONSORTIUM is going to be released very soon. You may not be able to tell, but I am VERY excited.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nRating: 9/10 One of the most replayable, and enjoyable games since ever!","April 12, 2015","true","5.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

While any gamer can appreciate the devs putting in a good amount of work to create an original world and story for the game, the delivery of the information is done poorly. Your thrown into the game and have to rely on hundreds of articles in a information console to understand what is happening around you which is very frustrating. You'll also be spending about 80% of your time just reading and talking to people and that gets BORING. The game also has this emptiness about it which is very difficult to explain.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Oberain/recommended/264240/","Oberain","Oberain","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Oberain/","464 products in account","Tl;Dr -  A good game with a lot of potential with interesting writing and world building marred by poor combat.  Unfortunately felt like an incomplete experience that ended far too soon.\n\nConsortium is at heart an adventure/rpg tasking players with finding who the traitor is aboard an airsip and bringing them to justice.  The premise alone sounds interesting but the problem is unlike both RPGs and adventure games items in the game world are essentially just fodder to be recycled to provide power for your armor.  Despite a few times the game tryign to bring attention to certain items, at no point could they be picked up and examined making rifling through people's storage lockers and whatnot pretty pointless.  At no point did I feel like I was a detective trying to get to the bottom is a mystery but rather just going around having a casual chat with murder suspects with no actual ability to dig deeper and snoop around their personal belongings to try to contradict their stories.  As a matter of fact most snooping and gathering of information is taken from a newsfeed console that works like a text based "Her Story".  Keywords are used to search for documents and those can be read and new keywords attempted to piece together background and knowledge about characters in the world.\n\nWhile I liked this in Her Story I found it rather tedious in Consortium.  On the one hand, yeah it's nice to have an abundant amount of lore I can read through and learn from but on the other hand...the console isn't very well explained.  Half of the...articles?  Documents?  Whatever I'm supposed to call them are sometimes written as though they were intended to be actual posted texts and other times are written with action cues in them as if they were works of fiction or we were expected to imagine we were watching a video.  This confused tone gave the overall experience a bit of a amateurish vibe as if they weren't quite sure what they really wanted to do with with console research...so they did everything with it.  Also many documents you can search for are obviously meant to be top secret yet anyone and everyone can pull them up with relatively mundane search terms in terminals found in common areas.  I would of rather much of this information be put into the actual game world such as a paper in someone's locker or personal computer or find some notes that lead me to think they have a background in programming, search under someone's bed and find some other tidbit of information...you know...actually doing stuff with the game world.  Trying to pick up a book or examine something will simply destroy the item and recycle it's energy to power your armor as stated before which...is...mostly pointless.  It seems strange so many junk items are littered around the cramped spaces of the plane when the game has only two or maybe three combat encounters total.\n\nIt also doesn't help that when these sparse combat situations happen the FPS elements are clearly lacking.   The entire experience felt as if this game had come from a past generation where early full 3D FPSes were just stepping out of Wolfenstien 3D's primordial FPS ooze.  Gunplay lacks finesse with mindless enemies running at you guns blazing with no real use of cover or indication that the people you are fighting are real people (a story trope that is hammered in a few times) but rather mindless drones sent at you like so many Doom Imps from times of yore.  You are given essentially a lethal and non lethal method of dealing with enemies but without a system in place to aid in actual non lethal combat it becomes an excercise in tedium.  Instead of methodically taking down enemies trying not to alert the hive, you're stuck with a gun having to charge blasts that may or may not take down an enemy down with very little to no feedback as to what's working and why.  Once and enemy is downed you're expected to run over to them and knock them out completely before they manage to get back up lending even more tedium to an already horrible system.  While you are given a generous amount of time to get this done, it's still very likely you're going to have to charge into the middle of the battle to try to snag all the enemies at once before they get back up leaving the rest to keep shooting you.  It's an utterly unrewarding experiance they were better off scrapping from the game entirely.\n\nThankfully the combat is the least important part of the game as you spend most of your time wandering the plane and getting to know it's crew.  This is the meat of the gameplay and is actually done pretty well. You're expected to respond to people in a timely manner and just about everything you say is remembered and has some degree of impact later on giving a pretty good illusion of dealing with real people.  This attention to detail does come back to bite the game as you are often given a limited set of responces and have found on some occations the only sensible option was to stand there awkwardly and say nothing at all.  It's a shame the world itself wasn't given this degree of treatment as I think they could of crafted something rather special.  Each character's opinion of you is tracked seperately though I have yet to actually see this make any kind of major difference other than an indication of if they like you or not.  Only the officers in the ship seem to actually matter as you spend most of your time talking and consulting with them and some Consortium characters only appear for literally a single conversation (yet their approval is still tracked).  Replaying this game is pretty much mandatory as your first run will mostly be spent trying to figure out what the game wants from you and what you can actually do in the world to effect events going on; while this is all very well and good a full third of the game is tedious tutorial things that was interesting only the first time through yet were unskippable since.\n\nIn the end my lack of a recommendaiton came down to one thing;  The original demo for Deus Ex.  You see, throughout the entire game I kept mentally likening this to Deus Ex.  The RPG/FPS elements, the clunkiness of how just about everything works yet is not quite clunky enough to make me want to stop playing and, quite frankly, the very similar plot lines.  Deus Ex was one of my favorite games growing up and I remember being impressed by the size and length of it's demo...which was about as long as this entire game. Suffice to say I can't recommend a game that bills itself as a complete product when it's clearly geared to be an episodic release.  I have to admit the game started off on a bad foot with me when I booted it up, was immediatley told of the kickstarter for the "direct continuation".  So I just got this game and now you want funding for chapter two?  The entire plot of the game felt like it was leading to this long and epic storyline that never came.  The game just ended...on a cliffhanger no less.  A cliffhanger whose conclusion they now want me to go fund out of my pocket so I can go buy the second episode of this game.\n\nThis has a lot of potential and I could gladly overlook all of the negative aspects if I felt I was given a complete game.  Unfortunately by the time I first saw those credits roll, my reaction wasn't "Man that was awesome", it was "You have to be kidding me  All that buildup to the first actual mission in the game it wasn't even IN THE GAME."\n\nPerhaps if the plot was packaged differently and I didn't feel as though I was just railroaded into the next purchase I would be recommending this, but as it stands I just feel disappointed the game fell short of it's potential.","January 17","false","6.7"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","0"

You choose that "lines" to tell to the NPCs you interact with.\nWhen you start the game you don`t start dirrectly into the tutorial area. The tutorial area can be acessed from a smallroom closet-like by acessing a terminal there. From there you will be teleported into a virtual area where a robotic voice tells you mainly how to shoot things.\nYes, it may sounds cool but it really isn`t.\nThe graphics of menu and font used in game is really terrible.

The focus is directed entirely towards areas that most games don't get enough love in. Graphics are passable, and there are some minor glitches, but this game is all about the story. With a playtime of 3-5 hours and a multi-dimensional story line, replay value is through the roof. The short playtime also makes CONSORTIUM fairly easy to play in one sitting, which highlights another of its greatest strengths: the way you influence this world really is entirely based on the decisions you make. Each playthrough you are encouraged to adopt a new approach, and seeing the story all the way through in one sitting allows you to stick to the personality you have assumed. There are only a few instances where combat is required, and even then you can avoid lethal force. Or you can kill everyone, but be prepared for there to be consequences.\n\nIn summary:\n\nPROS\nExcellent voice acting\nSmooth writing\nReal impact from your decisions\nReplay value 11/10\n\nCONS\nBelow average graphics\nGlitchy, but improving with patches\nLots of looking around in your first playthrough, no guides online that i could find, wiki is incomplete","January 20","true","14.8"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Did you like Mass Effect or (insert equivalent Bioware game) and, like me, took every possible opportunity to find as much of the dialog as possible? Are you a person who would let a really interesting plot, story and characterization apologize for lacking gameplay? Can you play a game like To the Moon and end thinking "Wow, can’t wait to play it again" rather than "This 'game' cheated me out of the 'game'"? If you answered yes to one or more of these, buy this "game."\n\nKinda spoiler, but not really since they tell you this all before even starting the game. Since nobody says these things, I was incredibly confused about what the game really was before purchasing and almost didn’t. Read on so that doesn’t happen to you...\n\nThe game is a strangely absorbing, 4th-wall-breaking interactive story where you, the player, body snatch (v) a dude in one of an infinite number of alternate dimensions (meaning you can reload or start over from scratch as much as you want, but the setting/characters/whatnot all stay the same) and play through a series-of-unfortunate-events scenario through his eyes, yet maintain your memories and are fully capable of telling everybody you’re just a body pilot playing a video game. Think Outer Limits or Twilight Zone and you won’t be too far from the truth. There is an organization on the far end of this dimensional rift called Consortium that thinks it’s cute to name all its members after chess pieces and then expect the "pawns" to be emotionally stable members of the team. Honestly, I think the concept is clever, but it makes it very difficult to remember who everybody is; kind of a big issue with characterization this strong.\n\nAnywho, the problem most people had with this game is that it’s not complete. The game abruptly ends damn near without warning in what I would consider to be the climax and then tells you "To be continued..." They do kinda mention this in the description, but don’t make it as obvious as other similar games like the Walking Dead, Broken Age or Life is Strange. They say it’s a "trilogy," which implies three complete games. No, this game is not complete. Again: nothing wrong with an episodic method of release, but that ending really did deflate my balloon in a very anticlimatic way...\n\nI still recommend this, though, even though it’s incomplete because it’s still an enjoyable experience and I am very much looking forward to the sequel/continuation announced just this January.","March 15, 2015","true","5.7"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Your conversations feel a little more real and emersive, and the choices you can make can quickly turn a shakey relationship sour, causing not just that character, but others to react differently in entirety, not just a small quip or comment made at somepoint, highlighting your choice for 5 seconds of "ah ha!" and then fading into obsurity like nothing really mattered in the end. The characters you interact with all have unique personalities and react like people, not exposition-spouting info logs at your disposal. In the end, I was satisfied with it. It held my interest, made me think, and didn't make me feel like I was being held by the hand and led through a tour.

I have managed to play 19 hours roughly, and damn they were intense. The story has enough twists and turns in the story with elements that may not contribute to the main story but give it context.\n\nExample: You talk to a crew member, and find out that they have a deep friendship with blah blah crew member. They then defend said member in a disagreement that splits the crew, this actually now makes sense.\n\nYou get a lot story context, with things like you are supposed to be a combat specialist, and due to this you can use the virtual training program. People are suprised when you don't know about weaponry and what country made equiptment. It makes sense. That is why I love this game.

You find yourself as a player transported into the body of someone in another dimension (yes just like Nomad Soul) who is kind of a heavy gunner type assassin for the crew of a high tech Bowing747. The idea for the game seems to have been to throw crises at the crew and allow the player in an interactive fiction type way to be an instrumental part of the crews survival, with a combination of free roaming, actions on the ship, dialogue and if the player wants to, combat.\n\nYour experience here is short without any completed story arcs, not that the game is long enough to do a good one. The poor writing starts when you are thrown into a world without any boot strapping to tell you anything about what is going on. I only became comfortable with the organisation I was working for and even knew what my character's role on the ship was after doing some reading outside of the game, after my first play through. The dialogue is poor, mainly because the characters lack real depth, the events in the game are pulled right from badly written 90's films (Under Siege 1992). Combat is clunky, when there is combat, and the combat simulator missions are unfinished and not, fun.\n\nThis game has so many bugs! And I played the 1.2 Master Edition which is a re-release, as the first version contained a lot of bugs. CONSORTIUM does not feel like a well tested or polished experience. This really needed more time in development. The component parts are here, but it hasn't been crafter or polished into a fine product.\n3/5","May 7, 2014","false","13.8"," 9 of 18 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","9","18","0","0"

I would be nicer about this seeing how it was made by an inde group and this could be something much larger then it looks plus this is an ongoing development, but the game ultometly has choices that appear to mean nothing. I understand what they were attempting to do because it worked for games like Wolf Among us and Left for Dead the issue is that they want to charge people 15$ for an incompleat game. All the choices evenchualy lead up to the same conclusion that you need to go to "the tower" and for the same reson. If the game didn't take me 3 hrs to beat the 1st time though or if the choices made me cair about the indivigual people in the story then maybe the game would have been worth 15$ but, you are paying for the first half (or maybe more) of a game that had a big selling point of "your choices matter" but they dont feel like they do and I could cair less if villen nomber one lives or dies or if the piolet lives or dies because at no point did any of them show mutch of who they where.

It throws you in the deep end plot-wise, but that is actually a plus for this game as you work out just what kind of situation in. Quickly into the plot, it develops into mysterious and, for once, actually believable mystery game. The one (or two, depending on your choices, I hear) proper shooting sequence has mechanics decent enough to make it enjoyable and I assume it's a taste test for the sequel, which will likely have more. Kudos to the developer for making the mystery cohesive and giving the player a truly stumping series of events. I only got it right because I noticed the culprit doing some dodgy acts before the investigation. The culprit was believable and I did not find myself irritated by any cliches. The plotline thankfully avoids many, many cliches. It is also brilliantly well acted, and the variance of accents really gives it a feeling of a futuristic, almost united world. The plot also reminds me of 1984, and gives the player perfect reason to support any of the factions (or neither, like me). I find most games flop when they try to write as intricate plot as this, either falling into cliche or simply being way too over its head to be coherent or well written. This game, however, does it well and gets a high reccomendation from me. A little short, but still well worth the investment. Can't wait for the sequel.\n\nBy the way, your choices change a lot. Unlike most games *cough cough* Telltale's Game of Thrones *cough cough*, every choice is significant and you also know when a significant decision must be made. You understand the severity of the events at all time and the game throughout is very intense. I'm so glad this game did its choices and consequences right.","January 18","true","4.6"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/uileat/recommended/264240/","uileat","Uileat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/uileat/","762 products in account","To start:  I love this game.  But, it can be little rough at the moment.\n\nI was a backer on this game during Kickstarter, I was very intrigued at the setting, art style, and gameplay premise.  It seemed to be a unique take and full of great new ideas.  In this respect the game did not dissapoint me.  The weighted crew interactions are very well done and I found the voice work to be pretty good.  The first core gameplay centers around conversations with crew members of the Zenlil, navigating dialog trees to increase or decrease approval with different crew members and opening up new lines of inquiry and knowledge.  The second is exploring the Zenlil craft and interacting with it, though in this game it is a bit limited by what the scripting allows.  Third is the FPS combat, and in my particular playthrough it took a backseat, though depending in your actions you could get a lot more.\n\nThe story and plot started off well and became more and more intrigueing as the game progressed.  It takes place in the future, where your psyche has taken possession of a soldier on the combat aircraft Zenlil of the international Consortium.  Your mind has been sent forward to this realm through a special satellite system presented as a game.  But is it really a game?  What are the true motives of those who control the system?  And what might happen if you try to test the limits of that control?  Play to find out.\n\nThe world of Consortium is surprisingly deep, and there is an in-game knowledge center for those who really like to dig into the lore.  Multiple in-game hints also indicated that there is an ARG that links to the world that provides more background.  By the end I found myself with a few "Oh Wow" moments that really have me looking forward to the second Consortium game.\n\nNow for a few negatives.  Despite the tremendous quality of the game from a small indie developer, the many branching pathways and moving parts are pretty complex, and I ran into quite a few bugs right off the bat.  I began playing with the Humble Bundle download version, and it seemed to have several issues with NPC pathing, especially getting stuck in doorways, blocking access and forcing me to start over.  I also ran into situations where the scripting would get out of sync and I would, for example, get caught in a loop where I ended a conversation and then the airplane exploded, only the reload at the last save and explode again.  The solution?  Save, save, save.  Once I got into the old school habit of making an incremental save between different encounters, I was able to work around various issues and continue playing.\n\nWhen I got my key and changed to the Steam version, I noted it seemed to work better and several bugs present in the Humble version were not present.\n\nOverall I am extremely pleased with my decision to back these fine folks on Kickstarter and have greatly enjoyed the game.  Those who are not patient enough to deal with progress halting bugs should avoid for now, and await patches which are swiftly being worked on.  The setting is incredibly rich and begs to be expanded in future titles, which I eagerly await.","January 11, 2014","true","5.8"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Did you like Mass Effect or (insert equivalent Bioware game) and, like me, took every possible opportunity to find as much of the dialog as possible? Are you a person who would let a really interesting plot, story and characterization apologize for lacking gameplay? Can you play a game like To the Moon and end thinking "Wow, can’t wait to play it again" rather than "This 'game' cheated me out of the 'game'"? If you answered yes to one or more of these, buy this "game."\n\nKinda spoiler, but not really since they tell you this all before even starting the game. Since nobody says these things, I was incredibly confused about what the game really was before purchasing and almost didn’t. Read on so that doesn’t happen to you...\n\nThe game is a strangely absorbing, 4th-wall-breaking interactive story where you, the player, body snatch (v) a dude in one of an infinite number of alternate dimensions (meaning you can reload or start over from scratch as much as you want, but the setting/characters/whatnot all stay the same) and play through a series-of-unfortunate-events scenario through his eyes, yet maintain your memories and are fully capable of telling everybody you’re just a body pilot playing a video game. Think Outer Limits or Twilight Zone and you won’t be too far from the truth. There is an organization on the far end of this dimensional rift called Consortium that thinks it’s cute to name all its members after chess pieces and then expect the "pawns" to be emotionally stable members of the team. Honestly, I think the concept is clever, but it makes it very difficult to remember who everybody is; kind of a big issue with characterization this strong.\n\nAnywho, the problem most people had with this game is that it’s not complete. The game abruptly ends damn near without warning in what I would consider to be the climax and then tells you "To be continued..." They do kinda mention this in the description, but don’t make it as obvious as other similar games like the Walking Dead, Broken Age or Life is Strange. They say it’s a "trilogy," which implies three complete games. No, this game is not complete. Again: nothing wrong with an episodic method of release, but that ending really did deflate my balloon in a very anticlimatic way...\n\nI still recommend this, though, even though it’s incomplete because it’s still an enjoyable experience and I am very much looking forward to the sequel/continuation announced just this January.","March 15, 2015","true","5.7"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Your conversations feel a little more real and emersive, and the choices you can make can quickly turn a shakey relationship sour, causing not just that character, but others to react differently in entirety, not just a small quip or comment made at somepoint, highlighting your choice for 5 seconds of "ah ha!" and then fading into obsurity like nothing really mattered in the end. The characters you interact with all have unique personalities and react like people, not exposition-spouting info logs at your disposal. In the end, I was satisfied with it. It held my interest, made me think, and didn't make me feel like I was being held by the hand and led through a tour.

It reminded me a lot of Mass Effect 2 in that regard, but with more life to it because people aren't always in the exact same spots. The graphics are nothing special, but they do fit with the art style. I loved that every choice in this game seemed to matter (we'll have to wait until part 2 to see how much), but it was nice to see immediate consequences and not just a change in an arbitrary karma bar llike some games. Yes, I'm looking at you Mass Effect 2. Speaking of a sort of karma bar, there isn't one, at least not one visible to the player and I for one loved it for that. As long as it's done well having no number attached to your actions that the player can see makes it mroe immersive and stops the player from "counting karma". The choices make a difference and aren't just things referenced in one line of dialogue lateer and forgot. A lot of your choices determine who lives and who dies, a thing most games are afraid to do and save for the last minutes of a game.\n\nThe Bad: Glitches. There are quite a few, but there's nothing that can't be fixed fairly easily. Aside from the game crashing when you alt-tab, there's no crash related bugs I've encountered. I run two 660 ti's in sli so I fully expected crashed and other stupid stuff, but it never came to that. The framerate is a bit choppy and others have mentioned it as well. I don't know if that's because of sli or just some other weirdness. It wasn't ever bad enough to where I couldn't play the game. It's a bit on the short side for 19.99, but I think the replayability makes up for it. Going through the game again with vastly different choices should have a huge effect on the story and make your game completely different.\n\nThe Ugly; I don't really have anything for this section. There aren't any really bad bugs, at least nothing on the scale of bluescreening or anything that severe.\n\nIn summary I loved this game. It is a little weird, but if you like the idea of a plot driven game then this is it. By plot driven game I mean it's not like most games where they wait for you forever and ever. This game will go on without you to a certain extent, but not to the point of where you feel like you're being dragged behind a car. I would say right now, get it on the sale that is going (at the time of this review) if you think you might want to try it and then wait for a patch. Like I mentioned before the glitches aren't super bad, but they may irritate some people. The developers seem quick on the uptatke and seem to care about fixing the bugs however. :)","January 9, 2014","true","11.8"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","2"

True there are glithches but with so many options the game give you to solves a problem it is not a surprise. But if you can live with a few bugs it is still a good game. The story is great;\n\nYou play as you in the body of an officer named Bishop-6 a new and important crew member on ZENLIL a Consortium Command vessel. Your job is to get the crew out of trouble and they get into a lot.\n\nYou can talk to the crew members wou all have there own unique personalities, and I even uncovered a Hilarious star trek references in a few conversations I had. Love it.\n\nI love this game, it isn't perfect but for what it is I can't seem to put it down it is just briliant.\n\nUpdate!/Edit\nHave played the lastest version of Consortium and all the bugs reported when the game first came out have a vanished, and say again this game deserves more attention then it has gotten it is a really brilliant game and the hard work the Devs have put in to fix it up and keep us updated is wonderful.

After reading a small chunk of the available lore, I had a better understanding of the game world, and found myself more engaged for it.\n\nOne thing that may turn off some players is that the game will not hold your hand.

This titles depth caught me by surprise as I missed the hype and only caught the game once it hit steam but even ignoring the then omnious warning from the developers about the games bugs and to avoid purchase, I decided to leap in and take a look, I mean, the devs seemed dedicated so why not, right? And now that most of those are sorted, the game is a real gem.\n\nI was delighted with a well scripted, although with some sometimes flat voice acting (perhaps intended?) well laid out plot options and some pretty amazing gameplay during the FPS style scenes. But it does not stop there either, there are so many differing gameplay elements built into the game and melded together so gracefully it's hard to not lace this review with spoilers but I will behave myself and let you enjoy the game for yourself.","March 13, 2014","true","8.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I can honestly say I had a great time with it, and can tell that the developers put a lot of time, effort, and heart into getting this indie creation to function like it does. I'd compare it favorably to the sections in MASS EFFECT where you just chat it up with your crew on the Normandy, learn a little bit about every one, affect their lives in little ways.\n\nIn CONSORTIUM, the crew is a lot less diverse (sometimes, I had trouble telling them apart), but the reactivity is absolutely fantastic. Going through the achievements, I can see so many different outcomes to choices that I made half-heartedly at the time. There's a lot of opportunity for replayablilty here. That is if you're on-board with the game's premise of spending 4-5ish hours getting to know its cast of characters in a confined flying command center.\n\nIf you love the dialog/choice-heavy sections of modern RPGs, here's a great little game that's built entirely around that. As someone who always puts points into charisma in RPGs (I know, I know), CONSORTIUM was right up my alley.\n\nIt's definitely not perfect. There are entire systems (inventory and ammo management) built around its very clunky combat mechanics, but I can only think of a few times when you have occasion to use your gun. You'll probably see more combat in the combat training scenario than in the rest of the game combined. It gives the impression of a game that's trying to "check a box" rather than make it a key part of the experience. It is a-okay to not have combat in a game like this. When CONSORTIUM was at its best, it reminded me of TITANIC: ADVENTURE OUT OF TIME. No combat, intriguing story, interesting characters, worthwhile investigation sections. An all-around great game.\n\nThere was also a bit of story-bending to an ARG that I didn't know existed, but apparently does. In the moment, I felt a little lost, like there was a crucial part of the story I was missing.\n\nOverall, really enjoyed my experience. Confined and relatively brief, though it was, the game is also very dense. I can easily see myself playing through this a couple more times to see different outcomes.

In some ways, the game feels like a tutorial level for a bigger game - the game teaches you how to manage your health and armor and use one of five weapons, with loading screen tutorial texts to match, but there's almost no actual combat in the game, amounting to a single optional firefight and some VR training missions. But it also uses this to have a somewhat interesting setting - the entire game takes place on an airship on the way to your next mission, and along the way you deal with a locked room murder mystery and unearth conspiracies. The gameplay is mostly dialogue-based with occasional bits of action, and the dialogue offers enough variety to highly encourage multiple playthroughs with the amount of choices you get and secrets to find. The dialogue is made interesting by the fact that rather than just breaking the fourth wall, Consortium doesn't really have a 4th wall to begin with, and the player is recognized in the game as a person using the game (described in-universe as a software that allows you to view the future through someone else's eyes) to control the main character in the future. This also ties into a pretty extensive ARG that leads up to the game for those who find themselves wanting more of the game's lore, and if you don't want to play the entire ARG there's a free DLC package that gives you all of the documents to clue you in, but it's a pretty substantial read, running several hundred pages of PDFs. The game can be enjoyed without ever acknowledging the ARG, however.\n\nConsortium is a game that feels like a smaller part of a bigger game while still holding its own as a standalone experience, and the next game, Consortium: The Tower, is currently in development and will presumably start off where this game ends. At the base price of $15 I'd consider Consortium to be a decent purchase, but at its current sale price of $1.50 I don't see any reason not to give it a try if you're into dialogue-based stories.","January 2","true","8.1"," 12 of 25 people (48%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","48","12","25","3","0"

There is a very interesting hierarchy in that group, as if each person was a chess piece. The game takes place in the aircraft of that outfit undergoing an assault from an enemy militia. Discussing with anyone lets the player choose how they respond (play dumb, flirt, and so on) and stand in a positive or negative way relative to each character. The dialogs are to me the meat of the game, quite interesting with well fleshed out characters.\n\nSadly, the First Person Shooting is so bad that I could not go much further in the game. Enemies have too much health and the combat is stiff and uninteresting. There are lots of opponents that can easily pin down the player (the combat takes place in an enclosed space), and it feels frustrating that such a bad shooting experience is also so difficult to overcome.\n\nOverall I think the game is an interesting and well written piece, but the FPS part is so badly executed that it prevents from appreciating the rest of the experience.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=666455279","April 16","false","3.2"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","7","15","0","0"

Sometimes text stacks over other text making it impossible to read.\n\nAnother problem there is NO indicator for alot of things. One exmaple was To find the "emergency weapons locker"\nNo npcs pointed at it, No npc walked towards it to show me where it was. I ended up trying to fist fight enemies with guns in a cramped maitenence tunnel. Can you guess who won?  Turns out in was in one of the dark corners and it was not obvious it was a weapons locker either. it looked a like a vent.\n\nI mean I grew up on old school games like the orginal doom, hexen, So i'm used to not having an obvious answer but when I can't tell a weapon's locker isn't a vent and have to click hump everything in a room tro find the weapons locker it's a problem. Yes you did that in doom to find hidden areas but this was a primary objective.  You shouldn't have to go "You said you had a primairy weapon lock you'd point me too, well take me too it!"\n\nthis was also after a "vr" training mission that gave me a gun it told me to use WITHOUT ANY AMMO.\n\nI really hate to not recommend this.This is one of those games that needs a third rating button. Specially since it does look like there was honest effort. I mean the music is amazing, the graphics are pretty, the voice acting is good but I can't. I just can't with how clumsy and buggy the gameplay is.\n\nI'm personally still going to try to get further into the game, maybe update the review once i've got more time but\nit is a frusstrating game and not in the fun way.","September 17, 2015","false","1.2"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","2"

The combat parts are a bit meh, but executed well enough and with a deliberate choise behind them, which makes it challenging to try and either incapacitate opponents or kill them.\n\nWhat really makes the game for me is a very interesting backstory and universe upon which you are inserted into. Plus the secret hints you can find lying around in various clues about the universe in which you are pushed into. A very neat mystery.\n\nSo if you are into a sci-fi detective/exploration story i would definitely recommend this game.","September 14, 2015","true","13.8"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

If a door opens once, don't expect it to open again by interacting with it from the exact same angle; go take a walk, come back and it will (hopefully) then open. Same with NPCs, even worse when you have to either incapacitate or heal them. Weapons behave weirdly and not very dynamic; the whole combat system doesn't feel very intuitive and up for the challenge; add to that the fact that this game is so poorly optmized that playing it gives me headaches.\n\nAlso, the lack of a map with objective marks makes for a hellishly infuriating experience, especially on missions where time is key for completion. How the hell am I supposed to know where all the rooms in the ship are by name? How can I know where I'm heading to? Also, how am I supposed to know I'm some sort of "time traveler" if there's no background explanation and no hint about it?\n\nSome of the dialog choices makes no sense, and seem to be more appropriate for end game rather than beginning.\n\nIt's a real shame that this game didn't really take off and they're basically giving it away at just about every indie game website. It had potential, and someone did put a lot of work into the story, and also the voice acting is quite decent.\n\nIt kind of angers me when part of a team puts in all the work, and the other half (usually made of unmotivated, uncaring, often inexperienced individuals) simply makes no effort to dish out a decent product.\n\nI cannot really NOT recommend it, but since Steam is so avant-garde as to offer reviewers the option to stay neutral (yes, sarcasm...), I'll have to say NO.\n\nSure get it if you like, but only for free like I did... or very, very cheap. No way it's worth 10 bucks.\n\nEDIT: I was just having another go, and five minutes in, I was hit by 3 NPCs chatting to me at the same time, with their voice-overs on top of each other. Made it impossible to know what answer to choose for one of them because I couldn't understand what was asked.\n\nEDIT 2: Hit by another bug, it happens when you manage to trap the traitor in one of the bedrooms or in the area that goes towards the medical bay: the traitor freezes up, doesn't move or shoot you, and both his health and stamina bar doesn't deplete as you keep shooting him, even after you depleted his armor. You have to get out of the way and let him go, so the combat resumes normally.","February 17","false","5.5"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

There is constant flashing, flickering, and shaking of the screen which, as far as I could find, cannot be turned off. While you're talking to one character, multiple conversations are going on the background so you can't hear a word anyone is saying. There are subtitles available, but they are horribly coded - the entirety of what the person is saying flashes on the screen all at once, then disappears line by line BEFORE the character is even finished reading the line. I get the idea of throwing you into a situation you're not prepared for and having you figure out what's going on, Quantum Leap style, but the game doesn't even tell you what most of the controls are. At one point, my quest flashed up on the screen, while at the same time, FOUR other pieces of text information flashed up, AND there was a disembodied voiceover telling me what I should be doing (on top of which, the background was occasionally flashing with a painful white light). Unable to process any of that since I didn't know what to focus on, suddenly ALL the informaion disappeared (other than the painful flashing, of course). I still had no idea what my quest was or even how to find out. Nothing is explained until way too late - fine for storytelling, BAD NEWS for gameplay. I could only tolerate about 30 minutes of this before I could feel myself going into sensory overload and had to turn it off. I've been playing video games my whole life and never once have I had that happen.\n\nIt's possible there is a great story and a really interesting game in there, but if you have ANY kind of sensory issues whatsoever, don't go anywhere near this one unless you're prepared to have a meltdown or a seizure, because you will.","February 10","false","0.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

I'll look for a place to report bugs and see if someone else has had the same issue. No crashes though and I like the amount of stuff I'm able to do.

I've waited for the final release of the game, for all the bugs to fix, and, unlike the other weird people, I reviewed the final release the game. Generally gameplay reminds me of System Shock 2, bit of Deus Ex and bit of first Half Life too. Speaking of Half Life, and fighting by the way, all the game can be finished without firing a single bullet - conversation is of course the most important thing here -  or of course you can fight your way through the game, and doing that be carefull when you firing grenades - you are in a pretty BIG aircraft, you know what I mean and yes - I tried this once and almost flew away through the hole i made :d Combat is though. Even on a easiest level, it's still challenging. But, I am sure that the great characters, interesting plot with many things to discover, (not through the first gameplay - i've played two times and everytime the game was MUCH different as I was choosing other options and deeds), a LOT of dialogues with a perfect voice acting and dubbing will convince you to check this out.\n\nPS. I don't care about how the game looks, Consortium is poor in graphics but pretty rich in other stuff. Go play Far Cry 3 if you want good looking games and don't even try this in that case.","May 24, 2014","true","11.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I would even go as far as to say the developers surpassed Telltale here. Screw Metascore this time. This game has the potential to be at least as great as Bioware's Mass Effect or Valve's own Half-Life.\n\nI can only semi-complain about the cliff-hanger at the end, so I must beg the developers to please actually release a second part, (Half-Life 3 anytime soon, Valve?)

And by "branching" I mean "be warned, your decisions and actions will *actually matter* in this game!", which already makes it rather unique.\n\nMovement through the certain areas of the ship tends to be a bit awkward, due to the realisticly cramped quarters, but the overall design is very well put together.  You will be challenged with the exploration and usage of the detailed "micro-environment" setting you find youself in, and forced to make quick descions based on instinct and whatever information you can glean from your surroundings or the NPCs.  Combat is not a huge portion of the game, though tends to be intense when it does happen.  As for the storyline... without giving away too much, it's about as twisty and complicated as they come, with a MASSIVE amount of backstory to flesh things out.\n\nOverall it's a good game with a unique design and plot, where one can wind up exploring a small yet incrediably detailed worldsetting.

Pacing of these interactions and the overall plot are not bad at all, and when combined with the setting deliver a game you can jump into and feel hooked. I personally enjoyed the voiceacting and sound design.\n\nAlright-Play length and amount of content to experience on a single playthrough leaves something to be desired, don't blow your horn about a trilogy if they're all going to be this quick and rely on multiple playthroughs to deliver full circle. Content is one thing, double handling gets old after awhile. I appreciate that we have many choices, but some of them lack follow through if you play certain types of characters. Sometimes there is no foothold for a player with too much intuition that will scour out of the way areas.\n\nLore dumps-the lore contained in this game is handcrafted and certainly interesting. The only problem outside of limited audio broadcasts/conversations is that if you want to experience any of it-have fun reading codex lore dumps in the menu. No offense but it was more fun to fly by the seat of my pants than do that and try to figure anything out, which seems to be a huge waste. Why gate so much great stuff behind one of the dullest interactions in your game?\n\nPlain bad-Shooting, Inventory management, sense of progression, jaggy shadows\n\nThis is a game worth playing but it feels at times if it is grasping for too many things to have that "feature list" that tends to accompany recent steam releases. The shooting is just plain bad(especially if you want to play non-killing), the hud sucks for it. If you want to play a decent shooter don't come into Consortium expecting even that. To make the matter worse any inventory management feels like it is there just to be there. Most of the items I encountered had no practical use inside the story, and anytime I did use a weapon/ammo/armor it was unintuitive, a huge hassle, and most of all not even fun. These two areas need some polish or even to be redone completely if you want to really tout them as cornerstones of the gameplay experience.\n\nWhich leads to my next point-progression. At the end of the day I felt like I made a difference, and was a set piece for some cool stuff. Even though I kept being swept along to the next issue there were a few "AHA" experiences in the plot or character interactions which left me wanting more. But you still feel very gated off from what is really happening, with few avenues to approach it in an otherwise very thoughtful and ambitious setup.\n\nAlso the shadow jaggies are downright terrible, expect them to be a bit jarring even if you have a nicer PC.\n\nMy final comments will be aimed at the developer review-you need to decide on what you want and get it right the first time, and budget the appropriate timelines and resources to it. There is a vocal audience that bought into this game when it released, and you can tell they felt let down by the compromises and changes you made to the content and schedule. I can believe how buggy the initial playthroughs probably were. You can't look back and say "Well I should have done it that way" or "Well we have this awesome system, but the way it was presented in the first game didn't suit it well"\n\nI don't say this to be harsh, but to let you know those were both areas of your responsibility during game production, and to say it didn't work or wasn't presently appropriately falls on you. It is easy to say how you would change past design decisions or player encounters at the end of the day, for obvious reasons. Perhaps a wiser approach towards future projects would be to set clear, concise goals on how to approach past issues while being mindful of what worked well.","December 26, 2014","true","6.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Pacing of these interactions and the overall plot are not bad at all, and when combined with the setting deliver a game you can jump into and feel hooked. I personally enjoyed the voiceacting and sound design.\n\nAlright-Play length and amount of content to experience on a single playthrough leaves something to be desired, don't blow your horn about a trilogy if they're all going to be this quick and rely on multiple playthroughs to deliver full circle. Content is one thing, double handling gets old after awhile. I appreciate that we have many choices, but some of them lack follow through if you play certain types of characters. Sometimes there is no foothold for a player with too much intuition that will scour out of the way areas.\n\nLore dumps-the lore contained in this game is handcrafted and certainly interesting. The only problem outside of limited audio broadcasts/conversations is that if you want to experience any of it-have fun reading codex lore dumps in the menu. No offense but it was more fun to fly by the seat of my pants than do that and try to figure anything out, which seems to be a huge waste. Why gate so much great stuff behind one of the dullest interactions in your game?\n\nPlain bad-Shooting, Inventory management, sense of progression, jaggy shadows\n\nThis is a game worth playing but it feels at times if it is grasping for too many things to have that "feature list" that tends to accompany recent steam releases. The shooting is just plain bad(especially if you want to play non-killing), the hud sucks for it. If you want to play a decent shooter don't come into Consortium expecting even that. To make the matter worse any inventory management feels like it is there just to be there. Most of the items I encountered had no practical use inside the story, and anytime I did use a weapon/ammo/armor it was unintuitive, a huge hassle, and most of all not even fun. These two areas need some polish or even to be redone completely if you want to really tout them as cornerstones of the gameplay experience.\n\nWhich leads to my next point-progression. At the end of the day I felt like I made a difference, and was a set piece for some cool stuff. Even though I kept being swept along to the next issue there were a few "AHA" experiences in the plot or character interactions which left me wanting more. But you still feel very gated off from what is really happening, with few avenues to approach it in an otherwise very thoughtful and ambitious setup.\n\nAlso the shadow jaggies are downright terrible, expect them to be a bit jarring even if you have a nicer PC.\n\nMy final comments will be aimed at the developer review-you need to decide on what you want and get it right the first time, and budget the appropriate timelines and resources to it. There is a vocal audience that bought into this game when it released, and you can tell they felt let down by the compromises and changes you made to the content and schedule. I can believe how buggy the initial playthroughs probably were. You can't look back and say "Well I should have done it that way" or "Well we have this awesome system, but the way it was presented in the first game didn't suit it well"\n\nI don't say this to be harsh, but to let you know those were both areas of your responsibility during game production, and to say it didn't work or wasn't presently appropriately falls on you. It is easy to say how you would change past design decisions or player encounters at the end of the day, for obvious reasons. Perhaps a wiser approach towards future projects would be to set clear, concise goals on how to approach past issues while being mindful of what worked well.","December 26, 2014","true","6.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Good writing, good characterization, and good voice acting come together to make a solid piece of video game storytelling. There are plenty of permutations in the story to justify multiple playthroughs, and your choices genuinely affect the way the story plays out. Considering the fact that there are so few games like this that focus on player choice, it's good to not only see it released, but to see that it is done very well, and in a unique way. For this alone, I would recommend the game.\n\nThough the game contains combat, there isn't very much of it. This is a bit odd considering how much detail they tried to put into the system. In the higher difficulty levels, individual parts of your suit and body can be damaged, and you can repair/heal those specific parts. There's even an inventory system, wherein you can trade energy (which is used for repairs and energy weapons) for physical space to carry guns, ammo, etc.\n\nDespite this level of detail, it isn't particularly polished. The AI spews fire everywhere while running around like headless chickens, and the inventory system is more annoying than it's really worth. The creators of the game either had a grander vision than they were able to actually execute, or they are just trying to establish the skeleton of the combat system for the future titles.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the combat isn't unplayable or unfun, it's just nothing particularly special. This is not a AAA FPS.\n\nIt's also worthy to note that, when this game was first released, it had several game-breaking bugs. However, the vast majority of the bugs have been mopped up now, and I have had no trouble since the first few patches they released to fix the major bugs.","January 16, 2015","true","27.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

First playthrough expect to spend *alot* of time in the dark, literally and metaphorically. Some objectives are very vague, some are so easy to fail simply because you didn't notice something, some seem to be impossible to pass.\nExamples, I was told to "defend the crew", shot or incapacitated maybe 8 attackers, 2 of them standing infront of a wall yelling but not moving, searched the entire plane and couldn't find anyone else, objective is still the same 15 mins later. Ummm... huh? Reload game from the last auto save, this time 12 attackers where I found the first 8 and I move on. Okay so major bugs in that mission that they didn't fix.\nAnother mission I am supposed to rescue the pilot when he is at risk of being electrocuted. Objective says to go through the access point in the cockpit. I do that and people are yelling "help him! quick! get out of there!" I look around, it's a small room with an access door that I came through and a door to the infirmary where some of the people are yelling, but the door is locked. I think "okay, they already got him to the infirmary and I am supposed to go there. I go back through the cockpit and people really freak out. "Go back in there and help him!" Except now the access point is locked. Oooookay? what was that about? Second playthrough I find out he is in the corner of that small room. That would have been nice to know before you wasted my time.\nAnother easy to fail mission because they didn't make things clear, those 8 attackers that I said I found in that mission? That was technically my second time playing that mission. the first time I was told to follow a crew member to a weapons lockup. she walks 20 feet and a door opens, she turns and looks at me, I walk through the door, it closes and locks behind me. Huh? she didn't follow? where are my weapons? The objectives just read "protect the crew" and tell me to go to the hanger bay. I go there, unarmed, and think alright I'm supposed to knock out an attacker and take his gun. nope, punching them does nothing. I spend another 5 mins searching for that mysterious weapons catch I was promised, no where to be found. Reload, Oh! she was walking up to (and blocking) a small panel built into the wall with some weapons, and I'm not supposed to go through the door, just wait until she opens it. lame.\nFinally a mission that I'm apparently not supposed to succeed? I'm supposed to convince the pilot that there is a virus in the system. Ok, easy! Except when I get the mission I am standing next to the cockpit door and it is locked. A woman walks in and locks it behind her again. You can see through a "window" to one side and they are making out, they tell you to go away and there is nothing else to do. The woman doesn't come out until you leave the area, and when you return the pilot is already down below where he gets electrocuted, so you are notified that you failed the mission. Oookay? So why is that even a mission?\nOh yeah, so as for being in the dark literally, for some reason you spend at least 30% of the game in near or total darkness because the lights are malfunctioning. As you can imagine, that makes it a bit difficult to navigate the ship, especially with out a map, since sometimes you have no idea if you are even moving or just stuck at a poorly made doorway that you have to walk at just right to walk through.\nNow a word on game length. I've played through twice. 7 hours on record. The first playthrough took over 5 irritating hours of being left in the dark wondering "what am I supposed  to be doing?" Which means the second playthrough, now that I know what I'm doing, only took 2 hours even though I tried different options and unlocked some things that either weren't available or simply bugged during the first playthrough.\nFinally, the game has a few bugs. Some of them irrelevant, like the pilot saying that he is going to check some systems, you go into the cockpit and he is sitting in the air acting like he is pushing buttons 5 feet from his chair. Some of the glitches halt your progress, like the 2 enemies staring at and pointing their guns at the wall while yelling at you then nobody else shows up and you can't move on.\n\nOverall, a terrible game. I'll try it once or twice more to make sure I'm not missing something major that caused others to give this game a high rating, but it looks like it's a waste of time.","April 11","false","9.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The game systems look like they have a lot of potential, but most of it is wasted given that you'll spend the vast majority of your time in this short game wandering around the plane talking to people. There is very little combat outside of the in-game simulator so you never really get to take advantage of the combat system at all. The story just kind of ends rather abruptly right when you think the game is about to really get going.\n\nThis game has options for using a gamepad on the main menu, but not all of the in-game menus support the controller (most notably the inventory), and some critical buttons aren't even mapped so you still need a keyboard to play the game.\n\nThe silver lining in all this is that they're already working on what is episode 2 to continue the story and hopefully start realizing the potential of what they have here.\n\nGiven the reasonable price and the potential of this series, I can tentatively recommend it, but be aware that this feels very much like an unfinished game.","April 17","true","5.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

First playthrough expect to spend *alot* of time in the dark, literally and metaphorically. Some objectives are very vague, some are so easy to fail simply because you didn't notice something, some seem to be impossible to pass.\nExamples, I was told to "defend the crew", shot or incapacitated maybe 8 attackers, 2 of them standing infront of a wall yelling but not moving, searched the entire plane and couldn't find anyone else, objective is still the same 15 mins later. Ummm... huh? Reload game from the last auto save, this time 12 attackers where I found the first 8 and I move on. Okay so major bugs in that mission that they didn't fix.\nAnother mission I am supposed to rescue the pilot when he is at risk of being electrocuted. Objective says to go through the access point in the cockpit. I do that and people are yelling "help him! quick! get out of there!" I look around, it's a small room with an access door that I came through and a door to the infirmary where some of the people are yelling, but the door is locked. I think "okay, they already got him to the infirmary and I am supposed to go there. I go back through the cockpit and people really freak out. "Go back in there and help him!" Except now the access point is locked. Oooookay? what was that about? Second playthrough I find out he is in the corner of that small room. That would have been nice to know before you wasted my time.\nAnother easy to fail mission because they didn't make things clear, those 8 attackers that I said I found in that mission? That was technically my second time playing that mission. the first time I was told to follow a crew member to a weapons lockup. she walks 20 feet and a door opens, she turns and looks at me, I walk through the door, it closes and locks behind me. Huh? she didn't follow? where are my weapons? The objectives just read "protect the crew" and tell me to go to the hanger bay. I go there, unarmed, and think alright I'm supposed to knock out an attacker and take his gun. nope, punching them does nothing. I spend another 5 mins searching for that mysterious weapons catch I was promised, no where to be found. Reload, Oh! she was walking up to (and blocking) a small panel built into the wall with some weapons, and I'm not supposed to go through the door, just wait until she opens it. lame.\nFinally a mission that I'm apparently not supposed to succeed? I'm supposed to convince the pilot that there is a virus in the system. Ok, easy! Except when I get the mission I am standing next to the cockpit door and it is locked. A woman walks in and locks it behind her again. You can see through a "window" to one side and they are making out, they tell you to go away and there is nothing else to do. The woman doesn't come out until you leave the area, and when you return the pilot is already down below where he gets electrocuted, so you are notified that you failed the mission. Oookay?

It's difficult to find much wrong with it now that they've meticulously patched it, fixing all the performance issues and irritating bugs.\nThis is possibly the first game I've played where the characters seem like real people with real relationships that really matter. You feel as though you're really leaving an impression on them as you attempt to solve the myriad mysteries of Zenlil, the futuristic plane, while a conspiracy of powers you can't hope to understand weaves its web below the surface. I'm even a big fan of the graphic style, which brings back nostalgic memories of 90s CG television shows like Reboot. Who knew flat-shaded textures could have such a charm to them?\nWhile it wraps itself in the guise of a first-person-shooter, Consortium is a conversational game first and foremost, with almost every encounter with danger solvable without needing to resort to circle-strafing and machine-gunning. As such it can be a more sedate experience than you're comfortable with if you're looking for a more conventional FPS. I'd very much recommend it to people who are more inclined towards adventure games and other more story-based genres.\nWith how open-ended the game is and how many ways you can alter and affect the timeline, I reckon I'll be giving Consortium a bunch more playthroughs before the next installment.\nA+ - Very Recommended.","April 30, 2014","true","7.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

CONSORTIUM is an outstanding example of how immersive storytelling can be accomplished, with decisions and impacts that really matter.\n\nA quick example: forgetting to charge your energy reserves before meeting with your boss can determine whether or not a crew member dies....  Not because it's scripted that way, but because you have to run to need energy reserves in order to inject a wounded crew member with healing nanites.  And if you aren't prepared, they bleed out before you get back.\n\nThere are numerous other instances that truly inspire that this game is indeed another universe, that the characters are living, coping, and otherwise dealing with the stress of being in a tense military situation.\n\nSadly, the graphics do not live up to this - The game went for a slightly cartoony look instead of a realistic look.  That said, it works well with the chosen art style, and it isn't the visual art that makes the game.  It's the audio, the writing, and the humanoid interactions and reactions.\n\nThe game is a little short for what I was hoping (was able to fully complete 1 variant of the story in 2 hours), but it has quite a bit of variation and replayability based on what you do and don't do.\n\nTL;DR - Highly recommended if you want a story-driven adventure game that doesn't rely on logic puzzles or item gimmicks.  Plus, its story is awesomely meta.","April 30, 2014","true","2.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Not that you should, that does not seem to be its main purpose in the game. The main purpose is really sort of exploring this alterntive universe, I do not consider myself to be a particularly heavily story-driven person, but having said that, you're not ramshackled to a ball and chain to the story. If you want to breeze through it as quickly as possible, you can. If you want to know this story better than anyone else, IDGI doesn't stop you.\n\nMy Main gripe over the game ended up being the level layout and its room naming. I think it would be safe to say that I probably should have put more attention into looking at the map on the second floor, but with timed events, save-scumming is the only way to progress.","March 16","true","5.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/standingaround/recommended/264240/","standingaround","Meowt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/standingaround/","114 products in account","CONSORTIUM: A very Interesting "game" For starters, the game  does not  consider what it does as a "game", simply more of a mix between time travel and the matrix. The game begins with the simple and not soul crushing experience of  "THIS IS NOT A GAME, THESE ARE REAL PEOPLE AND REAL LIVES" (Really gets ya hyped up doesnt it?) and puts you into the "game" (You'll be seeing me use the term "game" throughout the review, simply because the game does not consider itself as a game, more simply "an experience")\nVISUALSSolid, runs off the source engine yet even through its source I get a somewhat decent framerate (averaging about 20 or so in a crowded section of the map) which is odd. Sure the game is new but in slightly older games (say, Portal 2 for an example, solely because it too is a source engine game) I got a wonderful amount of framerate (Averaging a 32 to 60 on my "crap-top") but graphics seem to be a major issue to me. even on the lowest setting and at a ridiculously low resolution the game still runs poorly, Definently would not recommend for older PCs.\nGAMEPLAYLike almost all source engine games, the gameplay was solid. I had fun and generally was interested in the plot (Which i will not spoil because reasons and even i'm not done with it at the time I wrote this review). I rarely encountered a game breaking bug or glitch ( the worst being when an NPC didn't spawn in the VR training section) It was fun but still challenging to an extent. The story(Though i like it cause y'know, i'm a major nerd for all thing futuristic) seems somewhat bland at first. Imagine the largest, Most chaotic and futuristic game of clue you can think of. Got it? Now add in EMPs, Rockets, US F-16s, an angry slavic man and then throw it all up at about the cruising altitide of a Boeing 747.\nBecause that is essentially CONSORTIUM.\nVALUEIs it worth the $10 that Interdimensional Games is asking for?\nSadly no, I (like many others) had picked up the "game" for free as part of the steam winter sale when this "game" came out. An asking price for a story that (Though very long) is rather mediocre shouldn't really be this high (though i should point out that the replay value of this game is totally amazeballs[thats right, amazeballs]) I would have been happy to pay the $10 in truth though, because c'mon guys. There is so much worse you could get for more than $10(Garfeild Karts anyone?)\n\nFINAL VERDICTI'd give it a 7/1110, The game is Solid in terms of gameplay and originality but is lacking in storytelling and plot\nOverall, CONSORTIUM is a truely great game. The mechanics used in the game are (as stated by the game) truely ground breaking. When i played it it felt like every choice I made had a reaction, had a consequence and I even felt regret for one.\nPick up the game some time if you like Action RPGs and want to try something new","March 16","true","3.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The fps is so low and the game is laggy most of the time that I've started over a few times and there is audio lag as well, almost sounds like an electrical device is making sparks and about to blow up at times. It's pretty annoying to buy a title that says its complete only to not be able to play it because the frame rate is so bad and makes it completely unenjoyable, this is coming from someone who plays all his games jacked up to the highest settings most of the time, its happening to other people with good rigs too, so its bad optimization and I hope it gets fixed so I can try to play and enjoy the game to its fullest, honestly though it says I have 3 hours of game time, I really only have an hour at most because of restarts after messing with the settings and doing vr training over several times where the lag jumps from bad to really really bad (any combat for that matter). Based on other reviews as well as posts I've read there are plenty of other bugs as well which I haven't ran into all of them yet because I haven't played that much of it yet because of what I said above. Changing settings to the lowest makes no difference in performance either, in fact it may have even gotten worse. Hoping someone comes up with a fix or the devs get it patched asap because its in a horrible state right now for me as well as others. Like I said I think its a great game but I'm not sure yet, haven't been able to invest any time into it.  Couple of other things I've noticed bug wise and just not liking wise is the first mission where you defend you ship with a gun (shooter part) and kill all the enemies, well I think they just constantly respawn, I passed the mission but even when it said I had completed the mission and to come back to the command center there were enemies shooting me and I died several times right there because the game created a save point right in the middle of this chaos so I would spawn in the middle of getting shot on my ship (mission already achieved) and friendly fire was turned on on my gun because I completed the mission so I couldnt even shoot back at the respawning enemies lol, it was ridiculous, so basically I just sprinted out of the room and left them to do whatever they did, leave the ship I assume. Also during that time I noticed the main bad guy at that time whom I already killed and was lying down on the ground dead, there was another one of him shooting at me and running around so that was jacked up as well and was not normal. Another couple of things I dislike so far is when I give my opinion or input on a subject we're discussing, whether it be not to move a body because its a crime scene or suggesting we attack etc they just blow you off and do whatever they want, so far you have no power in the game, you are just a long for the ride and told what to do though it starts as if you're the leader etc and there is some sort of military ranking system used but with pieces from a chess game from pawn to king, you play a bishop and there was a moment where a pawn just talked with total disrespect right to my face and I couldn't do ♥♥♥♥ about it and the knight which is apparently the leader says oh I tell everyone to speak their mind etc, its really annoying and she is the most unliked character so far because she's so passive about everything and you can't make a damn decision to save your life, cause they ignore any suggestions you make etc. Maybe that'll change but that's what its like so far.","January 9, 2014","false","4.2"," 8 of 18 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","8","18","0","4"

The dialogue and voice acting are so unbareably cliche, awkward, and cheesy, that I don't think I could stand to listen to any character anymore than I already have in the short amount of time that I've played. This is the biggest hurdle I'm unwilling to over come in order to continue playing, the second being that for how bad the voice acting is, there is an incredible amount of dialogue for the opening and I'm sat here thinking, "Just get on with it." The fact that replayability is advertised at the beginning of the game combined with my previous complaints really makes me want to not get invested. Interesting premise, but this isn't for me, or anyone who can't stomach boring and generic dialogue, cliched and overused accents, and a very slow start to the game.","December 3, 2015","false","0.7"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

Load times are outright painful (plenty long enough for a full trip to the head). The game lag makes combat nearly impossible. Not bad enough to ask for a refund at 80% off, but close.\n\nAn excellent concept, poorly executed.\n\nUPDATE:\n\n1. OK, I finished the game in 5.5 hours. It's really NOT a game, it's a LONG DEMO. If you pay full price for this game, your're going to feel Really Ripped Off. I paid $2.99, and that's about what CONSORTIUM is worth. Not horrible, just not good enough.\n2. My machine can play DCS World at just below maximum settings. To run CONSORTIUM I had to turn Everything on my computer off (no other game I play requires that). When I posted the review above, the developer, Thrie, very kindly looked into it and said my graphics card wasn't up to minimums. I'm very sorry, but CONSORTIUM is not a photo-realistic simulator like DCS, it is, to put it politely, a glorified cartoon. I don't how many pixels they slaughtered to make this game such a huge graphics hog, but it doesn't show up in the end product.\n3. CONSORTIUM is Very Talky and never really delivers or even makes sense (reminds me of far too many dates I've been on).\n4. Even with every other program on my PC shut down, the load times are like Chinese water torture.\n5. I stick by my initial judgment; CONSORTUM is a brilliant concept, poorly executed.

Sure it had its perks, but in the long run, I felt like I was ripped off. Like really? 3 hours of gameplay?\n\nThe gameplay itself is O.K. seeing that it mostly teases you with some 'fps combat' that you never get to do. The graphics are O.K. They get the job done, and don't look too ugly. The music in the game is very well done, but I feel was wasted on a game thats literaly three hours long. Anyways, moving on to the story, [SPOILERS] you play as a timetravaler using a sattalite made by none-other than the developer of the game (Self-centered?). You use this sattalite to controll the charectar 'Bishop-Six' who is apart of the crew of the ship Zenlil. Bishop-Six is basically a warrior class on the ship (but you dont get to do anything). blah blah blah, the game teases you with more garbage that you can't actually use, then you engage in your first real combat scenario... where you don't have to do anything.... You either surrener or die. After this, the game tries to delay you for quite a bit so you cannot complete your objective, then brings up a really story-killing arc... Your first mission is to kill Osama Bin-Laden's son.... REALLY. They couldn't have come up with something  a little better?

It is both a game, and an interactive art piece. And deserves to be looked at in terms of each.\nAs a game, Consortium is incredibly forgettable. The animations are jerky, the graphics are dated, and the bugs are frequent and irritating. There are a lot of interesting ideas there re: combat, with customisable loadouts that change how you play. And besides one possible battle there's not really anywhere in the game where combat exists, outside of the VR training sim. Which is a shame.\n\nAs a piece of art, it walks the line between being a meaningful experience and pretentious. Unfortunately this one falls on the side of being pretentious. It has a "play this game a thousand times with tiny variations to see all it has to offer" rhetoric, which would be fine if the game part worked well. But it doesn't. And attempting to experience other parts of the story through the experience of others actually gets censored by the developers on the steam forums. Want to know who the murderer was, but can't piece it together? Play the game repeatedly until you find out! No thanks devs, just let someone else tell me what I've missed. That's MY choice, not yours; thinking otherwise shows that the developers have no real understanding about creating art for the consumption of others.\n\nConsortium gets the concept right, but the execution is not quite there. It is ultimately a forgettable experience that is begging for someone else to take the core idea and do it justice. Not worth buying, not worth playing. Skip it.","January 14, 2015","false","4.5"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

But... I don't know. Once the sequel comes out it might be worth it.\n\nBasically, it's 5 hours of walking around and talking to people with conversation trees that aren't clear what their outcomes will be. You will think you know the right response and NOPE, they'll get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at you. But is it REALLY your fault? Maybe... or maybe it's the hit-and-miss voice acting, script, and dialog.\n\nAnd the conversations wouldn't be so bad if everyone wasn't EXTREMELY similiar looking. And using NUMBERS AND NAMES to separate everyone? That's horrible! People have both a Callsign AND a name, and people use them interchangably (So you have to learn both!) and the ship has like 20-30 people so you don't even begin to recognize names until a few hours in. At that point, the game is 90% over. Moreover, the conversations move (even with subtitles on) WAY TOO FAST.\n\nI ABSOLUTELY support the indie devs for reaching for the stars. But the actual gameplay is 5 hours of that "5 minute period" of most games where you wait for the actual action and fun to begin.\n\nThey have an entire "combat system" that... and I can't believe I'm even saying this... that you never actually use. I went through the entire game with ONE BATTLE. ONE. FREAKING. BATTLE. Why even have an inventory system? Why have me manage and decide what weapon to use?\n\nThe game is very hard to pin down. It makes it very difficult to naturally feel and understand WHAT the game is asking you to do. It's a game that you have to play to the end before you realize any of the boundaries and scope of the game. That's great if you want to make the world "seem" huge and beyond what you actually play in. Gemini Rue did that BEAUTIFULLY. But when done wrong, it leaves the player feeling very unsure and constantly "thinking" (more like guessing) about what he's doing.\n\nThis game is a GREAT EXPERIMENT from a new group. But it's also a deeply flawed experiment. So I both applaud them, and look forward to the sequel, but I can't really recommend the average person to play it.\n\nIf the game is cheap, it's WORTH risking a couple of bucks to support these guys. But if you're strapped for cash, and don't like flawed-but-original games, I wouldn't recommend this.\n\n...\n\nOH, and I also had to turn on cheats (which disables all achievements) to pass a certain section. The game has an area that constantly hurts you over time, the bug makes it kill you so fast it's impossible to pass without god mode.","April 7","false","4.5"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

It has enough going for it to warrant a reccomendation, but it comes with some warnings.\nBoth the writing, and the graphical fidelity are pretty decent; from what I've seen so far there isn't anything that stands out too starkly as cheap looking or terrible sounding. The characters, while overly perky to the point of mild irritation are voiced well and move smoothly more or less.\n\nIf you don't like stories where the game talks freely about it being a game and breaks the 4th wall while attempting to work such breaches into the lore itself, then this isnt for you. It's quirky and funny but it can come off as a bit trying and boring at times.\n\nThe UI, on the other hand looks like it was made in flash, or paint or something and isn't all that great and is fairly confusing to navigate, especially in combat. Equipment is also sort of oddly priced. For some reason your basic armor you get at the beginning of the game costs 72 MILLION dollars yet your helmet - of equal technical complexity- costs a mere 75k.\n\nCombat feels wierdly tacked on. Your suit is essentially this big vaccum cleaner that just sucks up EVEYRTHING and converts it into 'utility energy' This is then used for healing and weapons, but has modes where you can just passively heal/repair or repair/heal specific parts of your body. It's just unecessarily complicated and does not really translate well to the general flow of combat.\n\nEnemies have a similar system although here the complexity is welcomed and you can maim them in a variety of ways rather than just killing them outright. I personally like this because it makes combat more interesting and engaging than simply pointing and clicking.\n\nThose small nitpicks aside, I would say that this game is certainly worth it with a 10 buck price tag, so wait for it to go on sale.","January 9, 2014","true","1.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Mystery is abound, secrets and a lot of lore.\n\nThe game is simple, you are allowed to try out a machine that not only let's you go to the near future, but take the mind of someone there. So who is the subject of this new futristic mind control, a peace keeper enforcer with armor and weapons costing billions of dollars. Let that sink in.\n\nOf course, being stuck in that role, you have not damn clue what is going on. So you right there, you can replay the game if you want. What's even more intresting is that you have the option to say nothing, at all. So points right there for true neutrals out there.\n\nThe major plot is simple, there is a murder and a traitor onboard, as well as mercs who are out to destroy the plane. All while you hear voices in your head, an archive lore that you can read or not.\n\nGameplay:\n\nGameplay is solid but shallow. The combat works, but you barely use it, unless you test the simulation mode out. The interactive interface is good, but with everything glitching on purpose, you are force to pull yourself out again and again as you can't handle everything.\n\nCharacter interaction is based on points. Say things the right way and you get favor, ♥♥♥♥ them off vice versa. This doesn't mean much unless you are after achivements or just want to. Either way, you do get options where you can do peaceful alternatives, or blow stuff up.  Overall my first run was 'play by the rules' cop, and then I went renegade on my next.\n\n\nStory:\n\nBy far, the major pushing force. It's a classic murder mystery, just in the future. The game really wants to make you think one guy is the killer. All I will say is think with your head, use proper deduction, and keep trying.\n\nThe story features some solid lore on a master AI, political issues, and even hints of a great war and cultist inthe background. I am kind of angry that it was so short, because I am dying for more.\n\n\nMusic:\n\nMusic flowed well. Proper timing and good score made sure that I can listen to this even after the game is over. I enjoyed it and really did put some epic feelings in what you do.\n\n\nOverall: Should you play CONSORTIUM?\n\nIf you like a good murder mystery, dialogue, decent voice acting and story that is also complimented by a great score. Then YES.\n\nIf you feel you can't handle this game being too short and with a big fat " To be continued." Then I would advise to move on.","July 13, 2015","true","5.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The dialogue is good; replayability is decent; and your choices do matter. The game, however, provides absolutely no closure. It should be called "Consortium: Chapter 1" as far as I'm concerned. The game is plain short, since it covers a single day of events. Also, as other people have mentioned, the ending is a major cliff hanger. Just as you get excited about the plot the game just ends. And it's going to take some time for the developer to put the second one out.\n\nI recommend this game because I did enjoy the plot development and the dialogue but to the folks that wonder if the game's worth their money I'd say to wait until the next part comes out, just to see whether the devs live up to the expectations.","July 28, 2015","true","8.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Voice acting and music is top notch, especially for an indie game. That said, I couldn't help but feel as if the game were just a demo of something bigger. Don't get me wrong the game has plenty of hours of playtime in it but during a lot of it you aren't really playing with all of the cool gadgets and concepts that are advertised on the in game consoles and in dialogue. After the first real combat situation I picked up a bunch of extra hardpoint modules for my suit and... you never use them again. I also felt that the ending sequences felt a bit "phoned in".\n\nI think the key positive in this game is that there are a TON of threads you can explore with each situation (and even sub-situations inside those situations!). Many RPG/FPS/Adventure hybrids give you two or three choices in a few situations in the game. The lazier ones just give you 3 choises at the end and call it a day. Consortium has TONS of choices presented at almost every turn. I have to respect the amount of design that had to go into that.\n\nObviously it was meant to have a sequel and hopefully the sequel will take what made Consortium great and expand upon it much more. I hate to be one of the people complaining that it didn't have enough action in it and ordinarily that wouldn't matter in an adventure game... but the action they did have was GOOD! So they should definitely capitalise on it in the future.","August 28, 2015","true","8.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Be aware that you're buying what is about equal to one "episode" of an episodic game in terms of length for your 15 bucks, so get it when it's on sale like I did. This game feels like stepping into the life of a high ranking officer on the Enterprise, it's a lot of fun while it lasts. Your decisions sometimes have a vissible affect on events, though it seems more like they're funneling into the sequel. With interesting characters and a good plot, I'd recommend playing this if you can get it cheap. But I really wish they'd release the sequel as free for those who bought the first, or at least super cheap, because otherwise there simply isn't 15 bucks worth of content here.

If you pay full price, currently $16.99 - you'll be extremely disappointed. You've been warned.\n\nWith that said, for $3.39, which I paid, it was worth the 4 hours it took to complete. It's a neat idea, well crafted and it's clear the devs put a LOT of time into this game. I can honestly say it could stretch easily into 7-8 hours if you're reading every single piece of information to its full extent, and attempting (without the use of google) to achieve every secondary quest. But in the end it just didnt feel worth it.\n\nOverall it just doesnt feel like the game is complete - apparently there is a talk of a trilogy with this game, and yes there is the option of replayability - but it wasn't really good enough the first time around that I'd waste another 4 hours just to see the minute changes that can occur with some different choices.\n\nSome people might love it, you might hate it - but its worth playing if you've got some time to waste, and it's less than a 5'er...","September 11, 2015","true","4.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

This is one of the best sci-fi games i have ever played! All i knew about it going in was that it was a real-time adventure with multiple paths, which is why it's been sitting on my "to play" queue for months - who has time for replaying multiple paths just to get the most out of a game? Well, i've just completed my first playthrough and it was an insanely well-realized story, even just once through. But, much like Life is Strange, the meta-game explicitly encourages you to try different approaches. Perhaps it will be the first time i actually do go back to a game just to play another path.\n\nEssentially it is a first-person narrative adventure, with a few FPS elements. You are thrown in completely blind, teased with reams of world-building text in the information console, but immediately confronted with situations and dialogs that push you to skip it with absolutely no idea what's going on. As you start to learn the story, there are a few clues that lead you back to that wall of text, and the story is so ♥♥♥♥ing intriguing by then that it no longer feels like a chore at all. The characters are believable, the mythology is one of the richest i have ever seen in a video game and the whole experience is great.\n\nIf there's one thing i didn't like, it's the FPS segments. These days i am much more into stealth and skillful one-shot-kills, but the shooting segments here are oldskool Doomguy bullet-sponge strafe-em-ups. Fortunately it seems there is only one of these, plus some training missions. The storyline is truly great, though, and totally makes the shooting worthwhile. Could it be better than Gemini Rue? Yes. Better than Mass Effect? A million times yes. Better than Deus Ex? Almost. Probably. If you like science fiction you owe it to yourself to play this game right now. Don't sit on it.

You play as the new security officer on a commandship tasked with monitoring global security. It goes a bit deeper than that, you are part of a mysterious time warp experiment who happens to take the body of the new security officer. Soon there is a murder on board and ransomers outside and you have to deal with the situation. Clues start adding up and you really wonder who is behind the conspiracy, what do they want from you, do they know your secret?\nThe developers really went all out in the writing and voice acting of this game. The characters all have their own personalities, quirks and back stories so you really feel like you are a part of a team. They go about their work day throughout the ship.  You can follow them and see what secrets they are hiding or you can joke around with them. I began to like these people and actually felt bad when I tried to do a jerk playthrough.\nThere is a combat simulator on board and two optional combat situations.\nIt is very short, the game world moves on with or without you so there is no real down time. Things happen fast so the game isnt long. Its worth multiple playthroughs tho and I enjoy the atmosphere. Plus there are from 3-4 responses to dialogue and the writers really fleshed it out so there are a lot of options to explore.\nSo if you want to take an afternoon to become an officer on a space ship, meet some new friends (or enemies), solve a murder and shoot some badies then I highly recommend this game.

Infact, it's actually really good.\nAlthough, one thing that undertale takes advantage to in this game, is that it has a satisfying ending, that is actually an ending, if you do it right, and multiple nonsatisfying/terrifying endings if you don't. This game, it all leads up to one confusing sequel bait, "To be continued". It even says so itself. I'm not joking. At the very least the new game they're making (Of which's kickstarter will be avaliable on the 18th) looks pretty interesting.\nBut let's put it all in a list:\nPROS:\n+Good story. It confused me at the start, but kept me interested and immersed until the end.\n+Very interesting and realistic characters and reactions.\n+"Say nothing". It's about time that a game with dialogue, I am now able to say absolutely nothing when I have absolutely nothing to say. Or when there's nothing that I want to say.\n+ In all honesty, I think that the combat is fairly nice. Nothing special, just, nice. I had alot of fun in the VR tutorials.\n+The ship is laid out like a bloody ship.\n+The voice acting is top notch from the characters I've heard.\n+ Chess pieces. I like chess pieces.\n+ Your armor looks cool.\n+ It's, VERY immersive. Seriously.\n+Choices.\nAlright, you can probably tell that I'm running out of things to say, but that doesn't mean it's a bad game. I'm just running out of things to say. Most of these pros outweigh the mixed points and cons.\nMIXED POINTS\n*Admittedly, I think the dialogue is kinda limited. You use the first four function keys, function 4 always being "say nothing". It's not nearly as bad as it was in Fallout 4, but it's still kind of limited. However, for the most part, I don't see there needing any more dialogue options, so yeah.\n*Also, the dialogue system can be quite clunky for some, as there is the fear of pressing the wrong button, not knowing if you pressed the wrong button, and actually pressing the wrong button, and if you are using a controller, I don't know how you would be able to press anything. But I haven't tried it with a controller. So I'm not sure.\n*The graphics, are, well, I don't have that good of a machine, so I can't really complain about it too much, but they aren't the greatest in the world. But in my eyes, unless they are eyesoaringly ugly, I don't think graphics matter all that much.\n*Oh. I thought this was going to be in space.\n*The UI is pretty wierd. I'm one who despises Cyan, and despises it's use in Science fiction games, and despises hologram UI, but that's an opinion, so I am going to leave it as a MP.\nNow for the negatives.\nCONS:\n-Although I have some subjective issues with the UI, the UI isn't always the most responsive, and can be very, VERY -confusing.\n-The AI in this game is terrible. I was fighting this one shady guy, whom I will not spoil, and he all of a sudden just stopped dead, giving me a clear advantage to headshot him until I defeated him. And then when the ship is being boarded by some bad guys, I just had to go around a corner, and then shoot them. They wouldn't follow me, I just stood behind some bars and masscared them.\n-The ship you are on gets small when you are used to it. Atleast in System Shock 2 it was a hugemongolous ship with many features. It can get repetetive to wonder around it so much.\n-Dear lord can some of the objectives be confusing.\n-Short\n-The ending. ♥♥♥♥ the ending.\n-Admittedly, I got this on a free weekend, but I really cannot see myself paying money for this game. Especially with it's sequel (hopefully) coming out.\n-I get it  you wan't to be pacifist, but where did that say you could only have TWO combat sections?\n\nTo be truthful, I really like this game's story and atmosphere, and I think its an underrated title. But I can't give it a strong one, seeing as how the sequel (Who's trailer can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWTWJYXZvq8&index=2&list=PLAu3Msds_3yYijp70y6YVy_RyhDTQKsCW&ab_channel=InterdimensionalGamesInc ) is going to eventually come out, and then leave this game in the dust, with what seems to be more advanced gameplay and being on an actual mission. Plus it's being developed on UDK 4, as opposed to Source.\nBut if it's free, or on sale for cheap, get this game.","January 16","true","3.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The mechanics have an old skool feel to them, the graphics are a bit underwhelming and navigating the space is, and remains, something of a frustration throughout. I'm fairly sure this is a deliberate choice on the part of the developers. You can basically forget all of that because what drives this game is story and character. It's kind of like bits and pieces of your favorite sci-fi shows and games pulled together into a coherent whole. The fact you're in the middle of it all as it plays out, whether you like it or not, is just a bonus. You can of course play it any way you like, but you're almost certain to get involved at some point.\n\nOne of the smartest things about the game is it's played out in a single environment - a plane you happen to be stuck on. The fact this doesn't get stale at any point gives you some idea how much thought has gone into it. The constant crew banter and the pace of events certainly doesn't hurt either. Overall it's a good few hours of breakneck storytelling and decision making and the claims of replayability are certainly true. My first playthrough was 5 hours odd and I still don't know what the hell was going on...","January 16","true","6.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Infact, it's actually really good.\nAlthough, one thing that undertale takes advantage to in this game, is that it has a satisfying ending, that is actually an ending, if you do it right, and multiple nonsatisfying/terrifying endings if you don't. This game, it all leads up to one confusing sequel bait, "To be continued". It even says so itself. I'm not joking. At the very least the new game they're making (Of which's kickstarter will be avaliable on the 18th) looks pretty interesting.\nBut let's put it all in a list:\nPROS:\n+Good story. It confused me at the start, but kept me interested and immersed until the end.\n+Very interesting and realistic characters and reactions.\n+"Say nothing". It's about time that a game with dialogue, I am now able to say absolutely nothing when I have absolutely nothing to say. Or when there's nothing that I want to say.\n+ In all honesty, I think that the combat is fairly nice. Nothing special, just, nice. I had alot of fun in the VR tutorials.\n+The ship is laid out like a bloody ship.\n+The voice acting is top notch from the characters I've heard.\n+ Chess pieces. I like chess pieces.\n+ Your armor looks cool.\n+ It's, VERY immersive. Seriously.\n+Choices.\nAlright, you can probably tell that I'm running out of things to say, but that doesn't mean it's a bad game. I'm just running out of things to say. Most of these pros outweigh the mixed points and cons.\nMIXED POINTS\n*Admittedly, I think the dialogue is kinda limited. You use the first four function keys, function 4 always being "say nothing". It's not nearly as bad as it was in Fallout 4, but it's still kind of limited. However, for the most part, I don't see there needing any more dialogue options, so yeah.\n*Also, the dialogue system can be quite clunky for some, as there is the fear of pressing the wrong button, not knowing if you pressed the wrong button, and actually pressing the wrong button, and if you are using a controller, I don't know how you would be able to press anything. But I haven't tried it with a controller. So I'm not sure.\n*The graphics, are, well, I don't have that good of a machine, so I can't really complain about it too much, but they aren't the greatest in the world. But in my eyes, unless they are eyesoaringly ugly, I don't think graphics matter all that much.\n*Oh. I thought this was going to be in space.\n*The UI is pretty wierd. I'm one who despises Cyan, and despises it's use in Science fiction games, and despises hologram UI, but that's an opinion, so I am going to leave it as a MP.\nNow for the negatives.\nCONS:\n-Although I have some subjective issues with the UI, the UI isn't always the most responsive, and can be very, VERY -confusing.\n-The AI in this game is terrible. I was fighting this one shady guy, whom I will not spoil, and he all of a sudden just stopped dead, giving me a clear advantage to headshot him until I defeated him. And then when the ship is being boarded by some bad guys, I just had to go around a corner, and then shoot them. They wouldn't follow me, I just stood behind some bars and masscared them.\n-The ship you are on gets small when you are used to it. Atleast in System Shock 2 it was a hugemongolous ship with many features. It can get repetetive to wonder around it so much.\n-Dear lord can some of the objectives be confusing.\n-Short\n-The ending. ♥♥♥♥ the ending.\n-Admittedly, I got this on a free weekend, but I really cannot see myself paying money for this game. Especially with it's sequel (hopefully) coming out.\n-I get it  you wan't to be pacifist, but where did that say you could only have TWO combat sections?\n\nTo be truthful, I really like this game's story and atmosphere, and I think its an underrated title. But I can't give it a strong one, seeing as how the sequel (Who's trailer can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWTWJYXZvq8&index=2&list=PLAu3Msds_3yYijp70y6YVy_RyhDTQKsCW&ab_channel=InterdimensionalGamesInc ) is going to eventually come out, and then leave this game in the dust, with what seems to be more advanced gameplay and being on an actual mission. Plus it's being developed on UDK 4, as opposed to Source.\nBut if it's free, or on sale for cheap, get this game.","January 16","true","3.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerimadaikon/recommended/264240/","nerimadaikon","Blernka","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerimadaikon/","449 products in account","After hearing about this game being free for a weekend I decided what could be the harm in trying it out. Man have I been missing out. I have just recently finished my first playthrough and am itching for more. I can't wait for the kickstarter to finish and the boys that develope this game can continue their work on the Consortium trilogy.\n\nLet's go through some pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n-A very rich lore base that will keep anyone who is interested in world building very busy\n-The game's setup is fairly unique in it's presentation\n-The conversations are engaging and figuring out the big mystery has made me want to keep playing this game over and over.\n-The characters all feel fairly unique with their own designs and voices as well as personalities. It is interesting to see who is more eager to turn on someone than help figure out the mystery.\n-Speaking of mysteries, boy howdy is there alot of mystery in this game. Multiple times I found myself saying woah out loud.\n-The writing for the game is very solid and kept me well engaged through my first playthrough. I didn't even leave my seat before I finished it and I am eager to start my next playthrough.\n-Apparently there is the intention to import saves to the next "episode" of the game when it comes out so I feel that that is going to be incentive for many to get the perfect playthrough.\n\nCons:\n-Even though I don't really have a problem with it I know many others will and that's the fact that the graphics are a bit wonky. The style seems a bit cartoonish in appearence but there is also multiple times where the characters would have weird shadows on their faces or certain textures in the environment would just be a bit off.\n-The game really just drops you in with no brakes, so to some that can be a turn off.\n-At times I felt lost because I wasn't aware of a certain event that happened off screen in the lore of the game, making me go back to the intel databank to read on past or occuring events. To some that is a turn-off.\n-The gunplay is pretty basic so don't go into it expecting the next Call of Duty game. I'd say it's more akin to Deus Ex than anything.\n-Sometimes I couldn't really figure out where I needed to go or what I needed to do to finish a mission. Eventually I figured out there was a map at the center of the ship that tells you where everything was so that helped out a bit.\n-Relatively short but since I got the game for free there is no complaining from me.\n\nAll in all I definately think that if you are a fan of a great mystery and some stellar world building than this game is for you. This game was a game I didn't know I wanted and now I keep coming back for more. Do yourself a favor if your into game genres like sci-fi, mystery, and CYOA (Choose your own adventure).\n\nIf you do decide to play this game please go in blind like I did. It is best to figure things out on your own and to just enjoy the adventure!\n\nNote: The cons I listed are not explicitly how I feel about the game but are things that people looking to play should be made aware of.\n","January 16","true","6.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

You are actually accessing this reality from our own via iDGi's proprietary technology- a satellite link across multiple realities. ( This is an excellent plot device for explaining the "gaming-ness" of your visuals, they claim not to have perfected the technology yet). As a result, none of your colleagues know that you are controlling Six, and in order to not arouse suspicion you must play along, learning the story-and your past- as you go.\n\nTo further complicate matters, shortly after your arrival a murder is committed, and with the suspect sealed on board, time is running out for you to find them before things get worse. Much worse.\n\nWhere this game succeeds is in creating an incredible sense of place. The environment, the crew, the world building- all of it combines to make a believable future- if somewhat overwhelming. Keeping apace of all the new information can get a little much at times, although there are extra materials available outside of the game to give you a little more grounding.\n\nHands down the best thing about this game is the voice acting. One or two dodgy accents aside, the pace, delivery and impact of the cast is outstanding- you really do start to feel the personalites shine through. Add to that a conversation system that is timed, and you have to think carefully and quickly about what you say- making enemies on board probably isn't wise...\n\nCombat- of which there is little- is not particularly satisfying, and mercifully avoidable. Despite being FPS, it just doesn't seem to have the kick you'd expect it to. However, this is a minor gripe, as the game really should be played more in the style of a police procedural, finding clues, teasing information from crewmates and suspects, and choosing whether you can trust someone enough to reveal your existence- without dropping Six in trouble.\n\nThe game does finish on a high note, albeit a cliffhanger- this is the first in a trilogy, with the second due to hit Kickstarter this year.\n\nIt's a bit of an oddity, Consortium, but when it gets it right it's worth the price. Most reviews were for a release that had quite a few bugs, but the support from the developers since has rendered the game stable and enjoyable.","January 13","true","13.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Graphics and sound are good enough, controls play well enough. If I had to compare it to games I've played, it's a little like a mini Mass Effect with no aliens/exploration, more choices but worse combat? Conversations/actions affect your relationships with characters (via a point system) which may influence the options you have in the story (which branches out well enough).\n\nProbably the best point of this game is the world/lore. It has very extensive lore in the form of ingame articles, out-of-game documents and files, and a website. However, the rest of the story hasn't really been explored because you have to wait for future games to see more (their next game is going through Kickstarter). I think you will be able to carry over your save to the next game so relationships and decisions may hopefully play some part in the next game.\n\nThe way I played the game I spent much more time in dialogue than combat (but I don't think there were too many opportunities for combat besides the V.T. simulation). For combat, you have an inventory system with equipment slots and a small variety of weapons to use. You can choose between lethal and non-lethal, though non-lethal is less effective. I think it's a shame you don't get to really play around with it outside of the V.T. sim but the story plays out as the story plays out and combat is limited in this episode.\n\nI think Consortium is a very nice opening chapter/episode to a world that has more going on than what has been presented. If you want to run and gun and skip all the text then there are better games for that. If you're looking for a Sci-Fi world you can immerse yourself in and enjoy reading optional text to flesh out the world (more text than Skyrim/Dark Souls) this may be what you're looking for.","January 16","true","13.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

A murder mystery that none of the NPCs seem to be concerned about, has no clues, and ends without anyone being even wrongly accused.

CONSORTIUM is one of those games. You're plunged into a world you don't understand, hearing terms you don't recognise, encountering a ranking structure that is unfamiliar. You get the greatest feeling you can get in a game: the need to explore and learn more about this fascinating universe.\n\nSuffice to say the opening is excellent at drawing you in and the music of Jeremy Soule is well utilised here.\n\nIt's a game about people and relationships. You will spend most of your time walking around the ship interacting with the crew, and every member of that crew has their own voice, personality, relationships with other crew members. Everyone feels like a real person, there's no lazy stereotypes here, no accented characters firing off lines about "in my homeland" or anything like that. They're just people.\n\nThe dialogue system helps with this feeling of a living vessel. Conversations don't pause the game or take control away from you. You can walk away, they can walk away, people can interrupt, other conversations carry on around you, they keep working on whatever task it was they were doing. Rather than taking you out of the game, conversations draw you deeper into it. And, hallelujah, keyboard shortcuts for dialogue options!\n\nThis game is part one of three with a larger meta arc straddling the series, but this game features a central mystery around a traitor aboard the ship. And this is my favourite bit: whether you discover who that traitor is is entirely up to you; you can end this episode not knowing. And it's not easy, you will most likely fail. How awesome is that?\n\nIt's reasonably short with about five hours of gameplay (though there's tens of hours of material in the console if you want to read it all), but it replays well. You're going to miss events, things play out differently depending on your choices, conversations might not happen, characters might not appear. I think you could easily get three playthroughs out of this without feeling bored. While I wouldn't recommend browsing the achievements before playing this game, they give you a good idea of the number of different things that can happen and how many of them you've missed.\n\nThe game isn't without weaknesses and there are a few biggies:\n\n1. Combat isn't great, primarily because the entire episode takes place on the ship and the ship makes for a really poor combat environment. There's not really any cover to work with or great ways to maneuver, you will generally just hold down the trigger or find ways to cheese the AI for the tough bits. It is supposedly possible to make it through the game without firing a shot though. I've almost done it.\n\n2. The inventory doesn't feel like it has a reason for being and is incredibly clumsy. It has that Mass Effect vibe of existing because people expect to see it.\n\n3. The game just sort of ends without any feeling of closure. Sure, it's part one of three, but games like Mass Effect and The Walking Dead have shown how you can be part of a larger arc while still managing closure at the end of your game.\n\n4. I have concerns with the meta element of "you are playing a game" which is being worked into the story. It works in dialogues in a jokey "are you mad?" kind of way, but it seems to be becoming a larger part of the plot in a way I'm not that keen on.\n\nAll-in-all though I'd recommend it. It feels new and exciting, and setting the whole game in one location works really well.","January 21, 2014","true","20.6"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

If you don't mind having to deal with graphics that aren't as high end as many other games, and you enjoy games rich with story lines and converstation options then I suggest this game.

And you could interact with the crew and witness the drama directly and not through audio logs after the fact? I did, and CONSORTIUM plays a lot like what I imagined it to be.\n\nBeginning of this game was some of the most exciting stuff I've played in a long time. You're on a military vessel in a middle of a crisis, helping the ship's survival, building relationships with crew members, trying to outsmart your foes, on the outside and on the inside. The writing and voice acting is good, the conversations are sharp and the game is very good at acknowledging what you do and shifting the events accordingly.\n\nBut the murder mystery at the core of this episode proved to be a tough nut to crack. I'm currently beginning my third playthrough (the second one was interrupted by a progress-stopping bug) and I'm still no closer to discovering the real villain. At this point I'm not sure if I must calculate it logically by using what I know, catch the evildoes in the act somewhere or just grill some witness until they reveal something. Making logical conclusions seems unreliable when the world is so full of ~sci-fi magic~ that the rules change all the time.\n"We can telepathically see and hear all through your eyes!"\n"But no, there's been a hack, and now no-one can see you!"\n"No, wait, I did a counter-hack and I still totally can!"\n(And I bet Sherlock Holmes never had to deal with bs teleportation before.)\n\nSo I'll keep trying until I stumble on a solution. At this point I've done some save reloading and checked the ways the plot forces some events on you no matter what you do. The more freedom a game promises you, the more invested you become in your choices, the more jarring it gets when you finally hit the bars of the cage, the limitations that the videogame has to impose on you. In the same vein as Aplha Protocol and The Walking Dead became disappointing when you realized how little you could actually change, this game promises you so much more, and it's inevitably a bummer when you cannot always do what you believe you should be doing in a given situation. But it's still a big step in a very exciting direction, and I'm eagerly waiting to see where Part 2 will take us.\n\nNow the words of warning.\nThe game looks an controls like crap. There's no getting around it. Moving around the plane is a chore. You get stuck on ladders, you can pass through closed doors (and sometimes open doors become impassable), lights go out in different sections seemigly at random (why can't a super soldier pick up a flashlight?) You can never reliably interact with anything - only a certain part of any object is clickable, but a similar object can be non-clickable at all, leading to constant pixel hunts. The same goes for people: half of the time you cannot even click on them, which makes them just part of the scenery.\nAnd don't even get me started on combat. I had to go with the non-lethal route during a fight with a certain person, because the rifle that was in my hands refused to acknowledge I had bullets, both in my pockets and in my inventory! And I had no way to test it beforehand, because combat mode was locked until the scoundrel was all up in my grill.\n\nMultiple replays are mandatory to see all that the game has to offer, and this makes you feel almost like the character from Source Code, who is aware of the fact that he relives the same sequence over and over. What's wonderful is that your dialog choices support this mode of behaviour. Too bad you have to sit through several long unskippable holochat conversations throughout the game that get pretty old once you've sat through them once. One excruciatingly long, detailed briefing explains to you a mission THAT WILL NOT BE HAPPENING IN THIS GAME. On the next playthrough you might as well start the sequence and then go drink some tea.\n\nBut is it still worth it? Absolutely!\nDon't try it if you are easily annoyed by lack of polish and poor production values. Consortium has been made on a shoestring budget by a small team who were too excited to explore new ways a game can interact with the player, and they're not asking too much for their work. It's an interesting experiment that has potential to lead to better things in the future. If you ever found yourself enjoying E.Y.E., Pathologic or Deadly Premonition, you are the kind of person who can appreciate it when a game offers you something new, even if playing it requires an open mind and a bunch of patience.","June 9, 2014","true","18.1"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Keramane/recommended/264240/","Keramane","Keramane","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Keramane/","282 products in account","Pros\n- Complex, well-developed characters.  Voice acting and scripting is done very well and they all feel to be believable people with individual goals, desires and motivations.\n- Simple, intuitive controls.  It uses the WSAD movement with hotbar standard, but I like that the inventory screen doesn't stop time so much as vastly slow it down.  It's far more believable than Skyrim's stop-time-sort-through-inventory-resume-with-opponent-naked while still getting the job done.  It also forces you to make quick decisions while in combat while still acknowledging that you're a human being who might take some time to think.\n- Incredibly deep backstory and history.  While not everyone will be interested to read into the pages and pages of historical documents, I found them to be great reads that really helped define the world and paint a vivid universe in which to live, breathe and play in.\n- Notable attitude and path adjustment.  Unlike Mass Effect (which I did still enjoy quite alot) it's not good/evil/neutral in black and white.  Killing vs Incapacitating does much of the morality course adjustment, but social encounters between characters also play heavily into affect.  There are more branches than the three standards, or at the very least, it appears to be as such.\n- Simple, intuitive ship design.  It's a little confusing at first but once you figure it out, you can get anywhere and everywhere quite quickly.  Also, it all makes plausible, practical sense; something of a rarity in game design.  There's no wasted space, no unexplained areas that defy the overal structural design.\n- Fantastic atmosphere.  The music, the occasional static surge in the linkup, the turbulence that the plane suffers, it all makes the experience far more believable.  When you hit a pocket of turbulance, the plane shakes and people react to it.  When you get signal interrupts, your view goes staticy and people sound as if underwater.\n- Clever balance of inventory to sustainability.  Your energy bar is used to heal yourself and repair your armor, but it also serves as a 'carry weight' limit to your inventory.  You can only store so much in your PCU before you run out of energy buffer; energy that could be used to heal you and fix you up.  Energy is relatively easy to get but healing is expensive, so it makes for a unique mmicro-meta.\n\nCons\n- Very short.  While doing every possible path can really make the gameplay quite long, if you take a direct course the game finishes very quickly.\n- Graphically average.  You won't see this thing rivalling Crysis or getting any visual awards.  The colours are very primal, really makes me think of classic Star Trek with the polar blues and whites and reds.  It gets the job done, and I mean no offense to the graphics team, however it is 'average' by big name standards.\n- Minimal combat.  Personally, I love the amount of conversation and depths in the game, but I would have liked to see a bit more action.  I expect far more of it in the second game, considering the ending of this one.\n\nNeutral/Grey Areas\n- Bugs.  They exist.  This is a temporary Con, but one that should be mentioned all the same.  However, it is a mild one as the support staff seem quite responsive.\n- Graphical hiccups.  There are shadows cast by crew heads that don't react well to the texture meshes or the general line of the neck.  I'm not an artist, I'm not sure what the issue is.  Still, it's rather distracting.  Technically a con but super super minor.\n\nOpinion\nThe game was worth the money spent.  It was a wonderful delve into a rich universe where I sincerely felt that my actions would cause a multitude of paths to open up for future content.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Keramane/recommended/264240/","Keramane","Keramane","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Keramane/","282 products in account","Pros\n- Complex, well-developed characters.  Voice acting and scripting is done very well and they all feel to be believable people with individual goals, desires and motivations.\n- Simple, intuitive controls.  It uses the WSAD movement with hotbar standard, but I like that the inventory screen doesn't stop time so much as vastly slow it down.  It's far more believable than Skyrim's stop-time-sort-through-inventory-resume-with-opponent-naked while still getting the job done.  It also forces you to make quick decisions while in combat while still acknowledging that you're a human being who might take some time to think.\n- Incredibly deep backstory and history.  While not everyone will be interested to read into the pages and pages of historical documents, I found them to be great reads that really helped define the world and paint a vivid universe in which to live, breathe and play in.\n- Notable attitude and path adjustment.  Unlike Mass Effect (which I did still enjoy quite alot) it's not good/evil/neutral in black and white.  Killing vs Incapacitating does much of the morality course adjustment, but social encounters between characters also play heavily into affect.  There are more branches than the three standards, or at the very least, it appears to be as such.\n- Simple, intuitive ship design.  It's a little confusing at first but once you figure it out, you can get anywhere and everywhere quite quickly.  Also, it all makes plausible, practical sense; something of a rarity in game design.  There's no wasted space, no unexplained areas that defy the overal structural design.\n- Fantastic atmosphere.  The music, the occasional static surge in the linkup, the turbulence that the plane suffers, it all makes the experience far more believable.  When you hit a pocket of turbulance, the plane shakes and people react to it.  When you get signal interrupts, your view goes staticy and people sound as if underwater.\n- Clever balance of inventory to sustainability.  Your energy bar is used to heal yourself and repair your armor, but it also serves as a 'carry weight' limit to your inventory.  You can only store so much in your PCU before you run out of energy buffer; energy that could be used to heal you and fix you up.  Energy is relatively easy to get but healing is expensive, so it makes for a unique mmicro-meta.\n\nCons\n- Very short.  While doing every possible path can really make the gameplay quite long, if you take a direct course the game finishes very quickly.\n- Graphically average.  You won't see this thing rivalling Crysis or getting any visual awards.  The colours are very primal, really makes me think of classic Star Trek with the polar blues and whites and reds.  It gets the job done, and I mean no offense to the graphics team, however it is 'average' by big name standards.\n- Minimal combat.  Personally, I love the amount of conversation and depths in the game, but I would have liked to see a bit more action.  I expect far more of it in the second game, considering the ending of this one.\n\nNeutral/Grey Areas\n- Bugs.  They exist.  This is a temporary Con, but one that should be mentioned all the same.  However, it is a mild one as the support staff seem quite responsive.\n- Graphical hiccups.  There are shadows cast by crew heads that don't react well to the texture meshes or the general line of the neck.  I'm not an artist, I'm not sure what the issue is.  Still, it's rather distracting.  Technically a con but super super minor.\n\nOpinion\nThe game was worth the money spent.  It was a wonderful delve into a rich universe where I sincerely felt that my actions would cause a multitude of paths to open up for future content.  How well that translates into the second game will be a strong determining factor in this one's final value, but I feel it was worth my time and expense.\n\nTL;DR - Get it if you like story over action.  If you want a many-levelled shooter, not the game you want.\n\nPersonal Rating = 7.4/10\nThough I will site a slight bias as the game seems a bit more polarized to my preferences.","January 9, 2014","true","7.8"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

And when you do so, you find yourself in control of the body of someone known only to you as "Bishop Six", aboard what equates to being a space-worthy 747 (not sure if it ever actually goes into space in-game though - I haven't completed the game as of this review), shortly before it runs into some snags during a fairly routine flight.\n\nAs for the Alpha Protocol comparison, some might consider it to be more akin to Mass Effect, although from my small experience with this game, it seems more similar to AP, as it appears to be much more focused on the dialogue/relationship side of things, than what ME is. (Since let's face it, nothing wrong with ME but a lot of it WAS just basically picking out of being either a good guy/bad guy stereotype, compared to AP's more intricate system) So in other words, although there's pictures of firefights on the store page, there does seem to always - again, at least where I'm up to - be a way around it, if you wish to play the tactful negotiator or wily deceiver.\n\nIn summary, this appears to be a game that offers you many playstyle choices and high replay-ability, so I definitely recommend it to anyone who has played games similar to Alpha Protocol, Mass Effect, or other RPGs featuring an emphasis on dialogue and building/breaking relationships.

As far as the game itself It is a little confusing at first but after a few playthroughs and after understanding it, it is very interesting what you find out about the game and how many options there are to wind up getting from your choices. HOWEVER the one downfall about this game that is a huuugeeeee pet peve of mine is how short it is after waiting so long for it to be fixed to playablity. I was so excited, played it and then before I knew it, I beat it... It doesn't take that long to get through this game and if your not one for re-playability then this game is definitly not for you because it is a very short game. The only thing that can make you play this game over and over again is the desire or interest in seeing what other and how many other different outcomes you can get/ wind up with. However if that is not your style in a game then look elsewhere because this game will definitly not be for you. You will play through it extremely quickly and then after beating it, you will think that you've just wasted the worst $20 of your life and think the game is a rip off. However if re-playability in games is your style and seeing what different things you can wind up happening story wise then you'll be playing this game for hours. Following the achievements this game has helps in getting the different story outcomes and each one is unique in its own way.","January 22, 2014","true","18.4"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","1"

I bought this game on sale, and I can safely say it was my flavor of the week! I haven't played an RPG with so much emphasis on decision making as this in a very long time, if ever. There are a couple times where I felt the game lacked interactivity with the environment, like not being able to pick up things that you would think should be picked up (books, trinkets etc.) but by no means is this a deal breaker.\n\nThe story is facinating. I was immediately drawn into this scifi universe because it feels very alive. The weakest point of this game would probably have to be the gunplay. It's cool, it's fast, but it feels very unrefined. There were times where I was just standing in one spot holding down the fire button because the enemies spawned in the same location. Again, not a deal breaker, but you probably shouldn't expect a gunfight-stravaganza of a game.\n\nOverall, it was fun! Get it if you have the means and you love RPGs!\n\nHigh five to the maker of the game.","May 7, 2014","true","4.3"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Its a good mix of a developing narrative which creates as many questions as it answers, along with reasonable inventory and combat mechanics that can be quite challenging when tested. Its quite short, though there are promised future installments, but it definitely pulled me in (I finished it in two sessions and can't imagine playing it in any smaller chunks).\nI'd highly recommend it despite PC Gamer's criticism of the graphics; they are what they are, to be honest.","May 16, 2014","true","7.6"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bloodywolf/recommended/264240/","Bloodywolf","Wolvenheart","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bloodywolf/","339 products in account","Before we begin let's get this straight: This is a game very heavy on story and interaction with NPC's. If you're the kind of person whom likes to skip as much dialog as possible and just want to spend hours shooting things up, this game is not for you.\n\nAlso, AT THE TIME OF WRITING, there were bugs in the game that made you save often should something go wrong. However, the devs pretty much responded to them instantly and I'm quite confident this game will be fixed by the end of January 2014. (Remember this is a small Indie team game with limited testing resources pre launch.) If you're worried, check the forums. (Try to avoid spoilers however, since finding out everything for yourself is 90% of the fun in your first playthrough.)\n\nThat said:\nThis is one of the most refreshing games I've played in a while when it comes to an ACTUAL First Person Role Playing Game. You have the basic, an inventory system, your quickbars and as the items you require get stronger, so do you. But feature is used in probably only 10% of the actual game, and even that can be skipped if you play it like a smooth criminal and talk your way out of things. (Remember this is the first episode, the next 2 might contain a lot more combat)\n\nBut the real juicy part is the dialog system. As you make your way though the game, you gain and lose status with people. if it gets bad, you have less options, if it gets high, you'll have an easier time interacting with them. The problem? Certain actions boosts one, but lowers the other one. So be careful what you say.\n\nThere is no hand holding in this game, do you make the wrong choice, you'll have to live with it (unless you reload a past save, you cheeky basterd). Conversation is fuild, engaging and unless you do a blanc carbon copy of your last playthrough, not one playthrough is the same. You'll have to actually think, consider or ignore facts, make split descisions, explore and live with the consequences if things pan out badly.\n\nThe conversation system gives you a pretty diverse amount of conversation directions, and there are events that happen that can change the course of the game if you react badly. A crewmate could be injured, and you have about a second or 2 to heal them, you don't get prompted for this, you don't get warned this might happen, but it will impact your story on a decent scale. Especially if you consider your story will continue in the next episodes.\n\nThe lore behind the game is pretty vast. And there is a reason why the description talks about satalites and such, and the game will remind you of it through hints and events now and then.\n\nIs it worth the price? Remember this is an indie game, and all money they earn will be funded mostly towards the next episodes. But then again, it really depends your tastes. For me, I had a lot of fun with it, and with multiple playthoughs, the game will last you quite a while. However, it might be a decent sum if you're not sure if it is the game for you.\n\nThe Graphics are a little outdated, but their cartoonish look, combined with a calming enviroment, make it easy on the eyes and you won't even care after 10 minutes. It has a Star Wars the clone wars cartoon series vibe going on in the looks department (Jar Jar free).","January 18, 2014","true","5.4"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

It won't last you more than 5 hours.\n\nLook forward to the second installment hoping that the game will be longer and finished when released.","February 2, 2014","true","11.4"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Let me tell you, I've never played anything like this before. The endless possibilities of outcomes to every situation is something I've never seen in a game before. The universe they have created it so convincing due to really good voice acting and background lore. The best thing about this game is the engaging and hillarious -even surprisingly- story.\n\nSure, there are one or two bugs in this game, but noting gamebreaking at all. The team consist of only six people, give them a breake :) I suspect some of the negative reviews are a consequence of the developers releasing the game before it was polished, but now they have worked so hard to fix all reported problems; and the result is the master edition, which is totally playable.\nSure, the story as of today takes 5 hours, but they will be releasing more of the story later.

The combat is secondary and pretty old school, but the dialog parts are very good. The game itself is not huge, but the story is interesting and has allot of lore to it.\n\nWhile the game is short, the whole point of the game is to play it a few times to actually figure out what is going on. Well, at least figure out whats going on in this episode of the game...\nThe first play through is like playing a mix between Sherlock Holmes vs Jack the Ripper, Star Trek and Dues Ex.\n\nIf you are looking for something that is not like most other games you could give this a try.\nThe Master Edition v1.2 was stable for me and I had no issues playing through the game. (Win 8.1) Cost wise I think the game is worth around 15 EUR. So waiting for a sale might be the thing to do. That said, if the price is around that for the next episode I might just get it.\n\nA few minor tips when playing [No spoilers]:\n*While Primary seems important. The meat of the game are the secondaries so do not make yourself feel rushed by the Captain when she gives you primary stuff to do. Basically the primary is more about "continuing" the plot rather than resolving. So enjoy the game and, mostly, do what you think is most important rather than what other people say.\n* The inventory is based on you having energy OR inventory items. So you have to balance the two. Thats why you some times cant pick stuff up. However you can vent energy whenever you want and regain new from terminals all over the plane.\nSuit slots do not take up space though. So put the weapons you use in the dual mini slots above and under the backpack.\n* I recommend getting to grips with the controls, totally, when you are in the VR section at the start so you are not caught off guard later.\n\nOh yeah and... wise people are cautious about trust. :P","May 5, 2014","true","10.3"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

While nothing special to look at, the game has a unique visual style (though graphics aren't really my thing, I would say the game 'looks' functional but unfinished - it needs textures).\n\nUniqueness is really the quality that carries this game. If you fancy trying something very different, give it a try.\n\nThe game manages to blend the rich and involving atmosphere of, say, Deus Ex (right down to detailed news feeds and history, excerpts from books) with an original, self contained setting like Portal did (as in, a setting that is already there whether or not you have 'revealed' it through gameplay). The Stanley Parable was billed as a game about choices, if you prefer not to spend your time making banal choices, this might be preferable. Everything in the game guides the player back into its setting, which is something I find very refreshing these days. The plot itself is seamless and although the choices are obvious, the possibilities are not...\n\nHowever. It is well that the game relies on its atmosphere, mystery and dialogue - these form the meat of the game, with combat being a rushed and simplistic affair that fortunately only arrives in short doses.\n\nI must also gripe about the length. Though the game has great replayability, if I had any idea quite how short it is, I would never have paid £8 for it in the Steam Sales...as it stands the regular price before that was nearer to £15 and that is simply asking too much for a game that took me about two hours to play through. Replayability or not, I was hoping to be told a story and all I got was the first chapter of one.\n\nWhich is annoying, since the games credits sequence is basically an advertisement for a second game. I can't help but feel Consortium was a missed opportunity, as I actually feel a little bit conned by the length and this will certainly colour my decision to buy the next installment - that said, I was *very* gripped by the plot.\n\nI think people should experience Consortium, but I couldn't honestly recommend paying the current rates for it. It felt, to be honest, like buying a demo.","June 30, 2014","true","4.4"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

It is very short but has a high replay value. It's a bit of a mix of Sci-Fi RPG à la Deus Ex and Mystery Crime Adventure. Therefore, your (dialogue) choices matter and there are many of them. This allows you to replay the game several times and see many different outcomes.\n\nThe setup is that in the game, you are playing an Augmented Reality game in which you take control of a real person in a parallel Earth universe in the year 2042 (iirc). You take control of this person, who is a "Bishop" on a (military?) aircraft, where the ranks are named after chess figures (Pawns, Rook, Knights, Bishop etc.). While you are controlling him, you do not know his name, his past, his background, nothing... which results in interesting dialogues where you try to converse with people who know more about you than you do.\n\nAll of the game plays on this aircraft. You need to know that they have planned this game as a trilogy and this is the introduction. It took me around 4 hours to play through and the ending is a real cliffhanger. Howevery, the second game, called Consortium: The Tower Prophecy, will be out soon and you are able to take your save game (= all your decisions) with you into the new game. (like in Mass Effect)\n\nThe graphics are a bit dated (the new game will be on UE4 and the trailers suggest that it looks way better than this one) but that did not lessen my enjoyment of this game. It was full of surprises, there was a lot of background info to find out (and to read, yes, read! If you don't like reading in videogames, this is maybe not ideal for you... the dialogues are voiced), the story was incredibly well written, the choices really mattered (and I'm very anxious to find out what their influence will be in the future Consortium games) and it motivated me enough to play through in one swift session - which is rare nowadays for me.\n\nWhile I really enjoyed Consortium, it may be off-putting to people who expect an action FPS (there aren't many shooting sequences and they are very short, it's more an adventure than a FPS), who do not like to "play detective" and find out what's going on on their own or to people who expect a huge skilltree and character modifications (there are none, except the items you equip). Consortium is an adventure game first and foremost, with RPG-elements in it.\n\nIf you like adventures, mysteries, solving crimes, exploring every crook and nanny, meaningful dialogue choices and a futuristic setting, this game is for you and I recommend it highly. I'm already looking forward to the next episode of this intruiging story.","August 23, 2015","true","4.3"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

There are few cons though one is it's length i heard it's short but i did not think it would be this short. This game is meant to be played as a trilogy with your save file transferd but it's actually hard to get immersed in the story with this length good rpgs as you know take many hours to develop a connection with your charcter and other charcters. proberly the worst con is a desing decsion when your low in health or have brain damage in battle the game fades out like when you watch white noise on a tv it gets unplayble it's a mass effect special effect i think in new installments it could be done more suttle. There are a few issues with background sound sometimes being louder than the voice acting and with problems with closed captioning.

The concept of the game is very good, and the interior of the  aircraft you're on seems well designed if not a little TARDIS like, the colours of the interior though are drab and rather monochrome, a little more attention in this department would have improve the surroundings. Little bits of random turbulence and interference in the game adds to the feeling of realisim.\n\nThe game plays out a lot like a film, but you also get a feeling your not completely in control. Your actions are via dialogue with the AI characters and though you do have choices you don't really feel as if these choices will have much effect and are mostly a choice between your character looking dumb or acting like you know whats happening (when you've not got a clue). At another point I was told to surrender and holster my gun by pressing H key, I did but the AI still told me I'd regret not doing as I was told and a shoot out happening anyway.\n\nThe general path of the story is good but some of the actions that occur don't feel very realistic (like simply requesting a priate lets your aircraft pass and all will be forgotten). There are other little things and snap you from being drawn in, the character eyes sometimes turn too far and show all white as well and limbs clipping objects (like gestures from arms slicing through chair arms).\n\nIf there was a scale of how much potiental the devs have got with this concept it'll be 11 out of 10 but you get the feeling playing the it just missed the mark. I desperately wanted this game to draw me and at times it did but those little oddities just broke my from the depth of the game and I was just playing an adventure game again. I get the feeling I'm missing lore in the game that would improve my involvemtn but get the feeling that I'd have to invest a whole lot of time reading computer enteries to get to this level and I'd rather be playing than reading to be honest.

With elements of Mass Effect, Assassin's Creed, and Deus Ex thrown in to a weird-filtered, post-state one world government blender and given a good whirl, it is certainly a beast of its own. Combat is fun if a mite simple, but thats not where the depth of this experience is. This is a game that respects your free will. Make the choice to kill, to spare, to enrage, to befriend, to say nothing at all. Everything is valid and have consequences that make sense. Characters are likable or believable. Backstory is provided in veritable heaps if you care to read it. This is a game for someone who wants to digest a world, not someone who wants to shoot a whole bunch of people. I imagine you could speed through this game in a quarter of the time it would take you if you took your time reading files and talking to the crew. If you want an action game I suggest you go elsewhere, but if you want a game that immerses you in it's story with good voice acting, extensive backstory, and player choice this may be right up your alley. Reccomended, and I look forward to future installments.\n\nNote: I am aware of the issues others have run into regarding game breaking bugs.

Last but not least: I have never, never, never reloaded any scene in any other game as often as this free fall here.\n\nSorry, this is not playing, this is gametesting and paying for it :(\n\nBetter Luck next time!","January 10, 2014","false","6.4"," 4 of 12 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","4","12","0","0"

It's also a murder mystery, a sci fi adventure and more. The choices you make make some difference to the story, but not a whole lot. Still, the chioces you make, and the discussions you have will alter and affect the behaviour of those around you. THe graphics may be simplistic, but that's not why I bought it. The VR missions are tough, and also rather pointless in my opinion. I focused mainly on the story, and it developed gradually and effectively.\n\nHowever, I have to say it's also cliched and rather unimaginative. An ex-terrorists son taking hostages? Really? Couldn't have come with anything brighter than that? The final sequence, the JUMP, is really interesting, and apparently it will affect the way the sequel plays if there is a sequel and what happens to the Bishop 6 (the char you play).\n\nIt hits more than it misses, but it does miss sometimes very badly. For example characters just standing around doing nothing except tapping at an imaignary keyboard in the air. I guess air keyboard woud be the the term.\n\nI like the characters, I liked the story for the most part. What gets me is that at the end, is a real big shock. I won't tell you what it is, but it makes replayability redundant, and that makes me wonder why that is so when it's one its selling points.\n\nI'd give the game 7/10 or a B- or something. It's a solid game that deserves to be played at least once, I pray there is a sequel, but I also hope it's sensibly priced as this first chapter is way too expensive for a 6 hour game. I guess time is not how it shoudl be judged, but if you were paying 30 dollars for 6 hours, wouldn't you ofeel a tad ripped off even if the game was amazing?\n\nHopefully these short comings can be resolved in a sequel.\n\nOverall I really, truly enjoyed the game, and haven't played anything like it for a long time. A justified purchase, but perhaps at a lower price point","May 18, 2014","true","7.4"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Thomas-/recommended/264240/","Thomas-","Chargeback Thomas","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Thomas-/","748 products in account","The developers contacted me by email asking me to give this game a thumbs up, telling me it does not matter what I actually write about the game so long as I rate it positive. So here is my (negative) review.\n\nConsortium is a first person shooter/action/adventure game.\n\nThe game is all very fourth wall, where you yourself are transported into the game world via a satellite. You're a "Bishop" in the Consortium, aboard the ZENLIL ship, where everyone has ranks matching the game of chess.\n\nYour task is to stop rebellion forces attacking the ship and ensuring it safely reaches its destination. However things go south and you're tasked with trying to uncover which person on the ship is a traitor to your cause, using a speech system similar to most RPG games.\n\nThe game is incredibly short, at around 1-2, maybe 3 hours, with some minor replayability. The game ends abruptly, which left me incredibly disappointed. I was extremely excited for this game and even pre-ordered, but once the game ended I suddenly saw that it's episodic. This is something the developers never indicated which left a -very- sour taste in my mouth. I was incredibly let down which is why I cannot recommend this game. I'm sure the sequel will also be just as short with an ending just as abrupt.\n\nWait for the next two episodes to release, and pick all three up on a sale. Maybe Consortium as a whole will be good as all three games, but this sole entry is too short and lacks the depth for me to recommend a purchase.","January 15","false","6.6"," 55 of 118 people (47%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","47","55","118","14","4"

So many things just resist me ejoying it:\n\nA murder is committed and a book dropped that seems like evidence, but I can't interact with the book or the body.\nMany somewhat interesting dialog trees later I find myself trying to navigate through a chat with a madman and attempting somehow not to anger him. Failing to appease him (not sure what I said wrong) I end up having to fight his platoon of mercenaries to save the ship and its crew.\n\nI grab a rifle. head in, and am able to gun them all down pretty easily, but then everyone in the crew is very upset at all of the deaths (?!). I go back to a save (this is very well implemented ) and grab a non lethal weapon. Sure, okay ...\n\nAfter some trial and error I am able to stun and incapcaitate the first two waves of mercenaries without any killing, but the the third wave is randomly immune to my stun weapon (has shields) and guns me down. A couple times. And the stun grenades are for a rifle I didn't pick up (learned that in Steam forum threads). You can only carry one weapon. I guess having stunned 10 mercs I could take  rifle off of one of them and shoot their mates and boss dead...\n\nWhen I went to reload to try the conversation with the madman again, the the game crashed and steam is updating it now synching all of my failures to the clouds. I learned that the fight I kept losing is avoidable from the forums as well  ... it seems pretty bloody inevitable in my plays of the game.\n\nBrilliantly conceived, pretty well executed, but barely playable.","January 23, 2015","false","1.7"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/OrangeCaramello/recommended/264240/","OrangeCaramello","Doktor Whoville","http://steamcommunity.com/id/OrangeCaramello/","618 products in account","So I was pretty excited about this game, so much so, that it was my Birthday Gift to myself.  I read some reviews, watched some gameplay footage, watched a trailer, and it looked like a game that would be right up my alley.  Talked about it with a few friends, we all put the game on our wishlist, so it seemed like it was a game to buy, so I did.\n\nFirst thing I did, when I started the game, was I went to the options menu, turned the sound down, it said would you like to enable controller support, don't mind if I do, sadly only had two button presets to choose from, so I chose the one that I thought would be better for me.  I get in the game, the intro is confusing, it's very blurry, it's trying to simulate that you've had a bad hack, the upload isn't responding correctly, and it takes what feels a few minutes, of standing and doing nothing to get the game started.\n\nGame starts, short introduction with your security office, who directs you to med bay, which I spent the first 25 minutes of the game, exploring the ship to find med bay, and in the course of doing so, I would walk, with my controller, I could respond to conversations with the controller, but that's all I could do, I still needed the keyboard to interact with the environment, to tab open my inventory, and the mouse to look around, so then when you're doing all of that with the mouse and keyboard, why am I using the controller, so yeah, I stopped using the controller before I found med bay.\n\nSo in med bay had the option to just be like, I'm from the past hacked into a video game, and the character I'm talking too, calls me Neo, so was kind of a funny, yet cheesy reference, but this guy, he has no personality, is very monotoned, lacks emotion, so I'm hoping, that he's either the traitor, or an android, because either way, I want the opportunity to kill him, and I just met him.\n\nSo the game is suppose to be about choices, 4,000 lines of spoken dialogue, you're choices bear a reaction, no, not really, basically most of the time you have two choices, which are decent, one choice of why the hell would I ever say that, and the option to say nothing, and sometimes instead of 4 choices, you only have 3, with the option of saying nothing always being viable.  So yeah, you use the dialogue tree, and sometimes they acknowledge your input, and other times they disregard your input, as if what you said was frivolous.  It gives you the feeling like the option you picked wasn't the right choice, and next time pick the correct option Jackass.\n\nThe most amusing part of the game so far, was when we discover the dead body, and the female security officer attempts to get emotional, attempts being the keywords, when really, all she is, is mad at you, and of course when you pick the option of hey, calm down, he was just a redshirt, while it was amusing to say it, yeah, you just feel her scorn all the further, and of course when they start moving the dead body, and you tell them not to disturb the body, this needs to be investigated, once again, you're just dismissed, and we're going to move the body anyway.\n\nSo in revenge for being snuffed, about moving the dead body, I recycled the evidence intentionally.  They were like, why did you do that, and I was like because I felt like it, and then, oh well, no bother, whatever could be gathered was gathered when you recycled it, so it's all fine. :cfacepalm:\n\nThere was a moment, where I had to choose about whether to let a crew memeber live or die, and instinctively it was, I have to save him, which within two minutes, he started speaking again, and it was, why did I save this redshirt!?!?  One of the selling points of this game was that it had tremendous voice acting, man if you call cheesey over the top Aussie impersonating, and puffy british pouting, and some guy that sounds like an android, tremendous voice acting, I mean I game with several Austrailians, it would have been like Mick Dundee coming to the party all over again, and they don't want that.\n\nAlso, again, they are trying to make it evident, that you hacked in very shottiley, so the sound is sometimes static filled, the video becomes blurry, and you can fail to interact with several pieces of equipment at anytime, more annoying then going for immersion, in fact it breaks immersion, because it is so annoying.\n\nI talked to the crew, I don't feel emotionally invested in any of them, the one flirty chick is married, so where's the self destruct button on this ship, I'd like to blow it up myself.\n\nSo if you were thinking about buying this game, before a sale, during a sale, after a sale, do yourself a favor, and regardless of the price, just skip it.\n\nOther then that, the brief moments of cheesy humor is the only thing saving this game, so, 2/5 stars...","January 9, 2014","false","4.7"," 13 of 31 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","13","31","0","5"
