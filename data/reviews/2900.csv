BTW I hope you learned how to use sonar and stealth tactics for a submarine in high school otherwise its very touch and go for the first 5 hours.\n2: A hard sell for full price 20 dollars based off its a 1997 game best to find it on sale.\nFINAL\n\nI give this game a  7.0\n\nA great simulator , if you can take the time experiment and  read all the manuals and figuar out how a nuclear sub actually works you will find this game has a surprisingly high fun factor even for a 1997 game.\n","March 31, 2014","true","68.4"," 40 of 43 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","40","43","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/trar/recommended/2900/","trar","Hammurabi of Babylon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/trar/","318 products in account","A classic in the genre. The missions may be canned - with no random variation aside from random box patrols and units reacting to you - but the sim gameplay itself is great. When it came out, it pretty much blew the competition out of the water. You know, just like the ships in the game itself.\n\nThe graphics and presentation are still good and realistic for a 1997 game; although obviously dated it has a certain charm. Just wait until it's on sale so you actually get decent value, and yes, it does go on sale. Kudos to Valve and Sonalysts for having it on Steam in the first place, too.\n\n\nGameplay consists of navigating your vessel, an improved Los-Angeles class submarine, and completing objectives such as sinking enemy ships and laying mines.\n\nTo get a general idea of what it's like, this is a boat that sails under the water. Your primary means of figuring out where the Hell you are involves bouncing sound waves off everything - which is called sonar as it sounds cool - because you sure as schei√üe don't have any windows. You may feel that this isn't as easy as navigating in a regular boat (well, regular boat simulator anyway) and you'd be right.\n\nAnd that's just basic sailing. When you're facing enemy vessels, it can get pretty tense. Overall, when you learn enough to get the hang of it, 688(I) can make for a good challenge. You can also upgrade your sub and your crew between missions with earned points, and change your weapons loadout while in port.\n\nI have not played far enough into the campaign missions yet to really judge the plot or tone of the game. Suffice to say however, 688(I) Hunter-Killer is a hardcore military simulation. You don't play this just for the story. From what I've gathered so far, it's strait-laced enough that you'll probably feel like an actual Navy officer - any moral objections you may encounter will have to come from your own self. There is the option of ending your mission at any point, which if you haven't completed many objectives will get you chewed out. You cannot, however, talk back or go AWOL.\n\n\nThe submarine controls themselves are sensibly laid out and pretty easy to use once you know how. Of course, this game made the Guinness Book of World Records 1999-2000 as 'Most Intellectually Challenging PC Game', and while I probably wouldn't call it the hardest game in existence anymore, I'd say the difficulty still holds up. It's certainly far from impossible and pretty fun to learn the ship's systems, but operating them under pressure is another thing. Having the assistants enabled helps.\n\nYou unfortunately cannot access any proper tutorials in-game. There are tutorial missions available to play, short tutorial videos in the game directory accessible from the splash screen and a comprehensive PDF manual is included. You will need to read the manual - I recommend putting it on a tablet to consult while underway.\n\nAll that said, 688(I) was released in 1997. It may not run that well on modern systems, even if it runs well on mine (Windows 10 64-bit). The naval combat packs it comes in are rather pricey, too; you should wait for a sale.\n\n\nThe Steam version of 688(i) is the latest patched version, 1.08, initially a re-release of the game in 2006. Random fun fact: this game used to be published by EA.\n\nThis game's music is of special mention. It's around 8 or so MIDI tracks, and it's the sort of techno-suspense stuff you might hear from a more subdued Tom Clancy film. You can download it here and get some of the songs from the game remixes in MP3 format from here[community.simtropolis.com]. They're very good and very appropriate.\n\nYou can also watch the special promo/press kit/B roll video they release here[archive.org]. Pretty fascinating glimpse into development, plus some gameplay on a period computer that's laughably slow compared to today.","September 23, 2014","true","17.6"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","21","22","2","15"

You mean I have to learn stuff? I don't want that. I just want to jump into an FPS and play deathmatch with my buds".\n\nIf that is your mindset then I'm afraid this game is not for you.\n\nWhat you have here is a highly detailed technical simulation of a modern-day fast attack submarine. When I say "modern" I mean 1997, but I don't think they've changed much since then. And don't let the original release date throw you off; this "game" is much more sophisticated than any games made today. And for 1997 it's a virtual milestone. The development company (Sonalysts) actually specializes in combat sims and they have worked closely with the U.S. Navy in producing training programs. They have developed other sub sims, which are also on Steam. The point being: they know their stuff!\n\nIf you want something with more visual flair then I would highly suggest any WW2 sub sim, especially any of the Silent Hunter games. As a matter-of-fact they are a must for anyone wanting to break into this genre. They will provide a basic understanding of how submarines work, and you won't be banging yourself over the head for making small mistakes. They are incredibly fun, and easy to jump in and learn too. Those will actually make learning the Sonalysts sims that much easier to comprehend. I'm no expert, however, and I only write this review as a student trying to help other students learn. WW2 sub sims have taught me a lot on a subject that, until a few months ago, I knew absolutely nothing about. Now I'm reading books on the subject and technical manuals as well.\n\nOf course this is not something for everyone. It's very technical and there are no in-game tutorials to help you out. Even die-hard sub sim fans may be intimidated by the complicated interface. You won't find any hand-holding here, and you won't see much in the way of visual representation. When you're in a real submarine you are actually swimming blind, and this game captures that as accurately as it can. Luckily it comes with quite a lengthy manual so you better study that hard before playing. I'm still new to sub sims myself, but I'm moving at such a fast rate and I'm trying to learn as much as I can. I've downloaded the game's manual to an e-reader to study while I'm offline and it's very insightful.\n\nThis game is for those players who want to take sub simulation to the next level. But does a learning curve mean that the game is not fun? Of course not, but the education is part of the reward.","August 17, 2015","true","5.4"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","16","18","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cyrelio/recommended/2900/","Cyrelio","Rev","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cyrelio/","203 products in account","This is a great submarine simulation game.  I felt right in the middle of the action, and there are definitely some tense moments, i.e. evading enemy torpedoes and stealthily sneaking up on an enemy submarine.  The game has a steep learning curve at first if you've never played anything like it before.  I recommend reading the captain's manual if you want some early pointers on how to learn the basics.  Some of the missions take multiple hours to complete, and I found it easy to lose myself in the game.  It's got simplistic graphics, as it is an older game.  On Windows 7 platforms, I've noticed that the game doesn't run as reliably as older versions of Windows, i.e. random crashing in the middle of missions for no reason.  That seems to be one of the only downfalls that I have come across.  Other than that, definitely a thumbs up.","June 26, 2014","true","2.2"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","17","20","0","0"

Once you get the hang of it, it gets fun.  Expect to spend 10 hours or so getting the hang of it, if not more.  This game is fairly bug-free.  It has a campaign which is 'ok'.  The campaign debriefings are intentionally cheesy, I think it sort of loses some realism there but it's also a bit funny, so it's a wash.  It could stand to use some extra features that were included with the sequel, Sub Command, but I wouldn't recommend that one due to the overwhelming bugs.","April 7, 2015","true","28.9"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LifePilgrim/recommended/2900/","LifePilgrim","Life Pilgrim","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LifePilgrim/","157 products in account","I played Sub Command during my undergraduate years and was hooked to it. Played it all night long every Saturday at my dorm. I then bought Dangerous Waters which improved upon it. I never tried 688(I) Hunter/Killer although I heard it was an excellent game. That is until today. On my first try I fell in love with it. The gameplay feels better than both Sub Command and Dangerous Waters primarily due to the better interface design. They even put 3D layout of the submarine interior and a 3D view that's uniquely attached to one of the stations available to you. Somehow, this makes the gameplay shines a lot more than it does in Sub Command or Dangerous Waters.\n\nTruly a classic that's very much still enjoyable in the present day. If commanding a modern submarine piques your interest this is a must buy still even in 2016. They made games like no other back then. To think that a 1997 game still has a lot to offer even in 2016 is a testament to how well thought this game is.\n\nYes, it is superior to Sub Command and Dangerous Waters in gameplay, except for the graphics and number of playable platforms. The mechanics of the games are identical just the addition of 3D interior layout, no matter how simple, and the simplicity of contact management make 688(I) Hunter/Killer that much more realistic and enjoyable. They don't even bother to give you the 'Turns per Knot' values of commercial ships as it should be since otherwise the U.S. Navy would have to record every single merchant, commercial, and civilian ship's engine. Maybe they do record the engine signature of the biggest commercial ships but I don't think they record every single  ship inclucding its TPK value. Smaller nations may also use smaller TPK database or even none at all. The 'Turns Per Knot' value is probably related to the design of propeller and the ship's tonnage as well as the ship's keel/hull design. So, the limited 'Turn Per Knot' data in the game made it even more realistic in my opinion.\n\nThe only downside is there are not that many enemy ships and submarines for you to target.\n\nGameplay description:\nMy first game was enemy boomer (SSBN) hunting. Couple rebel controlled Delta IVs are in dsignated Op Area and I need to kill them. Intelligence suggests that they may be escorted by enemy SSNs and that it is best to leave the SSNs alone until I get the boomers to avoid alerting the rebels into launching their ICBMs. Early in game, I detected a Victor II SSN and I couldn't help but to plot the best solution I could do and launched two Mk. 48 ADCAP at it. The ADCAPS sank the SSN much to my joy.\n\nMy second try was the campaign. I am ordered to approach Cuba's south coast to disembark a SEAL team. Intelligence suggests couple Koni FFGs or the likes patroling the area. There is also a Foxtrot missing from port. So, I approach Cuba's south coast under thermal layer. There was quite a traffic of commercial shipping above. Couple hours later, my sonar detected a strong contact above layer and it was the Foxtrot. I couldn't avoid it as we were just too close. The layer had concealed it from me and I had been to them. But not anymore. The order was weapon tight and to only fire when fired upon. So I reduced speed but the Foxtrot detected me and decided to turn around to tail me while pinging me. How embarrasing..........The SEAL team will be captured if I disembark them couple hours from now.","April 6","true","3.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
