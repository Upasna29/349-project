Yes, you're in a plane and you're shooting down planes (and boats and blimps), but what it really is frenetic aerial bullet hell chaos. But what makes Luftrausers so good, besides the action and stylized graphics, are the controls. Your plane is insanely maneuverable, able to turn on a dime, reach top speed in a moment. That level of control makes a difference.\n\nIt's one thing to weave between some bullets and return fire. It's another to swoop into a dive, deftly plummet through a hail storm of bullets, take out a projectile-spewing battleship, and pull up so close that the water's surface is flared up by your thrusters.\n\nIt's one thing to shoot down some planes. It's another to maneuver your enemies into a tight cluster, cut your thrusters, and shoot the planes pursuing you while your momentum carries you in the other direction. (And it helps that just activating your thrusters is so satisfying, thanks to the awesome fwhoosh sound effect)\n\nIt's fast, it's hard as hell, it's addictive. The music is great. The visuals are simple, yet suit the game perfectly, displaying all the information you need to know without cluttering the onscreen spectacle. Each new part you unlock feels different, a new tool to master, Luftrausers isn't the most complex game, but it's certainly one of the most addictive and satisfying I've played in a while. I'd say it's up there with One Finger Death Punch, in terms of a simple experience that's laser focused on delivering finely tuned fun gameplay. It's the kind of game where I'm instantly restarting upon defeat, to improve my skills, complete missions, unlock new parts.","March 18, 2014","true","2.8"," 703 of 757 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","703","757","0","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/recommended/233150/","pepsimanvsjoe","pepsimanvsjoe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/","1281 products in account","A fallacious argument regarding arcade games is that they're designed solely to take your money. If anything, arcade games make you value your money. Think about it, your life is represented by a mere quarter. With practice that quarter could take you anywhere you want to go. For most of us nowadays, the only exposure to arcade games is through the occasional port or MAME. We've lost sight of how much a quarter is worth.\n\nWhat a lot of arcade-style games get wrong is that they have too much content. They have a lot of fluff like epic intros, backstories, dozens of stages, freakin' level-ups. I don't play an arcade game for all that filth, I want a good challenge, I want the action to start seconds after I begin. Luftrausers understands what makes an arcade game work, and it's fantastic.\n\nSo uh...there's a war or something, you're a pilot, and oh who cares? You're either very skilled or exceptionally lucky to survive five minutes of this hell. The goal is to fly around, shoot down enemy fighters, destroy their boats, wreck their aces, sink their battleships, obliterate their subs, and probably wipe out their airships. One element of a good arcade game is that you can grasp its mechanics and controls in seconds. The enemy numbers are overwhelming but dodging and returning fire is seamless and impeccably designed. Your goals are simply to improve hi-score, complete various missions, and unlock parts.\n\nWhoa back up, unlock parts? What is this? It's actually a very clever system. The parts in this game aren't just +1 to armor or +3 to fire-power. They change up the player's entire style and strategy. There are a multitude of weapon, body, and engine combinations. Finding the one that suits you is all part of the fun. For example, having a propellor equipped allows the player's ship to not take damage underwater. When the heat becomes a little too much, it's possible to duck into the sea for a quick breather. Couple this with the laser cannon and enemies can be destroyed while firing from underwater. Every combination leads to various changes in how every game is played, and with each attempt lasting minutes at the most, there's a lot of ideas to play around with.\n\nWhat makes this such a smartly-designed game is that it does a lot with very little. There are maybe 7 or 8 enemy-types in the entire game, but they're used just right to make every game feel fresh. Changing the parts of your ship or focusing on different objectives can also make every attempt feel different from the last. I've gotten more than a couple hours out of this tiny game precisely because it knows what works and runs with it.\n\nDefinitely pick up Luftrausers if you haven't already. If you're the bundle-purchasing type it has to be in your library already. If not...well...oops? Grab it during the next sale, or buy it right now. Just play this game next chance you get, it's definitely worth it.","September 23, 2014","true","4.6"," 150 of 179 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","150","179","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/233150/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","LUFTRAUSERS is a bullet hell airplane based game, being released on PC, PS3 and Vita in early 2014.\n\nGame play is quite simple, you are in control of a airplane and you have to take on hundreds and hundreds of other enemy fighters coming at you from all angles. This game allows your plane to fly in all 360 degrees. Your main weapon will shoot from the front of your plane, you also have to take into consideration things like gravity, stalling and drifting whilst dodging all of the oncoming enemies.  Initially the controls seem very hard to get a grasp of, but once you work out how the plane flies and how you are supposed to control it, it becomes almost second nature. I would say it took me at least an hour to get to grips with the controls.\n\nGraphically, the game has a very minimalist look to it. Whilst there is little detail gone into the planes and their silhouettes, you still feel like you are actually there in the skies shooting the planes down yourself.  They could of quite easily made this look like a many of the other flight games on Steam, I think its the graphics and art style that most people will remember this game for.\n\nThere isn't really any story or plot to follow in LUFTRAUSERS. I also didn't really want one too; it's perfectly fine for a game not to have a plot I think. After all, your character can nose dive your plane into an enemy battleship, reap the rewards from it and move onto the next character without batting an eyelid.\n\nThe game also has a kind of rogue-like feel to it, after each level, you are able to customize your plane with different weapons and armor, and you keep all of the updates even after you die, along with any levels and points you have earned. Eventually you'll get more powerful and be able to simply overpower some stages purely because your plane will be kitted up so much.\n\nLUFTRAUSERS is a very hard game. I have died countless times, you just need to get used to it - there is no way around it. But if you preserver through, you'll soon be able to break through that wall you have been pounding your head on for an hour and beat the challenges that are set at the start of each level.  In order for me to reach the "end", it took me just over five hours. For me it felt just about right as I think it would really start to get tedious if I had to keep playing.\n\nThis is probably a game you will want to dip into now and then, and not do a full stint of it like me, to get maximum fun out of it, just play it for twenty minutes at a time. The game is also highly recommended you use a game pad too; I tried with keyboard and it was just horrendous to control.\n\nTo sum up, LUFTRAUSERS is a nicely put together indie title with some interesting elements; bullet-hell fans will absolutely adore it, and this is really a good game to play if you have five or ten minutes to spare as no level will ever last longer than that. The price tag of £6,99 makes it an absolute bargain for anyone.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

I enjoyed it for the first hour, maybe two hours, but in the end the sudden drop off of entertainment and other drawbacks forced me to not recommend this game.\n\nThe game lacks good progression/unlockable balance. There is overall goals and levels but also each item comes with different unlockable goals. This is the only reason you would bother using most options beyond a one time try to "see what they are". Basically the system forces you to use items you don't prefer. But if like most people you find a weapon/armor/boost combo you prefer and play it often you run the risk of grinding your overall score up which is connected to your level progression... Which changes the spawn rates of enemies. And that's where the balance is quickly lost. There's one "right" way to progress and even if you did it and methodically unlocked each upgrade's goals as you got them without wasted plays I still doubt it would stay balanced. And this isn't a complaint about difficulty!\n\nI like a challenge and this game gives it when you get a lot of enemies at once. But the spawning balance just ruins a reasonable chance at a goal and makes it a lottery. Luck isn't a challenge, it is just luck. Skill goes out the window. And you do get to the point where you tap out. The goals you have left indeed become purely luck based or based on enemy spawns that rarely if ever cooperate. The game goes from a steady two hours of fun challenge of unlocks and goals... To a test of  your willpower to grind and grind with items you don't like until you literally get lucky and win the lottery.\n\nWhich I guess points out one last flaw. Without the goals this game loses all of it's appeal. With runs so short it isn't rewarding in any way to just play for "fun" without a goal. An average run is under a minute. This makes playing it like an arcade game just going for a high score both pointless and repetitive.\n\nHad some fun playing it. It was a challenge at times and the gameplay felt tight. It was a pleasure to look at stylistically too. But then the fun ended. Completely. Beyond being a throw in game in a bundle I can't recommend it. And it isn't a reason to get a bundle either. The price is way out of balance with what you actually get; A way out of balance short game.","September 12, 2014","false","4.3"," 72 of 102 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","72","102","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/amedeus8/recommended/233150/","amedeus8","Comrade St. Nikolai","http://steamcommunity.com/id/amedeus8/","779 products in account","Luftrausers is a small, arcade-style game that packs a punch... if that's the sort of thing you're into.\n\nThe thing with Luftrausers is, not everyone's going to like it. I don't want to convince you that it's good, I want to tell you about it and let you make that decision. There is no story mode. There are no levels. It's one area, you fly around, you shoot as many things as you can, you die, repeat.\n\nFirst off, let's talk about that. It's a game about flying around in an advanced German fighter plane machine thing and shooting up the enemies. Various airborne and seaborne war vehicles will try to shoot you down. And, sooner or later, they will succeed.\n\nProbably sooner.\n\nYour controls are a surprising part of what makes the game fun. You have your propulsion, which will move you forward. You also have right and left, which will turn you. Gravity is a thing here, it's not your typical bullet hell. But gravity is what allows you to perform cool aerial maneuvers. Fly directly up, stall your craft, then fall down past your enemies and blast upward at them. Laying back into the propulsion at the last minute to fly off to the side and dodge a battleship's bullets, of course.\n\nNow, there are two things which add replayability, here. First, is the diversity in equipment. You begin the game with a basic machine gun, basic aircraft body, and basic propulsion system. As you go, you unlock four more of each, all of which completely change how your craft performs and operates. One type of propulsion lets you go underwater without taking damage. One weapon is a continuous laser beam which hinders your turn speed when in use. One body is a nuke which destroys almost anything around when you die. Which, actually, that last one's a ton more useful than it sounds.\n\nWhich brings me to the other thing. Missions. Each piece of equipment has a series of missions attached to it. Complete one, unlock the next. These are things like destroying so many of something, or blowing something up with a full combo going. Some are a little more outside the box, but there you go. Once you complete all of the normal missions, one final mission unlocks, which must be completed in SFMT mode, which is, for lack of a better label, hard mode. This unlocks the first time you destroy a blimp. And good luck with that. You're going to need it. And you're going to need it even more when you actually start SFMT mode.\n\nCompleting missions nets you skulls, and as you unlock enough or level up, you unlock new equipment. Once all of the equipment is unlocked, you unlock palettes. The basic palette is a sort of retro-beige affair. My favorite was the first one I unlocked, titled "Videodreaming", which is sort of indigo and pink, and honestly looks really cool. Most of the others I unlocked were eyesores, so there's a thing to be aware of.\n\nThat's honestly about all there is to it. You swoop and loop and blow stuff up and complete challenges and unlock things. I wouldn't expect to get TONS of time out of Luftrausers. But a few hours would be natural. If that all sounds appealing, then check it out.","February 15, 2015","true","5.8"," 32 of 37 people (86%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","86","32","37","4","1"

There's no deep story or hero with a traumatic past here. Just you gunning down countless waves of scum who deny you the right to the skies.\n\nHere's a video giving you my first impressions of the game. Although given how short it is, you may be able to consider it a review.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/l1Fuvydgcp4\n\nFor those of you who want a short and dirty summary, I'll break it down for you with pros and cons.\n\n+ Challenging gameplay. There isn't a point where you'll ever be bored with how easy something is.\n+ Great replayability. No game will ever play the same, especially when you throw in all the different plane parts into the mix.\n+ Lots of different playstyles. You can fly everything from a plane that spearheads through destroyers to a meaty clunker that fires a laser and poops bullets.\n+ Smooth, responsive gameplay. Nothing feels clunky and everything responds when you do it.\n+ Every shade of yellow you can find is here. Bask in its yellow glory! (Though you can change the scheme when you level up, but why?)\n\n- Extremely short. After playing 3 hours, I've practically done everything in the game.\n- Some of the weapons just aren't as good as others in my opinion. The homing missiles seem to have a lot of trouble hitting their target, even massive destroyers that barely move. Limiting you to 4 at a time makes it even more frustrating when they don't hit what they're supposed to. The cannon is similar, as it only allows one shot at a time, and if you miss, you have a lot of downtime between shots. And in a game as fast-paced as this, missing happens often.\n- Sometimes enemies just don't spawn and come after you. It makes it hard to bump up combos and get more points, allowing the more interesting enemies trying to gun you down.\n- Sometimes the game can be cheap and send 3 destroyers at you at a time with a few ace pilots to boot. At that point, you're just not gonna live with the amount of things on screen.\n\n\nAll in all, I recommend you pick this game up when you want an excellent time waster. Even when it goes up to 10 dollars, it'll still be worth it. But if you don't like the fact that it is so short, feel free to wait until it goes on sale. You won't be disappointed either way.","March 18, 2014","true","4.0"," 32 of 40 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","32","40","0","0"

Runs perfectly on linux, only minor issue is lack of an exit button.\n\nI was hesitant to pick this game up, due to the artstyle that seemed lazy in the screenshots and the general simplicity of bullet hell games. I was expecting this to be a cheap "So retro" game. However, when it went on sale and I noticed it was published by Devolver Digital (who have yet to back a stray horse) I decided to give it a go. I'm glad I did and I would recommend this game at full price.\n\nThis game reminds me of old arcade classic Aerial Dogfight, except with everything turned to the max. You begin with only the most basic machine gun and engine, then when you die you've discovered that you have a new engine that lets you move twice as fast at the cost of turning speed, a few more deaths later you're erupting out of the ocean and obliterating everything with a laser strapped to a chassis which is a nuclear bomb.\n\nThe game offers a lot of upgrade potential, it's surprisingly balanced. There's no combination which felt leagues better than the rest, Although your basic machinegun, chassis and engine feel outdated by the end, nothing you have earned will feel pointless.\n\nThe constant flow of gameplay challenges associated with each weapon encourages you to diversify your tactics. This prevents the fact that the game only offers one level and one mode from becoming tedious. One downside of these challenges is that the curve on them is a little bit off. The final challenges are magnitudes more difficuklt than the ones that came before it, and something such as defeating a submarine at MAX combo feels far more luck based than it does skill based.\n\nThe only real downside I could say against this game is that once you've completed all the challenges, there's not much to do but try for the high-score. That's not even a problem either with a relatively short round time and tight polished gameplay. I can see myself coming back to this many times in the future.","October 24, 2014","true","6.9"," 21 of 29 people (72%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","72","21","29","2","0"

Videos might give you some idea.   I used to play the prototype flash game for hours and that was without any upgrades or any of the new stuff.  The minimal graphics are amazingly detailed, from debres and shrapnel flying from your plane and enemies, to smoke and bullets and even water dripping off after you splash down.\n\nThe controls are very solid, and relay the power and abilities of the chosen engine well.  High tech engines feel snappy and powerful and the odd-job (bullet) engines feel sluggish and less responsive.  Once you learn to steer well, the game really opens up and is amazingly entertaining.\n\nWell that is until a jet screams onto your screen and smashes you into tiny pixels.\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone that enjoys shooters, bullet hell, action rogue-lites.\n\nAnd since a friend of a friend saw on some forum that this is a free flash game, let me set the record straight.  It began life as a ULTRA simple version of the current game a long time ago. And while the prototype is still available, the full version adds missions, and level / upgrade system and many more enemies and is totally worth the few bucks.  Although the prototype will give you a basic feel of how the game plays (keyboard and mouse only I believe) the full version offers controller support.\n\nAnd I mean, who doesn't want to support some of the most awesome indie devs around?\n\n9/10 Anyday.","March 18, 2014","true","4.8"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

Incidentaly I picked this up in a Humble Bundle, but already before I start this review I'd say that it is definitly worth full price!\nLuftrausers is an oldschool arcade style game, with focus on racking up as many points as possible, while sustaining a multiplier. To do this you gun down hundreds of planes, ships, and various modifications and bosstypes of these.\nThe game does however feature some progression, in that you will be offered various jobs to complete, and by doing that you will progressively unlock parts to your plane, which comes with more jobs to do. There is also colourschemes to unlock,  since the artstyle is uses a simple 4-5 colour pallette.\nThe unlockable parts gives a whole lot of vararity, and there's a bunch of different playstyles, depending on how you combine your plane. Personally I'm a big fan of the laser+melee body+booster engine combo.\nGameplay continues to be fun, and even after you have completed all jobs and unlocked all parts, there is more to do, a hardcore mode will unlock, which is really hardcore. You will basically die within seconds, and this mode comes with additional jobs to do.\nLuftrausers is ultmatively a bunch of fun, with flying mechanics that feel really awesome, and gamplay that keeps on giving. It does however run in some wierd aspect ratio (most likely 4:3) and there is no way to make it wide screen as far as I have seen, but this doesn't really detract from the game in any way.\n\nI would definitly reccomend this game if you are into arcade style games with scores and multipliers. Or if you just want to waste some time shooting thing out of a brown sky.\nGo get it!","October 10, 2014","true","7.3"," 20 of 28 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","20","28","0","0"

All the parts you can customise your plane with are distinct and force different play styles.\n\nIt's a solid foundation for a good game, but the scoring and enemy spawning system is screwed up and destroys any appeal to seeking high scores.  Luck will determine if you can carry a full score multiplier (and it's a big multiplier) because sometimes small planes and boats don't spawn often enough.  Sometimes four or five big, deadly planes will spawn at once and spell doom for all but a few specific plane part combos.  The game derives its longevity instead through hiding the different plane parts behind missions, many of which only ask you be persistent than skillfull (accumulate X points over however many tries it takes).

I will say that the game is pretty fun on its own, with an interesting theme going on. It's basically a bullet-hell game (with, I'd argue, some rogue-like elements). Point of the game is to las as long as you can over dangerous waters, fighting bots, planes and Zeppelins. I will say that the gameplay is really solid and interesting; you'll be flying all over the place while shooting, and can even cut off your engines to pull off maneuvers to get the edge on your enemies. It's a good arcade experience that you should have some fun with, and that's added with the unlocks that you get from completing challenges. The unlocks include new bodies of the plane, as well as weapons, wings, and engines. These pieces have their own stats, but also have a few interesting quirks, an example being an engine that shoots bullets. With the customization, it's a good bit of fun.\n\nSo why is it cautious, you ask? Well, what cuts this game off from being great is its price at ten dollars which, in my opinion, is very overpriced. While the action is hectic, you'll be fighting in the same area and with the same enemies over and over and over again. On top of that, while the unlocks are great fun, there are too few to unlock (I got all of them at the 1.5 mark). It really isn't that hard to get all of the items in this game. Once you unlock all of your parts and essentially the hard mode, the only thing to strive for afterwards is completing challenges (which kind of loses its luster once everything is unlocked). Don't get me wrong, it's a fun game, but I'd highly recommend you buy it one it's on sale. Got my copy on Chronogg for a dollar fifty, which I think is a much more fair price.\n\nAll in all, a fun game, but doesn't offer enough for its asking price.","April 27","true","4.7"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

Yes, Luftrausers does let you be a crazy plane badass. Sadly, that's about the only good point.\n\nThe whole thing feels like an Iphone game, but brings almost enough excitement that it could qualify as a real game. Runs are short. You'll die within 5 minutes, easily. The score system is arbitrary and meaningless for the very same reason I cannot recommend the game.\n\nBeyond the fighters, every other enemy simply takes too much damage to kill. By the game you have made the five or so passes needed to kill a battleship, three more have spawned, and they will ALL be training their sights on you while you try to kill the others. And you have boats, planes, subs, and jets to deal with while you're trying to ice these. The score system relies on a chaining mechanic and every single tough enemy takes more damage to kill than it takes your chain to drop, so you can only hope to play for score by hoping the RNG throws you a bunch of suicidal popcorn fighters and jets. The big bad blimp boss of the game is a total pushover unless you have to fight it while two dozen battleships also try to nail you from below but he may as well take twice as much sustained fire as you have put out since the game started to get him to show up and fight. The enemy variety is just tedious and sucks the fun out of the game beyond that initial rush where you duplicate the preview video's cool tricks.\n\nLike an Iphone game, you can do three objectives each time to unlock parts to customize your plane and they're really the actual goal of the game as they block all the unlocks and provide you the only sort of direction you get beyond getting shot at. The plane parts are roughly 25% cool, 75% stupid, and share the same loose, uninspiring design as the basic game. Some change core mechanics in fundamental ways but they are not enough to save the game.\n\n$10 for a tight arcade experience would be a no brainer but Luftrausers just does not have that spark that makes an arcade game fun. You won't come back to it months later to revisit the fond memories. It burns out too quick and does not leave much beyond the flash... Which is a shame as a lot of love and care went into the glitz and the flash and the style of it but a little more should have went into tightening the gameplay.","April 9, 2014","false","9.1"," 52 of 88 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","52","88","0","0"

Compete for the highest score in a Weird War setting and blow everything up while dodging wave after wave of enemy planes and ships. It's a simple idea, but Vlambeer managed to get the most out of it by introducing missions (which are basically small objectives you can complete on every attempt for a high score) and unlocking parts in the process. New parts have different properties and change your playstyle dramatically, it gets even crazier when you realize you can mix'n'match various parts in order to creat the Luftrauser of your dreams. I don't want to spoil some of the surprises, but a lot of the combinations you can create are pretty badass and really fun to fly.\n\nIt's incredibly well thought out and pretty much pure fun in the beginning, unlocking stuff left and right, rising in rank and enjoying the super-stylish presentation. Seriously, the visuals are fantastic - just single-colored shapes, but so full of character with great silhouettes. It's a little masterpiece visually, really. The sound is excellent too, particularly the music gets you excited and supports the action nicely. The soundeffects, while a bit more subtle than one would expect, add a nice layer to the overall soundscape and complement the experience nicely. Presentation is top notch and reason alone to get this, especially if you care about aesthetics.\n\nThere is a pretty rough learning curve and becoming a Top-Rauser is no easy task. Mastering the maneuverability of each plane and learning when to accelerate, stall and rise as well as figuring out the various weaponsystems is key to survival and higher scores. Unfortunately, once the initial rush wears down the game started losing a bit of it's appeal for me - eventually you will have to take down a certain enemy to advance in missions and considering the somewhat randomized nature of enemy spawns this can lead to a lot of frustration. All the things that make the game great in the beginning are getting  annoying at that point, you get kind of stuck and the game never lets up (in fact, it only ever gets harder from there). Unfortunately, this means it starts to get repetitive after a while. Especially when no progress is made, motivation is dwindling fast because there is not much meat to the game other than dogfighting for score and experimenting with different loadouts - which wasn't keeping me interested a couple of hours in. Up until that point however, you will have played hundreds of games and enjoyed yourself a lot - the title sure manages to make you play "just one more round" and that is always the mark of a great game.\n\nOverall it was an intense arcade-experience for me, and I would suggest that you give LUFTRAUSERS a try if you want to play something different that is easy to learn and very hard to master. Just try to not make the same mistake that I did and burn yourself out on it and you are good to go.","April 8, 2014","true","10.1"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","15","20","0","0"

The shooting is really satisfying, unlocking new parts feels really make a difference, and the contextual bgm really kick-♥♥♥.\n\nThis game is really the crowning achievement of "Let's play this for five minutes... whelp it's 1 hour already."\n\nBut there really isn't many content in this game, so that's that. After you unlock all parts and do all missions (challenges), you only try to beat high score. Strangely, I think this game would be more fulfilling to those who are not that good in this kind of shmup game, because they'll have longer time unlocking everything. But of course shmup veteran would get a kick from trying to beat high scores.\n\nBasically, recommended, but buy this discounted if you're concerned with the small amount of content.","May 6","true","15.7"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

There are 5-6 parts in each category depending on how many you unlock, giving you well over 100 different combinations. Each body part is unique and provides its own sets of strengths and weaknesses depending on your play style.\n\n+ Every body part you choose has 5 bonus objectives for you to complete giving you something to play for other than a high score. For example certain objectives may include 'kill 5 planes in one play session', 'destroy a battleship', 'kill a ship at max combo etc'.\n\n+ The game has the "one more time' feeling. The game can be very addicting as you try to get new high scores or complete objectives\n\n+Two difficulty modes to test your skills, normal and hard\n\n+Solid Soundtrack\n\nThe Average:\n\nThe UI leaves something to be desired, it could have been a lot easier to navigate menu screens. Given the context of the game there really is no reason to have a UI that isn't simple and easy to navigate.\n\nThe game can be very short if you don't care about achievements or high score, getting some of the bonus objectives can be time consuming and not worth the hassle.\n\nConclusion:\n\nI am not the biggest fan of Shoot 'em ups but this game is the perfect pick up and play arcade game to kill some time. Its highly addicting and trying out all the different ship parts to find the right combination that fits your play style is part of the fun.\n\n","March 16, 2015","true","5.2"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

The controls is what makes this game brilliant, it will certainly test your perception, timing and skill to avoid the barrage of gunfire whilst maintaining your kills to max out your combo for a serious score.\n\nThe controls are similar to that old skool game gravity, where you control a small space ship and you have to land it on the landing pad.....right left and down will spin your plane whilst up is your thrusters to fly.

Your objective is to survive as long as possible, taking down as many opponents as you can. Game is hard, death can occur within seconds of starting and your score is ranked online.\n\nMoving left or right will change the direction your plane will face, pushing up activates the boosters, and trigger fires your weapon. There is no limit to ammo. Controls are tight, dodging bullets and shooting the enemy has you switching your boosters on and off. You take damage by being shot at by the enemy, flying into enemy planes or ships, and staying too long in the clouds or water. All damage can be repaired by not firing for a few seconds.\n\nYou start off with a fast balanced plane, accomplishing objectives tied to your loadout (you can alter the engine, guns and body) and levelling up will unlock new choices. The new body, engine and gun types can be mixed and matched for different combinations, each giving a different play style; turn your ship into a battering ram, attach heat-seeking missiles, drop bombs on enemies below or sink into the sea without taking damage. There are many combinations to try and they do a great job in stopping the game from going stale.\n\nDefault colour scheme is light brown, dark red and white; different colour filters can be unlocked (though none of them are to my taste). Music is very good and the sound effects have a nice 'oompf' feel to it.\n\nIf there is anything I would like to change is that a few more load out options would be welcomed and the cutscenes would be a bit longer.\n\nTL;DR: hard but fun bullet-hell game. One map, but made highly replayable by combining different parts of the plane.","May 1, 2014","true","8.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

In Triplane Turmoil, momentum is everything - you have a narrow band of space between ground and sky, and your job is to occupy that space without getting shot down.  You have to maintain motion to keep from nosediving into the rocks, but a good pilot can stall into the perfect place to shoot their sibling's plane and pull out of the dive without taking damage.\n\n2. Crimsonland is top-down bullet hell done right - the "bullets" are zombies, and the only long-term way to dodge them is by killing them.  The only way to kill them effectively is to internalize the dodging mechanics so that one half of your brain handles the feet, weaving around the monsters, with the other half of your brain working on aiming in such a way as to make sure that you can keep dodging a few more precious seconds.\n\n3. It took me a few hours to catch it, but Luftrauser also reminds me of Uniball.  Uniball is soccer with spaceships, a weird futuristic air hockey viewed from the top down.  As a younger man I dedicated thousands of hours to playing online, but when bored I would even fire up the "single-player" mode without any other players, just to practice dribbling and moving.  Momentum is a huge part of the game, and I would practice shooting and passing while constantly spinning, limiting myself to only a few direction keys to force myself to use momentum with perfect efficiency.\n\nLuftrauser is an arcade-intense game that asks you to dodge with one brain, use your other brain to shoot speedy bad guys out of the air (with MAX COMBO), and if you're really leet, gives you a spatial playground to express yourself in with all the spinning, stalling, and lasers that my childhood gamer's heart so deeply desires.\n\nAnd also the soundtrack is super-awesome, the aesthetics are gorgeous, and the upgrades and goals are excellently crafted and all that other stuff.  But really, that's just the devs showing off after creating a beautiful Game.","March 31, 2014","true","12.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Sorry, I’ve been told by publishers Devolver Digital that LUFTRAUSERS must only be shouted when mentioned. That is true, because LUFTRAUSERS is something to shout about.\n\nLUFTRAUSERS is an indie arcade shooter by developers Vlambeer and the objective of the game is …to shoot everything! Presented as a 2D side-scrolling “wrap around screen” shoot ‘em up similar to old-old school games like 80′s Defender or 90′s Jetstrike your mission is to take to the skies and dodge, dip, dive, duck, dodge and finally BLAST anything that’s BLASTING at you! Enemies will come at you from all directions and in various forms. Ships, carriers and subs take pot shots from the sea and a menagerie of exotic planes (and a Zeppelin!) in the air that will engage in dog fights with you (or try and suicide themselves). As you progress things become more and more hectic to a dizzying degree as the amount going on at once escalates exponentially over 100 levels.\n\nThankfully as you play the game you complete challenges, level up and gain access to more and more aviation unlocks. In total 125 different combinations of weapons, armour and propulsion systems become available which vary wildly from thicker armour (which naturally gives you more protection, but then decreases your speed), guided missiles (that chase your target but only limited to shooting 4 at a time) or the more wacky “engine that fires bullets when you fly”. This diversity is a unique selling point of the game and getting the knack of each loadout and finding the best configuration to suit you or the scenario is key. For example I’m currently sporting an anti-gravity engine to stay in the air with minimal thrust, a laser which is less powerful than the machine gun but allows for constant damage over time and a light chassis to boost myself out of trouble …which is frequent.\n\nAnother plus is that the controls are minimal. No beefy manual on aeronautics or diploma for aerospace engineering required here lads! For the PC version of the game the up arrow gives you forward thrust, left and right turn you in a clockwise or counter-clockwise movement and ‘X’ fires your gun. Stop firing, and your plane repairs itself. Double tap thrust to give you a boost to (hopefully) speed you out of trouble. Simple? Well doing this under fire and the pressure of needing at times some pin-point precession of Maverick, it’s tough and times quite unforgiving.\n\nVisual wise LUFTRAUSERS is presented (for the most part) in a sepia scheme. Images are simple and suitably retro, fitting to its heritage, while audio is catchy and 16-bit. The audible tone to indicate your planes damage and repair progress is a particularly nice touch as it allows players to not have to rely on a visual cue (such as a 100% bar) that could easily be distracting especially when so much is going on.\n\nOverall LUFTRAUSERS is another great example of an indie title that I’m sure will be recognised for its achievements. It’s (Warning: Indie Game Cliché Alert!) easy to learn, fun to play, cheap (which is important in this day and age) and has a good re-playability.

Free flying arcade-style bullet hell game with lots of customizable aircraft parts to keep you trying different combinations until you hit that sweet spot. There's countless combinations that will effect your combat style and even the sound track. 8bit graphics, marching music with thumping bass to keep you inspired while you fight off hordes of baddies with your super-advanced machine. The game scales up in difficulty the better you do and presents many challenges for endless replay value. I've dumped about ten hours into this game, even though there is only one map, and still haven't come close to completing it.

The goal is to get the highest score, by avoiding incoming rockets, planes and bullets. Kill enough enemies in one combo or reach a certain score and you'll unlock new parts for your aircraft. These parts might just help you get an even higher score. The parts are finely tuned and expertly balanced, so for example, increasing your damage might just make your aircraft fly/manoeuvre slower. You have to take things like that into account before taking off. You can adjust your engine, your weapon and your body and there are plenty of parts to unlock and use.\nLuftrausers is a fun game with some good music that's probably best played in smaller sessions.\n\n[Rating: 77/100]","March 29, 2014","true","4.6"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

In this game you fly a plane which I can only be assume to be consdier a Rauser. Durring your time in the game you will encounter many enimies and will be constantly outnumber and outguned. But there is no need to worry, thanks to nutty Sciencetist on your base ship your Rauser not only a litteral terror of the skies but also has the ablity to heal  yourslef when not fireing your main gun.\nIf you look up gameplay of this game what you see is pretty much all your getting. Flying over an ocen and shooting up your foes but you do have the option to unlock various things that will change up and give you incentive to keep playing.\n\nThe 1st thing that might intrest you is that you unlock parts of 3 interchangable catagories. Gun/Body/Engine. Each one of these catagories have a total of about 6 parts (I think) with the 6th of each catagory being an absolute grind of mental and pysical will to optain.    Each part is tied to its own Soundline for the game main soundtrack, which means each design you have will result in a slight variant of the theme which is pretty cool IMO\nAlso Each set of parts are given its own individual name (Which is around 6x6x6=216 names if you count up all the cobination)\n\nThe 2nd thing that might intrest you that the game has many color plannets presets which you unlock via the missions attach to each part (Makes the game look completly diffrent for better or worse).\nBefore I forget each part is tied to a mission of goal to achieve durring you run which leads to the general idea of more stuff and maybe a next mission if havn't completed a part's misson. The game will hold back on giving you more missions when you hit a roadblock which ussusally involves killing a certain enemy unit.\n\nThe 3rd thing that might intrest you with this game is that the matches themselves are very quick (around 3-7 mins depending on mode and skill). Which makes it a perfect game to just play a match to put down before you need to go BUT there is an issue with this game being extremly addicting as you get into it. Be sure to watch the clock while you're playing because on more than 1 occasion I played for hours non-stop untill it was 5am in the morning or I began to develope an headache\n\nIf there is an issue with this game, its the screen clutter when ♥♥♥♥ really starts blowing up all around you. (The exact time you whound't want to lose sight of where you are in the mess of hell and fire). The game is also at unchangable 30fps which isn't a problem overall while playing but I'm not sure if the visuals would be smoother if it was set to something higher.\n\nOverall I think its a good game to grab around the $5 mark. A game meant for people who like difficult skill-base rouge-likes, intresting meachnics and a great soundtrack that changes with the game and how low your Rauser life goes. Although a little bare overall when it comes to actually playing wize, the progression is slow enough with your unlocks and skill to give you a good bit a fun for a decently long while.\n","November 26, 2015","true","16.2"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","8","12","0","5"

TRY.  Here we go...\n\nI get the whole "retro" thing, I really do...up to a reasonable point.  I thought both Lone Survivor and Hotline Miami were very smart, resourceful games in their own ways...games which took their pixel-y limitations and arguably turned them into not only positives, but true aesthetic "decisions".  But does anybody really want or "need" a 2D shoot-'em-up THIS primitive and THIS ugly in this day and age?  I was at least expecting some interesting (read: semi-realistic) physics, but you literally just go up and down and in and out of the water (did real planes ever actually do this?) and perpetually hold down the fire button, 'cause frankly there doesn't seem much point in ever letting go out of it.  In fact I swear - and this may just be deluded childhood memories - but I honestly could swear that ASTEROIDS had more compelling physics than this.  And am I wrong, but do we basically see all there is to see in the first few minutes of gameplay?\n\nI'm honestly just bemused, more than anything.  But a quick glance at the overwhelmingly positive Steam reviews and a Metascore of EIGHTY - count 'em and weep, mother♥♥♥♥in' EIGHTY ya'll - suggests that I just don't know my shooters from my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and should probably just keep my unenlightened, fool mouth shut.  Maybe I just outgrew games this simplistic and primal when I was in my single digits, who knows...so in the interests of being open-minded, I'll just say...if it's a truly, defiantly "old-school" 2D shooter you're looking for, like the type you'd feed twenty cent coins into in the early 80s, then you may well find something to love here.  Me, I'm kinda glad video games have evolved past the stone age, even if the likes of Bioshock Infinite have arguably gone a little too far in the OPPOSITE direction.  Each to their own...\n\nVerdict: 4.5/10.","September 24, 2014","false","0.6"," 13 of 22 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","13","22","0","5"

As you rocket into the clouds with the hordes of enemy aces behind you, the engines on your plane cut as you begin to turn to face your oponents, but this is no accident. You push the throttle to the limit and fire your high powered laser beam cutting swathes through the sky. Fixated on the visceral and aerial carnage that encompasses your field of view, you pull out of your dive slicing the enemies to scrap with your custom bladed hull. All of this took place in a timespan of about 10 seconds, welcome to Luftrausers.\n\nThe music done by the amazingly talented Jukio Kallio (Kozilek) sets the tone for the aeronautical carnage, every different part for your plane (over 100 different combinations by the way) creates a new soundtrack for you to enter the danger zone to.\n\nLuftrausers is really damn good and for $9.99, an absolute steal and must have for any armchair adrenaline junkies.\n\nI would write more about the game, but I want to go back to playing it.\n\nDo yourselves a favor and pick up Luftrausers\n\nRaus/10","March 18, 2014","true","11.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

In a way it's a sign of change (and in a good way at that) that these types of games are getting main stream recognition, but in another lifetime it feels like LUFTRAUSERS would have just been a flash game, and would have been free.\n\nLUFTRAUSERS gimmick is its sepia hued. That’s basically it. Though you can unlock different hues, I never played with them, they looked awful.\n\nYes the world has moved on from flash portals and those kinds of games now have a new home called the App Store. So yes, it’s not outrageous in itself to be charging money for this style of game, but I do have issue with the amount. If I'd paid around £2, like many a game on the App Store, I'd have played it and walked away and felt like I got my money's worth, not saying I would have enjoyed it more, but I wouldn't have felt like I should have expected more. At £6.99 I feel like I should be getting more of a return for my investment.\n\nAll the incentive to play is; score attack and fulfilling objectives like ‘kill x of y’ or ‘get a score of z’, but that doesn’t really change how you’re going to play the game, you were going to be doing those anyway. The score attack or the objectives (I was never really clear which) unlock equipment for your plane, and while the game may boast more than 125 combinations, there's little incentive from the game itself to mix it up, just your own desire to experiment. Also, the later upgrades suck for the most part, for example the 'homing' missiles need a lot of coaxing to avoid them just nose diving into the sea.\n\nAnd that's fundamentally my problem; the game isn't much fun. You play within a single area, that appears to loop, that's quite tall, though enemy boats at the bottom can shoot you at the top of it, so flying to the top is only a disadvantage to yourself. The controls are simple, (though menu navigation is a chore as the button that accesses a given menu changes depending on current screen) yet somehow it never feels like you have complete control, it's only possible to make fine changes to direction, or complete changes, it feels like there's no mid ground, which makes trying to manoeuvre a pain. There are a number of different enemies, but there’s a gradual build up to the stronger enemies that the game follows, so in a game where you're expected to die a lot, you're going to see the same few over, and over, and over. Also, get used to that background music, you're going to be hearing that same small part of it every time too...\n\nThe game is certainly functional, and I guess that’s something to praise with the modern indie craze, a game being released in a non 'early access' form, but there's so little content provided and a generic shoot-'em-up experience at best.","May 15, 2014","false","4.4"," 30 of 56 people (54%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","54","30","56","2","0"

Incredibly good, even. You start it up for the first time and within a minute of playing it you'll be smiling broadly and wishing that every game could be as viscerally enjoyable as this one.\n\nThe controls have been honed to perfection. Simply flying around with the aircraft (is it called a Luftrauser?) is pleasing to the senses. Throughout the game, you'll unlock new parts that you can use to customize your plane, which come with both benefits and drawbacks. Here's where the true brilliance of the design comes in. Each part of the ship has its own instruments to add to the song that plays during the game, and each part has multiple missions that you can only complete with that part. So each combination of parts - and there's at least a hundred - offers a unique experience. To top it all off, every aircraft you can possibly assemble with these components has its own nickname, such as the Nightmare, the Tuberauser, or my current favorite, the Warturtle.\n\nIt's cheap, it's intense, and it's extremely challenging.

I like the variety of planes and ships you fight and the gameplay mechanics are very fun. However the only problem with the game for me is that when i close the game and try to play it again steam says the game is already running. And the only way i can play the game again is to switch my laptop off and on again which is a real pain in the ♥♥♥! I would be extremely happy if the developer would fix this bug becase i love this game soooooo much! :D However the bug is really annoying.\n\nIn Luftrausers you can unlock differant parts for your rauser such as differant engines, guns and various other things such as better armour or a new part that makes your plane not get damaged by water or clashing with other enemies. You will unlock these parts as you complete levels. To complete levels you will have to complete tasks such as killing a certain number of enemies or killing one big powerful enemy that takes longer to kill. The basic enemies in the game consist of small fighter planes that dont get in the way to much but as you start to progress heavier more deadly fighters will attack you as well as naval ships and even a huge blimp!\n\nThere is a normal difficulty setting and an extra hard difficulty so there is plenty of challenges to complete.Luftrausers is a dogfighting/bullet hell game in which you will have to create tactics to dodge enemy bullets and shells. Another thing to mention is that by changing around your rauser parts the soundtrack also changes and throughout the game you will also be able to unlock various colour filters. I rate this game a 7.5 /10 (A very fun game with a good sountrack and replayability)\n\n(update as of 11/01/15) The bug i was having trouble with was fixed a month or so back.

This really is one hell of a game and I'd reccomend everyone and anyone give it a shot and to get up on those leaderboards. It handles very much like asteroids except with gravity, however asteroids handled terribly and this title manages to pull of the same concept but with complete finesse creating a hardcore and hard to master gameplay mechanic but with a simplistic 2 button control scheme (well one button and the arrow keys). There is really only one thing I could even come remotely close to criticism and that would be the story. Of course I can't hold this against luftrausers as it is a retro title meant for quick hardcore dosage and not meant to be taken too seriously in terms of setting. However this mini world in which it is set is fun, interesting and even the mini characters are so humorously designed that to see them come to life with some little bits of dialogue would make this a gem. Put that £59 in a bank and forget titanfall, get yourself a copy of this wonderful game filled with white knuckle, hardcore, skill based, retro, airborne, score chasing awesomness, not even mentioning the crazy boss enemies who patrol the skies littering the screen with lead.","March 19, 2014","true","6.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It might not appeal to people who are looking for a game with outstanding graphics and story, but that fact is obvious from the gecko. If you want a game like that, play all your fancy shamcy COD'S on ya ps4's.

The price tag is the biggest problem - how much do you value arcade games? I like this game enough I bought it twice (once on Steam, once on PS Vita), but I don't think everyone would. Look up "Luftrauser" (no S at the end) and play the original version. Watch some gameplay. If you like it, buy it. Maybe wait for a sale.\n\nIt's another cool and refreshing Vlambeer game.\nEdit: This game has, in my opinion, less replay value than Nuclear Throne. Maybe go for that instead. I have over 25 hours in it, and only about 12 collectively (both ports) on this game.","September 13, 2014","true","4.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It doesn't do a lot, but what it does, it does really well. The game plays kind of like Asteroids except there is constant gravity pulling you towards the water. The customizable Rauser is pretty cool. You pick a weapon system such as a machinegun, a continuous laser, spread shot that pushes you back, homing missiles, etc), a body (high health but low agility, you take no ramming damage but have little health, drops bombs but slow health regen, etc) and an engine (heavy thrust but poor turning while thrusting, near anti-gravity, no damage entering the water, etc) and then you just fight nonstop waves of enemies trying to rack up as many points as possible. Each combination has its own nickname and each part has little achievements tied to it too.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty frantic, as the sky quickly becomes filled with enemies and bullets. Thankfully you can take a decent amount of punishment before dying (unless you're using the melee part) and you regenerate health whenever you're not shooting.\n\nThe variety you can get while building your Rauser is impressive, a few of the builds I liked was a Rauser equipped with a heavy, slow firing cannon, the melee body, and the water engine. I'd just dive bomb ships and fire the cannon just before I rammed the ship and plunged into the water, even the battleships can't take too many hits from that. Of course, if I timed it wrong I'd fly right into their gunfire and be blown apart (melee body can take 2 maybe 3 hits from full before dying). Another cool Rauser I had success with was the Beam Laser, Bomb Body, and "Original" balanced engine. I'd just zip around dodging enemies and bullets and slice ships and planes to ribbons.\n\nYou don't have to grind too much for the parts either, I think I've basically unlocked almost all the parts (except one special one for each section I think, the padlock symbol looks different than the one for the rest I unlocked) in only about 2 hours of play I'd say. One additional neat thing is that the music changes depending on your parts selection. Its the same basic theme every time, but different parts use different "instruments". The music is pretty good too, IMO, though it might become repetitive quickly for some.\n\nOnly managed to reach (what I assume) is the "Boss" A massive war zeppelin once. The game is quite difficult. I could see this being an actual arcade game from 15-20 years ago easily, though given how difficult it is, it better have had extra lives per credit. Either way it would've munched my quarters ♥♥♥♥ing fast. This thing is fun.\n\nTL:DR Luftrausers Owns.

You take control of a single fighter jet, holding off thousand of planes, jets, boats, and submarines until you die. It's essentially achieving the highest score you possibly can. This game isn't easy, it's hard, but mastering is where the game shines.\n\nThis game is simple at it's core, but it's filled to the brim with fast paced, non-stop action, sure to get your adrenaline going. You don't fly this thing normally. You can turn it left, right, and accelerate by holding up. This means you can keep your fighter in the air for a good amount of time if you take advantage of the momentum. For enemies, you have your simple planes and boats, but stronger variants pop up, like battleships that have massive HP and fire a barrage of bullets, or aces in the sky with very accurate aim. You need to keep your wits about you, so dodge and shoot your way to victory. Shooting isn't the only way to kill enemies either, you can also ram into enemies for some massive damage, as the expense of losing health quickly. Your health is regenerative, so the way you recover it is to simply not fire your weapon.\n\nHowever, the best part about this game is the customization. There are literally 125 ways to build your fighter. You can change the weapon, body, and engine, each with their own perks and disadvantages. This makes the game accustomed to have so many different play styles, so you can see which one fits to your choosing. You can have a powerful tank with a cannon and heavy armor, have a super fast engine with a laser beam for quick aiming, or you can have a kamikaze style fighter with massive impact damage and explode spectacularly upon death.\n\nWith all these parts, also come missions for each individual part. This gives the player the chance to try out new pieces and accomplish a goal while doing so. Think of it as a reward for trying new things, and testing your skils. It extends replay ability as well.\n\nAfter you've messed around in normal mode long enough, there's another mode called SFMT, which is essentially hard mode. Battleships, Aces, and more enemies spawn right at the beginning, and it's as frantic as you can imagine, and you WILL die quickly. If you've mastered normal mode, try your skills at SFMT, and see how long you can survive Hell.\n\nOverall, Luftrausers is an incredible arcade style game with blood pumping action that never stops with so much customization in one package. This game is definitely worth full price, and you'll have an awesome time if you enjoy a good challenge.","December 22, 2014","true","5.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

You just keep going until the amount of guys on the screen is overwhleming and hope that when you die you've done some stuff you haven't before. That's it. That is literally the game.\n\nOverral I'd say 2/5, with the main appeal being the art-house WWI persepctive of a 2-d plane game. I got this for 6-7 $ and I'd say that along with Ultionus: A Poor Single Play DOS Game, it is one of the disappointments of the spring `14 indie releases and I wouldnt buy unless it's < 2$.","June 27, 2014","false","4.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

Difficult to master. Extremely difficult to complete.\n\nLuftrausers is a retro-styled arcade shooter that controls well and keeps the upgrades unlocking at a nice pace. These upgrades are a good selection of weapons, flight styles and armour/mods. It's enjoyable trying them all out too see how they work and how they can adapt your play style and each of the 125 combinations has it's own unique aircraft name ... a really nice touch.\n\nYour enemies range from enemy aircraft with different weapons (I hate the enemy aces armed with lasers, you will too), ships, submarines and the main objective to completing the game ... the "Blimp".\n\nAs I said before, the game is challenging and very difficult to complete, but it never seems to approach a rage inducing, keyboard smashing, joypad chucking level of difficulty. I think this is because of the game's "One level only, quick, short games" design.\n\nI liked it immensely. If you're a fan of side scrolling shoot-em-ups, you probably will too.\n\n8/10\n\nMarked down from 9/10 for not having any multi-player capabilities.

Well, I'm happy to report It has it in spades my friends.\n\nLuftrausers is basically Asteroids with gravity and World War I planes instead of spaceships. And it really goes for the aesthetic, presenting the whole game in a red, white and yellow sepia filter to match the WWI look of the menus and the various aircraft and boats.\n\nYou have goals that will unlock new parts for your plane that not only change the look and capabilities of your own craft, but also give the music a specific spin depending on the part you attach. This actually adds a lot to the game's minimal but stellar sound track.\n\nThere is no better feeling than when you become the plane! What I mean by that, is the moment when you wrap you mind around the controls. Then, before you know it, you're weaving in and out of a few battleship's bullet spray, while pulling a 180 to boost THROUGH your pursuers. Okay, so maybe its more than Asteroids with gravity and WWI planes, and thats why I love it.\n\nRecommend it to a friend,\nTino","January 1, 2015","true","9.9"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","6","10","2","0"

The controls are simple, and you should feel immediately taken by the frantic gameplay. Each play will last between 10s and a few minutes, depending on how good you are at dodging the endless streams of enemies bullets. But of course, you will want more, and in a few seconds you will be up in the air again trying to beat your previous score.\n\nYou might think that this wouldn't be fun for hours if you're not into "getting the highscore" mentality. But Vlambeer (the studio who developped LUFTRAUSERS), manage to take that simple idea of an arcade dogfighting game, and add something more.\n\nYour plane has 3 parts (Gun, Body, Engine) which you will soon be able to modify. There are 5 different parts of each type, which allow for lots of variation. More importantly, most parts are "side-grades", which mean unlocked parts are not better, but different than the original parts. Each part requires you to adapt your gameplay, and will offer different strengths and weaknesses.\n\nTo encourage you to try all the parts, each part is linked to several "missions", which are challenges you can accomplish with that part. For example "Killing 5 different enemies types in a single game", "Getting 5000 points in a single game", "Kill 150 enemies accross all playthrough", etc... Theses are not mandatory, but will allow you to unlock other parts and a few other hidden stuff.\n\nWhile trying to perform theses challenges, you will get to understand the different parts better, and find that some suits you better than others. I've often dismissed a specific part as weak, until i tried to complete its missions and figured out how to best use it (which part should go with which, and how to adapt my gameplay to the new plane). My 3 best scores have been with 3 different planes.\n\nAlso it's very telling that in forum threads asking "what's the best plane for doing X ?" all theses answers will vary wildly. There is no "best" plane. It's all about personal tastes and how you use each plane. So congratulations to Vlambeer for managing to balance all theses parts together.\n\nAll of that means that, over the simple arcade gameplay, there is that metagame to try to finish all missions. It may or may not please everybody, but i know it keeps me playing way more than a basic "aim for the highscore" game would.\n\nIt's quite easy to unlock all parts, so no player should frustrated that they lack part, but for hardcore players, unlocking everything is gonna be a true challenge.

Fairly simple tunes yet oh so satisfying with each cockpit, body, and engine giving a new combination of music for over an amount of 125 different ship and song combinations. Like most other Vlambeer games I have played this is short but overall amazing and really fun and quirky.\n\nI highly recommend this game if you are a fan of bullet hell games or games that have awesome soundtracks.

Gameplay and Story get a rating scale from 1 to 10, and the AV stuff gets a rating from 1 to 5. My philosophy on this is that there are some instances in which a game may not necessarily have that much in the way of gameplay (take Amnesia for example), but the story/atmosphere/whatever it may be is reason enough to pick it up. Also, take the cumulative score with a grain of salt; it's just a numerical feeling about the game as a whole. That's part of why I do these subscores. Also, keep in mind that I'm not going off of school grade based rankings. A 5/10 denotes what I feel to be an average game. Likewise, 7/10 is a game that I think is pretty cool, and something that gets a 2/10 is near-abomination level. Pinning scores to an even further obfuscated rating scale is kinda senseless, but for the sake of my backloggery, I'll repeat again that 1.0-2.7 is a one-star game, 3.0-4.7 is a two-star game, 5.0-6.7, 7.0-8.7, and 9.0-10 are three, four, and five stars, respectively.\n\nGameplay: Vlambeer has always been good at creating really simple yet excellently controlling games, and Luftrausers is certainly no exception. Essentially, you have four buttons: acceleration, boost left and right, and fire. You do have a "health meter," which is represented by a white circle closing in on you before you eventually die, which can be replenished by letting go of the fire button and not getting hit for a little bit. Speaking of death, this game is pretty tough. It certainly has that arcade style quarter munching level of difficulty. However, death is only a minor setback, as it only takes two to three seconds to get back into the action after dying. An average run won't last you much longer than two or three minutes, though.\n\nAnother aspect of this game is the customizable ship parts. You can get up to six guns, engines, and bodies, each with their own respective weaknesses and strengths. It is these parts, as well as the challenges associated with each and every part, that make Luftrausers much more than the simple arcade shooter I thought it was when I first saw it. There is actually a remarkable amount of depth for such a seemingly simple shooter (yes, that alliteration was intentional). My biggest complaint about the game - and it may seem minor, but it caused God knows how many deaths - is that every time you get hit, there is a frame or two of pausing. It stacks up whenever you're trying to manoeuvre your way through a hail of bullets. This is probably an intentional programming thing, as a ninety-some-megabyte game should not lag an i5-3470.\n\nOther than that, I really don't have any big time complaints. Also, SFMT mode made me cry in the corner out of sheer terror. I haven't completed all of the missions yet, and I still haven't unlocked the [Classified] as of the time of writing this, but I've gotten far enough into the game that I feel that I am able to give it fair enough of a review. For only one "big small" quibble, I give the gameplay in this game a 9/10.\n\nStory: This is one of the times where I don't bother to review the game on story, since there really isn't any. Instead, I'll just skip on to the graphics and not factor in a score for story into the final score.\n\nGraphics: One of the great things about applying a minimalist aesthetic is that it allows the artist to apply all sorts of subtle touches, and that's what makes this game great: it's filled to the brim with subtle touches that make it just great. For instance, when you're coming in over the water, how hard you're coming in affects the wake.Another subtle touch is the flames that come off of the aces whenever they are at low health. Overall, the pixel art in this game is just fantastic, and is definitely a good example of how to do considerable things with a minimal color pallete. For graphics, I'll give it a 5/5, 'cuz it just looks great.\n\nMusic: At its most basic level, there's only two songs in the game (the menu song and the combat song). However, in reality, there's about 126 songs in the game. How I can come up with that number is that there are 125 different ship combinations. Each part adds a different element to the base song. It's not a subtle thing, either; you can tell whenever a part you've put on changes the song, and all of them add pretty cool touches to the song. If you're switching parts every now and then, you most certainly won't get tired of the soundtrack. I know I didn't, and that's why I'm giving it a 5/5 for the incredibly dynamic soundtrack.\n\nOverall rating: 9/5/5; 9.5/10. I can see why this game took so long to develop: there's a remarkable amount of polish to this game. Also, if you think $10 is too much, don't. The game really is worth the money (even more so on sale). It's very playable  and has that "I need to kill ten minutes so here's a game" appeal.","April 17, 2014","true","7.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I recall reading an article from the guy who designed it (I think on kotaku.com) where he said they made it when they were at a dark place in their lives... and well, World War style games are like that, and even if they may regret being at a dark place, the game itself is worth playing and supporting. I want to see more from this studio when they are at a bright and happy place.\n\nI may not have played this game as long as I've played others, but I believe this is one of the greatest casual games I've played on steam. And when I say "casual" what I mean is a "pick up and play" game - you don't have to spend hours min/maxing your characters, grinding reputations... you just go out there and Rouse.\n\nWhen you unlock different parts for your Rouser each part has it's own challenges - and when you complete them you get harder and harder ones, so if eventually you get to one you're not doing great on, just switch to another part that may have easier challenges, do those, get better at the game, then go back and do the harder ones you were stuck on before.\n\nThe gameplay feels responsive, and "Rousing" as it's called where you essentially turn off the engine and free fall feels great; dodging cannonfire and enemy missiles only to re-ignite the engines seconds later to gain a burst of speed. It feels great.\n\nThe soundtrack is ace too; I can't think of any recent game that's made me think "This music is kicking!" but this does. I'd liken it to the "Jets'n'Guns Soundtrack" by Machinae Supremacy... however please note, the soundtrack to Jets'n'Guns is great... the game... utter poo-poo. It's available on steam, but I'd say listen to the soundtrack on Spotify and ignore the game.\n\nWell enough of me rambling. Buy Luftrrausers. Rause those Lufts!","April 21, 2014","true","3.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Fun flying and shooting mechanics, different combinations of weapons and ship part unlocks. Challenging game. Decent variety of enemies but expect to be getting very familiar with most. Quite hard gameplay but very addicting. Despite very simple controls the learning curve goes up steep for the first hour then flattens a little for a decent time as you get slightly better, completing challenges and unlocking parts (and colour schemes)...and then it explodes up again. Don't even bother with SFMT unless you are ninja at bullet hell. I really love the main game though, only game on my work computer, not that I get a chance to play it.

This slick 8-bit style shooter can keep you entertained for a long time, whether you're trying to unlock every part and achievement or trying to up your highscore just that little bit more. The controls are smooth and precise and the stalling and gravity mechanic adds a new level of depth and control over your aircraft over other similar games. Plane customization, finding that perfect combo of weapon, body, and engine for your play style also adds to the depth and replayability. And the music! Different combinations of parts also change up the soundtrack, all variations on a common theme. Many a times I had to fight the urge to break into goosesteping while rocking out to its tunes.

Both visually and musically the tone is set quite richly and its hard not to enjoy all the subtle little touches like the main theme song as you play changing based on how you configured your fighter.\n\nIts not necessarily spilling over with replayability.  The overall game is a bit fun but progress is rather limited in the 'finish one of these several goals' task completion.  Once you have finished all of the base tasks, there is another layer of incredibly ridiculously hard that opens up but its honestly *so* over the top its more worth trying for a few laughs at its utter futility.\n\nThe one last comment is that honestly I was not a fan of the controls *at all*.  While the basic flight mechanic is quite well executed, the game screams out for really solid gamepad support, and it was just not quite there.  While basic gamepad control is possible, its not very customizable and the configurations that you are presented with simply didn't work that well for me.  I ended up setting the gamepad down and just using the keyboard because in the end it was easier to manage.","June 7, 2014","true","6.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'm still sitting here trying this actually, with the game cut to .3 of its' original speed.\nThe whole system is based off getting a combo killing enemies, yet the flawed spawning rates sometimes leave me with only one enemy on screen which I can barely kill after around 12 or so normal enemies, which absolutely disappear.\nThere's also some flaws in the whole 'bullet hell with tank-controls' when some enemies can create whole walls which you just have to hope you pass through. These will also take up all of this 'spawn cap' so it's a huge block for no progress.\n\nAaand while I did enjoy the game, it's rather simplistic and the customizeable mechanics aren't very well balanced.

Both visually and musically the tone is set quite richly and its hard not to enjoy all the subtle little touches like the main theme song as you play changing based on how you configured your fighter.\n\nIts not necessarily spilling over with replayability.  The overall game is a bit fun but progress is rather limited in the 'finish one of these several goals' task completion.  Once you have finished all of the base tasks, there is another layer of incredibly ridiculously hard that opens up but its honestly *so* over the top its more worth trying for a few laughs at its utter futility.\n\nThe one last comment is that honestly I was not a fan of the controls *at all*.  While the basic flight mechanic is quite well executed, the game screams out for really solid gamepad support, and it was just not quite there.  While basic gamepad control is possible, its not very customizable and the configurations that you are presented with simply didn't work that well for me.  I ended up setting the gamepad down and just using the keyboard because in the end it was easier to manage.","June 7, 2014","true","6.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a simple game with good controls, and I find being able to move well in a 2d game like this just addictive, so I've spent my money's worth of time on this. The game starts off rather challenging already, and I found that getting around required actual thought, and made me develop a lot of tactics for different planes, which feels pretty rewarding.\n\nThen, for another eight hours, I tried going through the rest of the 'late game' achievements and some of its little flaws start to really shine. I'm still sitting here trying this actually, with the game cut to .3 of its' original speed.\nThe whole system is based off getting a combo killing enemies, yet the flawed spawning rates sometimes leave me with only one enemy on screen which I can barely kill after around 12 or so normal enemies, which absolutely disappear.\nThere's also some flaws in the whole 'bullet hell with tank-controls' when some enemies can create whole walls which you just have to hope you pass through. These will also take up all of this 'spawn cap' so it's a huge block for no progress.\n\nAaand while I did enjoy the game, it's rather simplistic and the customizeable mechanics aren't very well balanced. I'm a bit sore about the whole thing right now, but I don't think I can recommend this at ten dollars, at least.","March 22, 2014","true","32.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Not sure, although I already also played quite a bit of the free html5 or whatever version (it's very limited, only the standard plane and very few enemies). I've already unlocked all the different parts now, within 2 hrs. Although I haven't done all the challenges per plane part variant.\n\nThe planes are made up of three different sections, and for all the sections you can choose from 4-5 different parts which you unlock as you go. Unlocking is inevitable as it's tied to an unseen score total. Even if you only get a couple of thousand points per life it tallies your all time point total and levels you up at different numbers not too far apart.\n\nAll the different plane parts have challenges tied to them, I am not sure how deep these challenges go, but there must at least be 5 challenges per part? Since the plane consists of three parts you have three different challenges active at all times. The challenges is stuff like take out x amount of total enemies or one specific enemy, or do this many points. These can be both single life based or totaled up like the levelling, it says in the text what exactly it will count. Some are very easy and inevitable, especially if you don't have to do a specific thing inside a single life. But some, like taking out multiple battleships on a single round can be pretty tough. But then there's the NUKE body part for that one. Hehe.\n\nBut anyway, still super fun for now.","March 20, 2014","true","2.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Worth every cent.\n\nIn LUFTRAUSERS, skill matters just as much as style. You are rewarded for playing well to the aircraft's strengths with large combos and/or survivability, but the game is not reluctant in the least to punish careless mistakes and exploit the plane's weaknesses from both above and below. The player is given plentiful options to craft their most favorable flight/combat experience, yet they must always be prepared to suffer the cons of their choices; frankly, the balances between Pro and Con in this game are commendable and always clearly stated.\n\nThe combat itself starts out quite simple with a few basic enemies to work with that are vulnerable to virtually any style. This acts as a sort of grace period for pilots testing new combinations. However, the game quickly works itself into a pilot's nightmare full of stray bullets, introducing new enemies in both sea and air. This steep difficulty curve, in combination with the mission system and various 'bosses', contributes greatly to the addictiveness of the game. New high scores give you a genuine sense of accomplishment and encourage the pilot to pursue other combinations that may help them reach even higher. All in all, LUFTRAUSERS is one tough survival test that will keep you coming back for more.","March 26, 2014","true","9.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's simple enough to grasp with minimal controls and easy to latch onto goal; if it moves, blow it up. It's a shooter, it's an action game, it's fun, and it'll have you hooked. If this doesn't make you want to be a Rauser pilot, I don't know what will.\n\nDon't be fooled by the screenshots, this game is HARD. It appears easy, but it gets difficult fast. But unlike other games where ramped difficulty makes people want to give up after the first few tries, Luftrausers brings you back for more and more, giving you more options, more choices, more ways to kick some butt and blow stuff up. If you like a challenge, this game is definitely for you. You will spend hours with this.\n\nWhat makes this game so delightfully addictive is it's simple elegance. It doesn't need to be decked out and fancy to be a really fun and difficult game. It's satisfying to achieve goals and relaxing if you want to kick back and blow off steam. The action is non-stop, the music is great, and the graphics are an awesome throw back to the days of Space Invaders. You become a part of this incredible world full of bullets and fire, and you will love every second of it.

Gameplay and Story get a rating scale from 1 to 10, and the AV stuff gets a rating from 1 to 5. My philosophy on this is that there are some instances in which a game may not necessarily have that much in the way of gameplay (take Amnesia for example), but the story/atmosphere/whatever it may be is reason enough to pick it up. Also, take the cumulative score with a grain of salt; it's just a numerical feeling about the game as a whole. That's part of why I do these subscores. Also, keep in mind that I'm not going off of school grade based rankings. A 5/10 denotes what I feel to be an average game. Likewise, 7/10 is a game that I think is pretty cool, and something that gets a 2/10 is near-abomination level. Pinning scores to an even further obfuscated rating scale is kinda senseless, but for the sake of my backloggery, I'll repeat again that 1.0-2.7 is a one-star game, 3.0-4.7 is a two-star game, 5.0-6.7, 7.0-8.7, and 9.0-10 are three, four, and five stars, respectively.\n\nGameplay: Vlambeer has always been good at creating really simple yet excellently controlling games, and Luftrausers is certainly no exception. Essentially, you have four buttons: acceleration, boost left and right, and fire. You do have a "health meter," which is represented by a white circle closing in on you before you eventually die, which can be replenished by letting go of the fire button and not getting hit for a little bit. Speaking of death, this game is pretty tough. It certainly has that arcade style quarter munching level of difficulty. However, death is only a minor setback, as it only takes two to three seconds to get back into the action after dying. An average run won't last you much longer than two or three minutes, though.\n\nAnother aspect of this game is the customizable ship parts. You can get up to six guns, engines, and bodies, each with their own respective weaknesses and strengths. It is these parts, as well as the challenges associated with each and every part, that make Luftrausers much more than the simple arcade shooter I thought it was when I first saw it. There is actually a remarkable amount of depth for such a seemingly simple shooter (yes, that alliteration was intentional). My biggest complaint about the game - and it may seem minor, but it caused God knows how many deaths - is that every time you get hit, there is a frame or two of pausing. It stacks up whenever you're trying to manoeuvre your way through a hail of bullets. This is probably an intentional programming thing, as a ninety-some-megabyte game should not lag an i5-3470.\n\nOther than that, I really don't have any big time complaints. Also, SFMT mode made me cry in the corner out of sheer terror. I haven't completed all of the missions yet, and I still haven't unlocked the [Classified] as of the time of writing this, but I've gotten far enough into the game that I feel that I am able to give it fair enough of a review. For only one "big small" quibble, I give the gameplay in this game a 9/10.\n\nStory: This is one of the times where I don't bother to review the game on story, since there really isn't any. Instead, I'll just skip on to the graphics and not factor in a score for story into the final score.\n\nGraphics: One of the great things about applying a minimalist aesthetic is that it allows the artist to apply all sorts of subtle touches, and that's what makes this game great: it's filled to the brim with subtle touches that make it just great. For instance, when you're coming in over the water, how hard you're coming in affects the wake.Another subtle touch is the flames that come off of the aces whenever they are at low health. Overall, the pixel art in this game is just fantastic, and is definitely a good example of how to do considerable things with a minimal color pallete. For graphics, I'll give it a 5/5, 'cuz it just looks great.\n\nMusic: At its most basic level, there's only two songs in the game (the menu song and the combat song). However, in reality, there's about 126 songs in the game. How I can come up with that number is that there are 125 different ship combinations. Each part adds a different element to the base song. It's not a subtle thing, either; you can tell whenever a part you've put on changes the song, and all of them add pretty cool touches to the song. If you're switching parts every now and then, you most certainly won't get tired of the soundtrack. I know I didn't, and that's why I'm giving it a 5/5 for the incredibly dynamic soundtrack.\n\nOverall rating: 9/5/5; 9.5/10. I can see why this game took so long to develop: there's a remarkable amount of polish to this game. Also, if you think $10 is too much, don't. The game really is worth the money (even more so on sale). It's very playable  and has that "I need to kill ten minutes so here's a game" appeal.","April 17, 2014","true","7.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And wrong. True, you shoot and you fly; that's really it. The beauty of it however is how well realized Luftrausers' combat is, and it is marvelous. Weaving inbetween hails of bullets from all directions is an incredible experience, and after a while you start to get a handle on how to fly around and shoot at your foes. If that wasn't enough, the upgrade system is also well executed; with each unlockable feeling quite distinct from the next. Vlambeer really busted their creative noggins here (as they often tend to do).\n\nThe visuals are muted; true some might decry this as being a boring visual style, and while not popping with color it does lend a good deal of uniqueness to this title. Further, the art of your rather villainous looking comrades is quite striking as well, and fits the theme nicely.\n\nIf there was any con I'd have to conjure it'd be this; the nuke body is quite overpowered. I earned a couple achievements purely due to it's sheer power, and thus somewhat robbed me of more fitting gratification; though at the same time I'm not much of one to stress achievements in the 1st place, so being gifted one is certainly not the worst thing either. Plus, going too far towards balancing EVERYTHING can also make some improvements that much less apparent; so perhaps the diversity and power range is more a good thing than a bad one.\n\nI won't lie; I picked this game up in a bundle for $10. Am I satisfied? Quite a good deal actually; being the cheap purveyor of games I am I would have even considered picking this up in a sale for maybe %40-50 off. Very few cons to mention overall, with quite a good deal of pros to dote upon. A definite pick up on sale.","September 10, 2014","true","14.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You get significantly more turn control when your engine is stalled, allowing precision aiming and redirecting your movement in ways that defy realistic physics in favor of exciting gameplay.\n+The health system is interwoven into the weapons system. Pausing your onslaught lets you recover your health pool. The game plays alerts and puts an iris-in on the player when health is at dangerous levels.\n+Working together, there's an interesting and frantic dynamic of healing, attacking, moving, and steering that I've not seen any other game pull off.\n+Your planes, the 'Rausers', are customizable with the parts available. Mix and match for 126 different combinations that suit your style. Each of them even has their own name.\n+Soundtrack is dynamic. Each different Rauser part introduces a different melody, percussion, or bass-line to the song that is constructed for your session.\n+Camera is pretty solid at keeping itself oriented around what the player wants to be looking at based on where their Rauser is pointed and their current velocity.\n*Artstyle is minimalist, but minimalist is perfect for this type of game as it keeps visual noise on the down low so it can bombard your eyeballs with waves of bullets and enemy planes.\n-Scoring and combo system is heavily conflicting with the random enemy spawns. High-scores are incredibly dependent on a particularly rare enemy unit to spawn and then subsequently dispatched with a x20 multiplier.\n\nOverall, it's an incredibly well-tuned and fast-paced experience that is immensely satisfying to pick up and play for a few rounds, just don't go in expecting to be plugging hours away doing score attack as the numbers are ultimately meaningless beyond a certain point.","December 22, 2015","true","40.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cannonesshannah/recommended/233150/","cannonesshannah","Katie's Hannah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cannonesshannah/","979 products in account","Recommended: If you at all liked classic arcade side-scrolling shooters of old, LUFTRAUSERS is right up your alley.  It's a well-made side-scroller with high production values and excellent execution.\n\nLUFTRAUSERS is a classic side-scrolling arcade shooter made by Vlambeer and published by Devolver Digital.  Vlambeer is a game development house that has a certain knack for having their game ideas ripped off by mobile developers, and there's very much a reason for that: they make simple, arcade retro games very, very well, with an imitable art style and direction.\n\nAt it's heart, LUFTRAUSERS is a side-scrolling shooter set in a sort of alternate reality at the birth of jet flight, full of all kinds of anachronistic references to old science fiction and a rich graphics style that fully realises and embellishes the genre.  The art style in general is very well-implemented, as is the sound design.  It all fits together very well.  The music design deserves special mention, because the in-game music changes slightly depending upon your choice of hull, weapon, and engine.  So very different choices of plane will result in very different in-game music and it is a way of adding variety to the game that hasn't been much used before.\n\nThe game mechanics are simple, but work very well.  The divergence from simple normal side-scrolling is the inclusion of a stall mechanic - when you are engaging the engine boost, you simply glide, which allows greater precision in turns at the price of losing altitude and slower forward momentum.  It allows for a high skill ceiling in the maneuvering and some truly amazing stunts.  Coupled with a variety of weapons, hulls, and engines that all act differently, the game not only offers a variety that keeps the game fresh, but also allows a player plenty of latitude to find a combination that fits their play-style.  The controls are responsive, and it plays just fine with a keyboard, though this is another game that definitely feels more authentic with a classic controller.\n\nThe enemies in the game are varied and become incrementally more difficult as you survive longer.  It starts as simple fighter planes, but progresses to patrol boats, jet fighters, ace pilots, battleships, and more.  On top of that, unlock enough and you can unlock a "SFMT Mode" that not only greatly increases the speed at which the enemy progression occurs, but also unlocks new enemies to fight, as well as affords new unlocks for yourself.\n\nAll in all while the game mechanics themselves are fairly simplistic, there is plenty of variety to keep you engaged and the production values for this kind of game are as high as one might have come to expect from Vlambeer.  if you like side-scrolling shooters, then I think you'll find a lot to love in LUFTRAUSERS.\n\nPublished: http://highlandarrow.com/index.php/reviews/86-review-luftrausers","April 21, 2014","true","18.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I kept dying and had no idea WTF I was doing. Eventually I got the gist of the controls and experimented. After that I was hooked.\n\nWith only 4 keys (Left, Right, Boost and Fire) you'd think it'd be easy. Just pop in, hold Up/Boost, fly around and shoot things... and you'd be wrong. The controls may seem simple, but it's one of those games where that simplicity leads to a whole load of complexity when it comes to mastering this game. You have to get used to the idea of letting your plane freefall now and again, boosting at the right time and dodging bullets. Get enough enemies on screen (and off) and the game begins to remind me of Japanese Bullet Hell shooters, there is that much going on, and it's trying to kill you.\n\nAs you gain higher and higher scores and complete challenges, you level up, unlocking new parts for you plane, letting you customize it (doing so even changes the planes name). And each part has a series of challenges attached to it, so what challenges you have change depending on which parts your using.\n\nSeriously, for $10 this is a ♥♥♥♥ing amazing game and one well worth looking into even if you don't like air combat games, because this is very, very far from what you'd get in something like Jane's.","September 27, 2014","true","7.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

These affect things like attack type, health, abilities (such as ramming or going underwater). Each part also has several challenges, which are used to unlock new parts and secrets in the game (such as colour palettes). There are a wide range of enemies, ranging from small fighter planes, to massive blimps which rain bullet from the sky (while battleships and submarines do the same from the sea). The action is fast paced and there is little time between death and starting a new run, keeping the flow of the game.\n\nLUFTRAUSERS is a fun, addicting shoot em up, which adds a new take on the genre, whilst keeping with a lot of the conventions. The visuals are interesting and unique, and the music does make you feel quite awesome, especially as it changes based on the parts you are currently using. Overall, a great game for when you feel like blowing stuff up in style.","September 22, 2014","true","4.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

While the controls may seem unusual at first, you pick up on them right away. The art style is pleasent and goes very well with the overall theme. The color palette used for this game is easy on the eyes and will keep you sucked in for a while. The only minor downside is the usic. The music might seem enjoyble at first but it can get tiresome if you play for too long. Reason why i say that is minor is because the explosion sounds pretty much muffles out the music after you get deep in the levels.

LUFTRAUSERS is the most basic of arcade shmups in that you play until you die and hope to get a high score. However, it has more depth then most games of that type thanks to a range of interchangable parts that greatly effect your Rauser's performance in combat. You may choose from weapons, fusilages and engines, each with very different behaviors. Each of the many, many combinations has its own name and there is an achivement for trying them all once, by far the most time-consuming one. You can also change the game's color palette away from its default, deliberaitely monochromatic sepia tones, though most of these alternate schemes will wear on your eyes. The music also changes to match each configuration of your Rauser, and the game comes with the seperate audio tracks to create your own remixes. While thin for its list price of $10, the game is well designed, with responsive controls that challenge you rather then hamstring you, and an overall stylish presentation. Well worth getting on sale.","June 11, 2015","true","0.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

That is not a bad thing in this instance because Luftrausers  is a great arcade experience that relies heavily on gameplay and control. Not much of a campaign or story to speak of, but the dogfighting feels sublime. Turning your customizeable aircraft in mid air after cutting the thrusters gives you a cool sense of gravity that reminds me of an old school game but with modern tight control. The devs haven't crammed a jillion gameplay elements into this hoping to add "variety" either. The core gameplay stands on it's own and let's you get right into the fray without a lot of BS. And when you die, and you will, you'll be right back out there fighting it out within seconds if you wish. This is what I want from indie games. A game that doesn't try to pad out the experience to feel like a big title, instead Luftrausers does one thing uniquely and extremely well and with a lot of style.","June 22, 2015","true","1.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Luftrausers is a pretty straight forward arcade style bullet hell game that is well designed and fun to play. It offers ways to customize your "rausers" with different bodies, weapons, and engines. I do like that each combination has its own name, it's not a big deal, but it's a small thing that I rather like. According to the trailer each rauser has its own music and while I did notice a slight, it's not so unique that I instantly noticed.\n\nLuftrausers takes up very little space on my hard drive, it isn't taxing on my processor, it's cheap, and you can jump into a game in seconds. It's a game I play when I have a few minutes to kill like BroForce or Papers Please, but I think BroForce has more content. Still, Luftrausers is a lot of fun and I strongly recommend like pretty much the majority of people who play it.","June 22, 2015","true","2.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

(It even features some recycled Hotline Miami musik, so you know that part is wonderful.)\n\nA triumph for pixel art in games.\n\nWorks off the principle that what goes up must come down (YES!--gravity), using this physic to create a whole new twist to twin-stick shooter arcade play.  Also, playing like a suicide-bomber can be to your advantage as you can use your plane to melee enemies as well as to fire missles.  Very challenging gameplay (the achievements will most likely not be hard to cook through, but the game itself provides a beautiful challenge and you can compete for high scores).\n\nThe art is simplistic, but subdued, easy on the eyes, and beautiful.  The art style is unique and fun, the kind of art you would expect from Devolver.  Beige color-scheme is interesting.  Play-style is customizable (you can alter weapons/parts of the ship).\n\nThe gravity mechanic doesn't make sense in light of the German war Aero-plane theme, but oh well.  It's a video game  and absurdity is welcome.  The sky and water serve as a function of the game, not just backdrop, so I guess it all works.\n\nI came to love this game in a very short time and this is definitely doing to be one of my top picks for a long while.","November 9, 2015","true","5.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

It takes place somewhere between the Second World War and the Cold War, or in an alternative reality in the ten to fifteen years after the Second World War. We’re talking the age of fear for mind control, floating sky fortresses, orbital rays, weaponised dolphins, cryptography and submerging warplanes. The player is part of an undefined enemy force that was not on ‘our’ side during the six or seven decades in which military intelligence was effectively telling us to prepare for a laser-equipped hoverboat assault. It's pretty awesome.\n\nAs a Vlambeer game, LUFTRAUSERS has a lot going for it. The game is all about big bullets, lots of screen-shaking explosions, fun mechanics, and ridiculous controls. Like with all Vlambeer games, it features a high skill ceiling and difficulty while maintaining easy accessibility and addictive gameplay. Aesthetically, it has simple but great pixel art and vibrant color palettes. KOZILEK's soundtrack is amazing; it subtly changes as you customize your Rauser with different guns, hulls, and engines. Everything about it just feels amazing.\n\nThere are a few flaws, however. The user interface is a little clunky; I've had trouble remapping the controls and the menus are a little hard to navigate. Players might get turned off by the simplicity and lack of content as well as the difficult missions. Still, I definitely think it's worth the $10. It's one of the best air-combat/dogfighting games I've ever played.\n\nTL; DR: for fans of fun games.","October 6, 2015","true","9.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This game does not allow you to change the volume settings or any options until after you beat the tutorial stage. This is important enough to be the first line of this review because if you're like me and like to chat with friends over voicechat, you may need your master volume turned up pretty high and adjust games as needed. I almost didn't even play this game because of how loud it was on startup and there was nothing I could do in-game to fix it. Eventually after some googling I took some time away from friends to mute everything so I could pass the tutorial and actual fix the in game volume.\n\nNow, after that this is an extremely fun game. The arcade action is quick and fun and there's a ton of different configurations of parts to make your Rauser out of. Well, if a ton is equal to One Hundred and Twenty Five. Still, there's a lot of variety and each part has it's own mission objectives, giving some direction other than just scoring and adding to longevity to the experience. The four color aesthetic works wonderfully and the music plays to the action very well. Besides the red and sepia look there are other color schemes to unlock, most of which I've found are completely terrible, but they are completely optional and don't take away from the core experience which is so fun that the only real complaint I have with it is that I wish there was more!","June 20, 2015","true","4.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The soundtrack is award worthy and the game is presented really well visually. I can't say comfortably that the simplistic left-right-stop-go flight play is as sensational as the feeling provided by flying a little too close to sea level, but the controls are responsive and the physics just berserk enough to provide fast game play that doesn't feel as acid-trippy as something like Geometry Wars. This is quite bullet hellish, but difficulty comes from maneuvering an airplane with two speeds (on and off) rather than raw, unfair amounts of projectiles.\n\nAll in all it is a very charismatic arcade game with a scare amount of content but a **** ton of flavor.

LUFTRAUSERS is the most basic of arcade shmups in that you play until you die and hope to get a high score. However, it has more depth then most games of that type thanks to a range of interchangable parts that greatly effect your Rauser's performance in combat. You may choose from weapons, fusilages and engines, each with very different behaviors. Each of the many, many combinations has its own name and there is an achivement for trying them all once, by far the most time-consuming one. You can also change the game's color palette away from its default, deliberaitely monochromatic sepia tones, though most of these alternate schemes will wear on your eyes. The music also changes to match each configuration of your Rauser, and the game comes with the seperate audio tracks to create your own remixes. While thin for its list price of $10, the game is well designed, with responsive controls that challenge you rather then hamstring you, and an overall stylish presentation.

That is not a bad thing in this instance because Luftrausers  is a great arcade experience that relies heavily on gameplay and control. Not much of a campaign or story to speak of, but the dogfighting feels sublime. Turning your customizeable aircraft in mid air after cutting the thrusters gives you a cool sense of gravity that reminds me of an old school game but with modern tight control. The devs haven't crammed a jillion gameplay elements into this hoping to add "variety" either. The core gameplay stands on it's own and let's you get right into the fray without a lot of BS. And when you die, and you will, you'll be right back out there fighting it out within seconds if you wish. This is what I want from indie games. A game that doesn't try to pad out the experience to feel like a big title, instead Luftrausers does one thing uniquely and extremely well and with a lot of style.","June 22, 2015","true","1.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Luftrausers is a pretty straight forward arcade style bullet hell game that is well designed and fun to play. It offers ways to customize your "rausers" with different bodies, weapons, and engines. I do like that each combination has its own name, it's not a big deal, but it's a small thing that I rather like. According to the trailer each rauser has its own music and while I did notice a slight, it's not so unique that I instantly noticed.\n\nLuftrausers takes up very little space on my hard drive, it isn't taxing on my processor, it's cheap, and you can jump into a game in seconds. It's a game I play when I have a few minutes to kill like BroForce or Papers Please, but I think BroForce has more content. Still, Luftrausers is a lot of fun and I strongly recommend like pretty much the majority of people who play it.","June 22, 2015","true","2.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Sure, the floaty controls and 2D shooting is satisfying, for a few hours that is. There's only 15 parts to customize your aircraft with, 7 enemies to dogfight with, and 1 gamemode: shoot things to get points until you die. It's an endless wave game with some very frustrating elements to it such as the simple art style which is pretty, but can interfere when there's a bunch of similarly colored things on the screen and compounded by immense screen shaking when things explode and stuttering when you take damage. The "100 challenging missions" the game touts is nothing more than a list of basic and boring goals such as "Kill a Blimp" or "Get a score of 8000" that is effectively a list of achievements that quickly becomes a test of luck down the line with its pseudo-difficulty.\n\nThe bullet hell nature of the game is also hindered by the fact the camera is heavily focused on your rauser despite all the airspace available, you will often find yourself flying straight into a cloud of bullets that leaves you a very small window of opportunity to dodge whereas other bullet hell games gives you view of the entire field to plan out your maneuvers. All of this and the game asks you for $10, not really expensive, but for that price one could buy other replayable games with truckloads of more content such as Binding of Isaac, Dungeons of Dredmor, FTL, or Risk of Rain.

Fairly disappointing.\n\nAfter the first maybe 15-20 minutes you may encounter your first blimp, kind of a boss which was fantastic the first time but it turns out that's basically the most powerful thing, the only boss ever. A hardcore SFMT mode just adds more stuff and more bullets coming at you, no new interesting enemies.\n\nAlso no restart button I could find when I accidentally started a game in the wrong mode or wrong ship setup, you have to just kill yourself which is rather difficult to do in the normal game mode for 10-15 seconds while there are very few enemies (particularly with the underwater thruster).\n\n"Let's have a 5sec air raid siren start each hardcore game, where average playtime is about 5sec." That's where I had to mute my audio unfortunately where it was otherwise enjoyable in other parts of the game.\n\nAgain the first 30 minutes of playing and unlocking (~80% of the game) stuff is great fun, which is maybe why this game got so many great reviews from critics who didn't play further?

It's a physics-based game, kind of, except when it's not.\n\nMy biggest critique is that you don't make progress; you unlock a bunch of stuff that looks cool, but mainly isn't.\n\nStuff like "body that's a blade that makes you weaker than default but doesn't insta-kill hard baddies on impact hits so net the heavy armor does more DPS + survivability".  Basic stuff.  Stuff that should have been addressed, if not at release, but in a patch, after the developers had a chance to get away from their product for a while and then played it, rather than merely testing features.\n\nSo the game gets hard, basically Nintendo Hard, but you're stuck with the (few) combinations of parts that are actually worth using at all and a bunch of features, like dropping bombs, that feel like they should have been available to every body type, because it was one of the few interesting things.  And then you get to the end and are going to be like, "well, that was short".\n\nCompared to Wings Of Fury, this is a simplistic game that is pretending to be a lot more than it is.  I did not honestly feel like I got my $10 worth, and I rarely ever feel that.\n\nIt's like they made this at some Code Day in about 24 hours, then slapped a very basic UI and some hired-gun graphics on it and then called it Done, frankly, with no further follow-through to improve the core balance of the design, a very limited selection of enemy types, and game mechanics that basically just punish you for making progress, without mitigation.  There isn't a story; there's nothing to get emotionally involved in... it's less interesting in those respects than any smallish title I've played recently.\n\nThe game doesn't even have a difficulty setting, for example, so for a lot of you twitch-challenged people... you'll just hate it, frankly.\n\nThis is the kind of game where if you actually long for games that were just brutally hard to keep you from noticing how bad they really were in the 1980s, then you're probably moderately happy, but I don't actually like the results much; it's like they borrowed liberally from the past without understanding it very well and then were promoted by All The Right People so that suckers like me would shell out $10.  It's rare that I've encountered a well-mentioned Indie darling with less to really offer for the money, though.\n\nNever again, Vlambeer- either build decent games that deliver real value and patch after release to get balance and the core of gameplay halfway decent or fuggitaboutit.","May 7, 2015","false","1.5"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","1"

Yes? Good game, that. This is nothing like it.\nFor a start, you will usually have a better K/D, and generally, if you intentionally crash into an enemy then you will probably be flying a nuclear bomb. That way, it's more satisfying when you die. Basically, there are 15 different interchangable parts, in 3 categories, giving 126 (don't ask about the last one) possible planes. To unlock them is easy, you just need to play mediocre for a while. However, each part has several missions, such as kill a submarine on max combo (I'LL GET YOU ONE DAY YOU LITTLE ****ER), which, when completed, get you a little further towards unlocking Plane 126. Expect to be pummeled and to pummel in your quest for the illusive final Rauser, and never drop dat combo.","January 10","true","15.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Several enemies can take you out in a snap, sometimes when they're not even on screen. I've had several occasions where I've gotten out of an intense dogfight with only a scrap of health left (with little else on the screen) only for a jet to zoom in and smack into me. Battleships either need less health or shoot less bullets, and an ace can often times take you out before you have any time to react. For several hours, most of my objectives consisted of "take out a blimp to continue", but I can't for the life of me tell you the spawn conditions for one (sometimes they appeared 30 seconds in, sometimes three minutes of intense fighting will pass with niether hide nor hair). Blimps don't spawn nearly often enough to develop a strategy, and when I finally did beat one it was by dying with the kamikaze bomb part.\n\nDespite it's shortcomings, however, LUFTRAUSERS' ten dollar asking price seems about right as an asking price, and I'd definitely buy it again. I can see myself sinking plenty more hours into this game.\n\n","May 14, 2014","true","4.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Between the extremely low health and damage that any Rauser combo produces (in comparison to what you are up against) you still get overwhelmed easily.\n\nThe game goes from slow to bat-♥♥♥♥-crazy in a matter of 30-45 seconds. The combo counter resets far too quickly and is impossible to keep if the game decides to stop spawning the little weak planes. Battleships often spawn on top of eachother and create a hail of bullets that even the high armor body can't eat. The randomization makes it far too luck based.\n\nOverall, this game makes a real solid effort and I am sure many people are up to the challenge. This game is for them. I however will take a pass on the "drag-your ♥♥♥-across-razorblades" difficulty in hopes they tweak and balance the game a bit more. Maybe introduce a planes only or boats only mode, etc.","March 31, 2014","false","17.5"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

I really tried to like this game, but to me the controls are too "floaty" for a bullet hell. The physics just feel weird and you take damage randomly because the gravity sends you flying across the screen. I think LUFTRAUSERS is probably a good game, it's definitely well made. It looks good, it sounds good, it runs well, but it just isn't.. fun. I'm sure some people will like the controls but I personally prefer more tight controls, less "get thrown off into the distance" gravity, in a game that relies entirely on being precise. It would be so much more fun and a testament to actual skill by feeling like you're learning enemy patterns and dodging accordingly but instead I just feel like it's random whether a run goes well or not. I never felt like I was learning anything about the enemy patterns and I couldn't even focus on my objective because I was struggling just to feel in control of my plane. I get that it's an arcade-style game but lack of content and "loose" controls just make LUFTRAUSERS so hard to enjoy for me. Your mileage may vary and if you're looking for a neat score attack game and don't mind having imprecise controls, you'll probably like this game. Maybe I'm just bad at adjusting to the physics and trying too hard to play it like 95% of twin stick shooters/bullet hells, but controls like this just don't feel right in a game about precision and accuracy. It feels like I'm adjusting more to myself moving than what any of the enemies are doing. The menus are also really too simple for their own good. I wanted to look at controls to see if there was anything I should know because I skimmed past the tutorial. It then made me remap every single control and I tried pressing b to exit because I had no intention of changing controls, just viewing the defaults, and it changed my controls for good. I then had to delete the inputs config file to reset it, still confused as to whether there were deeper mechanics.\n\nIn conclusion, LUFTRAUSERS is not the twin stick bullethell shooter I wanted it to be but rather a weird, floaty physics shooter. If you can get used to the gravity of your plane, I'm sure you can have a good time with this, but I think some people will just find the control scheme too esoteric or obtuse.","November 6, 2015","false","1.0"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

This is the latter. Enemies will be shooting at you from so far off your screen you just have to hope and pray that you are zigging and zagging at the right time... And even then it won't matter, because an ace will fly up right behind you as you're trying to dodge the battleship shells and just put 4 in your tailpipe. I constantly found myself at the edge of the viewable playfield, which made it all the easier for a newly spawned enemy to just ram an extra bullet or six into my ship. If the game allowed you to lock the viewscreen center on your ship, the game might be a little more fun.\n\nThe game is difficult only because you are not given enough data to put up a fair fight. I don't appreciate it when they make the game difficult by severely handicapping the player, though it does explain why the game gives you massively overpowered weapons that you then have to fire blindly off the screen to hope you'll hit something.","July 23, 2014","false","4.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","3"

Maybe 20-40 minutes into the game I unlocked every single plane part (except for the top secret last ones), and thus I really had nothing else to play for. While there is that final unlock, it just becomes a technical challenge and a grind due to the lack of unlockables, which makes for painfully unfulfilling gameplay.\nOverall I would give this game a 4.5 out of 10, because it gets very old very quickly.","December 24, 2014","false","0.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The asteroids-style control scheme adds to the experience and the simple color palette lends a style that I find interesting.\n\nPlaying the game you will unlock new parts for your plane and new graphical color palettes that can be changed out. This adds some variety to the gameplay or allows you to somewhat tailor the game to your playstyle.\n\nThe only negative thing I have to say about the game would be that it seems to be capped at 30 FPS. It definitely doesn't feel like it is running at 60 FPS, which I think would be a much better experience for this type of game.

You can turn on/off the thrusters and rotate freely however you want, allowing for the many parts of your plane to show off how they work best. For example, if you have a spread gun, heavy frame, and a superbooster, you would lead a ton of enemies in one direction, then cut the thrusters and fire backwards. On the other hand, if you had the melee frame, laser weapon, and underwater booster, you would keep low, spear through ships, and take down planes with the laser. The possibilities in this game are endless and so is the fun! I would recommend this game to anyone, no matter who you are.","April 22, 2014","true","363.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Letting go of up stalls the engine, allowing you to begin drifting back to the water. Entering the clouds or the water causes you damage, to start with anyway. Stop firing, and any damage you took begins to regenerate. And that's the nice, simple start.\n\nBy the end... Well, you'll be flying around furiously, firing giant fireballs that explode on impact with an enemy, equipped with a submarine propeller so water no longer hurts you, with the fuselage of a nuke that explodes on your death. Oh, and there'll be a siren going off, and not long after it's likely you'll be dead.\n\nAnd eventually, after some seriously difficult challenges... you'll unlock the U-Rauser, and boy, you probably didn't see that coming.

By far. Because it has the worst controls I have ever seen in a game in my life. No matter what, it is impossible to get used to the controls. I can't fly at all because the controls are so nightmarish. I don't care what anyone says, the controls are the worst in the history of video games. It gives me almost no real control over my plane. All I could do was fight gravity to stay out of the water but I just kept dipping down into the water. I can really only kill planes by unavoidably slamming into them. You have to stop firing to repair your plane but you still can't because the screen is filled every milimeter with bullets and planes that are impossible to avoid because you have no proper control over your plane. How this game got past their quality control team blows my mind. Obviously they have no QA department. Hopefully this gets taken down from the steam store and at least there's Hotline Hiami, which is pretty much the only great game that Devolver has made.\n\n0/10 horrible","January 3, 2015","false","0.6"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

As a RAUSER pilot, it is your job to protect the Fatherland with glorious engineering bestowed by... blowing up ♥♥♥♥.\n\nLUFTRAUSERS has fun, addictive gameplay, and retraux graphics that somehow manage to be more detailed than a lot of other games relying on the same art style. Sparks fly from your plane, smoke billows from damaged enemies, and explosions shake the screen like you've had too much coffee. The overall feel of playing is seriously engaging, as every shot you take and every movement you make feels... just fantastic. For every major accomplishment (such as, say, blowing up your first battleship) you get a short little cutscene celebrating your accomplishment, making you feel genuinely proud of your amazing skill.\n\nUpgrades are unlocked fairly frequently, but the real challenge is unlocking the final three mystery parts. Trust me, that ♥♥♥♥ is worth it, and don't spoil it for yourself.\n\nFor those of you who truly find joy in pain, there's also an unlockable SFMT mode, in which the game takes it up to 11... and breaks the scale. Good luck surviving that.\n\nIn short, LUFTRAUSERS is a seriously engaging, pew-pew explosions, defend our engineering and take down hordes of enemies with this plane, simulator. Worth it at base price, must-buy on sale.","January 12, 2015","true","16.8"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","25","1","4","2","1"

I was expecting a story mode or something similar, but all I got was a straightforward 2D shoot-em-up. That having been said, I am not in the least disappointed by what I received; this game knows what it does and does it well. It provides the classic arcade experience of scoring as much as possible without dying, throwing in for bonus the rush of excitement when you stall in midair, watching hordes of enemies and waves of bullets streak past you in a whirlwind of death. The stalling mechanic is really what makes this game so good; you can stop accelerating and simply let gravity do the work of dodging hazards for you, then after changing direction speed up at the last second and escape the jaws of death. Obviously it's not a lot of content, despite the number of ship parts allowing for a commendable combination of ships and thus playstyles. For what I paid, however, I'd say I easily got my money's worth.","September 11, 2015","true","3.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/privatedoomsday/recommended/233150/","privatedoomsday","privatedoomsday","http://steamcommunity.com/id/privatedoomsday/","39 products in account",""LUFTRAUSERS" is kind of an interesting indie game; it takes place in an alternate history setting, where in World War II, Adolf Hitler never came into power. So, in this universe, the Germans were allies, and the Nazi party never existed.\nThe enemies in the game are the Japanese, the Russians, and the Italians. It's an interesting game where the main protagonist is a fictional World War II pilot.\nAnyways, the gameplay is quite interesting; with interestingly made 2-D graphics with a distinct "retro-like" feel to them, a high quality soundtrack, and interesting yet simple gameplay, this sure beats having to play the video game, "Gods & Generals". I highly reccomend this game, for anyone who likes alternate history-themed games. It's quite challenging, but it's supposed to be. I give it 4/5, saying that it's a simple, yet quite fun game, though $9.99 seems kinda pricy for this game, (I would reccommend getting this whenever it goes on sale) but if you're a die-hard fan of alternate history games or simply excellent indie games, GO FOR IT, because for a simple arcade-based space shooter, it's AWESOME!","November 12, 2014","true","0.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I can now recommend this game BUT only for the game play and the controls, which are so solid that when you die you know its your fault. I say "when" because this is a bullet hell side scrolling sh'mup and you are going to die. This one is a challenge, again, I'm at 40 hours and I'm still 3 missions away from 100% completion. *sigh*\n\nThere are still bits to this game that I find upsetting. Normally I would care less, but the game is soooo good that the little things to it are upsetting.\n\nCons\nBeing color blind, I found that I can only use 4 of the 15 color schemes. The other 11 color schemes, I'm lost. Majority are horrendous anyways.\n\nI still find the 4:3 game play a huge disapiontment. I would really love to know the reason Vlambeer decided to go with this format.\n\nStill get lost navigating the menu... Yeah after 40 hours of game play.\n\nCalibrations! The controls are just too damn sensative in the menu and seem to be inconsistent at times. Controls just stop working.\n\nAiming is still very difficult due to a number of factors. First, for weapons the have low frequence of shots, you have to guess when you are able to shoot again. Example missiles, you can only shoot 4 at a time. Sometimes they go rogue on you preventing you from firing. This is problem for health regen., keeping up your combo, defense, and offence. Second, the lower bit graphics also contribute.\n\nPros\nEverything else.\n\nFinal Thought\nTo put it simply, its a great game with the worst design.\n\n[Prior Review]\n+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\nThere is something I'd like to note before I review. I do play this game regularly in hopes that some of these issues are fixed. This review and rating may be updated.\n\nI love this game, which has some of the finest shmup action I've played. Beside the game play and the audio, for me, nothing else works. First off, I don't understand the decision the developer made with color scheme, more modes, more horrendous than the next can be unlocked to making it even more difficult than the last to identify enemies. A characteristic of this game that seems like a truely unnessisary hinderence. I'm really hoping there is a normal color scheme mode to unlock. Additionally, when you first load the game, you get the splash screen in wide screen, then in the game, standard. Black strips? What a tease, I can look past this small issue, only if it wasn't used a method to limit the firing range of the player and not the computer. Also with the graphics, I don't mind they are low res but it makes for difficult aiming without a line of sight or some other targeting method to see where you are shooting, this is critical when using weapons with a low frequency rate of fire.\n\nNext, navigating the menu's are a chore and shouldn't have to be. When you have 'go to' screens set to buttons that change on you pending the menu screen you are looking at can get confusing. The menu settings can be changed way too easily and inadvertantly as the controls are too sensative with no way to turn them down or even have dead zones. And how the heck do you exit the game? Well, took me a couple games to firgure out but you have to navigate to one screen to exit the game or even get to the options, that screen being what I thought was the start of the game.\n\nThere really isn't too much more to this game and these intended unnessisary problems really do break my heart as I'm seeing a great game go bad. but If you are the type of gamer that can look past these problems, I do recommend this, but otherwise as it stands today, I can not. Maximum I'd give this a 6/10. That 6 easily could be a 9 or 10. Will update if game does.\n-RoX","April 1, 2014","true","78.2"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

I will provide examples if pressured.\n\nIf you think the unique mechanics of this game itself make it worth purchasing, then the eb version is free and feels better to play, though it is still not very entertaining.\n\nThe special part of this version of the game is that completing a number of missions will unlock new ship parts and extras like cutscenes and background color swaps.\n\nThe ship parts are all given strengths and weknesses, but they are poorly balanced to be overpowered or useless.  I will provide examples if asked.\n\nThe missions themselves do not directly relate to being "good at the game", and one can quickly earn all ship parts and a randomizer but save for the last three without beating the game once (It took me around four hours).  The music is made up of a universal part and three parts that are assigned to each part of your ship-- in other words the music has a very large chance of being disjointed and offputting, not around long enough to stick in your head, and , worst of all, gimmicky.  If you play with the randoms on so that you have a chance to ue some of the useless parts instead of playing with the superior build.\n\nThe extra backgrounds are likely to be offputting save for one or two, based off of your color preferences, and even the faded black/white (beige) film aesthetic seems tired and uninspiring.  The main and common grunts are too easy to take care of, and only pose a threat when they are in groups of more than ten, and the large battleships are too powerful.  Once you learn how to fight the battleships, then you are able to survive until the enemy dogfighters arrive--- which are actually fun to fight instead of annoyances like the blades of grass that are the grunts or the trees that are the battleships.\n\nThough, to even have fun DOGFIGHTING IN A DOGFIGHTING SIMULATOR, you have to make it through the boring first section,which happens to be very long.  Then, while you are polishing your skills, the boss will show up, leaving no time to enjoy yourself.\n\n--To be continued--","November 25, 2015","false","7.9"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","2"

I have not played the Flash version of this game, but after playing, what is in my opinion, an overpriced flash game. Here are a few reasons why:\n\nControls:\nIt is easy to tell from a mile this game was made for a gamepad, as none of the menu screens have mouse control, and more often than not end up taking you where you did not want to go in the first place. An example would be trying to costimize the Rauser, getting to the Hanger is as easy as pressing right with the arrow keys or D-pad, but instinctively would immidiately start trying to optimize the desired prefrence for the craft. Instead have to confirm what you want to customize the plane, a simple rotation selection screen, then have to press X to set the plane as complete. Key-binding is awful, a set track of trying to understand what you want to bind to makes for a frustrating adventure, where a simple sheet simply saying what key is for what button would have made this game worlds better. On top of ths, it appears I cannot find the file that contains the text file to easily bind what I want to which key.\n\nIn game flying feels unnatural as well. Accurately aiming the Rauser in one direction is harder than it sounds and is pure frustration when this game could do with precise free aim instead of this "single stick control". More often than not I turn in to Kamikaze dolphine that wasn't build for the water. Being shot by things off screen does not help either....\n\nGraphics:\nSepia pixlated style. Again, something that the trailer covers, but, this makes certain  projectiles, such as the lazer, disappear behind clouds, and the beam is the exact same collor, shade and tone of certain things with the background. The amount of things on screen feels alittle empy. As I said, being shot off screen is a real pain, with no indicator of where the enemy is after the shots have travelled far off and more accurately that the hopeless Rauser that sprays blindly in to the distance hoping to get a kill, percpetively wishing that you had the same sight range as your enemy AI, BUT MOST CERTAINLY DON'T. This is what makes me feels extremely cheated when playing this game.\n\nSound:\nMusic? Exellent. A bit overpowering at max volume (ingame settings) but good. That is, one track slightly moddified with your craft's load out. Other game sounds? intentionally styleized with the look, but nothing outstanding. Could easily be replaced with someone making "pew pew" and weird lazer noiced with their mouth and it'd be the same.\n_____\n\nFor something that started simple, it sure as hell stayed that way to be pushed out with a price tag on it. There are many games that follow similar pixle art style and are easily better than this. This is a game that could have had LOADS of more content for what we pay for, but sadly not worth the 10 dollar tag this game asks for.\n\nCould easily be better.","April 1, 2014","false","4.1"," 7 of 18 people (39%) found this review helpful","39","7","18","0","0"

Made by Devolver Digital and Vlambeer, it has a delicious arcade feel to it, meaning it can be played for 5 mins or 5 hrs, depending on the mood you may be in. Multiple enemy types to destroy, many leaving the player with a great feeling of satisfaction (I'm looking at you, battleships and blimps).\n\nThere are lots of different parts available to the player for the customization of their rauser. There are also many unlockable color palettes to choose from, which allow you to change up the flavor of your rausing here and there. The difficulty is perfectly scaling, increasing a little more with each kill, each passing second of your continued survival. The one big drawback I've found with this game is no multiplayer option. Even a local VS mode would help add so much more variety to this already immensly addicting game.\n\nIf you like techo/electro music with a sort of diesel influence, you will love the soundtrack of Luftrausers. It has a great selection of tracks which perfectly match up to the setting of your aireal combat.

You customize your plane, take to the sky, and have some bullethell fun.\nWhen I say it's addicting though, I don't mean it in a good way. It's addicting like heroin or crack cocaine is addicting, at it's core the game is barely playable.\n\nThe game mechanics are fine, really, they are, you fly around in a way that no pilot should never ever have to fly (i.e. cutting the engine off to make a hard turn, spinning in circles just to engage at the last second before hitting the water), shoot at boats and planes, and later, shoot at dirigibles and submarines. Let me start with that first one: I saw one review of this game that described the game's controls as "flawless." This is in no way the case since it feels like someone took a bullet hell, stapled that vector graphic Tank battling game to it and called it a day. In no way should anyone have to control like this in a bullet hell.\n\nAs I mentioned before, you can customize your plane, and this is neat. But this is where the game falters THE MOST. Most of the unlockable parts you, well, unlock, are absolutely useless. You can unlock a melee fighter body which can ram into thinks without even getting a scratch, but when you realize that this is a bullet hell you should be uninstalling the game. You can also unlock a few other bodies, but all of them are ♥♥♥♥ing useless with the exception maybe one or two. All of the other bodies basically cripple your plane in the hopes that you'll find the tactic fun or interesting.\n\nThe weapons I don't really have a problem with. They all have their ups and downs with the exception of missile, which no sane human being would ever use, but for the most part they feel finished and polished. It's such a shame the dev didnt take the time to ♥♥♥♥ing do the same for the other parts you can apply to your plane.\n\nAnd then there's the amount of parts you can have. The game's store page boasts 125 combos to add to your plane, but when you factor in the undeniable truth that most of the bodies and engines are ♥♥♥♥ing useless, you're instead left with about 50 useful combinations. And, while 125 may seem like a lot of parts, YOU WILL UNLOCK THESE PARTS WITHIN AN HOUR, POSSIBLE EVEN LESS. THAT'S RIGHT, ALL OF THE PARTS WITHIN AN HOUR. I.E., THE BIG GOAL  OF THE GAME, IS ACHIEVABLE IN AN HOUR OR LESS. If they don't expand on the part customization section of the game, or at least improve what you get, I see no reason to even touch this game.\n\nAlso, you get to unlock color schemes for completing the entirety of a challenge tree. They're eyesores. And the names of these color schemes are the devs' names backwards. ♥♥♥♥ING. CLEVER.\n\nThe game's prequel was a flash game called LUFTRAUSER. With the tacked on S, it makes sense that this is not the only ♥♥♥♥ing thing that's tacked on.

Your aircraft's weapon, body, and engine are customizable, which encourages development of different tactics. Enemy spawn inconsistency adds variety to gameplay, but leaves certain objective completions largely in the hands of chance. Given the short life of a typical game (a few minutes), this randomness is tolerable, but I wish they would have toned it down. A high level of skill is nonetheless required, but you might have to burn though several dozen attempts before enemies spawn conducive to your current objectives.\n\nControls: Compact and elegant: left, right, accelerate, fire. Body/engine build choices yield different maneuverability, all of which feel beautifully responsive (some more than others for intentional balance reasons). Controls are the highlight of Luftrausers, and fans of arcade classics will love it for its feel.\n\nPresentation: Its simple graphics are immediately readable, and aircraft-specific musical adjustments make me feel like an angel of death. Menu navigation feels a bit clumsy. My biggest presentation gripe is during the "hardcore" SFMT mode, where you are continuously exposed to a blaring air raid siren. The only in-game way to eliminate that overwhelming sound is to disable sound effects, which are crucial to high-level gameplay. The appealing minimalist aesthetic is offset by flaws which could have been easily addressed.","January 5, 2015","true","33.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

BULLET HELL!!!\n\n+It is easy to pick up and hard to master\n\n+Has huge bosses/ air ships/ battleships!\n\n- Doesn't have that much content/ modes\n\nIn conclusion, this is a fun, 2-D, Fast-Paced, bullet hell, dog fight game, that is easy to play and hard to master. It has bosses and customizable features to go with that too. In my opionon it could use more content but overall I recommend.\n\n8.5/10","January 6, 2015","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The feedback loop of just one more round along with no waiting time between attempts just kept me hooked. It has a great soundtrack, one which works amazingly when your ship is in critical condition while the heroic refrain of the track blazes high as you thread the needle through a sea of bullets and coming out the other side! The core gameplay mechanic is a joy to play with.\n\nThere are some issues, notably it does not make it obvious how to quit (you can quit on the screen with the carrier). Along the same lines is that its menus could had done better. Some of the mission design (for unlocking new parts and giving you goals to work for) could had been better. Some of the parts could be better balanced.\n\nThe game does seem perhaps a little too hard. Mostly in that I shake my fists at those pesky battleships, especially when more than one start stacking together to make a cloud of death. Yet as hard as the game is, you can eventually lock a mode which turns the game into a literal bullet hell.\n\nBut on the whole, it was very enjoyable and a great surprise. Highly recommended.","January 7, 2015","true","18.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Most of them would be right; It's too hard, too short and too repeatative, but it's definitely not crap in my opinion. What evolved from a flash game had come a long way into being what it is today. I've played many bullet hells in my youth, from Striker 1942 to Project Raiden to Sylpheed and even the unknown gem that is Einhander. Most of these games however are just lightweights to the REAL bullet hells that are out there hoever; you know, the kind that have and entire screen lit up with bullets that can only be dodged by a simple tap of the joy-stick as you just BARELY make it through alive? Yeah those make this game look like a chump, but never the less, this is in fact a bullethell game.\n\nIt's a hard game to play, but the controls are simple to master. Once you understand the controls and have a better understanding of the momentum/physics mechanic of this game, the rest is left up to ou and your own skill. This game starts off simple enough, but eventually gets harder and hard with each enemy you destroy. You'll pit off against standard planes, PT boats, Jets, Battleships, Aces, missle launching submarines and even enormous blimps that act as floating combat stations. I found the game quite enjoyable, well when I wasn't trying to unlock new weapons by completeing acheivements for each peice of equipment I had on my plane. However even though I found the game quite fun, it has it's small flaws.\n\nThe game only has on song, but the song changes depending on what chasis, weapon and engine you equip. After a while of progress eventually the enemies will start to swarm you, making it almost impossible to maneuvar as enemies seem to focus more on ramming into you with no self preservation and filling up the air with a seemingly endless barrage of bullets. Some acheivements are almost impossible to complete unless the stars are aligned just right and the gods of chaos decide that it is time for you to complete your calling. Finally, once you destroy a blimp, the supposed "boss" of this game, the enemy will begin to throw everything at you INCLUDING the kitchen sink and then some, which is where you'll realize that this is pretty much when the game's decided "ok it's over, you can die now."\n\nEven with these flaws though, the gameplay feels so good and satisfying, and the music is pretty catchy, even though it's starting to lose its touch. It's a guilty pleasure that I love to play and I would recommend that people play it at least once.","December 27, 2014","true","13.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's very simple - all you do is fly around and shoot things - but it's the way it feels that makes it so much fun to play and almost impossible to put down. It has that one-more-round phenomenon going on.\n\nIt's kind of a game that has to be experienced to fully get why it's so great, but watching some videos should give you a good impression. The planes are incredibly responsive and every weapon is super fun to use. There's a ton of unlockable plane parts too, which all make huge changes to how you might choose to approach the game. This, together with the different Achievement style missions attached to each part, gives the game a hell of a replay value.\n\nVisuals and music are also amazing. The minimalistic look makes it easy to see what's going on even when there's a million planes and bullets on the screen. The music is amazing and it changes dynamically (based on your plane I think?) so you'll never get tired of it.\n\nYou might only end up playing Luftrausers for a few hours but they'll be some amazing hours.","April 22, 2014","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I wouldn't call this game a 2D Dogfighter, I would call it a bullet hell and so much more. This game has upgrades as you play, meaning that your play style will constantly be changing. The soundtrack changes depending on your upgrades, and when the game gets to a certain point the music changes completely into "Well, you're screwed" music. The game also makes you feel quite helpless, as you know you're going to die. It's addicting bullet hell madness.\nIt truly is a great game, and you should buy it, as I don't really know what else to say. For £7, $12 or €8.50 it's well worth the price.\nOn the other hand, if you don't really enjoy bullet hells, then stay away.

I might even go so far as to say it's not worth $5.  It's definitely a game you should only buy on special.\n\nNow, with that out of the way, let me start with the highlights of the game.\n\nThe graphics and music are excellent, I love the artstyle in general, it's very quirky and has a lot of personality.  The game is quite difficult but simple to play.  Easy to pick up but hard to master certainly applies here, especially if you're going for points.\n\nNow, for the bad bits. Just a forewarning, this negative impression might be coloured by my own level of skill as opposed to the game itself, but either way, here's my two cents.\n\nThough the slightly random generation of the levels does help, it doesn't feel like there's quite enough enemy variety, at least not as far as I've seen. Perhaps there's much more if you survive for a lot longer than I have but I'm a bit skeptical.\n\nThe game also focuses on combo chaining to get points but after you clear the initial wave of little planes that chase you, and if you're good enough to clear out the boats, all you're left with to kill are huge battleships, large aircraft that move much faster than you do and have a large chunk of HP, and massive airships (if you're lucky enough to have them spawn at all).  All of these enemies have too much HP for your weapons (which don't increase in power throughout your run) to take down with any efficiency, and the 5 second timer for your combo meter is not nearly generous enough for you to get more than a couple multipliers before it resets at this point.  There are still the cruise missiles and the fighter jets that streak around but the cruise missiles don't seem to appear in enough quantity and the fighter jets are too fast to reliably shoot down to keep up your combo meter.\n\nAlso, speaking of the points, due to the flaws that I perceive in the score system, it is difficult to get much more than 10,000 points in a successful run, which makes unlocking new parts a bit of a grind since it can take tens of thousands of points to unlock a single new part for your plane later on.\n\nThe final nail in the coffin for me is also the fact that, despite the interesting range of part combinations that you can put together in this game to create your own unique vehicle, I ended up feeling that the only combination that really worked to survive and score with any efficiency was pretty much laser + high HP body + fast engine.  The HP difference between the high HP body and everything else rendered almost all the other bodies moot, especially when you pair the high HP body with the high speed engine.  It doesn't help that all of these parts are quite literally the first set of parts you unlock.\n\nClearly some of this is subjective in how you approach the game, how good of a player you are, and which body combination works for you (though it's hard to imagine how any of the other bodies could surpass the massive HP difference of the high HP body), but I feel the scoring system, weapon unlock system, and the unviability of the various part combinations makes this a frustrating experience that quickly becomes repetitive.","January 25, 2015","false","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There is a weird choice to make the music track restart on launch so if you die in the first few seconds you hear a sharp stop and start of the soundtrack.\n\nStory: 1/3\nAs far as I can tell, you are a German flying the most advance plane in the war. The evil Churchill has declared total war against the Glorious Third Reich and only you can stop his relentless assault over the British Channel. You fight not for glory or for riches, you fight for the survival of your glorious empire.\n\nI don’t know if this was made by Germans or someone simply said, “you know what we have too much of? The Allies' side of the war. Let’s change that”. It wasn’t until I killed Churchill in his war zeppelin that I realized I was playing as a German.\n\nSince this is a score attack rogue-like game, it doesn’t need a story or dialog to keep you playing. It does create a uniform world with some discovery, but no great mystery. Doesn’t add or subtract anything.\n\nGame Play: 3/3\nThis game gives some great visuals to assist your gameplay. There is no health bar or ammo, thereis only the dog fight. There is no power ups or health drops, there is only the dog fight. There are no allies, there is only the dog fight.\n\nWhen you take damage, the screen starts to get narrower. To regen health, you just stop shooting. Enemies play by the same rules as you, when you crash you lose health, but you might kill the enemy. To accomplish this your plane can maintain speed after you stop thrusting. So you can fly across the screen while shooting backwards.\n\nThe controls are tight and the feedback is instant. There is a large number of supported play styles with different planes geared directly for. At a certain point you get a randomizer to add a new element to the game.\n\nRe-Playability: 1/1\nYou unlock new parts after you die, and there is one plane body that turns you into a nuke on death.\n\nShould you buy it?\nI had more fun playing this with friends than alone. Has some good value, but nothing world changing, buy on a lite sale.\nNote: single player only, you need friends in room.","February 3, 2015","true","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It also has the feel of many modern mobile games (the good ones) in its "mission" structure, its simple mechanics, and its combinatory building of airplanes.\n\nBasically you pilot a plane, shoot down other planes and boats, complete "missions" (i.e. destroy 10 boats total! destroy 3 aces in one combo! etc.) which unlock alternate weapons, bodies, or engines for your plane that have interesting abilities (this body makes it so you don't take damage running into other planes, this engine lets you survive in the water). These each come with their own missions to complete. The longer you survive on a level the more challenging it becomes; eventually an enormous blimp or laser-wielding super ships will appear. If you can destroy the blimp you unlock SFMT mode which is basically bullet hell. If you survive more than 30 seconds you're doing well.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed the arcadey aspect of the game. A single play is quick, but you want to immediately jump right back in. The missions are a nice way to give you goals to work towards. I like that each combination of parts is given a unique name. It can be brutally difficult (especially SFMT mode) but it is a lot of fun.","September 17, 2014","true","10.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"Style" goes not only for the graphics and music (though both are excellent), but also for the gameplay itself. Your warplane flies and tumbles in sharp but graceful arcs, allowing you to execute fun and deadly maneuvers to dodge seemingly impossible situations and bring down screen-fulls of enemies. The action is fast-paced and exciting without feeling mindless or overwhelming. While the basic idea of the game will seem very familiar -- in fact, Luftrausers would look at home in an old-fashioned arcade -- the actual gameplay experience ends up feeling quite refreshing and innovative.\n\nThe graphics are simple, but very attractive, and the game definitely has its own unique look. There's a lot of detail hiding in these sepia-toned visuals. A little aircraft carrier is visible in the distance, launching those swarms of fighters you're battling. As your plane explodes, a skull-shaped mushroom cloud is visible for a split second, only to be blown away by the wind. You can tell that the art department put thought and effort into their work.\n\nThe music is catchy, a kind of quasi-militaristic, but still fun, rhythm, and there's an interesting mechanic here. Your plane is composed of three different parts (weapon, body, and engine), and each has its own musical theme. The soundtrack for the game is actually the mix of these three themes put together (a mix that works quite well), and as you unlock new parts for each category, that element of the music will change, resulting in a subtly different, unique tune. It's subtle, clever, and another example of the game's attention to detail.\n\nThe customizable parts also work quite well to keep the gameplay fresh. Each part you unlock will work in a completely different way, and will require a different play style. One of the body types allows you to ram enemies, but is fragile to all other damage, and will require nimbler flight and faster reflexes; one of the engines lets you plunge underwater, allowing you to evade pursuit beneath the waves, or attack battleships from below. It works to keep the game fresh. There's tons of combinations possible as you unlock new parts in each of the three categories. And each combination has its own name, highlighting the customized plane's personality! There's that attention to detail again.\n\nIn short, it's a very fun, very stylish game, that seems quite simple, but has a many subtle details and fun quirks. It's perfect for quick but satisfying gaming breaks, but there's also enough here to keep you coming back, and to give you plenty of enjoyable gameplay time.","September 18, 2014","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The challenges presented for each module of your aircraft produce a feeling that makes you want to keep playing. Unlocking new parts and guns for the planes reaches its peak rather quickly, if you play well, so having teh challenges present for each module is a nice touch.\n\nThats all the good i will say...\n\nThe game worked great on my work pc, which was the first pc i installed it on.

I got one reply initially that led me nowhere and then the devs seemed to just give up and abandon the message boards entirely. After not getting any replies to my numerous posts and questions for over 4 months i gave up on that idea. Tried to contact them by email. No luck. Back to fixes. you guessed it, no luck whatsoever.\n\nNow i am stuck with a game that will only run on my work computer, that i can scarcely play only when i am on break or waiting around after work for a colleague.

By cutting your engine, you are able to 'stall' in the air, allowing you to shoot in any direction as your craft is carried on by momentum and gravity. I cannot dexcribe how awesome it feels to arc over a battleship as you sweep your lasers across its hull, or blow a tailing enemy squadron out of the sky with a well timed cannon shot as you fall backwards towards the ocean.\n\nAnd yes, you do have multiple weapons options for your 'rauser' (plane). There are a number of customisation options for the guns, hull and engine, which are unlocked by some algorithm tied into mission completion (see next paragraph). Though these seemingly offer different playstyles, and add something to the progession model of the game, I found that a significant number of 'upgrades' were rendered (sometimes immediately) obsolete by clearly better alternatives. For example, the nuke body will perform a screen-wipe upon your death, but these kills aren't added to your score. So apart from helping with a small number of 'kill [X]' missions, this body is outright inferior to the body that just buffs your health.\n\nThough the game is designed to be like an old-school arcade game where the main objective is maximising score, for each customisation option, there is a short string of sub-objectives. This allows you to attempt up to three missions per round, with one tied to each part of your ship. These start out simple enough, but by the end of the game, they start to veer into RNG-fests that require you to kill high-profile enemies at maximum combo. (Kill an enemy to increase combo by 1, maxes at 20; standard combo fare.) But this requires you to get a max combo, sustain a max combo, and do the three-plus attack runs required to kill the target, all in one round. If that target never spawns (submarines, you scumbags!), then tough luck. I found myself quitting out of frustration after a while, because of the increasingly unreasonable missions.\n\nHaving made those complains, I am still reccomending this game. Why? Because 'I cannot dexcribe how awesome it feels to arc over a battleship as you sweep your lasers across its hull'. I don't know how much life you'll get out of this game (it depends on your levels of perseverance), but it's cheap and the core mechanics are just that good.","August 8, 2014","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I found that the cannon was about the best you could do to rack up points, though if you are a real marksman there are other options that might suit you better.\n\nMy favorite combination is the Biohazzard Mk.

Short answer. Buy. This. Game.\nLuftrausers is a 2D, bullet hell, combo based dogfighting game which sees you playing as what is essentially a Nazi fighter pilot in not-so-WW2. You customise your "Rauser" with tonns of different parts that have their powers and weaknesses, like an engine that lets you fly underwater, but will receive more damage if you fly too high, or a body that explodes like a nuclear bomb when you die, allowing you to do a last ditch Kamikaze into one of the many enemies wanting to ruin your day. You can customise your weapon system, your body, and your engine. Depending on which parts you pick will affect the soundtrack in drastic ways.\nOverall, this game is an absolute gem. Any PC can run it, it has a load of replayability, an amazing soundtrack, slick retro visuals and at a fiver, its a bargain. Pick it up and get Rausing.","June 13, 2014","true","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
