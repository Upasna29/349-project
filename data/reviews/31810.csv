It's at that perfect balance between the simplicity of the older games, and the new types of features that seem to bog down the newer games too much. The puzzles were all fun, which I admit isn't something I'd usually say about a Nancy Drew game.","February 7, 2014","true","7.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","6","6","2","0"

Not just because Frank and Joe Hardy are along for the ride, but for the entire plot of the mystery and finding Jake Hurley's "treasure." My favorite part is putting all the gems in the machine and watching the entire room light up once everything is working. Also, the fact that they included someone from Shadow Ranch in this game was pretty rad to finally put a voice to a face. The only thing that I wasn't really amused about with this game was with the dancing shoes. I found it frustrating that every time you went to look at the paper to move the shoes, the shoes were back in their original spot. If you didn't write it down, you were sure to become very frustrated with it. Other than that minor thing, this was a great sleuthing game to come back to and I really enjoyed playing it.","June 5, 2014","true","3.5"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

The Hardy Brothers were a fun addition and I especially liked how I didn't have to spend large amounts of time wandering aimlessly around to find things as the train is much easier to get used to, in my personal opinion. If you're a fan of Nancy Drew games, or just want a fun mystery point-and-click to pass the time, get it!","December 26, 2015","true","6.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gwenna/recommended/31810/","gwenna","Vengeful Butt Spirit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gwenna/","222 products in account","My feelings are a little mixed on this game. For the most part, it's fun with a good atmosphere and entertaining characters. But while most of the puzzles are decent, when they stumble, they stumble HARD. For instance, there's one puzzle that never indicates to you that you can't solve it fully. If I hadn't looked at a walkthrough, I would have continued bashing my head against that puzzle indefinitely. There's also another plot-critical puzzle that is almost impossible to intuit on your own. (There are also a ridiculous number of steps to it) And the ending is a frustrating series of 50/50 chance rolls where if you mess up, you have to start again from the beginning.\n\nThat said, if you don't mind playing a Nancy Drew game with walkthrough in hand, this is a fine game. There were definitely times I felt excited and satisfied by what was happening--I just couldn't fully get past all of the frustrating game design choices. And if you love HerInteractive's interpretation of The Hardy Boys, then *definitely* pick this one up!","May 6","true","6.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Usako/recommended/31810/","Usako","Usagi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Usako/","1581 products in account","Positive rating just for the soul fact that the Hardy Boys are in it!\n\nAside from that, limited amount of exploring outside of the train and the mystery is pretty straight forward. Game was fun though so that made up for any of the faults. A decent ND titile and certainly nice to see the Hardy Boys in person in a game and get their help real time.\n\nBiggest gripe was Frank Hardy's voice actor, too deep and didn't fit at all. Very minor issue but it stuck out like a sore thumb whenever he spoke.","June 23, 2015","true","4.9"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

At first I did not know what to expect but I loved every minute of it. You get to work along side with the Hardy Boys on a really cool train as well as getting to meet a character you only get to talk to in Secrete of Shadow Ranch by phone (I'll let you figure out who). The other characters in the game are wonderful and diverse, the puzzles are just challanging enough to make you think and the story behind the mystery is really nice. I would definately recomend this game to anyone who is looking for a good fun mystery. :)","August 1, 2015","true","9.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
