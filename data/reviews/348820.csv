So far I really like it\n\nPositives:\n+ Great graphics.\n+ Commentary can be silly at times, but it's funnier this way.\n+ It's hard. Even in arcade mode. You're bound to crash a lot when you first start out.\n+ Stadiums are truly phenomenal and you can feel the atmosphere of the croud.\n+ Bike setup, different traction at different parts of the track throughout the race\n\nNegatives:\n- My Dual Shock 4 controller (that works with every other game) will not work with this title when racing (otherwise it works fine in menus).\n- Lackluster career mode. I wish you could create your own driver, go through SGP qualifications and then advance on to become the best. Or at least use your own customized driver\n- It's about the 2015 season which is well over by now. Maybe a 2016 DLC?","December 1, 2015","true","2.2"," 39 of 42 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","39","42","0","3"

I've met with Greg Hancock in person three times, with the whole USA Team two times including Billy Hamill and Sam Ermolenko. I also had the pleasure to meet with Nicki Pedersen, Jason Crump, Hans Andersen, Martin Smolinski and many great riders from Poland to the Czech Republic, from Germany to Hungary, from Croatia to Denmark. I have a wall at home dedicated to this sport and jeez, my window looks to the Speedway Arena of Miskolc. So yes, I know a bit about this sport.\n\nI play with speedway games since Extreme Speedway Challange which came out before the first official FIM Speedway Grand Prix 1 in 2000. I prayed many times that someday there will be a great and enjoyable speedway game out there. And here it is, the FIM Speedway Grand Prix 15 is far the best game in this genre and a must have for all speedway fans. To be honest Speedway Liga was great too but the riding experience is far the best in this new game.\n\nThe only thing I miss is a career mode where you can have you own driver and bike. The best would be if they can implement some leagues and SEC or SWC too but I know this isn't so easy because of the licensing issues.\n\nNevertheless hats down to Softplanet, they created the best speedway game which is a true rival for MXGP and other motorsport games.

The lack of advertising and the fact that it's a new series may cause some people to overlook this one, which is a BIG mistake.  If you like racing games at all, especially if you like a good challenge, this game is essential.\n\nYou don't have to be a fan of the sport: in fact, this game is already very close to making me a fan.  Basically, it's a simple game but there's always more you can do to improve.\n\nPros:\n\nThe gameplay is just awesome.  The controls are nearly perfect once you get used to them, and once you get used to the handling, it quickly becomes a classic case of easy to learn, tough to master.\n\nSounds: the game doesn't blow me away here but the sounds are more than enough to draw me in\n\nGraphics: pretty good, only real problem is lens flare is overused, but every game does that\n\nHandling: very good, it's approachable but you quickly learn to be cautious with the throttle, especially if you start to get a wheelie or touch the wall\n\nTracks: This is where the game really shines, to me.  They probably could have gotten away with building one or two tracks and changing the scenery, but every track is different and needs to be approached differently.  The track even changes realistically from one heat to the next.\n\n\nCons:\nLearning curve is steep for new players (just getting around the track is a challenge until you figure it out)\nsetup options are very limited and not well explained\n\nNo rider customization\n\nNo career mode, just a season mode\n\nVery unforgiving if you go off track, I'd like the game to give you the option to let off the gas and slow down if you go off track, so you only get penalized if you get an advantage from it.  I don't know if that would be realistic though, don't know the sport well enough\n\nBottom line: This is about as realistic as a game like this could be made, when few if any gamers have any experience with this kind of racing.  This is a very good first try, and there's huge potential for them to improve in the next game, if there is one.\n\nI recommend that anyone who is a fan of racing games buy this game, on sale or not.  If it's on sale, it's a must buy.","December 5, 2015","true","11.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","1"

It's a lot better than the old FIM SGP 3 and 4 games. The graphics of everything are really good and the stadiums look great. I've only raced in a few but Tampere in particular looks really nice. The gameplay is good. It will take a bit to get used to how it works and when you first start playing, you'll crash quite a bit. Once you get right into it, you'll have a lot more fun with the game. The career/season mode isn't very deep but it's fun to play through and fight for GP wins and the world title.\n\nIf you're a speedway fan (and you should be!) then I definitely recommend this game.

Thankfully it wasn't and the devs have done a really good job of capturing some of the atmosphere.\nThe sound of the bikes as they get ready at the tapes, the way the camera gets in there for the line up really adds to the feeling of a real race. The bike models, riders and stadiums look superb although there is a little bit of blur on background objects that looks like motion blur is working even when the game is still, but once you get riding these things don't matter at all.\nThe only thing the devs didn't capture is the smell, it's such a unique smell at the speedway with the gravel and the fuel mixed with the sounds of the bikes but we're not getting the smells until we get smellavision. But saying that the atmosphere of the game does bring back those memories of being there.\nI would love to have seen more content like the leagues and subsequently a lot more riders. I would love to have seen some classic riders put into the game like Ole Olsen, Ivan Mauger, Peter Collins, Phil Crump and a more recent classic like Tony Rickardsson etc etc and also some little touches that would have made it feel more complete like riding into and out of the pits, somewhere I spent a lot of time as a kid at Coventry (or Brandon) Bees.\nI've been to most of the stadiums in the UK to watch the Bees but now I live in the south in order to get my Speedway fix I follow Poole Pirates but not as much as I'd like to. It's a very odd feeling when they face off against the Bees though :)\n\nIt's not an easy game to master, far from it, but the simulation mode is where you'll get the best feeling of actually riding the bikes and being out there on the track. Persevere on simulation and you'll get a surprising amount of satisfaction from even finishing a race due to the difficulties of holding a line and finding good grip around the bends. You'll find yourself crashing into the barriers more often than not for the first few hours but the hardest part is riding with three other riders who want the same thing as you do, to win. After a while you'll get used to what you need to do to avoid the other riders and to get good speeds out of the bends and compete.\n\nDefault settings for your bike may have it set a little to quick with lots of torque and high rpm so I would advise turning both these down quite a bit while you are learning the game. About half of what they are set on default will help you to finish the races and still compete with the other riders. I also found putting the AI onto Hard difficulty was a help when it came to staying on the track. They stay at a good speed and are subsequently easier to avoid yet are still beatable with good riding.\n\nIf the devs keep on improving this game then it will become a classic for fans of Speedway and hopefully over the years to come we'll see more content added. For me it was well worth the full price admission.","February 24","true","5.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

But unfortunately for me no one else on the team wanted the review either, so I thought it was time to man up and review the game myself.\nSo as you can all tell by the pictures it’s a Speedway racing game, now what astonished me was that while I love Forza and Gran Turismo my heart will always go to games like Sega Rally and Ridge Racer. So arcade is what I love and after seeing a trailer for this it looks like Techland had something to do with the development and man was Nailed a much underrated game, although when you see the Steam page it says developed by SoftPlanet so again I’m not sure who did what.\n\nSo aside from a little lack of knowledge from me time to actually load the game up. This is when it comes apparent that the developer has put a lot of time into this, the game looks stunning on the intro mixed with live action of some fast racing and for someone that has never seen the sport itself even I was excited. So on the menu you have the standard options for a racing game, Season ’15, Single Heat, Single Event, Training, and then you have the options and Driving Mode where you change from Arcade to Simulation handling. Now I do really enjoy a good simulation game iRacing was a joy for a few months a while back for me. But wow I had trouble just getting around 2 corners in the simulation settings.\n\nSo Arcade it is then for the review, and even in arcade man is this one hard game to get your head around, so I’ll cover what makes sim and arcade different and the simple thing is in sim you get given much more control to every part of the race. Here you have to engage the clutch before accelerating or you stall the engine, you also have full control of the rider’s weight with the right analogue stick so when you do accelerate you need to hold forward or your rider will fall off the bike backwards after doing a wheelie.\n\nBut back to the arcade setup you don’t have to worry about the position of the rider and anything apart from turning and accelerating the bike itself, but here lies another problem and its one the developer has aced the bike feels responsive but also extremely hard to positon where you want and need it to go during a race. Here is the fun while you are fighting with the controls of the bike trying to get the position on the track and also trying not to collide with the other 3 riders during each race, man it gets the blood pumping.\n\nSo my PC is not the greatest ever and the game runs flawlessly on my setup the game looks great the bikes been the star of all the attention and the detail is simply stunning. Now I could have some nit-picks with the backgrounds but they look good and with them based on real locations the developers can’t just add buildings and background objects to make the game look better as they have to keep the locations looking like they should and they do just that.\n\nOne of the better features during the races is that the circuit grip changes between each heat and you have a small track icon that shows where the best grip is per race, you also have a little management options built in the game as with each race things like the engine, tires and frame of the bike become damaged with use and you need to buy new items or repair the old ones to keep the bike from dying during a race.\n\nNow I will say the game is missing a good career mode but when you see the game is less than £20 you really can’t complain as the game plays so well, looks this good and is only missing a few little things to get it worthy of matching some of the so called big boys in this field.\n","December 18, 2015","true","1.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

You'll find the other reviewers are legit in their assessment of FIM Speedway. Wish it supported my FFB wheel (old MS Sisewinder FFB Wheel...well i can only use the shifters to steer). I'm getting used to the XboX controller, though. Wasn't sure I would like it, as I kmow little about the sport of Speedway...now if I saw "Michael Jepsom-Jensen", I'd attack him on the street! Never heard of him, before. This game really builds up the excitement, but I would advise turning the announcer way down "cuz he has a limited choice of words he uses and it gets irritating real guick. Turning his voice down a bit worked form me. Anyway, get it. Race fan? Get it yesterday.\n\n9.5/10 could have a better choice of controls, NOT a gamebreaker, though..I'm getting used to the XboX controller, now (after 20 min of practice).","February 3","true","106.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game has a lot of Indy Car and NASCAR game like that, this is driven around the orifice ring but, this game is much more interesting and more exciting to follow in real life.\n\nIn fact, I own all the days approach larger game series of games and I like each of these, and each game version of the game has evolved and advanced, as well as genuine and changed for the better.\n\nThe game allows all the way during the pre-competition period, the ability to adjust and tune the bike with new parts. The game includes content like any game presentation as the official race drivers and tracks.\n\nA very simple but challenging game that is every time you play the diffrence.\n\nThis, therefore, very exceptional in the game for you.\n\nReferral!\n\n\nFIN:\n\nKyllä, todella kiinnostava erilainen moottoriurheilu peli. Peli on paljon Indy Car tai Nascar pelin kaltainen että, tässä ajetaan rinkiä ympäri mutta, tämä peli on paljon kiinnostavampi ja jännittävämpi seurata myös tosielämässä.\n\nItse omistan kaikki aikasemman peli sarjan pelit ja pidän jokaisesta näistä ja jokaisen peli version myötä peli on kehittynyt ja edistynyt sekä muuttunut aidompaan ja parempaan suuntaan.\n\nPeli mahdollistaa kaiken edeltävien tapaan mahdollisuuden kilpailukauden aikana säätää ja virittää pyörää uusillaosilla. Peli sisältää kaiken peliesittelyn kaltaisen sisällön kuten viralliset kisa kuljettajat ja radat.\n\nHyvin yksinkertainen mutta, haastava peli joka, on jokaisella pelikerralla erillainen.\n\nTässä siis hyvin poikeuksellinen peli sinulle.\n\nSuositteluni!","January 16","true","0.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

The graphics are good with all stadiums looking like their real life counterparts, the riders having the correct liveries, jerseys and helmet designs. However this is where the good stuff ends. The phyics engine isn't bad however riders either fall off to easily or don't fall off at all, and this, coupled with the terrible rules engine, make for a frustrating experience. The rules and refereeing of the game make me wonder if the team that built this game have ever watched a speedway meeting, with the non existence of first bend bunching and the constant wrong decisions for who is too blame for a crash. Many a time have I been chasing down a trophy or world championship only to be knocked off by another rider and been excluded myself.\n\nThe sounds don't make the game any better with the players bike either being very quiet at the start or non existent at all, with the sounds being just an audio file when the bikes are at the tapes. The sounds do improve slightly but are slow to react to the player letting on and off the throttle or hitting the fence slightly. Other misses are the lack of podiums, celebrations, the abilities to do wheelies over the line and the customisabilty that have been brought in past titles such as FIM Speedway 4.\n\nOverall the game is a let down, with many things that could have been, in a title that feels rushed so it can be out nearer the end of the season. The only thing that puts it above other speedway gp titles is the graphics which are enjoyable to look at but don't make up for the failures in the rest of the gameplay. Yes it is a speedway game however expect nothing but frustation with this title.\n\n3/10","December 23, 2015","false","6.9"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"
