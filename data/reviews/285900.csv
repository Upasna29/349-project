Do you want to be rich? Make Online and you will literally make like a million dollars, this game is near perfect even at this early of a stage, it lacks online though, add online, please? I will give you more money, take my life savings, even my soul just add online.\n\nEdit: :D so glad my review is helpful!. Also to people who want online but can't wait, I use Chrome remote desktop to share with my friends, they play with the keyboard and I use a controller, there's a little lag but it works!\n\nAll jokes aside. Really guys, Adding online would be SUPER beneficial to your support, sales, and popularity as a game company, because people don't really go over to eachother's houses as much in the current internet generation, online is most of what we do, it's easier, and even more fun! So hopefully my review is seen by a dev, and online can finally be added. :)\n\nEdit2: THEY ADDED AN ONLINE BETA!!!! SO PROUD OF YOU GUYS <3","January 17","true","16.2"," 571 of 585 people (98%) found this review helpful 150 people found this review funny","98","571","585","150","22"

There are plenty of pros and cons though\n\nPROS:\n-fun game\n- you are able to play with multiple people on 1 computer\n- 8 players\n- fun and unpredictable gameplay\n- an entertaining gamemode (NPC vs Players) for when you don't have Internet\n- The costumes are amazing\n\nCONS:\n- considering that I managed to get Skyrim and all 3 DLCs for $16, it sucks that this game is $20\n- You can ONLY play with people that are with you IRL (I know they're working on online mode though)\n- Since its new, it has bugs (for example on the map with the giant fan, if every player is on 1 side of the map there is a chance that the camera will show plain black from outside of the map)\n\nSUGGESTIONS\n- Once you got your big stuff like online mode sorted out, lower the price to around $5-$10. It's a fun game but, if you wanna get multiplayer up and running, people aren't gonna wanna pay $80 so then 4 friends can play and having only one for $20 is kinda useless unless they're with you.\n- add costumes to the game that cost around 10c each and can be bought on the Steam Market and also the Main Menu. Over time this will contribute to the money that you earn and won't be too much for people to pay whilst simultaneously not being as much work as some of the other options.\n- Give us an ability to make profiles so then we don't have to wait for up to 8 players to choose their outfit and it will also give us the ability to have a name next to our score.\n- If you are doing the 10c outfit idea, set up the workshop so people can make outfits that you could look over and put into the game\n- you guys probably won't do it but, maybe you could do a main story kind of thing, release a mission a month or something like that so there's a little more to do when you're either alone or want to play something new.\n\n\n\nGreat game, great concept, great fun\n\nRight Now: 7/10\nOnce multiplayer is up and running (assuming the HUD isn't crazy): 9/10\nIf you add the costume idea: 10/10 (I just love the outfits)\n\n\nHUD Suggestions:\n- Keep it simple, Just have 6 buttons at the beginning\n- Online\n- Offline Versus\n- Offline vs NPC\n- Profiles\n- Options\n- Exit\n- Then for the Online, have password protected servers with the hosts name and server name\n- For the options make the Up arrow on the Num Pad registered as a different one as the Actual arrows so then there's more keys to choose from when 2 people are forced to share 1 keyboard.\n\n\nPS: The only reason I have so many suggestions is because I love this game and really wanna help to make it better (even if my impact is literally nothing)\n","May 2","true","7.1"," 686 of 733 people (94%) found this review helpful 46 people found this review funny","94","686","733","46","30"

I have played this countless hours leading up to this Early Access release and I am thorougly excited about the new features and goofiness that awaits.\n\nThere is something incredibly appealing about watching plasticine-looking somewhat drunk people punch each other in the face and throw each other into dangerous situations.\n\nIf you're having some friends over for a gathering, grab some controllers and play this gem. I have not heard this much screaming since the original Smash Brothers.\n\nWe will continue to make this our end of week game in our studio, good job Boneloaf. All the best. Looking forward to every moment that Gang Beasts has to offer.\n\n*EDIT To clarify my 'countless hours' into the game. There has been an earlier copy available for months that I have been playing obsessively with work mates and friends. The Steam copy has lots of new features and tweaks that make it far superior to the old 0.0.1 - 0.0.3 version that were previously available.","August 29, 2014","true","31.9"," 500 of 585 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","500","585","2","23"

YES! It is hands down the funnest experience with friends i have ever had while gaming.\nIf you want some of the best local multiplayer druken brawling jello fighting gaming experience look no further, buy now.\n(This game does not have online or lan multiplayer, only local, so dont get upset for buying it and not having it)\nThere isn't much to say about this game other than it is amazing, just watch a youtube play of it and you will instantly know if it is for you or not.\n\nNot since super smash bros for the 64 have I stayed up so late into the night guffawing with friends. So it's simple, dont expect online, look up a youtube video, and decide if you like the idea. If you find your self laughing during any of it, you will find it hysterical among friends. Anybody I have shown this game to loves it. Even the people who profess hatred to any type of time consumption used by video games are dying of laughter when I get them to play this.\n\nSo thats that, on it's own merit as a standalone game right now it is amazing.\n\nBut... if you want to be a part of the development process called early access avoid entirely.\n\nThese developer have a nasty habit of not comunicating anything. And they only do so when they feel the torches and pitchforks rustling. I know according to early access policy devs can no longer make promises about content or delivery, but even before that policy change these devs followed through with nothing. Here is a list of promised or assurances since december that have fallen through.\n\n"we expect the release to be this year but wanted to make a post to give information on the development road map for next year and information on our plans for sharing more frequent information about the development of the game following the Unity 5 release."- Dec, 6th 2014\n\n\nThat was last year, 4 months ago, never released.\n\n\n"We have also taken on additional freelance support to help with some development and non-development tasks (support, press, events, merchandising, legal etc.) to minimise interruptions and give the time to fully engage with Early Access." - Dec, 6th 2014\n\nI haven't seen a dev on the forums since october (correct me if you personally have) This is the biggest lie since there has been absolute zero communication with the community since then. Last I personally heard from a dev was 6 month ago when I submitted a bug about the mouse cursor during gameplay.\n(and remember col. popcorn is not a dev even though he sounds affirmative like one)\n\n\n"There will be limited new content in the 0.1.6 release (similar to previous releases) but his will be followed by more significant content updates starting from January next year, we have setup a development log at beefcity.info to share frequent update information and other general development content (pre-viz images, play testing footage, technology tests etc.), the key content from theses posts will also be shared in weekly posts on Steam."- Dec, 6th 2014\n\n\nDidn't happen, that website is the same as it was when created 4 months ago, and no weekly updates on steam even once since then.\n\n\n"We will continue to work on the Unity 5 port over the Christmas holiday to try to get it released as soon as we can."- Dec, 24th 2014\n\n\nThis sounds extremly similar to the update the just fell through for March 31st\n\n\n"but we are now in a position to announce 31st March as the release date for the public build of the Unity 5 version of Gang Beasts (for reference the build number will be 0.2.0)." - Mar, 20th 2015\n\nThey skipped over update 1.6, it never happened. And as of April 1st still no updates as was promised.\n\n\n"We will make additional posts with more specific information about the new game modes, stages, character moves, and other improvements coming in the 0.2.0 build before the March 31st release date." - Mar, 20th 2015\n\n\nThey never released any new infomation leading up to the update that still has yet to be released on the 1st of April.\n\n\n\nNow again, I love this game and would recommend it whole heartedly with a thumbs up if it wasnt for the point that it was in early access. And because it is in Early Access I have to look at it that way. Don't say my review wasnt helpful just because you love this game and I gave it a thumbs down, because I love it too. If the devs were to release it now for 20 bucks as a finished product I would still love it, pay full price, and be perfectly content with what was supplied. It would  be fully recommended by me and recieve a thumbs up.\n\nBut it's not fully released, and it is Early Access, so I will review it with that in mind, And as far as Early Access goes this game is broken, at least as far as how Early Access is supposed to work. The devs do not communicate, they break promises, and we are left in the dark. Over a 7 month period we have recieved a couple of costumes and 2 levels. and that was all within the first 4 months. Having bought this game on its release date in August I had hoped to be a part of the communication between the devs and the community. But that has ceased to exist.\n\nIt's not to say the devs are not working hard porting over Unity 5, because i know it has been done. But that  was only after searching and scrounging for information from vauge places all over the web. But with early access, the devs have put up an iron curtain, nothing gets in, and nothing gets out. And after 7 months of dealing with it, it gets real old.\n\nAnd bringing this all back to today, the latest release was supposed to be on March 31st. But that came and went  and the only update about it on twitter has been that they wouldnt be able to reach that release window as promised, but that they would keep working on building the release. I know the update will eventually come out, but it sure feels like I'm in an manipulative relationship, being told one thing but constantly being delivered another.","April 1, 2015","false","23.3"," 241 of 324 people (74%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","74","241","324","16","6"

You play as a jelly man/jelly baby, fighting other jellies in a bunch of different scenarios such as on trucks on a highway, or even on a giant bong. The default controls were quite ‘meh’, so I advise them to be changed. There’s a ton of different levels, such as Gondola most of which have their own unique ways of dying/other actions, such as Gondola allows you to knock your opponents off their elevator by you yourself using your head to bash their connector wires, and make them, yourself and their gondola fall to a miserable death. You can change largely how your character looks, be a bear, a blue bear, a red bear, other creatures. The main menu is empty, it only has ‘settings’ and ‘play’ options in the main menu. Not really that great. It could go whit a level editor, full on character customisation (maybe saving presets?).\n\nGameplay\nFun, addictive, intriguing, button mash to win. You can just simply bash your head against your opponent and win 8/10 times. Then kick their KO’d body into a river of their own blood. It’s hilarious what you can do, pick up a literal giant of a jelly (2.5x the size of your jelly) and just throw them out of the ring. Sadly enough, there’s no level editor as of now, so you can’t make a death circus, however, you can still laugh at the AI or your friends. Spawn mega-AI jellies, or bring your friends along to play a LAN match or few. Sadly it’s only LAN multiplayer, no servers, so again, a downside (but who needs friends anyway right?).\n\nPros and cons\nPros:\nFun combos to pull off\nA ton of levels\nSingleplayer and multiplayer\nSupport for multiple controllers\nAmazing physics\n\nCons:\nThe singleplayer is boring\nIf you are playing by yourself, you will need to use a cheat to spawn in more enemies\nNot many game-modes\nI have been gifted the key by the kind developers of the game. They make my review about games like this possible.\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow   Game Related Universe\nCheck out the group.

We laughed 2 hours non stop because of this funny Idea.\nBut.. there are many things that could be better in the game.. For example a little tutorial-level for the controls.

Also the Singleplayer should be more fun (you can add objects and AI, but there stands nothing about it in the Game)\n\nAlso there are some bugs when a new match starts and no online mode (yet)\n\nBut all in all it's an fun game and it's probably going to be much better!

Has a lot of the type of fun not dissimilar to Super Smash Brothers or button mashy fighting games. After a thirty minute test run, it can be observed the game runs quite well even when eight players are on screen, and even at the lowest setting the game still looks very asthetically pleasing. Coming from someone who played the free pre-alpha for at least 30 hours with different groups of friends and had an absolute blast doing it, i can say i'm very excited for upcoming updates and encourage you to buy a few gamepads and round up some friends to try it; it's really the best party game i've ever played.\n\nPros:\n- Pretty cheap, indie price. (20 dollars, 15 dollars)\n- Lots of update potential from new developer. (It's also being produced by Double Fine.)\n- Functional and smooth running.\n- A good amount of levels ranging from wrestling rings and highways, to ferris wheels and meat grinders.\n- People in fox suits beating the tar out of people in chicken suits on top of moving trucks.\n\nCons:\n- When running a lot of physics calculations (especially at 8 players), the FPS can chug a bit.\n- Climbing at it's current state is difficult to pull off.\n- No way to rebind controls.\n- The very fun sandbox level has been removed, but hopefully not for long.\n- Above all, the game is in EARLY ACCESS, which means it is going to have features added constantly. While the game isn't bare bones, it lacks a single player mode and a few other features. Support the developers if you can. :)\n\nIn closing, Gang Beasts is a game i've had a lot of fun with, and patiently await more updates while i dangle my friends over pits of fire.","August 29, 2014","true","48.8"," 77 of 105 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","77","105","0","6"

As of now the game is in early access without a set date for a full release, but the devs have said they want to add more customizations, more maps, and more game modes. (Most of my cons should be fixed with a full release) Gang Beast is a fun comedic beat’em up that will have you and all of your friends laughing/ having a good time. Although this game is tons of fun now, I can’t deny that this game does not have very many stages, only one game mode, no online modes, and not very many customizing options, but looking through the devs plans for the future most of these problems will be fixed.\nPros\nTons of fun\nUnique gameplay\nUpdates to come\nGood ragdoll physics\nVaried stages\nComedic\n\n\nCons\nNot very many stages\nOnly one mode\nNot very many customizations (besides costumes)\n\n\nConclusion\nGang Beasts is a blast of a game to play with friends, and you will have a great time, no doubt at all. Unfortunately, Gang Beasts is still far away from a full release. It still needs more stages, game modes, and online gameplay. I would completely recommend you to pick this up if you ever plan to have friends over.

It seems all maps EXCEPT Bouy are lag free.  On Bouy it still has some heavy initial lag BUT after about 10 seconds it completely clears up\n_________________________________________________________________________________\nupdate 02/08/2o15\n\nI have played much more of the game now.  They added new characters with things like pudding, baulb, and more such as big head and pin head.  They have added 3 new maps since release.  Containers which is 2 shipping containers being help up by cranes.  Then their is bouy which is a bouy with ice frozen around it.  And last but not least is vents which is a place with a giant fan in the middle.  The map can push and pull you so it can be  very sketchy.  Game is still a great party game.  It seems to support ps4 controllers but usually only reads 2 controllers and doesnt read the ps3 controllers all the time.  I still will (and probably always) recommend the game.  11/10\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\nI have played both the Steam version and the pre-alpha on IDB . Overall I have played at least 3 hours and I can say I love this game! $15 (as of now) is a little much but the game will bring hours upon hours of enjoment with friends.

If you enjoyed videos of this game then it is a must-buy.\n\nEARLY ACCESS REVIEW\n0.2.5b build\n\nGang Beasts is at its best as a novelty party game.  With the right group of friends this physics-based jelly people wrestling is a blast.  Check out some videos of it on youtube.  If you laugh your head off and are desperate to play it with friends then get it.  The fighting is brilliant, and experimenting with all the different combinations of wobbly break dance fighting will earn some big laughs, and plenty of happy shouting when you throw your mate into the grinder and watch him (or her) attempt a fruitless escape.\n\nIts a bit content-light right now, but there is plenty of fun to be had, and there is loads of stuff on the way.\n\nOn to the negative.  Its not a game with a great deal of replay value unless you can organise three player matches.\nSingle player gets boring quickly after you've seen all there is to see.  You will get a lot of laughs, and certain levels will have earned a soft spot in your heart, but right now there isn't much to do past the first 45 minutes of play.\n\nPresumably, this replay factor will improve once story mode and more game modes are implemented, but right now its not a game solo fighters will want to spend $20 on.\n\nHowever if you have a couple of mates keen to play this with you then get on board.  At 40% off its a blast and well worth the money.  It even has the potential to replace Smash Bros as your go to fighting game with friends.","August 10, 2015","true","4.9"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","92","22","24","4","0"

Add a couch + some friends + some beers and let yourself be instantly swept off your feet and carried away to the land of headbutts, falling unconscious bodies, bizarre physics and tons of laughter. The sheer amount of fun you can have with this simple and wacky game is just amazing. The rounds are quick and the game is easy to pick up which makes it an ideal party game, for every kind of gamer out there.\n\nI know many people are waiting for an online update, and so was I. Until I took part in a local 4-player brawl during an evening party game session. I don't think that any online update will be able to top the fun that can be drawn from playing with someone sitting next to you, laughing together. The strenght of this game lies in its social fun factor, and nothing can beat sitting together in a cosy room, sipping on a beer and ordering a pizza together, while throwing each other into the incinerator or right under the oncoming subway.","April 24","true","37.9"," 23 of 28 people (82%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","82","23","28","6","1"

Hell. Yes.\nWelcome to Gang Beasts.\n\nThis game is truely remarkable. The art style, the gameplay, the simple yet satisfying fighting mechanics, the ever growing set of maps. And for $20? I got it on sale for $15 after I had played the alpha and beta extensively, and I get more enjoyment out of this game when playing with friends than several other $60 games I've played. I've played this game for hours on end with friends at LAN events and at houses. It really just works.\n\nThe maps are varied and interesting with plenty of map hazards (Grinders of Doom) , and the developers are adding new maps all the time. You can wrassle your comrades on top of fast moving vans on a highway, in an active subway system, in a warehouse filled with dangerous vents, in a factory with grinders everywhere in the floor, in an incinerating trash disposal plant, even on a moving ferris wheel (complete with catchy fairgrounds music).\n\nDespite the fact that it's in Early Access, It's relatively bug free compared to many other titles in the same state of development. The combat is slick and simple. You'd be surprised the maneuvers  you can pull off with just two separate punch buttons, jump, grab and a victory pose button. No online multiplayer yet. (Soon?)\n\nHowever the game, like many others, has its flaws. Before this gets too long, let's do some Pros and Cons :\n\nPros\nGreat concept and gameplay\nArt style and performance/optimization are great\nFantastic party game and local multiplayer\nGreat maps, soundtrack\nGood value for $20 price tag\nSimple and intuitive controls\nCons\nMinor Bugs\nRelatively small game, needs some more content (I know it's Early Access, but some weapons or something wouldn't hurt)\nNo AI/Singleplayer\nNo online multiplayer\nDespite these flaws (that can and probably will be fixed/changed by full release), the game is incredibly fun to play and should be an instabuy for anyone looking for a fun little game for one to eight players. I hope this review helped those who were looking for an honest review of the game!\n\nEnjoy one of the most fun fighting games I've ever played!\n- MatterMatters","August 29, 2014","true","13.6"," 45 of 67 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","45","67","0","3"

But before you guys attempt to do that, I recommend that you add the following before even attempting online multiplayer.\n\nCharacter customization...E.G Allowing the player to be a boss, tiny, weak, long arms, fat body, etc. I recommend just allowing the player to be a boss at the start of character customization.\n\nA few more maps\n\nBetter A.I for spawned npcs.\n\nMore moves for character perhaps? Headbutts? Elbows? This is a controversial idea due to not many buttons able to process the moves via controller.\n\nAfter all these things are done, do the online then. (Dont allow players to customize their character online, would be a unfair annihiliation)\n\nI reccommend this game for now, but the updates are slow given, could you please give a direct time for the next update so we are not guessing all the time.\n\n--APPROVED--\n\n","November 15, 2014","true","76.5"," 27 of 36 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","27","36","0","2"

It was so fun! I was dissapointed at the fact that there was no online multiplayer but there is local so heads up! This game is Incredibly worth it but only if you have enough people (3-8) to make it fun! Also using the keyboard is awkward so have controllers for everyone!\n\nFixes I hope for: I think the big problems are that the camera is kinda funky at the start sometimes, and that its lame 1 punch can knock you out sometimes. For some reason I cant get a nice resolution to work for full screen on my 32 inch TV but that could just be me.\nAlso I think adding an optional mode with a timer would be nice. Incase that one pesky friend never lets go of the car!!\n\nThings I like: the fact that you can climb with enough practice.

I will have to thumb down if they don't address some pretty serious issues soon. I don't mind the lack of online play, I purchased the game knowing about that, with plans to play with friends locally, WHICH IS A TON OF FUN, for the most part. The biggest issue for me is how long it takes to transition after a round is over, the fade-out is super long. The music sucks (hey devs, buy my music, cheap!) but that's OK cuz you can just turn it off easily and put on your own tunes. They made it so you can turn down the annoying creepy voices too, so high points for sound options. The game REALLY needs to be opened up to the Workshop for users to develop their own vocal profiles, colors, and uniforms for the Beasts, either that or the devs need to flesh out a LOT more material for a $20 price tag. Don't get me wrong, overall this physics-based party game is full of great ideas and natural, intuitive, fun mechanics, it just needs a lot more polish for the money. On a side note, a good deal of the motions the Beasts end up making often look like common BJJ moves and positions. #HelioLives 5.5/10, could be 9/10","February 22","true","4.8"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","16","19","2","0"

(finally) for all of us on Steam, using any desktop OS too \{}^__^}/\n\nIn long ...the free pre-Greenlight version (about 6-7 months ago) had a lot more to it from what I remember and hope it's all brought to this Steam version, because depsite it being still in Early Stages, it has SO much potential and is already a serious LoL game in our cave. So apart from the above and one day soon, we all get a finished version, I hope on that, they push the graphics a little harder too. I love the fun styling it has, but the environments need more, it could do with more physics havoc with usable/breakable objects and if this going to ever get on-line multiplayer, it 'needs' voice comms too.\n\nRandom ideas ...to fight in and all still in the style of Gang Beasts ...simulated real-life locations, film remade scenes, dramatic weather, a horror theme with blackout moments where can only see the eyes of the fighters and other odd things (Slenderman apperance, etc), an office enviroment (everyone in male/female office attire), a black and white level (with grain) where it really makes it hard to know who is who ...yeah ...you can probably tell I like Gang Beasts, but I also see it could have/be a lot more []^__^]\n\nGameplay: You can only play two players and upwards and only locally too, which also means no actual single player campaigns, etc.\n\nOptions: None really ...there are no adjustment features in terms of controls (binding, keyboards, joypads, how many, etc), audio (levels, channels (2-8Ch's), on/off preference, etc), visual (quality, physics, resolution, 3D Stereo, etc).\n\nMore: I have a feeling that Boneloaf will either make micro-payments within the game to get more costumes/gear/funny weapons (maybe) or maybe adapt it to use Steam Workshop, which would be everyones choice really, but means of course Boneloaf need to do some real work here to make that happen and soon.\n\nI recommended Gang Beasts, but with caution at present, because it still is in Early Stages ...but the more support Gang Beasts gets, Boneloaf will (hopefully) push it a lot further and within the next three months finish it ...maybe ()?__?)","August 31, 2014","true","3.0"," 53 of 90 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","53","90","0","0"

It is a local multiplayer fighting game that is very fun in my opinon. It has very fun gameplay along with nice controls, well as nice of controls that you can get for a doughy puppet. There are also several costumes in Gang Beasts that you can wear while beating up your friends. As for maps there are not a ton however not to small of an amount for a game that is in deveolpment game, and almost all of the maps have something that can be moved or destroyed on them. Now on to the audio in Gang Beasts the tracks that play in the background are quite nice for a developing game. Well I am done here I hope that this little review was helpful to you in choosing if you will buy Gang Beasts or not.\n\nreview wrote on 11/2/2014\n","November 1, 2014","true","6.5"," 20 of 30 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","20","30","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/officialcontorted/recommended/285900/","officialcontorted","Contorted","http://steamcommunity.com/id/officialcontorted/","36 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSo I bought this game a while back and I've been playing it almost whenever a mate comes around from wherever the Hell they live and take a break from whatever the Hell they're doing. It's just occured to me that the only time I happen to actually care about what my mates are doing is when either it concerns me or it concerns something that may also happen to concern me. If I was any more uninvolved in what my friends were doing I'd be completely irrelevent to their daily lives. Like a small peice of chewing gum on a pavement somewhere. It also just occured to me that I'm an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, so none of that matters so me anyway.\n\nGang Beasts! Another excitingly simple game that was generated on IndieDB, which seems to be one of the hottest places to get indie games from. I suppose that Steam just starts selling whatever stiffens their willies, as a lot of the stuff from IndieDB seems to end up on Steam. Anyway, Gang Beasts is a arcadey, 3D fighting game in which players control questionably stable jelly babies as they brawl and fight for no apparent reason. It's like the whole premise of the game is a plot hole and the developer excuses this plot hole by saying "because" and then stops halfway as a hair gets caught up in the gears of his brain. But enough offensive jokes.\n\nOne reason I probably enjoy Gang Beasts more than my other arcadey Steam games is that it's entertaining. Not just the sort of entertaining where writers stick Seth MacFarlane in a booth, get him drunk, then write down whatever offensive dialogue dribbles out of his ♥♥♥♥♥. I'm talking about that wonderful kind of entertainment that sort of comes naturally and sort of makes you queestion whether it was intentional or not. Like when a Micheal Bay movie actually does something good.\n\nThe charming simplicity and art style of the game make it somewhat hilarious to watch the wobbling mutants flop about, throwing punches and making hysterical floppy laughing noises with their nonexistant mouths. That, of course, makes me further appreciate that the game is a multiplayer game! Yes, you can enjoy the wibbly wobbly laughing noises, not just alone, but with friends! Which also makes it ten times more fun as playing alone is sort of boring, unless of couse you've discovered how to use Dev mode, which, on this particular game, is about as much use as a knitted condom.\n\nI wouldn't say the game is perfect. The lack of online multiplayer makes multiplayer in general extremely hard. "Yes, you and your mates can play this game together, but they have to drive down to wherever the ♥♥♥♥ you happen to live in order to do so" Unless you live near your best mate, live near your Siblings r at least have a sex slave locked away in your basement, multiplayer can only be accomplished when the second, thid and fourth player are in the same room as you, playing on the same PC.\nAlso, this game is buggy. Not just the sort of buggy where there's that one part of that one map where you can walk through a wall, but the sort of buggy where you look down to see that your leg is halfway up your ♥♥♥♥ buggy. The character models seem to have a feud underway with the laws of physics, as characters tend to just randomly dart in one direction, as if someone's just landed a roundhouse kick on their left testicle. Also, for some reason, the game doesn't seem to have a damage system at all, since you can be absolutely drilling at someone's head only for them to land a single headbutt and send you flying onto your backside.\n\nHowever, despite the game having more bugs than a Dog with worms, the charming way in which the game is styled makes me unable to refuse its' shiny, colourful, seizure-inducing fun that I get from playing it. If I was going to say anything about this game, I'd say it's probably better to approach it as someone who's played many Indie games before. It's seemingly the embodyment of what we expect from Indie games. It's simple, it's funny, it's cute and it has about as much potential as a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with worms. It may be shiny and it may LOOK good, but once you're inside it you can practically sense the bugs. And, yes, I was going for offensive that time.","May 2","true","129.0"," 20 of 30 people (67%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","67","20","30","9","1"

The game has also got a really cool sountrack and good graphics (well, untextured models, but the effects like shadows and lights are incredibly good; and said untextured models are really nice actually...).\nIt's REALLY funny to play with friends, even when alone it's not that bad since you can have fun with props and the A.I. enemies (you can spawn A.I.s and props in the stage anywhere and anytime using the number keys on the keyboard) but they are pretty dumb at this stage of developement so playing with friends is funnier and more convenient; the Race and Smash game modes are also a good addition to the game when you don't feel "punchy"...\n\nI really suggest you to buy the game if you have some friends (and controllers), it's gonna give you many hours of silly fun! If you don't have them buy the game only if you really liked the Pre-Alpha or if you enjoy physic-based games...\n\nEDIT: Don't look at the playing time counter: I actually played the game a lot more but I was in Offline mode so it didn't count...","December 24, 2014","true","79.1"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","7","7","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/recommended/285900/","rockstarcro","RockstarCRO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/","252 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI thought this would give Super Smash a good run for it's money as a PC version. Upon playing the game more, it's hard to say if I could even put it in that category. Gang Beasts is largely a physics based game with some interesting soft body physics. There are no real weapons but it seems like wrestling turned into a cartoon. At first glance, this game can get pretty intense but releasing it without multiplayer is sort of a risky gamble (check the discussions how many times multiplayer was asked about).\n\nThis game is fun and has some seriously different gameplay. The pretense behind the game as seen in the videos look awesome. I would consider the game to be a "bash 'em-up" sort that relies on luck a bit as well as your skill. As of now there are a few basic movements : punches, kicks, jump and crouch.  Each bumper (assuming you're using an xbox controller for pc - so "RB" and "LB") controls each individual arm. You can one-punch or two-punch opponents as you please. Holding the bumpers will make the player hold out their arms engaging them into a "grab" position. In this position, players may either grab onto a wall and begin climbing or grab onto another player. Grabbing onto an enemy and pressing "Y" will lift the enemy into the air. Careful though, the opponent can grab onto you too and attempt to lift you at the same time. When both players are engaged in grabs it can be difficult to maneuver the opponent where you want. This is where kicks, jump and even crouching come in to change the angles and give your advantage back. To climb a wall, the player has to play a little bit with the jump button and the grab buttons. Holding "A" will have your player sort of scoot up and prepare to launch themselves in the air to grab at a higher altitude. Being able to climb anything in the environment is a pretty cool feature to say the least. It does take some skill to get to where you want to be!\n\nThe way to win the game is to eliminate the other opponents VIA throwing them off the map. The players can be thrown but a conscious player is difficult to pin. Throwing enough punches can knock a player out which makes it easier to get them over. Then, once the player is down and out, this opens an opportunity to throw the player over the edge. Button mashing "A" will wake your player up and may even give you a window to grab onto something and recover. Be careful though as you can knock yourself out! If by chance you hit your players head on something (either jumping or falling from a great distance), your player will become unconscious! The game itself now can be played with one keyboard or if your lucky, you'll have multiple controllers on hand to play with. Is it as fun as everyone writing in capitol letters says it is? Not to the extreme point of their bold letters. Up to 8 players can play at the same time and the more players you have, the more intense and enjoyable the game becomes. This is where multiplayer is crucial in this setting. It's nice to have local play but it's sort of difficult to fill 7 slots at all times you want to play.\n\nThe graphics suit the environment and tone the devs were trying to accomplish. The simplicity but attention to color and detail is what gives this game it's own character. The soft body physics, the light colors and the insane level designs is what adds an extra interest. The levels themselves are extremely fun to play in and diverse. The devs have taken to the forums and have asked players where they would like to fight their friends (a big + )! Some locations include levels that have grinding wheels in them, fighting on a billboard, on top crates suspended in mid air by a crane, in the artic, on moving trucks, a gyro level where fans can push or pull you and a classic ring. The sounds have improved since it's inception and there is even music added to some of the levels and the main menu. Players can hear other players laugh, get hit, get knocked out and even make noise when they're moving about or making a move. Both these realms have still ways to go but are definitely on the right track.\n\nOverall, the game is good, the concept is good and it seems like it can be extremely fun. It's fun for what is it now but isn't certainly worth the price unless you care about this game and hope the devs do. There is huge potential here. If the cards are played nicely I can see Fuzion Frenzy meeting Super Smashing Brothers. Hopefully some sort of mini-games get added be it objective focused or some sort of brawl. They have added a waves like game-mode just recently though! I'm hoping for more maps, detail, game modes, and especially party modes. I wouldn't mind seeing random objects added that players could pick up and possibly use. There is the ability to press (0-9) the numbers on the keyboard to spawn random objects with the click of the mouse. That's something!\n\n\n\nEARLY ACCESS RATING : 6.75/10\n\n\nedit 1 : xbox 360 controller works.\n\nedit 2 : logitech computer controller (wired) works for this game incase you don't have an xbox controller.\n\nedit 3 : PS3 controllers work as well (with certain programs/software).","August 30, 2014","true","6.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Only to introduce them to a game they'll want to play for revenge the next time they're over. So let me start off by saying for one this game is absolutely amazing and don't understand why people are giving this game so much hate when there isn't an online multiplayer.\n\nGive me a moment to point something out\nThe game DOES have ONLINE MULTIPLAYER\nIt is, however; still in BETA\nThe way to obtain said multiplayer is not through steam itself, check out news for the game and you'll be given directions to get a key for the multiplayer.\n\nWith that out of the way the game is extremely fun when you finally get the beta for the online multiplayer. It's all in the patience since the keys for the beta are taking an extremely long time to get out to the public, but hey, it'll make the game that more enjoyable when they start giving them out a lot more often.\n\nAdressing some of the controls I would have to recommend using an gamepad, like an xbox controller or whatever console you have that just so happens to have a usb that can be used. Incredibly difficult to use the keyboard.\n\nGraphics are absolutely flawless with the hilarity that it comes with. Sure there are a few drawbacks with bugs within the meshes or whatever reason people have to hate on the game with because of the outrageous graphics standards some gamers have come to expect. I find the physics of this game to be hilarious and extremely enjoyable to the point that I don't even pay attention to the minor graphical details within the game or how the physics work because thats what adds to the fun of the game is to... watch it glitch or break for a few moments.\n\nPaying attention with the recent updates with the game there are ways you can add replay-ability within the game itself even if you're going solo because for some reason you have nothing else to do. Pressing CTRL with #9 will spawn a big BEEFY (Beef city.. heh..) AI enemy for you to mercilessly bombard with headbutts and the flailing of whatever you to can throw at it only to immerge victorious and throw him into a grinder... Ahem.\n\nThis game is definitely recommended especially when you have friends over... brothers/sisters you wanna get revenge on for picking on you... or to jump on your friends when you all finally get that sweet, sweet online multiplayer key...","June 1","true","12.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Certainly a very promising party game with a fresh take on the genre. Given how early in development the game currently is, it's quite an achievement that it's already this entertaining.\n\nDepending on the direction they take this, it could become anything from "fun for a lazy afternoon" to "the party game you and your friends have been unknowningly waiting for".\n\nGiven the current progress it could very well be the latter. But if it turns out to be the former, they'll have to drop the price for me to recommend it.","April 19, 2015","true","3.4"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","8","12","0","0"

Although that isn't the whole premise of the game, it does invole that. It is a hilariously great game and will give you such a great time. The sad thing about it is that it is only LOCAL multiplayer. No online or computer players (although the developers are working on that) In the meantime, while you wait for that online multiplayer, you could always buy this and get some friends so you can;\n\nPunch eachother, kick eachother, grab eachother, throw eachother, drop eachother, KO eachother, hug eachother, ride a ferris wheel with eachother, throw your friends into a meat grinder, throw your friends into an ocean, throw your friends into a train, get stuck in an elevator, die in an elevator, fall off a building, throw someone off a building, punch the ground, jump in fire, break a shelf, ride a conveyer belt, climb a wall, go on a boardwalk, mess with gravity, get sucked into a fan, grab onto a moving fan, float above a fan, get stuck on a glacier, break a glacier, get stuck on the piece of a glacier floating away from the bigger glacier on which your friends are on, die trying to swim back to your friends, and much, much , much, more.","June 4, 2015","true","50.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

You punch, kick, headbutt, and can do combos, or awesome moves.\nI really like it, but I wish there was AI's in the game, you can spawn them in any map, put I'd like to see a map with them, like the 'streets' map from the old version. Or an island with an AI with a beard and stuff. For some reason I would love that.","September 8, 2014","true","49.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The only really "Solo" mode in this game as of right now is Waves which can get boring due to it only having one map and being the same thing over and over and over again!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KingAnderson34/recommended/285900/","KingAnderson34","KingAnderson34","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KingAnderson34/","5 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game is the bomb, or in this case, the beast.  After playing the pre-alpha version of the game with my brother, I fell in love with this game so much.  I especially loved the cute chubby character and the ragdoll animations in the game.  We've played this with one of my friends, and he enjoyed it as well.\n\nNow, as for the Steam Early Access edition of the game, I was surprised on how much change was put into the game when I first tried it out.  At first, I wasn't use to the controls as I did in the original alpha version.  But, I kept praticing and I found the Early Access edition was fun too.  It wasn't as fun as the original version, but it was still very fun to play.\n\nThe thing I like about the Steam Early Access edition of the game was the enhanched graphics, the feature of customizing your character, plus the new stage, "Vents."  My brother and I played on that map just to throw each other into the vents and to see if we could make the bridge collaspe.  It was such a blast.\n\nWhile I love this edition of the game too, I do miss the "Sandbox" and "Street" stages and the old character animation.  If they can bring those back before the final release, that would be great.\n\nOther than that, I really think this is a GREAT game.  It's got a good concept, and gives such a funny and fun experience to remember.  I like this game.  I like it.  I really like it.  Also, after hearing they would support online multiplayer in the future, and a possible story mode feature, I knew that this game would be a smashing, smack-down success, just like "Battleblock Theater."  I seriously can not wait for the final release to come out.\n\nSo to sum it up, I strongly recommend this game.  Although the Steam Early Access edition might have a few problems and be a little buggy, I really encourage you to give Boneloaf a chance.  Who knows?  If you do, well, I can only say that Gang Beasts will be one of the most enjoyable and memoriable games you could ever have in your Steam library.  So, what are you all waiting for?  Come join the gang, and buy the Steam Early Access edition of Gang Beasts and have the life of a party playing this game.  I know that I have.  And so have my brother and my friends.","October 2, 2014","true","0.2"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

I wish these indie devs (if there's a better term I don't know it) the best of luck with this game, even though they will probably never read this.

Well, anyway the game has a fun arcade feel to it, making it fun to beat up other naked people as you please. The game is still in need of some development, but overall wight he functions and A.I. of the Cpu. It makes it a fun game to spawn in 10 bosses, and get the crap kicked out of you! Watching Naked people is better than it has ever been!\n\nBut this game again needs some improvement. The game lacks a great singleplayer, you can pick a map and spawn in a ton of CPUs and fight, but what I would love to see is a couple featured map and a Team deathmatch, where you pick the amount of CPUs you want to fight with you (They will be the same color as your character) and then pick the amount of enemies. Then add maps for this specific game-type, so longer maps that have proper details and fetures to feel like a proper tdm. Also, a multiplayer would be fantastic (Pretty sure this will be added in the future) being able to go online searching for opponents and picking a specific game-type to play, then battling to the death with friends    would be great and more fun then ever, makiing this game a even more popular and fun game then right now!

I would recommend this game to alot of my friends, but the only downside I have found is that you cant play online... (yet they said they are making an online! :). But for now its a fun game to invite your mates over and to just play around for the heck of it. I had 4 mates over we were gonna play another game, But we spent about 4-6 hours playing gang beasts while not concentrating on anything else going on. I recommend this game to people who invite mates over just for fun, I rate this game a 8/10 (Negatives: Probably the fact they removed controller remapping) but they are adding it back! :) :)","September 23, 2014","true","31.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

First, miss key personalization, the controls are fine, but for example, in xbox controller would like to use RT and LT for hitting and no RB and LB. Second, new modes, actually just survival. And finally, an option to choose which colour you want to be.\nAlso would be really nice if they add online mode.\n\nBut in general its a great local fighting game, really funny.","September 19, 2014","true","9.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Grizzly232/recommended/285900/","Grizzly232","Grizzly","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Grizzly232/","103 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nRight off the bat, I'll say that this game isn't worth it if you can't play with a friend. There is still about 4 hours fun in singleplayer, just spawning in enemy AI and attacking it, and the combat is extremely satisfying, but you'll end up getting bored quickly if you plan on playing by yourself.\n\nThat being said, with friends, this is THE party game. Not only is it fun, but thrilling, unpredictable fun. Unpredictable in the sense that this game will constantly take you by surprise, whether that surprise comes in the form of your unconscious friend regaining consciousness and suddenly uppercutting you into a pit of fire, or with you accidentally sparta-kicking your friend through a pane of glass on an elevator, there's a lot of sudden surprises.\n\nIn Gang Beasts, you're in complete control. Every move your character makes is a result of your actions, and combat isn't just built on static animations. You get real satisfaction knowing that you finally uppercutted someone off the side of a moving truck without the aid of a quicktime event or a static animation to do it for you.\n\nNot only does this game have brilliant combat, but also brilliant parkour. Dare I say it, but Gang Beasts almost rivals Grow Home for parkour. Between climbing to safety on a dangling window cleaning platform while your persistent friend tries to break the only cable still holding said platform, to swinging through an elevator window and doing a falied backflip before concussing yourself on the floor, it is very responsive and leaves you drastically clutching your controller.\n\nThe downsides, of course, are the lack of online multiplayer and mod support. Not even full blown mod support, but just the ability to make your own levels. Online multiplayer speaks for itself. With that, you could discredit my entire spiel about the singleplayer part of this game.\n\nSo, if you enjoy fighting games and party games, GET THIS. Of course, there is a bit of a technical side involved with hooking up controllers and such, but once you sort it out, you've got a flawless party game that'll keep you satisfied for hours on end.","February 23, 2015","true","24.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

The only problem was is that I had barely any friend to play it with, BUT, they added a debug menu. And that's how I got more into the game, because of this, you can spawn ai. Big dudes with stubby legs and normal guys. And then the 'Unstable' build released. Jesus I haven't laughed so hard in forever, it's so glitchy and... Well, unstable. The ai are grey now, but I don't mind, the debug menu is there of course and there is also prototype modes.

But it is pretty lonely when you're not doing multiplayer. Even though the game still has its issues, maybe give it a chance. It's still in early access. Thats why people are sometimes giving negative votes about the game. I got my copy for the reason that it was on sale, so I recommend maybe getting it when it comes out, or it goes on sale again, instead of just buying it and waiting for the full version to come out.

But it is pretty lonely when you're not doing multiplayer. Even though the game still has its issues, maybe give it a chance. It's still in early access. Thats why people are sometimes giving negative votes about the game. I got my copy for the reason that it was on sale, so I recommend maybe getting it when it comes out, or it goes on sale again, instead of just buying it and waiting for the full version to come out.

The game was hilarious while it lasted. It really did remind me of what it was like to be a kid and laugh my butt off while fighting friends in a video game. But eventually, the lack of content made the game quickly become boring.\n\nAs it stands, it's alpha-alpha-alpha. It's got all of ~5-6 maps, and each map lasts 30 seconds to a minute in a typical battle. Do the math there. They really could of, should of, added more than twice the content into this release before going to Greenlight. Compare it to half the other games on here and this game is almost empty.\n\nI do recommend the game, in the hopes that they add a ton of content. But as it stands, $20 is very expensive for what right now amounts to a very simple Unity tech demo. A demo that could have been thrown together in a weekend by a more experienced group of developers.\n\n","September 8, 2014","true","0.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

Gang beasts is the perfect game for local multiplayer. It will make you laugh so much watching as you and your friends (or rivals) fling eachother into the ocean, off of moving vehicles, into moving vehicles, into greusome grinders or large fans, or simply out of a boxing ring if you dont feel man enough. Saying that, its also a game where you can be competitive, and see your friends face as they grab your hand, with a look in there eye that could only mean "Please, have mercy!" before you drop them into the forementoined ocean - and so on.  The free downloadable version on the internet is similar to the one you can buy here, but this steam version does have more things such as costumes, a new map, slightly changed maps, much better graphics and smoother animations.

Since the latest major update the game has been much better. With better visuals, maps, animations and moves, Gang Beasts has become one of my favourite games to own with hours of replayability value to it. This game is a must buy!\n\nHowever, until the multiplayer is released, I would not recommend buying due to it's relatively high price-point for what it is. Unless you are living with a large group of people like me, it is difficult to see how the average gamer would get their uses out of this locally multiplayer game!

In videos and on stream one can see players going against each other and/or people spawning in bots to fight on interesting looking maps. However this is unfortunately not the actual game. In order for one to have this you need to spend $20 dollars then wait for you to hopefully get accepted into the beta to then and only then play what you've seen.\n\n\n\nIN THE CURRENT VERSION 5/26/2016\nWhen you buy this game you get ONE GAME MODE against bots called "survival". Bots spawn every round increasing in number each wave. On ONE MAP called "rooftop" which is basically just a flat map with edges to fall off. This one game mode and map get BORING very quickly and after one good hour there is nothing more to do.\n\nALL IN ALL\nThe $20 it calls for is way to much for you to have too wait a month for a beta. If you buy a $20 game you expect the game and everything you've seen. Especially when they don't say that everything seen is in the closed online beta. This is just a shame, a great game that i can't play for another month or two.","May 25","false","1.6"," 9 of 18 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","9","18","0","1"

Although at the moment there are no options for controls which is only slightly annoying. But anyhow its still great and you should buy it!\n\nI have played 0.0.3 and 0.1 and don't even know how many hours of gametime I have on 0.0.3 but what I can say is its a good investment. The main thing to remember is that its still in its early alpha builds, which means its not perfect at the moment (what game is at this stage?), however you can still enjoy it, and as they continue to update it you will be able to get more and more out of the game.\n\nI've seen a lot of people complaining about it and I have to disagree with them, it is a bit disfigured at the moment yes, but it will get better and if you buy it, it'll get better fast!\n\nEdit:\nOn further playing I am finding it better and worse, levels like Grind and Vents are fps killers, which is unfortunate because Vents looked like a fun map. Pressing TAB will give you info on controls (not changable yet however) and climbing is very fun!

In the future updates i would hope to see bots battling with each other aswell, (bots vs bots), this will make the game more funner because everyone would be going for an all out brawl with each other and it makes the game more intense.

Buy yourself that DLC you've always wanted or something to pass the time until the weird beta is available to all.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTL;DR: Good idea of a game, shame the actual content you get at purchase is poor. Beta access only available through request that can take an extremely long time.\nYou'll see people playing this game on Twitch or Youtube. Playing online with 8 people and it looks a hell of a lot of fun, it's had me laughing more than any game I've played*.\n\nBut when you go to buy the game, it fails to mention that what you'll be buying is some really old version that hasn't been updated in such a long time.\nThe survival mode on the version you'll get you might survive a few rounds but it gets boring really fast.\n\nIn order to play with people online like you'll see on Twitch/Youtube you need to apply to join the beta.\nThis wouldn't be a problem if the game you get for your £11.99 wasn't so boring on it's own.\n\nFor the price they're asking, I can't justify the purchase. I'm really hoping to get into the multiplayer beta before the 14 day refund option passes by that time my hype would have died off anyway.","May 25","false","0.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Strange game. I have played this a lot before the early access, and it is just fantastic! The simplistic controls and graphics are so cool.\n\nAlthough, I am rather sad they took out the Street and Sandbox level. I played those a lot with my younger niece, and we had a lot of fun!\n\nRegardless, it is actually rather fun to just place 3 other players and play on your own!

If you are playing on a lan with your friends, this is the game to play. A massive improvement over the demo. First of all the movement is so much better, instead of waddling along moving quite slowly they now made the characters run. This makes the game a lot faster then it used to be. You can also climb which is very useful for getting over ledges that you are hanging from instead of falling to your death. They have made the celerbrate move and lift action on the same button which I find to be better. You can turn the health and stamina bar on or off if you feel like it.You can now also K.O. someone much faster than before as you could take so many punches before going down. You can now were costumes! There is about 8 costumes which gives some variety to the characters. There is 7 maps ans sadly they got rid of the sandbox and street maps, but they maps will forever be in our hearts :(. If enough people stand up we can make them bring back the those two maps. None of the maps have AI so you can only play with friends. You can choose how much lives you get, max is 100 lives. This game supports 8 players, but I tell you 8 players is FPS EATER!!!, unless you have a high-end PC you are fine :D. There is no control mapping which is pretty stupid as some people would like to change the controls. so you don't need to try and figure out what the controls are I will list them for you:\nPC\nMove- WASD\nLeft punch- left click\nRight punch- right click\nJump/climb- Space\nDuck- Ctrl\nLift/celerbrate- Left shift\nKick- E\n\nXbox controller\nMove- Left analog stick\nLeft punch- LB\nRight punch- RB\nJump/climb- A\nDuck- B\nLift/celerbrate- Y\nKick- X\n\nIn other words this game is so awesome and you should definitly buy it. If enough people buy the game the dev's will make ONLINE MULTIPLAYER!!! That would just be awesome!","August 31, 2014","true","68.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","4"

You can play this with 8 controllers and have endless fun with friends at LAN-parties and/or school etc. This game looks beautifull even when there is not much graphics and textures on the game on this early stage(Still a good game for even laptops). This is one of the good "Steam Early Access" there is in the market, since this game can support multiple controllers, witch you don't see many games support now a days. There is still some few bugs, but even though, it creates a hilarious experience to all the players, since the bug is about the physics, where the ragdoll spas out, and then you getting thown out of the arena.\n\nYou buy this game, ask some friends at your school or where you are at now, and ask them "You must beat me in this game" then everyone having a fun time, they always ask me the same question after they tried the game "Can we try that game again? Want to try beat you again". Even friends that don't play controller games. The controls are easy to learn, and still want to try it out again.\n\n10/10","October 27, 2015","true","39.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","2"

I love the new customization but I really hope they bring the sandbox map back. Now that that is off my chest I would life to say that this game is awesome. it occasionally glitches out (i was playing with my friend who had the fez hat on and it was flying across the map and stretching out a lot.) but there is nothing game breaking. The gameplay is amazing. it is a beat em up where you get to punch your friends in the face.

In the last week this game has improved considerably. I am getting pretty impressed. Incredibly silly and fun. Needs more game modes.\n\nIssues I am having now:\nSome of the graphical settings don't seem to apply, making the game really annoying on an under powered laptop. I keep trying to turn off VHS, turn off the bloom, and change the effects to FAST, but they don't apply, therefore those adjustments are useless.\nAlso, when you play on the Rooftop, against the different waves, sometimes they don't spawn and you just kinda sit around.

For starters theres no tutorial in alpha, so u have to know the buttons from the original gang beast. Theres no story mode in alpha and with that being said, theres also no AI for you to randomly fight bots, so literally its just you and motionless people if you dont play with local people. Thats just before you play btw, now game wise: if you're on a certain part of a edge, you cant get back up, you're done. Fighting stamina needs to be longer or knockout need to be shorter cuz if you punch a certain way the person will knockout your guy but your stamina will still say you're concious still however the person can just free punch you till u are out conscious and even then he can punch u all day just to troll and you cant move. I think there doesnt need to be a knockout stamina unless its a game mode, you should just keep fighting till the person kicks you off completely by fighting hard for it, cause it be more fun to fight and throw out a concious person then one knocked out concious. I liked the potential of this game but i have no idea why they would release it in alpha, however when they fix all the major stuff, i will suggest this game to all.","September 3, 2014","false","6.2"," 18 of 38 people (47%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","47","18","38","3","0"

I've played the game a lot, nearly 4 hours with my friend and we've had loads of fun but once you've done everything there is the do, the novelty starts to get a little old with nothing new to find and all the secrets discovered. I will strongly recommend this game when there's news of new updates and a final release but until then.

This means having to go into the options menu again and changing everything back, with 2 second delays in between each keystroke.\n\nIt boggles my mind how a relatively simple game with four characters throwing each other around in a small arena is more intensive on my system than games like Fallout 3, Oblivion, or Borderlands 2.\n\nUnless they fix the graphical issues, I'd recommend saving your money.","January 2","false","35.8"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","4","10","0","0"

Instead, you get predictable and repeating wins from the players who have mastered the (fairly awkward) controls.  Some of the maps also tend towards boring play and stalemates if people try to play competitively (obviously you shouldn't "try-hard" too much in a game like this, but I hate games that sort of make you choose between "playing fun" and "playing to win").\n\nGame needs more chaos, more variety, and simpler controls.  It's not bad (and it can create some hilarious moments) but ultimately too frustrating to recommend..","November 17, 2015","false","4.2"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

But then i selected play and a map and started hitting the controls. i thoughat i told it tot that i was using the wrong controls until about 3 mins later it finally did what i told it to. after a while i refreshed the game and came back on but it was still extremly laggy.  Im angry about this because i spent my own money on a gane that lags. i wont get a refund because if you decide to fix the lag ill sure to have a good time. I would recommend this game to others AFTER they fix it because otherwise its just a waste of money.","March 2","false","4.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mumblesh/recommended/285900/","mumblesh","Mumblesh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mumblesh/","136 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThe thing is I really want to rate this game highly, but I just can't bring myself to do so in its current state. The idea of some crazed drunken blobs trying to kick each other out of a ring, is kinda fun. I love local multi-player games like this.\n\nAlas so much seems broken, like some occasional crashes, the fact that pausing the game quits it, which can be turned off from the menu (something not right here), which occaisonally (the menu) doesn't work using a control pad. The wave mode sometimes refuses to spawn enemies and there are the odd pauses during gameplay that are unexplained, also the fact you can get lost behind scenary never to be seen. The controls are limited and it is mostly about spamming the buttons to knock someone out, and then lob them out of the arena. And let's be honest here, the controls are unweildy to say the least. Admittedly you do get better through-trial and error and by doing a bit of research, but dear lord is it unpredictable to say the least.\n\nI realise it's early acess and I wish I could bring myself to dedicate more time to it, but whenever me and friends come back to give this game a go there are silly issues that stop us enjoying it, and it never seems to be evolving after all this time. This game has one trick up it's sleeve and that trick is getting old already.\n\nTo summarise: A fun idea that is great for a while but flawed in its execution. I hope it grows into something more substantial and gets the polish it deserves. I live in hope.\n","January 15","false","1.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"
