The game certainly has a great deal of potential, and brings together some interesting and innovative gameplay ideas.\n\nNow let’s talk about the cold vacuous reality of this game and its current state. It’s been in development for YEARS, and seems of have made very little progress on many of the core features beyond basic pick-and-place ship layout, a shallow/buggy market system, and a badly designed “ship simulation game.\nIt’s an unbalanced and buggy mess, with a “Full Techtree” victory achievable in just a few hours of gameplay (once you master the crude and mindnumbly repetitive gameplay tasks). I encountered countless errors and bugs simply through the course of playing the tutorial and several sandbox games.\nThere is no strategy, virtually no resource management, and limited room for creativity, and zero re-playability. The techtree is little more than a halfassed speedbump – in virtually every situation the next technology/module is superior to its predecessor (in some cases comically superior re: Storage Modules)\n\nYou will likely spend 70% of your playtime in the “crew training” module (Since each new ship design requires you to play through over a dozen repetitive tasks), it seems to be the most fleshed out portion of the game. Here you will find such exciting features as:\n- Zero AI for your crew, and virtually no automation.\n- A Buggy and challenged interface\n- Hours of frustration.\n\nSadly, that does not instill confidence in the team’s capacity to deliver a good game.\n","May 2","false","27.8"," 72 of 93 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","72","93","2","4"

This part of the game isn't very wide in scope yet, but it provides a solid base for the rest of the gameplay. Clients post a call for bids for ship designs with specific requirements (cargo, military, racing, etc) and you'll be able to gain money if you get awarded the contract, allowing you to research new technology and take on more advanced designs. The game doesn't really allow you to use your ships yet, only test them (more on that later) and sell the design, but apparently that's in the works.\n\nThe second part is the ship designing phase, where you fill pre-constructed fuselages with the internals of the ship. You'll need to implement the required capabilities of your ship, while also balancing crew requirements, support systems (power, cooling, and life support) and strategic placement of all of them for when you'll actually use the ship. This part of the game is already quite fleshed out and I look forward to seeing how it will be expanded in the future.\n\nNow, the contracts also specify a requirement for the performance of the ship, and the crew management part allows you to test it. Using a series of missions, you will use your crew (the amount and speciality dependant on how you designed your ship) to manage the internal battle inside your ship, including hull damage, fires, techical malfunctions and hostile invaders. This part of the game plays a bit like FTL, and while this game has more depth than FTL in the battle damage repair side of the game, it's not quite as elegant due to the somewhat clunky interface...\n\n... which brings me to my biggest critisism of the game: the interface. Though everything is functional, it is just that. Now of course this is a very early version of the game and everything is still due for improvement, but the way the text looks and scales on larger resolutions, the somewhat unresponsive crew selection and command and the general aesthetic of the UI make it look like the game was developed in the early 2000's. I do hope the developer considers a facelift for the interface.\n\nThe gameplay, however, is great. I backed this game in its crowdfunding campaign back in 2012, and it's great to see it taking shape like this. Starship Corporation scratches a very specific itch for me, even in this age where computer spaceships are appearing everywhere again.","May 1","true","7.5"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","15","15","0","0"

It was just added to early access so clearly there's a lot more development to be done. The core of this game is laying out floorplans for space ships. You need to consider not only cost and avoiding wasted space, but also where rooms are in relation to one another, and how defendable the ship is from various threats. Once you finish a blueprint, you switch to a mode where you test your ship in various scenarios in order to earn a score. A higher score increases your ship's value on the market.\n\nAt the time of this writing, the game doesn't yet have travel between systems, so you might say the meta game isn't in yet. There are fourteen hulls you can play around with, a lot of rooms to research, and the testing scenarios all work well. The game is not optimized at all yet so expect long loading times, as well as a long time to exit the game.

The game takes a long time to load, but plays very smoothly once that hurdle is passed.

Anyways, in its current build, which I believe is 0.8.9 alpha, it's pretty good. The concept itself is VERY interesting to me, but sadly, it does have it's bugs and crashes. Mostly when using a hotkey like Z to delete or bring back something I deleted or when I'm trying to go on to the next step on making my ship/selling it.\n\nHowever, I do believe this game can turn out like some other alpha games I know and really shine, hopefully because the devs are very into this and are willing to make this game better for the community who wants to play this game, with its good concept and a good experience, without having the bugs and all. Either way, for now, this is getting a thumbs up, because I believe that this game still has potential.\n\nP.S.

So far I haven´t had a single crash and I have fullfilled my first contract without major issues. Only bug I had so far was that during one mission a crew member got stuck on an airlock, that´s it.\n\nThe game itself isn´t fast paced strategy or a real tycoon simulator (at least not yet). It´s just pick a contract, which demands a certain type of ship. For example a freighter that can load 3000 tons and handle a small boarding. Then you choose a fuselage and place the rooms you have researched on it while trying to balance things like electricity, crew size and so on while also keepign in mind that for example exhaust and loading doors can be places where boarding takes place. So do not place the bridge, the target of every boarding crew, right beside those, for example. There are many things to consider.\n\nThen you control the crew through a varity of simulations, like the above mentioned boardings or a meteor storm or a fire in the enine room etc. The better your ship handles those the better the rating, and the more money oyu can ask for it. Of course you could also create a shity ship which barely has all the rooms it needs and places it´s crew in mortal danger, but only costs half as much as the other company? There are different tactics here.\n\nNote that every ship can try every crew simulation, but a lot of ships won´t and don´t need to handle all these. Your 3000t frighter with a crew of 10  for example doesn´t have to win a boarding manouver by 25 special forces soldiers. Your contractor won´t expect it anyway.\n\nSo as oyu can see there is a lot of thought involved here, so for the love of god: Don´t buy this game and drag the ratings down if you can´t handle that. The game is not too hard (in fact it´s gotten easier since the first demo from a few years back on desura).\n\nWhich brings me to my final point: The game is already in development for several years, so while it´s unlikely that it will be abandoned at this point, it´s also unlikely that it will leap forwards in huge steps I think. So if you want to support the developer, buy it, it´s worth it I think, but don´t expect the finished game next month or so.","May 2","true","6.8"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

It's more a thumbs-up for the developer so that they carry on.\nBut the game is really in an alpha state so I wouldn't recommend buying now, you will see a large chunk of cons but they didn't stop me from playing, it's just that if you don't have time or curiosity to deal with them, you should wait for a later version of the game.\n\nPick a hull, build the rooms of your ship and stress it under specific use cases like firestorm, piratery, or simple normal operation.\nSell your creation in the galaxy by answering speficic requests from companies.\nResearch new modules for new features.\nThe game content is quite complete right now. Or at least sufficiently large anough to make the game interesting to play.\nAll the situations are playable, a lot of different rooms to research, a whole galaxy with tons of systems where you can build an office and start answering specific needs and a final mission.\n\nI'm sure most of the cons will be corrected at some point but here they are\nThe cons :\n- You don't get much personal satisfaction until you've finalised a complete ship and its tests so, unlike most other game, you will be frustrated of doing and doing again until you make the perfect ship and go through the numerous tests. So I guess it's lacking simple objectives to start with and get a hold of the game. Like a non manned ship for instance or a single seater fighter...\n- Building your ship can be a pain due to corrifor management. I think there should be a free draw corridor system. Though, it works...\n- Very bugged at the moment, but well, it's an alpha, lots of in game error pops or crashes but its playable anyway.\n- I find the time you spend on just planning the route of your crew to optimize necessary maintenances very painful. Your team is slow, maintenance stats go down very quickly, difficult to synchronise all of them when they have to meet back in the same room cause this room needs 4 crew to maintain and so on. This game should not be a patrol tycoon :-)\n- I was kinda confused by the breaches. Still haven't figured out how to not kill the crew while attempting rushed repair  or not having the rest of the crew die with lack of oxygen while you suit up or loosing a whole area of the ship by sealing it off with little expectation to retrieve it some day.\n- Lack of indicators and bars so that you understand the status of the rooms in one glimpse.\n- Couldn't find a way to make the crew escape in the emergency evacuation system\n- Interface is annoying, like when you want to go to previous menu ingame, you'd prefer starting over from the 1st menu cause it's clumsy. Or not really intuitive. You often wonder where to click at the start.\n- Tutorial is just enough for the Alpha, Still images. It needs to be improved for the final verison. Though without it I would have never figured out how to maintain rooms in the ship...\n- If anything happens on your ship, then your technicians go away to deal with the problem and all your maintenances get disrupted = chaos. Yes, you can have an army of technicians though to deal with that but not really efficient.\n- Sounds need to be balanced or reviewed. Like the hard breath when soemone is about to die. And it's even worse when ALL your crew is about to die... Just die quietly please, don't overload my ears.\n\nYour ship has a flaw ? You need to change the plan ? Awww, tooo bad, you'll have to start all the tests over even if you add a screw in the captain chair. So, piece of advice, think ahead  and assume the consequences. Maybe this flawed design version of a ship can be sold at good price anyway !\n\nTo conclude, you'll probably wonder why a thumbs up with so many things to correct! Well, simple, I don't know any game that puts you in this "design and test" situation where you honestly feel like you're a ship manufacturer with the difficulties it brings.\nIt's just missing the production line setup in the factory ;-) joking\n\nLot of work ahead though !","May 2","true","5.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I see it more as a challenge in efficiency with almost puzzle-like character, where you can spend hours\ndesigning ships, testing them on missions, going back to optimize, and finally either keep them or sell them off. The last part is not what attracted me to the game in the first place and for me it's more there to keep the challenges coming, so maybe that's why I'm not as bothered that it is the least fleshed-out aspect of the game. In that sense it reminds me a little of campaigns in city-building games, where you're usually tasked with fulfilling a specific set of requirements instead of sandboxing freely. I hope for the next release that the developer's focus will be on more of these "chapters" (aka different types of contracts) and more components for the tech tree.","May 4","true","8.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

In large ships with many separated rooms even in the same levels, the crews don't move well to the designation. I have to click near by stairs and rooms manually. If left alone, crews try to move to the same level but to different deck. They sometimes get stuck in locations too.\n2. I don't know why the ship evaluation screen is named as crew management. What you actually do is just application testing of the ship to get SOP, ERS and  HEP scores.\n3. Getting the ship evaluated to earn SOP, ERS and HEP is so much fun for few times. However, if I have to redo it over and over for little design improvements, it is also frustrating. Hope there is an AI doing it automatically.

Whilst i have only played just over 3 hours, that was in a single session where i tested out as many things as possible. The game itself is clearly unfinished, but it is still very playable.\n\nThe tutorial whilst clunky, is easy to follow and explains the important aspects of the game. I feel further explenation should have been done in certain areas such as having spare staff on hand to assist with dealing with situations onboard. Yes the AI is stupid in that it isnt very autonomous, but having had the game patched to increase the AI potential just last night, makes me think that things will improve.\n\nThere are other aspects of the game that need improvment but again this is early access and you should expect that. Is it worth the price, maybe. I think that the £14.99 i paid was at the highest end of what i would willingly pay for this game in its current state. Having siad that the deveolopers have indicated that at time of writing there is no plans to increase the cost, so we will see if the final version makes this a more attractive price.\n\nOverall it isnt a bad game, yes it has issues but seems to be actively supported by the devs who after the first month of release have released a patch which fixes a reasonable amount of stuff. They have listened to feedback and seem to be making steps in the right direction. Having been on both sides of a early access backing (with successful and abandoned projects) I would reccomend this game to anyone with the a patient attitude and an open mind.

It's very, very rough.\n\nThat said, if you can deal with EA shenanigans, this game has wonderful potential.\n\nTo start, you're limited to one solar system (which limits your selection of ship contracts) and design-type contracts (you're contracted to design a ship, building ships is not currently in the game).\n\nYou pick and choose what contracts you want to fulfill, and then you get down to the fun part.  Depending on what you currently have researched (there's a half decent tech "tree" in the game already, each part type has tiers that you unlock), you can start placing modules around a fuselage.  Modules are connected via hatches and corridors (that you add), and you have to wire and plumb the various power/fuel/oxygen/water lines around the ship.  The types of modules you add will determine the specs of the ship, which must meet or exceed the customer requirements.\n\nThen, you get to simulate how well your ship will do.  There are a bunch of scenarios you run your ship through to give it ratings, which increase the price you can sell it for.  Again, the contract his a minimum rating your ship needs before you can bid with it.\n\nThen, you have to bid on the contract, and the AI can undercut you.  Once you win the contract, you transfer the design and get paid.\n\nI thought I would care more about ship design and less about the simulations and ratings, but I find myself rerunning the sims trying to get better scores.  It's addicting!\n\nThis review was of the first EA-release; I will try to update as patches come out.\n\nEDIT: For those of you marking this as non-helpful, please leave a comment so I can address your concerns.","April 30","true","9.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Currently there are only design contracts and you can perform research to get larger more efficient modules or completely new ones.\n\nIn contrast to most other ship design games, this has a focus on civil vessels and is basicly a starship manufactor tycoon. You will be able to also design military vessels in the future, but no weapons are currently available. The contracts have specific requirements, such as rooms that need to be present (the game tells you if you have not yet researched them), stats, maximum crew, construction budget and if a specific fuselage (hull) should be used. The contract can also require a minimum of the three major ratings SOP, ERS and HES, exceeding these adds to the value of the design compared to the competitors.\n\nExample on a contract:\ncontract for light cargo ship\nRooms required: none\n\nFuselage: not specified (any can be used)\nBudget Limit: 19k Btc (yes bitcoins are the currency of the game)\nFreight Capacity: 1100 tons\nFuel Capacity: 50 tons\nMax. Crew Count: 12\nRange: 94 lightyears\nMission duration: 2.00 months (you need enough air and water capacity to travel for that duration)\nSpeed: 1.00 kc\n\nRatings: Design 60, SOP 13, ERS 31 and HEP 0\n\n\nWhen selecting a contract you can see a list of your current designs and a percentage for how close they are to fulfilling that contract. You can also save a contract to keep a list of the ones you're interested in. When designing a ship you can "link" it to a saved contract and easily see how close the design is to fulfilling the contract. You can also make a custom requirements if you want to make a design that fulfills multiple contracts. The design aspect is the core of the game and the area that feels the most complete. Once you start connecting powerlines, cooling lines, fuel lines, air lines and water lines the game start to lag, so could use some optimization.\n\nAfter finishing a design you save it as a ship class. This ship class then have to be rated doing crew simulations. This is the area that has been criticized the most. I agree that it could use some improvements, but your experience also depends on how well the infrastructure is designed. For SOP (normal operations) you should be able to set up patrol rutes and just got make a sandwitch or something. If you can't, then you don't have enough crew to support the current design. You can "fix" this by adding more crew quarters or improve the infrastructure of the design so it is faster for the current crew to move around. The game could do a better job of explaining maintanence and patrols in the tutorial and how to fix hull breaches. A higher speed setting than x2 normal speed would also be very welcome as it can become a bit repetive. You can pause during the crew simulation by pressing P, so you don't have to worry about APM and such in the emergency tests.\n\nI think the game has a sound fundation. It still has a way to go in both content, optimization and polish, but that is to be expected as a newly released early access title. The design phase is where it currently shines the most and if you enjoy tinkering with designs (spending 1-1.5 hours per design on the smaller fuselages). Fuselages currently vary from 1037 m^2 to 4480 m^2 and with various number of decks (highest I have seen is 5 decks). The currently largest fuselage is under the category military small, with military medium and military large not having any right now.","May 6","true","23.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

My idea of heaven!\n\nSo does it deliver? In short yes, on the design part anyway. Making a ship to fit the customers requirements is a challenge but not overally complex. Each requirement is basically a room (or rooms), so for example cargo bays, engine rooms etc. But these come with their own requirements, engines need fuel so add a fuel tank "room", but depending on the range requirements you might need more than 1 fuel tank. Engines and other system require cooling, so add enough cooling "rooms" to provide sufficent cooling so the ship doesn't over heat. There are enough details to provide a idea of realisim, eg cooling rooms need venting hatches to space so you have to plan accordingly. Then all this need joining up with corridors and fuel/cooling lines etc. All this is supported by a resource tree to allow you to perform R&D to build better systems and bigger ships.\n\nOnce you have built the ship it's time for it's shake down test run. It's not obvious if this is supposed to be a simulated test run or you've actually built a prototype ship and it's in space. But either way this is where the fun disappears from the game.\n\nIt's micro-management in it's most anally retentive form. The ship is populated with crew such as pilots, engineers and medicial staff and at this point you have to tell them how to do their job. I seriously HATE games which do this. Starship Corp has gone to such lengths to make a semi-realistic sitution of designing a ship but then it wants to tell a crew how to do it's job? "Hey engineers, you have to go to all these rooms to perform routine maintence" and when it's fixed you have to tell them again, or if you want to get smart then add a round robin path for them to wander and fix stuff.\n\n"Hey engineers? If you don't fix these rooms you'll all die", would anyone just sit about waiting for death without being given an order? Add a Chief Engineer to automatically delegate this crap too. Same goes for the pilots, you have to tell them to visit the computer core, because apparently pilots need to do this as part of their job. Well if it's part of their job then why do I have to tell them? I'm a Starship designer not a Captain or Team Leader! Did Thomas Andrews (designer of the Titanic) run about telling the crew when and where to be and what to do when they got there? Doubtful...\n\nOverall it's a great concept and the design part is wonderfull and at this early part of development it can only get better. It's however let down by click happy micro-management test flight phase which in comparison to the rest of the game looks like is was a design after thought.","May 7","true","2.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

What?), and as a third element, an overtaxing but underwhelming ship simulator.\n\nPeople have compared it to FTL, but it's more like if you had to constantly move your crew around every room for ten minutes per sector in FTL or your ship explodes before it can even do the first jump. And your crew never shuts up when you're telling it to do this. If that sounds like a great idea, you might just be the target market for this game.\n\nAnyway, the main, crippling problem with this game is that after you've picked a contract and designed a blueprint suitable for its requirement, if you change your ship designs even a little bit (even literally rearranging a few doors and readjusting the wiring so they work right), you have to go through the stressful-yet-tedious process of recertifying the ship, which is a ten minute  simulation of the ship running (real time, you can pause and slow down).\n\nNow you could theoretically turn the speed up, but you have to direct your crew to maintain your vessel, and even on a tiny seven-man ship (the smallest possible), that requires near-constant input because there's no automation whatsoever. And if anything goes wrong eight or nine minutes into the process, you really have to start again because otherwise your rating for how well the ship performs gets tanked, and you need a certain rating for your ship to get bought.\n\nUntil you've done that, you also can't access the more theoretically enjoyable parts of testing the ship, where you try to prove it's safe in a series of emergency situations. But too many of these have the same patience-testing ten minute time limit, and if you discover that there's some kind of flaw in your design when it comes to dealing with one problem or another, welp, guess you have to do the original certification all over again, plus everything else.\n\nOh and incidentally you still have to maintain the ship in the ten minute emergency certifications, just like the "sit here and make sure the ship doesn't break down by clicking and listening to radio barks a lot" mode. Brill.\n\n\n\nNow in a game called Detroit from 1994, you had to do something like this too. They've somewhat similar games, in fact. Same big map screen with (eventually for this project) different markets, and your factories and labs, with a designer and a related test function.\n\nBig difference between this game and Detroit is that in Detroit, it doesn't take three f*cking hours to not quite be able to sell your first car, because although you tuned your gear ratios and connected up your brake fluid just so, you didn't optimally design your automobile to sustain an attack by tommy gun wielding gangsters that you as a CEO have to survive for nearly a quarter of an hour, so it's back to the drawing board (and then test centre... again...).\n\nI might actually like this game if they started excising big parts of what it currently is. But that's not the usual trajectory for an EA project, so I can't recommend it in good faith. Sorry, boys.","May 2","false","3.8"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","0"

Build ship\n2.) Test it\n3.) Sell it\n\nMost of your time will be spent testing the ships. It didn't take long before I began to feel like I was 'working' instead of 'playing'. you basically set up "routes" for your repair guys to "maintain" the different pieces in your ships.\nEach part in your ship has a certain time frame they must be visited by a repair guy before it starts to take damage.\nFelt like I bought a pacman game.\nAfter buying the game, I repeatedly saw demands where people were asking for AI (artificial intelligence) to take care of ship testing for you.\n\nThere were aspects such a energy, heat, fuel, oxygen, water, and storage on your ship, but I didn't feel as if there was much more strategy with placement of those ship parts outside of making an efficient route for your crew to run around and maintain parts.\n\nThe "Sell" part of the game where you sell your ships might as well been something put together in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. The criteria for who a customer choses as the contractor for their bid did not go into details of anything I would assume should be part of the decision making process. Lowest bidder was the only rationale I saw. Not.... your ship is more expensive, but it has more storage and is more durable than the other ships.... or, your ship is 1% more expensive, but has military capabilities, whereas the others don't.\n\nThe Galactic Civilizations III game I already have gave a much more gratifying ship building experience than this game does, and that wasn't even the sole purpose of that game. Galactice Civ 3 didn't go into the depth of as many ship parts as this game includes, but at least I got to fly my ships around and watch them wreak havok on my enemies.

The tutorial voice is too quiet to hear, though the text was fine to guide,\n\nVery complicated design process, which is fun enough but I found a lot of the overlay hard to read (despite playing on a 50 inch screen) and it seems there's just too much going on at once. Too much clikcing in and out of menus. Some simplification much needed.\n\nAs a concept, I love it and will be watching closely but for my first play I got a bit bored while building the tutorial ship and will likely leave it for now.\n\nEDIT/UPDATE:\nI felt I was being a little harsh so I jumped back in and this time I built a survey ship. It was a struggle to fit eveything in but I was proud of my creation. It came to testing and I found that despite meeting the crew requirements I was immediately penalised for not having more. Clearly something I need to keep in mind for later. I began "standard operating procedure" and sat for 10 minutes just making sure nothing broke down. I couldn't find anything to get the crew to perform tasks automatically, which would have really helped. I got a pretty poor score despite keeping the ship in perfect condition. This vexed me.\n\nThen when the test was completed I found out there were loads of other tests to do, presumably each taking another 10 minutes. I decided I did not have time for that.\n\nI'll likely pop on again but I'm finding the testing system a little overwhelming at the moment, as though it could perhaps all be done automatically and a score given. It's not like I'm going to go on every ship I sell to micromanage every situation, is it? Maybe this just isn't a game mechanic I enjoy, others may feel differenty.\n\nVerdict: I love the challenging aspect of building the ship itself, it's great fun. The ship testing was a daunting prospect and I stopped before doing more. These are just my thoughts on beginning gameplay but at the moment I'm thinking "maybe later".","April 30","false","1.6"," 8 of 21 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","8","21","0","0"

The gameplay is therefore research components, accept design contracts, design appropriate ships, test ships, sell ship designs.  That's already quite a lot of fun and can be challenging = it's one thing to be able to fit everything required by a contract into a specific hull, quite another to tear around fixing all the things that go wrong while being bombarded by asteroids for 10 minutes.\n\nDespite being Early Access I have found no serious issues and just one repeatable glitch,  Oddly enough, the one crash I had was while quitting the game, which in any case seems to take a long time.  The one glitch is that during ship design the room-outline is sometimes-often 'lost' - fixed by clicking into and back out of one of the pipe-laying overlays.  There is a mechanic for setting repeating 'patrol' routes for crew members but no way to queue actions just to be carried out once.  Adding this would be the best gameplay improvement.  Nevertheless, already a lot of fun as it stands and can only get better :-)","May 6","true","93.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It still has lots of bugs... but the game breakers in the basic functionality are gone... now I am able to reliably design a ship and save it, and run the various crew simulations on it. Does it still take a long time to load?  Yes... but I don't care as much now that the game doesn't crash nearly as often.\n\nThere will be more bugs found (I have an unfinished bug report to do after writing this review), but the developer fixes them quickly. I'll be thrilled when he adds new content, but the ship design and simulation content is there... and it's good, and it's fun.\n\nSome people have complained about having to micromanage the crew in the simulation part (specifically the routine operations simulation)... I don't find this is the case. When the simulation starts, I pause it and give orders to the crew (including a maintenance tour for the technicians)... the crew pretty reliably goes about doing those orders, so as long as you didn't miss something in the initial orders, you are good. I pretty much give the orders, unpause it at 2x speed, and then just keep an eye on it for anything I missed.\n\n\n\nI am keeping my initial review below.\n\n----\n\nThis game has unbelievable potential... it's everything I've wanted in games where I design my own starship... I've dreamt about being able to design my own power routing, cooling systems, etc., and route them how I want to... this lets you do all of that.\n\nThe problem is that the game is horribly buggy still... you first notice this when you load it... it takes 2-3 minutes at least to load. This is way too long of a time to wait around waiting for a game to load. Then, when I tried to run the tutorial, I got about 2/3 of the way through the ship design process, and the tutorial tried to have me save the game. Well, I did it, but then the interface went away and a debug console message came up and poof... the last hour disappeared because the auto-save didn't work, and the save ship dialog locked up the game.\n\nThen, I tried going directly to the next stage of the tutorial... it immediately crashed to desktop with another debug message.\n\nI really want to love this game, and I hope that these issues get resolved in a timely manner... I will be back, but I can't recommend it for anybody in its current state of development.","May 1","true","16.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

One thing that will really need to be done is fixing pathing for technicians when you're switching floors. They seem to get confused by any number of things and overall ruin the crew managment part. Would also like to see a timer for "Permenant" maintenence rooms to get a rough idea of how long i can safely run that room with less staff should say 4 other rooms need repairs at once..","June 2","false","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
