AI Wars is clearly a great game, but somehow it's this one that I keep coming back to.\n\nBionic Dues is Arcen's take on a "roguelike," but of course in proper Arcen style it is totally unique.\n\nBasically, it has a lot in common with a proper roguelike: you guide your characters through a series of procedurally generated dungeons. But there are a *lot* of interesting twists:\n\n- You have 4 characters, (which are actually some sort of mecha exoskeleton?) in any combination of "classes," but can only use one at a time, and it takes a turn to swap them out.\n\n- Loot and inventory customizaton is of primary importance. Each bot has *tons* of inventory slots, in several categories, and each class is different. Carefully poring over the hundreds of components you find, and optimizing their arrangement on each robot chassis, balancing your overall strategy, is the part of the game that I find utterly addictive. (It feels a lot like ship design in Gratuitous Space Battles, another of my favorites.)\n\n- There is a sort of top-level strategy layer linking the dungeons. In between runs, you re-arrange robot parts, and choose your next raid target based on likely risk/rewards and your overall position in the map, with a global counter ticking down to a final level full of particularly nasty enemies.\n\n- Understanding enemy AI and abilties is really important. There are a lot of enemy bot types, with simply-defined behaviors that are nevertheless complex in their interactions, and they appear in randomized combinations that can really change the way you approch a given dungeon.\n\n- The game can be played with a number of different difficulty options, and core gameplay modifiers like the addition of permadeath, ironman mode, and time-limits on turns. This really allows you to tweak the game to your liking; you can choose to allow save-scumming, seeking the perfect run, or you can make it a much more tense and chaotic affair.\n\nOne thing that needs mentioning: a lot of the art assets are just awful-looking, especially on the strategy and inventory-management screens. To enjoy the game, you will have to be able to get over this, and see the item illustrations as purely functional conveyors of data. This works fine for me, but I'm sure it turns a lot of people off. Thankfully, I think the dungeon art is pretty nice-looking.\n\nFrankly, I also found the music and voices to be awful (though a lot of the sound design itself is pretty nice,) and I tend just turn it off and listen to my own music.\n\nDespite all the ugly warts, I keep coming back to this one. If you like procedural turn-based dungeon crawling, and find yourself spending a lot of enjoyable time comparing stuff on inventory screens, this might be a good one for you.\n\nI also like that it lends itself well to short play sessions; you can pop in for a quick dungeon or a bit of stat-crunching without feeling too committed. It's also a good game to have running in the background while you're doing something else, taking a turn now and then.\n\n\nAll in all, this is a deep little game that's well worth its price tag - at the time of this writing, it's available at the ridiculous sale price of $1.99, and no roguelike fan should miss it.","November 3, 2014","true","43.9"," 56 of 61 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","56","61","0","0"

With no introduction, you're shown a screen with the portraits of four exos (your remote-controlled mechs) and a pilot, and are asked to select your team for the rest of the game. You can only take four of six exos with you; and can only select one pilot of, again, six. Each exo is armed differently, though you're only given a small description of their capabilities on a hovering text box. The same goes for the pilots: each their own brief backstory, and a special ability that affects the performance of the team. "+50% to all propulsion stats—" "A Mark-4 part will have stats like a Mark-6—" "He was able to sneak into the Bahamut Device installations—" But you've been given no story and have no idea what the gameplay is like yet. What's a Mark-6? What does the propulsion stat do? What's a Bahamut Device? None of this has any context, so you're just guessing at what might make an effective team and hoping for the best. If you later don't like your choices — well, tough; you're stuck with it.\n\nUpon selecting your team, you're dumped into a map screen and given a one-page briefing of the situation and your mission. It's then explained that the city is under attack by a robot rebellion, and as the sole remaining pilot, it's up to you to prevent annihilation. That's the extent of your story. No characters are introduced, your pilot is never addressed by name, and the voiceover guy doesn't even explain who he is. As no real world-building is done, and your choice of pilot has no effect on the extremely-minimal story, it makes the whole process of choosing a pilot superfluous. Who cares what their names are, what they look like, or what very brief backstory they each have when it doesn't change anything in the campaign and is never addressed again? "Choose your pilot" could have easily been "choose your buff," then addressed the player, themselves, as the pilot of the exos.\n\nPressing OK clears the introductory text, and then several more bulletpoints of information are thrown on screen at once, explaining several basic gameplay mechanics before they're necessary. You can go straight to a mission, but the screen is flanked by icons of your exos and enemy bots, with a big green arrow reading "Customize" pointing to your team. Clicking on that gives you another text box of info, and behind it, way more info as you're shown the stats of each exo and every item in your inventory. This was the biggest and most repeated problem encountered: just way too much disorganized information at once, often without context. Each exo has 14 base stats to keep track of, and then as many as five weapons with up to 23 more stats, determined by equipping items to a potential 30 inventory slots.\n\nGet used to the customization screen; with up to 50 missions in the campaign, you'll be spending a lot of time here between fights. This does allow you to specialize each exo with careful delegation of items and theory-crafting, but eventually I got tired of sinking so much time into figuring out exactly which item would be best-equipped where and on which exo, with so many possibilities and little nuances, that I skipped it unless I picked up something that was an obviously big upgrade. This may have been easier with better information management, but everything in this game comes as a wall of text in the same typeface. There's very little colour differentiation, and absolutely no graphics or icons used for quick identification. I started skipping the customization, because it wasn't fun; it felt like homework. However, you can only neglect dedicating yourself to this process so much, as the enemy forces get stronger with every mission. Do it, or eventually you will be outclassed.\n\nSee how much information is written here so far? We haven't even gotten to the first mission yet. Each mission is represented on the map by a different icon branching outwards from your headquarters. You have to complete them in succession to explore the city, until the final battle on the fiftieth day. Bionic Dues outright tells you that the final battle is on day 50, which is unsuspenseful. Your basic objective is to grind through the missions, upgrading your exos with loot and potentially weakening the enemy forces in preparation for one final and massive battle of attrition. If you mess up enough along the way, you can reach that final day, fail the battle, and lose the whole campaign.\n\nThe battles are turn-based. Your team has to explore a randomly-generated, grid-based battlefield, eliminating enemy robots and potentially destroying certain objectives along the way. All four exos move together on the same grid point, like an old RPG party. Only one of them is active at a time, and that will be the one who can fight and take damage. Moving, firing, using a special ability, or switching between exos takes one turn. Most of the enemies will remain inactive until you aggro them, and then they'll each take their turn after you make your move. They're not particularly challenging; most bots can be dispatched easily by being outranged or lead into traps. However, if you're not tactical, there are times where you can find yourself flanked, cornered, and overwhelmed. You can lose one of your exos in an instant with a poor choice of moves. So what happens then? Can you repair the exo, or is there some sort of penalty? Do you need to replace it, or go through the rest of the campaign with only three on your team? The game never explains, beyond that you'll receive one less piece of loot at the end of the mission.\n\nThe way each battle plays out varies depending on the type of mission, represented by the icon on the map screen. For example, some turn all destructable objects into powerful explosives, some have hostages that must be protected, and some power up every exo and bot to perform one-hit kills. This adds a little gameplay variety. However, the battlefields, themselves, are visually very bland and repetitive. They all take place indoors, and the scenery doesn't change from one part of the city to the other. Their dark grey floor colouring offers low contrast from the black, unnavigable negative space, sometimes making it hard to distinguish where you can and can't move your exos.\n\nOnce you complete your objective, you have to navigate to the exit of the level. While this does give a chance to explore and pick up any missed loot, this is often dull, as the main objective and the exit aren't necessarily going to be placed nearby each other. Often you'll find yourself navigating empty corridors as you search for the way out, which may not be easy to find. The exit isn't an actual physical exit from the battlespace, but a circle on one of the tiles, which may be hard to spot at times when it's in the fog-of-war shadow. Poor contrast plays an issue here again. Making it to the exit, in itself, is anticlimactic. You'll be immediately dumped back to the map screen, with no victory fanfare or continuation of a story.\n\nOnce you've done that, go spend a while calculating how to best upgrade your exos, then repeat the process 48 more times to make it to the final battle. There's no build-up to this moment — it's treated the same as every other mission. The final battle is an endurance run, pitting your four exos against the remanants of the enemy bot army, or as many as can fit in the map at once. It's not harder, just longer. And once you win, your reward? A "congratulations" text box. Then you just sit on the map screen. That's it.\n\nWhile the basics are here, Bionic Dues falls short, still having massive room for improvement in its gameplay and presentation. Not recommended.","June 22, 2014","false","24.1"," 121 of 168 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","121","168","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteswart/recommended/238910/","Whiteswart","Whiteswart","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteswart/","1424 products in account","Basically, Bionic Dues is a rogue-like mix of rpg/strategy dungeon crawler with hi-tech setting, where you fighting ever growing hordes of killing droids with your own droid. War of the machines, basic "save the humanity from annihilation" stuff - that's all you'll ever catch about story. You can think of it as of another small thing for touchpads, but no, it's not that simple. Actually, it is like an iceberg, where major part of the game is hiding beneath the surface. And yeah, if you're looking for light walk with painless achievements - that's a very wrong game for you! While its quite easy to catch an opening pattern, farther you go - more skill and luck you need. On Every Turn.\n\nNow, the real game is where its mechanics. You have dozens of basic options like which droid class do you prefer, what strategy will be the best with grading that given droid, and how do you planning to save the world? Destroying every enemy bot in the reach from the start, when they are still weak? Or just cutting their numbers by destroying their factories and supplies while building up your muscles for the final battle? Dozens of basic strategic options - and thousands choices on tactics. Will you prefer to raise power of single shot or ammo capacity? Range of sight or splash effect for your rockets? Stealth and traps or brute force and assault?\nCloser to the end of each match you'll get enough mods for your droid to make him an ultimate death machine of choice. And still you'll be vulnerable, remarkably outnumbered and outgunned in every mission. So you have to consider many steps forward. Always. And that's why I'm satisfied with that "small looking, gross bearing" tactical game.\n\nThere are minuses, of course:\n\n- very basic visual part. No, it is not XCom or Jagged Alliance with destroyable 3d environment, that's top-down view rogue-like indie project. Surely not for DOTA kids who are filling about half of Steam auditory.\n\n- while it's quite easy to get along with, if you are in any way familiar with rogue-like games... finishing Bionic Dues even once can be very challenging and sometimes boring.\n\n- if you're an achievement hunter, that game is a disaster, for to make complete of this game, you'll need to invest Hundredz of Hourz. Not dozens, but hundreds hours of your precious time. And there will be no detailed video guides, like for the Civilization, "how to prosper on Deity". To get all 220 achievements, you'll need to master all combinations of battle classes, beating the game about 20-30 times in average. And except diversity of tactics related to these classes, the rest will be repeated again. And again. And again...\n\n- inventory, the part of the Bionic Dues, which makes it RPG-like, by selecting a combination of two dozens of attributes installed on your war machine... that's exactly the most boring part in the whole game. In the start, where you have about 5 spare parts, it's ok. But after 10-15 missions you'll be buried with dozens and even hundreds of items, from which you need to choose from. So many players get stacked and bored at this point! But after 20-30 hours of play you'll overcome it, hopefully. Managing one droid is much easier than all 4, and real challenge is where you making through with just one robot, not a squad of them.\n\nPluses are less:\n\n- never ending challenge and need to think much forward\n\n- many different strategies, which always should be adapted to every mission\n\n- fantastic music! to the point where I can start a game not for playing, but just to hear that ambient again. Starting song is gorgeous! I can listen to it over and over again, for hours\n\nOverall, I would recommend Bionic Dues to all fans of turn-based tactical games and I would NOT recommend it for achievement hunters and casual players. This game may looks nice and cosy, easy like the most of the games for touch screens... But in fact it is a very engaging time-killer.\n\n7.5/10 saved cities","August 13, 2015","true","75.6"," 57 of 69 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","57","69","2","6"

Bionic Dues is a turn-based strategic roguelike where you control four exos (remotely piloted mechs, basically), only one at a time but hot swappable, through a variety of missions towards a final showdown with the enemy robot force. It shines in all the right areas: intelligent randomization, loot, equipment options, a variety of different mission types, lots of different weapon types, exo specializations and commander perks, plus a bunch of achievements. Individual missions are typically pretty short (5-10 minutes tops), so it can be played in short bursts if desired. I've already sunk a ton of time into this, with much more on the horizon.

The difficulty seemed all over the place, there were a lot of numbers and stats everywhere, and things were confusing. But, if you stay on and keep playing, you eventually start to get a hang of it. There is a bit of a learning curve here, but the game has a very nice tactical depth to it and can be loads of fun.\n\nUpon starting a new game, you get to select your preferred pilot and 4 mechs/exosuits. Each pilot has a bonus perk of some sort, and each mech has its own strengths and weaknesses, some being more offensively based, others more to do with support stuff, like hacking and stealth. So it's up to you to pick your preferred team.\n\nThe campaign itself has a simple concept - a robot army is going to attack your HQ in 50 days. Do whatever you can to prepare yourself for this attack. Each mission you do in the city counts as a day. You can go for missions where you find shiny new gear for your mechs to make them stronger, or you can go for missions which weaken the enemy and slow their expansion. The best thing is, you can see on a side of a screen the details of what units currently comprise the enemy army, so you can see how it is affected after every mission you do.\n\nThe missions themselves take a form of a randomly-generated dungeon with tile-based movement. You can swap between your mechs at will, but doing so counts as a turn, so you have to be very careful in your advance. It is very easy to make a wrong move and to have several enemies on you at once. Both, your units and enemy units, might feel like glass cannons. You could kill an enemy in 1-2 shots, but so can they! So you have to utilise tactics to outsmart them - use range or perhaps area of effect weapons, or even just pull back and surprise them around the corner. You can even deploy sentry turrets to help you in firefights if you've got any available.\n\nAnd in between missions you can customize your mechs with the loot found. The customization is very rich and detailed. Each mech has several slots where gear can fit in, ranging from weapons, to shields, to propulsion systems. It can feel overwhelming at first because there are a lot of things on the screen, but you do get used to it, and everything in the game has a description if you're unsure what something is.\n\nSpeaking of descriptions, they're fantastic. Everything has an edge of humour in it. When you hover over an enemy, an object, or anything else in-game, you see a bit of funny flavour text about it.\n\nThe music is also amazing. I first got interested in the game when I've heard its main theme, which is very beautiful with great vocals, but even the tracks that play during missions are also great.\n\nI've been enjoying the game so far and started a new campaign already. I would highly suggest to play the first game on an Easy or Casual difficulty level to get familiar with the game. After that, the higher difficulty levels don't seem as bad anymore.\n\nGreat game. Highly recommended for fans of tactics-based games.","December 4, 2015","true","20.2"," 25 of 27 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","25","27","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nanako/recommended/238910/","Nanako","Nanako =^.^=","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nanako/","189 products in account","Bionic dues is a roguelike, and plays pretty similar to standard rogue games. You take an action, then everything else does, repeat untill enemies are dead or an objective is complete. You get four party members that you can switch between at any point (costs an action) but only one of them can be on the field at a time, so you're really always controlling a single hero, not a squad.\n\nFirst it should be said that, like most arcen games, Bionic Dues has amazingly good music. Although they are merely adequate as a game developer, they have the amazing Pablo Vega on staff doing all their music. This is especially noticeable in the hauntingly beautiful title track, The Home That We Once Knew.  A song so brilliant i'd recommend buying this game JUST to hear it, despite its other flaws. It really sets the scene and is a truly amazing first impression, sadly it's mostly downhill from there.\n\nThis game has an unfortunate problem shared by other Arcen titles, in that the game bombards you with information right from the beginning, telling you in pointlessly explicit detail about the final battle you'll eventually have and how to win it. Aside from being overwhelming and working very poorly as a tutorial, this also instantly takes away any sense of novelty or mystery from the game, and you're never really in doubt about what will eventually happen.  The final battle is hyped and foreshadowed repeatedly, and warnings about it are shoved in your face constantly.\n\nAt the beginning you choose four of the six classes, and one of the six available leaders. this is probably intended to encourage replayability, but i didn't really feel any desire to play it again.\n\nAfter every mission your'e rewarded with a tide of loot with witty descriptions that modify lots of stats, and you can equip your party between missions using these parts. Each squad member has 20-30 equipment slots, so you'll spend a lot of time in there tweaking with equipment loadouts, which is kind of fun at first. However after a while of playing, the system starts to feel shallow, as there's a pretty small range of values that can actually be adjusted, and thusly not much room for "builds" or any real modding strategy. You basicalyl want everyone to be reasonably tanky, and all their weapons to be strong enough to 1-shot enemies, with reasonable amounts of range and ammo. this isn't hard to accomplish.\n\nEventually you'll stop caring about most of the loot you get, and just briefly scan the inventory for unusually high values, there's too much of it, and once you've seen one +50% damage mod, you've seen them all. There's no unusual combinations or interesting unique equipment, just ever-increasing generic values, the novelty fades quickly.\n\nEach squad member has a small (preset, non-changeable) selection of weapons, and with certain missions they can get a permanant upgrade which gives them additional weapons and equipment slots (again, preset). These upgrades are nice and add an interesting power spike to things, but there's exactly one for each squad member, and they're no-brainers you'll want to grab asap.\n\n\n***** SPOILERS AHEAD *****\n***** SPOILERS AHEAD *****\n***** SPOILERS AHEAD *****\n\n\nDespite the constant warnings and foreshadowing, and especially the warning that i'd have to hold off a massive assault from hundreds of enemies, the final mission was a colossal letdown. It threw a grand total of 80-ish enemies at me (there's a counter) in a single, boring mazelike interior environment, much like any other mission. There was no colossal assault, it was literally a hunt-and-destroy mission like hundreds of others. I had to go and find THEM hiding in tiny pockets of resistance, and just nuke them with aoe weapons.\n\nI spent a long time building up a perfectly engineered sniper and engineer-scientist combo, and created a huge fort of sentry guns expecting to have to fight off thousands of bots, and maybe some colossal monster. What i got was a pathetic skirmish with only slightly more enemies than an average mission. it was a dismal and hollow end to the game. There's no real reward or sense of closure either, after the battle you jsut get a "congratulations you won, now go and relax" textbox, and the game just stops on the main map screen with nothing being clickable. No ending cutscene, no conclusion to the story, just nothing.\n\nI spent £1.74 on this game, and my initial thoughts after buying it were that i'd gotten an amazing deal. But as the novelty wore off, that seemed like a pretty reasonable price. It's great fun for an hour or two, and mildly entertaining for a few more after that, but there's no real reason to replay it.\n\nYou should probably quit before you finish the game, and just imagine that it had a good ending.","March 21, 2014","true","12.1"," 29 of 34 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","29","34","0","3"

These are the guys, after all, who brought us the bizarre concept of a strategy game where you fight against yourself – Skyward Collapse – and the highly-acclaimed RTS/4X/tower defence hybrid – AI War: Fleet Command . Thankfully, in addition to being quite oddly named, Bionic Dues does not at all threaten to disappoint our expectations. Instead it continues the trend of stylish and interesting roguelikes peppering the indie-scene, and it does it with all the imaginative design we would come to expect from developers like these.\n\nYou play the role of a rookie mech pilot tasked with protecting a futuristic mega-city from a sudden robot rebellion. Having four specialised mechs at your disposable, you have 50 days to perform missions which either strengthen your crew or weaken the enemy, before facing off a final massive attack wave in your HQ to end the game. A failed mission means a wasted day and the enemy grows in number and strength whilst you gain nothing. As time goes on, missions increase in difficulty due to the enemy level-ups; thus mimicking the ongoing arms race between your mechs and the belligerent AI mobs.\n\nThe game embraces RPG-like mechanics and allows several levels of customisation. Firstly, you may choose from a selection of mech pilots who have varying gameplay bonuses; for example, higher quality loot or economic discounts from the item store you can access in-between missions. Secondly, you may select the four mech classes which will make up your team. These range from heavily armoured high-damage short-range tank-like units, to long-range weakly-shielded snipers, to specialised science mechs. Each mech has a different selection of weapons available of the kind you would expect to see.\n\nYour mechs are primarily improved over time by equipping them with the items you loot, earn or buy. In traditional dungeon-crawl form, items are named according to their level and bonuses, and colour-coded according to their degree of rareness. Additionally, they come in various types which fit in the corresponding specialised slots on your mech’s load-out. These include various types of weapon-slots, shield-slots, computer-slots, etc. The system more or less mimics a Diablo-style paper-doll with some items being similar to various types of armour or weapons and other types operating more like rings or amulets.\n\nHowever in Bionic Dues this system is further complicated by the fact that each item has a power requirement which limits the number of high-level items a mech can utilise. This upper-limit can only be increased by equipping a certain type of reactor item which, rather than consuming power, produces it. Your mechs don’t actually level-up, and this system replaces that standard RPG mechanic. The overall effect of all these complications in total, coupled with the abundance of loot which improves upon the items you already have, has the effect that it becomes a little hard to care about absolute min-maxing of your mechs’ load-outs.\n\nThe majority of gameplay happens within the missions. These very much take traditional roguelike form; a basic-sidebar accompanies a top-down futuristic tiled-floor dungeon map. Each mission has a simple objective such as blow up all the control-station-things, reach the exit-point, or kill all the enemies. Your limited sensor range, which varies from mech to mech and can be augmented with certain items, only allows you to see a small section of the map. This leaves much of the map unexplored at first.\n\nThe apparently randomly-generated maps are filled with item-crates, traps, obstacles, enemies, and, of course, your objective. In addition, loot is hidden behind locked doors which can only be hacked open with a special mech-skill normally best-performed by the science mech. In this busy environment line-of-sight becomes crucial, allowing for either tactical destruction of, or hiding behind, obstacles.\n\nAlthough the game functions in turn-based form, it generally plays quite rapidly as most situations allow and even encourages the player to make moves hastily. This kind of attitude can later prove fatal when a deadly BombBot is accidentally allowed to get far too close for comfort. The gameplay is such that it consistently creates the beautifully ironic why-the-hell-did-I-do-that and oh-my-god-I-am-so-dead moments that roguelike players have come to know and love/hate.\n\nIn general, Bionic Dues is incredibly well put-together. Every gameplay mechanic is so openly explained in tooltips that absolutely everything can be calculated if so desired. The game’s tutorial popups are slick, well-written and comprehensive. On top of that, the game comes heavily-equipped with a fantastic sense of humour. Everything from the enemy descriptions to the mission briefings are written with the attitude of a winking-smiley and I frequently laughed-out-loud as I read through them. This only backfires in the form of the comedic enemy death-cries, which although entertaining at first soon become rather repetitive and thus somewhat irritating.\n\nThe 2D graphics are little-more than functional, nevertheless the techno-futuristic style does have a certain charm. The benefit of having this kind of setup, of course, is that Bionic Dues will run smoothly on just about every PC which is actually able to start up. The audio, on the other hand, is a definite cut above the norm. The in-mission music reminds of early-90s midi classics, and the menu music, despite being a bit amateurish, has a certain indie-band charm. The voiceover quality matches that of the music, after each mission a very cool deep-throated narrator gives a mini-rundown on how things are going.\n\nThe game offers a good selection of 6 difficulty settings which range from casual to an aptly named misery; a popup tooltip describes the exact effect of each setting in as much clinical detail anyone would ever want. As if that wasn’t enough, an additional hardcore mode checkbox sits enticingly below the difficulty slider; taunting the player by promising to overwrite your only permitted save-slot any time something really embarrassing happens.\n\nOn the negative side, I must admit that the complete lack of both endgame statistics and a decent story-line closure was pretty disappointing. I did also once manage to get the top-down camera lost deep within the fog-of-war and had some difficulty finding my way back to my mechs; providing mild frustration. Finally, it’s worth mentioning that although there is a storyline of sorts accompanying the game, it’s far too weak to be the player’s primary motivation to play on.\n\nPutting these minor gripes aside; if you can’t tell already, I really like this game. Indie devs don’t always come up with the goods, but Arcen are doing a damn fine job of it. Bionic Due is not only a necessary purchase for all true rogue-clone fans, but it’d easily be a pride-worthy addition to the game collection of anyone with even a remote interest in this sort of thing.","March 2","true","36.4"," 20 of 20 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","20","20","2","1"

If you like turn based strategy games you will love this. The game is finish able even on the first try. The ability to save whenever you wish is a big plus. The interface is easy and straightforward as long as the option for mouse movement is NOT selected (If it is, then placing mines and turrets in a specific location will be a nightmare). The mission variation is fantastic and constant trying to choose which mission to do next and trying to decide when to fight the final battle adds tension to the already tense and fun dungeon crawls. There are several types of missions, and which one you choose can have a significant impact on how the game progresses. A new game starts on the city map where you choose from a web of different mission types. As you complete or fail missions, more are revealed. You win the game by either surviving the inevitable final bot onslaught, or lose when your headquarters are destroyed. There is a lot of replay ability value as your strategy will need to change depending on the lead character you select and the mech team you select. During the missions, you only control one mech (called "exos" in game) at a time, but you have four in your stable. There is a ton of generated loot you can use to improve your exos with, which you get from completing missions, find in chests, or buy from the shop. You can swap your exo for another at any time, though it will cost you an action. You lose the mission if all four exos are destroyed. There are six different exo classes, with an epic variation of each. There are also six different pilots to choose from, each with a unique ability.

You spend a turn to either move or take an action, then all the enemies do the same.\n\nEach mission takes place in an enviroment of connected corridors and rooms where you get aggro from nearby robots and use your abilities to either avoid them or kill them. The goal of each mission is to achieve objectives, leave the map, and get diablo style prefix-item-postfix style loot, complete with color coding for rarity.\n\nYou have a team of 4 different characters (exos, human sized robots) but they all occupy the same map tile, and you can only have one active at a time. That's the twist in the particular dungeon crawling game. It takes a turn to switch between your exos, which you'll want to do because the different exos have different abilities and limited resources like ammo and hitpoints.\n\nAfter each mission you can customize your exos with all that neat loot you've been finding. The various parts you find tend to be multipurpose, so there are always choices to make, both about what exo gets what part, and where on the exo to put the part.\n\nI found the exo equiping part of the game very satisfying and had several super tricked out exos specializing in incredible shield tanking, firepower, stealth/virus attacks, and stealth/virus attacks near the end of my first game with the default character and exo setup.\n\nOverall, I'd say this made the medium difficulty campaign fairly easy. The final mission(s) were mostly a chore to hunt down all of the bots. I've yet to replay the game, but replayability seems high since you can pick different character bonuses and exo team composisions each game.

In this game you control robots, "Exos", destroying enemy robots and collecting loot from the battlefields. The turn-by-turn mechanics are familiar from roguelikes such as NetHack, but the scifi setting reminds me of FTL. Cannot go wrong with that recipe!\n\nBetween each mission you are returned to the City Screen where you can also go and customize the Exos. This part, too, reminds me of customizing the spaceship in FTL: you need to select the most appropriate weapons and tools to all slots of the Exos and keep in mind the power constraint.\n\nIn the game you only control one Exo at a time, so no squad-based combat here. You can always swap the current Exo to another one, but that costs one turn, like everything else. The challenge is, of course, how to kill the enemies without getting killed yourself. Going in with your laser blazing usually ends in you getting killed, so you need to be more clever than that. One strategy is to use Stealth, get close to a powerful enemy, infect it with a virus and watch it kill the other enemies.\n\nOnce your Exo gets killed, it's out for the rest of the mission, so when you've got four Exos in total, you in a sense have four lives in each mission. The Exos have different strengths and weaknesses (just like the ships in FTL are different from each other), so, for example, getting your hacker Exo killed might make it impossible to hack impassable doors behind which loot usually lies.\n\nThe achievements seem to be something that actually need to be pursued, compared to some games that reward you with five as long as you just complete the tutorial.

Bionic Dues is what you'd get if you crossed a traditional Roguelike with FTL and then baked in the theme of Mechwarrior. What comes out is a mixture of RPG-like progression and turnbased tactics layered ontop of a strategy meta-game that provides a high level of replayability between campaigns.\n\nIn Bionic Dues you command a 'team' of four Exos (mechs), each with their own weaponry systems and specializations that can be further customized by acquiring loot from winning missions or finding/hacking chests. The caveat to this 'team' is that you can only pilot one of your Exos at a time, but can switch between them at any time during the missions.\n\nBefore the game starts you choose up to 4 Exos from a pool of 6 types, and then pick your commander who will provide a unique tactical advantage which will drastically change how you play the game. All of this is wrapped up into an FTL style mission selector which will give you some choice as to how your path through the game progresses, and ultimately help you stave off defeat. Losing a mission or a unit does not necessarily mean the end of the game either as traditional roguelike permadeath is optional, which is what really allows the campaign metagame to shine.\n\nEach mission you embark on has its own objectives and unique attributes, your goals range from kill all the enemies to destroy certain targets, to simply just evade and escape in time. In one mission type, all of the cover is rigged to explode when destroyed, knowing this and using it to your advantage to take down enemies you couldnt easily kill otherwise is just one useful strategy to employ against an overwhelming force. There are roughly 20+ different mission varieties as well, and choosing which ones to embark on between re-fitting your Exos is critical to your success.\n\nIf you try going head to head with the enemy in this game without realizing their weaknesses, or your own strengths, you're almost certain to be in for a rough time. Understanding the quirks of each of the 45+ different enemies, how they move, shoot, and affect other enemy units; all of that is necessary for survival. Once you understand a few of the game's less well-explained quirks, you begin to realize just how much depth there is to the combat. The sheer amount of unique enemies can be a little daunting at first and some combinations can lead to complicated and outright unfair or impossible situations.\n\nOne example of this is that early on in the game there are enemy bots which will one-shot you with their explosive missile weapons. After a few missions into the game they will probably begin to out-range you too and can kill you in a single shot. Ontop of that they have shields that would deplete a sizeable chunk of your ammo supply to destroy, if you could survive that many turns to kill them. Thankfully they have very little ammunition (unless an ammo bot is nearby) but are not always the best shot. This type of enemy can be dealt with in multiple ways: a long range Exo, a stealth unit thats immune to splash damage (but not direct hits such as the Ninja), one capable of shooting around corners with splash damage, even detonating obstacles or certain enemy bots nearby. Thats not to mention mines, sentries, or simply just stealthing past it.\n\nPros:\n- Procedurally generated map and mission layouts.\n- Huge variety of enemies (Changes with each new game)\n- Wide variety tactics to use, if you're creative enough.\n- 6 different Exos, 6 commanders, and 6 difficulty levels.\n- Loot system allows you to customize aspects of your units.\n- Large number of mission types with different rewards.\n\nCons:\n- Too many enemies can make missions drag on a little sometimes.\n- Inconsistent difficulty based on starting choice and random factors.\n- Randomized enemy deployment can lead to unfair combinations.\n- Can easily spend too much time on the Exo customization screen.\n- Level design and aesthetic feels a bit bland and samey after awhile.\n\nConclusion:\nArcen has done a good job with Bionic Dues, but its not without a few pitfalls; the sheer variety of enemies, interactions, and range of difficulty levels can lead to inconsistent experiences between games. New players have a lot to learn and will need to pay attention to enemy sensor and weapon ranges as well as learn to use the environment, mission types, and ground-targeting to their advantage. Using sensors to provoke enemies and lure them to you in the right order, and employing the Science Exo's EMP pistol (which does not use up a turn) to disable enemy movement and block hallways can be the difference between success and failure.","January 27","true","66.9"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

First of all every information you'll get you need to play the game is in the form of text. I really don't know why game developers don't learn from other games or in this case from thier own games. Arcen(the guys who made the game) really need to learn that if they make a game that is fairly complex, they should make an interactive tutorial not a wall of text.  The mechanic with the map where you are able to select your missions is a great idea but wasn't implemented very well. Sometimes the only missions you are given are the ones you aren't capable of completing because your Mechs are to weak. This gets frustrating really easily. The customization screen is the most disorganized  screen I have ever seen In a video game. There are way to many stats to keep track of and way to many slots the equipment can be put. It is not fun to customize your Mech because the proccess feels like working at an office. And how is the roguelike gameplay? It's actually kinda fun but what ruins it is that the game doesn't really tell you what to do in a mission. Your objective is told you through a text-wall and sometimes you have no idea what they want from you? For example: "This is a mission where you'll aquire more weapons at the end". Ok? So what do I have to do? Kill all enemy-robots? Or collect a certain Item? I don't know. Oh and the presentation is horrible ;D\n\nBIONIC DUES is not a bad game but it's not a good one either.","February 27, 2015","false","3.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","4"

I was not disappointed, and ended up with a very satisfying - but still brutal - experience.\n\nIf you enjoy the rogue-like genre, robot theme, turn-based combat, and lots of death and loot, then you will enjoy this game.\n\nThe aesthetics are decent - the robot models and animations are nothing too fancy. The music and sounds are good, but I personally found the opening (menu) song annoying after a few repetitions. The random dialogue that the enemy robots shout out is comical - ex: "why was I programmed to feel pain?" Eventually, I just muted all the sounds and played my own music.\n\nThe controls are simple and quick to learn. There are pop-up tutorials and the feedback when you hover over things is very helpful. The learning curve is minimal to moderate depending on your experience with the rogue-like genre and grid/turn-based games. The difficulty can be adjusted, and you will most likely not be playing misery for a long time - unless you are a glutton for punishment.\n\nGameplay is fast-paced and unforgiving - your goal is to prepare for an inevitable final battle against the robot horde (similar to the end-game boss fight in Faster than Light). You are presented with a randomly-generated map layout with branching missions. Doing a mission (regardless of failing/passing) will unlock the rest of the missions that are connected to that particular branch. Depending on the difficulty you are playing on, you will get x loot pieces per surviving robot member (aka Exo) after the mission is completed. You will also get different loot types depending on the mission you select - for example, laboratory missions will give you more computer modules. Whenever you fail, your HQ will lose a hit point, and if you reach 0, you will lose the game. Completing salvage missions will repair some damage to your HQ.\n\nAfter every mission, more enemy robots are manufactured - you can hinder this by attacking robot command centers, which reduce the number of days before the final battle. You can also hunt down boss robots, making the end-game battle a bit easier. Be warned, these missions are extremely challenging, and should not be attempted until you have acquired mid- to high-tier gear. Your Exos do not level up - instead, you upgrade them with acquired loot. You can select 4 different Exos to make up your party, and you can even select 4 of the same type if you wish (this is not recommended). Examples include a sniper, ninja (stealth-based), and science (hacker/support) Exo. The character you select at the start of the game will give you different bonuses - I strongly suggest you select Tuck for your first few playthroughs because his sensor ability (allows you to see the objective and any loot containers) will increase your situational awareness greatly.\n\nDuring mission gameplay, you move with the WASD keys and use the mouse to select weapons/skills. You travel as a single entity, so switching Exos will use one turn. This is critical to understand because you will automatically switch to the next Exo if your current one is destroyed - and I would die unnecessarily because I would waste a turn switching my science Exo to a different one, giving the enemy a free shot (and usually a free kill) at the Exo I switched to. You can blow up some doors, but others will have to be hacked in order to get to the loot containers within. Terminals also require hacking points, which is why a science Exo is essential to anyone wanting to maximize loot gained per mission. Many missions just require you to reach an endpoint mission marker, which is usually deep in the far end of the map. Each Exo can stealth past enemies for a short amount of movement spaces, but only the ninja Exo is able to attack while still staying in stealth mode. Some loot containers/terminals may restore your ammo, shields, hack points, or stealth points, however, some terminals may disable a random weapon or deplete all hacking points - such is the way of RNG-based games.\n\nOverall, the game is a lot of fun if you like challenging grid/turn-based combat, and any rogue-like enthusiasts should give Bionic Dues a try.\n\nRecommend!\n\nCheers,\nDJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews","January 18, 2015","true","1.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It's a turnbased strategy game with mechs where you have 50 days to prepare against unevitable doom by completeling randomly generated missions. The concept is awesome which is to be expected from Arcen Games.\n\nThe main problem I had was that the missions felt kindof like a slog and a bit samey. The combat was also pretty cutthroat. You'll usually kill the enemy in one hit and they can do the same thing to you which sounds interesting but I didn't happen to like it afterwards. In most cases you'll blow through the levels killing everything in your path and if you make one misstep, you can die. This is probably done to make the levels seem challenging but it didn't really end up that way.\n\nI'm not sure how I'd change it to make the game more enjoyable for me. I was thinking about making the combat less binary by buffing the health of you and your enemies. Maybe instead of having one mech on the field that you can switch out, you could have a group of mechs on the field. Maybe I would've like a more "classic" strategy RPG leveling up system where you unlock skills by leveling up. It's a bit strange really. Arcen Games removed the slow grindy bits of an S-RPG but in hindsight I actually liked those slow grindy bits.","May 1, 2014","false","3.1"," 16 of 28 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","16","28","0","0"

I got this in a bundle deal, so yeah, it cost me about nothing.  I wasn't especially interested in this title, but gave it a try, and hey it has cards ;)\n\nThe first time or two that I tried it out I didn't find it very engaging.  The menus could be better, and the learning curve is rough at first.  The graphics are not expected to be fancy in this sort of game and they aren't, but they aren't bad and in an arcade time killer like this it's the gameplay that counts, and it has excellent depth, challenge and  balance once you begin to get attuned to it.  The music isn't bad, and the theme is pretty catchy in a Japanese arcade kind of way.\n\nYou choose missions from a map, and prep for each mission by choosing a pilot and 4 (out of 6) of your exo-suits, which you customize before each mission.  In missions you can switch between suits at any time at the cost of one turn, and the mission fails if you manage to wreck all of your suits.  Customizing the exo's is fun as you find loot and upgrades along the way, and can spend loot at the upgrade store which also gets in new items of course.\n\nYou definitely can't just plow your way through this one.  There are plenty of firefights, but it's more like a chess game at times.  You might find health or ammo during a mission, but it's rare, so you're forced to choose which of your suits could best use it to get the particular mission done.\n\nNot gonna be anyone's main game, but like I said;  pretty fun, challenging, cheap, time killer, trading cards and shades of Jpop.\n\n","June 24, 2014","true","11.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

On the one hand it's a fairly shallow story(not that it needs more) and the gameplay doesn't  have a lot of variety to the mechanics. But on the other hand what it does, it does extremely well.\n\nFirst of all: this is a rogue-like, make no mistake about it. Hate roguelike? This won't convert you.\n\nYour city has been taken over, no ones coming to help, it's just you, 4 exo suits, and some guy in a van down by the river (he sells you scrap that he salvages).\n\nYou have 50 days before the robot army finishes off your base. Each day you have time to complete 1 mission, visit the salvage van and upgrade your exo suits. While out on a mission you can teleport (swap between) exo suits, each exo is designed with different weapon layouts and is further tweaked by your customizations each day.\n\nWhere the game shines is the sheer customizability. Before you even start you choose which 4 exo suits you will use, what pilot you will control (different bonus skills) and a full range of difficulty settings.\n\nIf you get frustrated failing while learning, I suggest dropping the difficulty below normal (even normal is challenging until you've fully understood all the customization and gameplay choices); and than ramping up with each new play through.\n\nThere is a lot of ways to challenge yourself and tons of replay value if you want to figure out how to get through the highest difficulty levels.\n\nOne of the best roguelikes I've played in years, and one of very few that make me want to keep trying again even after winning just to see if I can do better and score even higher.\n\nAlso of note: the song on the main menu is almost worth the price of the game by itself, just wish there was more of it.","March 27","true","46.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Great indie devs with a positive development philosophy - DRM free, plenty of updates, expansions that don't price-gouge you.\n\nBionic Dues (mostly on harder levels of difficulty) demands that you make good decisions on all strategic/tactical levels from the lowest level of how you are going to clear a room of bots, to the next level of how you are going to conserve ammo in order to complete the mission, to the next level of mission selection balancing short-term and long-term goals. And finally, deciding on how to outfit your Exos to tie all of the above together. Plenty of decisions to make before you can even start the game - make a party of 4 mechs out of a selection of 6 (including duplicates), choose 1 of 6 pilots with very unique traits, and finally a wide range of difficulty settings make for an absurd amount of replayability value.\n\nMy biggest nitpicks are really those that are fairly intrinsic to the rogue-like genre.\n1) After the nth play through, some levels can just feel tedious and long and present little original challenge to the player.\n2) The documenation is slightly lacking. The ingame help and tooltips are great for the basics,  and even the intermediates, but a few advanced topics get unmentioned. The lack of a well developed wiki doesn't help, either.

The choices you make in the strategic layer have a big impact on the way the game plays out.  Bionic Dues is a game that succeeeds on the sum of its parts.\n\n\nWorst Thing About It:\n\nThe art direction.  It is an unattractive game.  The "dungeon runs" are hideous, and the remote controlled robots theme  doesn't do much for me.  I would have much rather seen this game themed as a Star Wars style, rebel strike team or even a G.I. Joe style special ops theme.\n\n************************************************************************************\n\nI recommend this game.  You should play in iron man mode and learn to roll with the tough decisions and consequences you face in the strategic portion of the game.  Every turn the enemy is growing stronger, but you have a lot of different ways to attack and weaken the enemy, and ways to strengthen your own forces.  The strategic part of the game is great because every choice and every event has a real and visible effect.\n\nThe "rogue like" missions are also fun, because each game the enemy builds and deploys various robots that behave in very specific ways.  FIguring out how to exploit these robots' weaknesses while avoiding a variety of attacks is fun, and each play you face different mixes of robots--so its like a proceedurally generated combat and stealth puzzle.\n\nEach game counts down to a final confrentation, and what the enemy throws at you depends very much on what occured throughout the strategic layer of the campaign.  Enemy forces composition and "bosses" are randomly determined each game, so there is a lot of variety.\n\nMy only complaint is appearance and theme.  I'm really not into the remote controlled mechs or the pilots or the "grid look" of the dungeon crawls.  Its a great game though, and I recommend you learn to live with the passable art direction and enjoy this very well designed game.  I give it a big yes.\n\n","January 28","true","21.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

In about a month, they will attack your home base and destroy you all. You are the last remaining pilot for the Exosuit, which is the only thing that can stand between you and the robot army, and your job is to run missions to find upgrades for your suit and to sabotage the robots themselves.\n\nThe gameplay takes place on a grid and is semi-turn based. Every time you move, attack, etcetera, your turn is used up and the enemy may do something. But it runs so fluidly it almost feels real time. Your objective is different depending on what mission you choose, and that's the fun part.\n\nThere is no possible way to do all missions presented in a single game, not to mention the fact that what is available is randomly generated when you start. The fun comes in choosing what missions to do; do you take on the assasination mission and kill one of the bosses early? Do you go to a weapons factory to get shiny new weapon parts for your suits? Maybe you lost a mission and your HQ is low on health, so you need to do a mission to repair it? You only have so much time so you have to choose wisely.\n\nOn top of all this, there are several difficulty levels and several pilots who completely change the way the game played. With the pilot I used, it's sort of cheating because you start off with the enhanced suits (whereas normally you need to find them yourself). The other pilots have other passives that make sure no two playthroughs are similar. And of course, you have several different suits as well, but you can only choose four at the start of the game; I used the Science, Ninja, Assault, and Siege (I believe those are the names) but again, it's up to you. Actually there are achievements for completing the game with four of a single suit type, so you could try that. Honestly it's real endless the ways you could play the game.\n\nI only played through once, but it took me 10 hours. I can't wait until I have the time to go through it again. If you like how it sounds, then buy it without hesitation.","May 16, 2014","true","10.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's much more accessible than AI War or A Valley Without Wind, but retains similar mechanics and crazy random generation. This one is a turn-based puzzle-roguelike. You manage a team of four powersuits, go into varied dungeon-missions and gather upgrades against an approaching robotic army. You have so many different tactics to employ based on your team and equipment, the levels themselves become like puzzles where there is always a solution if you can figure out the best approach. Kind of like Desktop Dungeons. Do you want to set up a trap with mines and sentryguns and then just make noise to attract the enemies into them? Or should you just employ massive rocket launchers to purify full rooms with fire? Missions are quick and bite-sized and the world map has many of them offered at the same time, making this a game of difficult choices.\n\nThere's a doomsday clock here like in most Arcen creations: You have a limited amount of missions to do before the end battle comes, you're supposed to either become more powerful by then or sabotage the enemy forces enough but the enemies grow in power too while you're on missions. If you just grind for upgrades, so does the enemy. You need to pick your desired missions from the map surgically instead of doing everything, just like in AI War.\n\nThe graphics and sounds are awful and I mostly ignored the scifi theme and lore, but if you can stomach the ugliness this is quite an interesting twist on roguelikes and a good grab during sales.","January 21, 2014","true","7.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This game is incomplete. Plenty of bugs and unfair situations. For example, enemies capable of shooting you through walls, 'cover', and completely random drops. As well, the game does a sort of lazy attempt to explain things to you, or fails to tell you additional helpful things. For example, when completing an armory mission, you MIGHT find loot boxes on the map which will give you mission specific parts. The tutorial neglects to tell you at the end of those types of missions any exo that survived will reward you an editional part.\nAs well, despite pictures and the such that shows having more than one party member (I use the term loosely), you can only have one of those 'mechs' out at a time. You can freely switch from one to another (something I don't think is ever explained at all), but it uses a turn.\nHow things play out when switching isn't exactly clear. What if you are cloaked, turn orders, being within range of an enemy when switching, etc.. it's all a bit unclear, and there is no help function in the game either. At least none that I found.\nIn regards to enemies shooting through walls, I encountered an enemy, a boss enemy to be more specific, that states that it doesn't attack, but will shoot at whoever fires within it's range. Apparently, this goes for players who are undected, several rooms over, cloaked, etc.\nA modest pool of health, long range, decent attack power, and the ability to shoot you whenever you are within its range, regardless of position.. leads you to being caught in an unfair, uphill battle.\nThen there are some bugs that I found. Your mouse cursor and buttons sometimes don't line up, glitches that turn all your stats to zero, the ability to use in game saves to your advantage (getting a better item from a loot chest).\nAll in all, the game has potential, but numerous issues leave me quitting the game in frustration or disappointment more than anything else.\nI would recommend buying this game for no more than $2 if you're still interested.\nThe issues I have had with this game can be fixed with some updating, I'm sure.

I can't reccomend this highly, but I won't say I won't reccomend it.\n\nTo simplify what it is, it's a rougelike turn based mech game. Permadeath is optional.\n\nAnd...I honestly expected more than that. The biggest highlight of the game is the main theme. It's VERY good.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFCClIC-ZXs\n\nTake a listen while you read this, if you want.\n\nIf you do/are listening to it, let it sink in for a moment.\n\nIt's pretty cool, isn't it? It has a pretty serious tone while just being a generally badass way to open up the main menu to the game.\n\nI actually got overhyped when listening to this. Now, granted, I did get a free key from one of PC Gamer's key giveaways, but..I'll still judge the game as if I bought it.\n\n\nBut...I think it's because my expectations sky rocketed, that I didn't find the game as AMAZING as I did find the theme.\n\nIt's pretty fun, though. You have (Up to four) mecha suits that you start off with, and use their diverse abilities to destory robots. The robots are taking over the earth, and they've reached your part of the city. When you start the game, you'll be told you have 50 days until your hometown is NUKED.\n\nYikes. Time to kick some ♥♥♥.\n\nYou're able to pick four mech suits out of six available, and I only found one being...pretty damn useless. Every other mech suit is rather fun and has a decent difference from the others. One thing to note, is that when you find parts to upgrade yourself with, you'll find that the suits don't ever get to change weapons. The weapons are pretty much bolted and weld into the suit. You'll find modifications that'll allow you to make them stronger.\n\nScience: This suit isn't reliable for combat. It has 50% bonuses to ALL Computer stats. Perfect for hacking and inflicting viruses on foes. This one is the one that'll be in any group of four you will make, because of how damn useful the Hacks are.\n\n\nBrawler: This suit's a weird one. I thought it would consist of short range weaponry that'd pratically all one hit kill. But, no, it's armed with a X cross bomb, a shotgun, and a pistol. The pistol's a waste (3 turn cooldown, but it doesn't count against your turn. It's..unbeliveably weak. You actually need to focus on building it up to...one shotting the lowest leveled foes. It's pointless unless you JUST need to shave off a few remaining points of health, so you don't waste your other weapon's ammo.) It's still a blast to use, though. You can make some pretty neat trickshots with this one.\n\n\nSniper: Style. Obliteration. A flippin' life saver. It holds one of the most powerful sniper weapons in the game FROM THE VERY START. Whenever this special sniper rifle's ammo count is an even number when you fire it, it's a free turn for you. Holy. ♥♥♥♥. It's got the 2nd lowest ammo out of the Non Epic weapons, but it's just so damn satisfying to use. It also has an ungoddly amount of range. Safe to say, this suit is just so awesome. It's fragile as hell, but you would probably know how to use a sniper, don't you?\n\n\nNinja: I'll be honest. This is the suit I have a problem with. But, to be honest, it's not BAD. It's got a bonus to all Propulsion stats (Which, by the way, includes the ability to dodge traps and your stealth turn counter) and it's stealth doesn't break when you fire your weapons. Pretty neat, but...Unless you have the Epic Ninja (I'll explain in a moment.) don't expect to do very much unless you focus on giving the Ninja as much stealth as possible. Stealth, in this game, is pretty nice. Every single suit has stealth, and can upgrade the amount it has. The Ninja's just perfect for this stat. If you activate Stealth, each turn you spend moving around will cause the counter to go down by one. The stealth break if you fire a weapon, drop a sentry, use mines..but not actions like hacking a door.\n\n\nAssault: A good all around suit. Even has 60% bonus to health. It comes with a grenade launcher, a machine gun, and a laser. Nothing else really special about this suit, except that it doesn't have the weak as ♥♥♥♥ pistol.\n\n\nSeige: Rocket. Launcher. Enuff said. But, alright. Seriously, THIS ROCKET LAUNCHER. It has the least amount of ammo for non Epic weapons, but, holy crap. This thing can wipe out an entire room and IT'S HUGE AOE. I can't stress enough that this thing is by far the STRONGEST ROCKET LAUNCHER in a game I've ever seen.\n\nOn top of having six different Suits to use, with four to pick at any start of a new game, you also have six different suit commanders to pick from. Now, these people are VERY unique in having different "powers" (one of them quite litterally) and the one you pick can have a heavy impact on the game.\n\nAxis: The "Scout" of the commanders you can choose from. Here's a picture for the example of someone without Axis's ability. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=535296679\n\nNow, here's Axis's ability. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=535296639\n\nThis is Axis's power. Allowing you to not only see farther on the map, but you can BYPASS a mission to get to another that's connected to it. If you're picky on missions, or want to open up the map without wasting your days, Axis can be worth it.\n\nEmma: Emma's power is all about the store. Not only will you get much more money for selling items to it, the store's contents are usually better than if you played someone else.\n\nThis is someone's inventory, that isn't Emma.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=535298959\n\nNow this is the inventory of Emma, with the price power she has.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=535299195\n\nSo, in a nutshell, a extreme shopper.\n\nMeg: All item you pick up are basically better than they should be. The game explains this pretty well. A "mark four" item would have the stats of a "mark six" item, and so on.\n\nRey: Oh, boy. This guy's outta control. He has the power over time, but only in the way of being able to restore a suit's health all the way back to 100% twice each mission. And, no, this isn't a per exo thing. You have two lives that save you from your first two deaths. After that, the ability wont work until the next mission.\n\nTuck: Eh. He's able to see loot everywhere on the map. Not really the best ability.  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=535300067\n\nGenji: Can I just say how badass this commander is? He's so ♥♥♥♥ing badass, that he starts off the game with ALL HIS SUITS BEING OF "EPIC" VERSIONS.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=535291917\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=535291927\n\nEpic suits have more guns than Duke Nukem up their robotic asses and have more spaces for modding capability. Holy ♥♥♥♥.\n\nThese suits have some pretty OP weapons. Even using the "Random Exo" option, you can't get Epic suits at the start if you don't use Genji.\n\nTo get them in the game without his badass help, is to find a rare Bahamahut Device mission on the map.\n\nI can only reccomend this game on the Casual setting. The higher (yes, even easy) take fun away from the game the higher the difficulty you pick.\n\nThe game gets unbelievably harder for each difficulty you jump up. If you do pick any of those settings, the game changes to every mission being a chance of life or death, but the odds against you increase almost litterally tenfold for every difficulty you jump up on.\n\nOn top of all of that, the game..feels a little incomplete. I'm not sure what's yanking my leg about this, but it feels half finished. Like I'm playing a demo.\n\nThere's "Score" to this game, but it honestly does nothing other than for high scores.\n\nThe game itself isn't as serious as it's main theme. It jokingly laughs at itself. It's a completely different tone than what I wished for.\nIn short, the game isn't complex. If you want a mindless shooting time, pick this up.","October 15, 2015","true","16.7"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","5"

(If you move this turn, your friends can't).\n\n-After a while you'll probably get bored with all the one-liners enemy robots spout when they are destroyed.\n\n-Over time it might possibly start to seem a little repetitive as it basically boils down to upgrade, pick mission, blow stuff up, rinse, & repeat, ad infinitum.","February 2, 2014","true","6.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And I have to be honest, this is probably the best game that Arcen has ever made.\n\nThe gameplay alternates between moving around on a grid like a typical Roguelike, destroying whatever is necessary to complete the objective, and taking all the loot back to base to customise your squad of four mechas. In most games, I've rarely cared about the equipment and customization aspects of these kind of games, but the simple, bite-sized nature of this game's structure means I care about the equipment management aspect a lot more, and whenever I go into a mission with a new set of equipment, I really feel the change in power paying off. That's what an equipment system SHOULD feel like.\n\nOn top of this, the game has an excellent sense of humour, not just in the item descriptions (Which is another reason why the micromanagement is so fun), but also in the defeat quotes of the enemy mechas. I won't spoil any of them here, but their brevity and variety means they never get old or stop being funny.\n\nBionic Dues is a fantastic game. It provides an interesting shortened Roguelike approach towards its gameplay, and, as is the case with Arcen's usual mission statement, provides a presentation with a lot of personality and humour. Definitely worth picking up!","November 29, 2013","true","6.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

When I first picked this game up, it was confusing, and rather intimidating.  The tutorial, while helpful, was not as informative as it probably could have been.  Adjusting the difficulty of the game, you will find a wash of text information that not only doesn't make any sense, but really won't make sense till you actually get into the game, so I just recommend starting on normal so you can experience some challenge, and some life lessons that the easier difficulties will probably not provide.  Unfortunately, alot of the mechanics of the game are hidden, much the same as many Rogue-likes in the genre.\n\nBionic Dues places humanity (in a city) on the brink of extinction.  You are the last suriving folks in a quarentined city.  You are also made fully aware in the first minute of the game, that the government is going to glass the city (bomb it to crap) to kill the out of control infected robot invasion menace (you included).  You are placed in an overworld map, and a variety of missions will spawn around you.  This layout changes with every game, so don't expect to plan your routes.\n\nYou will find when you first start the game, that there are alot of mysteries as to why the game is so damn difficult.  But after you start to figure out the mechanics of the game you will make more and more progress.  The issue is, that with every mission you take on, fail or succeed, the monsters of the game level up and grow in number.  This can be frustrating, but stick with it, it gets ALOT better.\n\nEvery monster in the game has a unique personality, that when properly exploited, will spell the only real way to succeed in the harder difficulties.  A mission can still be finished with lack luster gear, if the proper enemies are present, and properly manipulated.  Granted, equipment, the proper enemy spawns, and level layout, are random, so no gaurantee that the moons will align.  Be sure to save often, it is a total lifeline.\n\nUnfortunately for my gameplay experience, when I figured out how the game worked, the normal difficulty was a simple steam rolling session of success after success after success, minus a few situations that totally screwed me. The early portion of the game is most certainly difficult.  The slightest mistake can end with one if not two of your Exo's being destroyed instantly.  But later on, your Exo's can take so much damage, that it they are comparable to some of the boss monsters in the game.  Don't get me wrong, even when you get that powerful, things can still happen that can shaft you, at least that remains consistent.\n\nBottom line though, this game will easily give you hours of entertainment.  The game is incredibly fun, surprisingly deep, and should give quite the lengthy playtime if you like challenging yourself with the levels of diffiuclty (misery being the real way to play the game)  I do recommend this.  Its got a little strategy, its got alot of random chance, and given the mechanics, it can either be easy, or challenging based on your preferences.  Definitely worth the investment of time and money.","September 25, 2014","true","15.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You control\na squad of four Exos (think Mechas) defending the city against robot invasion,\nthough during a mission you control only one at a time and simply "switch" from\none to another, so there's no true squad-based play involved. The layout of\nparticular missions in a city is generated at the start of the game so no two\nplaythroughs are the same. Each mission is obviously also generated.\n\nOverall it's a great game with a lot of replayability. Sounds and music are OK,\nexcept for the slightly annoying track with vocals in main menu. Graphics and\nclear and seem simple (in a good way), all the while having nice details on a\ncloser inspection (like exhaust smoke trailing the player's Exo). The game is\nsimple to play yet has much depth - creativity in using the environment and\nknowledge of various enemies' behavior is required to beat missions on higher\ndifficulty levels. Good part of each battle is won or lost by choosing a\nsuitable configuration of items on your Exos - great for mechwarrior-like\ngame maniacs.\n\nCurrently playing on Expert difficulty and feeling that the enemies are\nsometimes overpowered to the point of absurdity. Dealing with them using normal\nweapons would consume all available ammo long before the level is cleared -\nthere's no weapon with unlimited ammunition. Therefore the player is practically\nforced to use a combination of Overload ability (explode your Exo dealing some\ndamage to yourself and full damage to surroundings) with health regeneration and\ndamage reduction to deal with bots with literally thousands of hit points. The\nammunition, mines and sentry turrets (which also have limited ammo) simply run\nout too fast.\n\nAfter playing almost 50 hours of Bionic Dues I'm looking forward to playing at\nleast another 50. Would also gladly buy more games from Arcen if only they were\navailable on Linux (this particular feature got me to buy Bionic Dues).","December 13, 2013","true","202.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","2"

Reprogram them to fight for you, stealth into melee range, AoE groups, deploy turrets and mines, or good ol fashion guns.\n\n-Different commanders for different playstyles\nAt the beginning of the game you get to choose from 6 different commanders effectively the you in this game. Each one has a special bonus that is different enough that it will change the way you approach the game. Rather than just being a bonus to say shields or damage.\n\nBad:\n\nImpact: The game suffers a complete lack of feedback when damage is concerned. Often time the game will have your current mecha take too much damage and instead of giving you any sort of feedback it's been destroyed the next turn starts and your next mecha is swapped in automatically.\n\nScaling:\nThe game has a terrible sense of scale. Your basic weapons take several hits to destroy an enemy unless you're using your best weapon. Meanwhile enemies frequently destroy your exo in 2 hits easily. This pairs with the problems of impact I listed above.\n\n♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI:\nThe AI literally has defects in this game. Which makes each enemy type follow a specific behavior. This is a fine idea on itself because it gives the player something to exploit, however it's so terribly implemented by having the robots constantly shout things about "Where'd you go?" "No no no, not that way". When they do kill you (And they will) you feel like your death is at the hand of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Also making an enemy that can shoot at any direction in it's large range with OHKO missles and no indication of where it may target is ♥♥♥♥ game design.\n\nSo yeah long story short is the only way I've found to get through this game is by taking AoE and Snipers and just out ranging everything in this game. It's not fun, it's not challenging, it's tedious.\n\nThe game has some interesting idead but they're put together so haphazardly and the game suffers from good feedback and poor balance.\n\n2/10.","October 27, 2015","false","2.1"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

All units move on a grid with a turn based system in place. All units also are equipped with different weapon types that allow robots to attack at many different angles and distances.  The player may control up to 4 robots with 6 different classes to choose from.  The different classes can be upgraded with new weapons and be equipped with varying amounts of new mechanical parts; which act as armor and weapons for your team. The game begins on a map screen where the player can choose which mission type to play. The rewards and challenges are vividly described on the map screen so the player isn’t left in the dark about their objectives. There are many tools available to the player and a single situation often has varying forms of approach. Unfortunately, you will face hundreds of the same enemies while listening to their short list of (mildly) funny dialogue. Thankfully there are many different game variations that can be exercised when choosing your team. The pilot character you choose will decide the unique bonus you have access to during the campaign. These bonuses include conventional advantages like extra lives, to more situational perks like the ability to see objectives (but not the pathways that lead to them.) some of the additional challenges include a randomizer, a mode where the player is only allowed 5 seconds to make an action, and no re-spawns after missions; which are just a few. The soundtrack is extremely well made with energetic tunes that accompany pleasant animations on all the guns and machines.  If you appreciate gameplay variety or a compelling story game look onwards .If tactical decisions and plenty of difficulty modifiers sound appealing; you will find spend many hours in this game.\n","June 27, 2015","true","42.4"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","4","9","0","0"

The guys who took a dump on KB/M users with AVWW 2, and insulted them after they finally gave in and provided "real" mouse support for it.\n\nNow that that PSA is out of the way:\n\nThe game is a little bit like AI War in a single city. Interesting for a while, but it gets repetitive and grindy in all the wrong ways. You'll spend far more time hunting for the "right" upgrades and managing your inventory than engaging in missions.\n\nShort ranged units are at a horrendous disadvantage, given that many rooms are loaded to the brim with enemies with medium to high range weaponry, and the investment needed to make their weapons viable is extreme. A Sniper unit will outperform an Assassin unit 100% of the time. And the game likes to set an Assassin in the default party loadout, and the fact that it also sets two heavy AOE units in the default loadout should be a key warning sign.\n\nOf course, the RNG Gods play a key role in this game, and like the RNG Gods everywhere, they are fickle, arbitrary and hate you.\n\nThe lack of real campaign customization is another drawback, but that is a common issue for Arcen games. Sometimes, it's good to have a real short burst game, and other times, a longer campaign would be more interesting. Sometimes you want to give yourself a moderate challenge in ways that the few selectable "challenges" do not provide.\n\nLet's move on to other parts:\n\nThe audio tracks are taken from AVWW 1. This does not surprise me for some reason, although I must say I'm disappointed, especially since the audio doesn't add to the experience.\n\nGraphics: It's a tiled game. No surprises, no real expectations, although background (or environmental) images would be nice.\n\nAll around, I'm just not able to recommend this game. It's just missing far too many little things, and Arcen has done better in the past.","January 23","false","1.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

Bionic Dues is a rogue-like, top down strategy game from Arcen Games, LLC. Let’s get rocking.\n\nThe Good\n\nIn terms of mastering controls, Bionic Dues is a cinch. There’s no real tutorial for you to play through, but there are tooltips that put up and let you know what’s going on.\n\nThere are A TON of items to customize your mechs with. Seriously, though. Every mission you play you’ll find loot, get awarded with loot (and credits), then head back to the map to visit the store and buy more items with the credits you earned. The amount of content here is staggering.\n\nThe weapons are all quite fun to use. Each one can be applied to have the best results in certain situations. You need to take someone out at long range? Bust out that gamma rifle. You need to waste an entire room of bad guys in one turn or you face certain death? It’s the plasma rifle for you, my friend. (Though, that doesn’t guarantee that you too won’t be caught in the AoE.)\n\nThe Bad\n\nI wasn’t wholly impressed with inventory system. Yes, it’s good to have an obscene amount of content, but you need to implement proper organizational options for it. Your loot starts piling up and, equipping four mechs or not, you will get absolutely drowned in items because the inventory filters are, frankly, garbage. To me, this overwhelming of the player in the customization screen really takes some fun from the game.\n\nThe Meh\n\nYou get four mechs, but you can only use one at a time. Lame.\n\nYou can’t change what weapons your mechs are outfitted with, only what is equipped on said weapons.\n\nThe way the game plays could have been better if it had run on a more traditional turn-based system, I think.\n\nVerdict: Yea\n\nWhen all is said and done, Bionic Dues is a pretty fun game with quite a bit of replay value. If it goes on sale, I’d snag it for sure.","August 14, 2015","true","1.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Tons of parts to compare, with great interactions and specializations.\n- MECHS!  The mecha are interesting, and there are several types, all with their own specialties and uses.\n- Dynamic gameplay.  The missions you choose to do, and your failures or successes, have a limited impact on your final battle.  These choices become more and more important as game difficulty increases.\n\n\nTextures and music aren't the best, and are repetitive.  Minimal story, which is really more of an introduction to the gameplay than an actual tale to be told.  The enemy dialogue is interesting and a bit funny, but it repeats.  The creativity in this one comes from the combination of enemies and goals thrown at you, mixed with what mechs are available and what gear you can find to kit them out.\n\nOverall, Bionic Dues is a very sound purchase for any person who likes to sit down and focus on creative ways to blow things up without arbitrary time limits and/or people shouting at you over a mic.  The kind of single-player game you load up when you are sick of all your gaming friends, and just want to focus on playing a game.","September 6, 2015","true","48.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Each of the six classes has its own strength, which you must keep in mind when you customize using the random equipment you come across.  Some of the gear/build choices are obviously stronger than others, but until you get that gear, you have to make due with what you have.\n\nYou have up to four "characters" in a party that all occupy the same space and move together.  You must swap between them to perform actions such as firing weapons.\n\nMuch of the game involves luring enemies into killing zones and destroying them before they can respond.  One prefered method is to shoot them one by one as they round a corner.  On the standard difficulty settings, this is not terribly hard.\nHowever, there are numerous options to increase the difficulty WITHOUT just making each enemy stupidly strong.  Ammunition becomes a key limiting factor.  You must find ways to efficiently defeat opponents or you will run out.   Trying to conserve your resources is when you are likely to make mistakes.\n\nThere are a variety of enemies.  I think more enemies types and more variety in their AI could have easily made for a deeper game.  However, the amount that is present is sufficient to present an interesting challenge.  There is enough meat here to justify the reasonable price tag.","July 24, 2015","true","119.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The story goes the robots all went nuts and invaded the city, and the only exos that survived the initial attack were yours at the training grounds. Now it's up to you and you alone to stop the bad bots, pretty basic general stuff.\n\nStarting a game you first pick your exo loadout. You have a group of four selected from six varieties plus you select your pilot. During missions you only pilot one exo at a time but you can switch between them at will, a lot like Darkspore. (Side note: This game feels exactly like FTL mixed with Darkspore to me, it's so similar I almost think the devs played both, but since no one else probably played Darkspore I'll end the comparisons there). The six types are a Brawler, short range fighter bot with a shotgun, Assault, jack of all trades bot with grenades and lasers and stronger shields, Sniper, long ranged shooter bot, Ninja, a stealthy bot who uses traps, Siege, a long range aoe powerhouse, and Science, a computer specialist but weak otherwise. You can have duplicates as well like all Assault bots but I don't know why you would. The different pilots also have their own unique abilities like better access to loot in the store or better sensors in missions.\n\nOnce you choose your bots you see the city map. It looks a lot like an FTL map with various missions spread out like leaves on a tree. You can see the mission types available to you and one ring further so you can plan out your moves. Want to access that weapons facility and get some upgraded weapon parts? You might have to fight through a roadblock mission to get there. So there is some randomness there, that's one of the most roguelike features.\n\nOnce in a mission you have particular objectives but they're all pretty similar like blow up this reactor and exit or simply exit the mission without dying. Combat is done turn based but you can move and take turns as quickly as you want using arrow keys so it almost feels realtime, though you can stop at any time to plan your moves. Combat is as simple or as complex as you make it. On easier difficulties you can simply walk up to most robots and blast them. On harder ones you might have to lay down mines and lure them to their death or lure them into the open to snipe them. The missions are procedurally generated so there's some variety there. There's also loot containers in each mission and when you finish a mission you get even more loot depending on how many exos survived the mission.\n\nThe gear is what makes this game so cool but is also a bit of a curse. You can equip the loot drops between missions. There is tons of loot and they all fit different parts of your exo with varied effect. For example one part might fit your weapon and give +50% attack power, or it might give extra range. Another part might fit your shields for a bonus but also give your entire exo +weapon attack power. Different parts also play off each other, like a reactor part produces power and a computer part gives a boost to power generation. Power also acts as a budget to equipping parts. A few choice parts produce power, everything else uses it. You cannot deploy with a negative balance. So balancing your exo can be a bit tricky. To complicate things further there's also hacking points (for opening locked doors in missions), stealth points (a number of actions you can perform while invisible), overload rating (self destruct your reactor slightly damaging you, major damage to enemies), regen rating and more. It can get sticky. On lesser difficulties it's not a big deal. I got so tired of searching for the best setup between missions on easy I'd do 4-5 in a row before checking my gear setup. But on hard this is not possible. You have to equip the best upgrades every mission.\n\nAlso the game is quite long. It takes 50 missions to reach the final battle. Between equipping items and doing mission that could be well over 10 hours for one playthrough. And you can save at any time and reload. So if you're a perfectionist beware, this game can be a major timesink. But the ease of saving also lends itself to a nice casual game. You can jump on, do one mission in 10 minutes and jump off.\n\nThat covers the basics, it really is an astoundingly deep game, but some things do get grindy and repetitive, as is the case with any dungeon crawler style game in my opinion. But in general I found this game addictive and tons of fun.\n\nGraphics: 6/10. This game goes for a retro look but doesn't pull it off nearly as well as FTL. There's also a distinct anime flavor which isn't bad, but in general you can tell this is a mediocre graphic attempt.\n\nMusic: 6/10. Some tracks are good, others really annoying. Obviously this is personal preference, others have raved about the music.\n\nGameplay: 8/10. Really deep tactically. Can get repetitive and tiresome.\n\nValue: 10/10. There's tons to do in this game, tons of achievments, tons of replay value to try different bot/pilot combos. And the base price is only $10, I got it for $2.50 on sale and have over 10 hours already.\n\nOverall: 75/100\n\nI would like to rate this game higher, I really would, cus the things it's good at it is really good at, but there's simply too much grind on hard difficulties to rate this an excellent title. Sadly if you don't spend tons of time min/maxing your exos between missions on hard you won't be successful. I'd rather be strategically fighting than fixing my exo loadout myself. Overall it's just quite good and a super value, nothing wrong with that for a cool indie game.","August 3, 2015","true","18.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The quest for Epic Exos and the countdown to a huge final battle just make it more enticing.\n\nThis title is not for everyone.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheWisdomEye/recommended/238910/","TheWisdomEye","Egen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheWisdomEye/","306 products in account","If you take out all of the human precision and care that goes into crafting a well-balanced tactical game and replace it all with procedurally generated hocus-pocus, you have Bionic Dues, a shining example of how NOT to do a game like this.\n\nFor the sake of this review, I'm going to pretend that there aren't people on Steam who will try to act tough and say that beating a game that generates everything completely at random is based on some sort of "skill" or "good judgment". There's the power of decision making, and then there's just plain ol' being outmatched by a robot that leveled up several times more than your randomly-generated loot chest equipment can possibly hope to combat.\n\nNo, there's good decision making, and then there's numbers. Tactical games have always been about numbers. They have always been about well-crafted maps with careful enemy placement as much as they have been about intelligent team setup supported by guaranteed available items in shops (because the game knows you will need them). Bionic Dues does none of this. Bionic Dues generates all of the maps and the enemies that are placed into them with a computer algorithm. It generates which combinations of enemies will be in a map with a computer algorithm. It generates what level those enemies will be with a computer algorithm. Need to outfit your team in order to survive? Too bad. Bionic Dues also generates the items available in the shop with a computer algorithm. Basically, EVERYTHING is generated almost entirely at random. And as much as I'd like to believe that the computer procedures used in the generation of everything in this game are as intelligent and discerning as a human being... they're not.\n\nIf you like to sit at a table and roll dice over and over again until you get a certain number, this game might be for you. Yeah, sure, delude yourself into thinking that there is some kind of decision you can make that will mystically cause your severely under-equipped robot to beat a hulking level 7 DoomBot - it seems to be what "roguelike" fans tend to do so they can convince themselves that everything they accomplished in a playthrough was totally the product of their skill. Is this game possible? Sure. I'm just so not afraid to say it straight: this game is absurdly random. It is a total crapshoot what items I will get, meaning it's a total crapshoot how powerful I will be, and it's a total crapshoot how the enemies will level up, meaning it's a total crapshoot whether or not I will beat them. The game is a total crapshoot. But like I said, some people like sitting at a table rolling dice over and over again until they get a certain number. Some people like crap(s).\n\nP.S. Please, really don't try to say that this review is because I can't handle the game. I've beaten the game 3 times on Expert and destroyed 100 enemies in a single shot. That is so not the issue. Only somebody extremely near-sighted bases their opinions on whether or not they can beat a game. This game is not good. It is an awful representation of tactical games. The tactical game genre should be ashamed of this game, it's giving the genre a bad name.","June 18, 2014","false","21.9"," 21 of 44 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","21","44","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/eternal_oblivion/recommended/238910/","eternal_oblivion","Eternal Oblivion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/eternal_oblivion/","115 products in account","This game contains the hardest dilemma you'll ever face on a videogame: Which character will I pick?\n\n-The black girl with a tiny head\n-The blonde with a tumor on her face\n-The fugly nerdy girl\n-The scarred guy with a giraffe neck\n-The gaysian\n-The black guy with lipstick\n\nI don't know much about the gameplay, tried a couple of levels on "normal" mode, and got myself wrecked (mostly by Insta-kill bots, Allahu-Akhbots, halls filled with mines with no other way to go around them, and the list goes on). Maybe I lost some important info in one of the text walls that the game calls 'tutorials'.\n\nBut what really annoys me is the art. I guess this was the best they could afford - a guy that has some crappy aesthetic sense, and can't make proportional human-like figures.\n\nBy the way, I picked the black guy with lipstick.\n\n*Edit: ------FUN PART OF REVIEW ENDS HERE------ Wall of text below.\n\nDue to extensive criticism, I decided to be a bit more detailed on aspects regarding gameplay.\n\n1. Some screenshots can be pretty misleading. To clarify this, in this game you control a single unit, that alternates between what some people may call "stances". However, the game likes to say that these stances are actually, individual mechs. Moving on - there's the assault stance mech (the one that shoots), the siege mech (the one that deals area damage), the ninja mech (the one that hides), and the science mech (the one that opens doors and hacks stuff). Note, however, that the assault can still do some AoE like the siege, and hide like the ninja, but not quite as effective.\n\n2. The game is heavily based on RNG. Traps, enemies and drops are generated and spawned by a computer algorithm, meaning that your outcome on a mission can be pretty much decided by a roll of dice. You may find a bunch of chests, filled with nice loot the same way you can find a narrow hallway filled with mines. That leaves no space for skill-based (or, in this case, smarts-based?) gameplay, just frustration and unfair situations.\n\n3. As I already said, presentation is horrible (and yes, I'm still regarding gameplay here). Not just the art is badly drawn, but the menus are also dreadful. At some point, you'll have to deal with your inventory, that will be filled with items that you got during your missions (woah, a bunch of loot! cool! ... right?). Trying to sort your stash, and figure out which item will fit best to which mech rapidly becomes a tedious task, the more items you get.\n\nSo... yeah, that's all, folks.","October 16, 2015","false","3.2"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","43","6","14","2","0"

One giant thing that I love about the game is how easy it is to pick up for a beginner.  I have never played a game about this before, and it only took about 10 mins to get started and in the game. I am having a load of fun. Also, it runs on Linux, which is really nice.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SKnightshade/recommended/238910/","SKnightshade","Knightshade","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SKnightshade/","260 products in account","Bionic Dues is another game by Arcen Games, and it features many similar elements as their most popular series- AI War Fleet Command- AI Rebellion, weakened humanity, difficult/punishing gameplay, sharp difficulty curve, slow paced thoughtful gameplay, occasional oversights in the tutorials due to game mechanics.\n\nHowever, where AI War was a strategy game involving often absurd numbers of ships, in extreme cases numbering in the tens of thousands, Bionic Dues is a much smaller game. The city map is randomly generated, as are the actual maps from what I can tell. The abilities and variation between the various "Exos" the player can pilot are both interesting and well definied, with each having a 'niche' that is generally obvious (brawling, assault, sniper, hacking, etc), but with smaller 'modules' that allow you to customize each "Exo" to fit your own playstyle. The difficulty ramps up rather well, but I've found on lower difficulties its easy to become slightly overpowered. Individual variation between mission types helps keep the game from getting repetitive, as do various "Pilots" you can select from the beginning that give you a bonus that will significantly effect the nature of your play. (One gets bonuses for the shopkeepers, one starts out with epic units, one has the ability to pursue missions futher away, etc.)\n\nThe game is not without flaws. It has the Mass Effect problem where every mission gives you loot for surviving units, and most missions have hackable doors and lootable cans, making keeping track of modules, especially late game, a bit of a pain in the ♥♥♥. It also occasionally becomes too open, with a lack of really clearly defined goals besides "upgrade your equipment and survive the invasion in 40 days".\n\nThe soundtrack is mostly rehashed from AI War, with a few new introductions. It fits the game well, but players looking for a new album by Pablo Vega may be disappointed.\n\nI feel a need to point out that the turn based element is one I particularly like. Preforming any action costs a turn (moving, shooting most weapons, hacking, etc.), and then the robots will each move. However, Bionic Dues has no request prompts, so if you simply want to run across the map you can do so in realtime, but you can simply step away from the keyboard at any point if you wish and the game will wait for you. It allows you to pick your own pacing- Will you run in blasting anything that moves as the robots charge you down? Maybe you'll sit back and analyze each robot and pick the most efficient attack pattern, or maybe throw down an ambush using automated defenses, mines, or an enemy you hacked into being on your side.\n\nIf you don't like replaying games trying to work different mechanics, Bionic Dues may not be for you. Those looking for a well developed story will find very little of that here (lots of setting, but the plot is something you make yourself).\n\nIn any case, I happily recommend Bionic Dues.","February 3, 2015","true","20.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you're looking for a little bit of turn-based strategy in your Rogue-like RPG, Bionic Dues will fill that need. Just keep in mind that the game can be very convoluted in the way it presents your goals: your ultimate goal is to upgrade and survive for a pre-determined number of turns before the machines make their final assault on your base. The missions you engage in will determine how strong (or weak) the robot horde is when the final defense occurs. The game can be cleared in a few hours on normal difficulty; the real challenge comes from the harder modes and playing with different loadouts of robotic exos and commander units. The asking price of $10 is more than fair for a game with this level of replayability, so long as you're willing to put in the time to learn the nuance of the rules at play. Even if you aren't, consider buying Bionic Dues on sale if you enjoy more traditional Rogue-like titles.","February 20, 2014","true","8.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Apart from that, soundtrack on its own is worth what they ask for the game, making it almost a theft and a no-brainer for all everyone fond of turn-based strategy games.","February 27, 2014","true","9.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At times, the gameplay will feel a bit off since you're gonna be reacting to the enemies' movement and provoking them, rather than just diving in and killing everything like in most games. Still, that's just a tiny part of the actual playtime, and the music is simply amazing, so it fills up the little downtimes you may have.\n\nTalking about the music, it's so amazing that whenever I stop playing, I always feel like the current track is slightly out of context (especially menu song)... Yet, all of them are so melodious and non-intrusive that it only ends up as a positive experience overall (I've had the menu song loop for ~30 minutes right now...)\n\nSo, let's see if you should buy this game or not... What this game offers :\n\n- Squad management : You control 1 character, but can swap between 4 exos. The first thing you do when you create a game is choose your "avatar" (aka 1 special game-changing skill), and 4 exos which have their own specialties.\n- Equipment management : Each mecha has a reactor, shield, propulsor, computer and 2-5 weapons. Each of those have 2-4(5?) slots for items. You have to mix multiple stats while managing power usage to create your indestructible monsters.\n- Tactical fight : Lay down mines and turrets, go stealthed to "charm" their leader and run away sneakily, Use your shotgun to explode the fuel tank and make everything i nthat room ashes... This game offers it all. I haven't tried the 2 hardest difficulties yet, but the tactical side may even make the game slightly too easy.\n- Amazing music : I said it already, saying it again, the OST is  at the very least charming. Not a single time did I thought "Hmm... I should lower the sound!". Screw you roomies, I'm playing Bionic Dues!\n- Randomness : Map layout where you pick missions is random, map layout of missions is random, item drops are random... There are a few other aspect that are random-ish, but all in all you have the Rogue-like randomness without it being too punishing.\n- Different difficulties : I just completed a game on normal hardcore, it felt easy for someone used to play roguelikes. There are 2 difficulties lower than that, which are aptly named easy and casual, and 2 higher, which should be interesting.\n\nAll in all, the choice is easy... If you like Mechas, buy it! If you like roguelikes, buy it! If the game is on sale, buy it! (Honestly, even if you're not a big fan of such games, I'm 100% you'll get more than $5-7 worth of fun out of this game).","February 14, 2014","true","22.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In Bionic Dues you control a squad of four 'exos' (remotely piloted mechs) one at a time to stop the advancing robot menace.  The game features random loot, as popularized by Diablo, an overall strategy screen, and the tactical map where all the robot stomping happens.  You have 50 days (turns) to prosecute a campaign against the tide of robots trying to eradicate humanity.  Each day you choose an available mission for your exos from those shown on teh city map.  After 50 days the remaining mass of robots arrive on your doorstep, and you have to KILL THEM ALL!\n\nFor the most part the robots themselves, and the AI controlling them, are pretty dumb.  The 'bots try to crush your puny human resistance through sheer numbers, rather than any sort of awesome tactical genius.  On a similar note, though, there isn't much randomness to the combat itself.  You never feel cheated because your stupid exo managed to miss several shots in a row, or because you didn't realize that 'bot could shoot you.  All the info you need to make good decisions is right there on the screen.\n\nAudio and music are competent.  Everything sounds pew-pew and rata-tata as you'd expect.  The music isn't the sort of thing I'd listen to in the car, but I enjoy it enough to listen to it as I play.\n\nGraphics are clear enough that you can understand what's going on, but not spectacular.  It's 2D, top-down, tactical game, so a step up from pixel graphics, but you can't really admire the robot models, because there aren't any.\n\nThe game isn't quite the same tactical depth of FTL, but your exos have a lot of options available to them.  Equipping them with loot is almost its own mini-game, and you will see a LOT of loot over the course of the game.  The biggest complaint I had of my first game was that the 'bots were a pushover.  I felt like I was moshing 'bots with impunity after only 20 turns or so, and by turn 40 I just wanted it to be over because I was so thoroughly dominating them.  That first game took 17 hrs to finish.  There are a decent amount of options for replayability, with six different commanders and exo types (each game you have a single commander, and up to four different exos).\n\nI enjoy turn-based tactics games like this, so it was worth the ten bucks I spent.  Definitely worth it if you can get it on sale.","May 18, 2015","true","26.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SKnightshade/recommended/238910/","SKnightshade","Knightshade","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SKnightshade/","260 products in account","Bionic Dues is another game by Arcen Games, and it features many similar elements as their most popular series- AI War Fleet Command- AI Rebellion, weakened humanity, difficult/punishing gameplay, sharp difficulty curve, slow paced thoughtful gameplay, occasional oversights in the tutorials due to game mechanics.\n\nHowever, where AI War was a strategy game involving often absurd numbers of ships, in extreme cases numbering in the tens of thousands, Bionic Dues is a much smaller game. The city map is randomly generated, as are the actual maps from what I can tell. The abilities and variation between the various "Exos" the player can pilot are both interesting and well definied, with each having a 'niche' that is generally obvious (brawling, assault, sniper, hacking, etc), but with smaller 'modules' that allow you to customize each "Exo" to fit your own playstyle. The difficulty ramps up rather well, but I've found on lower difficulties its easy to become slightly overpowered. Individual variation between mission types helps keep the game from getting repetitive, as do various "Pilots" you can select from the beginning that give you a bonus that will significantly effect the nature of your play. (One gets bonuses for the shopkeepers, one starts out with epic units, one has the ability to pursue missions futher away, etc.)\n\nThe game is not without flaws. It has the Mass Effect problem where every mission gives you loot for surviving units, and most missions have hackable doors and lootable cans, making keeping track of modules, especially late game, a bit of a pain in the ♥♥♥. It also occasionally becomes too open, with a lack of really clearly defined goals besides "upgrade your equipment and survive the invasion in 40 days".\n\nThe soundtrack is mostly rehashed from AI War, with a few new introductions. It fits the game well, but players looking for a new album by Pablo Vega may be disappointed.\n\nI feel a need to point out that the turn based element is one I particularly like. Preforming any action costs a turn (moving, shooting most weapons, hacking, etc.), and then the robots will each move. However, Bionic Dues has no request prompts, so if you simply want to run across the map you can do so in realtime, but you can simply step away from the keyboard at any point if you wish and the game will wait for you. It allows you to pick your own pacing- Will you run in blasting anything that moves as the robots charge you down? Maybe you'll sit back and analyze each robot and pick the most efficient attack pattern, or maybe throw down an ambush using automated defenses, mines, or an enemy you hacked into being on your side.\n\nIf you don't like replaying games trying to work different mechanics, Bionic Dues may not be for you. Those looking for a well developed story will find very little of that here (lots of setting, but the plot is something you make yourself).\n\nIn any case, I happily recommend Bionic Dues.","February 3, 2015","true","20.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's got a great foundation - you have different weapons, you have upgrade parts that modifies numbers, you have a genuine feeling that you are a robot going around blowing stuff up - but it's lacking depth somewhat. It requires SOME tactics, but it could really do with more.\n\nSo it's good casual fun, but just don't expect a thinking man's game out of it.","July 13, 2014","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The robots will attack you and you have 50 days to prepare.

It's turn based, but play moves very quickly. One action of any type is a turn, so it plays out more like a semi-realtime game.\n\nThe mechanics seem a little bewildering at first and the lack of a real tutorial puts the barrier to entry a little higher than many people will be able to handle. If you can get past that and spend a mission or two figuring out how it all works, there's a fantastic strategy title here.","October 28, 2015","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Strategy and logic.\n\nAs you move enemies move as well, some will attempt to attack you while others may move on a predetermined route. Use the environment to your advantage, while some obstacles may hinder your vision it also hinders the enemies vision. I feel like the movement and combat was partially enspired by another game called Legend of Grimrock.\n\nThe fact that this game has voiceovers was suprising, especially the voiceovers for the enemy bots (Which by the way is actually pretty funny). As you shoot the bots (and they miss their shots at you) they let off some pretty humerous lines like "Why was I programmed to feel pain?!" or "Stupid GPS...".\n\nGraphics aren't really the focus here as the game is entirely 2 dimensional however the art style is pleasant on the eyes.\n\nAll in all here's the conclusion:\n8/10 Would definately recomend this to casual gamers.","February 21","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a roguelite that is actually pretty close to the rogue formula all things considered. The art style is not entirely appealing sometimes, but overall I dig it. The strategy layer is engaging, though not super deep. The combat is super satisfying. I started on casual so that I could get the hang of things and avoid the burnout that seems to happen to lots of people. That worked out great, but casual got really easy really fast. It's better than when I started on normal and got absolutely murdered since I had no idea what I was doing.\n\nI do recommend. Maybe highly.

The robots will attack you and you have 50 days to prepare. You can do a variety of missions to collect gear or weaken the enemy. 1 mission equals 1 day. 1 full playthrough of 50 days took me about 10 hours.\n\nPros:\n\n-There's a lot of costumization: 6 different exos to choose from each of them with their own strengths and weaknesses and lots of gear to choose from.\n-Large enemy variety, every sort of enemy needs to be dealt with in a different way.\n-Some strategic choice in choosing missions.\n-1 mission for each of your 4 exos that upgrades it with extra weapons.\n-Missions themselves have a lot of tactical depth thanks to having 4 different exos available each with 2-6 mostly different weapons.\n-Lots of replayability if you like the combat system: each mission feels different thanks to procedurally-generated levels.\n-Missions are short (15 mins) so you can play when you don't have a lot of time.\n-I personally really like the soundtrack.\n\nCons:\n\n-Lots of different types of missions with different win conditions, but most of them feel the same because they all require you to kill most of the enemies in a level.\n-Can get repetitive if you're not a fan of the combat system: you'll be doing basically the same thing with the same 4 exos 50 times until the end of the game.\n-The way achievements work is a bit silly: same achievement for every difficulty level.","December 24, 2015","true","12.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/skel1/recommended/238910/","skel1","Skel1","http://steamcommunity.com/id/skel1/","526 products in account","This is a mech based TBS RPG game and follows pretty standard formulas for the genre. Pimp your mechs out in between missions with energy weapons, guns, or explosives, and upgrade their non combat systems like power, propulsion, and computer.  During missions take turns battling it out similar to xcom, fallout tactics, etc.  If you're a fan of all three of these genres you will most likely enjoy this game. It should be noted that you only control one mech (called an exo) at a time.\n\nThe difficulty is good if not a bit roguelike. It's often to be be killed in one shot by an enemy. Fortunately there is save loading.  The stat and gear building is enjoyable but a little drab. The game favors giving you junk gear to sell rather than money directly so it takes some time sorting through.\n\nI received this game for free, but I enjoyed it. If it's on sale it's a shoe in, otherwise it depends how much you like random turn based dungeon crawls with mechs.","January 23","true","25.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
