Then I saw it. What a time to be alive. If I threw my credit card any faster at the screen it could've been considered a shuriken. I played Estvial Versus on my YouTube channel which you can see here. So when I saw it was Shinovi Versus I was all over that ♥♥♥♥.\n\nShinovi Versus was the prelude to Estival Versus and PS Vita only so obviously this is a PS Vita port. So with that comes the following:\n\nPros:\n- Plays and runs incredibly. I dare say it even feels way better than Estival Versus on PS4\n- Your attacks actually feel like they have impact and weight compared to EV\n- All DLC included (but worked into game as purchasable unlocks with in-game currency)\n- Its Senran Kagura on steam and doesn’t run like ♥♥♥♥\n- Keeps the online mode from the original\n\nCons:\n- Aside from the 60fps the game looks exactly like you would expect an upscaled Vita game to look like\n- It's not free?\n\nSeriously ignoring the flaws with the models and textures this game is all the oppai goodness you expect from Senran Kagura. Hide your kids hide your wife stap in and game on. More plot than most AAA titles right now (regardless of your definition of plot). Girls of every type for every occasion (or make your own in the dressing room). 99 pairs of pantsu to unlock. If your friends don't approve you need better friends, no one needs that negativity in their lives. Great one handed gaming practice. A dressing room with a better selection than your average Victoria's Secret. Super attacks that let you go for the T or A depending on your preference. Katsuragis relationship with oppai is still a better love story than Twilight. It's the game you didn’t know you needed. Bought 4 copies so the devs will consider bringing Estival Versus to steam.","June 2","true","1.6"," 79 of 89 people (89%) found this review helpful 53 people found this review funny","89","79","89","53","4"

To see it available on Steam surprises me as much as excites.\n\nTo be honest? I'm biased. As a woman that finds most Japanese animation to be bland at best I... genuinely adore this game. I really, really do. It's not often that video games drift into the realm of exploitation; rarer still if they're done right, and with gameplay competent enough to drive my interest further.\n\nAnd so one of my most cherished Vita exclusives comes to PC. How does it fair on the platform?\n\nDecently. This is a no-frills port job; visual settings beyond resolution and window type are non-existent. Playing natively outside of the Vita's 960x544 pixel touchscreen? It's convenient, but at the cost of exposing Senran Kagura's handheld roots in the most obvious way possible.\n\nThe framerate is, of course, massively improved via brute force. Between the jiggle physics and sheer amount of action on-screen, this was a demanding little game for the Vita; drops from the 30 FPS lock weren't uncommon. If there's an absolute definite improvement with the jump to PC, this would be at the top of the list.\n\nThen there's the inclusion of all DLC as a standard feature; it's a gesture most appreciated, completionist or not. I am, however, saddened by the lack of a digitized soundtrack and artbook, both impressive additions to the physical Vita edition and most certainly missed with this conversion.\n\nYou know what else I miss? The usage of the Vita's more obtuse features. There was a genuine novelty in 'tearing' your chosen shinobi's clothing off via the touchscreen, or blowing into the mic for a Marilyn Monroe moment while playing dress-up. Most would consider these as mere gimmicks, sure, but for a game like Senran Kagura, I can't help but feel that some of the charm was lost in the translation.\n\nStill, this is a pretty close second if a Vita is simply out of the question, and that's something commendable in its own right.","June 4","true","1.2"," 43 of 50 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","43","50","2","3"

That's more like the icing on the cake here...\n\nSenran Kagura Shinovi Versus is a beat-em-up game that features (at the start of the game) 12 playable characters, and a lot of character customization options (Sadly, can't change weapons). One part of the character customization, is the ability to place your choice of accessory anywhere on your character. This means if you're one of those weird kids who thought about placing cat ears on your character's ♥♥♥, you can do that.\n\nCombat is pretty standard. You fight with the same basic combinations, eventually leveling up and obtaining new abilities. There are 3 different "forms" to take within battle. You start in your first form, and then you either transform into a special outfit with new attacks, or... rip off your original clothes down to your bra and panties for a different form. Each form gains experience from fighting in it during missions, and once you transform into one of the other two forms, you can not change back until the end of the battle.\n\nThe characters also have 2 different special attacks that can be used when changed into any of the other forms (not the starting form!) by using some points from the skill bar. Each character has a different set of special attacks.\n\nNew outfits, accessories, and hairstyles can be bought in the game's store with currency obtained from completing missions or story quests. They even allow you to zoom to see your characters in detail, and you can inapropriately touch them pet them using the right mouse button. DLC items are already available and are not a separate purchase.\n\nWithin battle, if you apply enough consistent damage to a boss character (essentially any character you can actually play as), articles of clothing can start to tear apart from the opponent. If the player finishes off a boss character with a special move, while the boss character only has their undergarmets left, they can completely lose their bra or panties at the end of the battle. It even sticks around in the following cutscene if the cutscene shows the character models.\n\nThis game supports online multiplayer! (Developing)...\n\nPerformance wise, I was running the game on an Intel i7 4790K, 16GB DDR3 Ram, and a GTX 1080. Now despite this being overkill for a game like this, I can say I've had no issue running this game in 1080p borderless windowed mode (However the window stretches to my entire screen resolution of 1440p, so am I running it in 1440p?). Throughout my initial playthrough of the game of 4 hours, I've only experienced a really crazy slowdown mid-gameplay, where my FPS dropped to the low 5s for some strange reason, even caused my own computer to lag. After a system reboot, I have yet to encounter this issue again.\n\nOther than that, I did have these 3 minor issues:\nCharacter models, when shown in cutscenes seem to randomly shake a bit.\nSimilar to the above issue, this also sometimes happens in combat.\nThe lack of any kind of Anti-Aliasing on the character's shadow is a bit distracting, but does not affect gameplay.\n\nI have been waiting for quite a while for this game to come to PC, and now that it has, I'm a happy camper.\nNow just give us Estial Versus, please XSeed/Marvelous.","June 1","true","8.0"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","20","24","3","0"

It has a very light hearted plot for most of the school's storylines except for the few times where it becomes sad/dark. If you play it for longer than ~1hr at a time you might start to feel a little bored, but if you just play in small chunks every once in a while you'll have a blast. There is also a ♥♥♥♥♥on of fanservice in the game. I'd suggest using a controller for playing this. Also all of the DLC (about $60 worth of costumes and accessories, as well as two characters who have their own individual stories) included for free, you just have to buy it in the ingame shop with money you get at the end of each mission, which piles up really fast.\nThis is a solid 7.5/10 game and I'd highly recommend it if you enjoy action games, beat em ups, and stripping clothes off of high scool aged girls.","June 1","true","5.4"," 27 of 37 people (73%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","73","27","37","3","0"

Buts.\n\nA Vita port of an ecchi game sounds like an awful idea, BUT against all odds, it is actually pretty good. It's not quite DOA levels of whoa-this-is-a-really-legit-game, BUT it comes close.\n\nIt's not going to blow anyone away, but the fighting mechanics are solid and varied just enough to keep you entertained. The story and characters start pretty one-dimensional and fanservice-focused, but for some bizarre reason things get grim and actually kind of interesting after two or so hours. This could've easily been a mindless mess with terrible gameplay, but you could play this and have fun in more ways than just sexy kinds. It even has okay online, so you can beat up friends. As long as your friends are all pervs, anyway.\n\nNothing about it is perfect, of course; the masses of small enemies are repetitive to fight and are actually really tedious as some characters, and they just serve to pad play time before you get to the real one-on-one or two-on-two fights. Some of the less serious dialogues are at best annoying and at worst genuinely uncomfortable, even for someone who's already on board for the sexy stuff. Being a Vita port, you don't get many settings, and the animations don't look good on a larger screen. It basically all feels one step up from a doujin game, BUT I've still managed to spend hours in the Vita version and now this one.\n\nAlso, there's no real overt porn. Like, no sex scenes, no getting a boyfriend, no real mentions of sex at all. It's just girls in skimpy outfits jiggling and occasionally making cutesy gay comments to one another. It treats itself like a game about ninjas killing each other, even if it relies heavily on T&A.\n\nSo basically, it's one of the better ways to get off, and you even get to play a game and hear a story with it. Plus, it comes with the DLC characters and ALL the outfits.","June 5","true","3.6"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","16","18","2","0"

I didn't expect to enjoy the combat as\nmuch as I did.  It actually plays, looks, and sounds great.\n\nTL:DR COMPLETE --- Full Review Below ---\n\n\nGraphics:  Didn't get a clock on the FPS, but the game runs pretty well.  Didn't see much issue.\nThe animation is fluid and crisp, and there is an array of character designs with many options\nfor customization at your finger tips.\nOver all 8/10, could be higher with a little more detail but glad they didn't, game runs great.\n\nSound: The Music is nice, and each area has its own theme.  You can adjust the sliders for\nMusic, SFX, and Voice to your taste if any one gets on your nerves over time.  But for me,\nI am a purist, I usually want the in game music and sound fx experience.  But there are sliders\nfor those that care.  The sound fx seems legit, and nothing coms to mind as standing out,\nwhich is usually a good sign.  The voice overs are well done.  For the life of me I wish\nI knew WTF they were saying.  Sure there is Text on the screen, but you don't have time to\nread it while you are doing the boss fights usually.  However, it is top notch stuff, just like\nany of the Anime's that you can think of that were not English dubbed.   Although I do like\nthe real voice actors, I am one of those types that do also enjoy some localization, and so\nI am going to go with:\n7/10 for Sound, its great, no problems, but would of liked some English, but it doesn't hurt the game.\n\nGameplay:  This is where I was most surprised.  The combat system is RPG like, so you progress with new abilities as you get better.  And you do get XP when you lose too, just not very much. But this can help you not lose hope on a tough boss when you are just trying to figure out the game. This game is heavy on trying to keep the combo meter on the rise, so you really have to have spatial awareness and this can be hard in a game with camera controls like this.  However, this is a lockon system that will help you out if you find yourself having trouble.  Each character has their own fighting style that varies in look and feel.  And there is the Shinobi Transformation system that is reallypretty much the icing on the cake for this game.  It's all fan service, but it actually has a reason to exist in the game.  You see, somehow your clothes make you stronger, so as you fight, you might have them get shreaded a bit and you get weaker.  So this is where the Shinobi Transformation comes into play, as you get a fresh new outfit that also makes you stronger than your default self.  And on top of that, after you transform you can do Secret Ninja Art attacks that can turn the tide of battle pretty fast.  And each character gets 2 different types of these.  And there is a block system, and a counter system, which if timed right helps recharge your transformations.  There is tons of ariel / warp to enemy finish attacks to enjoy.  And if all else fails, you can do this one move to rip your own clothes to rampage a bit and gain attack while losing defense, so that is something else you can do if you like.  As far the RPG elements, it seems there are 3 branches and you get gains in them by doing skills that are in that branch.  So it follows on of my fav. RPG gain systems, which is use a skill and you gain skill in that skill, it just makes more sense than level up and spend points at will to me.  So:\nI give it a 8/10 on gameplay, as it seems to have some replay value, and there is PvP Online if you want to do that.\n\nGoing to wrap it up now, don't have much more to say, so final conclusion is:\n\n8/10 -  Good Game.  Get if/when you can.  You don't have to wait for a sale, its good.  But if its too high, which it is a bit, wait.  But I heard since it comes with all the DLC, on the other system it was like $120 bucks with everything, so in a way this is a deal.  Enjoy!","June 4","true","9.4"," 46 of 74 people (62%) found this review helpful 28 people found this review funny","62","46","74","28","9"

Here's my opinion:\n\nDifficultyThe difficulty is leaning toward casual game. There is no huge learning curve to get into. You can enjoy Solo Missions right away. You can button mashing your way through the missions, even on some Hard difficulty one, with the uses of dashing around (provided that you timed your action right), though, those mashing can still easily K.O.ed you during boss fights.\n\nHowever, I am positive that you will be fighting more tactical with all the abilities provided, as you get used to the gameplay. (less button mashing)\n\nGameplayThe SKSV is mostly compared to Musou (Warriors) series by many, however, In my opinion, it is not. It is more into the melee side, not just another brawler.\n\nYou will be focusing on the actions, beating up enemies. The map is small, closed arena with some corridors in some missions.\n\nYou can block, timed parry, shinobi sprint, dash, air dash, mid-air chase, light atk, heavy atk, charged atk, special atk, form change or even do a move-cancel to gain advantage of certain situations. Dueling is the closest thing I can think of. It is just that missions often come with numbers of lesser enemies to beat up, before the bosses. Not just spamming atk when enemies are in vulnerable states, as in the Warriors series.\n\nThere are 22 characters for you to control. Some of them share similar functions, however, no 2 characters are performed the same way, so you get total of 22 uniques to play with, which is a plus for me.\n\nCharacters' CustomizationYes, this feature deserves its own heading. This feature is the cosmetic only, no gameplay change, but for anime lovers, this level of thing is more than welcome.\n\nYou can change 3 costumes, which is your 3 forms appeared in-game, 1 hairstyle, and 5 items to put on each character. Each item can be move, rotate, and resize, so if you want to put a mask on the hip, you can.\n\nSurprisingly, they will wear your custom costumes during dialogues/missions they appeared in too.\n\nExample:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=697070878\n\nPerformanceThe port has been done nicely, very much acceptable for my standard.\n\nIt lacks the detailed settings for PC game's standard, but imo, there is no need for it as SKSV is not AAA tittle with AAA visual/fx, where you need to fine tuning the settings for smooth gameplay. Things are not in the super HD quality, but I see improvements over the original.\n\nThe game runs at 1080p with quite stable 60fps for my mid-tier PC.\n\nTL;DRSKSV is a good game, and worth my purchase at reasonable price. (one of a few game that I don't refund to wait for more discounts) Fan-services are the plus for me, apart from its casual fun, but can be challenging at times, gameplay. The online modes are interesting, and there is AI available for those too.\n\nHere are some gameplay.\n\nMenus and Tutorials\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=695605395\n\nEarly Gameplay\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=695904644\n\nI am looking forward to see Senran Kagura Estival Versus here soon.

While Deep Crimson has Shinovi Versus beat in terms of gameplay, this version is very worthwhile. if you have already played the 3DS games, SV boasts a great variety of characters, side stories for each character that expands on the her personality and charm, and lots of customization. But it can also work as one's first Senran Kagura, as it explains all you need to know from the Burst installment.\n\nIf you are not familiar with the franchise, no, this is not only about buxom ladies ! At the end of the day, the clothes ripping is more a gimmick than the actual heart of the games. Think more along the lines of an action comedy anime with actual combat gameplay, where silly high school girls fool around in a surprisingly cruel ninja world. The clash of styles can be charming, and the gameplay is fun, if a bit hard to master if you're used to, say, dynasty warriors.","June 3","true","8.7"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

The game is alright, the combat isnt something that has a lot of depth and it isnt very balanced when going up against the a.i.(you can spam your special moves as much as you want so long as you have the scrolls needed, these attacks are basically a cutscene that plays that leads into an actual attack).\n\nThis is ultimately a game you buy for the dress up aspect along with loading it up every now and then to play some fun fights out. in terms of content available its mainly just 3 different stories (edit: a fourth one is available for unlock, I just remembered, sorry.) that involve you going through a path filled with ninja girls to reach a playable character that acts as a boss, the other content is just some quick personal stories of every girl and all the dresses and panties you can get to play dress up. multiplayer can be very fun and it comes with bots if its the same as the vita versions. All in all this game is probably 25 hours of content to play through and after that it becomes an occasional beat em up you load up to have some fun. There is level progression in this game as well and some things to be unlocked, so after a while your characters may seem very op on lower difficulties,\n\nI really do suggest this game as it\'s one of my favourite beat em ups in the past 5 years.\n\n\nLast note, it runs very well compared to the vita versions where fps drops where common.","June 1","true","0.4"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

After you get past the "10/10 boobs xD" stuff you'll find a really solid beat em' up, with a ton of characters and great customisation. The story is nothing to write home about and the missions really boil down to beating a bunch of generic enemies before a boss. It's super similar to Dynasty Warriors for example due to the large ammounts of enemies on screen.\n\nTo spice up the gameplay a bit you have 2 diffrent transformations, that alter your moves and stats (and outfit), and grant you acces to the op af super attacks, wich shred the opponents clothes. The core gameplay is really fun, alltough a bit buttonmashy at times.\n\nThere is no shortage of content here. You get 4 story campaings for each faction in the game and individual storylines for each character. The mission structure is almost identical in both modes, but there is plenty of content here for your money. (this is not even counting the multiplayer wich works fine)\n\nI am pleasantly suprised how they handled the PC port of this game. Having played this on the PS Vita, the 60fps helps this game tremendously, since the framerate doesn't ♥♥♥♥ the bed due to the enemies on screen. Combat also feels way more fluid and faster, making the already fun combat way more fun. It could have used more advanced graphics settigns, but im willing to forgive that concidering this used to be a handheld game.\n\nOverral i would suggest giving the game a shot, especially if you are a fan of dumb anime ♥♥♥♥ and musou games in particular.

This review focuses more on the technical side of things.\n\nFor comparison, here's my specs:\n\nCPU: Intel Core i5 750 @ 2.66GHz\nRAM: 6GB DDR3\nGPU: Sapphire Radeon R9 280X\n\nNow, the required specs on the store page made it out as if I'd have a hard time playing it, mostly due to RAM and CPU. This is not the case at all. I run it windowed at 1600X900, and it plays flawlessly. No issues performance-wise.\n\nHowever, I have encountered 2 large bugs in it. First, I cannot rebind keys. The options screen shows the new binding, but the program refuses to honor it, still using the default binding. Despite that, the controller does work just fine, so it's still more than playable. Secondly, The audio is not balanced well, or consistently. Hanzo's voice in the cutscenes was almost inaudible. However in other places I could hear it just fine. On the other hand, the gun-sound Yozakura's gauntlets make are completely unaffected by volume options, and play at 100% volume no matter what, causing a deafening bang.\n\nIf or when those bugs are fixed, this game will be perfectly solid. The game runs well, it's even more responsive than the Vita version from running at 60FPS, it's gorgeous at higher resolutions, and it comes with all DLC. On top of that, they seem to have rebalanced things so you unlock outfits and such a little differently to compensate.

At first the game wouldn't launch. I saw Steam pop up a message box saying that it was launching the game, and then... nothing. Tried again. Nothing. So here's what I did to fix the issue:\n\nI right-clicked the game in the game list in my library.\nI chose "Browse Local Files"\nI ran the game executable, titled "Application" directly from the install folder.\nThe game told me it was missing "MSVCR110.dll". This is part of the Microsoft Visual C++ runtime.\nI went to https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30679 and downloaded the 32-bit runtime "vcredist_x86.exe".\nI installed the runtime.\nI ran "Application" from the install folder again, got "Failed to start game".\nI ran the game from within Steam this time and it started right up.\n\nApparently Steam doesn't include the C++ runtime with the game. Note that I just did a fresh install of Win 10 the other day, so most likely other people will already have this file from something else they installed. Hope this helps.","June 4","true","2.7"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","79","11","14","5","0"

I'm sure looking at other reviews or trailers of this game you can decide for yourself if this is a game you would enjoy.\n\nFor those of you who don't know, Senran Kagura: Shinovi Verses was originaly a vita exclusive but now the pc is getting a port! I was really excited for this since I'm a big fan of the senran kagura series and have played both the japanese verson and the english release of the vita games. When the english release was anounced, people were afraid that it would get censored in some way but I can confirm that it's exactly as the original. The only things that are changed are the girls ages (for obvious reasons). Other than that the game is just the same with no pictures altered and the dialogue being as edgy/lewd as it was intended.\n\nThe PC port is great and would highly suggest this if you don't own a vita. It was obvious at times on the vita when too much was going on or when Hikage would do her 2nd specal the game would chug a bit. Playing it now (and testing out Hikage's 2nd specal) it's as smooth as it can be with no inturuptions! As an added bonus, it seems like they allowed more enemies on screen for you to attack which always feels more satisfying. The only problem I have with the game (and it's a small one) is the intro video. I'm not sure why but it has bad screen tearing and has trouble keeping up with the colors. (it could be a me problem. who knows) but the only thing that matters is the game play and how it runs and feels and it runs great at a steady 60 FPS. The models for every character look great and I kind of look forward to someone ripping them for SFM projects since they are much better than the 3DS models.\n\nAll in all this is a great port and i'll have fun 100% this game for a 4th time! Something you might not know too is they caried over some cheats from the vita verson. If you want to unlock the Homura Crimson Squad early for story mode or use them immediately for online play then at the school select hold  L + R, then use D-pad: Up, Left, Right, Down, Up, Right, Left, Down, Up, Right, Down, Left, Up, Up, Left, Down, Right, Up. I already ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off a few people online with Hikage so heres how to get her super quickly.\n\nENJOY THE GAME!!!","June 2","true","3.2"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","8","9","3","2"

There was some problems I had so I might as well write it down and hopefully it will get patched or updated.\n\nPros:\n- 3D Models are great\n- Jell-O Boobs (maybe cause I'm a perv)\n- Controller support (although the layout is Xbox and I'm a keyboard player)\n- Lots of side missions to keep you playing if you want to level up or 100% complete it.\n- The enemies tend to be annoying but you get past it over the time of leveling up\n- Though it's a hack and slash, it does get difficult and doesn't make it boring (you can also change the difficulty)\n- Lots of sh*t to buy for customization and completing the game fully\n- Story mode tends to help a lot in leveling up\n\n\nCons:\n- Servers tend to lag at points (maybe cause of different locations)\n- Yokazura's gauntlets are loud as hell as well as Yumi's ice trail (yes I have tried to lower the volume, didn't work)\n\n\nSide Con:\nI've been hearing this game keeps crashing, I recommend following the specs needed which is usally at the top of the reviews, if it doesn't work then I don't know.\n\n\nSo in the end, I really enjoyed it and hopefully the cons get patched/updated. If you're an anime lover and have time to spam the sh*t out of your keyboard because of them t*tties, then you should buy it. Though I hope they put "Senran Kagura Estival Versus" on Steam.","June 1","true","23.6"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","82","9","11","4","1"

It's actually pretty fun to play. I don't play a lot of these musou type games, but I can say the gameplay is more fun than Neptunia U. I've played through one school's arc (Hebijo) and did all 5 characters arcs for the girls in that school. It took about 9 hours and never really felt like grind. The story was actually alright and not complete garbage like some people might expect. There are some wierd things on the technical side that could probably use some work. If you play on a 1080p monitor, you probably won't have any issues, but on a 1440p monitor, Fullscreen resolution is maxed at 1080p. If you set the game to borderless window, menu elements will be 1440p, but the game is still rendering at 1080. Someone could probably fix that. I don't mind it much though. It's a pretty good looking game for a Vita port overall I suppose.\n\nEdit: Look up gedosato, this program fixes the resolution issue. I've forced 4k and downsampled it to 1440p, looks much nicer now.\n\nRyobi best girl\n\nOh and I guess the Online works pretty well when I can get into a game. A few times It just said "Failed to Join room" for no apperent reason though, which is kind of annoying. Actual matches were lag free though, and there's a decent amount of players, 5-10 rooms whenever I checked. That's in the first week though.","June 4","true","11.6"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

Shakespeare\n\nSenran Kagura Shinovi Versus is a game that does everything that the critically acclaimed masterpieces Battle Raper 1 and 2 did, but far, far better. In this game, you take control of a large cast of hot babes (except Mirai, but don't bully her), and do Dynasty Warriors. Taking inspiration from another game similar to Dynasty Warriors, Drakengard, the entire cast has been made to be batshit insane, ranging from Minori - a stupid dumb idiot to a weirdo who can't take off her mask all the way to the eyebrow girl from Kill La Kek. Another similarity to Drakengard is that this game is very plot centric, each and every girl has a huge amount of plot (except Mirai, so be nice to her). However, the best part of this game is the dressing room feature where I can touch all the honeys I could even want.\n\nOverall this game has even better lingerie than Estival Versus, so it's gotta be a 10/10 baybeeeee.\nOnly buy this if you are willing to be nice and pay attention to Mirai.","June 2","true","7.3"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","69","11","16","5","0"

It's a great series. Not for the obvious ♥♥♥♥ are life, ♥♥♥ is hometown bits.\n\nIt actually does well as a dynasty warriors-type game. Without the objectives of defending bases and such. You're mostly beating the clothing off other people. The game itself takes place in a timeline between Senran Kagura 1 and Senran Kagura 2, which are games that are on the Nintendo 3DS. So if this is your first Senran Kagura game, that's realy the only detail you're really missing story-wise.\n\nOther than that. It has very miniscule graphical options. Really only adjustments for screen resolution and it's mostly only rendering in 1080p at maximum with 60 FPS. Unless you use GeDoSaTo. However, do keep in mind that it is a Vita port so you're not gonna make the graphics more amazing than cell-shaded anime graphics can be.\n\nI will have to say though, currently as is, it runs amazingly. However, the hitbox logic and hit logic in general is definitely tied to the FPS. The game was designed to be ran at 30 FPS. When they put it at 60 FPS, because the hit logic was tied to the frames, players will actually do 2x more hits than usual. Which leads to characters like Yozakura doing one-hit kills on players in PVP with her weakest special attack.\n\nNetcode is what it is, it's not amazing or great, but it does its job for PVP.\n\nI would say buy it if you're either into anime, ♥♥♥♥ and ♥♥♥, stripping clothes off, or general beat 'em up dynasty warriors-styled games.","June 2","true","22.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

The franchise as a whole has grown in mechanics a whole lot since the first game. the original game on the 3DS can actually get kind of challenging, and i played it to death, and i have 100% on that game. This is the second game of the franchise, and when you consider the hardware differences between the 3DS and the Vita, they definitely had a lot less hardware limitations when they were developing this game. I own it one vita, but never got all of the dlc. The steam version however has all of the DLC and was pleasantly surprised to find them available to purchase in-game in the store. Senran Kagura 2: Deep Crimson on the 3DS doesn't play as well as this one to be honest, but the 3ds games are more of a side-scrolling style beat'em up with weird camera controls. Deep Crimson, although is on the 3ds, has much higher quality character models and environments, and has different models for the weapons, but the tag system in it isn't as much fun as the fast paced aerial-raves in this one. Shinovi Versus plays well, no problems with framerates, fanservice is gratuitous and fantastic, and the story is much less serious than the first one, but that's ok because more ♥♥♥♥.","June 5","true","10.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

The story/cutscenes are told in a style of a visual novel wich can be pretty lengthy sometimes, to me its a fun change of pace to relax between missions but they might not satisfy everyone, especially if you just want to get to the battle but you can skip them if you want.\n\nOn the technical side of things the game is locked at 60fps and has a max resolution of 1080p the game still uses the very low res shadows from the vita version that can sometimes take you out of the experience but on the positive side of things it no longer has the slow playstation save system.\n\nAll in all senran kagura shinovi versus is a surprisingly solid pc port, i was expecting crashes and frame drops but as of yet none of them have appeared. thanks for reading.","June 1","true","4.1"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

The battles and gameplay are similar to Dynasty Warriors. You run around a 3D map fighting a huge amount of faceless enemies until you reach a main (boss) characters. This game have your standard light attack, heavy attack, guard, dash, etc. Where this game differ is how you can activate your ninja transformation. Transforming into your ninja outfit refills your health and make your attacks more devastating. Also another big feature is how outfits will tear away as your lose health until they are left with nothing but there undies on and sometime even less. But don't worry, they got censors (damn it...)\n\nHonestly the gameplay is can get repetitive especially if you don't like beat em up. But where the replay ability and life of this game is the collectible outfits and items. You can buy outfits and change your characters into a huge amount of items and outfits. You can change them from hair style and outfit, down to what type of underwear they wear. It seriously add to the life of this game.\n\nHonestly this is a fun perverted game and it knows it.

It's really basic beat 'em up game, and it's probably safe to say that most of the budget went into things that are not the gameplay, such as voicing, Nan Yaegashi's funky art/designs and opening animation.\nYou know how Neptunia games are essence of no-budget JRPGs? Senran Kagura is the same thing for beat 'em ups. The stages are recycled harder than in Dragon Age 2, they are very short(though this keeps each mission from overstaying its welcome), there are probably less than 10 types generic mooks to beat, if you fail a mission and want to restart it you'll have to sit through two loading screens before pressing Retry, whenever a boss character appears in the middle of the stage game has to stop to load, non-skippable animations and loading screens regularly break the flow of the game, the port is very bare-bones with only options for resolution(up to 1080p) and window options...\n\nBut like I said, I'm enjoying this. Unlike Neptunia, the gameplay does have some proper weight, so whole package isn't carried solely by the silly story and cast. And speaking of cast, oh man. This is easily where the meat of the appeal is. Every character has their own play-style, and you'll have chance to experience all of them. Though this also means that you'll be playing with some which you don't definitely enjoy, but there are more hits than misses thankfully.\nAnd the characters are all wonderfully over-the-top archetypes. Protagonist brimming with positivity? Masochist who loves being abused and called names? Poor girl spending her days growing bean sprouts because they are best food ever? It also helps that most of them are very positive characters, keeping with the overall happy tone of series.\nThe story does make an attempt for seriousness, but it kind of comes of ham-fisted. This is a series that revels in ridiculousness, but serious moments make you appreciate those all the more.\nCustomization of character appearances is usually big deal to people, and it doesn't fail here. You have tons of clothing options, accessories you can place whenever you please, hairstyles can be switched... And whatever you, those changes will stay on. So you can dress one group of characters however you like, switch to others and those clothes will stay on.\n\nEven if you complete everything as fast as possible and don't shoot for high-grades or replays of missions, you'll be definitely getting your money's worth. The missions are short, but there's lots of them. And story segments between them are short enough so that they don't get in way of action... As said before, other things do that.\nSenran Kagura is definitely rough, but if you enjoy beat 'em ups and clunkiness like what was common in PS2 era, this is totally safe bet.\nOh, and if you want an actual challenge, make sure to play in Hard Mode and to ignore solo-stories until you're done with main story for each group.","June 5","true","27.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Lev","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198001113832/","57 products in account","Having never played any of the titles in this series, I came into this rather blind as to what to expect.  The story and characters are quite interesting, but the gameplay is very simplistic.  After I got the hang of the combat, I found many battles insanely easy.  Long story short: this game stands on its personality.  If you like that personality and are ok with a simple arena-type beat'em up, then you will enjoy this game.  Otherwise I would be unable to recommend the title.\n\nTechnically, this is a bare-bones port.  The resolution is somewhat odd in that it seems to only match your desktop resolution, but that may be patched at some point.  For me I play it on at 1080p and I get almost flawless 60 fps.  There are no other visual options beyond resolution and display type (I use borderless windowed).  It is too bad that the developer did not put more into the graphics as you will never forget that you are playing an higher-res version of a VITA title.\n\nThere is native 360 controller support, and I can use a generic PSX-to-USB adapter and x360ce to set-up a fake-360 controller that also works.  Controls are quite responsive, and the only aspect I have trouble with is the parry move.  Due to the previously mentioned easiness of the game I do not get a lot of practice with it either.\n\nLoad times could use some work, although they are not horrible, just noticable.  I would expect them to be faster for what is being loaded.\n\nFor its story and technical soundess, I give this a thumbs up, but just barely.\n\nComputer:\nWindows 7 Professional\nSSD\n16 GB ram\n2 GB GeForce GTX 770\ni7 4770 processor\nPlayed on 42-inch Plasma TV via HDMI cable.","June 5","true","10.1"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Never played any other Senran Kagura game before. So far, I enjoy this. It has pretty easy to pick up and play mechanics, and a decent paced beat 'em up. The camera is sometimes not very friendly and there's no way to change camera sensitivity. There's a couple audio bugs too. If it's not obvious, you should play this with a controller. It's well optimized, and decent looking for an anime-ish game that was ported from a PS Vita release. And of course, this contains -- constant -- fanservice if that's your thing. If not, the outfit break scenes and even the special cutscene transformations and attacks are easily skippable.

The game itself has some nice eye candy aswell as easy to learn controls if you just looking to kill some time before you leave or if you\'re a new comer whom has never played a SK game before. Seeing as the is a Beat\'em up game the gameplay does at times get repeative, and the lack of other single player modes kinda kills the single player aspect after you level up all the Girls, but then you can take the battle to MP where you can battle real players or fight agianst computer players.\n\nOverall this is a game that I really, really, really enjoy enough to for to even buy the game twice, but three times.\n\nA bit on the negative side, the load times are kinda slow, and the framerate in full screen is kinda weird, but when in windowed it is just fine.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TasTill/recommended/411830/","TasTill","IlluminaTima","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TasTill/","277 products in account","I'm gonna break down this review in two sections. One for people who are new to the series and one for those who already played it on Vita.\n\nFor newcomers\n\nThe biggest question for anyone who is not familiar with the series is "Is there anything besides T&A to these games?" and the answer to that is a definitive "Yes!"\n\nSenran Kagura games' two strongest points, at least in my opinion, are combat and characters.\n\nCombat is quite simple and satisfying, combining the battles against hordes of various mobs and against other playable characters. The fighting is fast, colorful, and responsive. Each character has a truly unique playstyle and each player will be able to find their own favorite. There are speedsters, like Ikaruga and Hikage, brawlers, that rely on powerful, chargeable attacks, like Katsuragi and Yozakura, there are fighters that prefer to fight at the distance, like Mirai, and there are some quirky and cheesy fighters that rely on status effects, like Haruka.\n\nCharacters are simply awesome. And I don't mean it in a "good for an ecchi/fanservice", I mean legitimately frigging awesome. Each character is truly unique, with great backstory, likable and varied personality, memorable quirks, and superb interactions with other cast members. They all are truly developed (pun intended) individuals that will make you love them. The addition of individual little story missions for each character also helps as it showcases them in various humorous situations.\n\nHowever, this particular game is not without its flaws. The difficulty curve is a little bit unbalanced. You're free to replay missions to level up your characters, but doing so even for a little bit makes future missions incredibly easy. There's also small variety in missions in general. Each time your mission is just "Kill all mobs, move to the next area, kill all mobs, defeat the boss".\n\nIn short\n+ Simple, colorful, fast paced, and satisfying combat\n+ Great characters\n+ Unique and varied gameplay for each cast member\n+ Buttload of customization options\n- Unbalanced difficulty curve\n- Repetitive missions\nI was also once a newcomer to the series and I was quite prejudiced against it based on its presentation. After giving it a try, however, I was able to see that there's much more to it. While all the titilation is always on the forefront, at some point you either stop paying attention to it or (just like characters in the game) start treating it as a joke. Basically, if you are interested, just give it a chance. You just might want to stay in this hometown.\n\nFor those who already played it on Vita.\n\nSmooth as butter 60 FPS framerate and all DLCs. That's all I needed to pick up this game again. The framerate really does wonders enhancing the gameplay.\n\nSo stop wasting your time and buy it! If we lucky they'll port Estival Versus next!","June 1","true","4.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

At heart, it is a 3d brawler similar to Dynasty Warriors or DMC, with great gameplay across a variety of maps and enemies with lots of selectable characters whom all play differently. The visuals, even for a Vita port, look fantastic and run consistently smooth. The music is probably my favorite part of the series with lots of rock and dance music infused with traditional japanese instruments and orchestral elements. The translation is the MVP, though: XSEED has done a phenomenal job infusing outrageous premises with incredibly self-aware humor. As I so often say, it is its own fanfiction. And even with all the laughs going around, there are still plenty of moments where you might feel your heart swell just a tiny bit.\n\nCompared to the Vita version, this one completely blows it out of the water. Visually and performance-wise, it\'s on par with the PS4 version of Estival Versus. It isn\'t completely bug free, but the worst things you\'ll encounter are some shaky character models and maybe a moment or two where the camera hates you. It is missing the more gimmicky features like the microphone skirt blow or the other way to enter frantic mode, but honestly that really isn\'t anything you\'d notice missing anyway.\n\nThere\'s a ton of content, probably 20-30 hours worth easily with the main storyline and Shinobi Girl\'s Heart missions. I haven\'t had a chance to try the multiplayer yet but it seems stable and adds more replay value to the title.\n\nThe fact that all of the DLC is included for a price that is less than the version on the Vita costs is icing on the cake. The dressing room is extremely in-depth, if that\'s your thing. If you\'re into brawlers or like games with a great sense of humor, or even if you\'re just interested in the eye candy (which there is a good amount of, even if it isn\'t what I think makes the series incredible), you should definitely check out Shinovi Versus!","June 1","true","26.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It\'s not for everyone, but I enjoyed ploughing through enemies and the characters are very funny and have great character development (no seriously it\'s pretty in depth with their backstories and personalities). By itself, with no fanservice, it would still be an above average and solid title - albeit with an ok story. The graphics on PC are pretty good and run flawlessly at 1080p 60fps, and there is full mouse support in and out of the menu - things not always seen in japanese pc ports. It\'s apparent alot of work was put into this. One gripe i have is there seems to be no anti-aliasing. However just set anti-aliasing on in your gpu settings to on for the game and it\'s perfect. All in all a good game that I hope sells a ton on steam.","June 1","true","3.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Very fun hack-n-slash/beat-em-up laced with fan service. The controls are responsive and fluid, and the combat is quick, all great things to have in this kind of game. Many people like to label this as a "Musou/Warriors" sort of game, but the only things it really has in common is the hack-n-slash combat, and semi-large number of enemies, it lacks the objectives and defence points etc. that those sort of games had, something I found to typically be more of an annoyance than something I liked in them. The game does have a very large selection of playable characters (with the DLC characters included in this version), and they all play and feel unique form eachother for the most part. The story here isn't anything special, it's a side-game in the series with what essentially amounts to be a throw-away story (though the main story arc isn't particularly special either), but I feel this isn't a game that anybody would actually play for the story anyway (despite those who claim it's what they're here for). Visually it looks pretty good, nothing amazing, but do remember, this is a port of a Vita game, and it's a game that looked pretty great over there, and manages to hold up pretty well here.

That it is the definitive edition of the game!\n\nIt has all the original had to offer plus all previously released DLC INCLUDED into the base game.\nThe DLC can be bought in the ingame store using ingame money (gained by completing missions)\n\nThe 60FPS really makes the game shine, Although I do have the feeling that it has broken a few things.\nSuch as the air to ground attacks that somehow sometimes give 200+ combo's :')\n\nAll and all a great game and multiplayer is more active then it ever got on Vita so that's a plus to :3","June 3","true","12.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Besides gameplay, you're pretty much going to be swarmed with it. The feminist door is  that-a-way.\n\nOnce again, it's another game that I've seen and enjoyed. Senran Kagura Shinovi Versus is definitely a great game to play, if you have a good enough computer. With my own computer, however, I was able to keep the 60 FPS cap at all times. The graphics aren't customizeable, meaning that you'd have to stay at whatever framerate you have. Or maybe you need to reduce the resolution. I haven't tested it myself.\n\nBesides being a big mountain of fanservice, the game is basically a big "beat em' up", one of my now favorite genres of games. I enjoyed the mechanics of the game - it made it challenging but at the same time relaxing, knowing how to perfect combos and such. Guarding is one thing I haven't used  at all  though, so it's still frustrating to get comboed myself. The game also revolves around the "Shinobi Tenshin", which basically transforms your character into a different suit, with different buffs. (And all the more fanservice, too!)\n\nThe game is also very customizeable - both in accessories, controls, and many, many outfits. In my runthrough of the Hanzo Academy, the shop allows you to buy clothing and lingerie from the shop, along with many songs, pictures, and a few other characters. There's also something called the "Lingerie Lotto", where you donate a certain amount of money to reach a quality of pantsu. (I've gotten one "Climactic!" before, and I wasn't NOT amused.)\n\nTL;DR:\nThe game revolves around oversexualized women. (or lolis, if you're into that)\nRunning it will take a "more than decent" computer, but it should still be fun.\nThe game's a breathtaking beat em' up that keeps you at bay.\nALL OF THE FANSERVICE.\nOverall, I enjoy the quality of this game. Besides the very obvious sexualization, it's still a fun game to play just for fun. There is a possible multiplayer mode, but I haven't tested that out myself yet. More will come later. Maybe if I care. It's definitely worth the money ($26.99 on sale) if you can run it, and it'd be best if you can get it ASAP.\n\nWho's your favorite girl from the Senran Kagura series?

Most of us with decent PC's are able to downsample from 4K and higher, with high quality AA. That said, the game lacks any sort of configurable graphics. You are only able to modify your resolution and screen type (borderless windowed/fullscreen etc).\n\nThe texture-work is as expected from a Vita port very bad, however the are already folks working on texture modding so expect to see high resolution mods in the future. The character models aren't super bad looking but they could use more polygons. Map textures and props are PS2 tier and not very good looking. However your eyes will be busy on the characters so eh?\n\nThe gameplay itself is fast-paced with tight controls. Akin to that of games such as the Ultimate Ninja Storm games. However some might begin to question the difficulty of the singleplayer experience as they play further, I've been told the last chapters on hard-mode are decently challenging. And before writing this I had quite a fun fight against Rin which lasted for around five minutes, unlike some other fights where they end faster than the loading screens.\n\nThe glaring fan-service might turn people off (ayy) but if one can see past it, there's a solid beat em' up game thats quite fun to play. If you want more SK games, I've heard the Estival Versus game on PS4 is an all around better game, can't say for sure though since I haven't played it.\n\nAll previous DLC content has been incorporated into the PC version, so there is a ton of outfits for you to dress your wife with.\n\nHaven't done any multiplayer so I can't tell much about it.","June 2","true","13.0"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","44","4","9","2","0"

You take enough damage you clothes get torn a little bit each time until there's virtually nothing left except your bra and knickers. This sounds comical (which it is tbh) but the more of your clothes you lose the more your defense keeps getting lowered so be careful.\n\nBasically if you're looking for a game that's easy to get into I would recommend this.

It is simple and simplicity really is the strong suit of this series. Turn the game one, enjoy the game and have a good time.\n\nThe game isn't for everyone. If you loathe anime and anime fanservice I advise you to not bother with this series.\nIt is not a crime to hate Games like Senran Kagura and it is also doesn't make you a bad person if you like the series, the characters, the simple gameplay and the fanservice.\n\nI played trough all SK Games, Burst and Deep Crimson on 3ds aswell as Shinovi and Estival Versus on Vita and PS4. I had a really good time with all the games. It does get repetitive if you just play Story Missions. If you are like me, play the game in short bursts for a one or two hours at a time and you will have a really good time.\n\nI bouht Shinovi Versus for PC because I love the Series, I love Marvelous and XSeed and I want to support their efforts.","June 2","true","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Well, before taking the plunge and buying this game, I was really concerned this would be mindless button masher that depended on the gimmick of stripping and bounce physics to be entertaining. Now mind you, the gimmick turns out to be a welcome addition, considering that this game overall is actually fun.\n\nThere actually is story to this game, and to me it seemed on par with any fair, generic anime you see around.  Is the story weak in small areas? Yeah, but most animes are, so I find it forgivable.\n\nPro's\n-Over 20 characters (counting the included DLC), each unique with a quirky personality type and combat moveset.\n-An unexpectedly long story, played out from different points of view of 4 ninja schools, each with 5 characters.\n-A ridiculous amount of buyables/unlockables, allowing for some pretty great customization, up to 4 accessory slots per character.\n-Looking at total missions completed, I'm about 15 hours into the game so far, have been focusing on playing Story Missions, and I'm not even halfway done. So, you absolutely will get your money's worth in terms of gameplay time.\n-The clothing damage and jiggles certainly could not be anything but a Pro.\n\nCon's\n-The graphics aren't nearly as nice as Estival, a sequel to this game. It's a port of a PS Vita game, so I guess there's no surprise the graphical quality isn't as impressive as I'd like them to be.\n-Some of the story is played out of points of view of characters that tend to prattle on when they narrate. There's going to be a fair amount of narration that you'll probably be skipping and skimming.\n","June 6","true","16.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
