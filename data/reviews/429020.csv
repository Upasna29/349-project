At the time of writing this review the game is still in very early developement.\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXgo4c0OAMw\n\n\n\nFirst of all, the game is in very early developement as of now.\nWhen you first start the game you have the option to start the game immediately in singleplayer, multiplayer or with the tutorial. When you first start up the tutorial 4 mechanics are introduced to you:\n\nMining The mining mechanic is pretty simple, you get out your mining tool and shoot the ores, the ores then go right into the inventory.\n\nVehicles In the tutorial area there are 2 vehicles a hoverbike and a plane. The hoverbike doesn't really fly, but the plane does and it shoots too. The controls of the plane are a simple. If you hit the ground or bump into something with the plane it doesn't get damaged. Also if you jump out of the plane you don't take any falling damage.\n\nWeapons\nThe weapons in this game are still very simple left to shoot right for iron sights, they don't have to reload and you have infinite ammo.\n\nEnemies\nThere are two kinds of enemies in this game, spiders or soldiers. The AI right now isn't very smart, they just kind of stand there at the moment. The shots don't always register either.\n\n\n\n\nThe open world is pretty colorful, there are buildings and spaceships, plus there are fires and gass clouds that will kill you if you stand too close. You can also find merchants and loot in the open world.\n\n\n\nAs I said before the game is still early in developement, but it could become something if done right.\n\n\nTips for the dev:\n(strike)When you get in the water it's very hard to find a way out, because many of the slopes are too steep to walk on.(/strike) (improved as of 2/13/2016\nThe models are very basic, this could use some improvement.\nThere is not much variation in enemies or loot.\nSome story elements would be cool.\nMusic!\nThe tutorial area is way too bright.\nThe menu text is sometimes hard to read.","February 12","true","1.2"," 32 of 49 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","32","49","0","1"

I understand that the game just came out today. However, in it's current state, there is really no incentive to play the game. It is a very pretty game and it is definatley unique, but as someone who is very familiar with these types of games, this is one to stay away from right now. It amazes me that one person made it and for that I give them so much praise, however, as a gamer, I say wait til more is inputed into the game and it becomes more of what we would expect from a game like this. I sincerely hope that this game goes places, it has SO much potential and I can't wait to see it grow. I will continue to play it while hoping that I can watch it grow. Purchase it if you wish, but knowing how most gamers are, I can say that alot will not enjoy it in it's current state. I hope to update this review in the near future.","February 12","false","3.2"," 29 of 54 people (54%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","54","29","54","2","5"

I'm usually not one to play single-player games but this is fun. Sneaking around the AI and evading or countering their surprise attacks is a thrill.\n\nDifferent mining fields provide different ore - some are more valuable than others; but you need to make sure to stay safe when traveling between fields!\n\nVery interesting art style that looks even more unique when you get high. For an added bonus, get high then go mine ore to watch the glowing blocks whizz across your screen. ;)\n\nThe world is indeed very vast. Easy to get lost, but that just adds to the challenge. You can come up with a sort of directional system by taking into account the overhead aircraft and the large skyscraper city. This will help you find other points of interest such as the mining fields, merchants, and aircraft pads.\n\nI expect even more excitement once some multiplayer servers start popping up. I will be making my tyrannical kingdom server later on. ;)\n\nSome suggestions to dev:\nA "safety deposit box" or bank system to store items (or currency). Perhaps have the merchant charge a fee to maintain the box. To help avoid losing items every time you die, because it is easy to die when starting out. :P\nMore creatures! The AI military are cool but PvE creature fighting is fun too. Maybe have them near the mine fields? So that if one wishes to mine, they must also take into account the risk of being attacked by a creature.\nMaybe a map? :P\nEdit: I uploaded my gameplay as well. It's just over an hour of seamless gameplay of me trying to figure things out, mine, explore, etc. so it's not an edited review of the game or anything like that. There will be some long periods where I realize you can walk across the water to the next island for example, but you also get to see me jump out of my chair every time I start getting shot by enemies heh.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVVwBQfqvkk","February 12","true","7.3"," 15 of 27 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","15","27","0","4"

You can move around and interact with the world but it's not really a game yet (but it's early access so that's to be expected).\n\nWhat I'd like to see improved are things like:\n- a world map\n- a mini map/radar showing enemies/ore/ships\n- automatic pick-up of ore or an ore magnet\n- explanation of modules you can buy/find in the game\n- please replace 'acquire' with 'pick up'\n- water and poisenous fog sometimes rendered through trees and bushes\n- obvious pop in of detailed\n- health bars for enemies\n- actualy seing enemies react when they get shot\n- button to turn headlight on/off\n- scrolling through weapons/gear with scroll wheel\n- gamepad support\n- more interaction with the environment like trees reacting when you shoot them, being able to enter and use tanks, being able to climb ladders etc.\n- you can walk on the water?! either kill the avatar and have him respawn or make the avatar swim through the water\n- make it clear to which group I belong\n- more diverse animal life\n\nI like the way the game looks but it feels more like a tech demo right now then a functional game. I got this in an Indiegala bundle so I didn't pay a lot. I would not have bought it otherwise in it's current state. I will get back to this in a couple of months to see what has been improved.","March 5","true","1.3"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

With no real feedback to the weapons, being hit or hitting people. Giving no fun during fights.\nGame loop is boring, revolves around "mining" but no need to explore for resources as they are just next to big shiny towers.\nNo real chance to "build your own game" within the online mode, No interactions and just combat no chance of just having a laugh.\nGame looks pretty in parts, but falls down in others.\nA.I. doesn't exist, even simple path finding doesn't seem to be there.\nVariety of weapons are slim\n...... See video if you need to know more.\nRecommendation, No\nChance of revisit - None, no idea where they are going with the game to make it stand up or what "fun" factors the game may contain\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkGPEFghFCw\n\n-- Original --\nGames looks really good but not much that can be said after that. But disappointment followed by game breaking bug. If you like optimism followed by disappointment give a watch. Happy to revisit purely for the overall look, but for now give a miss.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/a_xXX3qUVkk","February 12","false","2.7"," 22 of 59 people (37%) found this review helpful","37","22","59","0","12"
