First, I'll start with a review of the Enhanced Edition.\n\nThis is a beautiful enhancement to an awesome game. It contains all of the expansions and content from Icewind Dale, plus more. I know that many critics and users will complain, as always, that it doesn't add enough content to warrant the $20 price tag. I disagree. $20 is not expensive for a game and IWD adds even more than BG1 and BG2 enhanced editions did. It's very similar to the latter two games but since Icewind Dale originally didn't have very many class choices, you're given all of the kits from BG2 plus a few new ones. The new quests and content add about ~6 hours of play (there are $20 games out there that take this amount of time to beat) and much of it is drawn from deleted content that never launched with the original game, which is awesome to see if you're a fan of the original.\n\nThe UI is beautiful. I have experienced no bugs at all and everything is running flawlessly. The release of the game came quickly and as a surprise. I was a little worried that this meant there could be serious issues but so far I haven't seen evidence of that.\n\n****************************************************************************************************\n\nIWD AS A GAME, WHAT TO EXPECT: Icewind Dale is a Dungeons and Dragons-based, isometric RPG that uses the Infinity Engine with a combat system similar to Dragon Age: Origins. It is like Baldur's Gate but at the same time, very different. Icewind Dale is not dialogue heavy. In fact, there's very little dialogue, although the small amount that exists is well-written. The plot IS good but it is rather straightforward and basic, with a couple of twists towards the end. The game has no city exploration or party banter. What it does have is the following: superb music, incredible atmosphere, top-notch level/dungeon design, beautiful artwork, extremely high replay value, a sense of adventure and wonder, and strategic, fun, challenging combat.\n\nThe beauty of the game comes from the music, art and design. The fun of the game comes from two things: (1) combat - including well-designed fights that require placement, strategy and planning and can be very rewarding on higher difficulties; (2) party creation - if you HATE creating full parties and spending hours thinking about how your party will work, this is probably not the game for you. If you don't hate that, it's a lot of fun and adds a ton of replay value. If you're one of those people who hates being given "premade" characters that you can't customize or build from scratch, THIS is the game for you.\n\nYou get 6 party member slots. You can decide how to play the game in whatever way you want. Solo with a sorcerer? Play with 6 archers? Duo with a 'decoy'/'tank' and healer? Make an all-evil party? An all-good party? A mixed party? Sure, you don't get the party banter of Baldur's Gate, but there's a lot of freedom. You can name all of your characters and make them from scratch, gear them up, give them different stats so that they work well together, etc. I have spent hours devising ways to create an effective party, e.g., 2 melee, 2 casters, 2 decoy/tanks, or a mix of classes (multiclassing/dual classing is one of the best parts of D&D), or 6 of the same class, if you want. If this appeals to you, it can be extremely fun.","October 30, 2014","true","85.0"," 442 of 450 people (98%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","98","442","450","3","17"

Beamdog's update of Black Isle's 2000 classic Dungeons and Dragons high fantasy adventure is still as deep and tricky as it ever was. This version is a patched up and polished joint package of Icewind Dale and both of its expansions, Heart of Winter and Trials of the Luremaster. If that means something to you, odds are you've already decided whether or not to buy it. If it doesn't (or if it does but you're still unsure), then read on.\n\nIcewind Dale is based on 2nd edition Dungeons and Dragons, and if you've played any of the other infinity engine games, you know exactly what to expect mechanics wise. This time, however, you'll be building your own party from scratch. While veterans have a good idea of where to go, you absolutely can gimp your party during character creation and wind up headbutting your way through a playthrough that is more difficulty than it needed to be, so if you're a complete novice I'd recommend you look for a guide on the internet. A little hand holding might have been nice here, and it feels like a missed opportunity by beamdog, but its still no great object.\n\nThe main game, Icewind Dale (as opposed to its two expansions) is more fast paced than your average swords and sorcery campaign, and you'll do relatively little carousing with the villagers or solving problems with tools other than axes and fireballs. Battles feel very large, and you'll often breathe a sigh of relief when one floor of a dungeon turns out to contain friendly faces (something the game does fairly often owing to its long dungeon crawls). The game also basically throws you to the wolves, and early on you might find yourself doing a little bit of rope-a-dope by luring one or two enemies at a time - that's bad enough, but it feels as if the developers intended it, which is worse. There are relatively few sidequests to boot, and Kuldahar, the town that serves as a hub of sorts, feels a little too small at times. Still, the story whisks along and actually manages to get pretty interesting at times, and although your characters will be more or less mute for the duration of the game, the voice acting from the game's NPCs ranges from good to excellent.\n\nOverall, the game runs pretty nicely. It's a testament to both how good the original game looked and how nicely Beamdog has cleaned it up that it is still pretty aesthetically pleasing today, and it ran natively on my laptop's bizarro universe 1366x768 monitor. I never experienced a crash to desktop and experienced only one bug that required a reload (to an autosave taken about 60 seconds prior to the bug) during my entire 32 hour playthrough. By the standards of high concept fantasy games, this just about represents a mirror sheen. My one complaint is that fire effects (which are literally low resolution sprites) would often cause the framerate to inexplicably collapse, and more than any other Infinity Engine game, the beautiful painted backgrounds in Icewind Dale often do a lousy job of differentiating between places your characters can go and territory that is unpathable like deep chasms or walls.\n\nThe expansion, Heart of Winter, was criticized at launch for feeling too short (leading to the subsequent release of the downloadable Trials of the Luremaster, which is included here), but after reflecting on my playthrough I disagree pretty strongly here. Instead, the expansion has two entirely different problems that made it feel too long!\n\nThe first of these two issues is that by the time you wrap up Icewind Dale you're dealing with a seriously powerful party of adventures using some major endgame equipment. Save for a few items that actually get upgraded by doing certain (insubstantial) questlines, by the end of both expansions I'd replaced almost none of the equipment that my party was using at the end of Icewind Dale. While the game isn't meant to be a loot treadmill, it's a real bummer everytime you identify a new shield only to think "ah, well I'll be selling this." The only area where I felt any improvement was in my spellcasters, and by that time managing so many spells becomes so difficult that its effectively impossible, so I just relied on my big high level bangers every fight.\n\nAdditionally, while the battles in Icewind Dale sometimes felt a little exhausting, by the time you're through Heart of Winter and Trials of the Luremaster, you might well be bored of fighting, and since that's basically 100% of what you'll be doing, that will put a damper on your enjoyment. On Core difficulty (the default difficulty, which can really be quite tricky) all battles devolved into the same slog of sending my fighters to hack away at enemies while I used my casters to cast as many area of effect spells as possible.  The contrast here between the expansions and the base game could not be stronger, as in Icewind Dale you constantly have access to new and interesting options as your characters get more powerful. You probably wont spend more than a cumulative 12 hours on the two expansions, but they feel like a really long 12 hours, and not always in a good way.\n\nFans of Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition and Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition should take note that there is no extra game content whatsoever, nor any mini-expansions equivalent to the Trials of the Black Pits, so once you've finished Heart of Winter, you're done. Still, even though the base game is much better than its expansions, and it feels like Beamdog went a little light on the feature inclusion, I thoroughly enjoyed my time with Icewind Dale: Enchanced Edition, even if it ran a little longer than it maybe should have. The game is a ton of value for money to boot (at a paltry $20USD), so if you're feeling like a rollicking good time in the wind blasted north of Faerun, then you owe it to yourself to give IWD a go.","November 26, 2014","true","32.1"," 317 of 323 people (98%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","98","317","323","2","2"

Some fans demanded a deeper more robust story, for this they made the classic gem Planescape: Torment, and yet others clamoured for a more intense combat and gameplay experience. Icewind Dale is the result of that.\n\nWhile the story is by no means poor in this game, it is a tad shallow as that is not the point. Icewind Dale is meant for those who wish to have total control over a party. In this game you create a party of six characters choosing their race, class, skills, and gear and take them on an epic adventure with a very deep and enjoyable combat system.\n\nThe original game included 6 races, 8 main classes, 8 specialist mages, and 8 multiclasses, with the option for several classes to dual class. in the ENHANCED EDITION the class kits from Baldur's Gate 2 have been added as well as all new kits and a new race (Half-Orc). These new kits add another 3 class options for the 8 base classes, plus you now have the Sorceror and Barbarian class to play as. This makes Icewind Dale Enhanced Edition probably the game with the MOST amount of class options of any RPG ever!\n\nThe appeal of this game is in making your own party and taking them through the adventures, while you won't experience much in the way of alternate story paths to take, this game offers huge amounts of replayability in terms of party setup. You can go full on with 6 very well built and complimentary characters or try self-imposed challenges like solo runs with a thief, or a party of all mages, there's even an official forum dedicated to challenge runs!\n\nFinally in addition to the entire base game and both expansions, previously unreleased content has been added to the game. Add in that with the updated UI that supports modern platforms and this is the definitive Icewind Dale experience.\n\nYou simply won't find a better game to drop $20 on, so don't hesitate! I also highly reccomend checking out Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition and Baldur's Gate II Enhanced Edition if you enjoy the infinity engine style!\n\nDid I mention it has 6 player crossplatform multiplayer?","October 30, 2014","true","17.1"," 173 of 181 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","173","181","0","4"

I feel like Beamdog learned from some of its earlier mis-steps in the release of Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition, because Icewind Dale: Enhanced Edition is a finely polished presentation.\n\nHere's what you can expect from Beamdog's remake:\n\n+ The original Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition kits, plus two new kits (Priest of Tyr, Priest of Tempus) means far more variety in your party building. Building your party is a meta-game in and of itself, with hundreds of different permutations and combinations of classes that lead to a different experience every time.\n\n+ A clean, lightweight game that runs exceptionally well on most resolutions.\n\n+ Heart of Fury/Insane difficulty modes for veteran players, as well as Story Mode for beginners who just want to experience the game, or learn the ropes. For Civ fans, Story Mode is essentially the Settler difficulty of IWD--a simple, low-challenge difficulty level that helps new players understand the D&D rules.\n\n+ The introduction of Sneak Attack/Crippling Strike for thieves. Thieves (and also Stalker rangers) now have the option of dealing Sneak Attack damage rather than backstab, which vastly improves a thief's viability in combat and adds an interesting tactical dimension to the class. If you were underwhelmed by Thieves in the original IWD, try using the Sneak Attack feature.\n\n+A bunch of additional content, including updated quests and a few dozen brand new items. The itemization in the original IWD was always a little problematic, but Beamdog's remake brings in plenty of powerful new gear.\n\n+ Improved multiplayer. IWD is, in my opinion, a game far better suited to multiplayer than Baldur's Gate. Because IWD has no central protagonist, and is built on team dynamics, the game naturally encourages co-op multiplayer.\n\nConclusion\n\nPick this up if:\n\nYou're a D&D fan and haven't yet tried the Icewind Dale series, probably because it's fifteen years old.\nYou enjoy old school computer RPGs, and want to try something that feels reminiscent of old tabletop games.\nYou loved Baldur's Gate, Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition or any of the earlier Infinity Engine games.\nYou enjoy Bioware/Obsidian RPGs, and want to check out some of their earliest work, when they were still Black Isle.\nThe game is on sale, and you're kind of curious, and you think you might enjoy a fun RPG.","November 2, 2014","true","56.1"," 122 of 127 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","122","127","0","3"

The expansion Heart of Winter and the free mini-expansion Trials of the Luremaster are included.\nUnlike Baldur's Gate Enhanced edition there are no added new areas to the game. However spells from Baldur's Gate 1 and 2 have been imported into Icewind Dale, but since enemy casters feature a much less prominent role in this game, it doesn't make a huge impact. However, you could exploit the additions if you really wanted to.\n\nI don't care all that much for the combat offered by Icewind Dale compared to Baldur's Gate. It contains way too many swarming melee enemies for it to be tactically interesting for my tastes. But I like it all the same (just can't get enough of the infinity engine games!)\n\nIf you like the originals you probably don't need a recommendation. It's the same game.\nIt's a different thing to recommend it to the newcomer. If you haven't played Baldur's Gate before this, play that instead. If you don't like Baldur's Gate, then you proably won't like this game either, but if you like Baldur's Gate and are desperate for more - then Icewind Dale is a good place to go.","December 27, 2014","true","43.7"," 114 of 120 people (95%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","95","114","120","4","2"

Still its a treat to get to play  it again. Am yet to get BGEE or BG2EE. But IWDEE is beautiful, the resolution fix and visual updates are very appreciable. Didnt really face many bugs, none to be honest. So Beamdog's done a competent job I'd say. Also if you're new to the old school DnD rulesets, dont come to this game thinking its a click+hack/slash game. Its not. Every step you take might end in your solo character's/party's untimely demise. For eg., first playthrough my party got decimated right in the begining by seven trolls; so there you are- this game will punish you especially in HoF mode if you take it casually.

As the Enhanced Edition sits currently, I do not recommend it.  To clarify: Enhanced Edition is not the original and there are changes.  Some of the additions are fun (I'm not going to reiterate them here), but there are downsides that will catch your attention if you've played the original.\n\nThe enhanced editions are built from the Baldur's Gate 2 engine using CRE V1.0 and CHR V2.0.  What many do not realize is that because of this some content from the original Icewind Dale has been removed to bring it into line with the Baldur's Gate 2 engine.  I stumbled across this fact in my playing of Enhanced Edition.  I couldn't quite seem to figure out why the gameplay seemed more monotonous than in the original.  And then I discovered that the number of sounds your characters make had been greatly reduced (from 40 to 22).  What this means is that the variety of remarks and sounds your characters make as you command them to move, they take damage, you tell them to attack an enemy, etc. is reduced by almost half.\n\nI'm not sure if there are other aspects of the game that had to be similarly altered in creating Icewind Dale Enhanced Edition.  And for some this may be inconsequential or outweighed by some of the neat additions.  But for me, losing original content is significant.  I'll be playing one of my copies of the original with a mod to make it full screen (find mods easily doing any internet search if you're interested).  Icewind Dale is fantastic.  Just know that if you go the Enhanced Edition route you are going to be missing out on at least a couple authentic elements.  Personally I feel these losses should've been listed with the additions in Enhanced Edition's description so one could properly compare it with the original, but I guess that wouldn't help Beamdog's sales.  I can't help but wonder what else may be missing...\n\nPS  During my playing of Enhanced Edition I had a number of crashes occur (playing the Steam version in Windows).  One would normally report these at the Beamdog forums in the hopes of a fix, but apparently Steam does something that renders crash reporting useless to the developers at Beamdog (as one of them informed me).  Crashes suck.\n\nEdit 2/25/2016:  As of this edit 128 people found this review helpful.  I didn't think it'd get that much visibility.  With enough urging we could actually make a difference.  It is possible, should they determine it worth the effort, for the developers at Beamdog to create new file structures and restore these missing sounds in a future patch.  If you would like to see this happen, visit the feature request section on their forums and let your voice be heard.  The more of us that indicate a desire for such action, the more likely it is to happen.

Obviously this game is hard and shows you how much games have changed. Even modern games which try to capture the spirit of the old RPG games (for example, the excellent 'Legend Of Grimrock') don't come close in difficulty level compared to Icewind Dale.\nIf you're looking for an easy game, you're not going to find it here.

I eventually started playing a little bit on my own, but due to being too young and having a short attention span, all I would do is create characters and kill some orcs and goblins. My computer now has always been incompatible with the orginal copy I have, so I hadn't played this for years. Anywyas, I never got to sink my teeth into this game years ago, but I remembered it as great. It is. Defintiely recommend it to any RPG fan, Dungeons and Dragons fan, or any fan of fairly tactical games. There are changes to it since I last played it, such as the rules being updated to 3rd edition D&D rules and some quests and items I don't remember from previous experiences. Overall, this is one of my favorite games of all time, allowing you to make a party of up to six characters and experiment with a wide variety of races and classes, and even subclasses and different builds for each class. When I installed this onto my computer last week I probably spent about five hours just making a party and experimenting with classes.\n\nAfter you make your party, you start in the fishing village of Easthaven where you do little quests around town and kind of get the hang of the game. There are no real tutorials, mind you, so you'll have to experiment and learn on your own. The combat system is one of the best parts of the game. It allows you to pause, strategize, and make your plan, then unpause and watch the chaos unfold. I highly recommend this game.","April 14, 2015","true","323.6"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","19","20","0","0"

You and your party set out to help people in need, ridding various towns of a plague of monsters they cannot fend off on their own. You will also be travelling dangerous terrains while facing strategic enemies and since you must travel on foot the road is a treacherous journey.\n\nIf you have played Baldur's Gate 1 and 2, you can import your characters from those games and it won't feel unnatural. This will also give you an advantage to your game. Like the Baldur's Gate games, Icewind Dale is based off the Dungeons and Dragons 2nd Edition Ruleset so the similarities are very close.\n\nThe combat is what you'd come to expect from games like Baldur's Gate and Baldur's Gate 2. The difficulty can get extreme but thankfully you can pause the combat and strategically control your party to change the scenario in your favor.\n\nPros  HD and Widescreen resolution support\nKeeps original gameplay intact\nIncludes both expansion packs\nCons  May not work well on older hardware\nPurists may prefer the original with their own mods\nController support would have been nice\nFinal Thoughts:\nOverall this game is not as big as any of the other Infinity Engine games, in fact it's the smallest of all Infinity Engine games but still, this game is worth a playthrough from any true D&D fan. You will get plenty of satisfaction in both the engaging plot written by the incredible storytellers at Obsidian as well as the unrelenting combat.\n\n\nRating (7.8 out of 10)\n\nThis review was written for and is published on the  Lit Reviews [LR] curator page.","January 12","true","20.8"," 25 of 31 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","25","31","2","2"

I am particularly excited about this for several reasons, not the least of which is that this game is my favorite D&D game. I am also excited about it because unlike the Baldur's Gate treatments, this one actually makes a great deal of sense. It is nothing short of a pain in the neck to mod Icewind Dale. I have always had trouble trying to get it to run perfectly. Something always seems to go wrong. I remember losing a corrupt save sometime ago after putting some 40 hours into gameplay. Here, the work is done for you, by people who know what they are doing. Everything runs smooth and the game has never looked better. Is it worth it? It depends on two factors in my mind. 1). How much you like this game. 2). How much you are willing to pay for convenience. To me, I had no problems throwing down 20 bucks on this game, the security of the build is worth it. Still many others will insist on telling you to buy from another distributer for 10 dollars cheaper but with significant hinderances in build quality. The choice is ultimately, as it always is, up to you. Either way, if you haven't played this game, do it.

It is essentially a party based dungeon crawler. Although it lacks the party interactions of Baldur's Gate - as you build the party yourself - it is my opinion that the dungeons are better designed than baldur's gate and the party setup you chose will have much larger impact on the way you play the game.\n\nAside from the visual upgrade as well as the compatibility fixes common to the previous enhanced edition games, Icewind Dale EE adds new spells, items, classes, kits as well as certain mechanics which were introduced in later DnD rules. It has also restored content that was cut from the original game.\n\nIf you've either enjoyed the original Icewind dale in the past, or you just enjoy fantastic dungeon crawlers in general, I would definitely recommend this game for you.

Would do the same given the chance to travel back in time.\nMany say the Icewind Dale series (both I and II)  focus more on action and that their story is inexistant or poor compared to Baldurs Gate.\nI would like to disagree. While both IWD games are more combat focused, the story of Icewind Dale might not seem as epic and long as the one in BG, however its storytelling is much much better: the voice of the narrator, how the tale unfolds at the end, the amazing score by Jeremy Soule puts you in the cold winter mood.\nI find it to be very interesting (wont spoil much but for those familiar with the Forgotten Realms books, the story in IWD serves as base to the events in the IWD trilogy novels with Drizzt and company -which are not that great anyway-)\nThere are actually many moral choices to do via conversations, the difference being here you dont get so harshly punished with -rep points if you decide to be a neutral evil guy via conversations.\nThe combat encounters are obviously one of the best aspects, and it reaches its top notch in IWD2. Again I liked the battles here much more than in BG.\nIf you played this game in the late 90s and liked them, or if you like this type of isometrical rpgs. this is a very good choice.\nI would say this game is better than BG 1, not as good as BG 2, and worst than Icewind Dale 2 (best of them all), but I recomend you all four (with Planescape: Torment on top with  a cherry).","May 8, 2015","true","37.2"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","15","17","0","0"

Mostly on X-com, D1 and D2, Warcraft titles and pretty much any other computer game out there. But I'll tell you. The most fun(Single player) I probably had was on these D&D inspired games such as BG, BG II and Icewind Dale.\nThat being said. Beamdog has revamped these old classics, brought them to Steam, and pulled off an incredible job.\nI love this remastered game. New spells, interface, characters etc. On top of that you can ACTUALLY play with friends online instead of packing 4+ sweaty dudes into a room and having at it.\nIt really feels to me that Beamdog should've made this to begin with instead of WotC. Not hating, but seriously. One of the best games I've played, EVER.\nThank you for making me feel old guys and keep up the great work.","March 4, 2015","true","21.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

While this limits conversations and events between party members, you certainly have control of who you deem worthy in your party. Perhaps you decide to play through as a clan of barbarians or a circle of magi?\n\nIf you are not sure whether or not to spend the whole $19.99, you can always wait for a sale to occur and pick the game up for $10.

Much more on the action side of things than the Baldur's Gate series, but the plot is still strong.  There is no inter-party friction, as you create all the characters yourself, which I appreciated (due to being able to set characters' abilities, skills and whatnot so that they are more efficient), but others who want to hear bickering or have love stories will be disappointed.  The game runs very smoothly, I have not encountered any errors or crashes after 8 hours of playing, which is a nice improvement over my attempts to patch over my original copy of Icewind Dale (rather mixed results there).  Combat is still extremely strong, with a focus on tactical placement of your party (doorways and other choke points are often key) and making the most out of a combined arms strategy; sending out six wizards or six fighters will likely end in death and frustration.\nThe enhancements to the Infinity Engine are good, but if you want something that looks like The Order, you will be sorely disappointed.  Sprites are reused (the goblin butler being the same as the goblin raiders), and it does look like a 90s RPG.  For most of the fans this won't be a deal breaker, but if you look at the screen shots and don't like what you see, then you should know that those pictures are representative of what you will see in the game.\nIf you want an RPG with most of the sensitivities of the Baldur's Gate series, but wished there was more combat and less Imoen, this is the droid you are looking for.","April 2","true","9.9"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

He got a nifty throwing axe in Chapter 4 that worked like a boomerang. Making him decent at ranged combat.\n\nA Palladin - Secondary tank, had a few off heals, could cure disease but was mainly a melee fighter, almost as good as the fighter with a few utility moves to compensate. Got a helmet in Chapter 5 that enabled him to cure paralysis once per day, god damn was that useful.\n\nA Cleric - Also used as an off tank, heavy armor, clubbed things with a morningstar, and had such an array of healing and support spells, some later spells enabled him to temporarilly fight with the effectiveness as a fighter.\n\nA Theif - used for scouting, trap detection and disarming, basic ranged attacks, but could also duel wield and do mega damage if attacking an enemy from behind. He got a lot of gear that increased his ability to hide in shadows, so by chapter 5 he was in a permanent form of semi stealth, which made it so enemies rarely noticed him and made his attacks all the more powerful.\n\nA Ranger - Crapped out the most damage with the longbow, and later a crossbow. She could also do great melee damage later on when I found a powerful halbred for her. Both her and the theif could not take much damage though.\n\nA Druid - Had a large array of offensive and healing spells, one of the most useful characters. Got a ring in Chapter 6 that enabled her to cast extra level 1 and 2 spells.\n\nThat is what I love about the classes in this game, they are so versatile that you can fight in so many ways. There is so much strategy to the game its unreal, and the gear you get just feels so empowering for your party. Even then the game is hard as nails, and I wouldn't have it any other way.\n\nThere are a few annoying things about the game though, most of the bosses are immune to ranged weapons, forcing my Ranger and theif to go melee, no matter what the hit rating was of my ranged weapons, the arrows just had no effect. Even if I used the special arrows that you can only get my killing certain enemies in the game, which you have to get identified before you can even use them; those are still not good enough to harm the bosses. And the last boss is immune to magic, so many boss fights just come down to either tank n spank, or kite and spank as most of the bosses will rip even my fighter a new ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ if you go toe to toe with them.\n\nBare in mind, the game does not explain a lot of what the stats do, so let me just warn you:\n\nIf you want anyone to do melee combat, they need dexterity to incrase their armor, or else they will be too easy to hit.\n\nMany ranged weapons have a strengthing requirement, make sure your ranger has atleast 15 strength.\n\nIn anycase, the game is freaken great, and it will take a long time to beat if you've never played it before, I played the original until my computer broke when I was on chapter six, which took maybe 70-90 hours to get there, but I beat in now in 28 hours or so because I knew so much about the game.\n\nReplayability is moderate, there are a million ways to play, but its basically the same game over and over.","September 12, 2015","true","76.7"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thewizardkiller/recommended/321800/","thewizardkiller","The Chosen One","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thewizardkiller/","115 products in account","Icewind Dale: Enhanced Edition... is an Enhanced Edition of Icewind Dale 1. Seriously, though, it’s a great game, and I’ll tell you why.\n\nStory and setting: The game’s setting is incredibly simple: Icewind Dale. It sits behind the Spine of the World, a mountain range that seperates Icewind Dale from the Sword Coast. As such, almost every single area in the game you explore will be covered with snow, although there are some exceptions, such as caves and dungeons deep underground. The areas are fairly small, smaller than in Western RPGs and maybe a little smaller than even most Japanese RPGs, but there large enough to reward the curious player that takes the time to explore every little nook and cranny. The story, while simple and clichéd, is pretty good considering that you have to create your own characters through character creation. Basically, you’re part of an expedition from Easthaven off to explore whatever troubles are plaguing Kuldahar, only bad things happen during the trip to Kuldahar and your party members are the only survivors of an avalanche. I really can’t say anymore without spoiling the story and, while it does have its clichés, it’s still better than the story in most RPGs, even by today’s standards, which doesn’t really amount to much.\n\nGameplay: The game places far more emphasis on combat than on story, and you have to create your own characters, which means the only characterization for your characters is through the biography that you can create for them, and from the choices you choose in conversations. It’s not bad, though, (the story, I mean) nor is the gameplay, I just wish it wasn’t so Diablo-like. However, they added a new difficulty level, story mode, that makes your characters GODS so they can’t die and they whoop monsters easily. However, you still have to get enchanted weapons and armor if you want to harm or stand a chance against some of the monsters in the game. (Umber Hulks and Trolls spring to mind).\n\nMusic: Runs the gamut from peaceful and soothing to eerie and ominous to DANGER! RUN LIKE A MUTHA!! All the music, or at least most of it, sets the mood perfectly (when it’s playing) and every single one of them fits in with the atmosphere perfectly.\n\nGraphics: Dude, the graphics are all the same from the original Icewind Dale, so if you’ve played that, you’ll know what you’re getting into. The only thing that was really changed about the graphics is the resolution. Each of the character models and weapon models and armor models all generally look like something you would expect to see in a fantasy RPG setting.\n\nOverall, yes, I recommend this game, but if you’ve played the original Icewind Dale, then wait for a sale, because there’s just not enough new content to justify spending $20 on a game that only got a few upgrades and hardly any new content. However, if you’re reading this and haven’t yet played Icewind Dale in any form, then yes, buy it at full price OR at a discount. Either way, I think you’ll like it if you liked Baldur’s Gate’s gameplay and don’t mind sacrificing story for combat and gameplay.","May 1","true","39.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Icewind Dale is still great but they need to patch this game severly, too many bugs. Characters do the opposite of what you command them to do. For example i have to keep a constant eye on my mage, will have her cast fireball (or any spell),and i see the fireball symbol above her miniture pic indicating that she is in casting mode,and instead she pulls her dagger out and runs in like a fighter with only 30hitpoints and 4 armor class. Suicide! and this happens too often to the point that it makes me stop playing after awhile, this also happens with other characters. also characters freeze up in casting mode too often, characters stuck in place walking and left behind on the map by other rest of party,characters scrypt issue,fighter characters will juft stop fighting before killing target for no reason and just standing there like a sitting duck taking damage, ill regive command to hit that same target, and he will start to swing his sword again.. but then again he will stop before target is dead.. yeah the annoying,fustrated feeling when you play this game takes the fun out","November 30, 2014","true","81.1"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

I am also a big fan of Planescape: Torment.\n\nWhile it is true that Icewind Dale is more combat heavy and story light then those titles, it certanly does not make Icewind Dale any less intresting. I must admit I have never finished the original version of Icewind Dale, but I'm having more fun with this, then the latest big titles. Its familiar due to it being another infinity engine game, but absolutely new to me because I had never completed it.\n\nBeamdog did a pretty good job of enhancing the game. I love the quick loot bar, I love the zoom function, and I think the addition of the BG2 kits and spells is great. It would have been perfect if they would have added a minor expasion of home brew story content, just like Heart of Winter or Trials of the Luremasters did.

The original Icewind Dale is a good game and you should try to play it.\n\nI really would want to love the game, but I cannot. I played in original Icewind Dale and can tell that IWD:EE has a very few differences from it, but will cost you almost twice (!) more! Let's look more closely on Enhanced Edition features:\n- widescreen support. A really good thing, but you can download widescreen mod for free (because it's free mod from fan of original game) and get the same result;\n- brand new interface. Yeah got it, it actually looks nice;\n- class system from BG2: new classes for characters, new spells. But even Beamdog themselves telling, that they didn't change game's balance for this new system, because "IWD is a really hard game even without balance tweaks". Still not convinced;\n- bugs. We cannot went from it, can we? IWD:EE has bugs, many people that give the game a negative review telling about that. Original game have fan fixpacks, Enhanced Edition haven't. I myself encountered a very annoying bug with all animations being very-very slow and it never was a problem with original.\n\nSo I really cannot recommend the IWD:EE. Just buy the original one. It has pretty good tactical gameplay, marvellous mods, fun and challenging battles (battles are the center point of game, don't buy it if you don't like such things).\nBuy IWD:EE only if you have a good discount and you hate to mess around with mods. And maybe if you want to play your Icewind Dale on Android or iOS.","July 7, 2015","false","0.1"," 15 of 30 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","15","30","2","0"

That, and the lack of towns and all the interaction they bring, lower the final score. It makes the adventure seem to drag on a bit. Which is a shame.\n\nIf BG1/2:EE are a 9, IWD is a 7.5.

I like that it contains a variety of different spells and magical Items to play around with and has new options gameplay wise, such as a 6 person party. I found it generally more challenging compared to Baldur's Gate mainly because harder things were thrown at you early in the game (such as Vale of Shadows and Dragon's Eye) but story mode is an option to play by.\n\nAs a stand-alone game Icewind Dale Enhanced Edition is a very good example of a good DnD game, it abides by the 2nd edition DnD rules which means your actions are often made on a roll of 20, making it interesting and never quite the same every time. It's very interactive as it gives you many different options such as quests and who you can talk to, it's the sort of game that shows you should try and interact with everything just in case you find something really good.\n\nOverall since I didn't play the original it's hard to compare that to Beamdog's enhanced edition but it is relatively bug free and a good game experience and I highly recommend for any enjoyers of role play DnD games.

A mission based game, where baldurs gate was more open and focus on exploration this was the game where you created all your characters from scratch and gave your team a try. Pressing the "reroll" button nlimit times for attributs until you have the perfect characters.\n\nDough, since you are low level characters the ability to configure your stats after the hero is created is very limited. I think it's only the mage (or sorc (added in EE)) and the rouge (thief) that have the possibility to actualy pick something useful each level. The rest just level up (more hp - more damage). Luckily that was well improved in Icewind Dale 2.\n\nStill, it is a good game and worth playing through. If only reason is to play the more surperior game IwD 2 or playing the very good dlcs.

They are among the most memorable games I have ever played and I still own the old CDs to this day just for nostalgia's sake. I have not been able to bring myself to throw them away even if they are now completely obselete with the current modern operating software on most PCs...nonetheless, they are like valued memories from my childhood. So, with that up front statement, I am completely biased from the start when it comes to this game and thus I do not know how much this review should be valued for a newcomer to this old franchise.\n\nBeamdog... you're already preaching to a complete zealot on all things in this franchise, so I'm going to be throwing more money at you as long as you keep these games coming. I'm a happy camper so far.\n\nIf you're big into graphics, the engine is looking like, well, that it's from the 90s. There are prettier isometric games out there on the market. Still, the maps and surroundings look decent enough (considering the game's age) and if you're not big into graphics, well, who cares, right? Character animations and general appearance is pretty basic. Again, nothing special here.\n\nStory-wise, the plot is laid on very thin as an excuse for your party to be out there marching about. Let's be honest: this game is pretty much all about hack n' slash, getting loot and boosting your chraracters. If you want more of an engaging story, more character interactions, more decision making and more rpg elements, go for the Baldur's Gate I or II routes. IceWind Dale is purely a dungeon crawler... your choices are purely tactical and combat oriented. Actual towns or cities or interesting NPCs are scarce in this game-- indeed, most NPCs will just repeat the same lines over and over.\n\nAgain, for the folks who are heavy on RPG elements such as chracterization (i.e living, breathing characters), check out the Baldur's Gate installments instead. Your party of six custom created characters can feel bland at times with no backstory, no interaction with each other and a more limited series of voiced comments this time around. Still, if you have a fertile imagination you can brew up your own back stories for each character and come up with reasons for them banding together.\n\nMy story: my party is entirely consisting of evil aligned characters who are essentially a mercenary band who charge a fee for their services. They are there to make some cash; an escaped male drow elf former slave fighter who has nothing but hate in return for a lifetime of forced servitude to the matriarchal Drow community, Krogan Bloodaxe (the same bloodthirsty Duergar dwarf from Baldur's Gate 2), a grave robbing necromancer, Kurgan (Blackguard class) from the Highlander films and moxy Morrigan from Dragon's Age. So, as you can see, with some imagination and the ability to use your own custom portraits, you can make your party of six yours and original.\n\nI actually adore the Icewind Dale series because you get to create your entire party from scratch. Whereas the Baldur's Gate series only allows you to create the main character. You then have to recruit others during the campaign, many of them having crappy stats or just not fitting with your character (i.e having evil and good aligned characters can cause conflict, having evil recruitable characters be the weaker choice compared to the good-aligned characters etc).\n\nThis is where this game completely outshines even the more recent additions to the isometric gaming genre: The sheer number of options at the character creation phase of the game available to you. Lots of races and lots of classes and specializations for each class to choose from (you can even multi-class and dual class if you can't make up your mind)... it took me about three hours just to decide on the cast of colourful characters that I was going to bring along with me on this adventure (this includes searching the internet for cool portrait pictures). Sure, not everyone is as fussy about the finer points of character creation such as myself, however you will have to think strategically when assembling your party if you're using the higher difficulty levels. This in itself is pure fun.\n\nThis leads me into the game's other strong point: deep, tactical combat. This is a thinking person's game and not some pointless, grinding button masher. There have been endless arguments, debates and waves of volumes of material since the 90s dedicated to the best combination of classes and races for your party. Don't believe me? Do a quick search on the net.\n\nAll this said, this game may be just for you if you like what you have read.\n\nMy thanks again to you Beamdog for getting me back in touch with such a work of art!","March 12","true","40.1"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

So far the game has great music, a wide selection of classes, and approaches to creating parties, and has good voiceacting and writing.  A lot of the dialogue can be discarded as not useful - but the less you read the more likely you are to be confused later.  The mechanics are really dense so don't let that scare you off.  Do a little reading, or watch some video, and that should prepare you for a gloomy story and dangerous combat encounters that often leave you wondering WTF happened.

If you have a game with a wealth of dungeons and caves and crypts full of small tunnels and rooms it's decidedly not amusing to see the group split up when you send them the same way, when characters who are supposed to stay in the back of the formation run ahead and subsequently get blocked by the melee characters when an enemy strikes because they can't get past them.\nIt's also not amusing when goblins kill the paladin while the cleric, who is told to go and heal the paladin, gets stuck behind the rogue while there is plenty of room to go besides him left and right and instead of going around just stands there humping the rogue while the paladin dies. It's hard to control six characters when things like this happen.\n\nBut that, while aggrevating, is the only real thing I find really frusterating about the game so I'd still recommand it, though not as heartily as I would if the pathing was a little better.","May 5, 2015","true","43.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I played Icewind Dale when I was younger like many people and when I saw the EE edition I was thrilled. As a young boy I was terrible at the game and as an adult I was only slightly better! I would avoid Icewind Dale for several reasons but the game is still strong for certain players.\n\nWhat I didn't like:\n- Now I'm not an RPG isometric nut ball and I certainly don't know the DnD world that well. Character creation was fun when I was younger but it was a chore this time around. Making a decent party of the right amount of members was very trial and error for me. I'd advise a guide for this.\n- How many bloody enemies? Now maybe I'm terrible but the amount of enemies the game would sometimes surround you with was beyond a joke. It didn't matter if you kited them or fought them up front, you'd die. The game often made me exploit it by firing random fireballs into the dark to kill/damage enemies before they saw me. Doesn't seem very balanced.\n- Bugs or maybe a feature. In some areas you would return and the whole room would be repopulated after loading a quick save. This often put me in a tricky situation of getting out of an area to head back to heal. Keep an eye out on the game pulling this fast one.\n- Backtracking. Now I'm sure this comes down to my inexperience of having a terrible cleric or whatever but having to backtrack each time I need 1000x health potions or to revive at a temple was beyond a joke. Backtracking is never fun and Icewind forces you do to it...a lot.\n\nThings I liked:\n- Blast from the past, it was great to see a game that I adored when I was a child on steam. I can't say it was worth it for the nostalgia but I gave it a shot.\n- Spells - The different spells of the mage was a great feeling, I didn't use them much when I was younger so it was nice to experience this character.\n- Environments, there we're plenty of different areas to explore that felt different in their own way. This tied into the story which I enjoyed even though the fighting part of the game took a way from it.\n\nSummary:\nI would only buy Icewind Dale if you want a blast from the past or you're seriously into your roleplaying games and understand different elements of character creation. This would probably make the game pretty easy but I found is very hard but luckily made it to the end. Give it a shot if you have the patience.","January 31","false","36.4"," 5 of 14 people (36%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","36","5","14","0","0"

I play a lot of Baldur's Gate. I enjoy the characters and the journey of creating one focus main character that has a history and is deeply involved in the central plot. This game is a little lacking in that department. It actually doesn't even deal with it at all. It's very beautiful and it's full of Dungeons & Dragons lore which I love, but it's basically a little lazy from a player's perspective. You're an androgynous party that just happens upon the most epic time ever in the history of ♥♥♥♥ all Spine of the World. It's pretty intense. You just happen to be the most brutal kick ♥♥♥ party this territory has seen. They do their work. The actors and the writers make the events exciting and interesting, but it doesn't suck you into the storyline quite as easy as the "Gorion's Ward" does.\n\nOn the plus side, if you really want to lick your chops and get into Dungeon's & Dragons awesomeness, this is your game my friend. But who has time for that ♥♥♥♥, in this darned and dirty time ♥♥♥♥ed world? Baldur's Gate still trumps the storytelling, but this is a wonderful addition. The added feature to export characters and try out quick level builds is a nice touch, and a personal chakarazer thank you for that goes out right there.\n\nOverall, I can't recommend this to the general consumer. A+++ from me personally, and that's a lot of proficiency points, but a big fat downy thumb for ol, jonny browse.\n\nAlso, when constructing a party for this game. Also a counter argument-to the afformentioned idea of how you can still get sucked into the game world mechanics, this game encourages developing the strongest six person party one can take to tackle the frozen tundras. I would recommend a bard in your party. Personally, I'm a "bard in every party," as a standard rule of thumb anyway. It doesn't hurt to always hang out with hot cheerleaders, you know what I'm saying brother? But yes, in the game the bard is extremely useful. Later on, a standard bard can learn the March of the Sith song, it has regenerative powers, AC bonuses, and overall use's the ♥♥♥♥ing word Sith in it's name, so.\n\nNo bard would make an advisable alternative for those seeking a challenge.\n\nAlso, excellent character classes to have in your party:\nUndead Hunter Paladin\nAvenger Druid\nSorcerer (Dragon kind is a good option)\n\nAny good tank is usually a cleric of some kind. I personally leveled up a fighter with high wisdom until I liked it and dual classed a cleric then exported it and started over. He is quite powerful.\n\nAt the time of this edit, I've found no discernable use for a thief in the party. It's possible to go without.","December 21, 2015","false","103.1"," 7 of 19 people (37%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","37","7","19","4","0"

In BG:EE and BG2:EE you had a huge world to explore and lots of side quests and chains.  You could immerse yourself as much as or little as you wanted.\n\n- All stores sell gem/scroll/potion/ammo bags.  One of the main stores even sells a bag of holding (get it)!  Why does the party need an essentially infinite inventory space?  Because the story is on rails so going back to the town to sell items only happens a few times.\n\n- Difficulty just keeps ramping up.  With its linear story, they just make each area a bit harder than the previous and add more enemies attacking at once, which is boring.  In the BGs, if an area is too tough you do side quests in easier areas to level up or get special gear and enemies had specific abilities to make them a challenge.  In IWD they added a difficulty setting because there's no option but to go forward.\n\n- There's lots of places where the developers just made it annoying on purpose.  Like several of the maps if you explore them in the wrong order then every monster is alerted and comes straight for you, so game over.  What's worse is you can quicksave while unbeknownst to you they are honing in on your party, and if you haven't been saving often enough you'll have to start over from a long way back.\n\n- The story is insipid.  By the end, they are almost literally insulting you and your characters for playing along; it's not *quite* as bad as "it was all a dream", but close. And I hardly can even remember any of the characters because they are inconsequential and bland.  There's no stand-out characters at all, like say Jon Irenicus or Bodhi.\n\n- The variety of equipment and enemies and settings is very small compared to BG2, and sometimes the selection seems purposely designed just to be annoying.  For instance there is only *one* weapon than can kill trolls sold by any store (buy it first thing).\n\nBeamdog has done a great job with the technical parts, but they can't fix the bad original design and concept.  I went back and played through most of BG2 with a single character party because I loved the story and loved the challenge of that, but IWD I wish I hadn't even played the one time.\n\nedit: only 0.5 hours because I played it in offline mode.","May 21, 2015","false","0.5"," 28 of 63 people (44%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","44","28","63","2","2"

You get to make a party of 6 characters so there is a lot of roleplaying elements as far as that goes. It has a decent story and provdes good dungeon-crawler gameplay with item management.\n\nBe warned though: the first part sucks. That's because low-level characters in 2nd edition D&D are essentially wet noodles. Here is how the game is for the first 2 chapters:\n\nEasy difficulty: every enemy dies 1 one hit and you always hit. Never get hit.\n\nNormal difficulty: 40% chance to stealth = 0% chance to stealth. Hit enemies 50% of the time and get hit 100% of the time. You die in 1 hit.\n\nCore Rules Difficulty and Beyond: impossible.\n\nThe difference between the difficulties decreases when you get higher level though. Just be warned that you have to slog through boring luck based gameplay for a bit before it actually becomes tactical. I think the rules are a poor adoption of real life pnp D&D because I never had this problem while playing pnp.\n\nEDIT: I wrote the review a bit hastily. I came back to it and tried to play all the way through. Let me just say this game is not what I remember it was. The whole thing is one long dungeon crawl with plot points that are really thinly veiled exuses to send the party off to another ridiculously long dungeon crawl where you hack your way through 1,000 interchangable enemies such as skeletons, lizard men, whatever "the new flavor of the day" is. You'll go in, clear a few rooms, then have to run all the way back through town, which sometimes 10 or more minutes over several layers of dungeons to rest and/or buy stuff.\n\nIt's the most boring gameplay for an RPG I've ever seen. At least Diablo had town portals and refilling mana bars so you don't have to rest. I don't know why I ever thought this game was good back when I was a kid. I'm guessing it was probably because I hadn't had much exposure to rich narratives and meaningful choices yet, like those found in Torment or Fallout. Once you've had top shelf booze, you really can't drink bud lite anymore if you catch my drift.","November 19, 2014","false","24.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"
