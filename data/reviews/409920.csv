I just found it yesterday through Dodger on YT and had to rush to buy it. The diverse races and sexual orientations for its characters set this apart from a lot of other games. Ash, Prude, and the gang all feel very real and the voice acting cast is really good too. I'm finding myself craving another chapter and look forward to supporting this game in the future.","November 14, 2015","true","7.0"," 60 of 64 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","60","64","2","0"

From watching the trailer I wasn't sure whether the story would be entertaining, and I had some reservations about the voice acting.

The world draws from some classic tropes and mixes them together in a lovely blend. And yet, despite how unique the setting is, exposition never bogs down the dialogue. The writing explains things naturally, without feeling rushed or full of itself. With the exception of a few moments, every plot twist or character motivation makes sense.\n\nBrilliant Shadows is marked as book one. I worried this would mean a cliffhanger ending, but that’s not the case. The ending leaves you wanting more without feeling cheap, just like the first book in a great fantasy novel trilogy should.\n\nEven if you’re not a huge visual novel fan (I’m certainly not), pick this up.\n\nOh, and the blooper real at the end is amazing.

Presenting a very different world from the norm in most media, with Necromancy not necessarily being evil but instead another school of magic that's balanced out by Light magic, the game does a good job presenting the basic principles of the world at a good pace, and the player also gets the opportunity to learn more about the world if the right choices are made.\n\nI learned that the voice acting in the game (FULLY voice acted) was actually a stretch goal of it's kickstarter, and I have to say it helped breath life to the characters, and it was quite refreshing to hear new and different talent in an industry that sometimes feels only a handful of voice actors are always given work. (I hear voice actors like Jennifer Hale and Steve Blum across a LOT of titles, across different mediums, and while definitely great voice actors, it's once again so refreshing hearing new talent).  While the writing can also stand on it's own, the acting definitely helps you understand what kind of personality each character exhibits, and makes them that much more memorable. From the character designs to the backgrounds, the artstyle is also beautiful to look at, and speaks of the artist's talent in presenting this world and the people who live in it.\n\nThere are some games, or even TV shows, that you can play or watch for a while, and then you need to take care of something else. Then there are others that grab your attention so much that you forget where the time went, or you're compelled to finish in one sitting. This is one of those games. I finished my first playthrough until the wee hours in the morning (totally worth it xD). I'm so glad this is part one, as I cannot wait to see what else this indie dev will bring out next in the story.","November 17, 2015","true","6.5"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

I think I may have played a grand total of 1. That being said I have read many a book and have a craving for good solid story.\n\nFrom the very start of this one, we see a well done style that looks like a painter has just left the easel to dry and it catches the eye. I even praise the colors used that really draw the eyes and help make the characters simply LOOK unforgettable.\n\nThe story setting has enough of it's own lore that I want more, and not even just from the main characters. There were several smaller mentions of things that I would love to see explored in other ways, even as small as a short story or something of that nature.\n\nThe main character goes through a few points where it is difficult to like her, however, during these points her actions and mannerisms really sell what she is going through and seemed like very human responses. Being honest I think I only felt that way due to her being upset with a character I found very charming!\n\nThe relationships felt real and there were a few times I expected the story to focus on some of the negative emotions of a character for longer than needed and I was pleasantly surprised that the development felt organic.\n\nThe ending leaves alot of questions, but its very clear (the title..I mean..) that this is but one part and that we can expect to see more. It doesn't leave on a cliffhanger so much as a hope for the future of the characters.\n\nIf you like visual novels, I gotta say to give this one a try, worth your time and money.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/diazflac/recommended/409920/","diazflac","diazflac","http://steamcommunity.com/id/diazflac/","688 products in account","As Brilliant As The Name Suggests\nAn excellent visual novel. As a backer from their kickstarter campaign, I had high hopes after sampling Ithaqua Labs' prior work, Jacob's Island, and after finishing my first playthrough of Brilliant Shadows, I am delighted with this game. Suffice to say my expectations were exceeded.\n\nIf you have never played a visual novel style game before, or even if you have and maybe didn't take to it very much, I think Brilliant Shadows is a great starting/re-entry point to visual novels in general.\n\nIt is very well presented and well written. Characters are believable and relatable. You start to feel for their predicaments with surprising ease, and the story sucks you right in.\n\nPlaytime for a single playthrough took upwards of 3 hours for me, which is fairly good for a visual novel game. As it is not a so-called "kinetic" novel (one with a single story and no branching paths) there are thankfully multiple paths that can be taken, and multiple endings to receive, so this will increase play time considerably. Even assuming you use the skip feature on subsequent playthroughs, getting all the endings is likely to take at least 5 hours or so I would guess. Playing through it normally, probably more like 8 or 9.\n\nI was graced with Ending #1 upon my first completion, and it was quite a satisfying one. Despite the "Part One..." in the game's subtitle, while it is clear there is more to come in future games, this first part doesn't exactly leave you hanging either. It felt like a satisfying place to end the first "book" if you will, and since there are multiple paths in the story to take, I look forward to seeing the significance of the other available routes and endings in subsequent replays of Brilliant Shadows.\n\nWithout spoiling anything, I'll just say the final moments of Ending 1 and the epilogue were quite touching, thanks to a very creative surprise twist.\n\nAll spoken dialog lines in the game have actual voicework, and it was well executed. The voices took me a bit to get used to at first, but that sensation quickly faded.\n\nUsually adding voices to visual novels is a bit of a gamble. The quality usually ends up polarized from what I have seen, but those fears are unfounded in this case. Everyone did a great job with their delivery of the lines, none of them seemed unnatural or like they were a poor fit to their characters. It all just worked out quite well, and I hope to hear more from this talented cast in future Ithaqua Labs games.\n\nArtwork was incredible. There's really no beating around the bush there. Characters, background scenery, UI flourishes, CG scenes, animations....all of it gorgeous and very fitting to bringing the world to life. Just excellent.\n\nThe music score was pleasing as well. It felt fitting to various scenes. While I didn't get the feeling that it stood out as incredibly memorable per se, it also didn't need to be. The important point for me to drive home is that it wasn't distracting. It didn't feel out of place. It's a good solid score for evoking and complementing the scene-appropriate emotions, and I really have nothing bad to say about it.\n\nI highly recommend Brilliant Shadows. It has all of the things a great visual novel should, and I'm eagerly (but patiently)  awaiting Part Two of the Book of Gray Magic (and part three? four? .... alright I'll stop being greedy.)\n\n","November 7, 2015","true","11.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","4"

The art is excellent and the writing is on point, all of the characters feel fully fleshed out and well developed. The novel has a combination of action, humor, and romance. I have never been much in the form of romance anything but it is well done. The real draw for me are: 1) The world is rich and clearly designed with a larger story arc in mind (which I am greatly looking forward to), 2) The fantastic art style with fully detailed sprites, varied backgrounds and wonderful CGs.Each character is fully voiced and there are multiple endings making the product feel really polished.  There are a ton of little elements that show the love and care that went into the game, one of my favorite is the blooper reel at the end.\n\n100% would recommend to fans of visual novels and would heavily suggest that people like me who have never played one consider starting with this one.

But, after picking this up, my entire view has been thrown against the wall. While originally I was concerned that adding in visuals voices to character would take away enjoyment, I have discovered that instead being given a concrete step upon which to envision my characters was refereshing. And I haven't even got to the story itself. Going into this, I was unsure as to if this was going to be a rather generic fantasy story, but BS's (Yeah, great initals for a game right?) openess and more realistic approach to topics such as homosexuality and love had me much more inthrawled into the different characters relationships. And being able to control the main characters actions stripped that sense of when you read a book and you cant tell exactly what's going to happen because a character does something and then spending the next five minutes whining about their stupidity.

It's very well done and really helps the characters come alive. The art is great, sort of Burtonesque instead of the typical anime style, and even the most minor side characters have unique sprites. The UI is a little awkward (I consistently had trouble finding the hotspot for save slots), but the text is large and easily readable.\n\nThe story feels very much like an introduction to a series. Most of the plot is focused on developing a small part of the setting, and then an epilogue abruptly shows a window into a larger world. It's also very linear; choices can give you evil points (too many and you get the bad end) and sometimes branch off into an extra scene, but the overall plot stays on the same path, and the good/neutral endings are very similar in both content and tone. Linearity isn't necessarily a weakness, especially since it leaves a clear starting point for the sequel, but saying there's three endings is kind of misleading.\n\nThat's a minor complaint, though. Overall, Brilliant Shadows is one of the best English visual novels I've played, It has a unique setting and compelling characters, and the writing, art, music, and voice acting all come together in a harmonious, beautiful experience.

The voice acting is well done and it's really refreshing to come across a fantasy that is as diverse at this one. However, for as progressive as it is I am a bit thrown off how other characters seem to treat Hektor.  I'm pretty sure he is suppose to be autistic and while I do think it is realistic that characters will be annoyed by him at times. It's a bit jarring to see people hit him and even describe him by using abelist slurs.\n\nI'm also disappointed with writing at times. There are moments where there should dramatic tension yet seems to be brushed off or ignored.  Two examples, I can think of this is when Prude finds out Hektor is a Gray Mage and is clearly upset about it, to the point of being brought to tears. Yet almost immediately in the next scene we see Prude seeming completely okay by it. Yes, time may have past but the audience still need to see how Prude came to terms with her lover being what she considers a monster. Also, the scene where Ash finds a dead gray mage in her room and the characters seem to talk about it as if they are discussing the weather??? The game tries to explain it away by saying 'they're use to it because it's been happening to them a long time' but this only has been happening to them for a few weeks at most.\n\nAlso the ending felt rushed. I also think that certain revelation in the end could have been saved for the next part of the game.   Ash suddenly being in love with Terra, even with the whole 'pairs' concept, seems unrealistic to me. That's something that could have possibly been developed better in the next part of the game\n\nHowever, despite my complaints the game does have an exciting plot that makes me interested in the next part of the game. And the characters are all interesting and unique which makes you truly care what happens to all of them, even the villians.\n\nSo, yeah. I think Brilliant Shadows is a cool game that needs just a bit more work with it's writing.\n\n3.5/5","November 18, 2015","true","3.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","2"

At the beginning the protagonist and her true love's relationship is set up very nicely, they're best friends since childhood and now that they're adults they're set to complete their magical bonding ritual which will be the beginning of their lives together.  It's great stuff, you're definitely invested in their relationship.  But something goes wrong, leaving your main character bonded to an alien (who you don't even really meet until near the end of the game) and your true love bonded to a super annoying dude.  Of course that's all OK, since, you would assume, True Love will overcome even the power of magic, and it'll lead to a great and happy ending, or so you would expect.  The problem is, at least in this game, True Love doesn't overcome the bonds of magic, you'll spend the entire game trying to overcome it, but you'll fail at every turn, all your choices essentially lead to the same depressing result.   Eventually your character is simply alone and miserable, and as a conclusion to this terrible story, the only two other lesbian characters in the game are revealed to be bad guys, and your character has to kill them.  But wait, after everything's been terrible and depressing the entire game, at the very end you meet the alien you're bonded to, and, since your character is going to be extremely attracted to it no matter what it looks like because of the power of the magic of the pairing ritual, it's a good thing that it at least appears to be female.  The end.  Of course, the Title suggests that it is 'Part One' so perhaps in the next game your character will be able to finally break the bonds of the 'pairing ritual', get away from the alien and get your true love away from the super annoying dude, and finally live Happily Ever After, but there's no happily ever anything in this Part One, so I'd suggest waiting to see if things get better in the next one before playing this one.","November 20, 2015","false","3.6"," 4 of 37 people (11%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","11","4","37","0","4"

Prude is a princess, and is the object of half the primary casts affections. Hek is stronger than the Heads of the school, and has powers that essentially have 'mary sue' written all over it. SPOILERS, DO NOT READ PAST THIS POINT: Ash's pairing partner turns out to be a changeling/elf thing, and not only does it handily solve the final confrontation, but it also saves their lives thruoghout the entire game, demonstrating overwhelming power and skill for no reason, this character, (as we have seen it so far) is just a straight up mary sue, she has no real negative characteristics, being an extremely power magical creature, when she meets her ash seemingly just decides that she is over prude, dismissing what had up until that point been a major plotpoint) to further reinforce this similarity to fanfiction is the 'pairing' itself, which anyone with a passing familiarity with the Harry Potter fandom will probably recognize as a extremely cliche trope of that genre, it's essentially just soul-bounding or veela mates or whatever other flavor they choose to call it that week, with the pairing making both parties stronger, as well as somehow magically determining that they are 'destined for eachother' or some bullcrap like that. This makes the overall story feel weaker, at least for me, but since it is the central conceit of the story I will overlook it.\n\nYou may have noticed that the (horribly rambly) paragraph above is very critical, yet this is a positive review, and there is a reason for that: Hek. Hek single handedly makes this game, his characterization is amazing, and while the rest of the plot is a load of BS Hektor is interesting enough to keep you playing.\n\nOverall it's story is nothing special, it's plot being a collection of cliches that have been overused so often that there is no way to take them seriously anymore, but it's still interesting enuogh to pick up.

In fact, I'd probably not pay attention to this game were it not for a YT vid showcasing it in my feed. But it instantly caught my attention with really polished production values for that kind of game- the artwork is detailed, pleasant to eye with good mix of earthy and vibrant tones and manages to vary enough to make it look like it's not all taking place in one white hallroom. The character artwork is animate and expressive (again, within the limitations of the medium- the horseriding sequence really could've used a separate character model) and the style fits the setting of the story.\n\nThe other thing I have noticed is the voice acting. That is, to my knowledge, a rarity in VN's, and most characters seem to be cast well. A few minor issues with delivery here and there, but nothing glaring. My one real issue would be sound volume- I assume the reason is that the VA's were recording in different studios, but some of the lines sound clear and crisp, while some sound muted or muffled. Still..it's fully acted and the three main characters are very easy on the ear (Hector's performance in delivering the deadpan lines was perfect).\n\nMusic is very good, and I'd gladly use it as a background for pen and paper RPG session.\n\nNow, as to the story itself, it's decent. The writing isn't Hugo-winning, but it got me invested into what seemed at first to be a simple  coming of age story. The characters are all easy to like, the plot flows fairly fast and without major stuttering, and it even manages to build good suspense, and there wasn't a single moment where I cringed...a feat that not all mainstream dev studios manage. The writers were well aware of the trappings of the genre, and delivered a solid story (not without some plotholes) within it. Solid enough that I definetely want the next chapter.\nI would also love for the world to be more populated. The Mountain seems to be existing in a desolate void. We know there's the kingdom, and in the last few minutes of the story we get rushed attempt as establishing the world, but still, a rough sketch of the world as known by the characters would be great.\n\nOne minor thing that was slightly grating: Dear writer,we get it. People of all genders, sexes and walks of life have the right to love and should not be prejudiced against. Pretty sure no one who disagrees with that notion will be playing this game, so...spare us the heavy-handed "only a primitive would" lines next time, it's preaching to the choir.\n\nDespite minor flaws, I'd still recommend the game if you want to read something nice, romance-themed and in fantasy setting. The visuals and soundwork are high quality, and the story solid if not breaking any new grounds. I'd liken the experience to Old Kingdom trilogy in terms of tone, or one of Gaiman's earlier novels, like the Stardust.\n\nDo not play if girls kissing girls and not kissing you make you upset.","November 22, 2015","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The art is gorgeous, there was a good build-up for suspicion, and some of the situations Ash got into were relatable. I was also pleasantly surprised I ended up liking Belinda. Hoping to see the next part soon, especially if it adds more context to the plot point towards the end of the story.","February 11","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For one thing, I don't think there were enough choices. It's a very short game. At times it gets confusing with the dialogue and POV (although that may just me be.) However, I do have to applaud the artwork. It's very Tim Burtonesque.","March 31","false","10.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As a bi woman, I usually wince a little at most media in terms of sexual representation: mainstream bisexual representation trends toward the "out of straight porn" variety and "lesbian oriented" media tends to shame or delegitimize bisexuality and there was none of that in this game. Combine that with an interesting fantasy universe (something that seems like a bit of rarity in VNs that I've seen), a cool and unique idea for a magic system, decent voice acting, and an actually hilarious blooper reel, and this game is definitely a good buy (especially at 50% off).","April 1","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Well... there are different endings: a bad one, a good one and a in-between one, which is actually better that the 100% good one.\n\nThe bottom line is that you should definetly buy this game, the voice acting and art are wonderfull. The plot, world setting quite original.","March 31","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The characters were very well and realistically written, each with their own style. Did the game not have voices, I would likely have been able to tell who was saying what based on how things were written. The art was beautiful, the acting was great, the music was superb, and the story was captivating.\n\nThe only issue I had was the music level being much higher than the voice level. It made it impossible to hear what characters were saying when a score reached its crescendo. But, the subtitles alleviated any real issue! :) Can't wait for the next game!","May 20","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
