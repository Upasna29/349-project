This nostalgia inducing bedroom acts your base of operations and where you'll be choosing from the four very different modes, starting with the very important main Arcade mode where you'll ease into your new digital life of aviary rescue.\n\nThe rules seem simple enough; navigate a seemingly never ending series of Pacman-like mazes while collecting the carefully placed eggs within its labyrinthine halls of neon twists and turns. For each egg collected an awestruck duckling trails behind in a line, eventually adding up into one long chaotic conga-line. Hitting the tail of trailing ducks ends your combo and loses you the line you've collected which severely reduces your score (this is about where I ragequit every time), so planning your route quickly and on the fly is especially important as you gain momentum with each success.\n\nOnce ducks are collected they need to be returned to their rightful targets on the current floor, which with the time limit taken into consideration becomes a mad dash against against the clock forcing you to pinpoint the quickest route to collect each one while avoiding running into your trail or walls. There are plenty of small tricks to toss into your routine once you've got movement down including wall slides and quick dashes around corners when your turns are timed to perfection. In the end what you have is one of the most hyperactive combinations of classic Snake maneuvering combined with the flashy, fast and addictive pathfinding of Pac-Man Championship Edition DX with even more split-second precision required.\n\nAside from the immense feeling of satisfaction, reaching different landmark scores in each of the three wildly different Arcade levels (from Beginner to the appropriately named Dessert stage) will net you some pretty sweet rewards in the form of new music jams to jam, new announcer voices ranging from rad to hilarious, tons of adorable concept art, and of course the different obtainable modes.  Though score is your main driving force in perfecting your zig-zag routes throughout each stage, this vast amount of awesome and usable unlockable content is sure to keep you going even deeper.\n\nPix as a character is just way too damn cute and suave in a creatively simple way, a way that the most iconic and memorable of gaming characters are portrayed. He's one of those video game personalities you don't easily forget, and stands out as a classic and memorable character just as much as the gameplay itself. Even cuter, possibly, than our retro mascot are the lines of saved ducklings and their attitudes matched only by the badass-ness of their savior cat, and in a game with such an overwhelmingly sharp and cool style they're just the icing on the cake.\n\nThe varied visual themes of each stage provide some serious eye candy for something of such a simple nature. Subtle changes from complex motherboard patterns to cold steel monochrome textures breathe life into the twisting mazes around you, as the eggs and ducklings you collect change with it. Crazy multicolored squares light up in rhythmic sequence like some kind of insane Disco Dancefloor set to hyperspeed, all the while the heavy and bass-y beats of Xavier Thiry's soundtrack pulsate in your eardrums. Despite its retro nature, Pix the Cat is a real assault on the senses.\n\nEvery dumb little mistake you make is for the better in Pix the Cat, because this is all about practice, endurance, and getting better all the time. With each new invigorated and admittedly rage-inducing restart of a level you come back with a clear vision in your head of what caused your downfall the last time and your new found perseverance will carry you to even higher scores, and in turn even crazier and harder modes. With the addition of a Ghost mode to play against your own past runs or runs of the developer, there's a whole plethora of ways to practice and continue bettering your score for what is the most endlessly replayable game around.\n\ntldr;\n\nIf Pix the Cat were an actual arcade cabinet at a pizza parlor I'd be flat broke by now and already exchanging my life savings for fistfuls of quarters. When it comes to modern arcade score-chasing obsessions, Pix is as good as it gets","February 17, 2015","true","9.6"," 48 of 54 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","48","54","3","11"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/330180/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Pix the Cat is such a bundle of classic arcade goodness it's a wonder it didn't come out in the 1980s. Well, from a gameplay perspective at least. The aesthetics are purely new millennium and surely drew some inspiration from the Pac-Man Championship Edition and Space Invaders Extreme series of games with its maze-based gameplay certainly calling the former to mind.\nThe core mechanic in Pix the Cat is simple and straightforward, and the difficulty comes in mastering it at higher speeds. The adorably stylized cat Pix races around a pulsing neon maze. As Pix you must run over rows of eggs, which instantly hatch into ducklings that stick to Pix’s tail as if he were a mommy duck. Once you collect some ducklings, small glowing targets appear in the maze that correspond to the number of ducklings following you. Once you deposit the ducklings on the targets you start to earn points, but the more ducklings you line up and subsequently drop off, the higher your score combo goes.\nSo basically it’s best if you can get a huge conga line of ducklings racing behind you, and the best outcome is to grab all of them on the current maze before lining them all up and placing them on the targets at once. This is where the challenge comes in. The longer your trail of ducklings becomes, the harder it is to keep from doubling back and running into your tail ouroboros-style. If that happens you lose all of your ducklings and your combo goes into the toilet.\nThe biggest twist, however, is the time limit. Unlike classic Pac-Man, the strict timer from Championship Edition has been integrated into Pix the Cat. You can’t take your time and circle a maze until your ducks are literally in a row—to get that high score, you need to go as fast and as deep into the game as possible. A cool helpful feature is that each subsequent maze is visible in the peripheral border of the current one you’re playing on.\nOf course, rote practice and repetition play an important role as they do in any arcade game. To go really deep into a set of maps you need to practically fly around each maze, cornering perfectly and avoiding smashing into walls to keep momentum. This is one game where long-term mastery is the only way to go far and get those big scores.\nThe graphics will be familiar too. Pix’s standard art style simply exudes retro affection. The mazes are constructed from thrumming, color-changing neon and Pix, his ducklings and the enemy skulls that populate the later mazes would look perfect on the side of an 80s arcade cabinet. The music is infused with the pulsing backbeats and heavy bass that would typically be blaring from the back of a Showbiz Pizza Place or Chuck-e-Cheese back in the day.\nIn the end Pix the Cat doesn’t rewrite the book on arcade games but it does offer a fresh, smart interpretation of those timeless ideas.\n\n","June 29, 2015","true","12.9"," 26 of 29 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","26","29","0","0"

Mix for 10 mins, and you end up with Pix The Cat.\n\nThe game is basically snake (old mobile game), with Chu Chu rocket style graphics and Pacman DX+ mechanics.  Good for a quick 10/15 minute blast, the concept is simple, as Pix the cat you have to collect eggs which spawn chicks that follow you. Walk over the targets to deposit the chicks and score... Seems simple enough.. Except..\n\nThe only way to get a decent score is to collect ALL the chicks first BEFORE you deposit them. Deposit them too early, and the remaining shells crack and your combo multiplier drops. Run into your own tail of chicks and all the remaining eggs crack your combo multiplier drops. Run into various enemies and all the eggs crack, and your combo multiplier drops.  The longer you can go without dropping your combo multiplier the higher score you can achieve, but also, the game gets quicker (hello pacman DX+). The game is played against the clock (arcade mode) so you have to choose the quickest path without trapping yourself. Get enough perfects in a row and it goes into fever mode, even higher scores can be obtained! (ps. scoring tip, in fever mode you can EAT the enemy monsters for even MORE SCORE).\n\nEach level is inside the current level, a warp gate opens when you complete a level (successfully or not) to the next level. This allows two way acesss, which in some levels is needed to complete the next level.\n\nOh about controls, you only turn when Pix is directly on the center of a square. You can pre-turn before that for a slight speed boost (sparks appear). Keyboard or D-Pad is a must, analogue stick really isn't going to cut it.\n\nThe game have a lot of unlocks, to get you to come back and have one more go. You are contanstly chasing the high score, with high score tables for local, friends and worldwide to conquer.\n\nThere are other modes, I haven't got around to playing them yet. Including a local multiplayer arena mode, which appears to be a bit like bomberman.","January 31, 2015","true","1.7"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","18","20","0","0"

To my mind, it's a very successful hybrid of Pac Man championship Edition and the good old Snake game. The gamplay is simple, well implemented and requires a high level of skill/accuracy/timing with additional benefit derived from learning the maze layouts. Scores benefit significanlty from flawless execution which further underline the need to perfect technique - again, true to the essence of a traditional arcade game.\n\nThe menu system is presented logically and the graphics colorful, with the whole experience not being overly 'cute'.\n\nThe sound (something often overlooked in many games) is excellent and adds significantly to the enjoyment - it's one of the high points of an already extremely fun game.\n\nOn the down side, it doesn't play particularly well on the 8 way joystick I have in my arcade cabinet. If you're using a joypad or even a keyboard, you should be good to go.\n\nPix the Cat is wholeheartedly recommended, particularly if you see it on-sale or as part of a bundle.

It’s also much harder.\n\nThe goal of each board is to grab all the eggs, then walk over every circle. A chick will hatch out of every egg you touch and start following you, forcing you to play Snake until you can drop them onto the circles and get rid of them. For maximum points, you need to pick up every egg on the board before stepping on a single circle, turning most boards into a tough pathfinding puzzle. The most creative idea at work here is the way you can take portals back to previous levels at any time, which is sometimes required for playing optimally.\n\nThe biggest difference from Pac-Man, and the reason why this game is so hard, is because of all the sharp turns. There were no sharp turns in Pac-Man: every single turn was made at an intersection, giving you at least one extra moment to plan your turns ahead. Pix the Cat forces you to constantly make sharp turns while running at high speeds and painting huge swaths of the level with intricate space-filling paths if you don’t want to break your combo. As with all puzzle games which attempt to slide you smoothly across a fixed grid (like Chuck’s Challenge, some versions of Boulder Dash, and so on) it can be very difficult to tell when you’re properly “inside” a square and how long you have to make a turn, which is very much an issue here. Furthermore, each board is presented at a different zoom level and Pix is constantly speeding up, making it nearly impossible to judge turns by intuition alone. Your instincts will fail you unless you focus intensely on your every move. It’s very difficult and requires a lot of skill and practice, but fortunately the game was (at least for me) addictive enough that I was inspired to keep trying until I succeeded.\n\nThe boards are mostly the same every time, except for some small randomized details to mix things up, and you’re given 5 minutes (with no way to earn additional time) to clear as many boards as possible and earn a high score. It’s possible to memorize some basic routes that will work every time, but you’ll have to slightly adapt them depending on how the levels change, and you’ll have to earn speed if you want to progress further before time runs out. While it might seem like a dubious design choice at first to have all of the levels be the same every time, you’ll be thanking the heavens for the consistency if you’re serious about earning high scores and getting those tough achievements. And if you want variety, the game comes with two more level sets of varying difficulties.\n\nAside from the main game, there are also two puzzle modes which honestly could’ve been games by themselves. My favorite is the Nostalgia mode, a series of 70 action-puzzle levels which adorably try to pass off the main character as a Felix the Cat / Mickey Mouse ripoff from the 1930s, complete with a sepia tone filter and authentic old-timey music. The other puzzle mode has you playing through 100 thinking levels, trying to find the optimum solution to each room in the least number of moves. It’s a bit slow compared to the other game modes, but the puzzles are respectable brainteasers with clever solutions. There’s also a multiplayer mode that I haven’t gotten to try, but it looks hilarious.\n\nOverall, it’s a worthy, addictive Pac-Man variant with tight (but punishing) gameplay, and it was given far more coats of polish than I honestly would have expected from a game like this. I’d recommend it to any gamer who has the type of determination and OCD that would inspire one to perfect a BIT.TRIP level, but probably not for the casual achievement hunter. I’d give it 20-30 hours of gameplay to 100% depending on how good your reflexes are.","February 1","true","21.4"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

They never feel tight and responsive enough for this type of thing. The question however is: Are the controls really that bad... or is it just the animation of the character you're moving that make you THINK that they're bad? Its jerky moves (twitching legs, mouth munching in pulses) make it very difficult to estimate when you're about to step on the next tile or when exactly you have to take a turn into another direction. Then there are the backgrounds that are literally spammed with everchanging colors. The grids keep shrinking or growing. Score flashes obscure your vision in the most crucial moments, but thankfully at least those cues can turned off in the options. The game is out to distract you right, left and center - and I'm afraid it's an effect that was born out of overenthusiastic graphic design than out of deliberate intention. Someone should have told the devs that less is more, especially with a game like this.

It even sorta has a similar vibe as that game with the art style.  However, turns out this game is a bit more challenging than Pac Man Championship Edition.\n\nFirst off, you are a cat moving through a maze. You eat eggs which then pop out little duckies that trail behind you.  Your job is to lead the duckies to a "drop off" zone without getting trapped by a long string of duckies. So far it's pretty close.  The thing is, each level is nested inside the one before it, so you end the level and a little vortex opens leading you to the next level.  You can even go back to previous levels by going through the same vortex again.  Sometimes you need to do this, and sometimes it just wastes your time.\n\nOh yeah, that was another factor here.  You're on a timer.  The more you play, the faster you go.  The faster you go, the harder it becomes to hit turns accurately (it's a matter of timing) and the more risk you run of being trapped by your tail of duckies like you would in the game Snake.   Another benefit to going faster is that your combo meter goes up which in turn makes your point value for everything go up.\n\nAlso there's the matter of doing it right the first time.  I mean, you can pick up one or two duckies and immediately drop them off, but you lose the "perfect" bonus doing that.  If you die with a long string of duckies behind you, you lose all those duckies (and drop off points) so that you can't get as many points when you finally finish the level.   The best way to win this game is to play it logically and precisely.\n\nEven still, there's a timer and ultimately when it runs out the game is over.  There are in-game achievements for getting to certain levels within the time limit as WELL as achievements for hitting a certain score.  I didn't see the steam popup saying I got an achievement though.  It was just an end of level thing that unlocked some artwork and music and other things.\n\nSpeaking of unlocks, there's a few game modes that aren't available from the start either. You have to hit a certain score to unlock these other game modes. To assist you in this you can use your best score run as a ghost to show you if you're ahead of schedule or behind and if you're following the previous pattern of egg munching or not.\n\nThe graphics look ok but I'm not a big fan of the art style.  It doesn't get in the way of the gameplay though and I guess it lends some atmosphere to it.  The music is very nice and helps make the menu screen look happy while adding a bit of urgency to the in-game levels.\n\nI haven't played this game a ton, but it's got a nice casual "pick up and play" feeling that will ensure I'll be able to grab it and go for 10-20 minutes at a time without a big time investment. In my old age I'm finding shorter game sessions to be better for me so that's a plus.  If you're looking for something that you can play for hours on end, I doubt this is the game for you unless you're extremely focused and very competitive.\n\nIt's a very fun game though, and well worth playing.","March 18","true","1.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The arguable showcase is the Pac-Man reminiscent Arcade. There are multiple similarities to the relatively recent Pac-Man Championship Editions in particular, with the whole game being on a timer, a rising speed meter and presenting a series of little boards for you to clear. And let's not forget Championship Edition DX had those little ghosts following you in a snake-like fashion.\n\nDon't get confused though, Pix is its own separate beast. The layouts of the map vary from labyrynthine to spacious, due to the queue of ducks following you after collecting their eggs providing enough problems on its own, and the "enemies" move in a very expectable fashion. With ducks disappearing when you deliver them to their destinations, this sounds like a rather easy spin on the formula. But then, the game very, very heavily encourages you, both by direct and major score bonuses and by reducing the speed/score multiplier meter when denied, to grab all the ducks on a single board before delivering them. This results in you controlling a pretty long "snake" for longer than you'd expect at first, and avoiding the destination points before actually acquiring the longest possible tail. This gets pretty crazy later on, with options opening such as reverting to previous board in to improve navigation and gain some space, or delaying dealing with ducks in order to chase down some enemies that are vulnerable while you're at your top speed.\n\nIt's a really nice score attack game.\n\nThere are also three other unlockable modes featuring similar but modified mechanics: turn-based puzzle pack Laboratory, real-time but slightly puzzling Nostalgia, and local mutliplayer versus romp Arena. All borrow at least the Snake-like part of the rules from Arcade and sometimes more, while also throwing in some changes and exclusive elements that wouldn't make much sense outside of them. These aren't as polished gameplay-wise as the primary mode, but they certainly aren't bad, and interestingly allow you to explore different genres of gameplay while still sticking to the same mindset present in Arcade mode. Interestingly every mode has a completely separate (maybe default?) look and feel which doesn't really appear to be needed for gameplay to work, but adds to the experience for sure.\n\nI have not noticed any performance problems, the game looks alright (seizure-prone people, keep in mind it's relatively flashy, especially in the main Arcade mode); I also liked the soundtrack.\n\nUnless you simply don't like action-based score attack games, I really recommend it.","December 21, 2015","true","27.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There's some input delay and I couldn't find a comfortable way to play it, which, coupled with the fact that I already find Snake frustrating (pathetic, I know), plus Fever Time covering everything in a rainbow shader, meant I ultimately couldn't handle Arcade mode. If you're like me though, the puzzle mode can still keep you entertained. Plus it's pretty.\n\n\nFurther critique of Arcade mode: I preferred Pac-Man Championship's approach, which had a high number of manageable boards that stuck to one gimmick each, unlike this game's small number of boards with level design that goes on for quite a while and is too complex and busy to understand in time to react. It feels like each of these rooms should be an independent level if they were gonna do this.\n(Hint: Despite the rooms rotating and even changing in each run, it's still memorizable: the strategy never changes for each room even if the layout does.)\n\nThey did do exactly that though, in Nostalgia mode, but that one has more specific and hardcore challenges to make use of the fact that you can play them at your leisure. The eggs often spawn in what I perceived to be random places (I didn't confirm) but since, unlike in Arcade mode, score doesn't matter, I think it helps make it replayable. Personally I'm still pretty bad at Snake anyway though.\n\nFinally there's Laboratory mode, which is a puzzle mode without much action, so it was a pretty good fit for me. Essentially it's a sliding blocks puzzle with the Snake mechanics mixed in, which I thought was interesting. Its biggest flaw is that there's no Undo, which I've come to expect from modern incarnations of simple puzzle games. I think it's missing because later on there's timed obstacles, but I find those unnecessary, so I think it was the wrong design choice.\n\nBattle mode? I have no experience with that yet, sorry. But I think it's like Snake plus the ability to fire pieces of your tail at people like ammo. Maybe that sounds fun, strikes me as similar to some party game minigames.\n\n\nThis could still be up your alley, if you really like score challenges and can take this game's speed! But beware, it absolutely crushed my mood whenever I missed a Perfect or cornered myself due to something dumb. I might come back to it once in a while, but I'll stick to Pac-Man Championship Edition DX+, since I value more approachable design.","November 4, 2015","false","3.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Time runs up and you're back to the beginning to try another round.\n\nBut it's not interesting enough to warrant that.\n\nThen again I've only played 25 minutes so maybe there's more too it. Multiplayer maybe only have the single missiles too.\n\nI played with DS4 controller but the analog sticks isn't good for this since they react slowly and eventually your cat speeds up. So I used the directional pad but they too are quite slow so it's a game where the keyboard likely wins.\n\nTL;DR: You likely have to REALLY love snake to bother all too much about it.

Collect a chain of ducklings and deposit them on designated spots on the field, and then in a weird aesthetic twist, go to the next level by entering a portal in the walls that shrinks you down ever smaller. Collect all the ducks before depositing them for a bonus, but don't run into walls or the chain following you. Starts with just one field to play, and lets you unlock progressive fields once you've pretty much mastered the current one.\n\nYou can also unlock a couple extra modes: a puzzle mode where you try to get a perfect run on a single field while only moving in full rows or columns, and a "nostalgia" mode that's basically straight up classic Snake, with some twists in the level design.\n\nIt's not quite the insane, perfectly designed adrenaline rush that Pac-Man CEDX is but it's a very interesting take on Snake and well worth a few bucks, i.e. as part of the Weekly Humble Bundle.","June 18, 2015","true","0.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The visuals are really nice 2D stuff with an "inception"-y zoom in to the next level, and some puzzles actually require you to go back up a level to snake around, pretty neat stuff.\n\nThere's two puzzle modes--one is a time-management frenzy with random eggs you have to dash to get to (kinda boring, but the old-timey animations are great), the other is a "use as few turns as possible" movement puzzle that has some headscratchers. They're a nice addition but not really the meat of the game.\n\nThe vs multiplayer is *great* fun, I actually like it as much or more than the main game. It's local same screen versus play, you collect eggs and shoot or charge-dash into your enemies to kill them with some power ups and silly stage layouts. It's all very tense and quick to pick up, reminds me a bit of Bomberman but with less blowing yourself up.\n\nIf you play local multi on your PC I recommend picking this one up just for that.\n","October 13, 2015","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, the game combines aspects of the classic 'waka waka waka' pac man style of gameplay, with the classic game play of 'Snake' from the old Nokia mobile handsets, but it has a charming twist to it.\n\nThe sound track is cute, but once you get into the game, it turns a bit more upbeat as you the annoncer gets overly excited with a slight violent streak. You progress in the game via a mandelbrot type of system, always zooming in, going deeper within each level.\n\nVery sofa frendly if you're into party games, super easy to pick up and play, hard to master.","February 7","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(From selecting game modes, to entering your name at the credits using up and down arrows)\n- Bad zooming, some levels are smaller, some are huge.\n- Insanely psychedelic coloring that constantly changes. Very distracting and makes the game unplayable for me. If you could turn this off,. I'd recommend this game. As it is right now it's just more annoying than it needs to be. (and yes, I went into the options and disabled visual feedback already)","April 27","false","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is very fun and has multiple modes. It runs on Linux and even runs great on my 2010 laptop with some settings changed. The only issue I have is with my Logitech F310 gamepad. After a couple of games I will notice lag and sometimes I will have the analog stuck pointed in the direction I want to go and the cat just won't move. This only happens after about 5 tries or about 30 minutes of gameplay. I just restart the game and it is fine again. It is a cheap controller after all. But other than that it works really good and is very fun.","May 29","true","9.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
