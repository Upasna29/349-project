"http://steamcommunity.com/id/player1kenny/recommended/397200/","player1kenny","Keeeennnnyyyy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/player1kenny/","105 products in account",""Be wary of the positive reviews"\nFirst thing that will bug you about this game are the hands..\nLet's just say they were better off not showing them in the first place.\n\nThey have jumpscares put into place that usually involve lights above exploding EXTREMELY loud for no reason,\nor just random female characters being slingshotted through you. You might find the serial killer scary, but he just has loud music play and if he's behind you he'll kill you without you ever seeing him because he runs so fast. Which brings me to another thing - you won't be able to outrun him if he ever catches a glimpse of you. So you have to avoid someone completely - without ever knowing where he is in the first place.\n\nThere is little detail to fill this huge maze-like map, and if you're not planning your exact route you can find yourself lost and running in circles. Most of your gametime will include looking for batteries for your flashlight that runs out way too fast, and dying repeatedly to the naked man with the axe that can somehow walk around this building in complete darkness with no problem.\n\nBut one thing to keep in mind is this game was put together by a bunch of students, so if you feel like I'm being a little harsh, by all means try the game out. I personally cannot recommend the game because it was not fun for me to play. It doesn't make you want to complete the game - especially since if you happen to step into the wrong hallway, you die and start over. There is no progression.\n\nEDIT: Here's my gameplay.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6p001SIpy4","August 31, 2015","false","0.8"," 79 of 94 people (84%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","84","79","94","4","0"

Your goal is to escape a prison run by Walter, a beautiful naked man, who wants to murder you.  But, beware!  Walter has NOT maintained proper care for lights throughout the facility, resulting in shreaking exploding bulbs that make your ears bleed out.  Some say the game makers are cruel Otolaryngologist (ear doctors).  Me?  I say Walter made the game, and I'm proud of him.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xx1_cAEC_uU","September 16, 2015","false","0.7"," 15 of 22 people (68%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","68","15","22","14","2"

Once I got to where it turned blue I couldn't get the door to open, no matter what I looked at, plus you move slower.\nIt's like he has superhuman abilities, he can see you when you can't see him, you can't hear his footsteps.\nIf you have your flashlight off, that should make it harder for him to find you, but it seems he finds you easier with it off.\n\nI know there's a ton more negative than positive, but it's still fun to play.\n","October 11, 2015","true","4.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","5","7","2","0"

I love horror what can I say...but some of these horror games lately just SUCK\n\nStarted it a couple weeks ago when I bought, it died almost immediately, and ran out of time. Gave it the time it deserved today....holy bjesus....\n\nLove the woman who flies through you randomly, I see her on the camera and she is bugged out through it like she is trying to get me through the lense. lmao\n\nAll the cameras conviently have lights on them, nice touch?\n\nThe killer who is like a blood hound, can find you in the dark, behind doors and, runs faster than a  chicken running through Ethiopia...\n\nIm watching the camera... zone back... insta-death as the killer was waiting for me to get done looking at the cameras? LMAO how nice of him.\n\nP1K said it a lot better already, check his review.\n\nFor future game developers, you may want this title so you can see what not to do.","January 10","false","1.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

What starts off as intially fun soon takes a turn for the worse with the constant restarting, recollecting and rethinking of your current strategy (the constant reviewing of the rubbery hands is enough to cause borderline paranoia in itself).  The map itself is vague and difficult to understand even though it says "Cell" on it (where you start off).  Batteries are one of the most important items needed in the game but at times seem to be far and few apart (one time I opened the lockers at the beginning near the cell and it rendered not even a single battery!) Bursting lightbulbs and pipes add a good touch to the psychological experience and jump scares (even after almost 9 hours of gameplay it still causes this scenario with me).  The concept of having stamina attached to sprinting was not well thought up as this is the only means to escape walter (which I did once by dumb luck!)\n\nA few things that could've fixed this game a bit is the following:\n\n1. Allow the players to save the game 1 time anywhere (then after this if they die make them start over completely).\n2. Allow for the use of environmental aspects (objects or items which could slow walter down)\n3. Dont make gamers sit through that extended scene at the end (where you're strapped in the chair waiting for him to kill you off as sometime it takes more than 10-15 seconds for him to show up). I found this to be constantly annoying and I could've already been making my way back through the game.\n\nIn the end, my verdict 3/10 at best\n\n","January 20","false","18.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I think its just the one) respawns randomly throughout the map. I'm not a huge fan of horror games where you can't fight back so I knew I wouldnt be crazy about this, but it is still cool nonetheless.\n\nPros:\n+Cool idea\n+Runs well, no framerate issues whatsoever\n+Interesting Story so far, although I keep dying before I can get any further\n+I like how interacting with items can put you in danger, stare at the map for too long and he'll find you.\n\nCons:\n-Once you see the enemy, you basically die as you cannot out run him\n\nOther Thoughts:\n~Interestingly enough there is no brightness option, which is weird since it's a horror game\n~Graphics are not great, but its also $5 so I can't complain\n~I wish there was something you could do when you see the enemy, perhaps theres an item later on that allows you to stun him for a while so you can get away.\n~Theres one ending I got where you get tied to a chair, however there appears to be a glitch or something as you sit there for a while before he shows up.","August 31, 2015","true","0.7"," 19 of 46 people (41%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","41","19","46","0","1"

It allows you to really get inside the mind of this person and psychologically drain yourself by roaming through the halls lost and confused (much like anyone actullay in that senerio.) If you're willing to sinc an hour in for anytime you play, you're going to have fun trying to survive. The jumpscares are cheap, but it reminds you to be careful and try your best to slink around each room quietly. In this fight of man VS killer it's always important to keep moving, stay equiped, and stay quiet. Because if you don't... an unstopable killing machine is coming for you. It's worth the money, in my opinon. But hey! if you want a more in depth viewing, or just want to have a few laughs then try watching my video. I plan on doing a few differnt parts and exporing new areas everytime. Anyway. Have a good one.","September 7, 2015","true","1.1"," 7 of 21 people (33%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","33","7","21","3","0"

I haven't even finished it myself... Still going at it.\n\nIf you're looking for a cheap, terrifying, and enticing game that gets you wanting to go at it again and again, I highly recommend this purchase.\n","August 31, 2015","true","0.2"," 10 of 29 people (34%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","34","10","29","4","1"

The instant I booted up this game, dare I call it that, experience, I knew my life was at a cross road. It was at that point I realized that two roads layed before me. I could have continued living the lie of life that is life without Deliverance, or I could choose the path of redemption, the path of our glorious naked white grown fetus man serial killer. I chose the later, and since then, I've cured cancer, polio, down syndrome, and of course, erectile dysfunction. Deliverance has become part of my family since then. The games manifestation is watching over me on those always lonely nights, it delivered my newborn child, (who turns out to have also been a genetic cross of Barack Obama, Adolf Hitler, and Nelson Mandela), it even told me that drinking, wont solve all my problems, only some of them.
