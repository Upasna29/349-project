It feels incomplete in some sense, and almost lazy.\n\nFor those not in the know, in the mobile version, kit/unit expansion was done through requisition purchases and in-app purchases (hereforth to be referred to as IAP), to buy cards packs.  These packs allow for you to get 3 cards, one marine and 2 items (with the chance for rare/epic cards).  This system made sense with IAP being a potential option for people who don't have the time to endlessly grind levels and get a chance at getting better marines or gear.\n\nI agree with the exclusion of in-app purchases, let me say that right here.  But without them, the way forward is unfortunately set to be a grindfest, with a pack at the end of every chapter.  Let's be honest, systems like these - with randomized rewards in a boosterpack like purchase are designed to encourage people to spend real-world money over and over on cards/items they don't need for the chance of getting something they want.  That's how it works with trading card games, that's how it works in mobile apps.  This system does not make sense in a premium game with no IAP, and as such should have been replaced with something else more fitting.\n\nMaybe non-randomised cards.  Gain more requisition per level like gold, buy a marine for X requisition, buy gear for X requisition.  Spend requisition on your existing gear to upgrade gear.  Meanwhile get exp on missions, level up and advance your marine.  And when your marine is capped, spend requisition to advance him to the next tier.  That's an example off the top of my head, and most likely would have been tweakable for a much better system than the one currently in place.  As it stands you get a small amount of req per level, can purchase tiny 3 card packs, and maybe trade in unused marines and items for small amounts of req, making obtaining better marines and gear a grindfest.  Not of the pleasurable kind.\n\nFurthermore, the 3 Enhanced Edition chapters are not complete, and do not progress past tier 2, while the other 3 go to tier 4.  Also, the graphics aren't even visibly that much better and there is still no multiplayer.\n\nTLDR: feels lazy, exp/buying marine system broken, incomplete bonus chapter rosters, still no multiplayer.  If you really liked the mobile one and want to grind your way through the game on PC go for it i guess...","October 16, 2015","false","9.6"," 456 of 559 people (82%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","82","456","559","12","23"

I purchased many of warhammer 40k titles like : dawn of war, space marine, regicide, space hulk etc.\nAs well i love turn based strategies like classics : Jagged Alliance 2, xcom etc.\n\nI'm very disappointed. And thats why.\n\nI'm writing all of this on the go while playing deathwatch:\n\nIt is very sad how greedy games workshop is. this is another unfinished game just to get money from fans of warhammer.\nIm a big fan of warhammer 40k since i was a child, but last times games workshop is making jokes of their fans i think.\nThey develop a tons of games and none of them are fully finished or polished enough to call them PC titles.\nOnly dawn of war series are pretty good when we talk about video games in universum of warhammer 40k. I'm not comparing Deathwatch to DoW these are two different types of games but i  just want to say that in my opinion DoW is only very polished and truely finished title for pc with lot of content and dlc's.\n\nDeathwatch in UNFINISHED, BAD PORTED FROM IOS version of the game.\nyou can see on screen "TAP" here or "TAP" here...??? whaaaat?? they even left commands from touch screens. You can see that also when moving the camera with "wasd" keys and moving mouse at once - really annoying.\n\nYes camera movement.. you must use 8!! yes 8 keys to operate the camera.. W A S D R F T and G... hmmmm / update : actually 10 keys on keyboard operates camera i forgot about Q and E.. lol really? i figured out that you can also move camera with different combinations of mouse buttons for ex. L+R, only R, only L and scroll.. why all of these functions and keys are not mapped to scroll wheel click-and-move??\n\nAbilities are mapped to numbers on keyboard.. but first you must learn all abilities and make sure you will remember what icon of ability means because during mission there is no explenation or even name of abilities.. just images?? for example you can burn all your squad with flamethrower just by clicking the icon of ability because there is no pop-up explenation what will happen after using it..\n\nNext thing is Enhanced Edition. ITS A LIE!! Enhanced means in this case - you can get 12 cards more - worthless cards from tier 1 and 2. ( the system of marines and perks is card like). So in theese 12 cards should be marines and gear for 3 brand new chapters in the game. split 12 for 3 chapters and you get 4 cards per chapter.. yes.... very enhanted edition ;)\n\nGraphics?? Unreal engine 4? are you kidding me? or maybe games workshop thinks that im a stupid mo-ron? "EPIC" preset looks like ... LOW.. its 2015 or 2005 ?? ( i7, 16gb ram, gtx 960)\nI'm not able to turn on vsync.\nThe textures looks flat.\n\nLags (game freezes for about 2-3 sec) - always before "chit-chats" between marines, sometimes between turns or during turns)\n\nmusic? this boring something make you feel like you want to go to sleep. only one sound loop repeated over and over. I was supposed to cammand a marine squad - elite soldiers, i would like to hear some music to feel the fight.. ah and you are not able to turn off the music..\n\ngameplay screen.. another thing that will make you scream why ONLY PORTED FROM TOUCH SCREENS.?? no informations about accuracy, or anything else. nothing on the screen.. you dont know who of your soldier is who - no portraits.\n\nNO minimap - in missions where marines are split on two sides on the map it's hard to remember every position of enemy when a lot of enemies are rushin from all the sides.\nOn the other hand all of maps are very small (smaller than in space hulk) so you will probably be able to live without minimap..\n\nNO LOAD / SAVE OPTION ? you just play through..... yyyyyyy no place for mistakes or play "for fun". you must always be veeery serious about playing.... but on the other hand when you fail your xp gained from earlier battles (free xp - not split between abilities and stats) gets reseted. maybe thats why there is no save / load?\n\nAssault Champion from ultramarines chapter during battle is considered as Blood angel chapter marine.\n\nSpace marines are moving like wood.. yes you have an elite squad of trees on your command ;)\n\nThe animations when tyranids are being shot to death... eeeee... yyyy... is it a GIF?  believe me theese animations are VERY BAD..\n\nAnimations of explosions (not caused by marines) in game are really pain in the eyes.\n\nEnemies are very predictable. They just rush on you. Bigger ones just stand in one place.\nlittle variety of enemies.\n\nNo cover system? why? this game would be far more enjoyable with cover system.. Because of that major mistake game from the tactic point of view looses a lot of potential.\n\nno multiplayer..\n\nno skirmish..\n\nhow to start another new game?\n\nGOOD SIDES OF THE GAME:\n-card like system for getting new marines and gear (something new in warhammer i guess)\n-xp gain system\n-leveling up system\n-marines from different chapters are talking to each other during missions.\n-Marines statues in browser before combat - this is only thing that looks really good when we talk about graphics in this game.\n-shooting animations\n-water animation and reflections\n-dust in the air "effect"\n\n\nThis game has a potential.. and maybe gamers who dont really know how warhammer 40k games should look like will like it. but if it is about me as fan of warhammer 40k universe.. dont event try this for this price.. it should cost max 7euro..\n\nREALLY DISAPPOINTING GAME.. RIPPED OF THE TOUCH SCREENS AND NAMED "ENHANCED EDITION".","October 18, 2015","false","26.2"," 179 of 222 people (81%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","81","179","222","9","8"

Interface remains mobile (tap, swipe) and no UI changes were made that I can tell.\n\nGraphics are great for Ipad or Iphone.

This was a mobile game and it shows. The fact that this costs over 20€ is absurd. Only get this if you're a die hard 40k fan boy/girl. It's really a shame because this game has a good vibe. The devs clearly know their lore and are enthusiastic about the universe. If only this was made with a bigger team and a bigger budget.\n\nThe Good:\n- Nice art. The planets look and feel different. The space marines look bad ♥♥♥.\n- Functional turn-based combat. It's really basic, but works fine.\n- All weapon classes are significantly different and have synergies with individual space marines.\n- The chapters look and feel different. Sometimes they even banther with each other during a mission. You get different results depending who you have with you. Rank also matters.\n\nThe Bad:\n- XP system is flawed. You can basically farm experience on many maps. Enemies spawn endlesly and can be killed before they do any damage. Without farming, progress is really slow. Also Marines come in 4 ranks. Higher ranked marines are just plain better than your lower ones. But you need to level them up from the beginning if you want them to shine. This pretty much mean you need to grind xp if you want to upgrade your squad. You get 1 random marine in a card pack. More on this subject on the looting topic below.\n- No sound options. DansGame\n- Game breaking bugs on launch.\n- Loot system is really bad. This was originally a mobile game with microtransactions. You bought packs that gave loot with real money. This game has those packs as well, but you get them by completing a set of missions. The packs and mission rewards are random so you can get the same ♥♥♥♥ over and over. That means you have to grind if you want the good stuff. You can also buy those packs with an in-game currency, but the economy for that is horrible as well.\n- Animations are really slow and cannot be skipped. This applies to cut-scenes as well. Enemy animations can be made to go faster, but your's can't. This will get frustrating later in the game.","October 19, 2015","false","8.1"," 82 of 95 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","82","95","0","0"

It's their first serious go at converting a paidmium title from IoS into a truly premium experience that doesn't necessitate further payments on the Steam platform, and in doing so they've rebalanced the economy, converted the graphics engine over to UE4, given the graphics a serious spitshine, as well as gone over the various UI systems to make them keyboard and mouse friendly.\n\nIn Deathwatch you control a team of five marines (Stop me when this starts sounding familiar), trudging down narrow corridors, setting up killzones and killing tyranids who charge into your firing range as they swarm towards you en masse, praying you mow them down quicker than they spawn towards you, and they will come in floods, so eventually you'll be overwhelmed. The trick is to finish whatever the mission is before you end up as Tyranid nom nom. All of this happens in a top down, turn based singleplayer environment where you spend AP's on each marine setting up overwatches and taking shots at opponents using probability to hit.\n\nHang on! I think I HAVE heard this before...\nSo. To recap. Small team of heavily armoured SPESS MAHREENS. Narrow corridors. Tyranid threat. Chance to hit. Turn based. Swarms of them. Few of you. Sounds like Space Hulk doesn't it?\n\nThat's because barring a few changes here and there, you'd be forgiven that you were playing a very polished version of Space Hulk, at times you're more or less doing exactly that, just with a mixed chapter of space marines and without a librarian or psyker to back you up (which sucks). The marines move pretty slowly and are clunky buggers, with overwatch limiting them to a ninety degree cone of fire. Setting up overlapping killzones is order of the day and making sure their backs are protected so tyrannids don't -eat them- is sortof vital.\n\nThe best of the Emperor's armaments...\nUnlike the Space Hulks that are already on steam, the levelling system has a little more finesse, taking cues from Dark Souls, where here you won't permanently lose a marine if he's downed, but you WILL lose any unbanked XP, it's a clever system, ensuring that you're always balancing risk with reward, and as the later levels get tougher, you'll need to string together multiple wins in order to power that marine through the later stat boosts. Additionally you can further customise the Marines through their wargear choices and their weapons, the latter has a noticable visual effect which is a nice flourish.\n\nMarines too, visually distinguish themselves from one another, with higher tier marines having more detail than their cannon fodder baseline cousins. The loot system is all held together by a "card" system which awards you cards for missions completed, and the chance to earn points which can be spent on card packs of three which can yield some very high end gear and marines for your deathsquad. All of this hangs together well, and gives both a sense of interest and progression, since there's always the chance of landing a high tier marine that could really help your squad or a really neat bit of loot that you can equip.\n\n... and the worst of the Emperors decisions...\nHowever, counter to this is that the game has a really perfunctory mission structure, with short,  mobile focussed missions that are very, very bitesized. I got through the better end of twelve missions in an hour, only to be stuck with a bug that locked me up for ages and had me sending mails to the developer whilst I waited for my save game to get sorted out. This is NOT a long game, and worse, there's no random mission generator as there has been in say, Rodeo's other games (Hunters 2 springs to mind), so the longevity of this title as is, is deeply suspect.\n\nThen there's the so called enhanced content, which includes additional marines from the other chapters, except it doesn't really, because they've only included tier 1 versions and a tier 2 veteran along with tier 2 loot for one item. In short, for building a high end team, you won't be using the enhanced content for anything other than flavour, it's a stunted, unfinished tree that desperately needs fleshing out if it's to feel as complete and as enhanced as Rodeo claims on the advertising blurb.\n\nClosing thoughts\nThis game is tricky. Part of me wants to like it, because there's the soul of a good Space Hulk game in here, but as it stands? It's not -good enough- to recommend to the public as is. Therefore I recommend with strings attatched. At the price point being asked, I would wait, because they're asking too much for what's on offer. With the enhanced content fully fleshed out, that would justify the pricing, but it's not, so right now this is strictly a "For the fans" game. Otherwise, hold fire, wait for the inevitable discount.\n\nVerdict : Wait for a discount to hit, then get it. This particularly applies if you do NOT own Space Hulk and would like to try out a Space Hulk type game\n\nWriter and columnist for Just Reviews, where you can get similar fine reading material.

Naff all detail to be seen, nothing on screen bar billy basic icons that look like visual basic info boxes.  No turn number, no marine icons, no info in battle or after a battle on what or how many mobs they killed.  Nothing but bland, boring icons at the bottom that do not even have any information on mouse over what they are!!!.  You cannot even turn off the music and only way is to just delete the music folder in the games directory works just fine.  Naff all options for setup and KB settings are a joke.\n\nThe logic for play is to basic by far.  I can understand designing a simple game for simple minds with big wallets but this is not good enough for many PC gamers as we like more than 2 buttons to press and dam sight more information on what is going on when we play.  No way would I say well done for a great port when this should have been a pure PC title being its GW and 40K not some cheap crap that floods steam store .  Also its not worth £17 more like £10, its not like they made any real effert with the port as it stands.\n\nThe claims for the rewards after battle and even the level of loot to be gained I would take with a pinch of salt, my 1st 3 looted items was the same bloody T2 hand flamer then 5 times after that the same bloody power axe, also it seems odd when you sell an item it does not matter which tier it is they all sell the 4 credits  each,  so a T1 item is the same value as T3.\n\nThe only thing I do like is the weapon FX and sounds they make, as least the sound engineer knew what he was doing, the models and animation fit the bill but then how can you go wrong with material that has been around for over 30 years, the maps/lighting/control  are well below an average standard for a PC game on a larger than an IPad screen.  Shame realy when you incrrease the size of textures bigger than a mobile phone screen it just goes all crap.  So much better to port down than up as you can not add what was never there.\n\nCannot see any mob AI at all, all it does is spawn mob and head strate for player, on one map I just camped the bridge near the exit point till all my marines got over 30k exp each then purchased all the skill/traits once the map finished when I decided I was bored enough to move the marines over the exit icons.  How simple would it be to add at least a timer to cap the exp given on any map, but no, that seems to hard a thing to do.  But then the logic is written for an Ipad and no way would they sit there for hours on the same map camping as there batteries would die.\n\nOnce last point is the CPU untilization for this was using 2 cores at 100% constant, why? out of my collection of 600+ games installed this is the worst I have seen, its not like its doing much.\n\nUI 1/10\nMusic 0/10\nMaps 2/10\nSound FX 8/10\nModels 8/10\nAI -5/10\nits a port -50/10\n\n","October 17, 2015","false","9.4"," 107 of 157 people (68%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","68","107","157","8","0"

So they are so not relevant. This game is on a totally different platform and any other game shouldn't be compared in order to give a truly relevant review. If you're going to review a game review the game, not the other game you played and now come and say this game sucks.\n\nMY REVIEW:\n\nI enjoy this game very much, it's a great turn based tactical strategy game with an element of random gear being bought or attained the more you play, as well as new marines. This is the first Squad based stategy game I've really enjoyed playing in a real long time. The missions are short and can be done in 10 to 15 min, so if you need a quick game and go you can do that, and the game is auto saved and loads when you start up. Which some may not like but for me who plays during work between calls it's amazing.\n\nThe fact I don't know what I'm getting as far as gear goes makes it a little more interesting and a challenge and I enjoy that fact. It's a fun and enjoyable game. If you like Turn Based Squad level action games I'd highly recommend it. I've gotten enjoyment enough that I've written a review and to be honest I've never even written one, but with so many negative reviews because of some other game someone else made I figured it should get a good one from me. After all we all don't play every single game we come across, on every single gaming system made by man. I know I don't. so play the game with an open mind and open heart and enjoy it for what it is.

Too many people are having one of several gamebreaking bugs, which may have something to do with a memory leak in the coding. It is crashing in multiple different ways for dozens of people, check the forum. These issues should have been removed in Beta testing.\n\nIt has been a week since I emailed Rodeo Games on this issue (Giving them my dxdiag), and while they were polite I have received no help or communication since then. They did not suggest any fixes or what the problem might be. They are aware of the bug and are not responding to it properly. I am no 'Rocket Surgeon' but I am capable with computers and know my way around a file system, so it is really disappointing to have no presence on this as I am confident any information would help.\n\nSome people have found changing security settings to work, but this is only for one iteration of the bug. Others say it is an issue with the Unreal engine, and that may be plausible.The main bug most people experience stalls you at the Logo bar and initiates a linear increase memory leak until it crashes or your computer freezes. This is called the 'black box' bug because that is what you will end up staring at until you restart your computer.\n\nI have seen people running it on youtube, but that is the developer release and I am not sure it has the same coding. I want to like this game. I want to play it, even despite the issues with overly simplistic gameplay mechanics. I can't recommend it though.\n\nNot when:\n\nA) there are so many people who can't play the game, even with fitting specs\nB) It is a higher price than the version it is ported from\nC) It hasn't been optimized from that port.\nD) It is buggy even besides this.\nE) The in game economy is broken because they were too lazy to rewrite the Pay to play market code.\n\nIf you ABSOLUTELY have to own EVERY 40k game, and you experience no gamebreaking bugs, this is still not a $30 game. Wait for a HEAVY discount on a steam sale and wait for them to patch the code.\n\nLook at all the reviews and the one word you will see the most is LAZY. Everything about this game from what I can see is half-asked and lazily done. They didn't polish this game and I wonder if they even stress tested the game between releasing it as a FTP and as a PC port.\n\nUnacceptable behavior that is becoming too common in the games industry.

The most obviously stated error with this port is looting. Ok so it would have been hard to re-structure than entire loot system without making a whole new game, but couldn't it have been tweaked just a bit to have some coherency? That aside once you accept the fact that you'll get more time with your space marine buddies than you anticipated on some of the same levels more than you thought you would, it becomes ok. The games strongpoint in my opinion is the number of chapter specific weapons and characters.

To make a long story short, you're the field command of a tactical squad of the Deathwatch, a coallition of other Space Marine chapters opted in to work with the Ordo Xenos of the Inquisition. In this situation, a sector known as Astolat is under the threat of the Tyranids, essentially space locusts that eat planets bare of any bio-organic life that fuels the creation of even more Tyranids, that are slowly chugging towards the center of the galaxy. Your job: Ensure the Hive Fleet is mired here, and if possible, keep it from passing through the sector. Again, simplistic but servicable for 40k and doesn't pull a 'LOL CHAOS WAS BEHIND IT ALL ALONG!' stick.\n\nGAMEPLAY - 3.5/5\n\nThe gameplay is still heavily based off it's IOS roots, with controls almost all capable with just Left Mouse, though some things have been tagged with hotkeys, making a chain of Overwatch setups that much more easier. Each soldier has access to 4 AP (by default) per turn, allowing them to move, shoot, or do other actions with those AP over that turn. As far as my experience with the game goes, Your marines are split into four combat classes (Assault, Devastator, Tactical, and Apothacary) who each have preferred weapons and get special skills depending on the Chapter the marine belonged to, with each portrait type denoting what capabilities and abilities that specific marine may have. Everything in the game has a 1-4 Tier rank as well, so the higher the tier, the more special abilities or stronger the thing is defaultly. The tyranid units, while more numerous in the map, tend to act like cannon fodder to a squad of well-trained marines, though in later levels you will meet tougher enemies, up to and including massive 3x3 tiled monstrosities that require heavy weapons and well-trained marines to take down, and managing where the marines are and where they're going.\n\nPROGRESSION - 2/5\n\nEasily the most annoying part of the game, and sadly where the port nature comes to bear the most. In order to get more wargear (and marines) you must complete missions, which will grant a random wargear item, and 20-40 Requisition Points (varies by difficulty options, but you can't do difficulty options until you finish the game's 40 or so levels once). These requisition points are used to purchase booster packs, an obvious replacement for a previous F2P cash shop mechanic from the IOS version. This also means that by the time you run into your first major hurdle (like, say, the first Carnifex fight), you may not have the right equipment to face off against it, and thus be forced to grind until the RNG gods bless you with a godly marine/weapon combo for taking down large beasts. The marine's progressions is a bit more tolerable- each marine can gain exp during missions, with most exp to an individual coming from landing killing blows (and each kill giving a small sum to every survivor as well). This banked EXP can then be used to unlock abilities, traits, and level the marine's health/accuracy/crit rate, as far as I can tell the stat buffs are unlimited, with a constantly-increasing buffer of EXP to reach per level. If a marine dies in action, you'll lose that banked EXP however, which makes really grinding a high-leveled marine's exp a bit hard if you're not just tricking a endless-spawn mission for EXP grind (Burning Bridges comes to mind...)\n\nIMMERSION - 9/5\n\nWhy yes, I broke my scoring system for this gag, what of it. The setting and presentation of the game is easily the BEST of any 40k game released in the last 5 years, Dawn of Wars included. Viewing the world of the 41st Millenium in a tactical level is why I pine for a Dark Heresy game built like Shadowrun, and while our Deathwatch marines don't actively meet any friendlies in the adventure (as far as I'm aware), the world looks absolutely gorgeous, thanks to the use of the Unreal engine. Even the lowliest of Ultramarine Tacticals have unique visual differences over other chapters that help to show off the units, and the splendor only grows as you get higher-tier units adn the eye candy shows more. The unique chapters for the Enhanced Edition in particular are especially visually delightful, of particular note the Dark Angel Veteran, and the other unique units of the chapters ain't too far off. Another thing, something that not much of the promotional work seems to touch on, is the bantar that goes between your squadmates. Blood Angel, Space Wolf, and Ultramarine squad members will talk between each other, from jabs about chapter stereotypes to musings on if the Emperor would be unhappy about the Ecclisiarchy, to questioning if they are indeed fighting a losing battle for the planets of the sector. The only reason this wasn't marked a 10 was because the Enhanced Edition chapters weren't included in the banter.\n\nTL;DR\nIt's rough around the edges, and if you are allergic to grinding you'll drive yourself nuts here, but otherwise the averageness of the gameplay tends to get overshadowed by the close-up look of Tyranid Hiveships, torn-apart cities, and corroding Imperial bunkers, and your squadmates talking casually as they mow through hordes upon hordes of the Tyranid menace. If you're looking for a turn-based tactics game where your soldiers aren't made of tissue paper, you can't really go wrong with Deathwatch.","October 31, 2015","true","47.5"," 22 of 30 people (73%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","73","22","30","5","0"

So where do these negative ♥♥♥♥♥y gamers come from?  I have no idea.  I looked up some of my most favorite games and the first 10 reviews or so are all negative thumbs down from gamers who like the game and have 100 hours + in.  What the heck is that?\n\nSo now onto Warhammer Deathwatch.  The first set of negative reviews are from gamers who liked the game so much they bought both the tablet/mobile versions and the PC versions.  I have never heard of anyone buying 2 versions of the same game.  You're upset that the newer version didn't have the content you expected?  Really?  Any smart buyer would tell you to wait to see the content it had. Is it the be all and end all of all WH40K squad turn based games?  Maybe not but is it awesome and enjoyable?  Absolutely.  At first it seems like a very simple format with not much too it, but as the levels increase, your quest for cards becomes an addiction, and detailing your squad out with champions, heroes and new gear makes it a lovable format.   And what other squad turn based game set in WH40K are you going to play?  Get off it!\n\nSome gripe its a cash grab?  Are you kidding me?  WH40K squad turn-based????  That is a niche of all gamers.  There's not many of us to cash grab from.  Not to mention the detail that went into this game is a labor of love.\nSimply put its a good game that is very enjoyable.  What I like about it?  Very easy to learn and go through the missions.  So much so that when you beat the campaign it ups the difficulty, and I played through both upped difficulties.  Let's you play with many cool chapters and heroes.  Many customization options with a huge variety of weapons and leveling up options.  At the end of the day its addictive and fun.  Its not perfect but it is great value.\n\nWorthy thoughts for improvement are:\n-AI is dull, comes straight at you after spawning which is ultimately fine but sometimes it moves melee guys infront of shooters who then cant shoot.\n-The card system is random meaning you could put a 100hrs in and never get the card (marine/gun/misc option) that you're looking for... totally agree with another reviewer requisition points should be used to unlock cards or a tech tree to work towards what card you want.  Though at the same point it does make it addictive to play through the campaign again at higher difficulties...\n-the campaign is quite easy and short, maybe a 3 - 4 missions are tough.  On the next level of difficulty it gets a bit more challenging and on the last difficulty setting every mission becomes incredibly tactical where any miss step could mean the entire loss of your squad.  The quickness makes replay value very enjoyable as you give it a go with different squads\n-if you're guy dies you only lose XP not a permanent death\n-there should be different movement between regular squad members to assault marines to the devastator marines, they all have the same movement points and cover the same amount of squares.  Assault marines should have jump capabilities or cover more ground with their movement points.\n-Devastator marines are weirdly balanced.  They have the heaviest guns which are great against big targets but require 2ap to fire when confronted with more targets they can easily get overwhelmed.  Does it make sense my devastator with his heavy bolter facing 4 small targets can only take out 2 if he hits?  Shouldn't he be able to take out all if they're in the line of fire?\n-no real mission preview; would be nice to able to customize your team for the type of mission (you're only given a vague idea of the mission) and you cannot restart as quitting the mission ends in a defeat whereby you lose all XP for all characters\n-you cannot reset the game to start again\n\nAll in all this is a fine turn based game for the price, nothing special but Iove it.  It has a lot of potential and if they start generating alot of DLCs then this can be one heck of a game.  We will have to see what comes of it.  Highly recommended if you're looking for a squad turn based game.","March 3","true","154.3"," 19 of 25 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","19","25","2","0"

It is missing alot of normal options you would expect on a PC game. One thing that just bugs the hell out of me is not being able to start a new game. Sure you can replay the same levels again and again grinding gear and exp  or play the game on harder settings but start again from fresh nope. Sometimes people like the option just to start again.\nThe next major flaw in my opinion is the randomized rewards. It is so time consuming the amount of grinding you need to do plus the amount of luck you need to get the team of marines you want. Let alone getting them equiped with the weapons and gear you want. The system carries the hallmarks of its origin having been set up to encourage people to spend real money to get more random rewards cards than normal. The option to make purchases with real money has thankfully been removed but the random rewards remains. After 50 hours i still do not have a team or weapons close to what i want. I have replayed the same levels many times to get points for unlock cards only to get the same marine, weapon or piece of gear you dont want over and over. You end up hating the game instead of enjoying it.\nThese are just two things that majorly took away from the experience for me.

This is Gamer Guy (In a Suit) from the Echo Army YouTube channel! Today I am bringing you a review of the latest entry in the Warhammer series of PC games, Warhammer 40,000 Deathwatch: Enhanced Edition!\n\n(NOTE: This game was reviewed using a key provided by the Developer)\n\nVideo Review:\n\nWarhammer 40K Deathwatch: Enhanced Edition Review\n\n\nThe "Too Long, Didn't Watch" Review:\n\nA very weak entry in the typically outstanding Warhammer franchise. A mobile port, and it shows. 2 out of 5. Pick up at\n80% off during a Steam sale ONLY if you like Turn-Based strategy type or are a BIG Warhammer fan. Otherwise, pass. You won't miss a thing.\n\nThe "Meat & Potatoes" Review:\n\nUgh. Where do we begin. Okay, perhaps I am being harsh but I don't think I am alone here. There are certain expectations one has in a franchise. Warhammer 40,000 PC games are usually pretty damn good, especially if you are a fan of the franchise. This game, however, is a MAJOR disappointment. Let me explain why because it really boils down to two words for most: Enhanced Edition. This is nothing more than a mobile port. Period. The graphics, while they do seem to be sucking up some memory and making my fans run full blast, are shockingly lackluster. They would be great for a tablet, but simply not what you would expect from a PC game claiming to have amazing graphics. The gameplay is nothing new. It is standard Turn-Based action. Pick your squad from your pool of Space Marines, execute the mission. Again,uninspired and really just feels like a lot of endless clicking. This is mostly due to an overall lack of immersion in the game whatsoever. I frankly felt bored playing. The only fun in this one I had was with the leveling and "Card" system. After each Victory, you can level up your Space Marines (nothing new to see here) and you get card drops that appear to mostly be weapons you can equip and use. Sometimes you get Packs of Cards, giving you three cards which appear to be more than just weapons as I managed to obtain an item (Frag grenades), an ability to use in combat and an extra Marine for my pool of Marines. If I am feeling like playing something Warhmmer, I will fire up anything in the Dawn of War or Space Marines catalogs instead or if I want some Turn-Based strategizing and action, I'll lean towards Breach & Clear or Door Kickers.\n\nUnfortunately, this blend of 2 normally good things falls well short of being a solid PC title, let alone one worthy of being an "Enhanced Edition". It's merely a 2 out of 5. Not even close to being a $25 game. It's a $4.99 game tops....steer clear unless you're a diehard Warhammer fan or the price comes WAY down.\n\nHappy Gaming!!!","October 26, 2015","false","1.4"," 17 of 27 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","17","27","2","0"

Visuals are improved with lightning effects that add a lot of atmosphere, the UI is much easier to manage with keyboard and mouse and installed on an SSD the loading times are more or less non-existant.\n\nThe game has also been entirely rebalanced for the PC release. In-app purchases of loot cards are gone and the requisition points you earn during missions to purchase the cards with have been greatly increased, so that you on average get the funds to buy a new card (with a new marine and two items) after every fifve missions, in addition to the free loot card you get for finishing every four-mission chapter of the campaign. Experince gain from the missions has also been doubled compared to the iOS version which makes for a much faster progression with little grinding required.\n\nMy only disappointment so far with the PC version is the extra content. Although advertised as three more Space Marine chapters the new chapters are not complete, and consists only of one each of assault/tactical/devastator marines and one veteran. By comparison the original three chapters had approx. 18 different marines each, including champion and hero tier marines that are entirely missing from the new chapters.\n\nMy take on this is that if you have played the iOS version to death and finished the campaigns there is little new content here to make it worthwhile to play the game all over again. But the improved visuals and UI combined with no micro transactions makes it a good choice if you haven't tried the game before or if you have just started out on the iOS version.","October 16, 2015","true","14.1"," 16 of 26 people (62%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","62","16","26","2","0"

However, I strongly suggest you NOT purchase it for the full price of $24.99. I bought it on sale for $12.49, and honestly I love this game. It's not the best looking 40K game, it's not the best playing 40K game, but the developers poured their love for the franchise into making this game and it shows!\n\nThe combat is turn-based, similar to XCOM but different. The camera control is my only complaint, but it's a minor one at best once you get used to it. The best part about the game is collecting new Space Marines and gear. There's also random conversations between your Space Marines that show the developer's knowledge of the 40K lore and backstory.\n\nGreat game, I cannot recommend it enough to anyone that loves the 40K universe. It might not be the best game out there, but it's enjoyable and (in my honest opinion) much better than the slew of 40K cash-ins that have been springing up as of late.","January 6","true","14.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Honestly this game is very good and well worth the money...if you have a video card it likes. I contacted support and they were on-the-spot ready to issue a refund, but I chose not to go that route and I'm really glad I didn't refund it since I shortly thereafter discovered the aforementioned fix.\n\nI really debated changing this to recommended but the forthcoming nature of their support won me over. BUYER BEWARE. If it doesn't like your video card (and they have no supported list anywhere I've seen) - try adding the launcher option I mentioned, or ask (nicely!) for a refund.\n\nUp against Space Hulk Ascension, I prefer this game by a landslide if for no other reason than the number of attacks are out in the open and it's not such a guessing game judging an outcome. This game is no less difficult on harder difficulties, but combat is much more consistent: the lowliest tyranid doesn't gruesomely kill you from full hp when you miss one attack.\n\nAltogether I have no issues with this game now and am thoroughly enjoying it. Even if it does crash on you at some point, the game is very good about resuming from the same turn so little-to-no progress is lost.","February 18","true","73.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

The core game is actually nice.\nOtherwise stay away. Too expensive and riddled with bugs.\n\nPorting a mobile game to PC is a recipe for disaster. And this is no exception. It's a shoddy port that wasn't translated properly for a PC environment and on top of that it has a pretty long list of bugs. Several of which crash the game. And then there's the price...\n\nThe game also takes FOREVER to actually becoming enjoyable, it took me like 6-7 hours too finally feel like I wasn't still playing a prologue during which you only encounter cannon fodder. So unless you're a huge 40k fan and like turn-based games, you will most likely stop playing long before it becomes enjoyable.\n\nThat said however, despite all the bugs and missing achievements, the game starts becoming more and more fun towards the end. And when you start the second difficulty level, things really start to ramp up. Not only are the basic mobs now a threat (they have like 4 times as much HP now), but I'm also pretty sure there are more of them. Grinding for exp and boosters suddenly becomes more viable. Not to mention that you actually have to use all those skills and wargear.\n\nThe rpg aspect is mostly well balanced and done well too, albeit slow (but the higher difficulty the less of an issue this is).The banter between the various chapters is nice and the high tier marines look pretty sweet. Alhough it's still perfectly possible to pwn with a standard tier 1 tac marine assuming you get some nice wargear and some decent skills.\nMy only gripe with the rpg side is that it's hugely benefical to have your entire squad belong to one chapter, but then you miss out on the banter.\n\nSo to recap: after about 15 hours (about what it took me to beat the campaign) the game becomes genuinely fun despite all its issues. I would LOVE to see this redone as a proper PC game. But make no mistake, half the stuff in the game either doesn't work or causes crashes. And there hasn't been a single patch yet as far as I can tell. Although I have no problem WHATSOEVER with the camera controls like some people here claim.\nThe game costs WAY too much for what you get, but if you have a 40k itch that needs scratching you'll pay it anyway.","October 22, 2015","true","70.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

But other than that I am happy with my purchase, I got well over 10 hours of gameplay out of the game on normal mode and will easily double/triple that if I play through on the medium and hard difficulties.\n\nIf you are a fan of X-Com and the 90's style tactical turn based RPGs you'll definitely like this game. It is very simple (wish there was more to the character development) but the simplicity does not take away from the gameplay.\n\nI personally didn't pay much attention to the story, Grim darkness, war, death, destruction, TYRANIDS! EXTERMINATE! Blah Blah the same standard 40k stuff but the gameplay was something I could do every evening to unwind and relax.\n\nFinally, the only other issue that I had with this game was the death of a Space Marine. I assumed when they died, they were dead but they simply lose XP. This feature, I feel, makes the game a little 'too' easy and takes away from the Deathwatch lore (where marine fatalities are high) and doesn't encourage you to level up/use your reserve marines very much.\n\nAll in all, if you are on the fence, give it a shot.

More if they fix the alarmingly common conflict with firewall and start up issues (if you are going to buy, read the full review) .\n\nWHEN SHOULD YOU BUY? (even if you like it still): Maybe if it's on sale for 35% off or more, and if you're ready to address the issues getting it to play, and if you can't get the app store version (or just must have the Dark Angels or Black Templars)\n\nIn more detail...\n\nI wanted to give this game a positive rating so deeply, I did. On the original portable version I absolutely would, however the PC version... it does more harm then good. What it adds, and yeah it is some neat stuff, doesn't replace the functional and game play issues created.\n\nFirst off, and for many the most important note in this review, to get it playing many people (many, I keep using that word for a reason, check the forums here) have to flag it passed their firewall during install or after... and THEN still tell Steam to make sure to open it only in windowed mode. A game less than 4 years old that takes forum searching for TWO notable problems to get working, and then a few people still say they have issue, I like this companies games (they're fun at their core, that's a big plus!) but, that's tough to overlook. Yes I got it working but that sucks not everyone can.\n\nSecond, and this is more opinion, this game really benefitted from microtransactions. A small amount of them (<10$) were kind of core to convenient game play. They took those away in PC version, and while they added some stuff which true was kinda cool and bonus points for that, now the problem is it's ALREADY a 'grindy' game and having to wait longer for things you want (and occasionally need) made it grindier.\nParticularly when you add in that you have to level your team it becomes problematic, grind on grind on grind problematic. When enough tier 3-4 marine cards don't drop you end up playing with guys you'll level only to have to remove and relevel later when better teammates drop. 3x grind is not a good transition.\n\nOn the portable version you could spend say 8$, and if you can't spend 8$ more on something you enjoy go back to the kiddie table because that's less than 1 drink at a decent bar with friends, and you'd be almost guaranteed that, along with the cards you earn through playing, by Act 2-4 you'd have a team that could really be your 'final' team if you so desired and the problem is solved... you could just PLAY.\nIn the current PC version? Bad luck can leave you at Act 7 (or more) knowing you're going to have to go back and level new guys still.\n\nThat's grind multiplied by grind multiplied by grind if the Golden Throne doesn't shine on your luck.\n\nIn short, without microtransactions, this game really needed a way to just spend points, even a lot of points, to directly buy higher level (at least Tier 3) cards. It did NOT have this and, by all accounts, will not be patched to have it.\n\nTo be clear, the PC enhanced edition isn't a crap product from a crap company... it's a slightly subpar adaptation of a good product from a good developer. The portable version is a 7.5-8 (or more) of 10, credit where that's due, and the PC version with a few fixes might one day be that.

It has a faster pace, more enemy variety, more weapon varieties, and a cool little leveling system. I think that some of the abilitys should cost less experience points to buy, but it does make an interesting choice of "do I level up now, or do I save up my exp points to buy an ability?" Still, it hasn't broken the game for me yet.\n\nthe game does have some bugs in it currently, but I think they will be patched out later on.

It is what I was imaging when I was playing XCOM Enemy Unknown, now I don't have to. Leading a team of Space Marines on deadly missions through dark passages. Aliens trying to rip you apart around every corner. The tactics that come into play in a turn based game like this are great, you can actually respond as though you were a group of 5 highly trained warrior monks in powered armor. You have so much freedom to compose your squad however you want, changing their equipment and upgrading their skills as they gain XP.\n\nThe Space Marines keep their helmets on during the game, it adds a lot to immersion for me and it's a nice change from other 40K games where they think showing their faces is the only way to show character. Each space Marine has his owner personality and voice actor, and they are even accurate with background lore in their conversations as they cover each others backs purging xeno scum from the galaxy.","October 18, 2015","true","293.9"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

Sound is also of a decent quality, though I have to mention the weapon sounds in particular, they are very good.  I would go as far as to say this is the first WH40k game that makes me really appreciate what a Bolter should sound like and I like the impact sounds, very satisfying\nEdit: As well as some spoken mission briefings, when you are in the mission marines do talk to each other, this ranges from banter/playful insults between marines from different chapters to more story focused chatter as why you have been sent on the mission and what your marines think the inquisitions overall plan is.  I like how near the end of these dialogues a marine will tell the others to be quiet, reminded me a bit of "Aliens" how the marines would talk to each other.  Very atmosphric when this happens on a hive ship\nGameplay is turn based, farily streamlined in execution and fans of Warhammer Quest will feel right at home\nYou get to build your squad and outfit them with some truly devasting weapons, so far I have 2 assault marines, a devastator and some tacticals.  I feel that they have got the classes right\nCons:\nNot much in the way of voice acting when it comes to killing things.  I know this may have been due to budget or dev time or whatever but in the WH40k world of games, hearing your marines spout off fanatical insults and cheers after killing something is a given and gives the marines character\nNo multiplayer\nNo cover bonuses against ranged attacks\nThe above pros and cons list could change as I play more.  For now I can recommend this to WH40k fans for sure, I get more enjoyment out of this than I do the vanilla Space Hulk game on PC.  Deathwatch has more atmosphere going for it and customisability for your marines.  I hope in time we get some additional campaigns.\n\nFor just fans of the turn based genre there are other, better options out there but I say this due to its price, if it was maybe 50% off, even if you are not a fan of WH40k, give it a go.","October 19, 2015","true","7.7"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

I'm reviewing this game by itself as a PC game.\n\nMost new PC quality games come out at the $50+ range for PC. That being said, for $25, my expectations are initially set at half of what I expect from full-priced and developed PC games. With that in mind, this game does not disappoint.\n\nAre there bugs? Yes. Glitches? Yes. Does the weird sound bug of the squad-prep screen drive me nuts? Absolutely.\n\nHowever, I'm on my second play-through of this game now, and I've had a lot of fun with it.\n\nWhen I'm looking at a turn-based strategy game like this, I look for several qualities: customization, replayability, and challenge level.\n\nCustomization (8/10): Okay, this game's got this part down in spades. You've got four basic classes of units: Tacticals, Assaults, Apothecaries, and Devastators (Aka, all-arounder, close-combat expert, healer, and long-range dude). Each of those guys can come from one of six different chapters, each of which gives their own spin on that class. More than that, you can get different tiers of quality, from tier 1 to tier 4, of that class, and each tier has more abilities and traits than the one before, giving you even more potential options for how to play. Combine this with a wide array of weaponry and wargear, and it scores pretty solid for me here.\n\nReplayability (7/10): In our campaign, we have 9 Acts, each comprised of four missions. Each mission can run you anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour, depending on how difficult or complex that mission is. 36 missions, half an hour each on average. You're looking at a good 18 hours of gameplay, give or take, to finish the campaign. That's if you don't go back and re-do some missions to train your guys and farm some EXP like I did. The second playthrough, things bump up in difficulty. Things are more dangerous, harder to kill, but you're more experienced, and your guys have a plethora of abilities to call upon. This second playthrough, which I'm on now, really makes me feel like I'm playing the full experience now of kick-♥♥♥ Deathwatch Astartes. The first was fun, don't get me wrong, but I was experimenting and figuring things out then. Halfway through the second playthrough, and I'm still having fun, even though I've done these missions before. And there's still a whole third difficulty level to play on when I beat this one!\n\nChallenge (9/10): Not too hard, not too easy. Just right. When you think you've got it down, they'll throw you a curve-ball. Nothing prepares you for that first Carnifex, or having to play peek-a-boo with Hive Guard who can knock off 2/3 of your marine's health in one shot if you give him the chance. Some of the mission are a bit repetitive and straight-forward, but they through you these curves just often enough that you're always peeking around every corner, wary of what surprise the next room might have. Your learning curve is steep at times. However, if you're a veteran of turn-based strategy games, you'll pick up on the tips and tricks easily. This isn't a super-hard game. It's just challenging enough to be stimulating, while being able to relax and enjoy it.\n\nAnother thing I like? I'm a collector and looter. I love finding all this loot, gathering all these Marines. For people like me, constantly looking to get bigger and better stuff, it'll be a long while through the game before you start even getting your team to a point where you think, "Yeah, we're good, no more replacements needed." I still haven't gotten to that point yet.\n\nSummary: It's not the greatest game around, but for $25, I think it's well worth it. If you're reading this and the game is on sale for $15 or $20, pick it up; you won't be disappointed.","October 26, 2015","true","40.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The gameplay is fairly simple and is right in line with Rodeo's previous game Warhammer Quest. You can level up your Space Marines and find better gear.

The gear aquisition is heavily based on luck of the draw. I think that the price point is too high for what you get here (USD 10 would be better for me) but that the game is good and addictive.\n\nWhether to get the PC version or the IOS version would depend on whether or not you want a lower price point with in-app purchases or a higher price point on the PC without I think.","October 16, 2015","true","6.8"," 11 of 29 people (38%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","38","11","29","3","0"

You play through missions in a variety of locations and improve and customize your marines with new gear and abilities as they level up.  There is a wide variety of weapons and units from different chapters to mix and match to best suit your current objectives.  You open card packs to gain random new gear and units.\n\nThe story is okay and seems more like a loose framework for the battles rather than an in-depth narrative in the space marine universe.  There is a low variety of enemies, through the middle of the second act I have only encountered four-five types of enemies.  The strategy is not very deep but it still is enjoyable to play.\n\nI would recommend this game to people who enjoy a light strategy experience over relatively short mission lengths with a single objective.  It is a good iOS port.\n\n","October 16, 2015","true","4.3"," 9 of 34 people (26%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","26","9","34","0","0"

Xcom meets Deathwatch! Love the concept!!\n\nHowever I would hold off buying the game as it still has many bugs. It freezers at random and you are required to restart the game to fix this.\n\nAlso there are errors with objectives. Some levels when you complete the final objective it come up with DEFEAT! This gets really annoying when you have 28k experince on each member of the team and you loose it all when you 'complete your objective'.\nAlso I am not a fan of the of the random reward system that they have with their decks. I am part way through verteran and I have recived zero Black Templar and one Imperial Fist. I would find it more appealing if I could level basic marines up to Champions or even provide a store where I could obtain the marines and desired kit with the ingame money, thus removing that random factor.\n\nOverall I do enjoy the banter of the marines through the missions plus I love the fact that it's simple.","October 28, 2015","false","46.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I mean, I like strategy games, I like Warhammer 40k a lot and I like what I know from the Deathwatch Chapter of Space Marines. But I didn't know what to expect of the game, for until now I didn't play a lot of that kind of turn-based tactical game.\n\nBut I really enjoy it! The beginning is very simple, but it becomes a little more challanging over time. I enjoy that bit of luck, that you don't fully no what kind of units or equipment you'll be getting next, and that's what makes it so loveable for me. I so much love when games actually make me adabt to the circumstances. And it's sweet you can sell some equipment to get a new pack of three new possibilities (though I was first confused by that).\n\n\nSomething totally different:\n"There was a Japan AI,\nwhich circuits were made not to fry.\nIt got caught in a loop.\nIt got caught in a loop.\nIt got caught in a loop."\n\nWhile I had encountered a little bug concerning the enemy AI in a mission, I scanned through the reviews and was rathere surprised by the deep red of the first page of them. But finally I understood that this system with the packages was about the iOS version where you could spend real money to take away the coincidence and stuff.\n\nSome reviews were rather contradictional, both had played the 'original', but the one said "it's too easy on PC" and the other "it's too grindy without the shop". Well, I can only assume that it felt easy when you restart the game, because if I'd play the first mission again now I'd be bored too.\n\nAnd some mentioned that there were other games of the kind, most of all Xcom. And lucky I was that day, it's been on sale! :D :D :D So I bought it too, looking forward for it was said that it was more challanging.\n\nI am not going to review Xcom now but let's say this: There's a whole browser-game of extra stuff about it, but the actual tactical fighting ain't that much different. And though some things are a little different, it is not that much more difficult. I'll admit it has a few more components to the fighting, but not too many and they don't play too great a relevance in most missions. So I frown a little at those reviews which compare these games with one another.\n\nAnd on of the most important points that speak for Deathwatch is that it is a far more charming atmosphere if you love the apocalyptic univers of 40k. And the Marines actually get to know each other in a hidden mechanic! And they have so many hidden jokes and in-lore references, it's awesome! <3\n\n\nAnd last, the price. You see, let's be a bit generally fair, all games got a bit more expansive than they deserve, and at the same time there are those game designers and programmers that need money to pay their rent. And what fun would summer / winter sale be without big numbers getting maximally minimized? :D I mean, when I feel the urge to buy something NOW than those 20 bugs might slip my pocket, but usually I've got enough other games to wait for the sales. With that little bit in mind, the price is not really a concern of any game. Just a lame excuse to buff up the red review - just my opinion, no offence.\n\nAnd I see that those who bought the original already, bought all the in-app items and than- wow, wait, WHAT?!\nYou've already got the game, you've already paid tons of money for things you couldn't wait for within the game, and THEN you couldn't wait to buy the (pretty much) same game AGAIN and THEN got the nerve to complain about the price?\nARE YOU NUTS?!","November 16, 2015","true","14.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gameplay is actually pretty fun, and while pretty grindy, missions are decently quick and the upgrades to your units through skills/weapons do make them feel more powerful, like an upgrade should! So why can i no longer recommend this to people? Bugs, bugs, and more bugs. Some worse then others, for example - a whole handful of achievements simply do not work. They cannot be unlocked. Another example, some marines have had certain abilities removed, never to be replaced. effectively making an "upgraded rank space marine" no real upgrade at all. Now your mileage may very depending on how much you care about things like that, as they dont ruin the actual gameplay experience really. But some of the bugs are literally game breaking, like, no longer able to play the actual game you bought, bugs. And while that bug doesnt effect everyone, there are way more people then there should be that have run into it and simply cannot play a game they purchased.\n\nThe final nail in the coffin of WH40K: Deathwatch? The Devs have publicly abandoned this game. Thats right folks, these bugs are never getting fixed. No new content to be added (new chapters, upgrading the existing extra chapters to have the same rank 4 marines as the initial chapters do, nothing). This game is dead and gone, left to float in the warp for all eternity.\n\nThis could have been an AMAZING game! Unfortunately, it now has to come with a "Does Not Recommend" and a warning label - purchase at your own risk.","January 4","false","34.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
