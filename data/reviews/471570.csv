The puzzles themselves are fun to solve and even though it could take more than one try or even quite a few, the calm music would most likely stop you from raging.\n\nIt's a great game to play when you just want to relax, enjoy puzzles and feel peaceful with the remnants of your grandfather.","May 24","true","8.7"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

You slide around like colored squares on a board and have them match up. This version has a lot of similar ideas to others I've played in the past, and it has a couple of new ideas, which is good.  What I like most about this variant is that the number of moves you make doesn't matter. This is always a source of frustration for me whenever I play these games when they demand you solve the puzzle in the fewest amount of moves to get 3 stars.\n\nWhere this game excels is in its polish. The graphics are crisp and the game feels great. However, what I like best is the beautiful piano tracks playing in the background. It makes for a very relaxing experience while working your brain.\n\nOverall, very highly recommended if you like these types of puzzle games.","May 25","true","23.6"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

The music is calming but after half an hour the music becomes repetetive and thus annoying so I switched it of and listened to an accoustic calming playlist on Spotify, that worked quite well I'd say :)\n\nGraphically it's nice, the motions are fluid and gives you a couple of hours to kill. Overall I'm happy with this game. There's no actual story line, just click and play.\n\n7,5/10","May 25","true","3.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Reminds me a lot of the "Quell" series although they have different styles, but if you enjoyed that then I don't see why you couldn't enjoy this.","May 27","true","12.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

With its very rich atmosphere, skillfully designed puzzles and timely introduced gameplay elements, Grandpa's Table is definitely one of the puzzle games that I enjoy playing for a while and going back to when I feel like.\n\nThe very atmospheric main menu says long on the overall quality of the game and perfectionism of its (charming, judging by the credits) two developers. Drinking some in-game coffee while playing with light effects on a georgeous 3D wooden table is just a blast - even better when also drinking real-life coffee and listening to Grandpa's Table's awesome music.\n\nGameplay wise, it's just great. There is some good difficulty for people who are got at puzzles, but it's not overly hard and people who don't want too great a challenge can also easily skip some puzzles, or solve them without grabbing all stars if they're not OCD'ed like I am. New gameplay are added little by little as you play, which makes every set of level quite interesting, and makes you want to go forward through this huge level set (5 level sets with - presumably, I haven't unlocked them all yet - 30 levels each). There's enough to play with for a few months depending on your pace, and for this price and overall quality, it's a must have.","June 4","true","6.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Man does that bring back memories.  I remember my grandpa's favorite game was about how his little friend under the table had accidentally eaten poison and I had to squeeze his neck until he threw up.  We played that so many times, and as many lives I saved I should get some sort of medal.\n\nThat's not a lot like this Grandpa's Table though.  My time with this game has not involved any elderly genitalia, or even washing everything up ‚Äúso the bad guys can't find out‚Äù.  I've seen this game compared to Quell, and that seems accurate.  You slide colored bits around until they line up in specific ways, thereby winning the game.  The puzzles get more and more devious, until you think they were designed by the Bilderberg Group.\n\nSuffice it to say, Grandpa's Table has many secrets, and you won't even have to spend years in therapy to reveal them.  Two thumbs up.","May 29","true","5.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","50","2","4","3","0"
