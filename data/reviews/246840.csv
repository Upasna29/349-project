The graphics are simple, but cute and colorful. The music's cheerful. And the gameplay is a simple concept that really keeps you engaged. In my case, this definitely isn't nostalgia speaking, and I'm not looking at it through the rose-colored lenses of my childhood. I never played it, or any others in the series, until recently. And it's kind of impressive just how well this game has held up over time.\n\nThe game's premise, borrowed liberally from the original Diablo, is a basic dungeon-crawler RPG. Each level of the dungeon is randomly generated and filled with items and monsters. Villagers in town will give you quests tied to specific levels, and you journey in and out of the dungeon as you complete your tasks. You can only take three quests at a time, and it's up to you whether you take the maximum on every level and explore every corridor, or rush through on your way to the final boss.\n\nAs you complete quests and hack and slash your way through the dungeon's monsters, you gain experience, and leveling up allows you to increase your skills and stats in specific areas.  Looting dungeons gives you gold and items, and there are also several vendors in town who can sell you items, or perform various services. You can also earn money (and find rare items) by catching fish in the fishing holes found throughout the game.\n\nGot too much stuff to carry around in the dungeon? No problem. You'll have a pet, an un-killable companion that can also ferry your junk to town in exchange for gold. Your pet can also help fight enemies, but it will flee if its health gets too low and be no use in the fight. If the basic cat or dog isn't powerful enough, you can feed your pet fish in order to transform them into different monsters found in the game. If this sounds an awful lot like Torchlight, it's pretty evident that FATE was a huge influence on that game.\n\nThere is a main story quest that is basically just a harder boss on some random level close to lvl 50. Since the levels are generated randomly, you could just keep playing by continuing down for thousands of levels. Even without the practically unending dungeon, randomly generated levels and a pretty big combination of skills and gear gives FATE almost infinite replayability. This is actually featured in the game well, since finishing the main quest allows you to create a "descendant" character. This new character can keep one "heirloom" item but begin his or her own adventure. It's especially cool that you can also import characters from FATE into the sequels as well, heirlooms and all.\n\nAs an RPG, FATE is not terribly deep. But it is a lot of fun, and it's a great – if somewhat casual – way to blow off steam while crawling through maze-like dungeons and blasting or slashing your way through colorful mobs of creatures.\n\n","May 24, 2015","true","47.7"," 82 of 83 people (99%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","99","82","83","6","11"

A bridge between Diablo and Torchlight. Everything we have in the Torchlight we have because of this smooth project... And Fate itself is based mostly on the Diablo Hellfire best patterns.\n\nIf you're familiar with the Torchlight (and I guess you are), then you'll know everything the Fate got from the first sight.\nCartoon-styled graphics. Mild music, yet reminiscent to Matt Uelmen tracks. Very basic RPG elements but rich grinding system, making you constantly looking for more power-ups and new guns, which will be bigger and brighter... And many-many randomly generated levels (over 2 millions, and that's not a joke). Basically, you can keep playing in the Fate year by year and still be far from its depth (that's what Diablo 3 is only dreaming to be).\n\nComparing FATE to all other "Diablo killers" and especially Diablo 3 itself may not be the best idea, though. While generally all those games, would that be the Diablo itself, Titan quest, Sacred (etc.) - have some story on the plate, you can't say same thing about FATE. It is so random in every point, that even the main quest is not stable, and will be procedurally generated and different for any player. You'll not get any background there but only the very basic: you have a town with some folks, half of them will be traders or item randomizers, while other half will be sending you on some irrelevant quests. And all the quests in the game will be like "reach the level X and kill the monster Z" or "Bring me an item Y from level X".\n\nNow, the main question: should you buy it? Yes.\n\nPoint one: it is good for any dungeon crawler fan. Hardly FATE can take your heart now, with all new titles like Van Helsing or Bastion (or dozens of others), but still it provides a very solid gameplay. A lot of challenge awaits!\nPoint two: even if you are not so deep in dungeon crawlers, but making numbers on Steam (would that be score of games in possession or achievement statistics, or both) - it is a good buy (especially with discount, of course). To make a gold on achievements, you'll probably need less than 5-6 hours.\nFinally, this game has very high valued cards, so you have a good chance to buy the game and even make some money back on top of it!\n\nOverall, it's not a hit or something you can't live without, but it's a very good pick.

Shortly after I got the email from steam telling me what I had just purchased.  I then make my way to my library and look at what I had played vast amounts on my old Windows XP Machine (named inexplicably Winda). I swiftly clicked install on both FATE and its expansion.  I quickly felt a breeze of nostalgia when the game finish installing and loaded up the menu screen.  Almost instantly the rudimentary character creation screen flashed upon the screen and reminded me of all my great characters, which were deleted when Winda died in a horrible HDD failure.  Slowly wiping away a small tear, I chose my pet and my head type.  It took a while to decide which difficulty level to start at.  Eventually, I chose the second hardest, Hero.  Eventually I made my mouse cursor over to the start button and the game loaded in quite well.  After the intro screen which spoke of a horrible monster on level 39.  "So far so good," I thought, "Better than Winda."  Almost instinctively, My pet and I ran over to the dungeon entrance, in which I remembered to speak to the townsfolk for some quests and also to remember to buy a fishing rod eventually.  I finally descended into the dungeon and I was greeted by a familiar voice. After clearing the first floor with my axe, I decided it was time to go shopping.  I had already found a spear and some armor, so the only thing I did was stock up on potions and spell books.  I continued onward for many hours, until I felt like I killed many rats, and skeletons and it was time to expire and start a new game.\n\nThank you for reading,\n\nI'm out.\n","January 24, 2015","true","14.2"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","85","11","13","3","0"

The graphics aren't entirely superb, but you have to remember that it is an older game.\n\nThe quests are very simple minded- yet still you must be the appropriate level to complete them.\n\nI love having the pet. You watch them grow stronger throughout the game, just as you level they do too. Also, allowing to change them into other creatures really spices it up and adds a little variety to combat.\n\nI dislike the click to move aspect of the game because I very easily run into corners in the dungeon. Clicking and holding to attack is something that I have come to enjoy. I do not have to worry about pressing other buttons (unless you play part magician) and I also dont entirely have to aim.\n\nI played this game in my young childhood and never finished.

This 'is' an early entry to the top-down dungeon-crawling RPG genre, so it can be pretty easy to come up with a strategy that makes you near invincible (still takes a bit of time to finish said strategy); the graphics are actually quite nice for 2005, and it supports Anti-Aliasing (probably like 2X MSAA at most, tho).\nI'd highly recommend this if: You're looking for a dungeon-crawler you can pick up and leave without feeling like you didn't make progress.","October 27, 2014","true","18.9"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

The game lets you push right up to the edge of your comfort level and becomes interesting to manage.  Then if you die, Fate will let you respawn in 3 optional ways, which I usually pick the one with the least cost, and wind up several levels down and it's a big struggle to make it back to safety.\n\nThis is a very casual game with infinite replay as all the dungeons are randomly generated.\n\nAlso... FYI - this is an older game.  If you're looking for the latest, look at Torchlight.  I've played both, but being the cheapskate that I am, I figured the gameplay is identical between the two and I wasn't willing pay more than I had to for about the same experience.  YMMV - so choose wisely.\n\nAlso most of my hours are from running a fishing script I wrote (which was a lot of fun to get it working successfully - and made some of the content more accessible for me without playing too much).","February 19, 2015","true","272.8"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

I used to play this game when I was a wee boy... so I guess you could say that I have a lot of Memories and Nolstagia.  However I do not like this game just because of that... this game has a very unqiue Medieval feel to it.  It has a very interesting Inventory UI (Which can be a bother at times but is still very inventive.)  It also has a range of different items and monsters (way to many to count!)  For the most part it seems that dungeon levels are infinte however I havent got very far yet!  This game also has a quest system which is used to gain Fame, Gold, Expierence which can be used to level up your character, and even in some cases Items, .  You also have a faithful compainion which can be a Cat or Dog depending on your preference.  They will aid in your efforts to kill Monsters and also cannot die!  You can also feed your pets fish, which will turn them into something fierce for a time.  You can also transform your pet into something permanelty (I dont know how to do this yet... but I will find out eventually.)  I quite like the idea of transforming your pet for if you are having a tough time and your normal trusty steed aint cuttin it, then you can turn him to a Unicorn or something!  The music is very pleasant and the narrators voice is pretty cool aswell.  The last thing I should mention is that... when you die there are some negative effects.  You will have to choose your fate!  And each choice you choose has a reprocussion like losing XP or Gold.  The one thing that bugs me about this game is that once you clear a Dungeon Level... there aren't any monsters that spawn in afterwards.  (What I mean is that, it would be nice that there would be a minimal amount of monsters that could still spawn so that you could level up over time without having to advance right away without having the recommended skills or power.)  Overall this game is really good, there isn't a lot of flaws with it...  I give it a 9.5 out of 10.","December 20, 2013","true","36.0"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

This game is A classic. Only thing that would make me love this game anymore is if it had multiplayer. The game centers around YOU be you Dicky Gobblkoque or John Doe. And unlike some games, this game only has ONE dungeon. With an infineite amount of levels of which new monsters come and they also increase in levels. These monsters change in variety from a basic slime to yetis. This game, although stable can have bugs every once in a while. One of which i had where my normal cursor stayed on the screen when i started the game. Not allowing me to click any options and FATE took over my computer. Forcing me to cold reboot. But once you are in the actual game, I doubt you will find any glitches. Like i said eariler the monsters level up the deeper into the dungeon you go. So playing on the harder difficulty like I do you can sometimes rush into A level you just can't handle. The spells in this game are extremely varied, sometime even pretty unique. From making monster your friends to attack other enemies, to poisonous clouds that drain the life from your (Not undead) Enemies. There is also a stamina system in the game. Because even heros get tired. This really is only to slow you down. Making it so you can't run forever so thats pretty bad. And one of the best parts... FISHING. Yes, the developers decided fishing would make a great part of their game. Fish can be used to turn your pet into magical ceatures. And fishing can also get some of the rarer items in the game. The quest system is your standard. "Go kill this for me/get this for me and ill give you gold EXP and sometimes an item" its not much to talk about but its worth a mention. And mage is the only extremly remarkable class, albiet the hardest one to really lift off on.\n\nSo all in all, fate is a pretty good game. If you like dungeon crawlers then you will love this game without a doubt, if your not a fan of dungeon crawlers i still recommend it. You might just find an exception to your distaste.\n\n8/10","October 13, 2014","true","30.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/slycooperfan1/recommended/246840/","slycooperfan1","SlyCooperFan1","http://steamcommunity.com/id/slycooperfan1/","307 products in account","I received FATE through a bundle that contained other games I was interested in getting, so I did not actively seek it out. However, I'm a huge fan of some RPGs, so I figured I would try out FATE. After all, I was obsessed with WildTangent back in the day. (Still hoping for a Steam version of Blackhawk Striker 2!)\n\nSadly, FATE turned into a game that I do not wish to play. However, I would still recommend it, which is why I'm giving it a positive review.\n\nThe best way for me to describe FATE is that it's a never-ending dungeon. Whereas other RPGs will have you encounter multiple dungeons alongside the main story or as side quests, FATE is simply one gigantic dungeon. There is little story here; it's all about becoming the most famous adventurer to conquer what lies beyond the Gate next to the town of Grove. There are quests that the villagers of Grove will give you, but they're simply "Get back in that dungeon, to a specific level, and beat up this specific monster there. Get the item he drops and come back." This furthers your progress with experience, gold, and fame. Way more focus on gameplay (see below) than story.\n\nThe aesthetics are not Battlefield 4, but they completely match with the time period the game was developed in as well as in the style of RPG the game was going for. It's very much old-timey. However, don't let the graphics mislead you into thinking that this is one of the really difficult RPGs of old; it's actually quite easy to pick up and play when you get through the opening loading screens. I would have liked a tutorial or quick "here's what you're doing and how you do it" conversation with a tutorial NPC or something, but it's fine as it is. Level 1 of the dungeon is straightforward and pretty much sets the bar for what players should expect.\n\nOf note, however, is that there's a difficulty setting. I set it to Page, the easiest. So it might just be me. The hardest difficulty, Legend, might be what the veterans from old RPGs would like to start out at to really get a challenge. :P\n\nGameplay is interesting, to say the least. Battles and encounters are real-time, so you have to stay on your toes and watch where you're going. Thankfully, it's easy to discern an enemy approaching you, so you have time to react. But enemies do have various speeds, both for "walking" and for attacking. I highly appreciate that an enemy's important statistics are mentioned just by hovering over it; it's very easy to tell what it's weak or strong to.\n\nThe music and other sound effects are top-notch, and I'm definitely going to research into the FATE soundtrack after posting this review. Very enjoyable, even to just sit in town or the main menu and listen for a while.\n\ntl;dr FATE is simply one giant dungeon, but it does it pretty well. This is not my kind of game, and I didn't enjoy it as much as other people would, but I would definitely recommend it because, for the kind of RPG it is, I think it's worth a look for all RPG fans.","September 16, 2014","true","1.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

Fate is your atypical dungeon crawler.  You get quests from the villagers that correspond to the dungeon lvl you are on with either a) kill boss X or b) gain item Y requests, with the vague goal of reaching lvl 50 and killing the main boss.\n-  There is no backstory to talk of and you don't get invested in what is going on with your character or the world around you\n-   Being an older game the graphics are dated obviously but this game is a classic so that can be forgiven\n-   Simple game with a very small learning curve.\n-   Not a bad bit of mindless fun but I would recommend its spiritual successor Torchlight for a more modern take on the dungeon crawler.","May 21, 2015","true","3.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

It is a simple dungeon crawler that is a bit older but is easy to get caught up in. It came as a either a demo or the full version on a pc i had a while ago and i played it all the time. So when i saw that it was on the steam market place and the sequel had just been put on, i was thrilled! Not to mention that it was on sale for around a dollar because the sequel was just put on the store. I'm not seeing it going on sale at anytime but even so, for 5 dollars i think it is an investment you will not regret. Now just to inform you if you are going to buy it, you might have problem with it starting up. If so it is easy to look on the disscusion page on the community page for the game. Their you will find many helpful guides to get your game running. In short, Get this game!!!","May 7, 2014","true","14.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

I never knew what the game's name really was, so for years I spent quite a bit of time trying to figure out what it was so I could play it again and finally, I checked what Steam had on sale and there it was in all caps: FATE.\n\nI instantly recognized it and spent what little funds I had in my Steam wallet on it and immediately started playing. It was everything I remembered it to be and more and I fell in love with it all over again, even after all these years. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys dungeon crawlers.\n\nYup. Good game.","January 25, 2014","true","14.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I have yet to find another voice actor that I enjoy more than Henry Dardenne, and the soundtrack is unreal. All-in-all, this game is worth your money and your time.

The gameplay revolves around the simple tasks of going into dungeons to fight and coming back to town to meet with traders and fish, although that doesn't sound like much, the systems for all the tasks are so well crafted and fun that you don't really notice. The variety of enemies, spells, items and companions possible is extremely impressive for such a small game and although the gameplay is mostly similair it doesn't feel tedious at all because of ho fast paced and rewarding it's upgrade systems are, it has an excellent feeling of progression as you go along. It has little storyline, undeveloped characters, and a completely generic universe but if you're looking for a fun, low commitment game thn I highly recommend it.","July 3, 2014","true","35.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Then Fate might be for you. I've clocked in over 50 hours on this game this past year and I really had no idea what the end game goal was. I got it into my head at some point that it would all be over at Level 100. There'd be this grand baddie that I'd face off with my minions in an epic battle and I'd prove victorious. When that never happened and I was at Level 103 I became suspicious. Turns out I just had to go to floor 51. I over shot my goal by 52 floors.\n\nThat proves 2 things. One, I clearly wasn't informed of where I had to go and two, the game doesn't do a good job of informing you of your goal except at the very beginning. I would have never guessed that the old wizard at the entrance was who you needed to talk to to get your end goal. Unlike all the other town folk who have a big exclamation mark above their heads when they have quests for you the guy with the end quest was just chilling at the entrance so I never spoke to him every time I went to town. That's just poor informing on the game's part. Not to say that I didn't thoroughly enjoy this game and if I wasn't trying to complete the achievements, one of which I didn't get until I was somewhere around Level 100 I probably wouldn't have played for so long.\n\nThis game is a grind but there's lots of loot and villagers supply you with endless quests for you to keep going and going and going. Weapons and armor are plentiful but I found item enhancements to help more than picking the weapon with the highest attack power. My favorite armor was one with a defense rating of 42 but it had a bunch of buffs that increased my damage by 40% and my dexterity by 70%. It also helped that it absorbed 9% of damage dealt. You'll also find out pretty quick that your starting animal is useless. Find fish to transform it as much as you can until you get one that you can live with. I particularly liked the Ebony Stalker. Summon spells are also your friend. I can't count how many times I was killed in seconds by mobs of enemies. So get yourself a Venomous Wyvern summon and always have 6 around you. They don't do much damage but they sure do come in handy when you want enemies to target something that isn't you.\n\nThis is Duracell bunny of dungeon crawlers. That being said if you like Fate you'd love Torchlight. It's just like Fate only better and it has an actual story as a plausible reason for your dungeon crawling that comes to a clearly defined end.","May 17, 2015","true","53.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

No, really. If you like either of those games, Fate certainly deserves your attention. It has a certain innocent charm to it that fills me with a childish sense of wonder and curiosity. It makes me feel... at peace. Good. It's just fun, with a particular allure to it underneath the perhaps somewhat generic presentation.\n\nUnfortunately, it seems to me that this game is really overlooked; a hidden gem that no one has attached to their socket. I have never met anyone who's familiar with this game, and that makes me sad. So here I am spreading the word. Play Fate, now. It is... your fate. But you'll like it! In my case, I love it, and I hope that, now that it's on Steam, many other people can experience the happiness Fate brings to my heart. I'm probably being too nostaglic about this game, but I just really, really enjoyed Fate back in the day and I'm enjoying it all over again now.","February 6, 2014","true","48.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Have you played diablo 2? This game is very much like that, but it adds some things that make the hack and slash RPG better. Such things as a pet that sells stuff for you so you dont have to go back to the town when you inv full! A cool death system were you dont just respawn, you choose were and on what terms! And the best feature is that the game randomly generates almost everything! From the levels of the dungeon and quests to weapons and enemy stats! Even the games last boss is a random type of enemy on a random floor with random stats! The only con I found was that the quests are A bit rotuine, Kill X thing and get X item to bring back for X exp and X gold and X fame and sometimes a item.\n\nThis game is a lot of fun and if you like rpgs, pick it up and have a GREAT time!\n\n9/10","June 20, 2014","true","20.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I remember playing this game when I was younger, and I absolutely loved it. The cartoonish world, the eerie dungeon monsters, the completion of quests, the rare occasion of finding awesome loot; it was fantastic to younger me. Skip to 2015. I see this on the store and remember playing it, and I was like 'Hey, I used to play that game!'. I recently got into Path of Exile, and I was really enjoying the RPG based games, so I decided to buy it, and play it.\n\nIn FATE, you are a character whom resides in the town of Grove, with your faithful pet. The town is next to a dungeon, which has a series of infinite levels that are home to evil creatures, such as zombies, giant spiders and elementals. You must grind and collect gear, complete quests and upgrade your skills so you can descend deeper into the Dungeon and defeat the evil that awaits there.\n\nPROS\n- Very fun and addicting\n- Colourful and cartoonish world\n- Challenging\n- HUGE variety of weapons, armor and enchantments.\n- Dungeons are generated randomly, so it's not the same everytime.\n- You can start over and try different builds\n- Awesome feeling when you find artifacts\n\nCONS\n- The normal difficulty is VERY hard if you don't have lots of luck (which I don't).\n- It's almost impossible to fight groups of enemies past dungeon level 5 without using ALL of your healing pots or dieing (or maybe it's just bad luck).\n- Sometimes, the game will suddenly spawn HUGE amounts of monsters, such as Yetis, when I enter a room. It lags out the game completely and I am forced to run.\n- This doesn't affect much, but the narrator really annoys me.\n\nOverall, the game is very challenging and even frustrating, but all the good points balance this out.\nI rate this game 8/10.","May 1, 2015","true","15.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/loveandpeace/recommended/246840/","loveandpeace","sigh of dog","http://steamcommunity.com/id/loveandpeace/","809 products in account","I'd been wanting to play this game for many years after first hearing about it back when it was new -- a Diablo clone during the action-rpg drought of much of the 2000s, with all these nice features like a permanent pet that can hold and sell your junk for you while you adventure?  Sounded awesome.\n\nOf course, much time passed and I ended up playing Torchlight and its sequel before this game.  And on that note, I can go ahead and give you the meat of the review:\n\nTorchlight is, simply put, a better version of this game.\n\nAnd yes, I know it's by the same guys and came before Torchlight -- but there's really no reason to play this instead; there's absolutely nothing that this game does better, or even as well, and they're quite succinctly the exact same game only with Torchlight being newer and more improved.  It's not like how they're both direct clones of Diablo 1 but that game has a unique atmosphere and gamefeel that makes it still very much worth playing separately; no, these games are *the exact same thing*, except Torchlight is better.\n\nTorchlight has classes; Fate does not.  Fate makes you play a generic character whose un-alterable starting stats are those of a warrior class, even though, for example, playing as a mage is very powerful.  Likewise, Torchlight has an actual skill tree system a la Diablo 2 whereas Fate has a flat page of skills of which no playstyle will ever need to put points into more than 3 or 4 max.\n\nTorchlight has a variety of visually luscious dungeon areas, a unique backdrop to each set of floors, whereas Fate hits you with a generic and unappealing handful of locales randomly chosen floor-by-floor.  Torchlight also offers enemies cohesive to the area at which you fight them to some degree whereas Fate throws a random mishmash of almost every enemy in the game in your direction each floor, with lower floors having you see a bit more larger stuff along with 'elite' and 'legendary' versions of the smaller stuff to make their HP pools monsterous; there is no rhyme or reason.\n\nTorchlight has a massive amount of powerful equipment to find and collect, offering you many build options and ways to increase your power, while Fate quickly makes you realize a simple and painful truth; farm the shops until you have the maximum gem slots possible in every piece of equipment, then farm the mage shop until you have the required amount of superior gems, asap.  There's your endgame equipment; if you're lucky enough to find higher-tier stuff later with the required sockets then good for you, but don't hold your breath.  And this goes for all playstyles.\n\nTorchlight has a defined endgame, final floor and final boss, and then a separate 'infinite' dungeon to test your skills if you want to keep playing.  Fate gives you a randomized boss monster on a random floor and then gives you the option to go deeper in the same dungeon for no real reason.  I will say that the 'descendant' system is interesting, but is it really worth it?  Oh sure, you can become insanely powerful and tear up the dungeons for hundreds of levels if you really want, but you've seen all the game has to offer by floor 20 or so max, and by the time you get to your final boss situated 2 or 3 times deeper than that you'll be well and truly done with the game.  Even the powerful endgame unique equipment that serves as the carrot-on-a-stick for many action-RPG players is a joke, here -- as far as I can tell, you can get *all* uniques even extremely early in the game via fishing holes, and though some seems tantalizing at first you quickly realize their benefits are still not comparable to a socketed, plain version of the same item; and while a socketed unique may be the ideal, good luck with that.  You'll never find them socketed already, and if you dare spend millions of gold at the enchanter in the tiny off-chance you'll get one added (when ideally you'd want 2 or more), you're liable to revert the item to a powerless piece of scrap.\n\nSo all in all?  Yeah, no.  Skip it.  Play Diablo, Diablo 2, Diablo 3 (yes, Diablo 3), Titan Quest, Grim Dawn, Path of Exile, the Van Helsing games, and any other action-RPG before you think about this one.  And especially Torchlight.  Because it's literally the exact same game but better in every conceivable way.\n\nThat being said, I am still going to check out the other Fate games and see if they're... fated... for better reviews.  Heh.  Haha... *cough*","May 26, 2015","false","37.7"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","6","14","0","0"

So when I noticed a couple days ago that Steam had it, and that it was on sale because it is that time of the year, I jumped on it.\n\nI was playing Tl2 for the first time today, and noticed that it is VERY similar to that, there are some differences:\n\n-the character is a little chibi child looking thing, and you can only choose between a cat or a dog for a pet (BUT if you get lucky, you find a fish that can permanently change them, or just fish/buy fish that temporarily change them)\n-this is straight up dungeon crawling, no two games/levels are the same\n-no actual class picking BUT you can decide to specialize in a certain kind of weapon/magic\n-single player only\n\nJust like in Tl2, you can load your pet with things and send them to down to sell the stuff for you. Basic in game hot-buttons and controls are the same. This is basically a very simple, dungeon-crawling Tl2, if you will....but then, at the end of the day, MOST fantasy RPG are basically the same.\n\nThis is a fun, simple, kinda cute little game, easy to pick up and play (and get lost in and loose track of the time >_< LOL) Great for anyone. I'd recommend, especially since the price is good, whether on sale or not.","January 1, 2014","true","3.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Maybe they weren't that bad for their time, but there's no reason to play them anymore (assuming there ever was).  They get old quickly, and there's hardly anything to distinguish them from each other (they're so similar, I have no problem just copying and pasting the same review on each of the three that I own).  Moreover, there's nothing to distinguish them from the more recent Torchlight (not surprising, given that the Runic Games team includes ex-WildTangent devs), except Torchlight is better in every respect: better graphics, better combat, and better performance (despite being developed for Pentium systems, the FATE games still manage to overheat my Core 2 Duo gaming laptop even while running at 800x640 with minimal graphics quality).  Want to play a dungeon crawler?  Play Torchlight.  Already played Torchlight?  You're still probably better off replaying it, or playing its sequel (disclaimer: I have not).  If you really insist on getting a FATE game, I suggest starting with Cursed King, since it at least adds a little more character customization and a much-needed button to quickly swap weapon loadouts.","January 29","false","4.8"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Who's the boss? Why am I supposed to fight it? Silly me for wanting to know. It seems everything between starting a new game and facing the boss is just an endless stream of randomly generated (and thus painfully soulless) fetch quests that follow the exact same formula over and over. Not that much fun.\nNow I haven't really played much of this so I might be wrong and maybe some sort of a story kicks in later but even if that's the case it's still a rubbish design decision to give the player no sense of direction or motivation right away.\nAlso the game looks dated (though some environments do look quite compelling) AND runs like a bottom, but that's really just a minor problem compared to the dullness.\n\nSo while this is not a horrible game by any means, I can't really recommend it to anyone, maybe save for ARPG enthusiasts who want to try every game of the genre that ever came out.\n\nJust play Torchlight instead. I can't think of anything FATE does better.","November 16, 2015","false","4.5"," 6 of 16 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","6","16","0","0"

I got sucked in initially by it's subtle charm and my affinity for the genre, but frankly stayed with it to beat the game on a grudge. The loot system is flawed in that the majority of gear is unusable without certain stat requirements -- for example, to wear plate mail you'd literally have to win the game more than once, perhaps several times. That frankly is ludicrous, considering my character was literally defined as a hero of great reknown who was DRIPPING in strength-giving gear and focused on developing strength... what, is plate mail made of depleted uranium in this world? This is just one example... the vast majority of equipment you find or see in stores is reserved for people who (somehow) have the time and facination to remain on the hamster wheel. I hate-played this game just to see what was waiting for me when I finally beat the creature designated to be the target of my adventure... and it was the "opportunity" to start all over from the beginning. Bottom line - if you want to play a game like this play Diablo, or Titan Quest, or Path of Exile (which happens to be FREE!) -- those are ALL better games and finer examples of the genre. Barf. Oh, one last thing -- the difficulty scale on this game is literally offensive... it just multiplies (or divides, it would seem) monster hitpoints, and in the case of "Hero" difficulty (which I chose expecting a challenge, not a boring punishment) just makes monsters rapidly scale out of reach of being able to keep up with them. It won't make the monsters more challenging, but it WILL turn the entire game into button mashing the potion key while holding the attack button down. Also, most anti-climactic final battle ever -- it basically filled the screen with summons to the point the player cannot remain engaged to one target for more than an instant, making it literally impossible to swing more than three times at the same creature before dying. Luckily there is a (stupid) mechanic in the game that allows you to respawn exactly where you died at the loss of some xp and (mostly pointless) fame, so to beat the boss, (or anything for that matter) you merely need to swing twice before you die where you stand and keep coming back UNTIL you kill enough of the annoying summoners to face off with the boss, and if needed die numerous times to get him as well. Awful. Awful. Awful. If you played the game as a youngster and feel the need to retread this path somehow, be my guest. Those without the benefit of nostalgia have been warned.","September 21, 2015","false","25.2"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

Why? Because the game is ridiculously hard to even maintain a pace with. Its a dungeon crawler. At first it is a piece of cake but then as you start getting down lower in the dungeons you will start to get your ♥♥♥ handed to you on a regular basis due to the game sending armies of these creatures at you at the same time, and each time you get killed, you get three choices as to how you want to respawn. The first causes you to lose experience and they will drop you right back where you died. Unfortunately the enemies are still waiting for you and will proceed to gang up on you and beat you to dust where you will become angry and choose choice number two which takes some exp but spawns you on a nearby level. This nearby level could be either levels up, or down, from where you died. The problem with this is that as you make your way back to where you were, the levels are now loaded with powerful enemies, even if you already cleared them,  who will stomp you into mud in no time flat. You will get VERY ANGRY indeed at this game and I predict, unless you are the unusually stubborn type, that you will just leave and never come back again, OR, you will cheat and ruin the experience. See my guide on cheating in the steam version because NO ONE is gonna help you amongst these cry baby anti cheaters, lol. End of story. Money spent on a game that will ♥♥♥♥ you off.

I bought it first.   My point is about gaming experience and uniqueness of experience.  It's not like you're waiting for the next one to be released.  You can choose to spend on Fate, Fate Undiscovered realms, Torchlight I or Torchlight II.\n\nTorchlight II has added game experience which makes it best.   The other three are almost identical, so if I'm going to choose one of them, it'll be Torchlight I because it has better achievements.\n\n-----\n\nI bought this recently.  I had never played it previously.    I have played both Torchlight games.   This game and the first Torchlight could be clones of one another.   I honestly can't think of one thing that differs.\n\nGet five attribute points to distribute per level up - check.  Get a skill point to apply to warrior skill, mage skill or ranged weapon skill - check.   Have a pet - check.  Can transform pet - check.  Use fish to transform pet - check.\nUse portal scroll to navigate to most recent level and go down a level - check.   Gamble - check.\n\nThe game itself is good enough, but save yourself the money, go buy Torchlight II.

It's an RPG that could be considered the father of Torchlight.  Made a few years earlier, it incorporates a number of things that Torchlight did, particularly the use of the pet as both a beast of burdon and as an ally which is transformable by fish.  It has randomly generated dungeons, which is always nice, and has been produced well.\n\nThat said, I am finding it a bit boring.  As a fighter specialising in swords, I've found most of the drops to be magic-geared, or aimed at axe-wielders.  I'd say about 95% of the drops are of no interest to me at all, and this tends to make hacking your way through the levels a bit monotonous.\n\nI'm also finding it annoying that it is all too easy to die in the game, especially if you're focusing on what's happening on-screen.  The warning that health is low seems to come too late, so you end up having to divide your attention between the fighting and supervising the health bar.  The pet also seems to spend about 50% of its time fleeing.\n\nMy last moan is that the resolution doesn't seem adjustable, and I'm finding that I'd like to be able to zoom out a little more and with more detail - many of the characters seem rather large and chunky, as though this game was aimed at kids.\n\nAll said though, the game is cheap enough, and I bought my copy during a sale.  If you like RPGs, give it a go.","January 28, 2015","true","31.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a pretty simple concept really, but the execution was very, very, good.

Yeah there are some hard bosses, but even though it's pretty tough in some levels. You do get three options when you die which is great because you don't have start all the way back to town. There are town portals which makes it easier when you are doing quest or need more potion. You can replay dungeons to get more gold or more experience points.

That said, the story is essentially non-existent and the gameplay is pretty shallow - you basically just run through randomly-generated dungeons killing hordes of monsters while completing meaningless quests. Gameplay follows a pretty simple formula:\n- Go to town. Buy gear. Get quests.\n- Go to dungeon. Kill monsters. Find loot. Complete quests.\n- Go back to town. Sell loot. Get quest rewards.\nAnd then you more or less just repeat until you get bored. It's pretty standard dungeon-crawler faire.\nNow, if you really like generic dungeon crawlers and are a big fan of the action/RPG genre, you'll probably have fun with this game, though you might be better off going with something like Titan Quest if you want a bit more depth.\nIn sum, FATE is a good game to pick up if you're just looking for a simple dungeon-crawler to play. It won't be the greatest game you play all year, but it won't be the worst either. All things considered, it's worth the $7.99 price tag.","April 29, 2014","true","23.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I haven't played it on Steam yet as I just purchased it on here, but I did play the game when WildTangent first released it.  The game is fun and fairly unique, and it is hugely replayable as the dungeon and quests are randomized every time.  I would recommend this game to everyone I know, especially at the low cost (and even more so with the game on sale).  A couple of tips to anyone playing for the first time: the first thing you should buy is a fishing rod (you can fish in the town and in the dungeon, and sell some of the stuff for a lot of money), and, if you don't want a floor to "reset," leave at least on crate/urn/jar/whatever unbroken/unopened/unactivated or leave at least one enemy alive.","April 19, 2014","true","35.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I know it's a poor mans diablo, but it has some things diablo doesn't. Like the loot. You Don't have to buy any weapons or armor to make it through the hardest level like you do in diablo. All you have to do is get some magic find gear, like the cheese head from emerald bay, and do some fishing. By the way, about the only way to get the cheese head, is to fish for it. Right in town is the best place to get one. It might take awhile but you can still catch some lower level artifacts in town to help make starting your game easier. When I started playing I got all of my yellow gear from fishing. By the way the dog is the best animal to have while fishing. The rest of the animals are distracting. The game play is fun, and very easy point and click, can't beat that. The graphics are not to bad for what it is. But the music in the dungeon sucks so I play with the sound off.

I would recommend this game to everyone I know, especially at the low cost (and even more so with the game on sale).  A couple of tips to anyone playing for the first time: the first thing you should buy is a fishing rod (you can fish in the town and in the dungeon, and sell some of the stuff for a lot of money), and, if you don't want a floor to "reset," leave at least on crate/urn/jar/whatever unbroken/unopened/unactivated or leave at least one enemy alive.","April 19, 2014","true","35.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In addition, gambling with Zim could either sink your cash with horrible purchases or make a huge profit off of great items. Unfortunately, the quests given by the townsfolk are often monotonous and repetitive when you reach the lower dungeon levels and the items you recieve after completion are often worse than ones you have equipped. Overall, even though this game is rather old, the classic RPG game stylings create a nostalgic feeling even when it gets monotonous.","January 15, 2014","true","10.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's an RPG that could be considered the father of Torchlight.  Made a few years earlier, it incorporates a number of things that Torchlight did, particularly the use of the pet as both a beast of burdon and as an ally which is transformable by fish.  It has randomly generated dungeons, which is always nice, and has been produced well.\n\nThat said, I am finding it a bit boring.  As a fighter specialising in swords, I've found most of the drops to be magic-geared, or aimed at axe-wielders.  I'd say about 95% of the drops are of no interest to me at all, and this tends to make hacking your way through the levels a bit monotonous.\n\nI'm also finding it annoying that it is all too easy to die in the game, especially if you're focusing on what's happening on-screen.  The warning that health is low seems to come too late, so you end up having to divide your attention between the fighting and supervising the health bar.  The pet also seems to spend about 50% of its time fleeing.\n\nMy last moan is that the resolution doesn't seem adjustable, and I'm finding that I'd like to be able to zoom out a little more and with more detail - many of the characters seem rather large and chunky, as though this game was aimed at kids.\n\nAll said though, the game is cheap enough, and I bought my copy during a sale.  If you like RPGs, give it a go.","January 28, 2015","true","31.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

On top of that, get it off here (Steam), and play relax a bit as you play it on and off.

Don't be fool by my game time i played it like for more than 12 hours and finished it. Fate is a simple and old game, it's a really fun dungeon crawler game.\n\nThe NPCs gives 1-3 level high quest depending on what dungeon level you are on, which is really convenient if you are heading to the main quest dungeon. The bad part about it is that once you've reach a dungeon level you can't get the quest in the dungeon you are in or any dungeon below your current dungeon you've explored, some quest have normal rewards but others have item rewards, but in this case you can manage the quest that you wanted to do even though it is limited.\n\nThe monsters in every level is different and they have different types of attacks, if you're making a summoner build you are going to die... a lot... so its best to cover up your character weaknesses.\n\nOne of the best part in this game is that you are able to turn your pet into a monster( not like slime, goblin or anything that has 2 hands and 2 legs) by feeding him fish, the fish you fed to your pet have a duration of how long your pet can be turned into a monster, you can turn your pet into a monster permanently if you want. And yes you can go fishing in the game in town or in the dungeon if you're lucky you can get rare items just by fishing.\n\nFinally the skills in the game, there is no skill perk trees just old fashion Str, Dex, Vit and Int. But instead of a skill tree you can spend points on Weapon skills, Critical strike, Spell cast time, Attack spell level, Defence spell level and Charm spell level. You can use magic too, you can choose to buy them from a NPCs or explore the dungeon for it.\n\n9/10 my childhood is complete","July 12, 2015","true","12.0"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

The different levels and monsters are well designed and always have a central theme to tie everything together. The ability to have a pet is a nice feature, and the use of different fish to transform your pet into a monster to help you in battle gives the fishing mini-game a good reason to be played.
