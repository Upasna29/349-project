Assuming you're into rpg's (otherwise i don't see any reason you're here), and want to get your mind blown away, then this game is for you. I can't possibly describe how fantastic Witcher 2 is. While the "general" story might not be something outstanding, the way you progress through it, the way you interact with people completely engulfs you into the experience, and you won't even realize when it's already 5 am, and you've been playing for 12 hours at least. This is partly because of the side missions. Unlike other rpg's where they are mediocre at best, and mainly consist of something like "Get to point B, Talk to someone, Return, ????, PROFIT", side missions in Witcher 2 are self contained stories, some of them being more enjoyable than the main game itself. And of course if you don't want to do them for whatever reason, you'll miss A LOT.\nAnother thing at which Witcher 2 excels is the combat. While at low difficulty you should be able to complete the game by "pressing X to win", other difficulty settings require knowledge, thinking, and tactical aproach. You'll have to create mixtures, craft weapons and armor, find or buy herbs and recipes, just in order to be able to survive. While this might be confusing, and hard, trust me that it's not. It's understandable, it's logical, and requires just a little bit of initial effort.\nAt this point you're probably thinking "Yeah, cool, i'll go buy it", and you won't be wrong in any way. BUT, be advised that while this is a great looking game, it isn't particulary well optimised,  and you may find yourself struggling even at minimum settings if your PC isn't powerful enough.\nSo what is my score for the game? Definitely 10/10. I really do think it's such a good game.","November 25, 2013","true","43.4"," 1,643 of 1,760 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","643","1","0","24"

I do like games that have deep and mature narratives.  I also like games with complex combat mechanics.  I heard that this game was very good at these things, so I decided to give it a try.\n\nThe story is  very good.  It is also very complex so it is important to pay attention to the dialog.  Player choices definitely have an impact on the game world and many choices are morally ambiguous which tie-in well to the mature theme of the story.  What impressed me the most was how much impact player choice dynamically altered the game world and the direction of the story.  The game has 8 different endings based on the player's decisions.  This is also the only game that I have ever played that completely alters the main quest line depending on these choices.  This means that you will not see every main story quest, characters and locations unless you play the game through multiple times.  Many games that change the world based on choices usually do so using trickery that gives you the "illusion" of choice.  The developers of this game actually took the time to create all of the extra story content instead of using tricks and this gives the Witcher 2 a ton of replayability.\n\nThe combat system in this game is also very deep and challenging.  You will carry a steel sword to take care of humanoid opponents and you will carry a silver sword to deal with monsters.  Knowing when to switch is important to dealing proper damage to your target.  Combat also requires proper preparation so the player will need to know how and when to use magical signs, place traps, drink potions, oil swords and use bombs and other Witcher tricks to get the job done.  Simply wading into the combat only slashing away with a sword will often times get you killed.  Combat can take some time to get used to and is definitely a refreshing departure from simply auto targeting and mashing a single button.\n\nVisuals are very impressive and it is very apparent that the developers took a lot of time in creating the environments for the game.  Music is outstanding and the score sets the tone appropriately.\n\nOne of the few downsides that I can think of is the disparity of the difficulty levels.  Normal difficulty can be daunting with the complex combat mechanics and is a bit harder than the normal difficulty level of similar games.  Easy is a nod to RPG beginners, but is so easy that you can ignore most of the combat mechanics and simply survive every encounter by using only the swords.  The only other downside that I had with the game was related to map design.  I found navigation on some of the maps to be overly complicated and I spent a lot of time simply wandering about trying to find a way to get to certain points on the map.  Other than these two small quibbles I found the game design to be very solid and entertaining.\n\nLots of content in this game.  My playthrough took about 40 hours doing most of the side activities, and I mostly took my time without rushing things.  Additional playthroughs would be required to see the other 7 endings and to play the other story paths leading up to those endings.  You can easily get hundreds of hours out of this game if you wanted to explore all of these options so lots of replay value as I mentioned earlier.\n\nI highly recommend this game.  I understand that the Witcher 3 is supposed to expand to a much more open world environment and have even more non-linear story options.  After playing Witcher 2 I am looking forward to playing the upcoming sequel when it comes out.","January 26, 2014","true","50.4"," 680 of 716 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","680","716","0","10"

If you're thinking about purchasing this, know that to get the most out of this game you need to be prepared to fully immerse yourself in the experience and pay attention to what is going on. This a game which deals with many adult themes such as politics, racism and sex to deliver a mature and complex game supported by rich lore and stunning visuals.\n\nThe writing and storytelling is exceptional throughout and the moral ambiguity and choices are second to none. The gameplay, in particular the combat, is an acquired taste but offers a refreshing level of depth and potential for improvisation when compared to games in a similar genre. Sound design and voice acting is also of high quality, with the environments coming to life through impressive visual and audio support and characters each sporting distinct personalities and prejudices.\n\nIt is also worth mentioning that if you have played the first Witcher game, your choices and gear will be reflected via an imported save in The Witcher 2, however the choices have limited effect and it is not necessary to play the first game to enjoy the second (however you will be at a slight disadvantage in some situations).\n\nIn my honest opinion the experience as a whole is unparalleled, and The Witcher 2 is easily the most enjoyable and immersive RPG I have played in recent memory. I would also advise reading the books, in particular The Last Wish, Blood of Elves, Time of Contempt and Baptism of Fire as these offer an interesting insight into the protagonist's past. But back to the game, overall I would highly recommend The Witcher 2 to anyone with at least a passing interest in the RPG genre, it is the definition of a complete gaming package with spectacular production values and a lasting impression.","November 26, 2013","true","139.2"," 833 of 908 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","833","908","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nomedemon/recommended/20920/","nomedemon","[AReV]Nomed","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nomedemon/","1050 products in account","Originally released in 2011, The Witcher 2 flew under the radar for a lot of people and was overshadowed by the ever-popular Skyrim. While not as well known, The Witcher 2 offers a much stronger narrative along with solid gameplay, beautiful graphics, and varied areas.\n\nYou once again play as the Witcher; Geralt, who finds himself protecting King Foltest of Temaria after an assassination attempt. Ultimately, the second attempt succeeds and Geralt is framed for the murder. After escaping from a Temarian dungeon, Geralt decides to track down the real kingslayer in order to clear his name while trying to piece together his fragmented memory.\n\nThe game is separated into three chapters each with their own main area along with a handful of side-quests. These areas are structured and paced well, allowing room for exploration without straying too far from the main storyline. The decisions you make along the way directly influence the narrative and can have a dramatic effect on the rest of the game. For example; decisions made in the first chapter can completely change the second, allowing plenty of room for re-playability. The game also features multiple endings, which vary based on your choices.\n\nThe choices are morally ambiguous; there is no clear right or wrong answer in most cases. It’s more about choosing a side and watching the events unfold. While the first Witcher game focused more on slaying monsters, Geralt is trapped in the middle of political turmoil in this installment. These elements of the story add an additional level of complexity and immersion as the game feels almost similar to a season of Game of Thrones. Playing the first game is by no means necessary to enjoying The Witcher 2 as it provides plenty of backstory as well as a solid and cohesive narrative.\n\nThe combat is solid as the game will have you balance between swordplay, magic, as well as parrying and dodging. The use of traps can also add an additional level of strategy and planning to most encounters. There is also the inclusion of alchemy, allowing Geralt to drink various potions each with different passive bonuses as well as negative side effects. The potions are generally used on a trial and error basis though, since Geralt isn’t able to use them during combat. The game does provide a reasonable challenge, especially on the harder difficulties, which is refreshing compared to a lot of other titles released these days.\n\nOrens, the main currency in the game is rather scarce, placing a large emphasis on crafting. The crafting system is solid and will have you hoarding as many resources as possible in order to create various armor, traps, weapons, and upgrades.\n\nCD Projekt Red is a company that really loves their fans. While other developers release paid DLC, CDPR released an Enhanced Edition at no additional cost which added multiple cut-scenes, quests, and additional polish.\n\nThe soundtrack is fantastic, as it really adds an epic feel to the game. The voice acting for the main characters is top-notch while some of the acting for the additional characters is re-used but that is to be expected considering the overall length of the game.\n\nThe graphics are absolutely stunning, as the environments are extremely detailed and varied. The character models and armor look great, although the facial animations can be a bit stiff and lifeless at times. You really have to look hard for low-res textures as even the smallest objects are carefully rendered.\n\nOverall, The Witcher 2 is a game that should be played by anyone that is a fan of the genre. It features benchmark graphics, a top-shelf narrative, and offers plenty of content along with elements of re-playability.\n\nFor a much more detailed and thorough review, here’s a video I edited together for my friend Trent:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEPbEpWHMeo\n\nThe Witcher 2 also made our list for the greatest games released over the past 8 years. If you’re curious to see how it stacks up, check out:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIHmom_lP4\n\nPros:\n+ Choices actually shape the game adding elements of re-playability\n+ Excellent graphics\n+ Engaging main quest and side quests\n+ Combat massively improved from the first title\n+ Solid Voice Acting\n\nCons\n- No potions in combat can lead to trial and error\n- Stiff Facial Animations\n- I experienced a few bugs and random crashes. (This wasn’t a huge deal though since the game has frequent auto-saves.)\n\n\nIf you enjoyed this review, feel free to follow me as a Steam Curator: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/4886473/","February 19, 2014","true","51.4"," 346 of 375 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","346","375","0","33"

Too often a game preaches where choices matter and regardless of what you choose the outcome is the same.  This title puts you back in the hands of Geralt of Rivia; however, this time, the consequences of your actions merit even greater twists and deeper turns.  Not only changing the NPC's outlook on you; instead, you may find yourself in a completely different area of the game had you chosen your actions otherwise.  To stack on the improvements, this game features a much smoother combat system and graphical enhancements so beautiful, you will need a new F12 key (screenshot) by the time you finish this story once.\n\nAs an avid explorer of games, one play through of this game granted roughly 50 hours of play time on Hard difficulty.  With bigger titles for $60 giving a mere 10 hours of game play, at $20 this instalment is steal already, let alone when it is discounted.  If you enjoyed the first game, or even if you hated the first game and couldn't get over the combat, this should make its way to your library.","November 2, 2014","true","55.5"," 242 of 255 people (95%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","95","242","255","4","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sonolythyc/recommended/20920/","sonolythyc","PDK","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sonolythyc/","104 products in account","Witcher 2 is my favorite game. It is a solid RPG with a lot of action and a brilliant story. It is very mature in a lot of its themes and situations. This game is based on novels written by a Polish authornamed  Andrzej Sapkowski. You play as Geralt, a Witcher, or a genetically enhanced monster hunter. They have been described as a kind of warrior monk. Geralt drinks special potions that let him far exceed the abilities of normal humans. These potions are needed to battle the various beasts of the realms. Witchers also have a very limited understanding of magical energy called Witcher's Signs. Basically the Signs are spells, like a fireball and a paralysis trap spell and a few others. Geralt is an interesting character because he is not quite human but hes not a monster either. Due to their methods and abilities, however, many in the world see Witchers as freaks and monsters. Which is really what the game's ideology is all about; the greyness in everyone, not the clear cut black and white. Which to me, is a welcome change from the usual: 1) "hey I'm a good guy I will help you"  2) "Not my problem Kachinsky" 3) F*** YOU F*** FACE," that many other game are notorious for.  Geralt is often put in positions of just making a choice, not good or evil, just difficult decisions that have a lot of positives and negatives to them. The story is top notch, and eerily real in many of the stuggles of the world.\n\nGeralt has a set of skill trees (sword, magic, alchemy) that the player can advance in any way. All into one or spliced between the three. Sword fighting is a core mechanic though, so no matter how you play, Geralt will always have two swords. A silver sword for monsters, and a normal sword for humans. There are a few other weapons too but mostly its swords. Depending on the player preference combat can be a bit like the Batman games, or the Assassins Creed games. In some ways it can be like Chivalry: Medieval Warfare. Weapons and armor play a big part as well and can effect all of the skill trees. Making the game very balanced between gear and character tree choices. Not to the crazy levels of a Diablo game but enough to make for a very quality rpg.\n\nMostly though, Witcher 2 is a lot like skyrim. I do not want to bash on skyrim here, it is also a great game that a lot of people absolutely love. I feel, however, that Witcher is far better than skyrim and think the people that love skyrim should try the Witcher. Both games have the northern lore and feel. Witcher 2 is no where near as large or open as skyrim. Witcher is much more linear but the story and combat and the world just feel so much better in every way to me. The enemies and the different races were better portrayed during the game. When I came to a new town in skyrim I did not get that feeling of truly new. Just another town and another barbarian guy leading it. Witcher was totally different, you get the feeling of racial tensions and social tensions in every part. The powers that be are very different and each very developed and very human. As it plays out you really see how the choices alter the world, instead of it coming down to "OK I'm a good guy so I will save good guy town." A lot of games try to get that feeling across of the characters true M.O. and demeanor but fail. Witcher acomplishes this very well. Triple AAA quality. Superb graphics, superb voice acting. I enjoyed every character. There were a few times, of course, where some tones were a bit off but that happens in every game. Overall amazing game. When I learned that this game was made by a small studio in Poland I was shocked.\n\nAs someone who never read any of the books and did not play the first game, I found that after a second playthrough the story and everyhting started to click and I realised how well done everything really was. The way the game is, one would want to play it at least twice to see both sides of what is going on.\nIt seems as though more than a few people found the game to be really difficult. It can be, but now there are plenty of guides and discussions about it. The game has a kind of reverse curve for the difficulty. It is much harder in the beginning due to a lack of points in the skill tree and low grade weapons and armor. By the end though, Geralt is pretty much on par with jezuz. I like games of this nature, because being really stong at the end makes it feel like you really acomplished something.\n\nThis game also has subtitles in many languages so I found it made a great gift for steam friends who are not natural to the english language.\n\nI would reccommend this game to anyone. Especially anyone who likes Skyrim, Assassin's Creed, Batman, Chivalry, Darksouls, Lord of the Rings or any games like them.","December 30, 2014","true","226.9"," 188 of 199 people (94%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","94","188","199","5","2"

So here goes.\n\nThe first RPG I played where your choices actually DO matter (*cough* Mass Effect *cough*). Yes, I kid you not. Not only does the game split up after Act I depending on who you choose to side with, but the outcome of dialogues in the main quest and even the side quests offer multiple possibilites for the story to unfold. The complexity and ingenuity of the fantasy world this game is set in is comparable to the quality of GRRM's A Song of Ice and Fire and can therefore be characterized as a so-called "low fantasy" story, as opposed to "high fantasy" settings such as The Elder Scrolls (just google the definitions if you don't know anything about them). Personally, I prefer low fantasy due to its focus on individual character development and their story/fate, as well as a "realistic" depiction of violence, language and society as a whole, but that's just my preference. So in a nutshell, I liked the story a lot, I think there's a lot of exciting things still to be told.\n\nNow let's get to the technical aspects: Dialogue is great, offering many choices for convincing or intimidating and alike. Character customization is solid too (you can actually have your haircut changed to some very weird stuff throughout the game if you so desire), there's lots of item slots, but only two weapons, a fact I can however accept for story reasons. Then again, I always pick the sword in any fantasy RPG so having two different swords throughout the entire game was right down my alley.\nSince we've arrived at the swords let's talk about the combat shall we. Yeah, I don't like it, why don't I like it you might say? It's basically a combo-based hack'n'slash system with a very console-y feeling (believe me or not, I liked Skyrim combat more, yes really). You just lock onto a target and smash LMB/RMB with the occasional blocking. I think this is simplistic and may be fun to watch, but it's not really immersive (on a side note: the combat is pretty hard and the boss fight require true skill and creativity and especially cunning use of magic abilities, I liked these a lot more). Speaking of immersive, the game looks gorgeous for a 2011 title, mostly good textures and effects. What struck me was the very high depth of field especially in the first act. I guess that's a way to make the lack of quality of distant objects unnoticable. Arguably, the biggest plus is the sound: ambient sound, voice acting and especially soundtrack are downright masterful, I loved it.\n\nI can't think of anything else atm so let's jump to the conclusion. The game is great, with lots of replayability due to the many different paths you can go. The world sucks you in right from the start. If you're a fan of the combat then you've got absolutely nothing to fear, if you don't it's still worth it for the experience because mechanics are easy to get used to.\n\nPerformance notes: The game is Nvidia optimized. With my AMD card(s), it runs a solid 60fps though. Just tweak AA a bit and turn off Cinematic Depth of Field, it makes cutscene-fps drop by half, which is not cool. It supports CFX and probably also SLI. Oh yeah and the game is capped to 120fps, which is nice too.\n\nMeaningless score: 9/10","October 11, 2014","true","24.9"," 188 of 201 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","188","201","2","4"

When i first played this game, I was totally mindblown at how mature the storyline and how beautiful the graphics are.\n\nI was and still baffled how almost nobody in Malaysia knows about this game when it first came out. A problem that still persists up till now.\n\nThis is not a game for the kiddies but I am sure this kind of game is recommended for people to understand gray moral choices that will somewhat help in real life decisions.\n\nThe drawback:\n\n- controls are sometimes clunky (sometimes not being able to hit monsters when the target reticule is not on it, or Geralt performs a heavy attack when in actual you're pressing the light attack button)\n\n- crashes frequently when I load a save game (happens when there is a bloat of save games)\n\n- Tiring grind to get loads of gold to get and craft the Dark Armour Diagrams and materials. (you can only get Dark Armour in Dark Mode)\n\nThe Pros:\n\n- Great Mature Storyline\n- Great Graphics for a 2011 game\n- Decent Moral Choices\n- Difficult Combat for newcomers but it will grow on you once you get the hang of it! (Pro Tips: DODGE! DODGE! DODGE!)\n- A developer who has managed to stay independent and still able to developed this great game\n- No DRM if you register the steam version on GOG.com for a backup copy for free!

I've now played this game 3 times through on Normal/Dark/Insane and am still missing a few sidequests that are only available on certain plot decisions. This game is massive and very well done. Here are some random pros & cons for things that immediately come to mind:\n\nPROS\n+ Gorgeous. This game is gorgeous. Especially if you grab an improved textures mod. (see related con)\n+ Story-rich. The story is grandiose and tons of fun to be a part of. There are quite a few story-altering decisions you will make throughout the game as well, providing a dynamic and involved experience.(one decision determines a good third of the game that differs completely should you have chosen differently) There were a couple choices where I had to pause the game for like 20 minutes while trying to decide what I wanted to do. Intense stuff. LISTEN TO ALL DIALOGUE, TALK TO EVERYONE. You won't regret it.\n+ Combat is very dynamic and an absolute blast. You really need to think about the best way to approach certain encounters. Alchemy can alter things drastically for example, so don't skimp on the potions/oils(especially on higher difficulties!). Certain enemies need to be approached certain ways, some are very resistant to sword or magic, some can shield up and block all damage so you need to approach them from another direction or use a specific sign, etc... Very well done and very well thought out by the development team.\n\n\nPROS/CONS(depending on your preferences/playstyle)\n+/- Game starts out pretty damn difficult during the prologue. You start very weak and then slowly gain strength until all at once, you are suddenly quite over-powered. This could be a pro or con depending on what sort of gaming experience you prefer. There *are* a couple mods that smooth out the combat system and even out your ascension to badassness, although I would highly recommend you not touch any sort of mods til you've completed your first playthrough.\n+/- Quite a bit of nudity and corny sex scenes. May or may not be your cup of tea.\n\nCONS\n- While the game is gorgeous, it is also quite resource intensive. I had serious issues with my 560m, almost unplayable. My desktop's gtx 780 had no issues. Check out benchmarks for your specific card and make sure you can run it decently.\n- QTE's(Quicktime Events) are a part of this game and they are lame. There are a couple encounters where if you miss a QTE prompt, you are dead. Playing on insane, this feels cheap and lame. *Luckily*, You can turn these off via Gameplay Options, which I would highly recommend.\n- Prologue is pretty damn linear. Don't let this turn you off though. It's necessary for the introduction of the story. Make it to chapter 1 and things improve greatly.\n- A lot of people have reported that the controls feel "clunky", especially during the prologue. I was one of these people. But seriously, stick with it. It gets better. Also, graphic settings affect control sensitivity. Higher = better response. I also played the game with a controller, so that could have some impact.\n\nOverall conclusion: If you like RPGs, this is a must play. The story is intense and exciting. The gameplay is dynamic and fun. I highly recommend you give it a go. Just make it past the prologue! Also, a few people have asked whether it's necessary to play the first game. My answer is NO. It's not necessary. You would benefit from watching a story recap on YouTube though.","June 15, 2014","true","99.1"," 127 of 133 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","127","133","0","5"

My first exposure being the book, “The Last Wish” by Andrzej Sapkowski. I started in on Witcher 1 after reading and found the mechanics slightly overbearing. Even with some background I found myself being overwhelmed by the vastness and seeming complexity of the mechanics brought fourth by what, to me, was a very cool prospect. Alchemy.\n\nThe idea behind it was not as its traditionally seen, even in fantasy. It wasn't some equal exchange of two completely unrelated things. Or when it was considered theoretical science, turning common metal into gold. It was poison, concocted from traditional alchemical ingredients. This poison would kill anyone not used to it. It took years and years of borderline torture to build this resistance. All in exchange for what was essentially, a high. Which in game mechanics turns into stat buffs and regen of various meters. AND on top of all this people were kidnapped before the age of five, trained in swordsmanship and forced to build a tolerance to the poisonous alchemical drinks. All to become “thugs for hire” and slay monsters. That, is the coolest ♥♥♥♥ ever.\n\nSadly I never completed the Witcher 1. Due to the overbearing nature. Suffice it to say. The Witcher 2 is a vast improvement. Mechanically, Narratively, and boy is she pretty.\n\nMy first play through I found some of that residual vastness to get to me. But I decided to forge ahead. I found myself understanding the times at which potions were needed and when they were not, even if most of time was due to trial and error. I am sort of an obsessive quick-saver. I found the dichotomy between Steel and Silver swords very real. Making the action feel much more tactical than your standard, run into that room and whack at stuff with a sharp stick.\n\nYou make decisions in this game like every other RPG. Only these choices are not so clear cut. There isn't really ever a clearly good or clearly bad option. Moral ambiguity at its best. Rather both sides seem to have very real unforeseen consequences. In fact in the mission “At a Crossroads”, Literally 20+ hours of content lay behind a single choice. My second play through I had a lot more fun because I could focus less on worrying about how to spec or do I have enough ingredients for the potion I need. I was able to focus on the story and actually see some of the political tension much more clearly and take a stance that was well informed.\n\nI love this world. Its probably the most fleshed out fantasy world I've gotten involved with. That's likely due to the fact that this game is based on a book series and not vice versa. Much in the way the Metro 2033 series is.\n\nNo prerequisite reading required to enjoy but it will definitely enhance the experience.","December 11, 2014","true","43.2"," 120 of 130 people (92%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","92","120","130","7","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mm3n/recommended/20920/","mm3n","m3iɳitƴ ☯","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mm3n/","2330 products in account","Easily one of the best PC games released in the latest years. Easily one of the best surprises, too - you will see more passion and talent from those 'noobs' from Poland than you would in most of the AAA studios, combined. The sheer idea to be a rather indie studio and create a game like this, polish it (word origin nudges me weirdly here) and bring it to the extent it is available today, is remarkable and admiring.\n\nI have spent countless hours in the summer of 2011 playing and replaying the game. Because you don't get one strict and direct walkthrough; in fact, you can play 2 completely different storylines and make choices that will result in 16 (!) different endings. Mind you, I haven't seen them all (yet), but some craze at some point in the future might make me want to do so.\n\nWitcher 2 is an action-adventure RPG - you will see a lot of combat, and the combat mechanics will matter when you face tougher foes. You need a strategy to survive - button mashing won't help you. You can master either of the 3 skill paths - Magic, Alchemy and Swordmanship and use your signs, potions and gear in order to kick every monster and merc's a** in the beautiful world of Witcher 2.\n\nSpeaking of beauty, as long as you have a powerful enough PC to push the game hard, you can't fail to notice how lovely it is made - the whole world looks like it is living and breathing, with NPCs having their own business throughout the day and sleep at night, lights, shadows and colours that make it all look hell pretty - the game might be 2011, but it still easily competes with some weaker attempts from more recent times.\n\nEverything in this game screams for maturity - from the portrayal of the storyline to some rather odd moments in the game - you might think nudity is not appropriate for games, but if you are old enough to think about it normally, you'll see there's nothing bad in a beautiful love scene like in any other movie. And indeed, the fantasy world of Witcher 2 is not a fantasy world meant for putting kids to sleep - it can easily be described as an alternative Middle Ages where humans have all their present strong and weak qualities, and the legends about the monsters lurking outside of the village at night turn out to actually be there for real.\n\nComparing it to the first installment of the series, I would say I prefer Witcher 2 over it's predecessor, even though I wouldn't deny it either. Everything looks better thought of and finished in the follow-up, but the truth is, the Witcher 1 forged the path for the developers to get together and release a game like this. If you wonder, definitely play the first one first, but come back here when you've finished it.\n\nIf you are at least a tiny little bit fan of books, don't think twice and grab yourself a copy of the Witcher stories- Andrzej Sapkowski is the mastermind of this world (book came first, then the game). Stories are not necessarily strictly connected between the books and the game, they are loosely situated in the same world, with the main protagonist being the white-haired cold-blooded and serious monster killer Geralt of Rivia. Who, by the way, is already one of my most favourite characters overall.\n\nIn a few words - if you don't have the game yet and you are a fan of RPG, deep and mature stories and beautiful graphics: get it, get it now.\n\n\n\nP.S. Devs are real nowadays heroes as they release a ton of free downloadable content and updates AFTER the game is released. Yep, you get all those DLCs you pay for in the other games for free - and they added the Enhanced edition for free for all early purchasers too. They are also known for bashing the mandatory nowadays DRM too - if you buy the game retail, you just need the disc to play it. Like in the good old days.\n\nP.S. 2 I own the retail Collector's Edition of the game and I just had to buy it again on Steam. I don't mind it at all, I would put my money for those guys any day, as long as they keep releasing games like this (blink blink: Witcher 3; blink blink: Cyberpunk).","February 16, 2014","true","4.7"," 162 of 188 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","162","188","0","10"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BavarianGod/recommended/20920/","BavarianGod","[AReV]BavarianGod","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BavarianGod/","3478 products in account","http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEPbEpWHMeo\n\n*I originally purchased a retail copy of The Witcher 2 and completed it before purchasing a steam copy at a later date*\n\nThe Witcher 2 was perhaps one of the most criminally overlooked games of 2011. With many RPG gamers looking forward to the release of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim this PC only release was lost in the hyperbolic praise of Bethesda's role playing juggernaut during end of the year awards. So, in 2012, CDProjekt Red has released an enhanced edition giving PC players ten gigabytes of additional content for free. This content includes all of the patches which added extra quests and fixed a couple of questionable design choices, adds entirely new quests, and cut scenes to flesh the game's narrative out.\n\nThe Enhanced Edition opens with a rousing new cut scene depicting the assassination of Demavend, King of Aedirn. Upon starting the game the you take control of the witcher, Geralt, who is aiding Kind Foltest in a military endeavor to reclaim his ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ children. Success comes but the victory is short lived as Foltest is snuffed out and Geralt is blamed for his demise. From here the narrative takes off as Geralt hunts down Foltest's assassin simply to clear his name. Amidst the hunt for the assassin of kings, political turmoil unfolds and Geralt seeks details on his lost love Yennifer. It's a top shelf fantasy RPG narrative, structured like a great season of a television show, with three big narrative threads that are explored as the game progresses. Like a television show, the game ends with some elements of the narrative resolved while others are escalating and awaiting a sequel. The world of the Witcher is dark and morally ambiguous which makes the element of choice the player us given extraordinarily satisfying. Making choices in The Witcher 2 is not about being a good witcher or a bad witcher, its about what you, the player, see fit to do. While Bioware's games are top notch, relegating in-game choices to a binary moral scale diminishes the impact of many decisions. Also, the choices in The Witcher 2 do have an impact on the events of the game—a significant impact. A choice you make at the end of the first chapter completely changes your perspective on the second chapter. The quest line completely changes so you will want to play this game at least twice to get the full effect and, depending on how dedicated you are, maybe several more times.\n\nThe narrative plays out over a prologue, three chapters and an epilogue. The three chapters make up the bulk of the game and each is confined to a single location. There is no way to travel back to previous locations once the chapter concludes. This is a narrative driven game and it wants you to move forward. Many players used to games like those in The Elder Scrolls or Gothic series may be upset by this but the narrative so greatly benefits from this rigid structure that it's hard to make a case for a more open format. Each locale is loaded with side quests and very few of them feel like obnoxious chores; a problem that plagues many other RPG experiences. The sidequests mix in some character development, world building and humor generally enriching the core experience.\n\nThere are two very compelling reasons to do all of the sidequests in a location. The first is that resources in The Witcher 2 are very limited. Unlike most modern RPGs, you can't really grind for money. Reselling items, gear and raw materials nets such a small portion of the items original value that it's not worth doing for the sake of recouping your money. You will have to carefully decide what you can craft and what you should buy since simply buying the gear and items you want will quickly deplete your coiffures. The second reason to do all of those extra quests is to drink in the staggeringly beautiful world that The Witcher 2 offers. The Witcher 2 set a new graphical benchmark with its richly detailed and carefully crafted world. You really have to search hard for an ugly texture. Everything from the biggest building to the smallest environmental prop is detailed and rendered with care. One of the standout quests in the third chapter takes you to  a mage's laboratory that is filled with trinkets, equipment and murals. It's dimly lit, with sinister stones protruding from the walls. Acquiring new armor is rewarding even if the stats aren't a significant improvement over what you have just because the detail put into it is so fantastic. It's a shame that the facial animations don't quite match the graphical leap forward. They are not bad but they are decidedly current gen in a game that was ahead fo the graphical curve on release.\n\nCombat in The Witcher 2 has been massively overhauled from the first game. Geralt can lay traps, use rudimentary magics and is an accomplished swordsman. Even if you don't focus on leveling spell casting or using traps Geralt is still competent enough to make use of these abilities. Some will see the lack of opportunity to really build a Geralt to their personal style but it's as a consequence of the character's lore. You still place skill points in the appropriate trees to buff the abilities of your choice but you don't really spec into an archetypical fantasy class. When it comes to wielding his blades, Geralt has two swords, a silver blade for monsters and a steel blade for humans. He can parry and counter so timing your attacks in key. Certain traps are more effective for some enemies and magic is a mix of healing, buffing and attacking. It's quite a repertoire and you are left with no shortage of tactical options. Fortunately, a new tutorial was added to the Enhanced Edition to help players come to grips with Geralt's skills and abilities. One rather irritating quirk of the combat is the fact that Geralt can only use potions outside of battle so this can turn some encounters into a trial and error affair. You often have to fail in a battle to see what potions may be worth using. It never makes the game annoying... It just makes alchemy feel pointless. Combat requires some skill and forethought but shouldn't be too taxing to a competent gamer and generally proves rewarding.\n\nThe Witcher 2 was a great game with a few annoying flaws. The Enhanced Edition addresses many of these and goes above and beyond with meaningful new in game content. It's packed with new cutscenes and the new quests are some of the best in the game. The structure is rigid when compared to some other RPGs but it boasts a stronger, more direct narrative as a result. The ability to make choices in the game is enriching and adds tremendous replay value and the visuals look great three years after it's initial release. The combat is solid though the alchemy system is quirky to the point of being almost pointless. None of the flaws present will stay with you for long after you complete this game though. It's likely that you will be more concerned with what CDProjekt Red has in store for us in the next Witcher release.","February 19, 2014","true","2.2"," 170 of 205 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","170","205","0","1"

In so many ways. And I am not a person who likes change upon something I already loved so much like the first Witcher.\nI had to push through the incredibly difficult prologue, the different combat system which really disappointed me because I loved the time based sword combat in the first game, and the change from classical painting art style for cutscenes to comic art. I was really bitter about it. However, it all changed after the end of the prologue and the beginning of this incredibly complex story that had so much going on that I was really immresed in it. Moreover, the further you go in the game, the better it gets in terms of story, gameplay, graphics and art style, music, and EVERYTHING. This game wasn't really what I hated anymore, the story kept getting deeper and all pieces from the previous game and this one were coming together somehow. I found that despite all the differences between the first and second Witcher games, they still kept the core of what made The Witcher series what it is; a story about greedy, ugly human nature when politics, beliefs and money and thirst for power cause conflict. I completely fell in love with this game, and I can't wait for the third installment.","March 26, 2014","true","65.8"," 101 of 110 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","101","110","0","1"

It's developed by Polish company CD Projekt Red.\n\nWitcher games are about monster hunter called Geralt of Rivia, also known as Butcher of Blaviken. Geralt has two objectives during the game, to regain his lost memory and find the Witcher who slayed the king, while being accused of killing the king himself.\n\nThe main story is intriguing and full of surprises. It highly varies based on your decision in the end of first chapter. Second and third chapters have different locations, characters and story focus depenging on your path. This gives Witcher 2 great replayability since different plot points will be revealed. Just like the main questline, side quests offer the same thoughtful and witty writing. There's morally ambigious choices throughout the game and you never know when the consequences come back at you. But very often they will.\n\nThe negatives in the game would be the horrible Inventory system, it's a pain to navigate.No overwriting saves, so every save will be a new one and save folder can grow to even 5 gb. Too many saves also slows the launch menu and has been reported to sometimes even cause crashes. So I deleted my saves manually on occasion. I also wasn't a big fan of the combat changes. While the combat in first one was bit more tactical and rhythm based, now it feels a bit too button mashy. More tools to fight have been added though, like traps and throwing knives. I was also bothered that after killing an enemy, if there's another present, Geralt will automatically leap on the next one if you just keep on mashing the attack. Sometimes quite ridicilous distances.\n\nVoice acting is stellar and the music makes Geralt's journey feel even more epic. The game was gorgeous when it first came out. Still looks good even today, which makes it harder to run well on older machines. Personally I enjoyed the first game a bit more, because of the story and even the combat. Though most people will prefer the more action oriented combat of this sequel. Witcher 2 is one of the best modern RPG:s and highly recommended to anyone looking for a great mature fantasy world.\n\n[Score: 89]","December 11, 2015","true","32.4"," 91 of 101 people (90%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","90","91","101","10","5"

Geralt's journey will bring him to different cities, realms and areas and there are many things to do for our beloved white wolf. Sure it's no 'Open World'-game but the areas still offer huge spaces to explore - full of monsters, characters, hidden secrets and forgotten treasures. Besides the synchronisation is all the time on a high level (even in german!) and despite its age of over four years the graphics are still absolutely amazing.\n\nI've spent over  40 hours on my first run on hard mode but afterwards I instantly started a second one due to the fact that the choices you make can create completely different adventures and often questlines, areas and outcomes change entirely.

Some negative points would be that during the storyline the difficulty changes between 'Geralt is Superman' and 'everyone else is Superman' (which leads to some pretty annoying situations), the fighting system is just average (...and definitly not a very strong point of the game), I had several CTDs and unfortunately the saving system is kind of annoying, because every save creates a new seperate data and the more data the longer some loading periods will be. As a 'frequent-saver' I had to clean out a lot...\n__________________________________________\n__________________________________________\n\n...But this is complaining on an insanely high level and all in all I can say that this is one of my favourite RPGs.

And all this is backed up by one of the best protagonists of all time: the legendary White Wolf, Geralt of Rivia.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/suspectfenster/recommended/20920/","suspectfenster","fenster","http://steamcommunity.com/id/suspectfenster/","150 products in account","The Witcher 2 is a narrative driven action RPG by Polish developers CD Projekt Red. To be reductive, it contains a lot of action-like RPG combat and deep mechanics common to Bethesda games, but is also extremely narrative driven to the tune of something Bioware might put out.  Over the course of the game, much of the Witcher's many turning gears become an immensely enjoyable machine, though it jumps to a rough start and could use a more enjoyable combat system.  I did play with the Combat Rebalance mod, which allegedly makes the combat better; truly I think it just made it more trivial, but those may be two sides of the same coin in this case.\n\nI started Witcher 2 having never played the Witcher 1, and generally not knowing what the game was about or how it worked.  Let me be blunt -- that is the absolute worst way to start the Witcher 2.  The game does offer an overall useless tutorial (if you have the Enhanced Edition), but otherwise it throws you right into a pretty hot mess.  Very little is explained in the way of combat mechanics, the many systems at your control (things like potions, crafting, magic abilities), and the context of the warring monarchs and their mysterious assassin which are central to its plotline.  Overall, it’s a little daunting to start.  That said, I highly recommend you persevere; lying on the other side is a huge payoff.\n\nWhat makes Witcher 2 shine is the well crafted, incredibly epic story of politicking and sorcery.  What’s even more impressive is the dynamic way in which it is presented to you; very few games give you the sense of control over the story the way Witcher does.  The game is divided into 3 acts, and the second act can be completely different based on decisions you make in the first act.  You will start in a different location, have different characters to interact with, and different quests.  Even more impressive is that Witcher 2 does a good job of staying away from the typical good/bad archetypes; characters usually feel complex and your decisions almost always fall into a gray area.  It never feels like the game is pushing you one direction or the other; sometimes being the bad guy pays off...other times, not so much.\n\nThe plot itself is very interesting, though you won’t find anything revolutionary about it.  Voice acting is typically well done, which is good because there is a LOT of it.  At least half the game can easily be spent talking to characters and fleshing out the world in which Witcher 2 takes place.  Cutscenes are serviceable, but nothing extraordinary.  Like many games of this scope, much of the Witcher 2 lacks a certain polish -- the game certainly looks beautiful, but animations are often clunky and transitions are not done well.\n\nLacking the most polish, certainly, is the combat.  Combat in Witcher 2 feels mostly like a buffer between unlocking more of the story.  With the Combat Rebalance mod, parrying is automatic and after some initial struggle, I quickly learned to spam the same ability over and over again, accented by mashing attack and rolling around.  I easily beat 95% of encounters this way.  While you have a lot of options in terms of equipment etc., the majority is useless or unnecessary and I would have liked a little more variety in loot and spells.  I wouldn’t say the combat is outright bad, but it is certainly mediocre and not the highlight here.\n\nOverall, while there is a lot to nitpick about Witcher 2, I highly enjoyed it.  It’s a beautiful game which offers up one of the most interesting stories you can find in the medium.  Decisions are impactful and rewarding, even if combat is not.  If you like Skyrim, or Mass Effect, and wish there was a game which blended the two together into a great PC game, look no further than Witcher 2.","October 13, 2014","true","33.6"," 72 of 81 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","72","81","0","0"

Prostitution. Violence. Loyalty. Espionage. Racism. If somebody tells you that Witcher 2 is for mature audiences, this isn’t because it’s exceptionally bloody or gory for a title of its genre – it’s because of the world and stories that it presents.\n\nIt’s true: the graphics are mostly really good, even stunning in places. Battle is tactical and you have to learn how to use both your weaponry and your magic abilities in order to succeed. Music and sound are pretty good - the nice use of different dialects is a good reason that you should consider playing it in English even if that’s not your native language. The flaws that actually bothered me were few - like the fact that Geralt (your character) puts up the same facial expression for 80% of his dialogue.\n\nYet it’s the storytelling and the way you shape WHAT story unfolds that I enjoyed most.\nGeralt has a real talent to end up as the “right guy in the wrong place”. And even though he progresses through the quests for pretty personal reasons, he constantly finds himself forced to make decisions that have a much larger impact than his personal fate.  Who will you trust? Who will you help? By the time you finish the first chapter you will have made decisions that will not only control the way you experience the rest of the story, but also will shape the lifes of many of the characters you met and – in the end – maybe even the rise and the fall of the nations that you cross. As usual in the Witcher games, you will find that not all of your decisions have the effect that you hoped, and often you only can try to choose the lesser evil.\n\nWhen I finished the game I felt the urge to play the Witcher 3  (which isn’t released at the time of this writing). Not because of the (hopefully) good gameplay and graphics that I expect – but because I wonder where Geralt's personal story and the big events that happen around him will finally lead.\n\nSo do yourself a favor, get past the crappy tutorial and average prologue and then – starting with the first chapter - play one of the finest RPGs that are out there.","August 17, 2014","true","68.7"," 60 of 65 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","60","65","0","5"

The series are pinnacle of RPG gaming, and developers really tried to present the best RPG experience to the gamers, and, I dare to say, they succeeded.\n\nThe story of Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings takes place after the first game. Someone blamed you for murdering a King, and you set off to find out the culprit. Simple as that, but, the story is also about Geralt regaining his memories.\n\nThe graphics are quite good and enchanted in relation to the first Witcher game. Attentions to the small things are amazing, from the detailed characters and environments to special effects, and Witcher is a truly an eye candy for gaming masses. In regard to that, you really need a high end PC machine to play the Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings.\n\nThe world of Witcher is huge and along the way you will meet a bunch of interesting characters, have a lot of...virtual sex, fight many kind of monsters, etc. Sometimes the game feels a bit to grindy, but your choices and fights you are engaging yourself into really impact the outcome of the story. Sometimes the battles seem a bit to tough, and RPG beginners could find the game more challenging, but, once you gain enough experience under your belt, the battles become easier.\n\nAll Witcher games are highly recommended, and this one is no exception.

The combat system is much more fluid, allowing spectacular kill-streaks, and the game is pretty fun to play even with a gamepad (but navigating the inventory with it is kinda frustrating). Graphics-wise the game is just wonderful, it seems impossible that it was released in 2011. The story is compelling and full of humour, intrigues and plot twists, and since you'll have to choose between two possible paths at the end of Act I, you need AT LEAST two different playthroughs to explore all the content (but to really see everything you'll probably need to reload your savegame at least 4 or 5 times in certain situations).\n\nI cannot think about a single reason not to try this game, especially if you're a RPG aficionado. They're pretty cheap (Summer sale is about to start and I guess you can buy both games for around 6 or 7 euros) and they're absolutely awesome. Plus, you'll support CD Projekt RED, a GREAT developer that will also give you a DRM Free copy on GOG if you enter your Steam Key on their website.\n\nTry The Witcher Saga.

The company is offering free DLCS and long term support and also made the game no DRM. Which means there is no negative effect on performance due to protection.\n\nChoices Matter\nThe game itself has excellent story telling elements. Alongside the fact that every mission you do effects the outcome of you're stories which can result to 16 different endings makes this game have alot of replay value.\n\nGameplay\nThe gameplay however is a deep learning curve. Anyone who hasn't played the witcher 1 prepare for a bit of dieing. The basic idea is that you use steel sword against humans, and silver against monsters. They took a odd approach in making you need to drink potions before combat in order to use them to your advantage. I found this a very huge turn in how difficult a rpg can be. Generally in other rpgs like Skyrim for example you had the handicap of being able to pause the game and drink some HP or mana potions. In this game you need to really know what your doing and what your about to fight in trial and error to prepare well.\n\nMini-Games\nThe game has a few mini-games that really add to the overall experience (Brawls,Gambling). The dice games and brawls have their own narrative in which you will get certain items or information you otherwise might not have obtained and has some-what importance though they are not vital to the overall experience.\n\nGraphics\nThe graphics are constantly compared to Crysis. While it might not have better graphics tech wise. Many agree its artistic value is far superior to that of Crysis.\n\nConclusion\nOverall the witcher 2 is a great game that I would recommend anyone who is already into fantasy RPGs and is looking for another solid game to play with good story elements.","November 26, 2013","true","242.1"," 46 of 56 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","46","56","0","0"

Following clues, finding key people and killing monsters will be the foundations for this new quest for the Witcher. More and complicated political issues and alliances are part of the story this time, as we have to take sides, each side leading to new missions and characters.\n\nGameplay\nThe Witcher 2 is a totally different game if we compare it to the original title, controls have been changed making gameplay more difficult to get used to, as we must learn how to use every new control and key. Bombs, traps and daggers were incorporated to make gameplay more varied, we still have the use of signs and our well-known steel and silver swords.\n\nOn this occasion, signs feel more significant, they have a different touch, this time signs make you feel they are important to use depending on the battle we are having or the danger we are facing, they are concise and powerful to use, they deliver powerful blows and do a great deal of damage, even more if you level up the power and use of stamina.\n\nBombs, traps and daggers are a great new addition, but in my case, I stuck only to bombs as they are more reliable and have more variation, poisonous, shrapnel, explosive, you name it, we have many different bombs for different situations, they are created the same way potions are created, by meditating, just get the right ingredients and the formula and you are all set.\n\nThe new system includes quickslots, very helpful in fighting situations, here you can select which kind of secondary attack you wish to use, bombs, traps and daggers are the only options.\n\nMeditating is still tactical, as you may know, the witcher games are not the typical hack ‘n’ slash game, before going into any battle against monsters or humans, meditating is important and a must for you have to drink the right potion and brew what you need for battle, this characteristic has been improved as well, we no longer need a fire to meditate, just any place with no danger around will suffice. Leveling up will give us points we can spent on the skill tree where we have four paths, each of these paths have multiple options we can improve, so choosing correctly is up to you.\n\nDepending on the development of your skill tree Geralt will start showing more fighting moves, the power of signs will increase, toxicity tolerance will improve and also a new addition has been introduced, the adrenaline rush, a perk that will deliver a killing move as an in-game cinematic.\n\nTW2 offers more variety regarding armors and swords, the previous title was very limited and the creation of new swords was narrowed to some few silver and steel swords, even worst for armor sets, here we get to find new and better armor sets with many different perks and characteristics, the same for swords, blacksmiths are more common and ingredients for the creation of new tools are plentiful.\n\nGraphics\nTW2 is a beautiful game, it is a gigantic step taken if we compare it to the original witcher, gameplay changed so did graphics and effects, it feels smoother and more defined. While the graphics are one of a kind here, the game also offers a great detail in weather effects and it adds a more consistency regarding the climate as well as day and night cycles. The engine really shines every time many of these aspects interact whether in battle or just when searching for clues related to any of the many missions and side-quests. There are little details in all sort of vegetation, the skies show multiple effects depending on the levels and sometimes in the distance the firmament is shown full of stars. More importantly, the engine is very keen to show off the diversity in the main cities we visit. Especially Upper Aedirn, a fantastic city built by dwarves, every stone, from a little stone to the biggest of the constructions the city is of a great design, it really captures the atmosphere of a place that has seen countless battles, magnificent.\n\nSound and voices\nThe series has always been very serious regarding sound and voice acting, and this time is not an exception, voice actors did a great job on every aspect of the acting, characters are believable and demonstrate different kind of accents during the story, we even get to listen to more of the elves’ language, superb work, nothing negative here.\n\nAs for sound, TW2 is solid, we can feel the atmosphere on any landscape’s sound, nature, monsters etc. Everything is unique and deserves attention while the music adds intention and action to every battle, mission and interaction. Outstanding.\n\nThe bad but not serious\nPerhaps what makes this game difficult to get used to it’s the amount of characters, their personal views, politics and different story lines and past events that make the lore of the witcher a deep abyss of details, it might be complicated for people not familiar with the books, at least, on my first play through, I felt lost in the middle of the politics, unlike the original witcher, TW2 shows a more mature and adult view of the world. I would mention not to pick this one without a little bit of knowledge related to the lore, I strongly recommend the books to get a better insight of the witcher world and politics, after that, the series starts to be easier to understand and at the same time it helps appreciate even more the different aspects of the game, the kingdoms, lands and peoples, wars and history.\n\nConclusion\nAs I said before, The Witcher 2 is a more mature game, a more adult-oriented title that will not disappoint at all, it has the depth regarding stories and lore, and it shows a more complex game style, definitely a must for RPG lovers and fans of the books.","May 11","true","71.1"," 33 of 37 people (89%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","89","33","37","4","0"

(Even when you spent 50 hours to do all the side quests and trying to read in-game books, chat with NPCs and trying to get much info about in-game world as possible)\n\nWhen you playing the game second time - just curious what happen if you change your choices and play style (harder difficulty, different skill tree) - you would stay stunned like "HOLY ♥♥♥♥! There are so much possibilities, characters, events, new unexplored areas, new quests, connections, consequences and points of views I could not even imagine on first time play."  There it comes the moment you start really realize what have you trully done, changed, and to whom you probably helped on the first play. (In game there are lots of shady characters and you can never be sure of their goal and side when you just look at them from one point of view). Obviously the second play results in decision, that you have to play that game at least one more time.\n\nTo deeper understanding the story I really recommend to read all Witcher books from Andrzej Sapkowski which are events before Witcher games. And in Witcher 2 you would need those information much more then in Witcher 1 (one could say that you really dont need to know much about books in W1) to get full understanding about what is really going on. And what is finaly going to happen in W3 Wild Hunt.\n\nThe impact of your choices to the game characters, lands and whole word order is HUGE and will probably means a LOT in grand finale in Witcher 3 so far as I can see and will be very interesting to see how they change the next episode. Thus I reccomend you to keep your final saves from Witcher 2 to import them to Witcher 3. (I heard that steam cloud only stores last 100 saves. I have about 250 saves on 1 ending, which means you are not able to keep all your endings in cloud after uninstaling. Keep that in mind)\n\nSummary:\n+ Great story continuation of Witcher books by Sapkowski\n+ make your choices and face their consequences\n+ singleplayer you can and should play more then once (multiple endings)\n+ choices and results imported from Witcher 1 and to Witcher 3\n+ shady fantasy world in its real nature (nothing is black and white)\n+ amazing graphic world\n+ nice cinematic scenes\n+ nice soundtrack\n+ swordmanship, magic and potions\n\n- too much saves results in crashing (you need to clean up your old saves in folder from time to time)\n- players thad didnt read books could be a bit lost in plot and could miss much important things (but still could enjoy the playing :p)\n- playing on the highest difficulty is both: incredible easy (most of the time) and almost impossible (on specific event when you lack some specific skill - "riposte/position/feet work" seems like Holy Trinity to surviving - which result in "hours" of reloading trying to beat the game with different skill tree. Simply boring and makes you angry. Especially without riposte it takes much much much more longer and its very hard to survive when you controll ghost soldiers in ghost battle (it seems that this is the only skill that is usable in that fight and your increased vigor - not through potions though - all other stats, improvements, and skills you choose are not applicable in that part of the game making this one skill like a must-win / must-lose-hard choice. Yeah it is possible even without it if you have the nerves and time ;) I did.

I liked the way you had to think about things a lot more, use more strategy in battle, use all the signs, traps and bombs, not just Aard/coup-de-grace everything in sight. The quests are also more complicated, they are no longer WoW-style kill 20 things/collect 20 things quests, they almost all have multiple ways to resolve them and some of the possible ways require you to find out things the game doesn't automatically tell you about. Even shopping is more complicated, there is a crafting system with templates to buy, and money is often scarce. A lot of potions have drawbacks and levelling up involves a more detailed skill tree. I enjoyed the return of the poker dice quest, as well as Geralt's adventures in arm-wrestling and prize-fighting.\n\n\nI would recommend playing it, as it has a good story, good music and satisfying gameplay, the most important things in an RPG for me, I have a few complaints:\n\nThe game sometimes hangs for no discernable reason (I am using a fairly high-end Windows 8.1 laptop), which the first game also did.\n\nThe 'mature' aspects of the game are getting more tacky. I quite liked the erotic artwork and occasionally bizarre implied sexual tastes of the first game, but they've been replaced by the same incredibly repetitive cut scene that leaves virtually nothing to the imagination. Even when Geralt meets the succubus, there's nothing particularly remarkable about his amorous adventures. Also, ALL the NPCs make ribald jokes and swear for no particular reason ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE GAME. And, inevitably, there are lesbians for humorous effect. It feels kind of immature, not mature. The level of explicit violence is also getting more needlessly extreme and gratuitous. and the cut scenes in the strange animated style faintly annoy me.\n\nThe story still feels unresolved, as the problems you solve mostly come back as soon your back is turned, which gets my mood a little low. Geralt doesn't seem to really have much effect on the wider story of the world, he just solves his own personal storyline, mostly getting his memory back. Everyone is still at war, everything is still a damn mess. It's like a tabletop game where the GM won't let you actually change his beloved world. The growing Wild Hunt theme is the most interesting part of the story that seems to actually concern you, and the third Witcher game is called Wild Hunt, so maybe the plot will actually get somewhere next game?","November 28, 2014","true","44.5"," 46 of 60 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","46","60","0","1"

First of all I hope you understand my position and dont downvote just because of a fanboy impulse. Thanks for reading. I tried I REALLY REALLY tried to like this game but I just can't (look at my play time, no joking around or justifying over false basis). The story, graphics and music are awesome but the combat mechanics and the insane amount of walking around with a robotic-like animation kills it. I've even tried to play it again with the full combat rebalance mod but... the mechanic itself its soooo broken that I just can't like it. I feel like I have little to no control over Geralt or combat in general for many reasons:\n\n- The awful auto targeting mechanic... Anybody would expect presing a key or pushing the stick towards a specific direction and hit the strike button and see your character attack in that direction but no... Geralt attacks the character that he is auto targetting. I've died SO many times because of that. Trying to cast an Igni sign to the front and seeing Geralt turn around and cast it on another direction is priceless... The same goes with sword attacks. I really felt like I had more control on the witcher 1 and that is saying A LOT.\n\n-Animations are confusing and illogical. Sometimes I hit an enemy and it doesn't count as a hit because the did an evade movement (even though the sword actually FULLY touched them). I thought ok then the same goes for me right? NOPE. On your evade/roll animation, if you get  touched, you are hit... Then sometimes the enemies appear to be stun locked and you think YEAH I can keep hitting them. NOPE. They magically recover from the middle of a "stun" animation in the middle of your next swing and OWN YOU (on higher difficulties). You really can never tell when its safe to keep slashing or back away so the game becomes a slash roll away, slash, roll away, repeat and pray that your next slash doesnt get "magically evaded" and your foe attacks you in a second of invincibility...\n\n-Attack animations are not in your control, sometimes the animation is "cooler" but it takes longer to land a hit and you never know when will what animation appear so you are basically F-ed since you can plan your attacks so well. Theres no pattern the animations are random, no combos.\n\n-You cant block while you walk, yes you read right, YOU CANT.\n\n-Did I mention the walking? You have to walk too much, the backgrounds look nice but will get old and boring once you complete the monster hunt missions and get an empty area.\n\n-Parry+Riposte mechanic is broken. Sometimes you get the symbol to do it and even though the parry animation shows and you block the hit and actually execute the attack, the enemy sometimes keeps attacking you and OWN YOU since you are in the middle of a swing, defenseless.\n\n-You cant drink potions in the middle of a fight and it gets annoying if you sum the time it takes for geralt to sit down, open the menu, make the potion, drink the potion, then stand up.\n\n-At some point you'll find out that you can beat the game spamming Igni signs.\n\nAnd the cherry on top of the cake of the cake: the game doesn't run so well. Witcher 3 and Gorund Zeroes run much better than this game, and that's a shame :( The game autosaves a lot and dont erase the much older saves. There are so many saves that on one point the load game screen starts to need a considerable amount of seconds to even show up. Sometime it just crashes and brings down Steam too (I have to end the process and restart steam).\n\nSum up: Personally I think this game its a step in the right direction but it didn't reach the goal as it was supposed to. Thankfully the witcher 3 fixed every detail I'm complaining about. Even though it still shares the auto target function it lets you back away from the middle of a possible suicide attack by letting you cancel it through rolling or evading. The monsters' health bar blinks when they are about to attack, potions during combat and quick navigation through menus are back, etc. That game is what this one was supposed to be, but died trying.\n\nI reapeat: I hope you understand my position and dont downvote just because of a fanboy impulse.

And I can safely say I am pleased with this game. This game has the perefct balance between story, gameplay, and game lenght. There's quite a bit of dialog, but if you dont like it, you can just skip the talking.\n\nThis is a rpg game for adults. There's politics, ethical problems, and a bunch of hard choises to make. I spent about 35 hours, and I did almost everything the game has to offer. There's an arena mode wich does not have anything to do with the story of the game, where you fight against increasingly hard waves of enemies, wich game me an hour of enjoyment, but you can play it for quite a bit.\n\nIn summary, this is one of the best games I have played. The story is amazing, and i was caught in the situations of the game at all times. I was suprised when the game was finished, since I didn't feel time flowing. The gameplay is an HUGE upgrade from the last one, and skill is a bigger factor than stats. The lore and immersion is fantastisc, i actually went through all the books i found. It altso looks amazing, still, in 2016.\n\nThis one is among the best games I have played, and it deserves a 10/10. Now, I'm starting the third, and probably the last game in the series.

It's a game that I am still thinking of once in a while even years after I beat it. It's a game, although with limited amount of NPC (even the enhanced version) and some minor issues, that will stand the test of time. It's a game, whose soundtrack I am still listening to. It's a game whose folklore still captivates me with its creativity and versatility.\n\nThe art direction in this game is bound to get some awards at the end of the year. It is perplexing just to look at the distant vistas that are missing from so many games. The first Witcher pulled that off on occasion. Such areas as The Lake provided you with the feeling like you were in a big world even though you were confined to an average-size area. Witcher 2 takes this to another level. Not only do you get to enjoy the distant cascading vistas that are staggered by layers and layers of the nearby and the faraway horizons, you also get to enjoy the near environments teeming with life. Yes, we have seen some impressive NPC behavior in the past but this time, the behavior of some of the NPC is near unpredictable. And don't expect them to stand around this time and have same faces.\n\nThe game features extremely well written dialogue with plenty of words that I had to look up. The story arches in many different directions depending on your actions or inactions. This is a very very mature game.\n\nI was able to import my last saves from the first game - which supposedly influences some of the dialogue between the characters. Some of the events are also going to be influenced, supposedly...\n\nThe long loading times when you enter a new area or even a small house are gone now. Also, if you walk inside someone's premises, you will be amazed by the attention to detail. They devs haven't missed anything on this one.\n\nIn general, Witcher 2 instantly sucks you in with its immense ambience. I cannot even begin to describe the feelings I had when I was walking through the forest for the first time. Sometimes I find myself standing still in the forest and attempting to look as far as I can and behind every tree you can see another tree and so on...I have never seen anything like it. I also love the background blur.\n\nDo not expect this game to be easy though. It is pretty hard. The combat system takes a while to get used to. You will have to time your attacks with almost near precision. Not only that, you will have to combine your regular attacks with your special attacks to cause the maximum amount of damage. The battle system in the first game was sort of a war of attrition. You would usually be surrounded by enemies and you'd have to quickly switch in between your fighting moves to finish everyone off before you yourself died. It will probably take you a while to be able to come out of the fights near-unscathed. So at first you will most likely die and die and die.\n\nThe game however, gives you plenty of opportunity to roam around and collect herbs before you get into doing heavy quests. In most RPG's, there is no indication of how hard one or another quest is going to be. But we always assume that we will be able to complete it. This game does not let you do that.\n\nAnd unlike the first game that heavily required the use of potions on the Hardest mode, this game require the use of potions on the Medium mode. This time, you really have to look for those ingredients.\n\nThe ironic thing is that even if you are able to stuff your pockets with the ingredients, you still only know the very basic alchemy at the beginning of the game. So using the temporary oils that will temporarily enhance your melee attacks is essential.\n\nQuests. Ok, do you remember all those silly fetching quests in Dragon Age 2 that take place on the same areas over and over again? Now you can forget about all that. I cannot believe that the writers of these games still haven't run out of original ideas for the secondary quests.\n\nI am also happy to see some of the Witcher 1 monsters coming back. Not to mention the fact that they look better and move more realistically.\n\nJust like with the first game, there is this dichotomy present within human interactions. On one hand, you are the monster slayer, but you are not necessarily the protector of the people. So do not expect to always find sympathizers and allies within the immediate human communities. The racial tensions are still here too and there's plenty of vulgarity to go around.\n\nThe soundtrack is perfect. Does anyone remember "Peaceful Moments" from the first game? You'll hear plenty of that here.\nThere are also easter eggs pertaining to Assassin's Creed and to the Lord of the Rings.\n\nAnyways, I never gave any game a "10", but this game truly deserves it. I really cannot see much wrong with it and I've been playing it since midnight. One thing that is annoying is the disappearing bodies and the ability to loot people's homes without any repercussion. In addition, you really DO have to think ahead and anticipate the movement of your foes.\n\nAll in all, I got myself a collector's edition. If anyone can afford to get it, please get it - the devs need our support. I won't hesitate to say that this is the most beautiful game ever created, so far; and so far it is my favorite game of all time, until the Witcher 3, of course...\n\nI am also happy to boast that on May 13, 2013 after approximately 170 hours of trying I was able to beat the game on Insane difficulty (as in beating the game with permadeath difficulty).","November 27, 2013","true","271.1"," 43 of 58 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","43","58","0","5"

The game has many redeeming features which shall be discussed shortly, however I feel as though there are just as many aspects that make the player underwhelmed with his/her experience. Secondly, I should say that this review builds upon my review of the original Witcher, which I have also reviewed on Steam, so I will be making a few comparative points in light of my disposition toward the first instalment in the series.\n\nThe Witcher 2 is driven extremely well by an engrossing narrative of political intrigue, racial prejudice and social injustice. Although the hybrid of Medieval and fantasy themes has been done before and is far from original, The Witcher 2 fully embraces the combination and creates a three-dimensional world with rounded and well thought-out characters that have their own individual agendas and follow them accordingly. There are a few plot twists along the way which I, of course, won’t mention, but these keep the narrative feeling fresh and engaging enough to continue playing til the end. I would say that the story, fresh from the pages of the original comics, is the main factor encouraging gamers to try this game.\n\nFurthermore, we aren’t babysat. Nothing has been toned or dumbed down, which is preferable as too few games are made in modern times that have been made for an adult audience. We are shoehorned immediately into the action and I think that’s why the game puts many people off in the initial stages, claiming it to be unfriendly to new users to the series. I would argue this is a commendable feature however, as the harsh and merciless world of Geralt is directly reflected in the games content and contextual features.\n\nThe combat is far more engaging than in the original WItcher, due simply to it being more enjoyable. That being said, it is far from perfect. Battles range from being far too easy to far too hard far too quickly. We can quickly descend into the ‘trial and error’ form of gaming, constantly reloading previous saves in order to trial new ways of beating a difficult enemy. You can also only drink or create potions before a battle, not during it, which is more realistic I accept, but ultimately make many aspects of the combat frustrating. If I realise that a potion improving my vigor regeneration will help me win a battle in its opening stages, why not just let me drink one? The guise of this being ‘unrealistic’ simply makes alchemy and potion consumption frustrating; constantly saving, reloading and drinking potions before a known fight drastically effect the pace of the game and cause a stuttering experience that is cause for concern.\n\nPerhaps the most disappointing characteristic of The Witcher 2 though is the world itself. I don’t mean its concept, I mean in its literal physicality. The areas you can explore are minuscule in terms of a 21st century RPG and the areas are quickly covered and recovered time and again. This makes the quests fairly limited, as there is only so much to do in a rather small gaming arena. Quests such as competing at arm wrestling, dice poker and brawling are irrelevant sideshows, yet if you take  these out you are only left with half dozen side quests in Act I and II respectively, and only a couple in the rather brief Act III. The overall longevity of the game is actually rather small, with a completed game taking between 16-30 hours (and that would be being generous). Essentially, there are a fair number of things to do in the world, but there really aren’t that many, certainly not deserving of high merit.\n\nQuest exploration (in terms of the map and quest markers) is a rather touchy subject for both fans and haters of the series alike. Fans of this game state that the map and quest hints are intentionally cryptic because the game encourages you to explore yourself, and that we shouldn’t be spoon fed as gamers. Haters of The Witcher 2 point on the map and quest markers are totally useless, broken, and ruin the gaming experience completely. While I totally back the formers idea in theory, in practice the latter is nearer the truth. Quest markers as you approach them do sometimes teleport elsewhere without explanation, whilst the game map has no concept of ‘levels’, meaning that you may arrive at your destination only to discover that its several floors above you, a particular problem in Vergen. If the developers didn’t want to spoon feed the gamer and it was all about exploration and realism, why bother with a quest marker at all? Why, at the beginning of the majority of quests, does it tell us where to go? The quest exploration in the game seems to be a halfway house between attempting to help the gamer and encourage exploration, yet it ends up failing on both counts.\n\nA problem with the critiques of the Witcher are of course, the critics themselves. Haters of the series have complained of a lack of fast travel. There is of course, no problem with that whatsoever. The developers have created a game that is very graphically impressive with some engaging characters, all of which they want you to experience. Removing fast travel will enhance the possibility of experiencing these things. Furthermore, the confines of the world itself is rather tiny meaning that fast travel is, for the large part, totally unnecessary anyway, as it does not take particularly long to run from one side of the map to the other.\n\nOne of my main bones of contention with the previous Witcher instalment was its ‘mature’ content. I stated in my review of that game that having maturity in the game does not make the game mature, and I think that unfortunately still applies to the sequel. I’m not sure if it’s because the translations from Polish to English are not clear enough, but much of the dialogue feels awkward, with characters using expletives, talking of ♥♥♥♥ and ‘ploughing’ for the sake of it. I think the developers could have included this content without making it so blasé, and it still seems as though the developers are trying to show off to kids and young teens. Nearly all dialogue refers to some obscenity and it becomes tiresome rather quickly. In fact, many of the characters are unlikeable because of this fact, most noticeably Roache and Ioveth. This does help serve the ‘shades of grey’ approach that the developers are going for, using a ‘lesser of two evils’ mindset, yet it is hard to play out an entire game without at least having a couple of likeable characters that we wish to associate with.  A positive note however, is that the ‘Sex Cards’ from the previous game have been removed, presumably because those who were amused or aroused by such content hit puberty and discovered internet porn.\n\nOverall, the experience is okay and the narrative really is interesting. But the content of the game, although acceptable, really is not the experience that many exaggerated reviews on Steam that lavish the praise make out that it is. It has many issues that make it fall down. However, I would say that the commercial success of The Witcher 2 should allow the developers the funds to make The Witcher 3 into something special, reflecting an intriguing and exceptional storyline with equally impressive gaming content (for a change).\n\nPlease review and comment, any feedback is welcome and thank you for reading.","February 9, 2014","false","21.9"," 462 of 795 people (58%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","58","462","795","4","78"

I initally had a hard time getting into it, as I found it was harder than most rpg's that I play ( I'm a big fan of Dark Souls and Demon's Souls, though the Witcher 2 difficulty is different from those kinds of games. )  I also found it akward to play with a keyboard, and once I switched to a controller, my gameplay satisfaction significantly increased.  Once I got through the first chapter, I hit my stride then and figured out how to be a more effective Witcher, and the initial learning curve was overcome.  Gameplay is good, coupled with really good fighting animations, proves for a satisfying experience. Graphics and audio are very well done; the game has a satisfying and fitting soundtrack.  The story is interesting, and I always felt compelled to find out what happens next.  However it does allude to the first game quite a bit, and while it does fill in some details for you, it may be better to play through the first  game, but in my opinion it is not absolutely necessary.  The game also features multiple meaningful choices and there are several endings to obtain, giving alot more playabilty. All in all I would highly recommend it.","December 30, 2014","true","27.5"," 22 of 26 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","22","26","0","0"

Geralt is a witcher, a ghost-haired mutant that can wield swords and magical powers to dispatch foes. Expect a large cast of characters to interact with, plenty of ways to upgrade and customize Geralt to suit your play style, and at least one boss fight against a giant tentacle beast.\n\nFrom what's been said about the game so far, The Witcher 2 is enormous. The official word is 38 hours long, though it's unclear how much that may vary if you decide to take part in all the side quests and minigames. Like in the first game, your actions while playing affect what happens later. In the sequel, this may mean you'll miss entire towns (as well as the associated storylines and side quests) on your first playthrough. According to the game's official site there'll be four different beginnings and 16 possible endings.\n\n\nCOMBAT SYSTEM\nCombat has also received a significant overhaul. Gone is the restrictive timing-based system used in the original, replaced by a more free-form system that should be more familiar to those who play third-person action games. You'll be able to equip lots of different armor pieces this time, as well use weapons, spells and alchemical components to kill your enemies.\n\nIt's best to use Geralt's steel blade against humanoids and the silver one for monsters. Geralt's active target is painted with an icon, letting you know who you'll strike with an attack.\n\nThe most important thing to be mindful of in combat is your command wheel, which can be brought up by holding the Ctrl key. Bringing this up slows time and allows you to select one of Geralt's magical signs, as well as switch between combat items. Using the magical signs is a must. Even before they're powered up through leveling, these abilities can set enemies on fire (Igni), stun and root them in place (opportunity to perform finishing kill), knock them down and a temporarily dampen incoming damage (Aard), shield (Quen), trap to immobilize enemies (Yrden) and triggers a hex that causes an enemy to fight alongside with us (Axii).  Axii is my favorite sign while fighting with group opponent. Hexing them to fight along your side will reduce their enforcement pressure towards us when they are tightening their fight.\n\n\nPERFORMANCE\nThe Witcher 2 looks great. Only hours in you'll be treated to stunning views of enormous, sweeping vistas from the side of a castle under siege. Nearly every scene is populated with plenty of characters; the animations are more realistic than the first Witcher game during conversations and combat. Contrast lighting and warm color tone really brings up Witcher 2 among the best-looking games in existence - only the facial animation is imperfect. Background music and sound effect suit the atmosphere so much plus good voice acting supports a charismatic script really brings up Witcher 2 as a whole fantastic game.\n\nACCESSIBILITY\nApproaching a sequel to a dense role-playing game can be daunting. If you never played the first, The Witcher 2 stars an established character you may know nothing about and is set in a detailed fictional world you're likely not familiar. Why bother playing if you're not already invested in the story and characters?\n\nSo far, a number of reasons The Witcher 2 feels like a older style of role-playing epic: a rich, detailed experience packed with curiosities, creative and flexible quest designs, powerful reasons to explore and deep gameplay mechanics. And, as a bonus, it's much prettier than its predecessor.\n\nWitcher fans that played all the way through the first game are definitely getting something extra here. For you there's an existing emotional bond with some of the characters. When Triss and Geralt walk across the screen and reference past events and the names of lands and cities, there's an added layer of meaning.\n\nIf you didn't play The Witcher you'll be missing out on context, but it won't be long until you're caught up in the pressing drama of the sequel. I certainly wouldn't say you should wait to play The Witcher 2 until you've completed the first game. Due to a number of changes, mostly for convenience's sake, The Witcher 2 for now appears to be the better game. There's a definite learning curve when it comes to things like combat, managing the numerous menus and brewing and using potions, but it doesn't take long for it to make sense.\n\n\nCHOICE AND CONSEQUENCE\nSome role-playing games present choice and consequence in very clear terms. Sometimes you're given points for being good and evil. Your overall moral standing is displayed as a giant glowing meter on your character statistics page. All your decisions are distilled into one numerical value. Sometimes your appearance changes and characters react differently to your presence. The aim of all this is the make your decisions feel like they're having an impact in the world, that the virtual people you're helping or terrorizing remember your actions and, as a result, feel a little bit more human.\n\nIn The Witcher 2, there's no meter for good and evil. Instead, Geralt operates outside the reach of a persistent morality rating. During a quest Geralt can choose to help out or tell people to get lost in blunt, explicit terms. The results aren't as simple as unlocking a few extra dialogue options. Instead, there are significant changes to the direction of the quests.\n\nIn The Witcher 2, choice is not an illusion. At no point has this been more obvious than how the story develops toward the end of the first Chapter. A decision needs to be made about how to proceed forward, and the impact will radically change how things evolve. It determines the next city you visit, the cast of characters you follow and the quests made available. It changes your entire perspective on the main events of the game.\n\n\nCRAFTING AND ALCHEMY\nThough the core sword-slashing combat of The Witcher 2 might strike you as straightforward – time mouse clicks to string together slices – there are a lot of ways to modify Geralt's effectiveness in battle. One of the best ways to secure upgrades is through crafting. Most of everything that can be used and equipped in The Witcher 2 can be crafted. You can make traps, steel and silver swords, armor and even crafting components. When you have the appropriate Diagram, usually purchased from vendors, you need to go talk to crafter NPCs standing around in town. By interacting with them a crafting menu can be called up that displays all your Diagrams as well as whether or not you have the proper components. If you do, then after a simple button press the item is generated. There's no percentage chance to fail and there's no associated mini-game.\n\nThe value and function of potions in The Witcher 2 differs from fantasy role-playing game standards. You can't consume health restoration potions mid-battle in this game. Instead, you need to drink them before a fight begins, which gives Geralt temporary boosts to things like damage and health regeneration. It's a great system because it means you can't run into a conflict without thinking.\n\nMaking potions is similar to crafting gear. Vendors sell Formulas for potions, and by combining the appropriate plants special brews are created. The actual process of creation isn't handled by a vendor, but instead accessible through Geralt's mediation menu. Here you'll find listed all your Formulas for potions, bombs and oils. If the proper ingredients are in your inventory, the product can be outputted with a keystroke. Simple enough.\n\n\nREPLAYABILITY\nOf course, if you have dozens of times. The Witcher 2 has four different beginnings and 16 possible endings. Enjoy !\n\n\nVERDICT\n8.5/10","August 14, 2015","true","35.6"," 27 of 35 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","27","35","0","0"

After the shocking ending of The Witcher leaving us with a cliffhanger, The Witcher 2 starts shortly after the predecessor. Geralt of Rivia, after saving King Foltest of Temeria, works for him now, as a personal bodyguard. Hunting traitors, Foltest sieges a castle and “invite” Geralt to help his army. Something shocking happens in the action-packed epic prologue, and now Geralt must prove he is saying the truth, and have his vengeance, seeking a mysterious man. The Witcher 2 storyline is more action-packed than the first one. It’s epic, it’s complex and have a lot of politics involved. Also, you have to make dramatic choices, that even before the half of the game, show a totally different perception of the entire story, making it almost two in one. (Beat the game two times for the full experience!) Personally, I prefer the first Witcher story, but the second one is really better in showing it’s themes and involves a lot of more things happening in the world, with decisions that matter even in The Witcher 3, drawing to one possible conclusion, showed in an epic CG. The ending does not disappoint and put another cliffhanger that serve as a promise for the epic The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, the conclusion of the saga. Character development is very good and you will possible love two characters, Saskia and Ioverth. They’re amazing and shows a good background. But… it’s The Witcher! Everyone have their own personal story and unique quests, everything in the world have something behind it. The game’s campaign is shorter than the first one, because is kind of divided in two, but its more action packed like I also said and includes even more epic Boss Battles, that I bet will surprise you. Besides the campaign being smaller, the game itself is bigger, have more quests, bigger areas to explore and more content! The graphics are impressive, as still of today. The darker style of the game shows beautiful scenarios and regions, and well done animations, a problem from the first game. Alongside the epic soundtrack and sound effects, it all boils down to the amazing fantasy atmosphere the game shows you. The movimentation is more fluid than in the first game and you can even climb some obstacles. Combine this with combat that also shows an amazing innovation. Maybe the worst aspect of the first game, turned in one of the triumphs in The Witcher 2. The combat combines the Signs again, but now it’s not a totally combo-based like the first one and have a lot of movements and sounds like more a hack’n’slash game, with truly epic fight scenes with all kinds of monsters, that are now bigger in number than on the first game. Contracts are back as always and you have to clean monster nests and destroy them. As this is the enhanced edition, it features better graphics, bugs correction, and all of the released DLC, so you may find trolls in the game world with some interesting stories, and there is also the special Arena mode where you fight waves of enemies. Talking about the game itself again, there’s a lot of weapons again, and this time, a lot of armors, something I found lacking in the first. You can breed potions as always that help you in combat and sometimes is even necessary for quests. The world feels alive and you have a lot of romance options, but this time with no romance cards, but explicit scenes, even more than its successor, including specially one with Triss…There is also a crafting system for the armor and weapons which gives you the best ones in the game. Now you can meditate (to pass time and brew potions) anywhere if there’s no enemies, so it’s more practical than the predecessor. Dice poker is present: you can play a game with almost everyone and it's very fun and have quests related. The perk and level up system is cool and works well. The bad aspects for the game includes some bugs, random crashes that make you lose your progress and even lose your save in some cases (do a lot of them) and the lack of “RPG interactions”. The first one had a lot of food, drinks that you could eat and an animation was showed. This one does not feature all of that and no animations are present. Ok, that's a minor thing but...my opinion. Another thing is the game can be too punitive at the beggining, not stimulating someone into proceeding in. After you level up a bit it becomes fun, however. Mini games are present in boss battles. And they are annoying. The inventory menus are kind of chunky for me, also.\n\n+High Replayability\n+Choices and consequences\n+Epic story with political background\n+Epic and amazing soundtrack and sound effects\n+Big Immersion\n+Customization, lots of weapons, armors and skills\n+Top quality realtime weather and passage of time\n+Charismatic characters\n+Beautiful scenarios with large areas\n+A lot of sidequests and talk\n+Cool scenarios\n+Variety of monsters even a dragon!\n+Lots of content\n+Fun combat\n+Romance scenes\n+Epic CGI in the start and in the end of the game.\n+Level up system\n+Dice poker\n+Boss battles\n+Arena mode\n\n-Some bugs\n-Random crashes\n-Annoying boss battles mini-games\n-Lack of minor details\n-Over-punitive beggining\n-A bit chunky inventory menus\n\n\nVa fail, Gwynbleidd.

Everything from the graphics to the systems behind the game are an amazing feat, one you would expect from a big named developer backed up by a huge budget. The looks of the game are not only unparalleled due to its PC only nature, but also because it presents a world that feels hand crafted. The attention to detail borders on the extreme: the clothes, the houses and buildings, the faces of the characters their weapons and in general every corner, nook and cranny of the world has a distinctive touch. The scenery is simply breathtaking, and if you are like me you will want to make a screenshot out of every frame. It also shows that you don't need an overabundance of browns and blood reds in your palette to show a gritty dark fantasy world. This game shows its maturity not through a pretense of adult topics or over the top action animations, but through a careful use of its elements and by showing the player some respect: yes, you are an adult, and you can handle these topics, because indeed the Witcher's is a dark world filled with conspiracies, racism and characters in between every single shade of gray. It is a living, breathing, unforgiving world.\nThe story is as complex as in the first game, filled with twists and choices that may change the fate of many, and forking paths that make a replay of the game not only encouraged, but required in order to see the extent to which they occur and diverge. Normal and hard difficulties are recommended and will test your skills if you don't face every battle with all seriousness, preparing beforehand by brewing and drinking potions and using all of your abilities during the fight, i.e. your swords your magic signs depending on what enemy you face and traps and bombs for your crowd control.\nThe actual combat is in no way dumbed down. It will still punish you if you go unprepared and you can't mash your way out of battles. It is in much better shape than in the first game, and friendly to both the use of a gamepad or mouse and keyboard. The user interface is slick and great looking.\nThe ending of the game comes abruptly, and you might feel that it doesn't solve every issue the game presents (the main storyline issues ARE solved, though). It is no excuse from what many will consider a downbeat ending, but in all honesty it doesn't detract a single beat from what this game does right, which is almost everything else. Even if you don't like the ending you will feel that the journey was worth it.\nIn the end I feel like I'm required to praise this game so high despite its shortcomings not because it is a perfect game, but because it is an honest one. When more and more AAA releases are done with specific quarters or demographics numbers behind, or executives who never play games are calling the shots, The Witcher 2 really feels developed to please it audience, to show them they too are tired of these.\nThere is a certain level of quality you expect from bigger developers which have more of a history and a name, because they deliver experiences that go way beyond what you might get from the indie guys. It is OK, they have the money and the numbers behind. This is a trend that has been changing in the last years and that no longer holds true in most cases though.\nIn this case in particular neither of these apply. In my mind CDProject RED are already the big name, from whom I will expect unrelenting quality. Because after what they achieved they can't be considered the little guy any longer. With the Witcher 2 they delivered a game that is truly above and beyond any RPG from the last years, that feels like a product of love, careful planning and an overall shout to fans and the gaming community that says "we know what you want, and we can deliver. Where others have failed you we will prevail." And God if they don't.\nA serious contender for the best game of 2011, and frankly there is little in the horizon that looks like it might compete with it. Five years from now when other games made by bigger companies are all forgotten in the $5 bargain bins of the world, many will be reinstalling this game to reminisce and fondly say: "yes, I played a game was this good in 2011, and it was glorious."\nCongratulations CDProject RED, you just released your first masterpiece.","May 27, 2015","true","103.4"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","20","24","0","0"

Need explanation? Read on.\n\nOK, let's make something perfectly clear. I've spent at least 17 hours in Witcher and although I've recommended it in my Steam review, I don't think too fondly of that game. I've never got through it. Although the story is OK (but not great), I consider Witcher to be ''buy it on sale'' title. Game mechanics are so broken I've lost all of my will to play it. I just couldn't stand it.\n\nAlthough a friend of mine (Witcher fanatic and a gaming journalist), a guy that says Skyrim can suck his balls, recommended Witcher 2 to me on more than a few occasions and although he pointed out the game is different than the first one, somehow I've managed not to get it until this last summer sale. And I didn't buy it this summer, either - this friend bought it for me as an act of protest because I've neglected an awesome game.\n\nDid I say awesome? Yes, I DID. Witcher 2 is AWESOME. It goes straight into a Chamber of greatness which includes titles such as Doom II, Duke Nukem 3D, Quake II and Morrowind.\n\nWitcher 2 brings an awesome and oh-so-needed upgrade to every single system of Witcher universe. The story gets really suspenful and interesting now, so great it leaves the first one in the dust. It makes it funny. Combat? ♥♥♥♥ing finally. No more mini-games click-on-time attacking that made me so nervous. This is a proper sword-wielding and cast-spelling game. Fighting numerous opponents is a joy now. You can dash and stab almost in perfect harmony; fights in Witcher 2 are soul-soothing experiences.

The game begins with compelling flashbacks in which you storm a castle, and it shows how the murder happened. Through the game, you are chasing the real killer as well as try to recover your memories about the Wild Hunt and Yennifer. You meet interesting characters (some from the 1st Witcher game), and in one point have to choose who will you follow. This changes the story quite a bit (mainly different location in chapter 2), so the game can be enjoyed in the 2nd replay.\n\nThe game has prologue, 3 chapters and an epilogue, with different maps you cannot return to when you finish the chapter.\nI don't think you must play Witcher 1 to enjoy it (I didn't finish it for instance).\n\nPros and cons:\n+ The game still looks very pretty.\n+ Good voice acting and quality mature dialog (even non clickable npcs ramble when you run by).\n+ Intriguing main story, the world is rich (although you might get lost with all the different names).\n+ You can 'steal' anything and nobody will attack you.\n+ You can sleep with a number of women (there's a cut scene with boobies and booties).\n+ Sweet soundtrack that fits nicely.\n+ Not black and white: monsters aren't necessarily bad. You also have a choice to kill or spare     some people which effects the political map of the world.\n+ You can skip dialogue and cut scenes.\n+ Some of the quests are very interesting...\n\n- ...but some are classic monster slaying type. Either eradicate xxx or you fight through monsters to get to the place, find item etc.\n- Walking back and forth can be a chore sometimes.\n- You must meditate to drink potions.\n- If you are trying to collect materials for crafting weapon/armor, the local shop will have good alternative relatively cheap, which makes crafting undervalued.\n\nI cannot really comment about fighting difficulty as I played on easy (focused on the story), but for me, the fighting mechanics were better than in Witcher 1.\nThe game has a few puzzles, but I also cannot comment on difficulty as I was mostly too lazy and just googled correct sequences.\n\nAll in all, it is a great game which can be bought really cheap on sales. If you haven't played Wild Hunt yet, I think these ~40 hours into Witcher world can be well spent before throwing yourself in the latest installment of the Witcher saga.","May 11","true","44.7"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","16","19","0","0"

The characters are deep and flawed and you feel for both the heroes and the villains, the dialogue is at times witty, at times profound, and the twisting, turning intrigue of nefarious plotting, civil war, and the corrupting influence of power is always engaging and motivating. On top of that, TW2 is a vast improvement in terms of visuals, and I dare say it remains one of the best looking games ever made.\n\nBut again, like TW1, it's flaws lie in the games technical aspects. The combat system is the most frequent target for criticism, and I must admit, when I first played the game before the balancing was patched it was the single most frustrating experience of my life. Perhaps it was the benefit of hindsight that assisted me, but my second playthrough was a breeze by comparison. In saying that, the combat remains difficult to learn and beginners are unfortunately punished for lacking the clairvoyance to know when one must save before a big battle. Generally speaking, the autosave points are placed a little more kindly than in TW1 and restarts will often only send you back to the start of a fight, but when they don't it can be an annoying experience. There's also a single poorly implimented stealth section towards the start, which again tests the commitment of newcomers. But once you understand that you can dodge-roll infinitely and you put a few points into your skills you'll find that, while not the most elegant system, it's far more interactive than that of TW1 and allows the player to become quite powerful when they get the hang of it.\n\nCriticism aside though, I'd say that this is a must-play RPG for any fan of the genre. It streamlines a lot (if not all) of the inconvenient gameplay quirks of the first game, and continues to build on Geralt's epic story in a beautiful and detailed world. I played through both games in preparation for TW3 (come on Steam, discount the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥!) and while I felt every one of my 33 hours in TW1, this game never felt like it overstayed its welcome. Ultimately I was sad to see it finish, especially as the last moment of gameplay is a wonderfully powerful emotional climax.\n\nI recommend this game at whatever price it's sold for.","June 16, 2015","true","50.6"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","83","15","18","4","1"

The trilogy has constantly changed to cater the needs and desires of it's fanbase, a thing most evidently found in the streamlining process of The Witcher 2 in regards to the first one in the series. The graphics in Assassins of Kings are gorgeous and demanding even after 5 years since it's release. You will need both a decent system and plenty of time to enjoy this game. It's not worth rushing through it or skipping any dialogue. In fact, I highly recommend that you play and finish The Witcher 1 first, so that you may import your very own  save file (and game choices) into Witcher 2. This save system and the choices that ultimately matter, make the series as fascinating as Mass Effect or Dragon Age. Only the best crafted RPGs care for player choices throughout several gameplays.","May 25","true","2.3"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","0"

If that's your thing, this is going to be enjoyed by you.\n-The world is the same as in Witcher 1; the people, the culture, "the orens" :-)\n-I was SO excited learning of the possibility to transfer saves from game to game in the genre (by the time I learned of this Mass Effect was doing so too, :-) I just loved anything to do with Witcher).\n\nCRITICISM\n-If you think I just won't stop praising this game, apart from an obvious comparison with Lord of the Rings, THIS GAME and all Witcher games CONTAIN GRAPHIC CONTENT, unlike and to the credit of LOTR, I would appreciate if there was a setting in our OPTIONS menu we could input that may limit the level of this CONTENT we are looking at without affecting gameplay, HEY, there are some young children looking at  cartoon images here of WHAT, then there's unbridled SWEARING that they are exposed to??!!.

The storyline, the combat, the graphics, they're all the best I've experienced so far. You are a witcher, a mutant, a monster slayer caught in political games. The story is engaging and it consists on choices that really matter and in this game, choices really shape the course of your adventure, as act 2 is not the same(depending on who you chose to follow) and act 3 has different goals. No matter what you choose, is worth playing more than one time, since this world is a gorgeaus one to explore. Side quests are interesting as the main quests, which means that doing everything is definitetly a joy. Combat is fluid yet tactical and it has some flaws(noticeable on higher difficulties). By tactics I mean not just the way you move, but the way you prepare; there are various potions with various effects, but some just fit to make your battles easier. The characters are fascinating and you'll find yourself never skipping a dialogue. The graphics are gorgeaus but demanding; you might not pass higher than medium settings(you should check the forums on this topic). Even on lower settings, being a PC game, you'll still have a great visual experience.\nIn conclusion, this game is a tremendous RPG which is highly appreaciated by old school player and new ones alike. There's nothing not to like, since everything shines(in a new dark medieval way).\nMy score for this jewel is 9.8.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dowlphin/recommended/20920/","dowlphin","Dandowlion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dowlphin/","265 products in account","This is one more of those cases like Portal where the first game felt like a real PC game and the next one feels more like a console-optimized interactive movie. (To a modest degree, but in that direction.)\nYes, the production value might be high, the story might be interesting, but I'm not reviewing a movie here, but a game.\n\nWhile in the first Witcher game, I liked the style, all its strong points so much, I could easily overlook the various weak points, but in this game, from the very beginning, I saw little but its flaws.\n\nAnd because I saw way too many to edit them elegantly, here is a list of notes of the things that bothered me, in no particular order:\n\n\n- Dithered lighting!\n- Anisotropic filtering is enforced in the nVidia driver (since the game doesn't seem to have the option), but it still runs on trilinear!)\nIn these two points the graphics in Witcher 2 are actually worse than in the first game.\n- Almost immediately vanishing corpses. (Same in the first game, but come on! Go with the times!)\n- No graphics engine or keyboard config settings in game, only via launcher. The first game had all of this.\n- Some fast-mouse-click QTE (quick time event) minigames are unnecessary and kind of harm immersion (sometimes practically "click now or die" - especially one scene in the prologue was annoying, since it was multi-phased and involved a sudden 180° change of camera view) - It makes little sense to expect very heightened adrenaline-pumping awareness while watching a cutscene and feels more like harassment.\nEven the relatively lame fist fight mechanics of the first game I found more appealing than mere WASD button pressing on command.\n- The precise-aim crosshair for daggers and such is almost invisible.\n- Some quest/dialogue progression in the prologue doesn't make much sense, i.e. leaving continuity holes\n- Selectable dialogue texts don't really match the Witcher's response that well. It's generally difficult to lead a conversation according to your true intention. You might end up accepting a task without wanting it. I often had to reload and try all options to at least get an idea of what I was doing.\n- Some dialogue barely audible because mumbled, need to reduce music volume (e.g. inn), but might be too low in other cases then.\n- Blood and dirt splatter on screen in cutscenes - harms immersion (4th wall breaking)\n- Some gold bags might be untouchable due to usable objects nearby.\n- An occasional geometry flicker issue that I saw in the first game, too, but no other game. Also some texture gaps.\n- Not being able to take a killed guard's sword during a prison break is kinda stupid, and it's not like it would be overpowered in that situation.\n- Game crashed before boarding a boat in one scene - couldn't save in that segment for some non-apparent reason, so had to redo and loot all the stuff I took there.\n- No launcher bypass possible using witcher2.exe or via other means. Launcher then places a symbol in the task bar just to add annoyance to the whole thing.\n- Inventory UI is kind of stupid in that it shows no stats for items in the list while highlighted, and menu items change size when highlighted, which impairs usability.\n- The game package doesn't even include the manual. It's just 7 MB, but I had to download it separately. Also outdated!\n- None of the 4 inventory sorting icons (whose meanings I had to find out by myself) gives you a value-for-weight sorting.\n- Inventory sorting keeps reverting to time-of-pickup.\n- Dropping an item from the inventory scrolls the whole list back to the top.\n- Key-based inventory scrolling doesn't use Windows settings. Repeat rate and trigger delay is way too high for my convenience. Also, PGUP/PGDN have no function.\n- Voices during conversations often have a strong reverb that doesn't match the environment at all.\n- A more general issue that was already in the first game: You can take stuff out of storage crates and such, and none seems to be owner-tagged, although most of it should. In a game that seeks to create immersion, this common RPG trait is always disturbing that.\n- Message "item cannot be sold" when trying to put it in my storage. Thus, unsellable items cannot be put in storage. Apparently the storage is just a crudely repurposed vendor.(which can lead to bugs)\n- Quest texts go ahead in time, telling what's gonna happen later or supposed to happen. The player doesn't seem to be considered relevant in these things and it feels like a bit of a spoiler.\n- Wavering camera during dice minigame is unrealistic and annoying.\n- Missing comparative feature of inventory item stats with worn item stats.\n- Fight club quest - when I'm asked to lose, I cannot decide to just quit, only accept the scam or fight (to win) anyway.\n- Often repeating NPC lines. Less would be more (immersive). They say the exact same thing every time you pass after an area has loaded.\n- Dialogue response timeouts - stupidest thing ever. For most dialogues it's perfectly fine or you to think about what to say for as long as you like (and I don't see a problem with that, and it's often necessary because the dialogue options are so unclear), but for some reason I don't see some dialogues will default to whichever option your cursor is on after a few seconds. If you don't notice the timer icon right away, you won't even know what you just chose.\n- When moving through the world, occasionally there's a loading symbol in the lower right corner, but loading is almost lag-free, so that icon is distracting, because when it briefly flashes, I keep thinking I just walked over a lootable object.\n- Geralt looks straight and not down when he's talking to a dwarf.\n- Small things like cursor not staying on menu when exiting to main menu with intention of selecting quit game. UI usability sucks in this game.\n- At least one quest didn't allow me a proper outcome in the journal and a quest tied into that one was absurdly unrealistic regarding changing a shop owner's conscience.\n- I am led through endless cutscenes that last long enough to let any potion run out and then right after that I'm in battle with a boss enemy, without potions. (Maybe the timers halt, but if they do, that would actually harm immersion again.)\n- First boss battle sucked, because while the game wants to look like a movie, the difficulty style is like hardcore indie games where you are likely to fail dozens of times, which I literally did. I must have tried 30 times. I felt like an actor and the director was shouting at me because I didn't do every move exactly according to script. I had to concentrate more on the "click now" like symbols on the screen than on the boss itself. I also at first didn't know when exactly the battle started and had to reload just to be able to drink potions in advance without wasting some of their meager 10-minute effect. Then I was frustrated because it used the wrong trap, despite me having selected the special trap for the boss. I eventually realized after several tries that I was supposed to left-click the marker with my mouse to place it. During the battle with a gigantic menacing boss, crows were sitting on a nearby corpse as if nothing was happening.\n- Many events could be enacted in a non-instantly-lethal way and especially in normal game mode. But instead: cutscene after cutscene. One time I was to play another character in a short event and fought someone in a duel. I fought well. The moment I defeated him... cutscene where I fail. This is disappointing and borderline insulting to the player. Don't let me fight if you intend to cheat me out of my deserved victory.\n\nBottom line: This game often feels like it's trying to make me its trained monkey and has its fun toying with me, like I'm just an employee meant to move the story forward.\nA lot about this game is the same stuff that put me off about games like Castlevania LoS 1+2 (of which I played the demos).\n\nIt gets surprisingly easy later-on though.\n\n- Geralt of Review","April 11, 2014","false","60.1"," 44 of 73 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","44","73","0","0"

After purchasing the first and second games for the price of a chocolate milk, I have spent over 85 hours on the games. I really enjoyed the first one, then when I played this it blew my expectations out of the water. The story, the characters, the settings, but most of all the highly improved sword and fighting mechanics. I finally felt in control of Geralt.\n\nThis game was smooth and well polished at the time of playing. Although some of the game seemed quite easy, it regularly proved to be difficult in others requiring you to think about your steps. Not challenging enough to make you give up, but enough to really involve you in the battle. Yet, this is where my one complain of the game comes up. You cannot consume any of your alchemy items or oil your blade once the fight has started. A lot of the time you may not know who you are going to fight or when. Since all consumables are timed, you don't want to always use them up. This meant sometimes saving your game, running around, loading back to the previous save to know what you should consume. I hope in the 3rd title this is changed back.\n\nOver all, amazing game. Will play through again since the story can go 2 ways. I want to see both paths that Geralt takes and am really looking forward to playing through again.\n\nAlso want to see how many boobies I can convince women to show me since so far it's 100% more in this game than real life.","May 14, 2015","true","44.3"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","76","13","17","5","1"

Every character had their own ambitions, attitudes and reason for their actions. I found that I either liked or was undecided about a character, with a few characters that I hated. The storyline flowed well and almost every side quest made sense given the situation that the character was in. You even had some sidequests were you had to track creatures nest and blow them up which was fun and a different version to the usual kill x collect x formula . You were able to make multiple choses in the game and almost every chose matter towards either the main storyline or a sidequest and possibly both. Many of the choses that you choose from had its positive and negatives. You rarely got an option that seemed like the best option but more like 3 or 4 options that could be good but also could be bad. I like this and made me think of what option I should choose. Some warning there is a lot of dialogue about the political issues of Geralt's world and they do shoot out a lot of names which may push some people away. But if your intrigued about  political struggles, regicide, betrayal, mystery and even some romance then you will love this storyline.\n\nGameplay:\nUtterly love the gameplay. It is an action rpg with a skill tree, some what, similar to diablo or other action rpgs. But the overall gameplay is different then your typical action rpg where you kill a huge mobs of monster one right after the other. In this game you do more exploring around and talking to people than killing creatures. But when you do kill creatures they are incredibly dynamic battles were you have options on how you want to kill your foe. Do you want to ensare the creature in a trap and stab it with you sword or do you want to shock it with a bomb and run in for the fatal blow. Also you do not stand their and fight the monster exchanging blows, no you try to dodge or parry the blows so you don't get killed because you can be overwhelmed in the game pretty easily if your not careful. Oh but dont forget your potions. There is an alchemy system where you can make potions using herbs that you find in abundance in the wild as well as oils and poisons that can be added to your weapon for a short period of time. These potions will increase your stats, or allow you to see in the dark, some even give you advantages at a cost of another stat being reduced. These potions are extremely helpful and usually only last around 5 to 10 minutes unless you have some points in the alchemy skill tree. Potions can only be used before a battle starts and you have a limit on how many potions you can drink. So I enjoyed thinking about what potions I should use and when I should use them. You are also capable of creating bombs, traps, armor and weapons which I have seen before, but still adds something to the game, especially the bombs and traps.\n\nGraphics:\nThe graphics is just amazing for its time and I was suprised at the differences between the looks of some characters that were from the first Witcher game. I also liked how original the creatures looked  in comparison to many other games I have played. This difference added to the dark tone of the game quite well. The graphics made exploring around a lot more enjoyable overall.\n\nReplayability:\nThere is some good replay value to this game. There are several different difficulty levels that you can play on, and the storyline branches out in two different ways. Therefore, you will have to play the game again to see the other part of the storyline that you missed the first time. There are also differences in sidequests depending on which storyline branch you choose as well as different results to the side quests depending on your choices.\n\nCons:\n\nYes, like all games there are some cons to this game. The big one is... the map. It might just be me but I found the map to be utterly confusing to understand.  Some things on the map that looked like walls ended up not being walls and other parts of the map that didn't look like walls ended up being walls. I was playing on the controller and there seemed to be no shortcut button to see the bigger version of the map, you had to open up the selection menu and press map every single time which got on my nerves a bit. Another con to this game is the game's inability to work properly. Sometimes the game would either slow down making gameplay difficult or just crash. Also this issue could very much be an issue with my computer and not the game. Another issue I had with the game was although the towns were well thought out and dynamic the same people walking around kept saying the exact same two or three lines every single time you would pass by them, unless you were having a conversation with them. Next time I hope that the people have atleast a few more lines that they could say.\n\nSo overall, this is a great game that you should play to get prepared for Witcher 3, which looks amazing.","June 9, 2014","true","71.5"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","2"

It really is. I didn't play the first one that much - I didn't feel engaged. The world was interesting, but the way it "felt" didn't get me and I got a bit boring. But heck, I wanted to play the second one, because I tried it once at a friend's house when it came out and I had good memories lingering about it.\nSo I bought it.\n\nAnd I did good.\n\nThe Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings is quite the improvement. Everything feels better executed. The game is more politic-centered, compared to the first one (for what I can tell). Combat is more polished - though it could be better. The world you play in is stunning, full of rich developed characters with whom you may bond - or not. Your choice.\nAfter finished the first Act, I found mysfelf desperate for more and more. Good thing is - I received it. More and even more goodness.\n\nFlaws? Not many. There are some things that I would have liked to be a tad different. For example:\n\n1) Conversations with your pals; sometimes they feel a bit plain. I mean, unlike Mass Effect, for example, where you usually have more possibilities on this matter, here conversations more often fall into some questions regarding the (politic) plot and nothing more. No hanging out or anything like it, for the most part.\n2) Final Boss Fight; too damn easy. For real.\n3) Animations; very few of them. Maybe it's asking too much, but still.\n\nAnd that's all I can think about right now. Minor things that don't really ♥♥♥♥ all over the experience at all. The Witcher 2 is, overall, a really great, great game. Story is quite good - with twists and all. Characters are easy to like or hate and the end leaves you hanging at the very edge, gasping for another final adventure - The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.

Kudos to you. Let me next congratulate you for looking at the reviews of this game, as rightly you should. Now let me slap you in the f*cking jaw for clicking on "Negative Reviews".\n\nEntrance a little too strong? Well consider it a wake up call.\n\nIf you have played many an RPG and completed it with a lingering craving for depth and lore, then this game is your healing salve. This game has some of the richest storytelling I have ever had the pleasure of being part of, paired with it's sheer beauty and somewhat impressive mod support, you can not go wrong with this purchase.\n\nThe voice acting is on point, similar to that of Fable, with its regional 'Typically British' dialect which is laced with humour and one-liners. The gameplay, whilst some suggest is 'clunky', works well considering the type of game this is. The graphics are demanding, but if you have the power to run this at high settings, they will leave you awestruck. The storyline is fresh and cleverly written (with enough room for plenty of side quests), and although it seems typically linear, the areas you visit are open enough to allow you to breath.\n\nThe game is without a doubt targetted at a more mature audience, with an abundance of nakedness particularly from the female cast (which is brilliant for us single men - am I right?!) as well as a great deal of 'curse' words throughout. I can not say exactly how to play this game, nor can I elaborate on how much you will enjoy it - you quite literally just have to sit down and indulge its richness and take your time, let yourself break away from the quest grinding, go explore, talk to NPC's, loot houses, do some crafting... whatever it is you take delight in, just... do it.\n\nIts simple, and your decision to purchase this game should be too. The negative reviews that flood this page genuinely are talking out of their ars*s, their play time alone is enough to suggest they havent actually PLAYED the game. They have obviously gotten past the tutorial and cried because everything wasn't handed to them on a silver plate.\n\nFor roughly the 6th time now I've seen this game go on sale for less than £5... If you are worrying about "wasting" £5 then you have issues. Seriously, you could find that on the street. Or you could go busking for an hour, whatever.\n\nBuy it.","January 2, 2014","true","24.7"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Athmier/recommended/20920/","Athmier","Athmier","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Athmier/","107 products in account","Awhile ago I made a Witcher 1 review, and although I enjoyed it I felt  it had some annoying bits which unfortunately lessened the experience.\nIn The Witcher 2, nearly anything I harped on before was fixed.\n\nThe combat is much improved, especially with the Combat Rebalance Mod. (if it's your first playthrough use vanilla combat first)\n\nThe story is awesome, although I feel the first one had more of an impact. It starts right after the first one but it gives enough info to still get the general gist of the story. I still highly recommend you do so you won't get lost.\n\nThe graphics are amazing. It's really jaw-dropping once when you realize that it came out in the same year as Skyrim. It's simply stunning. Ubersampling is nice as it makes the obvious aliasing disappear, but it taxes even my GTX 970. You may prefer turning it off completely and dealing with the aliasing or using SweetFX.\n\nThe music was less memorable to me than the first one. There wasn't anything I really particularly liked, but in general it's okay.\n\nThe content in this game is huge. I've played it twice as much as I have the first game. Without spoiling anything, you have to make an extremely important choice at a certain point which changes the game so much it's as if it's completely new.\n\nWhile there's still no jumping, and some invisible walls, they never irritated me in my playthrough. The maps are so large and the motion of climbing and descending cliffs are fluid.\n\nSigns and potions were a much bigger deal in this game than the last. I played it on normal difficulty, and while not as hard as Dark Souls, without a proper strategy and using brewing potions you're going to die...very easily.\n\nHowever one rather major con is that the skill tree alchemy is useless. There's a limit to the number of skill points you get, and you'd much rather spend them on tangible things that affect your overall combat skills, not potions. Similarly, I probably used only one mutagen in the whole game.\n\nThere's a wide range of weapons and armor in the game, so you won't really need to buy from merchants. You'll likely want to craft them yourself, or find good ones through quests and loot.\n\nAlso this is personal preference but I found a gamepad to be better than KB+M, ignoring the inventory which is good with a KB+M, but annoying with a controller. I'd constantly unequip my boots when using one and found it really hard to manage my stuff. I still enjoy using a KB+M, although I think I prefer a controller with this game.\n\n\nIt's an extremely solid game that any RPG fan should at least try. The environment is vast so you won't feel restricted or as if you're going down a corridor. The combat is good, not Dark Souls level but not Skyrim level either. It's also far better with  the free Combat Rebalance mod. Story is excellent as expected.\n\nAlthough I feel like it's an amazing game, I just don't think it reaches a generally perfect 10/10 but instead an excellent 9/10. Replayability is low for those who don't like seeing the same story again and combat can be tedious and downright frustrating at times (Not to mention targeting sucks).You'll want to save often as dying can send you way far back but too many saves causes frequent crashing. (I recommend disabling Steam Cloud) There's no way to move quicker, no sprinting or mounts. There's rolling, but it can't be done in areas like towns where they don't want your sword out. I also think the general atmosphere in the Witcher 1 was better, it had a darker and more serious tone although quite bleak. It seems The Witcher 3 is going to adopt a far more brighter tone, which is a tiny bit of a shame.\n\nEDIT 1: After looking at Witcher 3 gameplay, it's obvious that CD Projekt Red downgraded their graphics. At the very least, they did not deliver on the advertised game shown for 35 minutes back in 2014. This is a bit disappointing, I even remember in my first Witcher 1 review I said, "Oh, CD Projekt Red don't downgrade for consoles! They aren't like Ubisoft!" Originally the Witcher 3 was going to be a preorder, but now it's something I'll pick up a little later when I have time.\n\nEDIT 2: Looks like the Witcher 3 is an excellent game! Rejoice! Still miss the old graphics though, but at least CDPR admitted the downgrade.","February 26, 2015","true","63.0"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","11","14","2","0"

In The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings you play as Geralt of Rivia, a legendary Witcher, based on the novels of Andrzej Sapkowski. Witchers are monster slayers for hire, with their mutated bodies and skills they wipe out monsters for a pay. But in this saga Geralt tries to regain his memory which he lost when fighting the Wild Hunt. (Read novels or play TW1/2 to know more about the story) on his way he has to deal with choices that have influence on your progess in the game.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPROS\n\n+ Beautiful breathtaking graphics\n+ Epic long and interesting story\n+ Non-linear gameplay\n+ EXTREMELY immersive atmosphere\n+ Choices are important, in the game you always have the possibility to make choices you like and they all have their different consequences.\n+ Awesome soundtrack\n+ Interesting sidequests, unlike other RPGs or games these sidequests will totally not get you bored.\n+ Great and original characters\n+ Possibility to lay traps and hunt\n+ Different Monsters are spread throughout every location\n+ You are able to explore caves, areas, forests, etc\n+ Dynamic combat, dodging and attacking on the right time is VERY important.\n+ Alchemy, you can craft potions and enhance your weapons in order to prepare for a battle.\n+ Really nice boss battles\n+ Skill tree that has 4 different ways with useful abilities, Training, Swordmanship, Magic, Alchemy\n+ Huge arsenal of weapons, magic light armor to heavy, obtainable through sidequests, lootable chests, barrels, etc throughout the whole world, even forgeable with the right materials and diagrams!\n+ Steam trading cards\n\nCONS\n\nThis game totally has NO cons at all. I will just state some stuff that might be a con to other people. But in my opinion this game is way too perfect to have cons.\n\n- It really seems complicated in the beginning but you'll get used to it, dont give up to fast. (You'll understand what I mean if you play the game for the first time)\n- The combat system is not like your average RPG game, it has special and dynamic mechanics. Every enemy has a different pattern and the way you approach it is very important. Dont start rushing to kill your enemy, block and dodge till you learn how he moves and attacks. And maybe which magic is fatal to him. Even when playing it at easy mode you will struggle at a certain moment. Even I, myself, had died a couple of times at a boss battle because of not being serious and not knowing his pattern and style.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI double-recommend you this game, you'll totally fall in love with it. TW2 is a huge improvement to TW1, you can start at TW2 since you get the storyline told of TW1. TW3 is coming in May so while you are reading this review dont hesitate to get TW2 and prepare yourself for the third saga of The Witcher after you finished this game. The atmosphere, characters, maturity, choices (Which are VERY important to a lot of people, no one likes scripted stories and wants it their own way while they progess through the game) and many other stuff makes this game so special. This game is totally a must have for RPG lovers, even if you never tried RPGs or dont like them then try this one. Its worth the money and wont disappoint you.","March 15, 2015","true","18.5"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","11","14","2","0"

The graphical details for the female bosom in this game are absolutely exquisite and it encapsulates the minute detail of real breasts. The passionate scenes inflict many emotions upon the player and it seems as if they are in the action, as the pole stiffens or the sponge gets soaked. This could be attributed to the curves that have been added to each female in this game and for females the masculine body of Geralt. It was disappointing that my character couldn't share such a passionate connection with every single female character, and it detracted from the reality of the game as it could be possible to be with many females outside of the game. I think the name, the Assassins of Kings is well done, but I think it should have a name change to the Assassin of Queens as Geralt silently and lustfully assassinates his prey leaving them in a sedated and satisfied state post-conflict.","January 24, 2015","true","53.1"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","72","13","18","23","2"

Sadly not many games allow you to save on your own time and it's certainly appreciated at least by me when a developer includes it. You can save anywhere when you're not in combat or a cutscene.\n\n● Unique Outlook Through Different Eyes. One unique aspect of the Witcher 2: A.O.K. is that  throughout the game you're able to play as different characters and the choices you choose with those characters greatly impacts the story.\n\nAspects of Witcher 2 Worth Criticizing\n● Quick Time Events. An overwhelming majority of quests involving melee combat include this "mechanic." I've said it time and time again, quick time events are not a valid combat mechanic and only conceal the developers incompetence.\n\n● Lack of Game Funtionality.

In the Witcher 2: A.O.K. you use Mouse1 to activate doors, talk to people, light torches, fight, climb up or down ledges, and quick time events; pretty much the majority of things in this game.

It is an absolute masterpiece of a game with an awesome storyline, graphics that stay beautiful and full of detail throughout  the game, interesting characters and a fun and exhilarating combat.\n\nThe story is an exceptional beauty throughout , with moral choices that effect small changes like killing a character or letting them go, and huge changes that effects the entire story and leads you on different paths and goals. the game is full of cleverly thought out and designed quests, from the wonderfully interesting main plot to side quest that'll have you finding and killing ghosts , solving crimes and if you don't want to go out and discover the mysteries beyond the walls you can stay in at the tavern and earn yourself money by gambling on fights or competing in them .\n\nThe combat can be quite challenging and can require preparation like the placement of traps, the drinking of potions that will increase weapon damage , health and many more and covering your weapons in oil and poison so the sword deals more damage and has effects. This all has to be done before combat so the player must cleverly think and path his next battle. once mastered the combat is a very fun and accelerating departure from other games combats that involves hacking and slashing by simply mashing a single button till the target is dead.\n\nThe Graphics are a outstanding astonishment ( on maxed out anyway) , with an unbeatable lighting effect and texture that doesn't get poorer and poorer  the closer you get to it and focused on, the games textures stay amazing throughout .\n\noverall Witcher 2  is an incredible game and if you have a powerful enough rig it can be an amazingly beautiful one as well, with a different but fun and creative combat and a cleverly written and presented story  Witcher 2 is a master piece of a game and without a doubt is worth buying .\n\nJust a little something to add this game can be made even better or made different by adding these two mods that can be found on the Witcher 2 nexus. ( There are other mods but these are the most effective and a thrill to use.)\n\nRise of the Sword - this mod changes and adds in a huge amount of features that includes changing the shop to buy new and epic items and changing the combat to use more attacks and most importantly the ability to change and customize the camera to have it be where ever you want it to be. ( doesn't have to be but would recommend playing the game through and then playing it again on a second play through with this mod installed to get the full effect and fell the difference.)\n\n\nhttp://www.nexusmods.com/witcher2/mods/672/?tab=1&navtag=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nexusmods.com%2Fwitcher2%2Fajax%2Fmoddescription%2F%3Fid%3D672%26preview%3D&pUp=1\n\nExtreme Quality Flora v1 - This mod Dramatically increases grass , trees and moss rendering distance. it also increases the detail on bushes , shrubs and trees and most importantly Grass pop-in is completely eliminated. ( this is a huge recommend if the grass pop in is annoying anyone and you simply want the game to look even more better.)\n\nhttp://www.nexusmods.com/witcher2/mods/653/?","June 12, 2014","true","240.6"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","2"

You play as Geralt of rivia, a witcher. Witchers are white haired mutants engineered to be professional monster slayers and are generally feared and looked down upon by regular people, Geralt uses two swords, a silver sword to fight monsters and a steel sword for humans. Because the game is a direct sequel the opening prologue puts you right into the action and new players to the series can get a little lost, however you don’t need to play the first game to fully understand what is going on, plus the witcher 2 has an extensive journal with all the information. The prologue starts off with Geralt imprisoned after being framed for assassinating the king during a siege, he’s being interrogated by the kings special forces and you play through his memories as he explains what happened during the siege. Later you manage to escape from the prison and your quest to clear your name and find out who’s really behind the series of assassinations begins.\n\nThe story will take you to a number of different kingdoms and cities and you’ll meet lots of very interesting characters, how different events happen during the story is based on the decisions you make, As the story goes on the plot gets deeper and deeper, and the bigger picture becomes clearer ,who will geralt save? who will he kill? who’s side will he choose? the faith of entire kingdoms can be directly or indirectly be affected by the choices you make, the line is blurred between pure good or evil and there’s no clear morality, you do what you think is best, sometimes choosing the lesser evil in the name of the greater good, The role you play in the game has a very heavy effect on the story. The game has 16 very different endings and fully completing it will take you around 40 hours. Also i have to mention the game and story touch on drugs, murder, torture, ♥♥♥♥, incest, racism, nudity and more, however they all fit very well into the witcher universe and make the game feel very realistic and mature. If i was to compare it to a tv series it’s like game of thrones but with a richer world and with an eastern European flavour added to it.\n\nGameplay wise the Witcher 2 is in third person and you fight in real time, combat is not easy, Geralt is not invincible and a group of knights could easily kill him if you’re not careful. Geralt can you use a number of potions and traps as well as his mutant abilities to give him an advantage in combat, potions can help him do more damage to certain monsters or improve his health, while his mutant abilities can be used to deflect arrows or stun opponents.\n\nThe witcher 2 is a fantastic sequel, everything that was great about the first game has been immensely improved, the combat, the story, the characters all have been improved to a degree that is almost unbelievable, graphically it is one the best looking games ever made. The game is truly a masterpiece with a rich and detailed world, good gameplay and a deep and interesting story.","March 31, 2014","true","73.1"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyberghost/recommended/20920/","cyberghost","Cyberghost","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyberghost/","1190 products in account","Pinning down precisely what makes the world of The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings so enthralling took me some time. It's not that the fiction is particularly "mature," though that's undoubtedly a term that will be tossed around until the next hyper-gritty fantasy game pops up. Think about it for a second: The Witcher, Geralt of Rivia, is a crag-faced, cat-eyed, gravelly-voiced mutant hardass who only stops screwing and fighting when occasion calls for a philosopher, at which point he dutifully duels scholars and monarchs with a tongue as sharp as either of his two swords. He is a character straight out of a 15-year-old boy's misused English notebook; the wounded warrior poet who, by the way, gets all the consequence-free sex he can handle, since he's totally shooting blanks, bro. And sure, he's stoic -- but he's also got a sensitive soul somewhere beneath that scar-laden chest of his, damn it.\n\nNo, what makes the Witcher's world so absorbing is an amazingly cohesive and consistent visual vocabulary that is -- and I know this is going to sound ridiculous -- far more logical than is typical for fantasy games. The impoverished fishermen of the riverside village of Flotsam shuffle around in nothing but ruddy underwear. Dumpy town guards patrol in filthy rags that still bear their national colors. Ornate attire is (for once) consigned solely to the upper class. Buildings look planted and properly dilapidated. This may seem a small thing, but from the first minutes of the game, it's clear how much effort has gone into researching how a society like the one portrayed would look; this medieval civilization, infused with -- but not dominated by -- magic and mystery (props to developer CD Projekt), is just awesome.\n\nSimilarly impressive: the degree to which the story changes based on your actions. Game makers (and publishers, and shareholders, and preview writers) love to crow on about choices and consequences. Hell, if you buy the PR spin, every single BioWare game in the past decade has been a watershed moment for cause and effect in video game storytelling. But frankly, the lofty language usually leads to a letdown -- the best we usually get are mundane tics on a morality slider that may or may not unlock a new dialogue tree, or perhaps a new companion somewhere down the road. I'd go so far as to argue that the only stable of games that's been quietly, consistently offering a serious set of genuinely game-altering forks-in-the-road for nearly a decade now is Acquire's Way of the Samurai series.\n\nNot anymore.\n\nWhile we have the underlying storyline of murder, intrigue, and (more stupidly) amnesia to which The Witcher 2 continually returns, the minutiae is wholly malleable. The allies Geralt makes on his journey and the enemies he combats shift with your mood swings; larger decision points alter the landscape of the world dramatically, but even minor events can cause repercussions much later in the game -- and how the whole thing ends is entirely your choice. Reading after-action reports from fellow players is like a game unto itself. Nobody seems to experience quite the same scenarios.\n\nNot all is well in the Pontar Valley, however. Combat, for instance, is a serious problem made even worse by a poorly implemented, obscenely difficult and unhelpful opening segment. Plow into battle unprepared, and you might as well expect the worst: Even on moderate difficulty levels, this is not a game in which potential sources of aid can be ignored. Traps, bombs, magic, daggers, pre-battle potions... every tool in Geralt's arsenal is an absolute necessity.\n\nOnce I got the basics down, the extremely acrobatic, constantly active feint-and-parry style of Witcher warfare became seriously enjoyable -- just don't expect the prologue section to teach you much of anything valuable. And even when I finally felt like a proper monster-hunting mutant badass, I occasionally came across the rare room or fight so absurd that I had to wonder if CD Projekt understood the limitations of its own combat system. Geralt in a room too cramped to allow for falling back and trap placement? Battles before which you have no time to meditate and drink potions? No thanks.\n\nWorse still, the user interface only exacerbates the combat system's flaws by forcing the player to keep an eye on everything but the melee itself. Geralt's vigor (read: mana) meter, health meter, buff/debuff indicators, and equipped spells/items are all scattered across the screen, which is a serious drawback when you're surrounded by screeching harpies.\n\nBut not even a terrible introductory sequence can take away from what is otherwise a fantastic game. Sure, the story is goofy, and at times the fighting is offensively clunky. The world isn't as colossal as the first Witcher's, and the ending is a bit of a tease. But in a time when I rarely bother to finish single-player games, I'm happy (and slightly embarrassed) to say that I'm already several hours into a second playthrough of Assassins of Kings. And I can't think of a better compliment than that.\n\nPros:\nEngrossing world\nstory has more branches than a sycamore\ntechnically astonishing\ngreat voice acting.\nCons:\nCombat takes getting used to and never becomes fantastic\npacing problems\ntoo many quick-time events.\nMy Rating: 9.2/10","January 31","true","18.4"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

The game boasts a myriad of mature themes and storylines, and it is very enjoyable for those who appreciate impactful decision-making in their games.  However, the sheer magnitude of the game may cause it to drag a bit for completionists.\n\nThis game is absolutely beautiful.  The story is deep, rich, complex and mature.  The world feels immersive and lived in.  There are sufficient RPG elements (crafting, items, leveling, spells) to appease any fan.\n\nIn order to experience everything in the branching storyline, you will need to play through it a few times… or at least play through sections of the game a few times to see the results of different decisions.\n\nThe combat is probably the weak point of the game, as it is pretty bland and on higher difficulties can be frustrating.  You may want to consider playing on a low difficulty to just enjoy the story and avoid frustration.\n\nIf you can afford both the time and the money, I suggest you play the first one through at least once before playing this.  Or at the very least read a synopsis of the plot of the first game.\n\nThere are dozens of aspects I could go into detail describing when it comes to The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition, but it doesn’t seem necessary.  If you are a fan of epic RPGs with dark, immersive stories and captivating atmospheres then you will most likely enjoy this.  If you are someone who has trouble getting invested in story-driven, slow-paced experiences, then you may want to look elsewhere for your next game.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","November 18, 2013","true","66.7"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

Everything from the graphics to the moving parts behind the game are an incredible feat, one you would expect from big named companies backed by a large budget. The looks of the game were not only unparalleled in 2011 due to its PC only nature, but also because it gives us a world that feels hand crafted. The attention to detail borders on the insane: the clothes, the houses and buildings, the faces of the characters, along with their weapons and in every corner, nook and cranny of the world there is that distinctive touch. The scenery is simply breathtaking, and if you're like me you will want to take a screenshot out of almost every frame. It also shows that you don't need an overabundance of browns and blood reds in your palette to show a gritty dark fantasy world.\n\nThis game shows its maturity not through a pretense of adult topics or with over the top action animations, but through a careful use of its core elements and by showing the player some respect: "Yes, you're an adult, and you can handle these topics!" Because indeed the Witcher is a dark world filled with conspiracies, racism and characters who live between every single shade of gray. It is a living, breathing, unforgiving world.\n\nThe story is as complex as the first , filled with twists and choices that may change the fate of many, and forking paths that make a replay of the game not only encouraged, but something you'll want to do in order to see the extent to which they occur and diverge. Normal and Hard, as easy is just that, difficulties are recommended and will test your skills if you do not face every battle with all seriousness, preparing beforehand by brewing and drinking potions and using all of your abilities during the fight. i.e. your swords, your magic signs, depending on what enemy you face and the traps and bombs for your crowd control and a little breathing room at times.\n\nThe actual combat is in no way dumbed down, even if it feels less based on timing then the first. It will still punish you if you go unprepared and you can't mash your way out of battles. It is more finely tuned than in the first game, and friendly to both the use of a gamepad or mouse and keyboard. The UI is slick, easy to figure out and great looking.\n\nThe ending of the game is abrupt, but one youve worked for. You might feel that it doesn't solve every issue in the game (the main storyline issues ARE resolved, though). It is no excuse from what many will consider a downbeat ending, in which it still sets up for the next in the series greatly though.  In all honesty it doesn't take away a single ounce from what this game does right, which is almost everything else. Even if you don't like the ending you will feel that the journey was worth it. There are also quite a few endings, 8 in fact, more if you consider all the side choices that could affect it.  Some are much better feeling than others, and all of which lead into the next game quite nicely.\n\nWith the Witcher 2, CD Projekt RED delivered a game that is truly above and beyond any RPG from the few last years, it plays and feels like a product of love, careful planning and an overall shout to fans of the gaming community that says "We know what you want, and we can deliver. Where others have failed you we will prevail." And man did they ever. I would play this game again 5 years from now, just to remember how great a game it truly and to see how masterpiece RPGs are done.","February 21","true","61.6"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","2"

Other than that there are changes which I would tentatively summarize as "streamlining done right" which is quite a claim in this day and age – alchemy removes the need for alcohol basis which finally lets Geralt stop being a walking cellar lugging around all kinds of high quality alcohol. It should also be noted that changes like these don't really simplify the game in any significant fashion primarily because other elements, like actual gear variety, addition of proper crafting and traps, etc easily offset whatever may have been removed.  That's not to say everything is perfect because some people had problems with the way combat works and overreliance on Quen aka protection Sign as a crutch, but I never really went through those problems so I can't testify to that.\n\nStory and characters of the game are an entirely separate beast worthy of being mentioned on their own. Witcher 2 continues after the first game, but works perfectly fine as a standalone story, although it is HIGHLY recommended that you're familiar with the original to understand who's who and what's happening in general. It retains the same old moral ambiguity and holds back no punches for the player but it's even better this time around thanks to increased world reactivity as well as choices & consequences which are really cranked up to 11. Fact that Act 2 is different depending on a choice you make previously practically guarantees at least two playthroughs to get the entire story and even then you'll still miss some modular things which can be done differently. Even though the stakes have escalated as far as the story goes, it's still a story very much grounded in reality except you now get to dabble in politics beyond just a cursory introduction.\n\nIn the end Witcher 2 gets a resounding thumbs up from me. Importing your old Witcher  1 save file is also recommended. Not so much for the imported gear you'll replace fairly quickly so much as for decisions you made previously.","May 25, 2015","true","42.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","3"

A cross between Skyrim and Lord of the Rings, the story is compelling and movie-like. You feel attachment to the characters, and you genuinely care about what will happen to them. The scenery is stunning, the tasks are varied and not repetitive at all, and it keeps you involved right to the end. Yes, the swordsmanship is a little clunky in battle, and it's annoying that you can't change the controls, but these are seriously minor ailments of what is probably my new favourite single player game.

The whole game mechanics and graphics have improve greatly compared to the first game. It's beautiful looking game with a strategic combat mechanics. Yes, as an RPG game, more of the Action RPG side, it have a quality storytelling campaign with a challenging combat. You have to learn how to time your combat rather than just go with a 'typical' mob mentality. It's hard at first but rewarding along the journey. Once you get the rhythm, it will be Dark Souls like kind of enjoyment out of fighting, especially if you ramp up the difficulty. But for people who just want to play it for the stories, just choose the lower difficulty. It's no shame on choosing it, cause you do have to strategise before you enter combat with potions etc.\n\nCampaign wise, it's way wayy better that Witcher 1 for sure, and it's even have two seperate campaign after 1st chapter and its totally different set of environments/quests and you might want to replay the other side of the game later on (keep extra save games for that part). Both set line of quests offer a different agenda rather than just same old RPG style quest that make no different in the end. In Witcher 2, both side have their own agenda and it's up to you which one you like to explore. The sidequest also interesting and most of the time it's not requires too much time to be completed as it is near etc. So pick it up and enjoy the quest.\n\nAlong the way, you will be presented with a lot of choices in term of how your choices affect the game storylines.

The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition starts off with Geralt being detained in dungeon as he was accused for murder of the Temerian King Foltest. He is then interrogated by Vernon Roche, the leader of the Blue Stripes, to tell his part of the story. After persuading Roche, your adventure then begins.\n\nThe game has very much improved in terms of graphics and gameplay. The game's environment and atmospehere is so detailed and very engrossing that just removing the minimap can really get you lost (well, unless you have memorized the area). The soundtracks and voice actings are great. Even if you're just performing sidequests, you'll actually feel that those tasks really matter as if it's as important as the main plot of the game.\n\nOne thing that sets The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings apart from other RPG games is its combat system. Geralt's swordplay is very different and unique. There will be times that hack n' slashing enemies head on could lead to your own demise.\n\nAs you explore the game's world, you'll eventually come into crossroads of decisions and this is The Witcher series strong-point. Just like in the first game, your decisions really matter and affects the flow of the story, the actual ending of the quest and it even affects how the NPCs react to you. Siding with the humans can lead to elf merchants ignoring you and not giving you the service they provide. The decisions you take can either lead to death, a scar on a relationship, a new item, a battle or even a romance scene with one of the girls, etc. The player's decisions shape what kind of personality you want Geralt to portray whether you want him to be a merciful hero, a seeker of justice or just a plain old witcher doing his job.\n\nThe game is quite short with having only 3 chapters (4 in all if you include the prologue) but its immense design on each quest makes the game very long. After your first playthrough, it'll make you want to start all over again as you'll wonder what would have happened if I made this decision instead of the other.\n\nThe Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition is a totally great game that once you finish it, you'll end up looking for more of it. I highly recommend this game to big fans of the Witcher series and to those who really love Action/Adventure RPG games with great story content.\n\nPersonal Rating:Story/Plot: 9/10\nGameplay: 8/10\nMusic: 9/10\nGrapchics: 8/10\n\nOverall: 8.5/10","October 19, 2015","true","49.8"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

If you're looking for someone to sing The Witcher 2's praises, there is nothing for you here. Just downvote me and move on.\n\nAfter spending 31 hours playing this game, I am finding it extremely hard to understand why this game and the developers (CDPR) are seen as some sort of hallowed, sanctified version of perfection and PC development done right. CDPR (and this game specifically) are brought up as a shining beacon almost every time there is a discussion about other devs making stupid decisions (whether it's QTEs in Tomb Raider, or devs not optimizing for the PC platform, etc), and I honestly could not tell you why.\n\nI really tried to like this game. I REALLY did. I played the vanilla version, and when I found the combat to be impossibly clunky and frustrating, I downloaded the Full Combat Rebalance mod, which definitely fixed the combat but unfortunately didn't fix any of the rest of the clunky, frustrating base game.\n\n-The texture work is distractingly disjointed (with awesome high-res textures right next to disgustingly cheap ones). Overall the game looks good, but why put hours and hours into an awesomely-done texture, and then stick it next to an asset ripped from Mario Kart 64?\n-The dialog is well-acted but was recorded at seemingly random volumes. Two characters talking calmly when all of a sudden one of them is talking REALLY REALLY LOUDLY, BUT STILL IN A NORMAL VOICE. It is beyond weird, and ridiculously lazy/shoddy.\n-The story is political intrigue by everyone towards everyone, secretly involving everyone. It gets UNBELIEVABLY tiresome, and you stop being surprised by it halfway through. Twists stop being interesting when that's all there is.\n-Dialog-based intimidation and charm are always successful (at least for me) so there's really no reason for them to even be there.\n-EVERYTHING is pre-scripted. fist-fights are QTEs, story battles that are supposed to be time-based will continue until you kill X number of enemies, and even WALKING THROUGH A DOOR is a scripted event. No loading screen, just stand in front of door and press X, Geralt centers himself against the door, opens it and goes through, and closes it behind him. Repeat for EVERY character! If you have a group of 5 guys, each individual one centers themselves, opens, walks through, and closes. Unimportant, sure, but it is SO HIDEOUSLY STUPID, and would be SO easy to fix.\n-Story fights that need to be repeated over and over and overandoverandoverandover.\n-Speaking of fights: Combat ends up being a slash or two and a sign or two, followed by 27 rolls around the arena while your signs recharge and the enemies un-bunch. Repeat for 40 minutes.\n-You cannot walk freely. You can't jump, and can only climb in pre-ordained places. You can only jump down in pre-ordained places. The whole thing is SUPER stuffy, and this game does NOT deserve to be called "open-world" at all.\n\nUgh, there are so many more things that I could not stand about this game, but I'm done spending time on this "review" so I'll stop.\n\nIf you've made it this far, it's worth saying that the game is not TERRIBLE. If you can put up with its problems, you might enjoy it. I, however, had been lead to think that it was a fantastic world-changing game, and when it turned out to be merely a good game marred by frustratingly stupid design decisions, I was beyond annoyed. Combat was a let-down, the plot was a let-down, movement in the world was a let-down, etc.\n\nI have been a PC gamer all my life. My Dad bought me the full version of Doom when I was 8. I cracked Dark Forces to work without the CD when I was 10. I've played Strife, Ultima Underworld, Wing Commander, Earthsiege & Mechwarrior, Jedi Knight, all the Descents (including both Freespaces), etc.\n\nI have ALWAYS loved the PC, but this latest brand of blind fanboyism just because some dev shows 12% more attention to the platform? I want none of it. Either a game is good because it's good, or it's bad because it's bad. THERE ARE NO OTHER QUALIFYING FACTORS. I wanted to love this game, but I couldn't even like it. 31 wasted hours. Fool me twice, CDPR.","September 28, 2014","false","31.9"," 94 of 173 people (54%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","54","94","173","5","74"

The thing that makes this so good is that not everything is clear, it is not black and white/paragon and renegade actions.\n\nOf my current hours (37.7), I have played within the span of 3 days. It is an addictive and excrutiatingly hard game(on dark difficulty, which I decided to start on) and while the learning curve is quite steep for begginers, it's well worth it.\n\nAlas there are a few cons to every masterpiece, for example, very little carry over from the first Witcher game (coming from a Mass Effect background) and was quite dissapointing that there were very few references to Alvin or any of the major decisions you made (eg. The scoia'tael beating on your ♥♥♥ even if you helped them in the first). Also, I finished the game without any need for the alchemy skill tree, and a lot of tasks such as building the Oathbreakers outfit is long and tedious.\n\nThe lack of big bossfights were a little dissapointing and for me personally, the bosses were too easy (except that damn squid).\n\nHowever, the game makes up for it with breathtaking graphics (especially seeing as it is around 4 years old) and quite fluid combat, along with amazing storytelling elements and interesting plot lines. Although the lore can be boring for some and confusing for others at times as the game attempts to keep you in the dark on various matters.\n\nAll in all, fantastic game.","September 27, 2014","true","64.0"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

It takes what was good from every single RPG released in the last 15 years and makes it into something better. The graphics are simply the best ever seen in an RPG to date, if not the best that we have so far in any game (compare to Crysis if you want to). The flaws are few if any. The stealth sections are not the best, but they are optional, and there are a few bugs and such. There is no ACTUAL character customization, but you can change what the protagonist is wearing with quite a bit.\nThe combat system works quite well. It may not be the best combat system in gaming history, but it does exactly what is is supposed to do. But all that is just beside the point.

Very well made, and thoght out. Is it Skyrim? No. Does it need to be? It never attempeted. This a not so classic rpg in the old school sence. There are no GOOD GUYS and BAD GUYS. There are only sides, ony choices, no one is evil or bad. Just like life. Thats what makes the world and story interesting. It is a novel come to life in video game form. A mature, complicated tale, with ood gameplay to support it.(cause if the gameplay sucked, kinda hard to say its a good game  afterall) .The Witcher 2 is what made me a fan of the seres. Its a bit old school in the sense that it does not hold your hand, which might force you to google a thing or to, but it is well worth it. The action is satisfying, the sound is as it should be.

Yeah!\n\nSome positives---\n1. I like the combat with the varying swords, and steel and silver depending on your opponents. Throw in some magic and it feels balanced.  The combat is better than Witcher 1.  Witcher 1 combat; some people just got fed up with the combat system in the game and stopped playing because of it, sadly missing out on the story in 1.\n2. I like the crafting, you have potions and sword oils to improve your combat and health perks.\n3. The story line is good, it flows and it keeps it's reference to Witcher 1.\n4. The characters are rich with personality! Each character has their own personality.  Elves, Dwarfs, humans, mutants,  monsters have their own environments, attitudes.\n5. Dialog choices are pretty clear, and there are two paths you can take in the game.  It isn't entirely clear whether you are going good, evil or more evil through the game though. However the 2 paths effectively give you 2 different playthroughs, with some side missions available on one path and slight different missions on the other path.\n6. The environments are unique and atmospheric, and feels large enough for the game.\n7. It has Steam Achivements, and for me they are like an added guide to things and directions to take in the game that I might not have otherwise discovered on my own. (there are secret achievements as well)\n8. Merchants are great, they vary on what each sells.  However make sure you don't accidently sell the wrong thing or the buy back will be expensive (save often in case of mistakes)\n9. There is a primary storage location so you don't have to carry all your crap around, and it is maintained in each town as you progress through the chapters.\n10. Will I play it through a second time to experience the other story path? Yes!\n\nSome negatives---\n1. Sometimes the combat for magic is delayed even when mashing it... which causes you to die.  I did a lot of cursing! Read on a forum where one guy said to disable the enhanced features, so I did but it didn't fix it.  Maybe it's a keyboard thing? All I know is I wasn't the only one who experienced it.  And I've got a custom high end machine, and my keyboard is a G11 gaming keyboard.  Regardless the magic works on time sometimes, but not instantly another time. (it's also noted as a bug on some of the forums)\n2. The potion creating system can get tedious and a bit over drawn out, even picking up plants gets annoying with having to click mouse, then move mouse to yeah pick it up and then click again.  It'd be better if it was quick like ES:IV Oblivion, picking up and creating.\n3. No fast travel.. and I would like fast travel (I've read where people say you don't need fast travel because the environments are small enough).  Here's 2 reasons I feel it could use fast travel... 1) the running is like a jog and would be nice if it was faster so give me a sprint option!  I even searched for a way to increase run speed (like you can for FO New Vegas in the console) but couldn't find a way to increase it though.  2) the second reason I'd like fast travel is the map pretty much sucks a$$! If you don't believe me then watch this video another guy created! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bunzBQdB9EI&feature=colike\n4. The map sucks!!! Hire a cartographer for the mapping system, someone who understands the importance of elevations in maps! LOL  Refer to YouTube link above! When you get deep into the game, yep you'll likely start yelling like this guy does in the video listed above. I had to keep going to YouTube/Google to find certain locations... it was really annoying! And when you don't run really fast and you wind up on the other side of town and want to see if the mission is the other way you have to keep going back and forth and back and forth it's annoying! Again a sprint or fast travel would have helped! Luckily in the second playthrough having already found the locations it should be less of a headache to find places.. if I remember where they are.. LOL\n5. The nudity is tacky, plain and simple! LOL  Seriously the make out session with Geralt and Ves, Ves is completely naked makin' like she's banging him but Geralt still has his pants and boots on!? LOL It's a double standard plain and simple, saying it's okay to exploit women but not men. If they are going to have gratuitous sex, that will only appeal to guys who can't get laid in real life then at least make it something like they had in Dragon Age Origins.  I could do without the women are all sl_ts attitude, minus the mages who are apparently b*tches and can't be trusted in this game.\n6. Lastly the Quick Load could use an improvement to the programming and insert an algorithm to speed load times, so it looks for the last created quick save to load instead of reading oldest to newest file then load.  If you save a lot then later in the game your huge save folder will slow load time.  I'm a chronic saver, due to my need to explore dialog options and I accumulated 2 gig of saves in one playthrough. The slow loading can be avoided/fixed by moving a chunk of your oldest saves elsewhere if you find your quick load slowed.  This is a case where it was fast when you started the game but suddenly noticed the load times slowing, towards mid to end of the game.  If it was always slow to load then it's prolly your machine...\n\nDon't let my negatives deter you from buying.  Just be aware it's not perfect! I bought it cheap so no skin off my butt! I'd like to see a Witcher 3, but with my negatives eliminated.. LOL\nThere are also mods here that will enhance the game: http://www.nexusmods.com/witcher2/mods/top/?","February 20, 2014","true","68.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","2"

It is so much better than the first game in my opinion. The story, the gameplay, graphics and most especially, combat, they're all better.\nNow, the game itself is not THAT huge as you might think it is.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/raccoonrinallday/recommended/20920/","raccoonrinallday","Raccoon Rin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/raccoonrinallday/","500 products in account","The Witcher 2 is a game with memorable characters, beautiful towns and landscapes, and a story filled with political intrigue. It's rare to come across a game with choices which feel impactful while avoiding typical 'black and white' or 'good and evil' situations. What lacks in gameplay is made up through the narrative.\n\nThe gameplay is sub-par. Geralt of Rivia is equipped with two swords: one for human-slaying and one for monster-slaying. With magic-like abilities called signs to go along with his swordplay, Geralt is a force to be reckoned with. Dodging and parrying are two important aspects of the combat system. Geralt can die in a moment's notice if the player isn't careful, so it's vital to know when to be aggressive or defensive. However, The combat feels sluggish. The tab-targeting feels unresponsive at times, dodging does not always go the way the players want it to, and contact with enemy units does not feel responsive. A huge plus though is the way a player has to prepare for each encounter. Geralt cannot use potions during combat, only when he is meditating, which a player can do at anytime outside of combat. Potions range from boosting his recovery rates to increasing his attributes and resistances. It's a fairly comprehensive system and adds a layer often missing from other games.\n\nTo level up, the player is given a 'skill tree' to add attribute points to four different categories, each composing of their own active and passive skills: Training, Alchemy, Signs, and Swordsmanship. The leveling up system is not complicated, but the choices you make are important. Geralt can level up to 35, which for example can fill up  the Training Tree and one other. So the player is given the choice of specializing in a certain tree, or become a jack-of-all-trades, balancing their skills points across all areas. It's a simple system which relies on player choice as a main driving force.\n\nThe story is interesting enough to continue unraveling its many mysteries. Geralt meets friends, foes, and backstabbers along the way. What's great is that each character has a sensible motive to their actions. Voice-acting is great and the writing is well-done. The cutscenes do not offer much in terms of action, but the dialogue options and the strive to know more about the characters is enough to justify the more static encounters.\n\nVisually the game is absolutely beautiful. The lighting was and still is the best in the gaming industry. It benefits to take a second and marvel at the scenery surrounding Geralt. The forest around Flotsam, the first town Geralt encounters, is stunning. It helps make the world come alive, and like Mass Effect, creates a very convincing world, as if there's a lot more going on than what Geralt sees in his eyes. The character models, although great, could use some variety. It was common to come across the same character models across various parts of the game.\n\nIf you are a fan of mature-themed RPG adventure, this game ranks among the best of them. It comes highly recommended.","November 25, 2013","true","29.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Badinfos/recommended/20920/","Badinfos","Badinfos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Badinfos/","53 products in account","Time of completion: ~21 hours (68 days total)\nDate of writing the review: 22.February.2015\nDifficulty I played at: Easy (with a little twist, read below for more info)\nMy rating: 7.5/10\n=====================================\nMy review will be separated into different parts covering the many different aspects of the game. First let me give you my overall opinion and if you want you can read about every small detail about it.\n\nThis game is great, I loved it. Unfortunately it suffers from many design flaws, which really make your experience frustrating at times. It seems that the developers didn't learn their lesson too well from the previous game's problems. I had to stop playing for about a month because of how the missions were layed out and the unclear mission markers.\n\nI played it on EASY difficulty, but only used the armor I imported from my "The Witcher 1" save and that armor sucks. I did not use trophies or good trousers or gauntlets. This really gave me a challenge and made the game a lot more enjoyable.\n\nGraphics and performance  I played it on a PC with an i7 4770, GTX 770 and 8GB ram on MAX settings. The performance was perfect. Stable 60 fps in every part of the game. It only dipped to 40-45 fps while exiting out of a cutscene, but it wasn't for more than 3 seconds anyway.\n\nThe loading times are way too long though. The one that really stands out is when you die. After dying it takes a huuuge amout of time for the "reload" text to appear, staying in a black screen for more that 10 seconds. That forced me to constantly quick save so I don't die and have to wait for the black screen to disappear, I reloaded the save before the final blow.\n\nThe graphics at first felt very weird to me. The whole prologue has this yellow overlay and makes the scenery look cartoony and fake. After the prologue is over the graphics look just right. Lots of greenery, beautiful scenery and an amazing view.\n\nStory:   I had no trouble understanding the story of "The Witcher 1", but this one was too much for me. I found it very difficult to follow. I often asked myself: Why does this guy do this ? Why is this here ? Why can't I just do this instead of this and all our troubles will be gone? The multiple choices were great though because I didn't like certain characters in the game and I wanted to see them suffer. Choosing to kill someone instead of saving them gave me the feel that I am in control of Gerald's life and I am not just there for the ride. This opens up the option to replay the game and have a different experience. I will definitely replay the game again in the future.\n\nCombat system A HUGE improvement over the combat system in The Witcher 1 in my opinion. There is just so much more to do than just mashing the left mouse button. You can dodge, parry, set traps, use mutagens to increase your abilities, meditate to drink potions and more. Unfortunately some of these options are completely unnecessary. I never once used a trap and never threw a dagger at someone's face.\n\nThe meditation system is terribly implemented. In order to drink a potion (something which will decide the outcome of the battle) you have to meditate. You can only meditate before a battle and not during it. Then how the hell am I supposed to know when exactly a battle is gonna start ? How can I know when to prepare ? I know it looks more realistic this way, but in my opinion the game suffers because of it. This forced me to constantly quicksave after moving 20 meters because I didn't know when a battle wound start.\n\nControls: The controls are not bad, what annoys me is that one key is used for so many actions. For instance the left mouse button is used to: attack, put out fires, jump down, climb up, talk, open doors and pick up items. I play on a PC, I should have the option to choose, not to have everything on the same key. I often picked up items I didn't want instead of opening a door, or climbed down a ledge instead of picking up an item. This adds to the frustration I mentioned earlier.\n\nFreedom: ... or the lack there of. There is not much freedom in movement. The Witcher 1 suffered from this too. The world is big, but it doesn't feel big at all. There is a pre-determined path you have to walk on. What if I want to go behind this house, or go and see this bush up close ? I can't. The world is very limited in terms of where you can go. Another thing is the ledges. I can't jump down from a half a meter tall ledge without clicking the left mouse button and waiting for Gerald to align himself to the exact spot where he can jump down and wait for an animation. I cannot just jump down from anywhere, no, I have to find the ledge where it says: jump down and then click on it. both TW1 and TW2 suffer from this and really slow down the game play a lot. Speaking of that...\n\nGameplay: This is a story-driven game and unfortunately the gameplay will be constantly interrupted by a cutscene. I swear the cutscenes are so abundant that you can't walk 50 meters before being interrupted by a villager or a dwarf wanting to arm wrestle me. Not much gameplay to be had here. Fortunately the battles and especially the boss battles are very well made and some take a long time to complete without an interruption.\n\nLength: I was really surprised by how short the game felt. That must be because about 40% of the game is cutscenes or dialogue. If felt really short. Even after replaying the first 2 hours, starting from scratch, completing the game, spending an hour or 2 on arena mode, the game still felt very short for some reason. I mean it's 2 times shorter than The Witcher 1 and that game did not have so many cutscenes. ( 39 hours in TW1, 21 hours in TW2).\n\nSide missions: While the first game had very lengthy side mission, which made sence and gave you great benefits after completing them, this one  has none of that. Most (maybe 80%) of the side missions consist of: kill X number of enemies in this area and bring me proof, or win X number of arm wrestling contests, or win X number of dice poker games. Speaking of which, dice poker was my favorite distraction in TW1, in this one the dice are way too dark and hard to see, the symbols on them are almost identical, so I avoided playing it, that's unfortunate because I really loved that mini-game in TW1.\n\nOther small nit-picky things, which didn't fit anywhere else: + Boobs: You will see boobs, lots and lots of boobs. You will see and touch at least 5 pairs of boobs, if you search for them, you might get to see even 10 pairs.\n\n- Mission markers: Very difficult to determine where exactly they are. Often you will be standing on one, only to figure out that it is several floors below you. Now you have to find another way to get to it. Even games from 2002 had mission markers that indicated if the objective is above of below you and actually made sense (GTA Vice City)\n\n- Vergen: There is this city in Chapter 2 that has the worst layout ever. I am willing to bet that about an hour and a half of my playtime was spent trying to figure out how to get to a lower lever or find where exactly the mission marker is located. This chapter made me stop playing for about a month because of how annoying the layout of the city was.\n\n=================================================\nThere is more to talk about, but I will leave it here because I ran out of characters. If you have questions then ask away, I will answer everybody. That's it for the review, I recommend the game, I paid 4 euro for it on the summer sale, but would not buy it for full price. The game definitely does not deserve the "best RPG ever" award and does not even come close to it. It is highly overrated and does not deserve a score higher than 7.5/10.\nPlease play The Witcher 1 first, it was incredible and this one is a downgrade from the original.","February 22, 2015","true","23.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","6","7","2","1"

It's a flawed gem of a game and one that could well have been one of the best RPG's ever made, if it wasn't for one thing: the combat. The combat is either shallow and dreadfully easy on "Easy", or absolutely impossible on "Normal". "Normal" is really hard mode and they need another difficulty in-between.\n\nPutting that aside, pretty much everything else in the game is good. Graphically it looks very pretty when maxed out for a game this old.\n\nHaving never played Witcher 1, I found it's not very beginner friendly with regards to the story - but then I kind of expected that anyway. Nevertheless, if you have not played the previous game, expect to be confused... a lot. When you finally get your head round it you will find it has significant depth and is highly engaging.\n\nYour companions all have back stories of their own and they are well fleshed out. Not many games have had me caring for characters I have only spent a minimal amount of time with in game, but this one got me!\n\nThe RPG elements are solid and allow for quite a bit of customisation. It has an interesting potion mechanic, based on your "toxicity level", so you can't just swig every potion you have before a fight.\n\nSo, all in all, it's a good game. It could have been brilliant if a few issues were resolved. Regardless of which, it has made me want to get Witcher 3 this February, so consider me hooked!\n\nJimbo Rating: 7/10","January 8, 2015","true","9.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

If you are looking into buying this game, go onto t"The Witcher" youtube channel and watch the small little overview they offer about the first game. Onto the actual review, this is easily one of the best RPGs out there on the market at this time. The graphics are absolutely stunning and run quite smoothly, the artwork and textures are brilliant and vibrant, yet bleak enough to preserve the game's "feel". Speaking of feel, this game has a dark, mature attitude full of corruption and disgust. The moral choices in the game require Geralt to make morally ambigious decisions. There are no rights or wrongs, only decisions based on the scenarios. Combat can be best described as playing Dark Souls with a character who doesn't weigh 450 pounds, fun, but challenging as well. The plot has enough turns to keep things flowing, but it's not ridiculous. Plenty of sexual encounters. To conclude, I rate the game as a strong 9/10, and highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good game. I got 60 hours out of it and bought it for 2.50.","April 18, 2015","true","114.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I will cover all levels of the\ngame, graphics, story, combat etc.\n\nI will start off with the story that is being told. As someone who loves a\ndeep immersive story and world this game is a delight. The characters are\nall well voiced and feel like they have a lot invested in the world as well\nas them not appearing to be cardboard cut outs just conveying the next\nplot entry to the player. You have to make choices in the Witcher 2. Which\nfor those of you who played the first will find a bit urking if you enjoyed\ntaking the Witcher path (neutrality). However the stakes are greatly raised\nin the sequel. The fate of the entire northern realm is being decided and\nyour choices as Geralt will have long term ramifications on the world.\n\nThis is the only game I have ever had to sit back, get up out of my\nchair and weigh the pros and cons of my decision. I have never felt\nmore invested in a series than the Witcher series. It is such a believable\nworld, so well crafted with so much attention to detail and love it is\nunmissable. The story is exciting, if it does feel over a bit too soon. In\nmy 2nd playthrough I played on normal, did just about everything you\ncould do with some additional grinding out levels etc and that took me\nabout 45 hours. Where as my Witcher 1 play through took me 60+.\nThat being said the enhanced edition of the game that I played for the\nfirst time since the games original launch has added a lot of content\nand interesting things that make the game a bit more fleshed out to\ngive players a bit more of a satisfying conclusion leading up to the\nthird game.\n\nThe graphics to be honest are still the best we have seen on the PC.\nI believe that if they released a brand new game (story, combat etc)\nwith the existing engine everyone would still be blown away. The fact\nthat CD Projekt said "Nah its not good enough" and created a new\nengine for the Witcher 3 is insane especially by todays standard of\nlazy ♥♥♥ developers copy and pastaing as many god damn games as\nthey can to meet their annual release schedule (♥♥♥♥ you Call of Duty\nand Battlefield) is a breath of fresh air in a stagnant market. I bought\na 980 superclocked for the Witcher 3, and I can't even run Witcher 2\nwith ubersampling (I don't even think it does anything other than\ncater to the egos of nerds with quad titan blacks) but other than that\nI can ultra this game at 80-100 FPS constantly at 1080p. The game\nis absolutely beautiful, the textures the character models. Everything\nis picture esque. It is the exact thing we pc gamers love to see. Detail.\n\nNow onto Combat. As a fan of the original games fighting style ala\nJedi Knight esque "stances" combat which I know a lot of people hate\nbecause it can come down to just button clicking at the right time. I\ninitially hated the Witcher 2 combat, it was sluggish and felt rather\nconsolized. After 4 years passed I picked the game up again now that\nthe enhanced edition has improved combat it feels much more\nresponsive and fun. Even if it still feels to be a bit of a "Roll fest". I\ndo feel that combat still needs improvements to make it more\ninteresting, a hybrid of one and twos combat systems could work\nout incredibly well and make the game feel unique in its own right.\nThat being said the combat has been improved and I have heard\nthere are mods that made the combat even better.\n\nI have a lot of love for this game and for this series. I think that\nCD Projekt red has proved themselves among the best developers\nof games to this day. Their mentality is that of the days of old.\nWhen people who loved games, made games. It wasn't a day\nto day job. It was done with passion and commitment. You can\ntell CD loves their IP, and their franchise. Their commitment\nto their fans has been something truly admirable. They give\nfree content out that most companies would charge a boat load\nfor. Most of you would say "Well that's nothing special they should\ndo that anyway" I agree with you in theory but that is not the\npoint. The point is they do not HAVE TO, but they DO. They\ncare about the people who play their games. That is why I\nlove them and am eagerly awaiting The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt.\n\nThis game is a must if you love RPG's. It is an absolute must.\n9/10\n","May 18, 2015","true","53.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Err, I Mean The Combat.Genre: 3rd Person Western RPG, In-Depth Conversation System with Combat.\nDeveloped & Published by: CD Projekt RED\nPlatform Support: Windows, Mac, Linux and Consoles.\nBusiness Model: Base Game\nCopy purchased by myselfRead the full & unabridged review on A Paladin Without A Crusade[kingisaaclinksr.com]\n\nPreamble and Disclosure\nRPGs are a difficult genre of game to review. With their vast worlds to explore, hours of gameplay that measure into the 50s or 100s for a single run through and each experience guaranteed to be different, well, it can be challenging to say the least. Laying my cards on the table, I played The Witcher 2 at hard difficulty for one playthrough. I did another playthrough at normal difficulty but only got part way through. I believe those two campaigns have given me enough experience to create my thoughts for this review. The Witcher 2 was purchased on Steam by myself, two years ago. Yeah, it has been that long. So, without further ado, I present A Paladin’s Thoughts and Review of The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings: Enhanced Edition. 3rd person RPG for Windows, Mac, Linux and Consoles.\n\nOverall Gameplay Thoughts\nOne half of the game is having a lot of long conversations with multiple NPCs. Participating in said conversations allows for world building, acquiring side-quests, trading and/or participate in….distractions.  These are generally well fleshed out conversations and you can skip a lot of lore if you want. There’s also different conversation options that can influence the responses you’ll get. It’s not as black and white as say Mass Effect’s paragon/renegade system. Instead, it generally influences how diplomatically Geralt will approach a situation. You can also use signs or intimidation to influence the conversation to your liking, provided you’ve leveled them up enough. The other half of the game is looting materials & personal possessions from every house, building, cave and castle Geralt can get into. Right from under people’s very noses. It’s insane how often Geralt is able to just steal from nobles or kings. Hehe ok, the actual other half is the combat system. It’s a fast paced hack-and-slash system that tries to encourage tactical and quick thinking as well as planning ahead. While it is possible to avoid some fights, usually by choosing the right response or avoiding a quest altogether, it’s not possible to avoid the majority of it.\n\nStory Thoughts\nMany of the characters are an unlikable lot. There are very few good guys and Geralt isn’t one of them. It feels like a lot of attention was given to Geralt, Iorveth and Vernon and the rest were mostly regulated to side arcs or doomed to two-dimensionality. Despite TW2’s attempts to subvert tropes, many characters still follow many traditional tropes and stereotypes. After all, it’s kind of hard to find characters surprising when they’re given such obvious names like Dandelion, Triss Merigold or worse: Deathmold. I mean, really? Deathmold was the best name you could up with for an evil villain? Why not just have him give us an over the top laugh when we meet him? It would have been more subtle. Everyone else is pretty easy to figure out once you meet them. They rarely stray from their outward appearance and are largely predictable. There was little attempt to justify some of the heinous acts committed by evil people. They just did it because that’s what the universe expected.\n\nThe Combat System\nThe combat system seems to be designed for tactical and lethal swordplay. It rewards prepared Witchers and punishes mistakes and overconfidence. Getting yourself surrounded by the enemy will lead to a quick death while setting up traps and oils will result in a lot of dead enemies. It doesn’t help that Geralt is often outnumbered by enemies. So, he’ll need to use all of his kit in each encounter to survive. 1v1 fights are very rare in this game. Though I wish they hadn’t been. While every fight has different enemies and somewhat different attacks, I found that I had to deal with them all in basically the same way. With lots of dancing, rolling and quick poking into enemies when you can. Occasionally using a sign or bomb, hoping all the while that Geralt’s health doesn’t get nicked to death. It’s too repetitive to be ignored and towards the end of the game, well, it’s just a tiresome chore.\n\nPC Settings & Port Report\nThe Witcher 2 still looks impressive after all these years. There’s a decent amount of variety in locations, character models, rich weapon & armor designs, flora, buildings, you get my point. The realistic style TW2 went for is consistent with nothing looking out of place. However, the cracks are beginning to show and I can’t ignore them. Texture quality is all over the place. Geralt and other main characters can have impressive looking armor or clothing. Take a glancing look at some other people though and you start to see some gnarly texture quality. Heck, there were some textures not far off the beaten path that looked incomplete, missing or bugged out entirely. They seemed to have a hard time keeping a consistent quality at any point, which can pull you out of the world. Worse still is the view-distance. Even at max settings, pop-in is a constant problem. Foliage being the worst offender of popping in right in front of you. Combined with character models sometimes being a bit old looking and I suspect this will lead to problems in the future. That’s if we ignore a number of animation glitches, visual clipping and others. I think that TW2 will start to age just as poorly as the first Witcher has in the coming years. It’s still not a bad looking experience for now, and a lot of these issues aren’t major, but it will add up over time.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nIf you’re up for a fantasy story with a solid adventure, political intrigue and interesting conversations, The Witcher 2 is certainly good for it. However, it comes with some major problems that are hard to ignore. Character’s are often two dimensional. The combat system is overly difficult and punishing even on Normal mode. Not to mention, the difficulty curve can swing wildly from fight-to-fight, especially if you install the combat overhaul mod. I’m finding it harder and harder to recommend story-based games with poor combat systems. I think it’s long overdue that devs pay equal attention to both the story & combat so that each are enjoyable to experience. I give this a very hesitant recommendation. It gets that for what the devs attempted. The Witcher 2 tried to go big and very nearly succeeded. Given more time for polish, I think this truly would have been a remarkable game.

It's a flawed gem of a game and one that could well have been one of the best RPG's ever made, if it wasn't for one thing: the combat. The combat is either shallow and dreadfully easy on "Easy", or absolutely impossible on "Normal". "Normal" is really hard mode and they need another difficulty in-between.\n\nPutting that aside, pretty much everything else in the game is good. Graphically it looks very pretty when maxed out for a game this old.\n\nHaving never played Witcher 1, I found it's not very beginner friendly with regards to the story - but then I kind of expected that anyway. Nevertheless, if you have not played the previous game, expect to be confused... a lot. When you finally get your head round it you will find it has significant depth and is highly engaging.\n\nYour companions all have back stories of their own and they are well fleshed out. Not many games have had me caring for characters I have only spent a minimal amount of time with in game, but this one got me!\n\nThe RPG elements are solid and allow for quite a bit of customisation. It has an interesting potion mechanic, based on your "toxicity level", so you can't just swig every potion you have before a fight.\n\nSo, all in all, it's a good game. It could have been brilliant if a few issues were resolved. Regardless of which, it has made me want to get Witcher 3 this February, so consider me hooked!\n\nJimbo Rating: 7/10","January 8, 2015","true","9.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Building on the amazing story which started with the first Witcher game, considered a classic by many, Witcher 2 also improves the experience of being a professional monster-slayer. The combat is challenging and realistic ( no chugging fifty potions in the middle of a fight :P ) and the visuals and voice acting are excellent, and the story as aforementioned is gripping filled with impactful choices, characters that you will grow to love and others whom you'll want to introduce to a witcher's blade.\n\nFor those who have played the Witcher 3 Wild Hunt and want to immerse yourself more in the witcher world but find the first witcher to have not aged particularly well Witcher 2 Assassins of KIngs is an excellent game detailing Geralt's adventures leading upto the events of Wild Hunt.\n\nOverall an amazing RPG and good entry point for those who have never played a Witcher game as well as returning monster-slayers.","February 6","true","35.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

First of all its hard as hell, thats not necessarily a knock against the game itself but for a casual gamer it surpasses challenging and crosses into the realm of frustrating. The story is compelling but it doesnt draw you(me) in and the characters are kind of bland. Quests are sometimes unessarily confusing (i.e. follow this blood trail....multiple irrelevant blood trails) I would still reccomend this game to rpg players because its well made and has a lot to love (Graphics, intuitive crafting, super customizable player etc.) just not for me personally.","May 30","true","48.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

It's pushing bounderies on how a sword fighting game can be handled. I haven't played another game that so well binds melee fighting with alchemy and sorcery. The three and like the legs of a tripod for successfull advancing in Witcher 2. It's also one of the hardest games out there, mistakes in battle are unforgiving and depending on what choices you make you can have 2 completely different playing experiences.\n\nBelow are some pros and cons:\n\nPros\n+ The game is unique in many features.\n+ You actually need to combine magic, alchemy and fighting to be successful.\n+ Geralt is more of a brute and not such a playboy as he was in the first game.\n+ The difficulty of this game is way beyond your usual RPG.\n+ Water looks the best I’ve seen anywhere in games\n+ Might be the most tactical swordfighting game. Bombs, signs, traps, oils, potions + the right weapon - there's so much to take into account before going to battle.\n+ Complex and interesting story with memorable characters.\n\nCons\n- Under Mac the game crashes on reload almost every time. The game crashes a lot under Windows as well but much less than under Mac.\n- Mac issue: whereas the game doesn’t take that long to load, it takes ages for the load screen to come up.\n- Poor optimizing of graphics. With max settings the game is an artistic masterpiece, yet it takes a great computer to run full graphics. For some reason Witcher looks a little better in Windows than in Mac.\n- Looting takes time and precision.\n- The game get's easier as you play, a lot easier. Also, the gaps between difficulties are extremely jumpy, going from\ndying in 10 seconds to not getting a scratch.\n- The city of Vergen was a navigational nightmare, a maze in it's worst form.\n- There's a weird delay at the end of the sword swinging move that starts to feel painful in battles, especially when you wanna hit and dodge.\n\nVerdict:\n\nI highly recommend this game, it's a positive challenge and highly original. There were few things that bugged me, most of them had to do with optimization, but I'm completely ready to forgive them all for the outstanding work of art that was built.","December 30, 2014","true","91.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

On the other the story ending seems extremely rushed, a 4th act would have made this from a great game to an instant classic.\n\nThe story continue to be amazing however the use of "ploughing" nagged me something awfull.\nThe Combat is by far the best of all 3 games, being challeging and so bloody rewarding that forced me to change style multiple times in the game in order to become just that little bit more effective which makes it even more rewarding when beating each challenge that geralt faces. The first and epsecially the third games don´t do this to nearly as great an effect imo.\n\nThe alchemy system is not nearly as good imo with potions and especially oil lasting wayyy to short cause of a bloody upgrade tree :< i will take my aard and igni upgrades thank you\n\ngrachics are still extremely good even 4 years down the line however it seems that cd-red took of bit more than they could chew with quite the few grapichs glitches even in the "enhanced edition"\nWhich just leaves me with my biggest complaint! Since i don´t want to spoil the story i will just say the ending(s) feel super rushed and it´s just one gaint infodump that leads up to a gaint war that in the witcher 3 isn´t played up nearly as much making it super anti-climatic. Also as i said the game really could have gone with a 4th act as the games ending again feels aprupt.\n\nNote: if all you want is the sex scenes, youtube it cause its just the most awkward thing to watch 3d models rub against eachother-.-\n\nNote 2: this game is quite a bit shorter than the witcher 1 and 3 as seen here:\nWitcher 1: 50 hours (50% of sidequests)\nWitcher 2: 30 hours (about 60-70% sidequests)\nWitcher 3: err im at 182 hours atm and i think at 100% (this game is soo ♥♥♥♥ing good)\n\nLets grade it:\nStory: B+\nCombat: A+\nGraphics: B\nValue for money (19.99 euro): A\n\nOverall Grade: A (Must buy)","June 12, 2015","true","31.5"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

The action-RPG's a unique one, having been developed by CDProjekt Red, a Polish dev company bringing us a real prideful offering as to how a western action-RPG presents itself on the global stage.\n\nUnique in what regards?\n\nPositive:\n\nW2 has plenty of choices in the story arc, even outside the main forks in the road such as Roche's path, or Iorveth's path, there's certianly multiple ways to handel meeting up with bosses, and other key plot points. There's ways to close/not initiate certian mission b/c of xyz, so I sugest watching the "Changing Locations" vid from the devs on the multiple stories. W2 is indeed practically 1.5 games in 1.\n\nThe dialogue trees fill a convergence in the emersiveness and gets away with some pecilular takes on the cast's rogueish attitudes, Geralt picking up on chicks, the dice minigame, midevil slang, such as bugger, wh0r3son, ba$tard, all terms you don't really hear in the modern Americas, but used in Scottland, the UK, and such, however b/c this is a myere'd and dark time, synergysticaly it all plays to the story.\n\nNegative:\n\nThe combat can be handled via simple mash to progress, however if you get into the rolling and dodgeing, you can fine tune your fighting tactics. Geralt's the archetypical battlemage w/ rather straightforward skilltrees for wizardry, and alchemy, however his swordplay and dodgeing whilst in combat are his coup de' grass. The skilltree progressions are linear, un-complicated, and arguabley a bit of a toss. Wizardy allows you to throw spells at a one shot per meter rate in battle, giving enemies status effects such as catching fire, while the alchemy tree has you crafting interesting potions that, unfortunately, can only be used just before the battle commences.\n\nThe weapon/armor progression system's unique in an unfavorable way in regards to the story's tendancy to branch meaning you can miss a NPC needed that would have given you quests, or items, or even find yourself in custody, or in a dundgeon, and if you didn't explore it just right, you will lose your confiscated gear.\n\nW2's submenu's and UI are still difficult to nagivage, and aren't user friendly, however they're mods to it.\n\nWitcher 2 has a modding community as well, w/ game dev's even adding to the combat w/ advances from Witcher 3.\n\nWitcher 2 Multiple Paths Trailer: "Changing Locations"\n\nhttp://www.gametrailers.com/videos/1utzna/the-witcher-2--assassins-of-kings-enhanced-edition-exclusive-changing-locations-trailer\n\nWitcher 2 Offical Dev's "Unofficial Combat Mod" w/ aspects in combat from the upcoming Witcher 3\n\nhttp://redkit.cdprojektred.com/index.php?c=mod&m=show&p=77","February 14, 2014","true","162.2"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","1"

You still can combo them down with a combination of spells,rolls and attacks,which puts it high on my list of games with good combat-alongside Shadow of Mordor and the ever mentioned Batman Arkham series.\n\nGreat game,recommend to anyone who didn't play it,though would help a bit if you played the first one to understand the lore behind it a bit more,but not absolutely necessary.","May 11","true","45.5"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","7","10","2","0"

It has its great moments, but also some very lame sides. First, the positive things about this game: It is a nicely done rpg with lots of costumization possibilities. You can not travel between cities and have to follow the plot of the game, but once you're in a city, you are free to explore it however you want to. There are lots of side quests and the main plot itself is very interesting. The side quests are also meaningful and mostly fund, not of the "fetch me this flowe" kind. The game is clearly made for adults, since there's a lot of brutality and nudity in it. This is nice to see in an era where almost every game is being made for all audiences. The crafting system is also one of the strong features of Witcher 2. You can craft weapons, armor, potions, traps etc.\nOn the other hand, there are some things which ruin the game. The checkpoint (aka autosave) system is a failure. You watch a cutscene, you listen to a conversation and then get to the fight scene. If you die, you don't get to fight again immediately; no you have to watch the cutscene again (which you can skip btw) and listen to the conversation (which you can click through). It is very annoying to constantly have to click your way to the fight after every death and it only adds to your frustration. There are also instances in the game where you don't control your main character, but you are rather given the control of a character in the story to fight. The game is almost telling you "Hey remember all those skills you gained through collecting experience and all? Yeah, they're gone. Have fun!". This is very very frustrating. In the end, you should make up your mind: can you endure the frustration of this game to enjoy its exciting plot and positive features?\n\ntl;dr Witcher 2 is a beautiful game with some very annoying bull**** in it.","May 25, 2014","true","61.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You can import your character from witcher 1 into witcher 2. If you do import your character, there are some differences, as well as some gear that transfers from witcher 1. They have improved several aspects overall. Combat system is much more engaging and lively. Button smashing is not enough to get through. You need to explore different strategies so that you don't get swarmed with monstors. Use potions, oils and signs effectively to stay alive. Graphics are very impressive. Inventory management is changed as well. Instead of having a certain number of inventory slots, now there's a weight limit like most RPGs. From what I can understand Witcher 2 didn't have a storage option earlier but they added it into the Enhanced Edition.\n\nIn general character development is similar to that of witcher 1. You can focus on alchemy, swordsmanship, or magic (signs). Although you do have several different abilities that can be purchased. One noticable difference is that you can directly make use of mutagens harvested from monsters and use them to enhance your armor, attack, sign intensity, critical effects, vitality etc.\n\nKudos to CD Projekt Red for releasing the Enhanced Edition at no additional cost for those who already owned witcher 2. This is a large improvement over the original witcher 2 since it adds multiple side-quests, cut-scenes, improved graphics, storage option etc.\n\nI believe this is the 4th time I'm playing the game. Unlike witcher 1, where you could've remained neutral and avoid game politics more or less, Geralt finds himself being dragged into politics. There's no avoiding it in this game. There are two main paths you can follow and each offers very different quests and it makes the game playable several times without feeling repetitive. Similar to witcher 1, there is no absolute evil nor absolute good. There are no right or wrong choices. Only the consequences of your choices. The story is fantastic and excellent voice acting.\n\nThe game is divided into 3 chapters, other than the prologue and the epilogue. You have to make the biggest choice you're going to make in this game at the end of chapter 1. Thus the chapters 2 and 3 are completely different depending on your choice. You also have to make several other choices along the way which affects the story more or less. If you played witcher 1 (and you should), you would understand the situation much better. But at the same time, it's not necessary to enjoy this game as it offers an excellent story itself.\n\nBottom line is that this game is a must have for RPG fans. It is a huge improvement from witcher 1, which was an excellent game. So that is saying a lot. Looking forward to witcher 3 next February!","June 5, 2014","true","25.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

If you liked the original The Witcher, definitely get this one.\n\nI found the original The Witcher an intriguing but very confusing mess of a game. Even with the release of the Eanhanced Edition of the original I could not get into it because nothing in the game made eny sense to me.\n\nEnter The Witcher 2 (:Assassins and all that stuff I'm too lazy to type out each time). Here is a game that throws you into the deep end of a non-conventional RPG mechanic, as well as a lore-rich story that will most likely be very unfamiliar and quite foreign to most players. And yet the game presents itself in a way that draws you into the story and lore, and teaches you just enough about its game mechanics to get you confortably started, but lets out enough detail to make you feel like you're getting better at it as you start to fine-tune your approach to the game.\n\nEven though the story and lore can be seen as very standard fare fantasy at a glance, I advise any player to take the time to read up in the Journal to learn more about the characters, events, locations and monsters. You'll quickly see that this is not just another Middle-Earth clone, and the quality of the lore leans much more heavily towards the Game of Thrones class of fantasy world. People are driven my human desires, and no-one in the game is an idealistic representation of virute. In this world, no-one is perfect.\n\nThen you get to the gameplay anr RPG mechanics. Yes, you have skill trees you advance through to earn new and better skills and abilities. But the game leans heavilty toward strategic planning for each fight you're going to face. Drink potions and apply temporary enhancements to your equipment to give you the edge you'll need to survive. You're not playing a standard RPG here where your character is basically a demi-god able to wade through armies of enemy troops at a whim. You may be a mutant bred for slaying monsters, but you're still very much human, and very much mortal, so you better put some thought into what the world is going to throw at you so that you can meet it prepared.\n\nWhen combat erupts, things hardly go exactly according to plan though, which forces you to improvise within the general planning you had laid down. You have a wide selection of Signs (spells) and items at your disposal to help keep the odds in your favour. Drop  some traps during a fight to snare up your enemies, trow bombs to stun and damage as you hack away, and even use mind control to tun an enemy against his mates and tip the scales.\n\nOne of the things I found hardest to comprehent in the original The Witcher was the combat system. I can beilieve that it was a brilliant system, but I just never felt comfortable with it. In The Witcher 2, the combat is redone completely, feels much more action-packed and impressive than the original.\n\nThe game also forces you to go through certain choices that influence the game as you progress. And unlike other "morality-based" games, there is never a clear-cut definition of which choice is the "good" and which is the "bad". You need to make up your own mind, because the the world of The Witcher 2, things work in shades of grey, and nothing is Black & White (see what I did there?)\n\nAll in all, I highly recomment this game. I bought it on special during the Holiday 2014 Sale, because I wasn't too impressed with the original, but after playing it for a few hours I'd gladly pay full price for it.\n\nWell done, CD Projekt RED.

I know I for one have been disappointed with many offerings in the ARPG genre, but The Witcher series has done alot to win my interest back to a once shining section of the video game world. There is a lot too this game, while I feel its not for me to break down all the flaws and finesse's of the sequel to The Witcher, I will point out that you will be hard pressed to find another game anything like it in its lore. In fact, everything in The Witcher is different from the normal; from a very interesting system progression system to the combat mechinics (which come with a fairly steep curve for those who havent the patience to learn the practice it takes to time blows and parries). There is alot to like about this game. I've come only to write this "Review" to tell you that if you havent tried this series out dont worry, The Witcher 2 story brings new players in nicely without making it feel patched into the story. Other than that, this is a AAA rpg that has added the action combat element near flawlessly. Its got its kinks and there are some questionable interface choices but really Im nit picking because there isnt a whole lot to complain about. Just buy the game. Its worth your dollars if your a fan of fantasy rpg with action combat. The difference here is the difficulty isnt insulting and the depth is rewarding. Get the damn game, okay?","January 6, 2015","true","18.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The biggest positive of this game is it's non linearity- there are many difficult choices that we will have to make. Second chapter of the game looks completly different depending on our previous decisions. The story is pretty decent, just a bit "too political" in my opinion, but all those movie-like cutscenes are downright gorgeous. It just makes it really easy to feel involed in what's going on. Combat is ok, sort of a tactical hack & slash. It's up to us whether we'll help ourselves with magical signs, traps, potions or with little of everything. The only two flaws that I can think of is difficulty arch (game is hard at the beggining and gets quite easy later), and the fact that it could really be longer. Takes 20+ hours to finish the main story, and 30+ hours to finish it with all the side quests. But still I think it's a great game and I'd recommend it to anyone who likes action RPGs.","May 20, 2015","true","31.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Anyone playing Crusader Kings 2 will feel like they are playing a minor hero character in a big world of politics and schemes. It is brutal world, a beautiful, brutal world! The story continues from the first game and puts Geralt in a messy messy time full of troubles. This game was released same year as Dragon Age 2 and Skyrim. It is probably not as big and as long as these two but I think it out perform Dragon Age 2 with flavour and story, I care more for the characters in Witcher 2 than those in Dragon Age 2. In Dragon Age 2 I wanted to kill them. In Skyrim I did not care even that much about NPCs and many places felt very empty. The Witcher is a very gorgeous game.\n\nAs I said before the combat is not my favourite but I can see if people prefer this over the more unique Witcher 1 combat system. The sound is good and the voice actors are in my opinion very good. The models also come in more flavours this time compared to Witcher 1. It feels a bit shorter than Witcher 1 but comes with a big replayability with the a split in the road. I do hope that all your options, Kill A, Let A go, Save X over Z, Help Nr 1 and fight Nr 2. I hope these options have consquences in Witcher 3.\n\nThe game is not perfect but to consider what a failure the big guys at Bioware itself released this year and how they continued to release overrated games with plenty of flaws, it is hard then to judge this Polish studios struggles. It is a excellent  game in a grim world! Showing the darkness of humanity and the chaos errupting from a dead king. Resembling the chaos in Europe in the middle ages in a bit. It is a grim bloody world, full of prejudice, hate, treachery and  destruction. But also lot of comeraderie, courage and love shown. 9 out of 10.\n\nTrigger Warning: It is not a game for you SJW wimps! Go play Dragon Age Inquisition with you.","March 28, 2015","true","31.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's not a rush game (where you kill and proceed) in this game you have to dodge, parry and barrel roll and then strike.  The fighting mechanism is more like dodge until you find a great opportunity to strike and prepare before you go into combat (drinking potions, use poison ETC).\n\nThe cons though would be the "target select mechanism" because when you're fighting a lot of enemys, the character "Geralt" attacks (often) the nearest enemy pointed in the direction you're looking at, and also when you have a companion the enemys rather attack your companion than you (which makes the game a lot easier).\n\n8/10 IMO","July 22, 2014","true","50.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Also Letho for the badass character he was I think it deserved a bit of more an highlight throughout the game, you just get to know more and see more of Letho at the ending but again that's probably the way how the game ended abruptly.\nBut it was a really good game overall.","September 3, 2014","true","45.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","3"

Visually it's absolutely beautiful. The story and the lore are great, there's a branching path which makes the game play differently, there's no "right" and "wrong"... But the actual game itself, as a game with its technicalities and mechanics, falls short of my expectations.\n\nThe user interface is confusing, and not only because there are no tooltips:\n\nThe only witcher sign whose purpose I could remember was Igni, because it burned things.\n\nInventory management is a mess; they have tried simplifying it compared to the first game, but again, without any tooltips, the only sorting options I figured out were "by newest obtained" and "by most weight". The others... I have no idea what they're about.\n\nThe character skill tree won't list where mutagen slots are located. I've talked to a couple of people who played the game, and they all mutated their first ability with something stupid. You can't remove the mutagen, so you're stuck with that choice until the end of the game. If you're reading this, don't do it until you're absolutely sure that you chose correctly, because it won't be surprising if you used a lesser mutagen and got a greater mutagen five minutes later.\n\nYou have to decide early on which path to take: magic, alchemy, swords. Not enough talents to push all three branches.\n\nLooting is a problem, as there is no "highlight loot" key, and there are no labels. If a corpse leaves more than 4 things to be looted, you won't see them until you enter the loot window. Positioning the character to loot items and rotating the camera is too hard.\n\nThe map is confusing, especially if you're outside a city. Sometimes it seems you can go a certain way to get somewhere, but it's blocked by some bushes and you have to go back and find an alternate route. You can't leave markers, nor is everything on the map marked: for example, in Flotsam I found a book merchant in a random house.\n\nBuying weapons/armor from merchants doesn't let you compare stats to items you own.\n\nYou can get good items by crafting diagrams, but you have to find someone to craft; Geralt can't do it. He can just make potions. I actually had to use pen and paper to write down what I want and what I need to craft it.\n\nSpeaking of potions - you can't drink them during a battle. You have to do it before, but... How are you supposed to know you'll be in battle? Some people like it, some don't, but for most, if they desire challenging combat, it'll be a case of "save often, reload often".\n\nEventually I dropped down to easy difficulty, stopped caring about my inventory, looting, oils, potions, bombs and all of that, and just concentrated on the story and the quests. Before that, I was fighting the game itself, instead of monsters.\n\nAnd the game became fun.\n\nIf you want a deep story - go for it. If you want perfect and streamlined game mechanics, go for it still, but you might want to do what I did.\n\nRecommended anyway. Looking forward to the third game!","December 22, 2013","true","33.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I bought it in the sale thinking "♥♥♥♥ it I'll give it a shot", and my only regret is that I didn't buy it earlier. The combat system is massively improved. Quite a lot of 3rd person action games should take note, because THIS GAME IS BRILLIANT.\n\nIf you're undecided about buying the game like I was, stop thinking, and buy it while it's on sale (though I'd have been happy to pay full price if I'd realised how damn good it is).\n\nIf that doesn't sell it to you, you must be one of these sad freaks who's scared of hearing a bit of colourful language...","December 2, 2013","true","13.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","2"

It doesn't feel right.\n- Unbalanced gameplay mechanics - Oils and potions barely last long enough to be of any use, and forcing you to drink them in meditation mode is tiresome. Also fairly unrealistic and breaks immersion somewhat. Many skills over/underpowered (i.e. dodge-roll, shield sign, alchemy tree etc.)\n-Clunky UI and menus. Bad sorting options, unintuitive selection design (i.e. hover over recipe with mouse cursor, then press space or enter to complete recipe. but don't click and make sure not to move your mouse away from recipe in list). The map, while looking totally freaking awesome, is almost entirely useless. Many more problems with UI.\n-Lack of camera controls and options.\n-Unclear or non-existent tutorials.\n-Also, doors. OMG DOORS. Another obvious piece of the game programmed with the fortcoming console port in mind.\n\nOverall. 6/10.

This isn't a great game, it's a good one. It has numerous flaws. Ridiculous boss fights (thank goodness for easy mode), stupid missions with auto fail conditions (I nearly was reduced to tears by one idiotic sequence where you had to follow someone through a greyscale cave where the mission was restarted if you put one foot wrong), display and path finding glitches, and a bizarre plot that lost me some time ago. But it also has much goodness - smashing combat, once you figure out you have to roll a lot, stunning visuals, a fantastic main character and decent supporting cast, including several strong female characters - don't be deceived by the pandering to teenage boys with the top heavy character models. There is action aplenty and a reasonable amount of exploration to do, however I feel it didn't live up to it's predecessor and it does feel curiously amateurish in places. I really have no idea how this devteam is going to pull off something as ambitious as Witcher 3, but I'll certainly be playing it. Recommended? Yes, but with the caveat that the game is deeply flawed and a definite slog at times.","September 5, 2014","true","33.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Controls are tight using the 360 gamepad, combat could be described as well timed button mashing, while everything else is very responsive. Having 27 hours for my first playthrough, this was a great purchase during the steam summer sales. Story is well written, with a variety of interesting characters (featuring a badass intro movie) and with the inclusion of choices that changes the outcome of the story dramatically. The Witcher does a good job of explaining what happened prior to the events of the game with the exception of some names and such (being a newb to the series it's hard to keep up with names).

It is a sequel to the 2007 video game The Witcher. Like its predecessor, the game is based on The Witcher series of fantasy novels by Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski. The player directs the actions of Geralt of Rivia, an enhanced human called a Witcher who hunts monsters. The fantasy world in which his adventures take place owes much to Polish history and Slavic mythology.\n\nThis game is great. The story is interesting. The music fits the mood. Battle system is good and finishing moves are awesome. And there are sex scenes. This game reminds me of Berserk.\n\nBerserk (Japanese: ベルセルク Hepburn: Beruseruku?) is a manga series written and illustrated by Kentaro Miura. Set in a medieval Europe-inspired fantasy world, the story centers on the characters of Guts, an orphaned mercenary, and Griffith, the leader of a mercenary band called the Band of the Hawk. Themes of isolation, camaraderie, and the question of whether humanity is fundamentally good or evil pervade the story, as it explores both the best and worst of human nature. Both the manga and anime are noted for their heavy violence.\n\nGame tip: When you are on a mission always and I mean ALWAYS choose a women's side even if she is a witch, an elf or a goat girl, because......

The graphics are ok, but nothing to write home about considering it is supposedly an 'enhanced edition'. Story and lore seem to be dense from what I can tell after roughly two hours.\n\nUnfortunately, combat and interaction are breaking this game for me. Combat is extremely clumsy, it basically boils down to button-mashing, where at no point you have real control over your character, but rather mash buttons as fast as humanly possible and see what the game decides to do.\n\nCombat animations are basic, very basic, you'll sometimes stun an enemy wielding a shield, and when you strike him see a cut-scene like animation where your character delivers a killing blow to an enemy that does not have a shield.\n\nI started the game on 'hard' difficulty, and it took me about 10 minutes to discover how to exploit weaknesses in the AI to a point where I basically go through the fights either with no health loss, the other possible outcome being dying a rather cheesy death due to the no-control combat system.\n\nIf I had to describe the combat system with one word, I'm sorry to say that word would be 'garbage', it pretty much ruins an otherwise decent game.\n\nInteraction is similary painful, there is one interaction key (left mouse), which is also one of your main fighting keys, leading to all sorts of unintentional interactions during combat, especially since the 'hot zones' for interactions are placed badly. This also inhibits game flow, you'll sometimes run towards a ledge, and then have to move around trying to find the interaction zone to actually climb it, there is no fluid 'run up to the ledge and climb it' like you'd expect.\n\nGot this very cheap on sale, if I had bought it for full price I'd say it was wasted money.","March 12, 2015","false","3.1"," 17 of 31 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","17","31","0","0"

And I have also seen a lot of this: "CDProjeKt Red is the only AAA game industry that cares about the PC platform"\n\nWell after playing the game this is what I have to say: The Witcher 2 Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition is a console game.\n\n\n\nLikes:\n\n- Great Cinematics and visuals. Clever use of post-process effects. Makes the graphics look great. Character models are very detailed.\n\n- Deep Story\n\n\n\nDislikes:\n\n- Console style gameplay, all of it, the whole game\n\n- Keyboard and mouse controls are irritating. Tried the gamepad, the K+M issues were gone, but the gamepad has its own set of issues, the same issues for which i hate the gamepad in general. Finished the game with the keyboard and mouse except used the gamepad for arm wrestling(lol double meaning there).\n\n- You have to use a thing called as medallion to highlight pickup objects. Because it is very hard to see pickup objects manually. And that medallion thingy has got a cooldown. It's also hard to focus on pickup objects because of the player's 'running' to 'idle' state animation.\n\n- The minimap and the map wasn't exactly helpful. There will be some objective up a hill but you will end up in a cave directly below it. And the lack of fast travel just made it more irritating. It looks like the game wants me to memorize the directions to each place.\n\n- There will be some objectives that are right in front of you but you will have to circle around the entire town to reach that place since the player cannot jump over a fence or jump down to the floor below. This wouldn't have been a problem if it was only needed to be done once but you need to reach that same place again and again multiple times. The lack of fast travel again adds to the frustration.\n\n- The 'charm' option in dialogues always succeeds. No point in choosing other options.\n\n- Music is average at best. Not great use of sound either.\n\n- I hate memorizing stuff that isn't important to me. And the magic powers that the player has are in sign language, just made it more difficult to memorize. If it was English it would have been a bit easier. There were also some sign language puzzles. Who in the world knows sign language? There was a learning curve for me in this game. I don't usually expect a learning curve in a single-player game(after playing lots of games).\n\n- Some side missions get FAILED if you leave the area or progress the main story. I thought it was an open world RPG. Can't even finish objectives at my leisure. The game is linear for the most part.\n\n- The game wasn't technically impressive for me. There were a lot of loading zones/streaming levels(DOORS). Everything in the distance is either mist/fogged/depth of field blurred out. Basically everything you see in the far distance is of very low quality. And AFAIK there is no zoom functionality. And the third person camera helps hiding a lot of things. And I prefer realistic looking graphics than fantasy graphics even in a fantasy world.\n\n- Too many cutscenes. I wanted a game not a movie.\n\n- Show off.\n\n- Story can be overwhelming. Too many characters to keep track of, and characters are referred to in dialogues very directly some of which you haven't even seen or heard about yet. Poor presentation of story to the player. Ideally this should not be a reason for playing the game again.\n\n- Porny stuff doesn't add value to the game. This must have been a 'like' point for most people. People need to understand that this does not add value to the game. It might be needed for storytelling, but Witcher 2's scenes were deliberately inserted to increase player appreciation. If you are interested in such things go watch porn that is available for free on the internet. But don't praise a game because it has porny stuff in it.\n\n- On the other hand, the gameplay is completely childish and a kid cannot play this game because it has mature content.\n\n- The skill tree isn't very interesting. And you have to meditate to drink potions. Oh! Come on\n\n\n\nDoubtful:\n\n- I must be the only person who found the concept of a 'silver' sword ridiculous.\n\n\n\nSome useful Statistics:\n\nIt's been more than 2 years since the release of Witcher 2. So some valid statistics are available. According to Steam achievements atleast 57.1% of players have started playing the game. And 13.8% of players have finished the game. That means only 24.17% players who have started playing the game have actually completed it. Ideally for a good single player game this percentage should be above 33. This probably means that most of the players either quit playing the game or got stuck somewhere indefinitely or they had better games to play or bought it just to watch the porny stuff in it and not to play the game. I hope this gives you enough reason for why this game is not recommended.\n\n\n\nVerdict : 78/100\n\nThe Witcher 2 Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition is a console game.","March 4, 2014","false","26.8"," 27 of 51 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","27","51","0","0"

The Witcher 2 : Assassins of Kings (Enhanced Edition) is probably the best 3rd person game for pc out there. I feel bad for buying it at a sale but yeah. This game is very special. The story, Great. Gameplay, Great. Gtraphics, Fantastic! So yeah this game is highly recommended to everyone. Even FPS Fans although thats not a feature in this game. The graphics go so smooth and gameplay makes you never want to stop playing. This game truly is an improvement over the first installment excluding the system where you have to wait for the other opponent and can't attack repeaditly although that was also really fun i suppose.\n\nYou play as Geralt of Rivia, a Witcher, also known as a monster slayer is helping in wars and such. I'd rather not spoil for anyone the story because its just so great. This games got the strategy, fantasy, a well written story and is dark at some points in the storyline. You have all sorts of powers from healing to shooting flames and such. So this game get a badass 10/10. Yup.

The combat is also a joy once you get the hang of it's initially unintuitive style. Witcher 2 is more narrative heavy than most action RPGs, but that's what brought me back for a second full play. Two years later the graphics are still striking to behold at times. This game is definitely not for everyone, especially if you get bored with long story sequences. Passive or casual gamers will quickly get lost in the narrative.

From the very detailed options in enhancing the game performance at the start menu. From the numerous new quest givings at the "notice borads in each new area" plus new items they've placed all over the game.

Nevertheless, still a sold expreiances.. :)\n\nReminds a lot of Game of thrones in a differnet perspective. Well..... it's more like the other way around really :P since I've played this before watching the"GOT". Where the monarchs are at war with each other planing, ploting, plouing. XD for the most part this game gets me more hypted and excited for "The wild hunt" even more.\n\nMore importantly, If you ever want to play a good non linear game. With all kinds of dark fantasy like world. Where consiquences can make the diference between life and death. As well as where monsters, vampires, ghost, gouls and goblins wreak havoc all over the place. Well all i can say is this is your game.

The story, thus far, has been pretty well thought out and the characters in the universe fit their role, from the main villians that motivate you to quest to get to them and defeat them, to the dock worker who tells you to screw yourself when you walk by.\n\nThe only main gripes I have about the game are that, one, the inventory systems is clunky. You have some categories that help but you don't for junk and formulas need to be kept in inventory to use/take weight. The second is that the game isn't optimized.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jesperbj/recommended/20920/","jesperbj","Jysk Sengetøjslayer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jesperbj/","253 products in account","The Witcher 2, is my favorite game of all time. Here is why:\n\nWhen you first get into this game, one of the most incredibly made cinematics bids you welcome to the world and story. I am amazed that a small company like CDPR (used to be) could possibly deliever one of the most beautiful PC titles of all time, even in 2014.\n\nBut these guys did it right. With a huge focus on story and it's characters, this game slowly opens up for a world that has so much more depth and feel to it than many other AAA open world games. This world has the advantage on being based on a great bookseries and a having a company behind it, that has the best intentions for everything that is behind it.\n\nIt can be confusing to begin with, but without a doubt fully playable, without having played the first installment of the series. The mechanics can be a little clunky, and the developers have been forced to limit the world to big explorable areas instead of making it truly open world. But it works out for this game - Simply because everything you CAN do, is so incredibly detailed and perfected in every way. The lore and story is absolutely amazing and along with a great soundtrack and mindblowing visuals, it adds up to be the very best game I've ever played.\n\nI write this review after completing the game several times, on each difficulty and gathering all achievements. It is extremely challenging in beginning, but in this game, preperation and strategy, is highly rewarded.\n\nThis is what makes this game so different and so much better from other games:\n\n- Choices matter. The choices you make can change the story completely. There's actually two completely seperated chapters based only one single choice in the game. It makes everything so much more interesting.\n\n- Everything is means something. There's no generic sides quests, like you know it from Skyrim and WoW. There's a lot of content, but they are all well thought out. You won't be forced to gather resources for hours - It will make sense in the end.\n\n- The story is so rich and incredibly well put together. Unlike many other RPGs, you don't get to costumize your character, but also means that the story becomes much more personal, mature and interesting.\n\n- The world, based on a book franchise, that I have now read, because of my love of the game gives this game a huge advantage. The lore is deep and detailed and CDPR has truly taken care of this in the best way possibly. This game also features some of the best soundtracks I know of.\n\nI am incredibly excited for The Witcher 3. And I believe that, to be the only game to ever beat this. That experience will show a truly open world, with a much bigger budget and therefore, far fewer limits. The simple fact, that the main story is around 50 hours long, says a lot about how important the story is in this franchise.\n\nI would recommend anyone who want to play Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt, to begin here. It'll give you a wonderful time, and prepare you for the third installment. I like the first game as well, but I think it might be a little too outdated by now.\n\nTL;DR: If you want to be a medieval jedi knight, you should play this game. And who doesn't want to be a medieval jedi knight? Seriously?","November 23, 2014","true","100.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's light on RPG elements and doesn't come close to the dynamic storytelling or versatile gameplay of Dragon Age (it's not even any better than Jade Empire) or Neverwinter Nights 2, but is still a good game for the grey, dark-fantasy world and complex story.  It essentially includes two versions of the campaign, each should take about 30 hours to complete.\n\nCombat is actually decent unlike the first game, though for a PC game it has some surprising similarities to console games; invisible walls everywhere, lots of important functions bound to one key, and lackluster anti-aliasing.\n\nRegardless, The Witcher 2 is a great game for those who are new to RPGs, and is a good first step before moving onto more serious RPGs.  Mechanics are simplified and there's hardly any actual role-playing, and its scale is very small (though the linearity will bother many true RPG fans), so it shouldn't overwhelm anyone.","June 16, 2013","true","25.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Good graphics, a great mature story and setting, gameplay is astronomically better than Witcher 1. That being said the combat while a million times better than the game before is still lacking, but its cons are outweighed by the pros of having to use intelligent decision-making to prepare for fights which is something that is completely missing from almost all modern RPG lately.\n\nRemember when you had to drink that potion of fire resistance so you could fight that dragon in Skyrim? Or you had to keep a stash of holy water so you could fight vampires? Me neither.\n\nIn Witcher if you do not prepare to fight monsters like a Witcher you will fail miserably, and rightly so for thats what sets apart Witchers from just really juiced up monster slayers.\n\n\nThe game does suffer from trying to be too cinematic, but fortunately this is only for the Prologue. Its recommended that you play Witcher 1 before playing this but you really don't need to as Witcher 1 can be a bit of a chore to play.\n\n\nI would argue that the most important aspect of this game is the mature story, if you are not very into story driven gameplay then I cannot recommend this to you.","March 8, 2014","true","63.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Good graphics, a great mature story and setting, gameplay is astronomically better than Witcher 1. That being said the combat while a million times better than the game before is still lacking, but its cons are outweighed by the pros of having to use intelligent decision-making to prepare for fights which is something that is completely missing from almost all modern RPG lately.\n\nRemember when you had to drink that potion of fire resistance so you could fight that dragon in Skyrim? Or you had to keep a stash of holy water so you could fight vampires? Me neither.\n\nIn Witcher if you do not prepare to fight monsters like a Witcher you will fail miserably, and rightly so for thats what sets apart Witchers from just really juiced up monster slayers.\n\n\nThe game does suffer from trying to be too cinematic, but fortunately this is only for the Prologue. Its recommended that you play Witcher 1 before playing this but you really don't need to as Witcher 1 can be a bit of a chore to play.\n\n\nI would argue that the most important aspect of this game is the mature story, if you are not very into story driven gameplay then I cannot recommend this to you.","March 8, 2014","true","63.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gndjester/recommended/20920/","gndjester","Helios","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gndjester/","184 products in account","Although highly overrated, The Witcher 2 is an interesting adventure primarily due to its story.  It's light on RPG elements and doesn't come close to the dynamic storytelling or versatile gameplay of Dragon Age (it's not even any better than Jade Empire) or Neverwinter Nights 2, but is still a good game for the grey, dark-fantasy world and complex story.  It essentially includes two versions of the campaign, each should take about 30 hours to complete.\n\nCombat is actually decent unlike the first game, though for a PC game it has some surprising similarities to console games; invisible walls everywhere, lots of important functions bound to one key, and lackluster anti-aliasing.\n\nRegardless, The Witcher 2 is a great game for those who are new to RPGs, and is a good first step before moving onto more serious RPGs.  Mechanics are simplified and there's hardly any actual role-playing, and its scale is very small (though the linearity will bother many true RPG fans), so it shouldn't overwhelm anyone.","June 16, 2013","true","25.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Therefore he became a monster slayer, a mercenary known as a witcher that wanders the world seeeking work. His friend, and also a bard, Dandelion recounts his adventures as ballads and poems of the most famous witcher against monster and other evils thrown against him by fate. Geralt is not a good man, as Dandelion says himself, but he tries to maintain his humanity. He does not believe in destiny but he acts as a balance while using his steel swords against human adversaries and the silver sword to slice through monsters alike. In The Witcher 2, Geralt is mistakenly confused as a Kingslayer and as so must search for the real Kingslayer to bring him to his justice. You will face many creatures and monsters, elves and dwarves, and you will have to choose who are your allies and who will feel the wrath of your blade. Geralt is always searching for his lost past and to help him, he can count on his friends the sorcerer Triss Merigold, the bard Dandelion, the dice poker addicted Zoltan, and others that might or might not help him in his endevour. A truely epic tale, that deserves all the praise it got and more to come when Geralt, once again, start wandering the lands of the Northern Kingdoms and the Nilfgaardian Empire in search for more work and blood against all kinds of monsters.

What can i say im not done with the game but god. The story is so good and just i hate haveing to leave it for just going pee or poo. now thats just one thing im not dont with i love this game so much and i need the ending soon. Now for the gameplay. On easy fun and still not boreing like most games some thigns are still hard you still need to learn how to fight diffrent badies mostly monsters. and you hunt them you a witcher its what you do. There is really no bad thing about the fighting gameplay i think i do keep it on the lower levels just for the story and fun. So if you kinda stupit (like me) the game tells you how to kill monsters after you kill alot of them also some cool lore about them. Like with the Harpers (spelling is BAD) the first time you unlock the lore for them you find out they steal dreams while you sleep, also you dont get them back and they feed more off nightmares so thats good for some people. Now for the story stright up without spoilers. ITS FREAKING ASWOME! Now this is just the best story in a game ive seen in a long time just so good i never wanna stop playing jsut to see what happens next and theres HUGE choices to make and they can change everything. Also first time you see you girlfriend shes nude so BEWBS :).  Now for the bad things....  theres gliches for sure its almsot like skyrim kinda with them. Theres less but there wierd and some of them almost break the game for me and theres one bit in chapter 2 where the game dosent really tell you what to do so i kind adident die but got really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ that it kept restarting me at teh same stupit place. but all in all its good. i give it a 9/10.","October 16, 2014","true","22.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The Witcher 2 : Assassins of Kings (Enhanced Edition) is probably the best 3rd person game for pc out there. I feel bad for buying it at a sale but yeah. This game is very special. The story, Great. Gameplay, Great. Gtraphics, Fantastic! So yeah this game is highly recommended to everyone. Even FPS Fans although thats not a feature in this game. The graphics go so smooth and gameplay makes you never want to stop playing. This game truly is an improvement over the first installment excluding the system where you have to wait for the other opponent and can't attack repeaditly although that was also really fun i suppose.\n\nYou play as Geralt of Rivia, a Witcher, also known as a monster slayer is helping in wars and such. I'd rather not spoil for anyone the story because its just so great. This games got the strategy, fantasy, a well written story and is dark at some points in the storyline.

Featuring a brand new engine, intense combat and a returning cast of characters.\n\nAs much as I like this game there are fairly pronounced flaws if you were a player like me, who went through the original game. Everyone except Geralt got a new voice actor, and as a result everyone feels really different for some reason. Alongside that, importing your saved game from the original is very pointless. Your magical swords and unbendable armor that previously saw you through massacring armies of enemies, now has you selling it for the first new bit of equipment. Not only that but a lot of your choices simply do not carry over.\n\nIn the original game for instance Geralt could choose to romance another girl instead of Triss named Shany. Who replaced Triss from then on in the story and was just as important. You could also choose to side with the Squirrels, who start out in this game wanting to murder you despite whatever import you might have had.\n\nAside from this the game is perfectly flawless, your choices are very pronounced and your consequences very real. I just wish the game had a bit more perspective on where it came from and where it was going.","January 27, 2013","true","46.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lyridsreign/recommended/20920/","lyridsreign","EgN| Gunny","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lyridsreign/","228 products in account","The Witcher 2 is a beautifully crafted RPG that takes place in a fantasy world that could reprsent a more sinister version of common high fantasy tropes like LOTR. Unlike most games like Dragon Age 2 and Skryim, The Witcher 2 is a labor of love that respects the player as someone who can think for themselves and not rely on the game to hold their hand. The tutorial for the game is subpar at best, with the game throwing you right into the thick of it without proper preparation. Though the game is incredibly easy for someone to pick up and learn the control scheme, the real challenge comes in the first act once you arrive in Flotsam (very minor spoiler). Playing on the Normal difficulty setting is great for someone who wants to get in right away and learn as they play without dying a lot. There is a heavy emphasis on swordplay, but in order to truely dominate your opponets and emerge ready for the next fight you need to go the extra mile. Alchemy poitions are a double edged sword as you can't drink 500 of them then go into battle as a badass killing machine. Poitions in the game have severe side effects and drinking too many could kill you before the battle has even begun. One such is a poition that gives you night vision and see through walls. However, in the light you will be blinded and forced to fight in the shadows. Drinking this along with two other poitions that affect your damage can have your player fall over dead from the overload of toxins. Magic may not seem much with a few minor spells, however they allow you to keep smaller less threating enemies out of the way while you take care of the bigger target. All in all The Witcher 2 is an amazing RPG that can't be passed up if you're looking for a little more oompf in your game. With the arrival of SteamOS support there is hardly an excuse not to play it now :D","May 22, 2014","true","48.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Good variety of fun, interesting and well designed side quests, with well written stories.\n\nOverall, this game is a piece of art. This is one of those games you should play before you die.

One of, if not the best RPG i have played. Its not as free as Skyrim or such but its beautifully made, the characters are strong characters you care about and the game is deep. At first it can be off putting, but stick at it and you will be rewarded, make potions, traps and use them.\n\nThe combat is frustrating at first, much like the first, and you will only start to get the hang of it half way through, but its great. As you progress you realise Geralt is agility based, and excells when you keep him moving and taking on the enemies without getting in the middle of them and slugging it out. Once you realise he is not a strong slugger but an agile fencer, combat all becomes a dream.\n\nThe story is complex, the decisions are also so, and though there isnt a right and wrong choice, each one has a strong repercussion. You shape the game as you play. Great fun, and at some points i was stuck for minutes trying to decide who to help or which path to take.\n\nBy the end of it you will be itching for part three, and if not, you are dont have a pulse or are a drowner...\n\n4 Thumbs up.\n\n","April 27, 2014","true","48.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/illEverlee/recommended/20920/","illEverlee","illEverlee","http://steamcommunity.com/id/illEverlee/","65 products in account","The Witcher 2 is a vast improvement over its predecessor, and, as the franchise is known for, has many new and variable tropes for a Fantasy RPG game. To highlight some of the game's best features, The Witcher 2's combat is reminiscent of Batman: Arkham Asylum, but requires far greater skill and preparation. I'm not new to Action-RPG's by any means, but I found the first half of the game very challenging and new to grasp, which is a good thing. The combat is by far the most enjoyable, compelling, intense, and straight forward experience I've had in a while, and for the first time, the magic, enchanting, and alchemy systems aren't overly convaluted.\n\nThe story of The Witcher 2 is dark and riviting, and is filled with lots of mystery, political strife, and several player-driven decisions during major events. The only complaint is that the game takes too fondly to the objectification of most, if not all, of it's female characters. I won't get into detail, but if you're ok with that, then I highly recommend playing The Witcher 2 for a new Action-Adventure-RPG experience.","June 5, 2015","true","26.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The Witcher series is becoming one of my favorites within my list of fictional sagas, and this game certainly delivers on all fronts.\n\nAssassins of Kings pulls no punches. It starts off with an incredibly beautiful CGI introduction that rivals even the best studios. Once you start the game, you're thrown right into war, and the rollercoaster ride hasn't even reached the first hill at this point. Geralt's adventures are plentiful - every quest, whether tied into the main questline or just a trivial matter, fits within the world and doesn't feel disjointed or forced.\n\nThe graphics are certainly a huge step up from the original, and still hold up well as of this review (May 2015). I have a AMD 7970 3gb card, and still can't even run this game on 'true' max settings - mind you, the only thing holding me back is the 'Ubersampling' option, which looks unreal, but cuts framerate to a halt on most systems. It's reserved for the 'best of the best' and not many can run it, even today. Aside from that setting, the Witcher II is still beautiful in every respect. The coastline city of Flotsam feels salty and dirty. The nearby marshes displays a sticky, dense fog that utters caution within the unknown. Details such as these are scattered throughout, and you'll never find yourself tired of the eye candy.\n\nFor those who played the original, the combat is a huge breath of fresh air in comparison. Gone is the timed left clicking jumbled mess, replaced by real time combat. You can light attack, heavy attack, or block/riposte. That's it. Despite this well-needed change, however, the fighting can get rather intense, especially on harder difficulties (I played on Dark). Dodge (basically roll) is your best friend. You will find yourself rolling out of harm's way so often, it's not even funny. Roll or die, that's about what it comes down to. 95% roll, 5% swordfighting. Apparently Sonic the Hedgehog is Geralt's spirit animal.\n\nAll the original Signs are back - Aard, Yrden, Quen, Igni, and Axii. In this game, Quen is your best friend. It will save your life countless times - my advice is to invest in upgrading it early. That said, there is a simple yet effective skill tree for Geralt's Signs and other abilities, split into four parts - Training, Swordsmanship, Signs, and Alchemy. Allocate points to the playstyle you like - you'll typically never level them all, so choose wisely.\n\nBriefly touching on loot here - swords and armor are much more plentiful than the first game, which is nice. However those who import Witcher 1 saves will find that their imported content won't last long until a trade in, which is disappointing, especially with one particular weapon you acquire from the first game that its storyline seemed to hold in high regard.\n\nThe story is certainly good, and not too over the top (well, aside from a detail or two). Geralt's choices have much weight in this game, and you'll find more impactful choices than in the first iteration. Also included are various ways to get information in the dialogue options - persuasion (Axii), intimidation, and so forth. I'm not sure if its based on your current skills or a random number roll, but its a fun take on the 'click to ask X question' bit.\n\nMy only real gripe with this game, other than the occasional dodgy combat roll, is the Steam achievements. The game practically forces you to play twice to get absolutely every achievement. 100%'ers, beware. The insane mode alone is risky - one death and your save games become null and void.\n\nOverall, this is an tremendously enjoyable sequel. Not as long as the first, but it has depth and production quality. Definitely worth a playthrough or two! (Note: This game has 'something after the credits'. Stick with it!)","May 30, 2015","true","42.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Way past, that is... This game also respects the players intelligence and maturity, and won't try to hand you everything sugar coated.\n\nAnd then there's the story, and the different branches of it. It definitely surprised me how much of a difference your choice might make in the game! It won't make it obvious either, so if you don't play the game again, or check the differences on a video, you have no idea what the changes are, how big they are, and how much they affect your playthrough.\n\nCertainly recommended for anyone interested in fantasy, rpg, good story, or just a good gaming experience.","May 8, 2015","true","28.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Therefore he became a monster slayer, a mercenary known as a witcher that wanders the world seeeking work. His friend, and also a bard, Dandelion recounts his adventures as ballads and poems of the most famous witcher against monster and other evils thrown against him by fate. Geralt is not a good man, as Dandelion says himself, but he tries to maintain his humanity. He does not believe in destiny but he acts as a balance while using his steel swords against human adversaries and the silver sword to slice through monsters alike. In The Witcher 2, Geralt is mistakenly confused as a Kingslayer and as so must search for the real Kingslayer to bring him to his justice. You will face many creatures and monsters, elves and dwarves, and you will have to choose who are your allies and who will feel the wrath of your blade. Geralt is always searching for his lost past and to help him, he can count on his friends the sorcerer Triss Merigold, the bard Dandelion, the dice poker addicted Zoltan, and others that might or might not help him in his endevour. A truely epic tale, that deserves all the praise it got and more to come when Geralt, once again, start wandering the lands of the Northern Kingdoms and the Nilfgaardian Empire in search for more work and blood against all kinds of monsters. After all, that's what the most famous Witcher is after, isn't it ? Maybe not.","February 4, 2014","true","69.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

One of, if not the best RPG i have played. Its not as free as Skyrim or such but its beautifully made, the characters are strong characters you care about and the game is deep. At first it can be off putting, but stick at it and you will be rewarded, make potions, traps and use them.\n\nThe combat is frustrating at first, much like the first, and you will only start to get the hang of it half way through, but its great. As you progress you realise Geralt is agility based, and excells when you keep him moving and taking on the enemies without getting in the middle of them and slugging it out. Once you realise he is not a strong slugger but an agile fencer, combat all becomes a dream.\n\nThe story is complex, the decisions are also so, and though there isnt a right and wrong choice, each one has a strong repercussion. You shape the game as you play. Great fun, and at some points i was stuck for minutes trying to decide who to help or which path to take.\n\nBy the end of it you will be itching for part three, and if not, you are dont have a pulse or are a drowner...\n\n4 Thumbs up.\n\n","April 27, 2014","true","48.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Among its great strengths in story, quests, art and music it definitely had glaring issues: most notably, some annoying (to the point of being silly) combat moves and the fact that a good two thirds of it is spent in some sort of swamps, sewers and similar-looking dungeons.\n\nThere was no hint of something huge coming ahead.\n\nEnter the Mighty Sequel\nBut suddenly and unexpectedly, The Witcher 2: Assassin of Kings is upon us. And here I am, trying to review it with my jaw dropped and dangling somewhere around my knees.\n\nYou are Geralt, a witcher — a professional monster slayer caught in a midst of political conflict, intrigue and soon after that, on a long quest to clear your good name and discover more pieces in attempt to solve a puzzle of Wild Hunt and your dark past.\n\nNow this is something like ubelievable upgrade over previous installement, unmatched by anything in recent history. Everything you can possibly think of have been drastically improved, expanded and taken to breathtaking levels of visuals, music and sound. All environments are unique and are extremely rich in details: there’s no copy-paste ever.\n\nThe characters, even NPCs, are alive, deep and interesting. There’s no other RPG where you would stop just to listen to NPC talk and smile at some story they tell each other. Every place, every spot, be it in town or outside, has an event connected to it and some amazing quest you can take on: escape from prison (be a master of stealth, or you can make it a little rough), participate in an assault on rebellious town alongisde king and teach his stupid son some good lesson, prevent military abuse of innocent civillians by beating an officer in a one-on-one swordfight, and get away with it because your king favors you so much; visit abandoned and haunted asylum to calm down the spirits of its victims and learn about its grim past, uncover treason and crime, take a taste of dirty medieval town life by participating in brawls, dice poker and arm wrestling games — and earn some additional coin with that!\n\nBut There’s Much More!\nMeet mages, trolls (friendly and not so much), fight a giant Cthulhu with a sorceress by your side, join elves in their guerilla struggle against humans, assist dwarves and visit their mysterious town hidden somewhere deep in the mountains or, if you rather prefer that, stay in a dirty human military camp and become a new star of its colloseum-like fighting arena. The choice is always yours: so be prepared to take it and face the consequences (or enjoy them :-).\n\nCombat\nAnd did I even mention how great fights can be? Devise your tactics, approach and hunt monsters: all different, inhabiting their own areas and requiring unique means to successfully kill; pursue finest gear upgrades to assist yourself in your dirty job. Harvest for ingredients during your trips outside to brew and drink awesome poisions (of a witcher sort) and acquire inhuman powers for a short amount time. Buy materials, schematics and construct deadly traps, bombs and daggers to leave your enemies no chance. Approach several knights that dared to threaten you and perform a powerful finisher move, killing them all at once. Redirect arrows back at your enemies, use powerful witcher magic tricks to trap or stun your foes: block, riposte, perform a quick roll away, then jump and cut your unfortunate foe through while he recovers from a good blast of your yrden (not a typo). You have to fight dirty: you have to fight like a witcher.\n\nAnd all that above is just barely one third of what is in store for you.\n\nConclusion\nI have no idea how CDPR were able to pull that all off.\n\n(Disregard my hours, I own it from elsewhere.)\n\n* * *\n\n[A blast of fire from dragon’s breath]\n\n— Witcher, how do you fight something like THIS?!\n— You don’t, you run.\n— Some professional you are!\n\nOutstanding.","March 18, 2015","true","4.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","2","2","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tyber_Zann/recommended/20920/","Tyber_Zann","Tyber83","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tyber_Zann/","853 products in account","Geralt of Rivia has returned, and with warm welcome. The Witcher series is becoming one of my favorites within my list of fictional sagas, and this game certainly delivers on all fronts.\n\nAssassins of Kings pulls no punches. It starts off with an incredibly beautiful CGI introduction that rivals even the best studios. Once you start the game, you're thrown right into war, and the rollercoaster ride hasn't even reached the first hill at this point. Geralt's adventures are plentiful - every quest, whether tied into the main questline or just a trivial matter, fits within the world and doesn't feel disjointed or forced.\n\nThe graphics are certainly a huge step up from the original, and still hold up well as of this review (May 2015). I have a AMD 7970 3gb card, and still can't even run this game on 'true' max settings - mind you, the only thing holding me back is the 'Ubersampling' option, which looks unreal, but cuts framerate to a halt on most systems. It's reserved for the 'best of the best' and not many can run it, even today. Aside from that setting, the Witcher II is still beautiful in every respect. The coastline city of Flotsam feels salty and dirty. The nearby marshes displays a sticky, dense fog that utters caution within the unknown. Details such as these are scattered throughout, and you'll never find yourself tired of the eye candy.\n\nFor those who played the original, the combat is a huge breath of fresh air in comparison. Gone is the timed left clicking jumbled mess, replaced by real time combat. You can light attack, heavy attack, or block/riposte. That's it. Despite this well-needed change, however, the fighting can get rather intense, especially on harder difficulties (I played on Dark). Dodge (basically roll) is your best friend. You will find yourself rolling out of harm's way so often, it's not even funny. Roll or die, that's about what it comes down to. 95% roll, 5% swordfighting. Apparently Sonic the Hedgehog is Geralt's spirit animal.\n\nAll the original Signs are back - Aard, Yrden, Quen, Igni, and Axii. In this game, Quen is your best friend. It will save your life countless times - my advice is to invest in upgrading it early. That said, there is a simple yet effective skill tree for Geralt's Signs and other abilities, split into four parts - Training, Swordsmanship, Signs, and Alchemy. Allocate points to the playstyle you like - you'll typically never level them all, so choose wisely.\n\nBriefly touching on loot here - swords and armor are much more plentiful than the first game, which is nice. However those who import Witcher 1 saves will find that their imported content won't last long until a trade in, which is disappointing, especially with one particular weapon you acquire from the first game that its storyline seemed to hold in high regard.\n\nThe story is certainly good, and not too over the top (well, aside from a detail or two). Geralt's choices have much weight in this game, and you'll find more impactful choices than in the first iteration. Also included are various ways to get information in the dialogue options - persuasion (Axii), intimidation, and so forth. I'm not sure if its based on your current skills or a random number roll, but its a fun take on the 'click to ask X question' bit.\n\nMy only real gripe with this game, other than the occasional dodgy combat roll, is the Steam achievements. The game practically forces you to play twice to get absolutely every achievement. 100%'ers, beware. The insane mode alone is risky - one death and your save games become null and void.\n\nOverall, this is an tremendously enjoyable sequel. Not as long as the first, but it has depth and production quality. Definitely worth a playthrough or two! (Note: This game has 'something after the credits'. Stick with it!)","May 30, 2015","true","42.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Although it stands proudly as a fine game by itself, I couldn't help comparing it to the (in my opinion) masterpiece that is the first. The combat gets repetitive, the animations ugly and stiff, the AI dumb as ♥♥♥♥, and the ending was quite honestly a little disappointing. However, I do give this game huge marks for the deepness of its moral choices, and, from what I can tell, the different playthroughs are drastically different. As opposed to the previous game, it is not as easy to differentiate between the morally right and wrong answers, and it's certainly a lot harder to figure out what Geralt "would" do, I guess if that makes sense. There's no "this is the Witcher way" path for most choices in this game, unlike in the previous one. However, with my playthrough at least, although I did make mistakes (savescumming is for ♥♥♥♥♥baby queers), I ended the game highly satisfied with my choices. All in all, don't let the slow start fool you, this is a game with a gripping story, captivating character development, and the same lovable Geralt, if not for some minor annoyances. Just be sure to keep you head down, and DON'T FORGET THE YRDEN, THIS SIGN WILL SAVE YOUR GOD DAMNED LIFE AND I REALIZED THIS FAR TOO LATE. This game gets a solid (point range) between 8.5 and 9/10 for me. Sure the ♥♥♥♥♥ there, but so is everything great that makes up for it, looking forward to the next one.","June 3, 2015","true","41.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

I guess that's just because I like my RPGs to be action RPGs and my VN be no action (in the sense of text and choiced only, nothing else). Yet I will recommend it for I suppose it's not that the game is bad, it's that I wanted not the things this game has to offer me and it's kind of my fault for not having thought this through.\n\nThe fights are either too short (too few enemies) or either too hard (too strong enemies) the only fun being those fought when approaching the Harpies nests and on the Vergen's walls. Oh! And no experience for you, level up via the quests only, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ (well, you technically can gain 2-3 levels by fighting during the game, but you have to fight loads of monsters, more than the game actually gives you. And you will not get the exp for them after some time, so no grinding for ya). The loot is poor and you are poor as the Price/Sell ratio is like x5, more for better items (buy for 2500, sell for 100, yeah, right. Or the crafting! Buy a recipe for 100 gold, buy ingridients for 150 gold + pay 20 gold to craft a subart... which you can buy for like 25 gold. Why, again?). Do I have to mention the horribly sluggish system of potions, alchemy, crafting, trading and menus in general? I had to ggole how to switch off the mouse smoothening (there is not a single PC player happy with mouse acceleration/deceleration)\n\nThe "VN" element is... well it's not bad in and of itself, yet the differences in the endings are minute and the dialogue is diluted by the need to fight - or just run around - in between. So I won't be playing it through again, not in the nearest half a year, at least, I see no reason to. Fun is heavily diluted. For me at least.\n\nWhat an irony, but for the aforementioned combination the game might have been actually fun for me. Like if the action RPG elements were to be enhanced and stripped off of all the dialogue nonsense OR if the VN elements (well it's kind of R part of the RPG, so you should give them credit for that) were to be enhanced with meaningful differencies in endings and without the need to have to fight 2-3 enemies in between (come on, 500 enemies slain only after playing for good 30 hours?)\n\nBut I assume all the modern "story rich" RPGs are in some way like that (ME, DE, whatever else). Or am I mistaken and the fighting system and other "action" elements of an RPG in those are fine?\nAll in all I suppose personally I should have picked the Skyrim instead. Or Diablo 3, still haven't played but for its Demo.","January 5, 2015","true","36.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/20920/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Before we proceed, understand that I actually like the gameplay in The Witcher 2. In fact, it's exceptional. Combat is easy to play yet hard to master – an elusive quality in action RPG combat mechanics – with plenty of difficulty and interesting combat scenarios. By the end of the incredibly well put-together tutorial, you'll feel like you honestly participated in medieval siege. A rich and complex crafting system underpins plenty of gameplay interactions and makes many of the incidental bits of junk you collect through the game have real value. And on top of all of this, The Witcher 2 is one of those rare RPGs that flirts with having real consequence to player decisions throughout the dialogue.\n\nThus, I feel I have to give The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings a good review score; by every objective standard of game design, development, and production values, it is an excellent game. I cannot recommend it unreservedly, however, as a few things about the game never quite clicked into place for me. I found myself, at the end of it, more stricken by some of the evident gaps in story and gameplay direction than enthusiastic for the inevitable sequel that, presumably, will tie together the numerous loose ends of the storyline.\n\nThe first Witcher was a game that I had a very hard time playing through. On the one hand, I loved the writing and variety of choice available throughout the dialogue and intrigue portions of the game; on the other hand, most of the momentary gameplay was painfully overcomplicated and obtuse. Any game requiring that I explicitly enter combat mode and then explicitly choose a stance before I can start wailing on dudes loses points in my book. The Witcher 2 eschews many of the more glaring flaws of the original game—a more streamlined UI, a closer camera so you can really see what's going on, and a combat system that emphasizes skill are all welcome additions to the series.\n\nThere are some distinct flaws in the gameplay, though nothing major. The first and most obvious one is how side quest objectives are communicated. The Witcher 2 has joined the slew of recent games that basically lead you through the objectives to complete side quests (and, actually, main quests) by hand. While I have some objections to that in general, my complaint in this case is more about some of the little gaffes in how that's presented.\n\nThe next major flaw in the gameplay is that autosaving is used in the game, but not always in intelligent ways. At some boss fights, the game will autosave right before the big introduction cut-scene of the boss. This makes sense if you walk away from the game for a few days after dying to the monster once; but if you're like me, and try again... several times... then needing to blunder through the cut-scene time and again becomes a real nuisance.\n\nThe third major flaw is that there are unique gameplay modes – such as stealth – which will activate contextually, but you are explicitly told to enter them. Since the game decides when you enter into the mode, why are you telling me to go into the mode? What button is that? Not a big deal by any means, but a little irritation all the same.\n\nGraphically and aurally, the Witcher 2 is a very well put-together game. Lush visuals, fantastic texture work, great visual effects, and clear iconography keep the game attractive.\n\nThe music is, by and large, very fitting, and the sound design tactfully places you in the middle of the events of the game. Lots of nice little touches – folks chopping away at wood in a little village, the crumbling of nearby rocks as you climb down a cliff face, or the occasional snap of twigs as you tromp through the forest – pop out of the speakers regularly. Voice acting is also quite good.\n\nI think I take the most issue with the writing and character design. By and large, the Witcher series has a very dim view of most people. Just about everyone is an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in The Witcher 2; even Geralt's sorceress girlfriend, the character who the writers tried hardest to make sympathetic, comes off as a catty, jealous ♥♥♥♥♥ at times. It's not that I believe people are always nice and friendly, but when there's not a single decent person to talk to, it gets hard to take any of the characters seriously.\n\nThe other side of this is that some of the best written, most charismatic and genuinely fun characters to be around don't last terribly long. This is made abundantly clear by the end of the tutorial. Apparently in Witcher world, fun people aren't fit to live.\n\nBy the end of the game, I found myself left with a distinctly ashen taste in my mouth; the victories are left hollow and incomplete. Partially because the ending doesn't fully resolve the numerous sub-plots of the game, but also because the storyline felt arbitrary and disconnected. The Witcher's style – weirdly dark and artificially edgy, especially for a fantasy title – creates disjointed storylines that, even when the promised ending occurs, are a letdown.\n\nI also might mention that The Witcher 2 represents a... particular view of women. If you are comfortable seeing women portrayed as little more than ♥♥♥♥ and ♥♥♥, then this is the game for you! If, on the other hand, you find the lack of strong female characters in games to be irritating, then this really isn't for you. Triss and Ves, two of the notable female characters of the game, don't count, by the way; both spend most of their screen-time in form-fitting outfits, prancing their overly shapely asses about the focus point of the camera and generally requiring Geralt's manly help to accomplish much of anything.\n\nDespite all the little flaws and caveats, The Witcher 2 is, ultimately, a fantastic game; any fan of darker, more consequentialist fiction will find themselves right at home. Nevertheless, those of you looking for something more upbeat, more uplifting – and frankly, less draining to play – will want to look elsewhere. The Witcher 2 is bittersweet.","December 30, 2013","true","102.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I could only roll and slash with my sword and do some wierd fire thing. Wtf Nintendo?

It's one of the best games ever made).  After experiencing the incredible gift from the heavens that is Witcher 3 I decided to go back and play the first two installments of the franchise.\n\nThe Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings at first glance did not look particularly amazing(at least compared to Witcher 3), but after I got into it a bit, I realized that this game was quite good.\n\nSiding with Roche or Iorveth at the end of Chapter 1 completely changes how the rest of the game plays out.\n\nStory: 8/10  Mechanics: 4/10 Soundtrack: 9/10 Graphics: 9/10\nHere is a quick rundown of some pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n- Captivating and interesting storyline.\n- Beautiful world\n- Your choices matter!  (Even sidequests that appear insignificant can have a significant outcome on the storyline.)\n- Awesome soundtrack\n\nCons:\n- Quite poor interfacing issues (detailed below)\n- A so-so combat system (also detailed below)\n- Annoying navigation mechanics\n\nWhile this game is awesome as a whole, it does have its flaws.  One of its biggest flaws is its combat system.  The combat system is a bit difficult to learn, but once you have learned it, it shouldn't be as much as a burden on you.  The combat system could be accurately described as inefficient, to say the least.  When first starting the game, the game seems ridiculously difficult at times simply because it is impossible to find decent gear early on.  Later on, however, it is much easier to buy/craft better gear, which then makes the difficulty a bit more manageable.  The auto-targetting system can be a real pain at times.  In most games, when you face an opponent and press the attack button/key, your character attacks that opponent.  That is not the case in this game.  Geralt will sometimes attack a random opponent if you are in the midst of a group of enemies.  Also, dodging enemy attacks can become very difficult when fighting groups of enemies, not because it is difficult to avoid them, but because the roll mechanic often times will not roll you in the direction you are wanting to roll to.  Sometimes I would try to dodge roll backwards, and I would instead go forwards, and therefore be killed by a horde of enemies.  All of these flaws mentioned above CAN be avoided with a bit of practice.  It's a shame you have to battle the mechanics, but it is what it is.\n\nThe navigation system can become particulary annoying at times.  There were many points in the game where I asked myself, "Where in the world do I need to go next?"  Sometimes it would take me up to half an hour to find the answer to that question.  The minimap does show you where to go most of the time, but it does so with a single orange triangle, which is very small and sometimes hard to see.  For some quests, you will be required to complete a task with absolutely no assistance from the minimap.  These quests could involve finding a certain character or fetching a certain item.  This issue is somewhat rare so I didn't find it too annoying, but when it did happen, it took me forever to find what I needed to find to progress.\n\nOverall, once I got used to the sketchy mechanics, I really loved this game.\n\n7/10","February 2","true","25.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

And on top of all of this, The Witcher 2 is one of those rare RPGs that flirts with having real consequence to player decisions throughout the dialogue.\n\nThus, I feel I have to give The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings a good review score; by every objective standard of game design, development, and production values, it is an excellent game. I cannot recommend it unreservedly, however, as a few things about the game never quite clicked into place for me. I found myself, at the end of it, more stricken by some of the evident gaps in story and gameplay direction than enthusiastic for the inevitable sequel that, presumably, will tie together the numerous loose ends of the storyline.\n\nThe first Witcher was a game that I had a very hard time playing through. On the one hand, I loved the writing and variety of choice available throughout the dialogue and intrigue portions of the game; on the other hand, most of the momentary gameplay was painfully overcomplicated and obtuse. Any game requiring that I explicitly enter combat mode and then explicitly choose a stance before I can start wailing on dudes loses points in my book. The Witcher 2 eschews many of the more glaring flaws of the original game—a more streamlined UI, a closer camera so you can really see what's going on, and a combat system that emphasizes skill are all welcome additions to the series.\n\nThere are some distinct flaws in the gameplay, though nothing major. The first and most obvious one is how side quest objectives are communicated. The Witcher 2 has joined the slew of recent games that basically lead you through the objectives to complete side quests (and, actually, main quests) by hand. While I have some objections to that in general, my complaint in this case is more about some of the little gaffes in how that's presented.\n\nThe next major flaw in the gameplay is that autosaving is used in the game, but not always in intelligent ways. At some boss fights, the game will autosave right before the big introduction cut-scene of the boss. This makes sense if you walk away from the game for a few days after dying to the monster once; but if you're like me, and try again... several times... then needing to blunder through the cut-scene time and again becomes a real nuisance.\n\nThe third major flaw is that there are unique gameplay modes – such as stealth – which will activate contextually, but you are explicitly told to enter them. Since the game decides when you enter into the mode, why are you telling me to go into the mode? What button is that? Not a big deal by any means, but a little irritation all the same.\n\nGraphically and aurally, the Witcher 2 is a very well put-together game. Lush visuals, fantastic texture work, great visual effects, and clear iconography keep the game attractive.\n\nThe music is, by and large, very fitting, and the sound design tactfully places you in the middle of the events of the game. Lots of nice little touches – folks chopping away at wood in a little village, the crumbling of nearby rocks as you climb down a cliff face, or the occasional snap of twigs as you tromp through the forest – pop out of the speakers regularly. Voice acting is also quite good.\n\nI think I take the most issue with the writing and character design. By and large, the Witcher series has a very dim view of most people. Just about everyone is an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in The Witcher 2; even Geralt's sorceress girlfriend, the character who the writers tried hardest to make sympathetic, comes off as a catty, jealous ♥♥♥♥♥ at times. It's not that I believe people are always nice and friendly, but when there's not a single decent person to talk to, it gets hard to take any of the characters seriously.\n\nThe other side of this is that some of the best written, most charismatic and genuinely fun characters to be around don't last terribly long. This is made abundantly clear by the end of the tutorial. Apparently in Witcher world, fun people aren't fit to live.\n\nBy the end of the game, I found myself left with a distinctly ashen taste in my mouth; the victories are left hollow and incomplete. Partially because the ending doesn't fully resolve the numerous sub-plots of the game, but also because the storyline felt arbitrary and disconnected. The Witcher's style – weirdly dark and artificially edgy, especially for a fantasy title – creates disjointed storylines that, even when the promised ending occurs, are a letdown.\n\nI also might mention that The Witcher 2 represents a... particular view of women. If you are comfortable seeing women portrayed as little more than ♥♥♥♥ and ♥♥♥, then this is the game for you! If, on the other hand, you find the lack of strong female characters in games to be irritating, then this really isn't for you. Triss and Ves, two of the notable female characters of the game, don't count, by the way; both spend most of their screen-time in form-fitting outfits, prancing their overly shapely asses about the focus point of the camera and generally requiring Geralt's manly help to accomplish much of anything.\n\nDespite all the little flaws and caveats, The Witcher 2 is, ultimately, a fantastic game; any fan of darker, more consequentialist fiction will find themselves right at home. Nevertheless, those of you looking for something more upbeat, more uplifting – and frankly, less draining to play – will want to look elsewhere. The Witcher 2 is bittersweet.","December 30, 2013","true","102.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

An outstanding Role Playing Game, no two replays of this game will ever be the same. In the Witcher 2, you are thrust into the character of Geralt of Rivia, famed monster slayer and unintended savior of a king, where you must make the decisions that alter the fates of not only the protagonist but the world and its many characters about him. Its a compelling narrative about maintaining neutrality in a world that is morally ambiguous and deceptive. You will feel the sting of unintended consequences, and with a variety of supporting characters, all whose lives and motivations you will come to understand, decisions in this game are not made lightly . Aside from its storyline, the actual mechanics of the gameplay are superbly executed. Combat is visceral and tactical. Magic, Alchemy, and swordplay are your means of defeating your enemies, and the Witcher 2 introduces a menagerie containing all sorts of monsters, both fantastically gargantuan & sometimes human, whose strengths/weaknesses must be taken into account, especially on the hardest of difficulties. In the end, the Witcher 2 is a satisfying video game with a storyline that leaves it's impression upon you because of it's relation to your impact as Geralt.

I was in prison but then I was running from a dragon, only seconds later to be boning a sorceress and thrust into the center of a war-torn battlefield only then to be suddenly teleported back into a prison cell being beaten by two men.\n\nI can only conclude that the main character has inter-dimensional teleportation abilities but felt this aspect wasn't represented well in gameplay.

If you have played the first game or read the books this game is for you!\n\nThis game looks really good for when it was made It has tons of settings though need more Antialiasing badly! This game ran well and I never had any bugs or crashes of any sort. The Ai is well done and not buggy.\n\nYou don't need any background knowledge to play this game and pretty much anyone can play even if it is a bit difficult at times. All side quests are interesting and some have different paths to choose from such as saving a troll or just outright killing and not looking deeper to see why it's attacking people. This is where the game is amazing you can play this game many different ways and has lots of replay ability value and you could play it 2-3 times just to see everything. Everyone's voice acting and the voice acting is pretty well done. I would suggest playing this game before Witcher 3.\n\nFinal verdict: 8/10 Look for it on sale if you are a RPG fan or read the books.","June 1, 2015","true","29.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Keep selling it for linux if they must, but its advertisement as being available for steamos/linux has been on the front page for far too long. This is not what we want linux noobs to try and play and think this is what linux gaming is about.. they have heard enough crap about gaming on linux and this only adds fuel to the negative press linux gets as a gaming platform. Yes it starts up.. and yes you can technically "play" it. Though I cannot suggest anybody play this title in linux. I had picked it up on sale and never really played it until the linux version came out and I finally got excited for it only to be really let down. It is NOT a native linux title by any stretch of the imagination as it uses a "wine type" wrapper to make it run on linux. So just deal with it and play this game on windows if you are going to play it.\n\nI will not "not" recomend this game as it's gorgeous if you have the hardware for it and from what I have played is a great game. I am just adding to the growing list of warnings about this title for linux so the linux noobs don't get the wrong idea.\n\nEDIT* Forgot I wrote this, I should note that they made great strides in getting the performance of the EON wrapper to a much more acceptable level and I can actually recommend it to be played in Linux now. Don't expect it to run as well as in windows but it is certainly acceptable IMO.","July 28, 2014","true","31.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/OdeToJoy_by/recommended/20920/","OdeToJoy_by","Ode To Joy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/OdeToJoy_by/","97 products in account","Just finished The Witcher 2 and I got to admit it's like it tries to be both a RPG and a VN, yet fails (as I see it) to be either. I guess that's just because I like my RPGs to be action RPGs and my VN be no action (in the sense of text and choiced only, nothing else). Yet I will recommend it for I suppose it's not that the game is bad, it's that I wanted not the things this game has to offer me and it's kind of my fault for not having thought this through.\n\nThe fights are either too short (too few enemies) or either too hard (too strong enemies) the only fun being those fought when approaching the Harpies nests and on the Vergen's walls. Oh! And no experience for you, level up via the quests only, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ (well, you technically can gain 2-3 levels by fighting during the game, but you have to fight loads of monsters, more than the game actually gives you. And you will not get the exp for them after some time, so no grinding for ya). The loot is poor and you are poor as the Price/Sell ratio is like x5, more for better items (buy for 2500, sell for 100, yeah, right. Or the crafting! Buy a recipe for 100 gold, buy ingridients for 150 gold + pay 20 gold to craft a subart... which you can buy for like 25 gold. Why, again?). Do I have to mention the horribly sluggish system of potions, alchemy, crafting, trading and menus in general? I had to ggole how to switch off the mouse smoothening (there is not a single PC player happy with mouse acceleration/deceleration)\n\nThe "VN" element is... well it's not bad in and of itself, yet the differences in the endings are minute and the dialogue is diluted by the need to fight - or just run around - in between. So I won't be playing it through again, not in the nearest half a year, at least, I see no reason to. Fun is heavily diluted. For me at least.\n\nWhat an irony, but for the aforementioned combination the game might have been actually fun for me. Like if the action RPG elements were to be enhanced and stripped off of all the dialogue nonsense OR if the VN elements (well it's kind of R part of the RPG, so you should give them credit for that) were to be enhanced with meaningful differencies in endings and without the need to have to fight 2-3 enemies in between (come on, 500 enemies slain only after playing for good 30 hours?)\n\nBut I assume all the modern "story rich" RPGs are in some way like that (ME, DE, whatever else). Or am I mistaken and the fighting system and other "action" elements of an RPG in those are fine?\nAll in all I suppose personally I should have picked the Skyrim instead. Or Diablo 3, still haven't played but for its Demo.","January 5, 2015","true","36.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Loads faster(which is kind of surprising because the first game's load times weren't even long), stutters less, and, of course, looks prettier. And I mean much prettier. You don't expect games that look this much better than their prequels to actually perform better than them.\n\nThe only things about it that I don't like are the differed rendering(alternate form of rendering that only supports [and works] [with] a form of anti-aliasing that has been specifically coded into the game, cancelling out any kind of AA forced on from your graphics control panel. Use SweetFX for AA.), sharpness filter(you'll wanna turn it off in your user config, but make sure to force Anisotrophic Filtering on), and the bloom. The bloom.. I usually am ok with bloom in my games, but I had to turn this game's off. There is just too much of it. For my eyes, anyway.\n\nGraphics settings:\nMany graphics settings available for tweaking. There's a lot you can make changes to that will help the game run better on your rig, if it needs it\n\nControls:\nControls are greatly improved. Dodging actually works consistently, unlike in the last game. Same with parrying. Same with attacking. I remember instances in the first Witcher where the system sometimes wouldn't let me attack opponents if they were close to me or surrounded me or just didn't let me attack them(while not stunned, etc). When attacking, you use either the left or right mouse button. Either are for heavy or light attacks. Is not like the first Witcher where you select an attack style and click on a foe. The buttons are the styles, so they have to be used/pressed after each attack. Can be combined.\n\nThey took out the feature that let's you press/hold a button/key to highlight/display whatever in view can be interacted with, as well as the the feature that's you select what you want to interact with the cursor, while you hold/press a button. It's not that big of a deal not having it, but you now have to just run up to something you see, and click on it to do whatever with it.\n\nGameplay:\nAm a few hours into the game, but can say it's very much like the first. Only, better.\n\nCombat is same, but more engaging. Also kinda harder(but I was playing on Dark/Insane difficulty.). You can meditate anywhere(no fireplaces/characters needed) that wouldn't be considered dangerous(out of battle, not in the presence of enemies). Inside or outside.\n\nSo far, the choice system is still here. I've been in situations in the game where I could, as an example, stop a crime or let it follow through. There are also sub-choices, which can sometimes be made after main choices have been made. Good/bad/etc ones are available.\n\nEDIT:\n\nOverall:\nHave since spent more hours playing the game and am enjoying it. The story is very much still that of The Witcher's, and the gameplay is very fun. Good combat, and there more options for interacting with characters you encounter than there were in last Witcher game.\n\nThe game feels like it was made on PC, which is awesome. Same as the last game. Same level of detail in the enviornments, great graphics, and doesn't feel like some technically-constrained console port.\n\n"coughs" Skyrim "coughs" Fallout","November 19, 2014","true","50.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This game really makes you think it makes each choice seem right and wrong at the same time, its always up to you to pick the lesser evil. So the combat; good although i would have liked to see more kill cutscenes, they are there and awesome, as good as skyrims but i think they had a very low chance of occurring, a miniscule matter,  the visuals, even in 2014 they remain brilliant and outstanding, the story line was elegant with twists and turns, the antagonists more or less stay the same but how antagonistic they actually are change smoothly and frequently. Yes this game was slightly linear, so what it told a story and that story was brilliantly told and acted out  . 9.5 out of ten, best game I have played, the developers obviously care not for money but love what they do, and they are damn good at it, a great franchise full of potential  and a great uprising company to support.

Paid $3 for this game and the content here goes beyond retail price of most mordern games today. The story is a mature one, dealing with social movements within that world in a very well realized era. It is a fantasy game but the world and scenarios are sold very well.\n\nOn another note, there is a lot of tatas and "bing bing" action going on. It's good to see a developer fighting for the pervy audience. It appeals to a large crowd except the gays. No pipis here :'(.\n\nAnyways, gameplay is fun and engaging. Have to say Geralt moves stiff and some of the mayor issues where corrected on The Witcher 3 and then some but what you get here is a grand improvement over the original in every area and a great gaming experience overall.","May 22","true","38.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Can't have enough of it. Despite the incredibly high learning curve that the combat system has, and despite hating the fact that in order to survive, in more than one occasion, it is required to just run a couple of minutes in circle, probably, because the game offers a different combat system in comparison with The Witcher, it is possible that I've forgotten all about preparations for a battle, but in my defense, many times, you just get ambush into fight, with no preparation at all, and (one last despite) despite being the world's slowest Witcher to draw your sword after a cutscene, having a clear handicap against some incredibly mighty foes, this game just knows how to balance it all makes all of those despites disappear, and just focusing on how much you have acquired by the end.\n\nThe story is incredibly rich and powerful. The decisions will not only torn you apart, but will also make you want to play it again, just to see what you have missed or to experience that other decision, which let me tell you, it does not dissapoint.\n\nIt clearly makes you think about what kind of Witcher you would like to be, since the abilities are so many, but the amount you get to acquired are limited.\n\nOverall, a great game that lets you know how great Geralt of Rivia is before heading over to The Witcher 3, which is the next one on my list!","December 21, 2015","true","135.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Big deal for me. I want stars and ♥♥♥♥. There are some...clouds...I guess...sorta?\n-Boring companions. At first I was hype to see Dandilion and the Dwarf, but they end up just hanging around not saying ♥♥♥♥. You interacted a lot more with your homies in TW1 and there was some funny stuff, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Voice Acting aside/included.\n-Crazy bad texture pop-in. Still one of the best looking games around, but the pop-in nearly ruins it.\n-Dice board isn't as pretty. Just a nitpick, and obviously just my opinion.\n\nThe main thing that made The Witcher 1 an incredible game was an actual sense of being a Monster Hunter. TW2 does a good job in many ways, but not in the one that I think was most effective.\n\nMoney. The struggle is real in TW1. You NEED to go hunt down x Monster to make that cash. You need to bar fight and play Dice sometimes. I always really felt like I was truly hunting monsters as a profession, because I -had- to do what I could to make scratch.\n\nThe other element in TW1 is just being a Witcher in general...potions. I had to max the difficulty of course but, drinking potions and using spells was a huge deal in TW1. Before you enter a cave, you make sure you're set with potions. You take a moment to prepare and drink up before going in. It mattered. At first I thought it was lame. He felt weak, and it seemed pathetic that he needed potions to even fight.\n\nBut, I adjusted to the fact that he's a "Witcher" and that's how they roll, because normal people can't even drink the potions without damn near dying. I mean, I'm sure he can whoop anybody's ♥♥♥ without the potions, but these are monsters. It made sense when I really thought about it, and added to the strategy.\n\nCombat too..not everyone agrees but I thought combat in TW1 was sick as ♥♥♥♥. Loved the stances.\n\nGame just had this "vibe" that you can't really put into words as well.\n\nThank you for reading my TL:DR TW1 review.","January 31, 2015","true","61.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

The story is really intriguing, filled with political and racial conflict, while still maintaining a very personal feel and with some great characters to accompany you on this journey.\n\nThe combat is probably the most divisive element of the game, some will enjoy it (like I did), and others won't (at least it's a better combat system than the one in the first Witcher).\n\nTechnically, it still holds up today, and this was released in 2011, although some animations are a bit robotic, but that is something omnipresent on RPG's, so I let it pass.

You probably need at least a GTX660 to run this one in 60 fps.      Gameplay: Good     I rate this as good because while the overall gameplay is Excellent, however, the combat is kinda a let-down. It's difficult and it takes a while to get used to it. Dark Souls may be hard, but the combat isn't that bad. It's fun and altogether very enjoyable. It's a very different case with The Witcher 2, I'm afraid.","December 29, 2014","true","17.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The series seems to be becoming more action/adventure oriented than an RPG meant for purists, but what this game does it does very well. The combat system has become more oriented toward player skill rather than Geralt's attributes, but this turned out to be pretty fun once I got the hang of the controls. Branching storylines encourage replayability, as in the first game. At first I had a problem with the excessive use of bloom and shader effects, though these things are implemented far better and more artistically after the first chapter, so I suggest everyone keep these settings enabled. Overall this is a very well-written and clever game and I would recommend it to fans of the first game or fans of the fantasy fiction genre in general. You won't be disappointed!","September 12, 2014","true","48.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Great RPG elements, great plot, wonderful difficulty, wonderful graphics, etc. All of this praise applies to this game, keep that in mind. Two important things to say, if you already can't tell, this isn't a a game for kids, the M rating, if written down, would take up a standard office paper. Second, this game has poor optimization for particular builds of computers, don't let this scare you away, but if you are on the lower end of the spectrum when it comes to minimum requirements, you should check online to ensure your gaming experience will be satisfactory, I was decently ahead of the minimum requirements with a 2.9GHz dual core (AMD) and a Nvidia Geforce GT 240 with 1GB DDR3 VRAM, with 8GB of 1833 Mhz of "normal" RAM. This said, being reasonably well ahead of the minimum requirements, I had to set every graphics setting to the lowest possible setting, and then set my resolution to 800x600 to play at a playable FPS (30). In defense of CDProjektRed, I did have an "interesting" graphics card at the time, and have since moved to a more "standard" card. Everything under consideration, this is an excellent title.","February 10, 2014","true","57.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Some big decisions to make throughout the game that will change how the story pans out, and I will definately be playing through it again to get the other endings.\n\nThis one will be tough on your graphics card, even some of the newer ones at max settings may struggle a little, but as you can see from the screens it is a gorgeous looking game.\n\nMy only dislike was the whole potions and meditating thing, wasn't a fan of that really, but other than that this game is a must play for any RPG or fantasy fan and I cannot wait for the finale, Witcher 3","February 8, 2014","true","63.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

YOU (not your character) will NEED to learn how to make the best/cheapest potions, swords, armors etc. And you WILL need to use them in order to finish the game.\n\nHard=Rewarding combat -> In the beginning you might find the combat hard, but if you spend some time in the "Arena" (an Arcade like mode that you can play before you start the story , you can practice and learn the combat). Killing a monster makes you feel like a real witcher , because it requires skill and THOGHT.\n\nGreat side missions ->  The side missions are NOT  repetitive. In each area you will have contracts which you don`t have to  take, they are not even mentioned in the story , you will have to find the board where they are posted on. They EXPAND the world of the witcher.  There are huge areas that you might not even see if you don't take on the side missions.\n\nGREAT DEVELOPER -> This team has updated their game with DLC for FREE since 2011.","December 1, 2013","true","26.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

Especially the lighting effects looks astonishing. The story is mature and rather complex, but I couldn't really appreciate it as much as others have done. Maybe it was because I haven't played the first game and therefore missed out on some parts of the overall story and the lore. Either way I thought it was a little bit too confusing at times, especially when the facial expressions and character animations wasn't very good.\n\nI also thought that the menus could've been better - they often felt slow, unresponsive and very irritating.\n\nBut the thing that kept me playing was the superb combat! The feeling when you fought against a large number of enemies at the same time and you had to think tactical to survive was really rewarding!\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the game but was a little disappointed with the story, mostly because I've heard a lot good things about it. I do recommend the game though, especially if you want to test what your computer is capable of.","March 16, 2014","true","30.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Unfortunately as you progress the boss battles become too easy, the isn't really that much in the world to explore & the game seems over too quickly (well it feels quick even though it was +30 hours for me).\n\nHad the boss battles remained tough, crafting provided more reward & the ending not so abrupt W2 would be a solid 9/10 for me.

I strongly recommend reading the books before playing the Witcher games. You can play without it, but the knowledge of the lore, and especially the characters will make your experience much much better. I really enjoyed it although there are few very frustrating moments. The game in general is pretty difficult (I played on the "hard" setting) and challenging, but the overall experience makes it just. And you can always lower the difficulty in case you really want to progress with the story and you can't get past some fight. most importantly - this is a great story driven game which IS NOT a hack'n'slash! you really have to think in the combat parts, or you're getting nowhere.

I've tried several times since the original release and EE release, but I just couldn't bear the missions in the first chapter.\n\nBut recently I just said - f**k it, let's blast through it. I bought a controller, which helped immensely with enjoying the game, it made the most important aspect of that kind of game - combat - smoother and pleasant. I turned Big Picture mode on my TV, and I breezed through it in a few days. I was having a blast. It was amazing.\n\nI've never been a big fan of CRPGs/ARPGs but the story was fulfilling, combat was enjoyable, graphical fidelity and graphical design were astonishing, original voice acting was well done altough it had a few awkward and bad moments, and music was lovely.\n\nIt really is a great game, enjoyable for hardcore RPG fans and also for casual RPG fans.\n\nThe biggest gripe I have with this title is the repetitiveness of NPC's designs. In the first chapter it hadn't been noticeable, but after seeing the same body type and face for the 50th time in the chapter 2 and 3, it became noticeable, annoyingly so.\n\n\n\nI have got to admit - I wasn't really hyped about Witcher 3 before playing W2. But now? Damn, I am so excited to know more about Wild Hunt - this menacing power of some sorts, which was only barely mentioned in Witcher 2.\n[Story spoilers]\nAnd what happened to Roche and Anais? To Yennefer? Who is going to stop Nilfgaard?\n\nBut I'm afraid that Witcher 3 will require a considerable upgrade of my PC.","April 28, 2014","true","41.8"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

Combat is awesome. Good RPG element. A tale to be told.\n\n7/10\n\nPro\n+ Awesome sex scene\n+ Awesome combat\n+ Awesome character\n+ Awesome story for main quest\n+ Awesome crafting mechanic\n+ Awesome graphic\n\nCon\n- Less sex\n- Less secondary quest\n- Less monster hunting\n- Less fun mini game.\n- Graphic can be too bright/contrast\n- Nerf of potion, oil etc.\n\nFull Review Second game in The Witcher series from CDPR.\nYou will continue to play as Geralt, a witcher, after the event of the first game.\n\nYou can tell how much CDPR have put they effort on this game to improve from the first witcher.\n\nThe graphic is so awesome. Thanks for REDengine from CDPR themselves. It look better then most game these day.\nThe world setting and location fit the world of witcher nicely.\nCombat have been improve a lot. More fluid and responsive. Really fun to play.\nCrafting and overall game mechanic is a lot more easier.\nThese are the first few thing you will notice after 15 minutes in the game and you will get addicts to this game right off the bat.\n\nThe main story of The witcher 2 is more intense, more mature and come with really hard choice to choose.\nYour decision can affect the whole game story. Make The witcher 2 have lot of replayability.\nIt deserve to play at least twice.\n\nThe charecters in The witcher 2 is also very interesting. You will learn to love or hate them as the story go.\n\nBUT  I rate this game less then The Witcher 1 (I rate first one 8/10).\nWhile gameplay and graphic have been improve a lot. The story of the witcher 2 not really appeal to me.\n(Is it just me that like the story of TW1 then TW2. I don't really like political element in TW2. I think it's a bit too much and I feel like political don't fit well with the witcher story)\nWhat really dissappoint me is secondary quest. There is less secondary quest to play in the witcher 2 and none of them is memorable. The monster contract in The witcher 2 is more deeper and harder to complete which I like but there is so little of them. Make it lost the feeling of being the witcher. There is also not much monster in the wild and not much variety.\n\nI don't really like the mini game is this one too. Poker dice is hard to read, fist fighting become QTE and arm wrestling is way too easy. There is also no romance card to collect (AKA less sex).\n\nThe graphic is really good but at time it can be too bright and color and be too contrast. It does look beautiful but sometime it's just too much. Also, This maybe a tiny thing but the graphic and control option have to be adjust outside the game.\n\nPotion is one of the most important part in The witcher. In the witcher 2 you can brew potion, crafting and meditating without bonfire BUT you can't drink potion while in combat!! And the duration of potion and other buff have been decrease a lot. I understand that CDPR try to balancing the game since the buff can be to OP (In the witcher 1 potion last many hours depand on what kind while The Witcher 2 last 10 minute). But with duration of potion nerf and need of meditating to drink potion make potion in witcher 2 almost useless. If you prepare and drink your potion first it can go out of effect while in cutscene or conversation and if fight happan immediatly you can't drink potion. I often found that duration is too short and not enought while explore the area. But good thing is you can brew/drink potion anytime and you can upgrade your skill or equipment to make duration longer. I just found it quite annoying to keep drinking potion.\n\nSummary The witcher 2 overall is one of the best RPG experiance to have. Beautiful graphic and world setting. Very good combat and game mechanic is easy to understand. Deep story with hard choice to be made and lot of replayability.\n\nI may complain in a few thing about The witcher 2 but maybe I adhere to The witcher 1 too much.\n\nThe witcher 2 is a must play in my opinion.\n\nPS : Sorry for my english.","August 5, 2015","true","38.5"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","5","8","2","0"

Many choices are made throughout the game, and all of them feel like a moral shade of grey, being much more interesting than the good-or-evil binary in some other games. The game feels like it covers only a small section of a much larger canvas, and it is always obvious that important events are happening around Geralt and company.\n\nThe world feels alive and lived-in, and there are many small details that draw you in. NPCs gather in town centers and taverns and banter between each other. Some of the dialog ends up repeated if you stick around one area too long, but it is written well and does not become grating. Creature design is good, and some of the larger ones are very intimidating. Monsters in the wild form packs and hunt and attack other monsters (and you).\n\nThe combat in this game is good, but not great. Most fights can be either rushed down quickly or kited around, getting in a few hits at a time. Strong attacks seem more effective than fast attacks almost all of the time, and I sorely missed the "group" attacks from the first game. The signs are useful to varying degrees. I found myself using Quen, Aard, and Yrden signs fairly often, but Igni and Axii signs were hardly ever used. Preparing for combat by drinking potions and using sword oils is very important, especially for more challenging fights.\n\nFor some reason, you cannot lock on to bosses, but the camera is still cooperative and not too much of a pain to manage.\n\nThe inventory system is streamlined from the first game, and is less of a chore to manage.","September 28, 2015","true","26.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Not because The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt wouldn't work as a standalone game. Actually it does, and it does it very well.\n\nI got this game on sale for 2,99€ a few days back. My only problem with this game is that I have already finished The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt before starting this game. Truth be told, these games look much alike. So for a 2011 game The Witcher 2 looks great and feels great. If I had never played The Witcher 3 I would probably consider this one of the\ngreatest games I have ever played. The story, dialogue, acting, combat - all of it is there and it's good.\n\nBut here is the problem; none of it is quite as good as with The Witcher 3. If you have never played The Witcher 3 you wouldn't know all the tiny things you're missing when you're playing The Witcher 2. But if you already have, you got to admit that in comparison The Witcher 2 feels rather small, clunky, limiting and occasionally claustrophobically one dimensional. This is not exactly fault of the game itself, but because the sequel happens to be probably the best game ever made.\n\nSo do yourself a favour and don't do like I did. Don't go straight to The Witcher 3, but play this one (and even the first one if you can stomach the outdated experience) first or it will be very hard to come back. Personally I've found the story itself intriguing and craving more for the world of The Witcher. Right now, being used to the best coming back to something almost as good isn't quite cutting it anymore.\n\nI will finish this game eventually, but I wish I had started from here, just because I would've enjoyed it more.\n\nRegardless, this game is easily worth the money.","May 18","true","3.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","5","8","2","0"

For some reason, the devs felt like they had to change the combat system and slow down the pacing of the sequel. I am sure the control changes were to appeal to the console market, and it was a big mistake. It completely ruins the game. Not only the controls overly complex and counterintuitive, but they are made worse by a very steep difficulty curve. This combined with the lack of clarity in the storytelling and what is far and away the worst menu system I have ever seen in a game and you wind up with a disappointing shadow of what could have been. I love the story and really wanted to experience it in its entirety, but could not do so due to the game's awful controls, terrible pacing and confusing menus. Also, as much as I like dialogue heavy games, this one overdoes it. Too much of a good thing. I can't count the number of times I've wished an npc would just shut up already. When you can sit down in a game for an hour or two and accomplish nothing, something is very wrong.","June 4, 2014","false","24.0"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

And while you would have thought that better character tree (three separate branches of character development) would deliver better outcome that the first Witcher, it's all irrelevant due to absolutely batshit crazy input lag and lack of direct control over your character. Every move you make, every swing you try to do needs about 0,5-1 second until it's actually performed. You don't really have control on which attack you will actually perform. Will it be a single swing? A pirouette? A chained attack? ♥♥♥♥ you, prepare for a surprise and a possible ♥♥♥♥ up of getting mauled to death by a bunch of monsters if your character decides to perform a fancy attack with jumping and rolling. You can't even cancel your moves, I mean, the ♥♥♥♥ is this ♥♥♥♥? Your ripostes will not activate at random, hey enjoying that 1/3 hp hit already because of some script hicup or other ♥♥♥♥?\nOn a top of that add a really console-centring UI with awful feel on PC. Drinking a single potion is a chore. And this game needs you to care about drugs all the time, so you will enter meditation over and over again (because potions' duration times are significantly nerfed). The animations and transitions between game screens takes more time that the actual draggin potions to drink them.\nIf you decide to delve into an awful crafting system (don't do it), you will start to rip your hairs pretty fast, since the awful auto-aim makes every looting of crates piled one on another a real pain in the ♥♥♥. Are you trying to take just specific ingredients from this pile of chests in somebody's house? Tthere's no thievery system by the way and everyone will be happy for you robbing them from everything they've got - enjoying your immersive story telling yet? Well ♥♥♥♥ you, just take them all together and sell the rest to a vendor for 10 coins for half of your inventory capacity.\nAlso, never do a precise granade/knife aiming, since you will miss 90% of the time, even the knife just went through the guy's head.\n\nI've tried to do a second playthrough before finishing the Witcher 3, but playing this game is like hitting your own balls with a hammer.","November 4, 2015","false","36.8"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","11","20","0","0"

If your rig can push it to the max settings you will see what I´m talking about. Textures and lighting are amazing and performance seems good.\n\nStory\nMore deep decisions to make, harded to decide. Take your time to make any important decision, but take in mind you will also be forced to decide faster in the middle of action. Even your gameplay will affect the plot. i.e sneaking succesfully or not, persuading someone in a dialog, etc\n\nCombat\nFast, hardcore, difficult and variate combat. I last play a game with a controler few years ago. Know I swear you I´m pushing hard my controler to smash and cut all that monsters and foes. Think quickly, cast sign, but also use the environment, and don´t forget to get lots of potions, bombs and oils with you. Know you witcher´s arsenal includes daggers and traps :)\n\nOnce more I strongly recommend reading the novel series and also beating the first game, the story follows up right at the end of the first one.  I will rate this game 9.5/10\n\nYou should play The Witcher series to understand what I´m talking about, you will not regreat it.\n\n","December 31, 2014","true","84.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And for a change it is a game that is not trivially easy to play. You need to actually be on your toes all the time even when on Normal Settings. Though I have never played a game on easy settings, its initial assessment was to play on Easy.\n\nThe story line is hidden with detective type puzzles (not Darksiders type), solving them actually are not straightforward, and very fulfilling in terms of evolving story-line and rewards. (For example there is a  murder, and you can complete it based on partial evidence that points towards the culprit but not exactly incriminate. You can choose to end it there and the quest will end with ... no one will know ... ending.\n\nWell all in all highly recommended, though you'll have to be cautious in terms of playing with kids around for its gruesome brutality depiction, uncensored voice and sexual content.","February 4, 2015","true","115.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The player controls Geralt of Rivia as he trys to uncover the truth behind the events that take place in the beginning of the game.  An expansive story awaits and is effected by the player's actions.  The choices you make really will effect the outcome of events.\n\nPros:\n\nA great and detailed story.  The story is definitely the best aspect of this game.  There are a lot of important characters throughout the game who will shape events as they unfold.\n\nContent.  There is a lot of content here.  Each area has a few side quests in addition to the main story quests.  Even if you just stick to the main quests, the story will take you around 30 hours.  Crafting is also available and can take a considerable amount of time.  If you want a break from the main game, an arena area is available with leaderboards.\n\nCons:\n\nCrafting.  Don't bother trying to craft that really awesome armor set the vendor is selling.  For one, you will probably never get the money to even buy all the recipes.  If you do manage that, it can be quite time consuming to gather all the leather.  Each armor set comes with a sword recipe for your regular and silver sword.  The swords are the worst part of this crafted set.  They are really awesome for the current area, but require you to have the complete set equiped to use.  Each time you move to a new area in the game, the previous armor set recipes become unavailable.  So, if you spent time just crafting the swords and move to the next area, all that time and resources are now gone.  Crafting armor pieces can be pointless as better or equivalent items can be found by simply thoroughly exploring the area or gambling with random NPCs.  Other than potions and enhancements, crafting is just a waste of time.\n\nCombat.  Although Geralt has access to a few spells in addition to swords, the combat is rather simple.  You can easily play the entire game just slashing as fast as you can and dodging away.  You can parry your opponent by waiting for them to attack, but this locks your character in place and is not advisable when taking on multiple opponents.  Since basically every fight has you facing multiple opponents, parrying can leave you open.\n\nStory Presentation.  The story is pretty good, but sometimes it is not presented very well.  The player mainly controls Geralt but at times will very briefly control a side character.  This can happen at random times and can be better handled by just showing a cut scene.\n\nTech Issues.  The audio in the game is all over the place.  Sometimes character dialog will be very loud and other times a wisper.  I also did not care for the narrator's voice when transitioning to new areas.  When I had a lot of saves the game would continually crash when trying to load.\n\nLevel Design.  The world consist of mainly tight corridors with very little open space.  It would have been nice to have more room to roam around.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe Witcher 2 presents a great story in a not so great way.  The levels feel claustrophobic, the combat can be very simple, and the crafting can be pointless.  If you put that aside, this is still a pretty good game.  There is a deep story here that can be guided by the player.  If you haven't played a serious RPG in awhile and are looking for something decent, play this.\n\nScore: 8.1 / 10","July 12, 2014","true","53.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Even though the game is from 2011, it has more impressive graphics than a lot of games from 2014.\n\nGraphics is one thing, but is the game any good? The answer to that is, yes! It is indeed worth your while if you like hack and slash, and you like flying around in combat, like batman, then this is really a game for you. The combat is amazing, and challenging. If you don't think it's hard, then just crank the difficulty up a notch. I'm sure it will give you plenty of challenge.\n\nThe game also has a lot of story, but you really need to have played the first one in order to understand what it is about, and who the characters are. Is the game then still playable? Definitely! If you liked any of the things above, this is worth every penny.\n\nBe advised though, there is a lot of "sexual conflict" in this game, where it will be common to see nudity, sex scenes and go to a lot of brothels. So if you aren't into that, then that's it, but I wouldn't say that the nudity overshines the game itself.\n\nThe only real complaint I have about this game, is that there will be items in the game, that you may not be able to get, cause you have to, have kept an item that you collected at the start of the game in order to get a weapon at the end of the game. This can be a problem as you have to sell sometimes, and nothing is telling you to not sell these particular items, that you need for an item later on. However, this should not ruin the game later on, as you don't necessarily need these items to complete the game. But it's still worth noting, if you like collecting these things.\n\nThis is one of the best titels from 2011 and I'm sure it wont disappoint you. I give "The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings" a 9/10","June 23, 2014","true","42.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The 3rd will be out soon and the support for it is astounding.\n\nI've fallen in love with Geralt of Rivia, a witcher, which are an order of people who were genetically modified as children to be faster, stronger, more resilient humans who can cast spells called signs to help with combat. They are monster hunters who stay neutral (or try to) through out their adventures.\n\nGeralt is also the desire of pretty much every chick he runs across. He gets a lot of tail. Tastefully of course. But seriously this guy is a bush master.\n\nSo, the main combat style is sword fighting, which he is VERY good at, in many different ways.\nThroughout the game, you're forced to make choices, which change the game in significant ways and give you different outcomes and endings. It's similar to Fallout or Mass Effect in this way. It still has a linear story line, with optional and required sub storylines.\n\nIt's written beautifully.

After playing out the begining of this game I immediately deleted my save and bought The Witcher so that I could know the story from the begining (and get the perks of uploading a save file but from what I understand it's that that big of a deal.)\n\nGeralt is a mutant that slays monsters and any who would harm humanity, for a price. It is a fun game that at times can be tedious and confusing but it's a RPG. You hack and slash using spells and potions to complete quest. playing from game one you have amnesia (not a spoiler as it's the first thing mentioned in both games) and you're are finding yourself as much as solving the questions that arise as you travel.\n\nAs stated I haven't finished but I'm getting there and this game is beautiful, fun, challenging, and immersive. I recomend it to everyone. There are occasionally some issues on the development side (sometimes a game can randomly crash on you so save often) but I find that even with these issues I'm happy to just open back up and continue.","August 23, 2014","true","14.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has a very entertaining story, badass characters, and hilarious dialogue, but it lacks the most important thing about a game... GAMEPLAY. It's the same problem with Bioshock Infinite for me. The gameplay is awful compared to how amazing the story and the world is. Witcher 2 truly does have a wonderful world. But the combat is so boring. Geralt likes to telegraph the ♥♥♥♥ out of his own attacks, spending two seconds just winding into an attack, and taking another two seconds to get out of it. This makes any fights that aren't one on one nearly impossible, turning them into ridiculous chases where I might take a stab at one enemy before getting hit, losing most of my health, and running in circles again. And then in one on one fights, you stagger lock your enemy to death. The combat is just boring. Plain and simple. Not to mention the awkward sex scenes that this game has to cater to the lonely "PC mustard race" weirdos that did nothing but make me feel uncomfortable.\nAlso the UI is ♥♥♥♥ing atrocious and too complicated for a video game. There's a fine line behind spending time to learn a game and wasting time to figure out problems that could have been fixed easily.\nI think you'd need to heavily consider this game before buying it. It is not for anyone with even the slightest amount of "casual" in them.\nIt's a damn shame, because the one cutscene of King Foltest's assassination was enough to push me through a couple hours of dying over and over. It's so ♥♥♥♥ing badass at times, but it's hidden under boring and clunky combat.\n>>>>EDIT<<<<<<<<<<\nSo I gave the game another shot, and I have changed my view completely. The game is about patience. It is difficult. It punishes rushing through things. Combat is a lot better than I made it out to be. Enemies do have generally a lot more health than you do, or they deal more damage than you do, but it is actually pretty fun. The combat and such are above satisfactory to me, but what really wins is the story, the dialogue, the environment, the world itself. The enemies are diverse, there's A LOT of stuff to do, but sidequests aren't just shoved into your face. It's actually a wonderful game, but my original statement of witcher not being for anyone with "casual" in them holds true; this game requires dedication, and what you get out of it is definitely worth it.\nALSO, THIS GAME QUITE POSSIBLY HAS SOME OF THE BEST DECISION MAKING AND DRAMATIC EVENTS EVER. As I stated in the comments section of this review, few games have made me smile stupidly like the witcher in how giddy I felt over certain actions/events/dialogue options. Cutscenes are also top notch. I'm SO glad I gave it another chance.","July 17, 2014","true","17.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","7"

With absolutely zero hand holding and possibly the best cinematic storytelling I've ever seen, the game provides an experience like no other. When you play this game, you will never see halos or devil horns telling you whether the decisions you make are "good" or "evil". The game simply presents choices and consequences, so it is ultimately up to the player to decide what path they decide to take, and quite often the the lines between what is right and wrong can become muddled and even downright inconclusive to the player, making for some extremely thought-provoking scenarios and questlines. This is bolstered by the fact that the game has dozens of major choices throughout that, with each, will have a significant impact on the story, making for so many ways to play through the game.\n\nAs I mentioned, the game will almost never hold your hand. This means you will not have waypoints all over your screen telling you exactly where to go constantly. Often times, when undertaking quests, you will need to read over your journal or revisit certain characters to obtain information on where to go or what to do next, and use your intuition along the way. This type of approach gives almost the whole game the feeling of a challenge, rather than just a mundane routine. This along with other things can easily put off several people from this game who are looking for a more casual experience, as it is definitely a game for people who like to think and analyze. Possibly the biggest offput for some people may be the tutorial that the game starts off with, as it is quite bad. Getting used to the combat and inventory systems(which is also not the best at times) can be difficult, but if you can overcome that you are in for an amazing experience.","February 12, 2014","true","63.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The Witcher 2 takes place where our favorite witcher, Geralt of Rivia, left off. I highly recommend playing the first one. It carries over weapons, armor, and depends on how you look at it, the signs (You actually have to find them in the first Witcher).

Both the good, such as KOTOR, and the bad. Yes, I'm looking at you Mass Effect 3. I wouldn't consider myself a hardcore RPG player, but this has to be one of the best games I've ever played.\n\nFirst, the game itself is more of an action game with RPG elements. In this regard, it is a lot like ME, where all combat is realtime, and you aren't going to swing at someone, obviously hit them, and be told you missed, unlike its predecessor (although the first Witcher had miss animations). The gameplay is solid, and not quite like Mass Effect in that you have to keep moving instead of staying in cover. One nice thing is that you can glance at the lower left-hand corner to see the last few attacks and defends with their corrosponding damages.\n\nNext, the story is just plain awesome. I can't say much, other than while it was well written, the story is a bit on the shorter side, but no matter, as there are enough areas to explore and quests to finish to keep you playing for a long time.\n\nAlso, the graphics are gorgeous, especially for 2011. They are, infact, much better than most games today.\n\nFinally, I'd say that if there is ANYTHING to complain about with this game, it would be that you cannot edit video settings or controls outside of the launcher. However, this is a minor complaint, and can easily be overlooked.\n\nVerdict: This game is a must have. As of the writing of this review, the game is only $4.00. I would gladly pay $40 for a game this well made.\n\nPS. For those of you who decide this game is worth the money. CD PROJEKT RED left a little "surprise" in the games files, concerning Triss Merigold. Let's just say many of you GUYS out there will probably be pleased with it, if you know what I mean...","August 15, 2014","true","46.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","5"

The fact that this game is more difficult than other RPG's (even on easy) makes it that much more fun. You cannot charge your way and roflstomp enemies, being outnumbered is dangerous and getting hit can certainly be unforgiving. A little spice of difficulty and realism too, I suppose. No Rambo crap...\n\nTo sum it up, this game is beautiful from top to bottom. Great audio & visual fidelity, great gameplay, great story.

I will be writing an honest review though, focusing on PRO and CON aspects of the game.\n\nPRO\n\n- Re-playability: you will never play this game the same way twice! Every stage of the storyline offers you a great variety of choices that will highly influence the world around you. You will be facing hard decisions, since the very beginning to the very ending of the game.\n\n- Combat system: the combat system of The Witcher 2 is particular and interesting. You will be carrying two swords: a steel one for human targets and a silver blade for monsters. You need to decide which sword to use depending on the enemy you will be facing. In addition to this there is a number of tools, traps, ranged weapons you can use, potions you can drink that have to be prepared before the battle. Depending on the enemy you must, then, think at the perfect strategy to defeat it!\n\n- Customization: upon leveling up you gain one point you can spend on one of the four perk paths: Witcher, Swordsmanship, Magic and Alchemy. You have to complete the first one to unlock the other three (which is not a problem). You can add a perk in every path regardless of the initial choice, but the more you advance in a path, the better abilities you will gain, it is another decision you have to take! :)\n\n- Graphics: playing the Witcher 2 at max graphic renders you utterly speechless, the details, the motion blur, the texturing and modeling is almost flawless considering it is a 2011 game.\n\n- Arena mode: this mode offers you lots of new hours of gameplay. You will have to kill waves of enemies, and with every wave completed you gain perk points and currency to improve yourself in order to face the next wave. Score, then, can be registered to compare it with other players.\n\nCON\n\n- Diffuculties gap: the easiest difficulty may make you finish the game even without the need of adding perks. Almost every enemy can be killed by normal sword slashes, while the hardest mode is an incredibly challenging mode. There is not a real midpoint.\n\n- Identical NPCs: hardly you will find NPCs with their own unique features, apart from the characters you will interact with during the main storyline. Sometimes clothes and outfits are different, but the face model is the same. There are few base models being used in different towns (poor woman, poor man, noble woman, noble man, dwarf, male elf, female elf etc).\n\nI definitely recommend this game, especially now that The Witcher 3 will be released next year. It is an amazing way to get familiar with the Witcher world, lore and system!\n","July 15, 2014","true","5.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The story is this game's saving grace. It has kept me interested with plenty of intrigue, likable characters, well written dialouge, and real consequences for choices. However the gameplay is trash. I have never felt like a witcher once while playing this game. Unless witchers go through all those mutations and years of training made them experts at kiting enemies, taking one swing then rolling away. The challenge of enemies in the first witcher came from not understanding them, you could then take time to study them and learn how to defeat them. In this the challenge never seems genuine. The game doesn't reward hard work, learning your enemies weakness, then exploiting it; it only rewards patience. Do you have the patience to slowly chip away at this boss or that group of enemies while kiting them around the area? Watch a LP or a let's Watch if you don't want to have to supress the urge to uninstall the game.

Assasins of Kings offers all that the first Witcher game offered and even more.\n\nGraphics\nStunning visuals, really, the most impressive graphics I ever seen, even for 2014 standard. If your rig can push it to the max settings you will see what I´m talking about. Textures and lighting are amazing and performance seems good.\n\nStory\nMore deep decisions to make, harded to decide. Take your time to make any important decision, but take in mind you will also be forced to decide faster in the middle of action. Even your gameplay will affect the plot. i.e sneaking succesfully or not, persuading someone in a dialog, etc\n\nCombat\nFast, hardcore, difficult and variate combat. I last play a game with a controler few years ago. Know I swear you I´m pushing hard my controler to smash and cut all that monsters and foes. Think quickly, cast sign, but also use the environment, and don´t forget to get lots of potions, bombs and oils with you. Know you witcher´s arsenal includes daggers and traps :)\n\nOnce more I strongly recommend reading the novel series and also beating the first game, the story follows up right at the end of the first one.  I will rate this game 9.5/10\n\nYou should play The Witcher series to understand what I´m talking about, you will not regreat it.\n\n","December 31, 2014","true","84.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The player controls Geralt of Rivia as he trys to uncover the truth behind the events that take place in the beginning of the game.  An expansive story awaits and is effected by the player's actions.  The choices you make really will effect the outcome of events.\n\nPros:\n\nA great and detailed story.  The story is definitely the best aspect of this game.  There are a lot of important characters throughout the game who will shape events as they unfold.\n\nContent.  There is a lot of content here.  Each area has a few side quests in addition to the main story quests.  Even if you just stick to the main quests, the story will take you around 30 hours.  Crafting is also available and can take a considerable amount of time.  If you want a break from the main game, an arena area is available with leaderboards.\n\nCons:\n\nCrafting.  Don't bother trying to craft that really awesome armor set the vendor is selling.  For one, you will probably never get the money to even buy all the recipes.  If you do manage that, it can be quite time consuming to gather all the leather.  Each armor set comes with a sword recipe for your regular and silver sword.  The swords are the worst part of this crafted set.  They are really awesome for the current area, but require you to have the complete set equiped to use.  Each time you move to a new area in the game, the previous armor set recipes become unavailable.  So, if you spent time just crafting the swords and move to the next area, all that time and resources are now gone.  Crafting armor pieces can be pointless as better or equivalent items can be found by simply thoroughly exploring the area or gambling with random NPCs.  Other than potions and enhancements, crafting is just a waste of time.\n\nCombat.  Although Geralt has access to a few spells in addition to swords, the combat is rather simple.  You can easily play the entire game just slashing as fast as you can and dodging away.  You can parry your opponent by waiting for them to attack, but this locks your character in place and is not advisable when taking on multiple opponents.  Since basically every fight has you facing multiple opponents, parrying can leave you open.\n\nStory Presentation.  The story is pretty good, but sometimes it is not presented very well.  The player mainly controls Geralt but at times will very briefly control a side character.  This can happen at random times and can be better handled by just showing a cut scene.\n\nTech Issues.  The audio in the game is all over the place.  Sometimes character dialog will be very loud and other times a wisper.  I also did not care for the narrator's voice when transitioning to new areas.  When I had a lot of saves the game would continually crash when trying to load.\n\nLevel Design.  The world consist of mainly tight corridors with very little open space.  It would have been nice to have more room to roam around.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe Witcher 2 presents a great story in a not so great way.  The levels feel claustrophobic, the combat can be very simple, and the crafting can be pointless.  If you put that aside, this is still a pretty good game.  There is a deep story here that can be guided by the player.  If you haven't played a serious RPG in awhile and are looking for something decent, play this.\n\nScore: 8.1 / 10","July 12, 2014","true","53.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Dialog options and overall writing bits are great. Beautiful atmospheric graphics (on ultra if you have the PC to back it up it's one of the most beautiful looking games, though it looks fine on medium so no worries)\n\nThe only downside is the third act which is a bit underwhelming from a story and gameplay perspective.

Highly recommend, especially for RPG fans. The beginning can be a little slow and that could be because the combat takes alittle while to get going. Get pass Act 1 and it really does open up and become alot more enjoyable. Don't be afraid to turn down the difficulty on your first playthrough because you will die alot.\nThis game is all about grey choices and if you are tired of good/evil choices alot of these RPG games throw at you then you will enjoy (and hate) some of the choice you have to make, some of which doesn't always become apparent at the time you made it.\nGraphic wise this game is gorgeous. I recommend turning off blur effect, depth of field, motion blur and possibly bloom (if you dont want to go blind). Just my recommendation but with those options on, i find the game a blurry mess.

As if the eye candy wasn't enough, the story is incredible.  It's quite involved, and all of your decisions carry weight, weather it be possitive or negative.  And the soundtrack. Holy ♥♥♥♥, the soundtrack. What a masterpiece. Filled with emotion and beauty, forboding and danger. Compliments the game perfectly and makes for an experience that most games can only hope to accomplish.\n\nVery few games have been able to grab a hold of my moral compass and really force me to think about potential outcomes like this one.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AmbiguousUrl/recommended/20920/","AmbiguousUrl","Weeaboo Jones","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AmbiguousUrl/","286 products in account","This game is one of my favorite RPGs of all time. It has a really strong and compelling narrative and offers you plenty of chances to make choices that feel like they have some weight to them, though, perhaps not as much as the first game. The characters are mostly interesting, and the character development is definitely there. One of my favorite things about the story and characters is the moral ambiguity of it all. There is no clear distinction of good and evil between any of the sides. Simply two perspectives of what's right. The combat feels pretty fluid and I greatly enjoyed it. I liked how alchemy worked in the game, too. It's unnecessary in the first two difficulties, but in the higher ones, you'll find yourself greatly crippled if not using it. You cannot use potions in combat, so that adds some strategy to it. The game is absolutely beautiful on ultra settings, and it still looks pretty great even on lowers ones. The environment does at least. Nothing seems out of place in the world, the enemies are well designed and plenty creepy at times. They did a great job crafting the world.\n\nThat doesn't mean it's without its issues, though. The combat does seem pretty fluid, but in higher difficulties you'll find yourself rolling endlessly across the ground with your foes in hot pursuit. Blocking is often times useless, and there is very noticeable input lag on occasion. There's also a noticeable disparity between easy and normal difficulties. Easy being ridiculously so, and normal for new players likely quite challenging in the beginning. Also, though I enjoyed how alchemy works, it also leads to an obvious issue that can break the fluidity/immersion of the game. Since you can't use potions outside of battle, this leads most people to entering a fight to see which potion they should use for which resistances or buffs, loading a quicksave, and then using the potion. I love the idea and how it fits into the Witcher lore, but it needs some work. Also, either a pro or a con depending on your preferences, but it's not really an open world, and there's very few side-quests. You go from hub to hub, each having a few explorable zones mainly comprised of small passages. As far as the side-quests go, there's around 8 or so for the first 2 acts, I believe. Not really all that many. It leads to it being a fairly short game as far as RPGs go. Mentioning the choices again, I loved how they were worked into the game and they did "feel" weighty, though they didn't really mean much. You still end up in more or less the same situations with the same people doing the same things.\n\nAnd then there's the much touted "Maturity" of the game. Yes, it may be much more so than many other RPGs, and it's definitely a dark game. The moral ambiguity definitely plays into this as well. With that said a lot of said "maturity" seems to stem from the idea that sex jokes are funny and adult. The characters way to often bring up "ploughing", at times it seems like every other sentence, though it's not really. It comes across as juvenile and cheap. There's mature themes throughout the game, though a lot of the perception of that seems attributed to the sexed up atmosphere. At least they removed the sex cards from the first game.\n\nI probably missed quite a few things, this is just some stuff that came to mind. Might edit it on occasion.\n\nI still recommend this game overall. It is quite enjoyable and the Witcher 3 is looking like a great game, so jumping into the series before that would probably be a good idea. It's on sale quite often, and even if not, it is easily worth $20 when it's not.","May 26, 2014","true","50.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ballzac314/recommended/20920/","ballzac314","ballzac314","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ballzac314/","128 products in account","So, I just finished this game. Ignore the time it says I've played, that 2 hours is the time I spent trying to get the steam version to work. Thankfully, CDPR provides a GoG code for the DRM free version when you buy the steam one, so I ended up using that. (ETA: After playing through once on "hard", I decided to play through on "dark". Then, early on in chapter 1, it stopped detecting input from my xbox 360 controller; all my other games are still working. I thought maybe the configuration was messed up, so I tried to run the launcher, but that is no longer working. I've given up on this. I couldn't get the steam version working at all, and now the GoG version isn't letting me use controller. I still got my money's worth out of it, but be prepared for some possible issues.)\n\nFirst I will say that I really like this game, but I really can't understand how so many reviewers have given it 10/10. For me, a rating like that would mean it is flawless, and while TW2 does so much so well, there are also enough flaws to make it an 8/10 at best.\n\nGraphics: A lot of people praise this game for the graphics. As with the game in general, there is a lot I like about the graphics, and some things I don't like. There is some variety, and that is nice. You don't feel like they've applied too much of the clone brush on the locations. The people look good from far away; part of this is due to the nice reflections off armour. The faces are okay, but not so great for a game that came out several years after Crysis. There seem to be only half a dozen different faces in the game apart from the main characters. My biggest gripe with the graphics is that the colours (particularly the yellows) are blown out. I like high saturation, but when light shines on objects, the colours blow out so much that you no longer see detail in the texture. I thought it was bloom, but when I turned bloom off, it only stopped the colours from leaving the edges of the object, not from washing out the object itself. A lot of tweaking of the gamma and brightness can improve it a lot, but it's never perfect, and the default setting is ridiculous.\n\nGameplay: The combat takes a lot of getting used to. At first it felt laggy to me. This is because you cannot change your mind halfway through an action. If you press the attack button before the first attack has finished, it will automatically carry out the second attack. This means you have to be very deliberate about your attacks so that you don't get stuck in a bad move while you are being attacked. You cannot mash buttons with this game, and I grew to love this style of combat after a few hours of playing. There is also a great balance to it that encourages you to use a variety of techniques in a fight and change those techniques for different opponents. One thing I would have preferred is perhaps two magic bars, one for protection signs and one for destruction, or something like that. I found myself only using quen (protection) because if I used my magic for a different sign, I would be stuck without quen when I realy needed it. TW2 starts off quite linear, and I was worried it would stay like that, but thankfully it opens up a bit after the prologue. However, having played skyrim, I can say this game feels very claustrophobic in comparison.\n\nControls: I found a controller to be superior to K&M for this game. Keyboard and mouse may be better for more quickly choosing signs or options, but I found the controller better for combat in general. For some reason, I couldn't change the default bindings (even though it's in the options) and I found two of them in particular annoying: the Lclick and Rclick. Lclick causes you to hold your medallion, and this makes you vulnerable. Frequently in battle, I would push too hard on the left stick trying to dodge an attack and accidentally use my medallion. I would have much preferred this to be on the right stick, or perhaps down on the D-pad, which I don't think was used for anything else other than menus. Rclick is to centre view; seriously, who uses that. Left stick could have then been for autosave (wasn't binded, so I either had to use the keyboard or go through the menus.)\n\nStory: I must admit that I don't normally pay attention to the story in games, so I don't have much to compare it to, but I managed to sit through every cut scene and follow what was going on, which is rare for me.\n\nStyle: I really like that they don't shy away from the realities of life; drunk soldiers ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in the streets, swearing, brothels, sex and nudity. It's a refreshing change from all these games that happily have you gunning down masses of innocent people, but pretend people don't have breasts. Apart from that, it's fairly typical of the genre. Perhaps leaning towards the medieval realism a bit more than other games, but still plenty of fantasy elements.\n\nAnnoyances: While most of these are fairly minor, there are enough annoyances in the game to drag its score down a bit for me...\n\nQTEs during cutscenes! No excuse for this. I'm not a big fan of QTEs, but I'm okay with the ones in minigames (e.g. a fistfight). But when I've just beaten a really difficult enemy and it goes to a cutscene, don't flash a QTE up on the screen while the controller's on my desk and I'm having a bite of my dinner.\n\nDoor animations. I don't know who thought it would be a good idea to have an animation of you walking through open doorways, but there were a few points in the game where I got stuck in the animation and died while trying to evade enemies. Also, doors seem to have the camera attached to them rather than the character when you open the door to go through them. This can be disorienting and can cause you to go in the wrong direction.\n\nActions associated with camera rather than character. Basically, if you are running past an item and miss the symbol to pick it up, you can't turn the character around to get the option to pick it up again, but instead have to turn the camera around. This feels unnatural to me. In addition to this, it is really finicky in that you have to be in exactly the right position to get the prompt. This can make it a chore to try to pick up items. There was also a particular door that I had to go through lots of times, and would end up always looking at a poster that was right next to it rather than opening the door.\n\nAccidentally taking off clothes. You can look through items in the inventory without actually selecting them. It starts off with the stuff you are wearing selected, and it's not that easy to tell what is selected. I would frequently search through the inventory, find what I wanted to use, click "a", and it would take my boots off or something.\n\nGlitches. There were a few times in the game where the next thing that was meant to happen wouldn't happen. I would spend ages trying to work out where the rest of the soldiers I'm meant to defeat are, before looking up a walkthrough and finding out that I'd beaten them all and something was meant to happen. I also learnt that if you are following someone and they have an epileptic fit at the next door, something has gone wrong. There were at least half a dozen times throughout the game that I had to go back to an earlier checkpoint to proceed.\n\nAll in all, a really great game. The combat, in particular, is something I grew to love. But there are enough annoyances in the game to severely impact it, and I would not be willing to give it more than 8/10.","May 30, 2014","true","2.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shalere/recommended/20920/","shalere","Lazehawk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shalere/","207 products in account","I'm not typically compelled to review games I purchase on Steam, but the Witcher 2 so thoroughly surprised me I had to say something.\n\nI had long avoided the Witcher series out of dislike for the apparently cliche main character, but as there was an absence of good RPGs to play this summer I picked them up during the sale on a lark. The first game I played a couple chapters of, but ultimately couldn't get into it; I had played Neverwinter Nights to death earlier in my life, and the similarities of the Aurora engine were just so strong that I found myself burnt out.\n\nSo I booted up the Witcher 2. I was instantaenously amazed by the graphics, despite the game's age. The visual fidelity worked to support what felt like a living, breathing world, and within the first hour I was already hooked on the story. The characters, while suffering from stiff facial animations, are backed up by well-written dialogue and quality voice-acting. There is a moment early in the game where Geralt re-unites with his companions in an inn and, while the "party meeting around a table" is a genre staple, the presentation was so well done I felt like I was in a Lord of the Rings scene.\n\nThe game's mechanics aren't quite as engrossing as its narrative. The combat is servicable, and feels smooth and well-animated for the most part; targeting hitches, stiff dodging, and difficulty landing magic attacks do weigh down the experience. Likewise, the inventory management and map menus are frustratingly clumsy given their importance to the game. The combat, movement, and interface were all clearly designed for a gamepad, but I found the radial quick-menu lacking in precision; often, I had to resort to the d-pad to navigate, rather than just flicking a stick in the required direction.\n\nThese quibbles can be just enough to pull you out of the game for a little longer than you'd like, but the environments and the story will always pull you back in. It's not open-world in the sense that Skyrim is; areas have defined (though branching) paths through them. Thankfully they are laid out naturally enough to stop you from feeling like you're on a theme-park ride dictated by arbitrary invisible fences and, while your mileage may vary, I found that the relatively rigid environment was offset by the narrative freedom. You may not be able to go everywhere you can see, but nowhere you go feels empty or lifeless.\n\nLastly, just to address the issue that initially put me off this series; no, there is no character creation. Geralt is Geralt: You can't make him an elf or dwarf, or change his class or gender, or give him a haircut. You can allocate points to swordsmanship, magic, or alchemy, but you'll still always be a Witcher. But as the decisions you make start to shape the world around you, he will very much start to feel like your character, and in ways much more significant than a different name or appearance could provide.\n\nTo sum it all up: This is a well-polished and engrossing game with a strong narrative, visuals that are both technically and artistically beautiful, and a world so well-realized that even accidentally unequipping your pants for the 20th time can't take away from it. If you think you might have even the slightest interest in trying this game, buy it. You will fall in love.\n\n","June 22, 2014","true","23.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
