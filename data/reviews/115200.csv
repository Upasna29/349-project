"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Razoronemorar/recommended/115200/","Razoronemorar","Razor_One|Adolf_Hipster","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Razoronemorar/","45 products in account","BEFORE READING !\nThis is not my fix solution, Thrawn wrote this, i'm just making sure it stays alive so everyone can fix it.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197983716155\n\nCossacks 2 Fix\nSo I have had a ton of trouble since buying this game on a whim. Didn't know anything about it. Suffice it to say, the Steam version does not work on all PC's. I've got a Gateway FX gaming laptop and can run any game on the market so my specs are fine.\n\nHere is my work around for Cossacks after much finagling. I hope this helps you guys.\n\n1. You need the C2_Patch_v1_2.exe (google that exact thing and download it)\n2. Download Universal Extractor (google it and download it\n3. Use Universal Extractor to extract the C2_Patch_v1_2.exe patch into any file you want on your desktop\n4. Copy and paste extracted patch into the root folder for Cossacks 2 c:/programfiles(x86)-Steam-steamapps-common-Cossacks II Napoleonic Wars\n5. Run game using startengine.exe button in root folder\n\nThis may be all you need to get it to work. However if you get the error\n'Engine.exe has detected, that video memory is not configured properly. Please restart computer and set AGP Aperture size-256 Mb or more in BIOS configuration program."\nyou need to do another couple of steps\n\n6. Download the c2-hoae-3d-patch.zip and copy and paste its contents into the same root folder the first patch went in and run the game using the startengine.exe button\n\n\nO.k. now the game works but I can't save a file (smh why would steam allow this to be sold when its so broken?)\n\n1. Go to the root folder.\nc:/programfiles(x86)-Steam-steamapps-common-Cossacks II Napoleonic Wars\n2. If there is no folder named 'Save' then create a folder named 'Save'\n3. If there is a folder named 'Save' open it and delete any folders inside it (possibly says 'camp' not sure)\n4. Remove the "Read-only" status from the Cossacks II Napoleonic Wars folder\n-Do this by right clicking on the folder, select properties, deselect 'read-only' and hit apply (may need to do this every time you play the game...I have for some reason.)\n\n\nThis helped me for now. If I find other bugs and work around I'll post them here. But this is seriously pathetic and I'm filing a complaint to Steam. A game that does not work shouldn't be sold.\n\n\nEdit 1:\nThe "Too many handlers" error seems to happen only on certain missions. My only work around is save often and beat mission as fast as possible to continue playing.\n\nEdit 2: (omfg)\nSome of the text in the game is German. Specifically building/unit names and descriptions while everything else is in English. To fix this\n1. Go to root folder\nc:/programfiles(x86)-Steam-steamapps-common-Cossacks II Napoleonic Wars\n2. Open 'Text" folder\n3. Delete file mdlist(2).txt (make sure its the one that says (2))\n\nThis fixed the problem for me. Apparently some German language files may find their way into your text folder through the screwy patch system. If this file does not exist you will have to just look through every file till you find the German stuff and delete it.\n\n","December 15, 2015","true","8.6"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","14","14","2","0"

Sounds like Shia is writing this review but he wouldn't be wrong this game is awesome. The game is fun and user friendly and although dated I kinda still like the style. Now you may see many reviews saying stuff along the lines of "the first one was better" or "down with the patriarchy" ignore those. The only way to see whether or not you will like this game is to try it, go and pirate it and try the game out. Then, if you are a good person and like the game you can buy it.\n\nAnyway on to the actual review.\n\nThe game itself is nice and has a bunch of different nations to chose from (being from the UK I play British) but there are many other good nations to chose from such as France, Poland, Austria, Spain, Rhineland, Russia and a bunch more! Each one has strengths and weaknesses, such as the British have great infantry and rifleman squads but lack great cavalry.\nThe game-play plays out like any generic RTS, build a base and all that until you realise you cant get all the resources yourself...\nThere are towns located across the maps that you must capture to gain the resources such as gold, food, iron and coal.\nWithout these you will lose, for example with no coal you will not be able to shoot. At all. So its rather important that you keep a stockpile and don't shoot unless you need to. The towns also make the combat more centralised which can lead up to some cool big battles.\nThe only gripe I have with this game is that the multiplayer is dead as it is an old game so unless you know some people who own it you will have to play single player which while fun for a while, you will bore after a while.\nThere is also a very limited amount of maps, and they can get boring after a while, especially if you are playing with multiple players as they are even more limited.\n\nAll in all I like this game and you should too (and if you don't its Obama's fault)","August 18, 2015","true","1.1"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","10","11","3","0"

If you are a true RTS fan then you'll love this game, probably my favorite for this time period.  Yes graphics are dated, but who cares when the stratagy is this good.  Graphics take very little if anything away from the game.  Units are easy to move and control, moving around the map could be a little better but not a deal breaker.
