They’ve been in the Adventure game business since 1985. Post Mortem was released around 2002 and is the prequel to the Still Life series but, it is rather dated now. After looking through the other reviews of this game, I see a few people have had some problems running this game. I have a Windows 7 64bit Gaming Machine and everything runs fine. Yea, I know, why am I using a Gaming Machine for an Adventure game? I have plenty of great games but, there comes a time when I get tired of killing zombies and such. I like Adventure games and I have about 15 of them. Post Mortem is nothing special. The graphics and sound are typical for that time period. It has a great story line as you play a PI in this Murder Mystery. It’s a little different from the other Adventure games that I’ve played in the past. There’s not a whole lot of searching and collecting objects, you mostly interview suspects, extract clues and try to put the pieces together to solve the crime. I recommend you Save your game before any conversation because if you ask the wrong questions, you may miss out on some of the vital clues. There are also several different ways to end the game. Post Mortem has some interesting puzzles throughout the game. There are a few towards the end that are quite challenging. If you get stuck, a true adventurer will put the game down for a while and think about it but, you can also look for a Walkthrough, there are several on the Internet. A word of warning, you cannot toggle between the game and the Walkthrough without the game crashing. And for the love of God, don’t sit there and play the game with the Walkthrough in front of you, I mean, what’s the point? I saw in one of the reviews that a player completed the game in so many minutes. Sit back and enjoy the game, live it. On a scale of 1 – 10, I give the game a 4.5. I recommend the game only to true adventurers. Catch the game on sale like I did at Christmas 2013 on Steam. I bought the Still Life series, Post Mortem, and Scratches real cheap, and I’m glad to have added them all to my collection.","November 19, 2014","true","10.2"," 27 of 28 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","27","28","0","0"

At first, you will be turned-off by the dated graphics and no video resolution options.  OK, I cut them some slack cause its a 2002 release.  What drew me over was the game's storyline.\nHere, you play as a Private Investigator and hired to solve a Murder Mystery. I get to use my detective skills, in a manner of speaking, and try to solve a crime.  In order to catch the murder suspect, you have to arrange the questions you pick in order to extract more vital clues.  If you don't choose carefully and just choose randomly, your conversation might end up making no sense at all or even awkward.\nThere are puzzles here and there, too few and far in between.  The hard ones of course are placed in the end and you might even end-up looking through walkthroughs.\nThere are several shocking cinematic cutscenes in this game.  Some of them are a little too morbid too describe here, like in a "I.S.I.S." kind of way.\nThis game made me a fan of adventure games even more.  I really appreciate game developers who offer great mystery games for us to solve and crack.\nI am running the game on Windows 7 64 bit and it runs well.  However, do not press Alt-Tab because it will crash your game.  I forgot to save my progress at one time, and press Alt-Tab, as a result I have to interview the same characters all over again.  So, if you want to run other pragrams save your game first.\nBy the way, according to other reviews, there are 3 endings to this game.  I only managed to crack 2 of 3 endings at present.  I only recommend this game to those who really like adventure games and can look beyond the mediocre graphics.  If you are, then I suggest you put down your weapons like guns, swords, bow and arrows, or what have you, and try this game for a change.","April 9, 2015","true","8.4"," 22 of 22 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","22","22","2","0"

Multiple endings make the game interesting to play a few times, but there are difficulties in finding a walkthrough for my specific playthrough if I get stuck. The way to choose your responses is not ideal, I like to see all of my options at once, and choose one from there, this method of tabs leads me to accidentally say things, changing my intended storyline. The graphics arent perfect, but the story overrides that. Drawing the sketch of the suspect is difficult, some things are too vague to finish the sketch. There have been multiple places I have not been able to complete things that the walkthroughs have instructed me to complete, but I have mostly moved on without those.

Unfortunately, I noticed who was doing the crimes in five minutes. Then you become stuck with making sure you do everything in order or some actions will disappear completely leaving me to start a new game. Plenty of bugs in the game.\n\nMore bugs outside of the game especially with trying to use it on windows 8; before starting the game it had an error saying something about a 3D also once you minimize the game it kept crashing. Thankfully since the game is extremely short, constantly starting over wasn't bad. I probably have a bunch of hours on this game from walking away from it to snack and watch t.v. lol. You can probably finish the game in an hour. Once I reached the end, it felt dry and very unsatisfying. So i tried to go back and do different things in the game but it was pointless.\n\nOverall the game was interesting but you can definitely save yourself money and time because it is just not worth it.","July 13, 2014","false","15.7"," 19 of 31 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","19","31","0","0"

If you were a fan of Still Life, then you probably could neglect all issues (technical and gameplay wise) that you will find here. What I found to be most annoying was that conversations and results in some cases depended on your answers and questions, and in some cases it did not matter. For that reason I was not sure, how important is right selection of answers. Also, in some cases I was able to talk with NPC of things that I still have not discovered which effectively ruined the story line and suprise moments. Try not going ahead of yourself. Make sure you collect all evidence before talking with people as it will effect what they give you back storywise, so you could miss some important parts. Make saves before talking with NPCs so you can revert if you make mistake.\n\nPUZZLES:\nI needed walkthrough in 2-3 points, where I simply could not determine what puzzle is about. Story is too thin and there's just not enough clues to help you "connect the dots". At one point there are 3 puzzles in same room. And I haven't had a clue why was I doing any of them, and how are clues in the room connected to this 3 puzzles. Text that was supposed to help me with one, was just to abstract even to be sure to what that relates. Ability to do things ahead of story adds up to the confusion.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nDiscovering items is extremely easy unless they are hidden. You can usually spot items from the first time you enter the scene. Although if something is on shelf, you should examine shelves thoroughly as you might miss something. To be able to examine something you have to "stand in right perspective". For example, you want to make a closer look on something, it will not work, unless if you're in right spot, and there's one odd spot close to game end. Also, when examining some things, you will have trouble figuring out that there's additional to examine, because nothing points out you should look more closely. This is poorly done. Should be covered in story so you at least know why are you doing something. Through whole game, you will never combine items, so don't bother.\n\n\nImportant tip!\n\nThere are 3 alternative game endings. The end game results, depend on your previous actions, one of them being if you succeded to clear certain suspect in jail from guilt, did you provide ALL evidence. Don't talk with inspector unless you have everything ready. Save before talk, and make inspector to interogate that suspect again. If he does, you succeeded, this leads you to ending #2 and #3. You can later revert to save, not clear suspect of guilt and go for possible endings #1 and #2. Endings also depend on last conversation.","August 6, 2014","false","11.9"," 23 of 40 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","23","40","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nightsmaiden/recommended/46550/","Nightsmaiden","Nightsmaiden","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nightsmaiden/","439 products in account","I like it... for the way I played it. Until bugs.\n\nDespite not being terribly attracted to horror games, I was impressed enough with Syberia to want to see another set of games by the same group, and I decided to start with the "prequel". I sincerely hope the others are better as games, honestly.\n\nBased on the other reviews, I have been pretty much treating this like a more interactive version of a graphic novel; rather than pixel-hunt and flail around in the dialogue trees, I grabbed a guide almost from the start. The small amount of play I did without it, combined with my memory of the beautiful but hard-for-the-wrong-reasons Syberia games, have me very certain that I would not have enjoyed it as much if the plot was delayed by my having to figure out which items matter, which of many logical solutions the game is actually trying for, what odd result will be achieved by certain (non-reversable) dialogue options, etc.\n\nThe graphics are okay, but the majority of the scenery is designed as trompe l'oiel; flat images that (when seen from the right angle) look 3D.  The problem being that even though you can only stand in certain places in each room/area, they didn't re-render the flat scenery, so depending on where you are standing, the graphics can look either very realistic, or like you have stepped into a surrealist painting.  A few key structures in rooms are immune to this, as are any people or objects  you will need to interact with.  It's not game-breaking, but especially combined with a play style that encourages you to look closely at everything, it is very noticeable.  Especially when the scenery includes people.\n\nDespite that, I was enjoying my more-interactive-graphic-novel until I hit a bug where certain (important) documents I had picked up weren't actually readable. :-(  I found there is a thread from a couple of months ago in the Discussions about someone else having the same problem. Until I can solve that, I will definitely not be playing this game any further (as not getting all the story makes this entirely pointless for me), and likely won't be playing the Still Life games, since I really would like to finish the prequel before I play the rest of the series.\n\nSo, for the moment, it would be a bit sadistic of me to recommend the game.  If you are okay with the risk of game-breaking bugs and spending a lot of flail time, go for it; the parts of the game that work are interesting and well-done.  If not, skip this one for a while, until you see posts indicating that the major bugs have been updated out of existence. :shrug:","February 18, 2014","false","5.6"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","13","23","0","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maghook/recommended/46550/","maghook","Maghook","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maghook/","1308 products in account","Imagine if the creative genius, Tommy Wiseau, decided to make his own game. The outcome would be something similar to Post Mortem, yet perhaps slightly more unintentionally entertaining. Two words: Knights Templar. Yes, exciting, another point-and-click adventure game centred around the Knights Templar, sorcery, and eternal life! As if that conspiracy ♥♥♥♥ wasn't milked nearly enough during the '90s and early '00s.\n\nSince there are almost no positive aspects to this game I will do my best to mention the most negative of the negatives:\n\n• The voice actors can't decide if their accents should be French (with the game being set in Paris), or Dutch, or Swedish, or Arabic, or North American. They're absolutely horrendous and they lack any semblance of enthusiasm. It makes Post Mortem an incredibly droning and boring experience. It's so bad that some accents actually change half way through a conversation.\n\n• The conversation panel is oddly arranged. Where most point-and-clicks present their dialogue choices as a list, with every choice in full view, instead you have them separated into tabs here. It's incredibly tedious to read through. Luckily the game automatically chooses the most appropriate tab in order to progress the discussion if you can't be bothered reading through the other many choices.\n\n• The lip syncing to the actor's voices is strangely hilarious. Instead of animating the jaw moving in time with speech, the lips seems to do most of the work. They vibrate and tremble, as if they're flapping in the wind.\n\n• The story is extremely disjointed and redundant. Every character you meet repeats the same things multiple times, not only what they've said one sentence ago but also what other characters have mentioned in previous conversation. It's tough to sit and listen to these completely one-dimensional characters, whose voices hold about as much personality as Kristen Stewart's face holds expression.\n\n• The puzzles are lacking and tend to be quite vague as they go overboard when introduced. The inventory system is a complete cluster♥♥♥♥. You will only be shown around five items at a time, requiring you to scroll horizontally to the next necessary item, one by one. This becomes quite daunting and frustratingly confusing once you've acquired more than a dozen items, as most of them share similar icons and are not sorted in any particular order. There is no option to examine items either, so you play a sort of Russian roulette; clicking on items in order to discover if their contents can be viewed.\n\n• The biggest issue is the amount of times the game has crashed and locked up on me. Remember when Windows or Internet Explorer would lock up and you could paint pictures with the mouse, as the pointer repeatedly imprinted itself on your screen? Yeah, that ♥♥♥♥ happens a lot in this game. You also can't alt-tab, otherwise the game will force close on you, so if there's a program running in the background that minimises Post Mortem you will lose all your progress. I actually can't legitimately exit the game without going through the whole "Post Mortem has stopped responding" thing...\n\nI honestly have no idea how Post Mortem's Metacritic score is so high. I have no idea how it still receives such critical acclaim. To paraphrase Michael Scott from the television show The Office: if I had a computer, with powers of space-time control, and I found the original source code for Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing, Superman 64, and Post Mortem, I would completely wipe Post Mortem from existence twice.","March 22, 2013","false","9.2"," 18 of 33 people (55%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","55","18","33","4","0"

I rather enjoyed the interface, the way the environments are presented, and the voice actors are pretty good. Getting lured in by a good old fashioned murder mystery was pretty much all I needed to want to try it out, and I suggest the same to anyone that wants something different from a hidden gem of a mystery game.\n\nHOWEVER.\n\nFor anyone that wants to play it, you should totally read a FAQ walkthru for the part where you try to break into the crime scene at the Hotel Orphee. There are actually two methods for getting in there, but at the time when i was playing, I thought I was supposed to use a lockpick. Should you use this lockpick on the door to the hotel room, you literally will not be able to beat the game.\n\nNow then. To the game designers, what the hell do you have to say for yourselves? You do know that gamers are generally not very understanding of spiteful game design that leads to a dead end, right? Even Dagger of Amon Ra would at least let you see an ending where your character gets gunned down in her bed, if you made a certain mistake during your investigation. But here, I don't even get the small gratification of having at least won and seen a bad ending, I'm just plain stuck. That's kind of a sign of lazy, incompetant game design.

Despite, it has some strengths that should be commended.  The horror story is strong and the graphics, while dated, do much to support the atmosphere.  The exploration feels paced and open ended enough to give a real sense of private eye work; I found myself going back to talk to NPCs with new information and going back to locations for clues/objects I must have missed.   This repetition, while perhaps a turnoff to some, helped the immersion in my playthrough.\n\nUnforntunately, these assets don't come close to warranting a recommendation.  The aforementioned strong plot is hampered with unconvincing voice acting, mediocre dialogue (perhaps due to translation from the original French), and atrocious dialogue trees that give the player conversational options too early and too late to make any sense.  The inventory interface is convoluted; sometimes objects can be used directly with the environment, othertimes they can only be used when you click on the environment first, and other times still you need to talk to an NPC for them to come into play.   What's worse,  there's no classic adventure game "Nah, I don't want to do that," when you try an unfruitful combination which quickly frustrates.\n\nI only recommend Post Mortem for an academic understanding into what Microids did far better in their Syberia and Still Life titles.","May 7, 2014","false","10.1"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","8","15","0","0"

This is a Microïds adventure game (that should tell you many things) in a pre-rendered first-person, weird panoramic perspective and some human characters superimposed in realtime polygons. They look hilariously awful. What struck me was that for the puzzles, there're sometimes multiple solutions, which seem sometimes to get randomized. That's pretty great, but as with Microïds often, some of the puzzles are pretty much trial and error based and there is one of those police mug shot drawing puzzles where you are given clues and have to get the face absolutely right to proceed. Ugh. Also, the dialogue trees and the protagonist's important diary-keeping journal both glitched badly on my playthrough. It's a bit of a mess, really. It's cool that this game's the prequel to Still Life, though, considering how much more conventional SL is.","September 30, 2013","false","9.3"," 15 of 31 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","15","31","0","0"

However, the game is impossible to get anywhere.  It is a fairly simple interface, look around a room and click on the various clues or people to talk to.  The problem is, you have to do specific tasks in a specific order, and no suggestion as to what tasks or what order to do them in!  So most of the time you are left wandering around going from place to place, hoping to find something you missed clicking on the first time.  When talking to people, you have a choice of what to say to them, but if you don't say the right things in the right order, they won't help you or give you what you need to progress in the game, and whats more, you don't know when you have done or said something wrong or in the wrong order as the game does not say!  Another instance there was a lock to pick, and I managed to get a lock picking set.  However, there were many numerous different combinations to try the picks to open the door - choosing the right combination was like winning the lottery, it was pure luck that you chose the right pick combination!

By the end of the game I was hoping for the characters to shut up with their dialogue already so I can get the hell out.\n\nTo make it simple, here's a little list:\n- The whole atmosphere of the game was bleak, dull and unappealing. Even the cutscenes, which were meant to be dynamic, only managed to make me feel like playing tetris to get any action.\n- I don't know which accent half the cast were trying to pull, but it surely wasn't french.\n- Subtitles not recommended for grammar nazis. You'd have a burnout before the end of the first conversation.\n- The dialogue is really repetitive, and there's no development between the conversation you just had and the remaining dialogue options. It's like having to remind a goldfish with a 10 sec memory that someone had just died.... after they told you about it themselves.\n- The resolution was stuck on HIDEOUS, alt + tab crashes the game and you're most probably going to encounter some peculiar species of bugs that should and hopefully are now enxtinct in more modern games.\n\nSo what did I like about it?\nFirst game where I actually got to use the good old newspaper/key-on-lock-method.\nIn all seriousness, if you want a good murder mystery point&click, get Cognition instead.","January 8, 2015","false","9.2"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

The only flaws this game has is the soundtrack and the option to choose how to proceed in the game. During the isolated areas the soundtrack goes from eerie music to some more up beat music for a brief moment. As if you are listening to a radio getting interference from another station, this small issue could of been fixed. While I like the idea of choosing your own path in the game, upon my first try I got stuck only cause I said the wrong words and found it impossible to progress further. It's not like Heavy Rain where even if you make the wrong choices, the game still progresses towards the end. So I'd recommend walkthrough help and create a few save files in case you mess up on a certain event. With those aside, the game is still playable with the nicely detailed landscapes that do make you feel like you are in Paris before the WW2 era and the plot does keep you interested enough to make you want to play this game to the end.","March 4, 2015","true","10.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is old, so it doesn't look fantastic, but artistically speaking it is ok and rather atmospheric.\n\nThe problem lies in the puzzle and dialogue structure. In relation to the puzzles, if you miss one hidden object, you are stuck. And some puzzles are extremely illogical (e.g. a puzzle with two dial wheels where one wheel is not being used at all). But the even bigger problem is the dialogue: Most conversations simply don't make any sense. Some times you can ask people about things they still haven't mentioned. Other times it would be logical to ask them a relevant question, but you can't. And some times you are stuck with saying something that doesn't make any sense at all; e.g. blaiming right in the middle of a very friendly conversation. And it goes both ways. For instance a hotel manager might end up getting angry and banning you from the hotel. But the next time you meet him, he's friendly and you are free to ask questions and to enter the hotel. The next time you meet him he'll ask you to leave once again. The dialogue structure is simply awful and it wrecks the game. You end up just clicking some random statement because all the options are equally meaningless.\n\nSad, because the game had some potential when it comes to atmosphere and some story elements and characters.","January 19","false","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

I can forgive a game for being dated or unpolished, but not for being so disinteresting or badly presented that I don't even care how it ends.\n\nAt present, I seem to have sprung plot triggers out of order and am unable to continue in the story, but that is more of a relief than an annoyance. The story and characters are so predictable and shallow, the so-called puzzles are so dull, that I can't even be bothered to consult a walkthrough. I can only hope the rest of the Still Life series will be more engaging.","December 20, 2015","false","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I found myself enjoying the game a bit more than I thought I would have, though I do strongly reccomend using a walkthrough while playing otherwise you'll just end up frustrated and confused most of the time. The graphics are bad, but not nearly as bad as I thought they would be, the voice acting could have been better, but it is certainly not the worst I've experienced ( Here's looking at you A New Beginning), there is some slow parts, but the ambiance is really nice and I don't regret that I bought it, even if it was on sale for dirt cheap and in a package deal. I hear the two sequels are much better installments so I look forward to more polished logical game with those.","January 8","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
