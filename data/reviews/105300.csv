The more of a color you remove, the bigger the combo. This review is from a disabled gamer (I only play with a mouse).\n\nhttp://youtu.be/a6Kdsyvsaks\n\nLoading the game, you can easily access options and change the game to Windowed Mode.  Windowed Mode is borderless so you can change windows without exiting the game.  There's multiple resolutions you can set the window too.  It also has Colorblind Mode which adds a symbol in addiction to the blocks color.  Another option I was impressed with was the Mouse Button option that let's you swap each buttons role.  There's also a single option for the mouse but it seemed to be picky on exactly where I cllicked which slowed me down.  I opt'd to keep using  the reversed option.\n\nActual game modes include Classic, Survival, Meditation and Rush.  While most modes do require you to work within various time tables, Meditation is a completely untimed relaxing strategic gameplay.  To play the game, rotate the mass with your left mouse button and place blocks with your right mouse button. Many games actually didn't require much rotation so I completed many levels using only 1 mouse button.\n\nIf you're a mouse user who can left & right click gameplay should be a breeze!  Colorblind gamers should also be fine with colorblind option enabled.  It's actually my favorite way to play.","November 25, 2013","true","77.4"," 84 of 89 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","84","89","0","0"

My first impression was good, I played it for a bit, expected to play more, had it installed forever, yet every time I fire it up, I close it after 5 minutes.\n\nIt's a match 3 game with some 3D tetris elements. The concept is good. The graphics are polished. The music isn't bad. The controls feel annoying at first, but they're actually mostly okay. The problem is, the gameplay doesn't feel satisfying. It expects (and rewards, scorewise) big combos and long term strategy. It also expects you to be fast and responsive. This should theoretically work, in that zen-like way games like this work, but it doesn't. The rythym and pacing feels all off, it feels like the speed jumps from 1,2,3,4,5 to 50 to 150. Once you get into the zone and start planning ahead for later big score combos, it feels like you blink and the game jumps speed, asking you to go for quick, "just don't make a mistake" placement. That may be totally subjective of course, or it could be that the feeling gets exacerbated by the clunky cube placement process. It simply isn't visually always obvious or easy to correctly target the location you want on a constantly rotating cube, which really hurts the game when it picks up speed. People misplace blocks on tetris too, but usually feel it's their fault, here it feels like the cube jumps place three times before you can be sure it's where it should be. By which time the game has jumped two speed gears and you're basically done with.\n\nAgain, not a bad game, in theory. I just never feel like playing it long, because it doesn't feel very enjoyable. The thumbs down is just trying to balance a "very positively" reviewed game, with an 80 something metacritic score that few people seem to actually play much (notice the curiously short play times of the majority of the positive reviewers?). So I'd suggest to approach with caution, and at least play the demo first.","January 14, 2015","false","1.4"," 22 of 27 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","22","27","0","0"

Brutally simple to learn, simply brutal to master, Critical Mass is the kind of game literally anybody can just pick up and waste hours upon hours of their lives playing, all in a vain attempt to top the charts. And don't think for a second I mean any of that in a bad way. Far from it; Critical Mass possesses a fun, addictive quality rivaled only by the likes of Tetris and similar titles.\n\nIn case you still have doubts, bear in mind that this game only costs a measely two bucks, so it won't be a serious dent in your pocketbook even if you turn out to be one of the four or five people globally who don't enjoy it (you know who you are). With that in mind, what do you have to lose? I pride myself for being more discriminating than most when it comes to choosing which games to buy with a rather limited budget, so believe me when I say Critical Mass is a nearly fool-proof purchase!","November 1, 2013","true","3.1"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MoonShark/recommended/105300/","MoonShark","MoonShark","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MoonShark/","574 products in account","As user [FOR]Mica aptly summarized, "Critical Mass can't decide if it wants to be frantic or strategic, and ends up being neither instead of both." If you go too long without making a combo, the block structure starts to rumble (go critical). You only have a few seconds then to make a combo, or only enough time to add a few blocks, but there's no timer or other useful indicator before the sudden explosion. There's also no indicator what the next block color will be, so you can't plan ahead much. If you were hoping to build up a bridge between two widely-spaced blocks for a big combo, well too bad, adding all those blocks in between could make the structure unstable. Even though planning for big combos is way more satisfying and yields a better score, it's like the game makes that awkward and instead pushes you for quick easy combos instead.\n\nWorst of all IMO, the entire soundtrack is 8 measures that repeat over and over forever. It's a soothing trip-hop kind of beat, but ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ it wouldn't have killed the developer to include an actual song or three. Even Tetris had multiple tracks!\n\nSo while the basic match-4 premise of the game and the graphical polish are great (even has a colorblind mode), some of the design decisions need more time in the oven.","July 26, 2014","false","1.2"," 13 of 21 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","13","21","0","0"

From the very first moment you start it, you'll be hooked, and an hour will have passed before you know it. Along with the great core game, the audio and visuals are sublime. After my first session of playing this game, I started looking on Steam for it's soundtrack. The art, as well, is execlent. I haven't spent much time playing it yet, but that's going to change very soon.\n\nMy only issue with this game is that the cubes won't appear if you're using Mac OS and have the in-game overlay turned on. It is, however, a very easy issue to remedy; under your games library, right-click the title, select properties, and disable the in-game overlay.

You start with a vaguely cube shaped pile of blocks and then fire predetermined color blocks onto the mass attempting to connect at least four of a color, causing them to be removed. In it's base mode each fired block causes the mass to grow while matching blocks causes it to shrink. Take too long or fire too many blocks without clearing any and you'll reach critical mass and lose.\n\nThe interesting thing about this game is that at it's heart it seems to want to be a competitive game. In the base mode there are only 10 levels and they have to be completed in one sitting to get a final score and attempt to get on the leaderboard and this leaderboard seems to be what the developers hoped would keep you coming back. Personally I'm not really a fan of this type puzzle game and the competitive aspects are not a draw to me. If you enjoy doing something multiple times in an attempt to hone your skill then this will be well worth the price of entry. If, like me, you're looking for a more encapsulated experience then its probably best to move on.","July 9, 2015","true","0.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

There are some power ups like a time slower and a multiplier, which will come in handy.\n\nOverall the game is really fun, and there are tons of modes to play.

This is because I am a big achievement hunter so when games do things like THIS game does, it really annoys me. At least 5 of the achievements (maybe more, I forget) require you to get to Rank 1 on the leaderboards in each game type as well as the Overall leaderboards. This is impossible through legitimate play as the current Rank 1 players are clearly hackers, so there is no way for anyone to claim those achievments legitimately. If they had weekly or daily leaderboards it would make much more sense. That being the main reason, this game also fails at what it claims to be "action-puzzle." Sure it can be fast paced but it's almost impossible to do extremely well just because the game lends itself to being a slow paced strategic game. You can't see your next block color, it doesn't have any indication how close you are to losing etc. Which are all sort of staples of said action-puzzle games.

Truly and sincerely, it is almost a good game.  I love what it's trying to go for.  Unfortunately, it is a single-player game with a bizarre and unfathomable reliance on having a constant internet connection, apparently in order to enable the leaderboard.  It is physically difficult to play it offline, and the steam forums for it are full of people with various technical problems -- like having the main game interface not load, or the automatic attempt to log in crashing the game.\n\nIt could have used a little more polish.\n\nUnfortunately, the lack of polish extends all the way to the game design, too.  Critical Mass can't decide if it wants to be frantic or strategic, and ends up being neither instead of both.  If you go too long without making a combo, the puzzle swells to take up more and more of the screen, and it gets harder and harder to see what's going on -- which encourages carelessness, which only makes the problem worse.  The timer for how long you can go without making a combo is also significantly too short -- rather than adding intensity to the game, it just stops me from being able to build up any kind of a rhythm.\n\nThere are so many tiny details that counter-productively disrupt eachother, rather than produce a coherent experience.\n\nAll of that said, it's still a really neat idea, and it works well enough to give you a taste for the game they *tried* to make.  I eagerly await either a slightly better-polished copycat game, or a patch that might make Critical Mass feel a little more finished.  I don't regret buying it a bit, but I also don't see myself playing it more than an hour a year, as I periodically forget and remember its existance.\n\nIf there is ever a patch, I will update this review.  Until then, don't pay more than a dollar.","December 27, 2013","false","3.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The player must eliminate all cubes in the game area before reaching "critical mass". Scoring combos will reduce the critical mass level and buy the player some time.\n\nThis game features several play modes. Classic proceeds through several levels of predefined shapes with randomized arrangements. Rush requires the player to remove all the blocks while the score decreases. Survival requires the player to stave off critical mass for a set period of time. Meditation gives the player a set number of blocks to remove with no time limit or failure conditions.\n\nAs far as gameplay goes, scoring a combo does have a good feel to it and the game itself is reasonably polished, however this game fails to get my recommendation. Firstly, the since the game involves a three-dimensional shape, the gameplay often devolves to a guessing game where the player may (or may not) get lucky by placing a cube on a hidden vein of like colored consecutive blocks.  Secondly this game's music is quite literally a 10 second, rather generic, clip on loop. Meditation features a different 10 second clip but the rest are the same. Lumines, another match-four puzzle game, changes the visual style and music as the player progresses which keeps things fresh and interesting.\n\nTo it's merit the game can be played with just the mouse, so if you're looking for a game that can be played with one hand (maybe with a beer in the other hand). Also the developers were thoughtful enough to include a colorblind mode which adds a symbol to each block.\n\nScore: 5/10","December 23, 2013","false","0.8"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

It uses red, orange and yellow (and a bunch of other colors). The issue happens when you want to place one of the three colors, because when you're choosing a "spot" for your block to land, it's done with a transparent representation of that block. That means that red will look orange next to orange, yellow will look orange next to orange and red, and orange will look whatever it damn wants between the two.\n\nIt sounds like a minor nitpick, but it causes you to make mistakes even if you are not colorblind. It's really inexcusable in a color-based puzzle game.","December 2, 2013","false","2.7"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","0"

And that is what you get: A mass of cubes that requires you to match 4 cubes of the same colour to clear the level, and the idea alone is rather fascinating...\n\n...Except that the main mode is basically a time trial mode, where the mass of cubes expands all the time and explodes at "critical mass" level. Once it does that, the whole level restarts and you lose all your previous power-ups.\n\nI find this implementation frustrating, as it never gives you the right breathing room to think about your cube placements. I understand that there is a Zen Mode where you are free to clear cubes at your own pace, but the fact that I can't play through the vanilla ranked mode properly leaves a bad taste to me. If only they have a time limit for each level instead of making the mass of cubes a timed bomb, I would have enjoyed this game much more.","December 2, 2015","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
