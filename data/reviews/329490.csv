Also this version may or may not become obsolete to the newer version out on the PS4 and that this version is a 2 year old port of an Xbox 360 game minus online functionality. Keep in mind that because of this, this is a review more based on a port to Steam and functionality rather than pure game-play elements.\n\nNow let's start with a few positives:\n1) Because this game started out as a fighting game, the combat system has a complex combo system that is incredibly satisfying to pull off.\n2) With the story and arcade mode in the game, it makes for a decent amount of fun for 2-5 hours.\n3) The character progression in this game is done well with spending points into skills and base stats.\n\nBecause I actually do love this game, a lot of the following comes with why this game is such a bad port compared to the other versions of this game, why it's failing/ not worth your time as a PC game in general, and questioning developer decisions.\n\nNow on to the Negatives (It's a lot):\n\nI originally loved this game when it first came out on console and steam. But with nothing but disappointment after disappointment from terrible developer choices, limitations brought to the PC port, and bugs that are still plaguing people (me not included), I'm left in utter disbelief on what this game was and what it could have been on PC.\n\nThe biggest issue with the game is Online Multiplayer still remains non-existent. It's estimated to be released around Summer time "for free", but going by the Developers track record, people can only hope. This still remains the largest problem because this is a PC game/port in the year 2015. The devs took out the online portion on release because it was too "buggy" to work on steam. Also for some odd reason the PR department believes putting emphasis on something that should have been originally included will be added as a "free update." The "free update" should have been the Kurisu DLC as a sign of goodwill towards towards the people who purchased the game and are dealing with all the delays.\n\nThe game is currently on local play only and because this game is on PC, you're more than likely to be playing by yourself for the majority of the time. With only 8 stages and 4 difficulty levels with the 5th one being impossible unless you have the level 99 DLC and/or friends to play with, the game lacks the replay-ability to even remain relevant. Even then, the hardest difficulty is pointless for anything other than points becuase you can't even gain experience from it. If you want the evidence, take a look at https://steamdb.info/app/329490/graphs/ and see for yourself how well this game is currently doing.\n\nBecause the game completely lacks any kind of online interaction, this severely limits the game's life span and community from even growing into anything. Just go to steamcharts and look at this game. Then go look at similar games that have online play (For example, Castle Crashers).\n\nI hit the level cap at the start of Nightmare difficulty (This was from starting at level 1 on Hard because I unlocked Nagi). They finally did add achievements with patch 1.04, but it was implemented way too late. Take a look at the global achievement progress and have a look at how many people actually have the first achievement http://steamcommunity.com/stats/329490/achievements/\n\nA very important issue that many people do not realize, the content, pricing, and age of the game. This game was originally released on Xbox 360 on Feb 27, 2013 at $10 and later re-released on PS Vita for $12 on Mar 13, 2014 (JP) or Aug 12, 2014 (US). Now the pricing isn't very high, but the fact that the game price went up over time and was released on PC at $12 also is really weird. I asked one of the developers about why the price went up and instead received a round-about answer avoiding an actual answer.\n\nI also asked if they could make the Kurisu DLC free to at least regain lost faith and attract people to buying the PC version. I was then answered with, "It would be unfair to previous Mages customers who have bought previous versions of the game." I can see how that is a thing, but when your game is now 2 years old it doesn't do you any good to keep your prices the same. Re-releases do exist with more content in the form of GOTY editions and updated versions (Dynasty Warriors # __, Tales of __R, ____ GOTY Edition, etc.) with cheaper pricing and DLC included for free.\n\n*Another thing I have pointed out (somewhere in the forums) was that the developers are working on the PS4 version of the game and that the online mode will be finished around the same time that version is released. I stand by my random call because one of the PR members did say most of development team is working on that version of the game. So we don't know whether or not this game becomes obsolete after PB:BG Overdrive comes out.\n\nI would also like to point out that the game that was released on Steam was essentially an "Early Access" game. It was released completely bare bones with zero online features and as an experiment to see how consumers would react to it. And now slowly over time, the devs are slowly releasing slightly more content that is still not equal to the original versions of the game.\n\nAll in all, I could only recommend the game if it has fulfilled any of the things I have mentioned above at the start. But in it's current state, don't even bother touching this game until it receives the care that it deserves. If you have a PS4 just wait a couple months for the better version or hold off on this one and come back to it after summer to see what happens to it in the future.\n\nA message to the developers of Phantom Breaker Battle Grounds:\n\nThis game is a giant disappointment and your poor decisions have clearly held the game back from what it should have been on PC. You have released just another game on steam brushed aside into the trash, so GG. This thumb will flip when you can prove that this game is on equal footing with your new poster child Phantom Breaker: Battle Grounds Overdirve.","January 29, 2015","false","13.8"," 358 of 466 people (77%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","77","358","466","12","22"

You'd probably have to be familiar with Phantom Breakers to get what the characters are grudging over, but none of that gets in the way.\n\nEnemies are amusing, and often they heavily reference enemy types from Streets of Rage and sometimes even TMNT in some very humorous ways and the art may be taking some visual cues from the Scott Pilgrim beat-em-up (and that's a great thing). That in my opinion is the best part of this game, is all the references that are packed in, the care put into the backgrounds and how it all just comes together with really fun and slick controls. If you're a fan of these things, from Akiba culture to beat-em-up references, you'll love the subtle treats they have in store for you.\n\nIf you have the controllers, this game is well worth it whether it's to play co-op TMNT style or to play it solo. There's 5 difficulty modes, characters to level up and plenty of challenge in this package. And even if you just wanted to show 5pb. there's a place for them or Steins;Gate on Steam, you can't go wrong.","January 23, 2015","true","3.9"," 122 of 161 people (76%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","76","122","161","8","4"

However this game is a 2 laned beat em up, not a free moving one; so if you have ever played Guardian Heroes then the gameplay is basically like that. Its really cool and well done, and with some friends included, this game can take up a lot of your time. You start out with 4 characters, and you unlock more as you go (I believe 4 more). They are all female except one dude who you unlock all the way at the end, so if you do not like playing as female characters (you sexist ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s) then this game is not for you.\n\nI am very disappointed that the developers did not decide to implement the online feature such as in the console version (360). So yes, WARNING! THIS IS A LOCAL ONLY GAME. This still does not bring down the game, and I really do hope with the inclusion of the dlc at one point, developers will include online support.\n\nTLDR: Is this game worth a buy? Depends, do you like Castle Crashers? Double Dragon? Final Fight? Anime School Girls with weapons? Then yes.","January 23, 2015","true","2.9"," 91 of 122 people (75%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","75","91","122","19","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/329490/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","Phantom Breaker: Battle Grounds is a beat 'em up game which was originally released on Xbox Live Arcade, and PlayStation Vita, before later ported to the PC in early 2015.\n\nThe gameplay is side scrolling beat 'em up, with a surprising amount of combos, special attacks and techniques to use. The combo system is very easily mastered and you will be hitting high combos very early into your experience with this game. You gain experience after each level, which allows you to spend points in Attack, Defense, or Speed. You can also spend the same experience points in learning new attacks/moves to perform. It was hard to find a right balance between what to spend points on improving, so I just went down the route of improving stats along with improving basic attacks.\n\nThe graphic and art style in Phantom Breaker looks really nice. It has a very cute look to all of the characters, even the bad guys. If you can put up with the again underage looking characters, which are thankfully quite covered up compared to most anime games of this type, then the look of this game has a very nice appeal to it.\n\nThe sound effects were sadly something I wasn't a fan of, the over used moaning noises of the girls grows very tiresome after a while, it would of been nice to see a little originality. Phantom Breaker has a number of different difficulties to play, I wouldn't recommend playing on Easy mode (which I did) as it really is easy. There is no challenge to be had, I suspect the normal and harder modes really make you learn the bigger combos to get buy. I didn't actually die once during my playthrough on easy mode, which just shows how easy it was.\n\nEach of the seven levels are very well designed. Yes it is all just a side scrolling platformer, but the backgrounds/scenery in each stage look awesome. There are also various different items to destroy such as trash cans or crates in order to find health points and experience points.\n\nMy first playthrough (on easy) took me just under two hours. I can really see this being a game which has good replay ability thanks to the extra difficulty levels, as well as the co-op modes which actually supports up to 4 players.  There have been reports that the online multiplayer does not work very well, but I have not had any first hand experience with that.\n\nThis is actually a bad PC port; I couldn't even use my keyboard to play this game. You need a controller to be able to play; even though these types are games are best of being played with a controller, it would be nice to see basic keyboard functionality in a PC game.\n\nIn conclusion, I would recommend Phantom Breaker: Battle Grounds as it is a nicely put together side scrolling beat 'em up game. The price tag of £8,99 may be a little bit steep for some, but with the addition of local co-op, really makes this game a must have for people wanting some couch co-op action.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Only recommended when on sale\n3) Recommended\n4) Highly recommended\n5) This is a must play\n\nf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

Division 2 and published by 5pb. in 2013. it is a spin-off of the fighting game Phantom Breaker.\n\nChibi Retro Anime Girls Fighting Game. Do I need to say more. This game is great. The story is anime-ish and cool. The fighting system is interesting and there is cool skills that you can perform. The music could be a bit better. The game difficulty is system is great. Then you are replaying the game in harder difficulty, the game doesn't look boring. Also the good thing is that playing with different character the chat between the characters isn't the same, so you don't just skip the text (the story is the same with all the characters). Playing with different characters you see that they not only have unique skills, but also different personalities and this make the game more interesting. The coolest thing for me is that this game has a dlc pack with Makise Kurisu. She is from Steins;Gate.\n\nSteins;Gate (シュタインズ・ゲート, Shutainzu Gēto) is a Japanese visual novel developed by 5pb and Nitroplus. The story of Steins;Gate takes place in Akihabara and is about a group of friends who have customized their microwave into a device that can send text messages to the past. As they perform different experiments, an organization named SERN, who have been doing their own research on time travel, tracks them down and now the characters have to find a way to avoid being captured by them.\n\nThe bad thing is that, if you don't have the dlc, you can't get all the achievements.","July 5, 2015","true","9.2"," 17 of 29 people (59%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","59","17","29","3","0"

Participants wear a special set of armour during this tournament which bestows supernatural powers upon them but also (plot twist!) distorts the fabric of space and time when struck in battle, eventually allowing Phantom to access the shadow world and unlock his true power. Phantom Breaker: Battlegrounds is set in this alternative universe, where the four main protagonists work together to stop Phantom, restore balance and save Waka's kidnapped younger sister, Nagi.\n\nNonsensical, isn't it? It's not terrible as far as sidescrolling beat 'em ups go, but don't buy the game for its storytelling. You'll only be disappointed as the game features Japanese voice acting only and the conversations between characters, despite the helpful subtitles, don't explain too much.\n\nInstead, why not buy Phantom Breaker for the seamless combat borrowed from its fighting game predeccesor that relies on mastering combos, parrying and countering attacks? Why not buy it for the character selection? There are four ladies to choose from by default, an extra six to unlock once you've completed normal and hard modes, plus one who is DLC only. Each of these characters has a distinct style of battling, for example:\n\nMikoto: A greatsword-wielding elegant gothic lolita. Excels equally in both defense and attack. A jack-of-all-trades. Must have ties to the circus because she lives to juggle.\n\nWaka: Well.. endowed. Carries a naginata, focuses on mid range combat and keeping enemies out of melee distance or out of the air.\n\nItsuki: If brute force had a name it would be Itsuki. A maid with a hammer who crushes everything in her path. Slower than some of the other characters, but undeniably strong. An all out attacker.\n\nYuzuha: A schoolgirl brandishing a ninja blade and kunai. Extremely high-speed, uses simple combos, but you will probably be throwing ninja stars repeatedly because that attack is broken.\n\nAnd the DLC character Kurisu of Steins;Gate fame is more of a long range, technical gadget user. The rest of the cast is almost as diverse, but some of them are literally reskins of other characters.\n\nPhantom Breaker: Battlegrounds is worth the purchase for the addictive gameplay, guaranteed replayability (which is sure to increase when/if online multiplayer is added) and magical girl aesthetic. Buy it for the assortment of bizarre but brilliantly designed enemies, including but not limited to robots with cattleprods, monsters spawned from one of the bosses favourite MMOs, zombified caricatures of Japanese stereotypes, suplexing cyclops, fire-breathing dragons and hordes of floating elemental witches.\n\nBuy Phantom Breaker for the crisp, colourful art style and the subtle fun it pokes at other games and franchises in the stage backgrounds. Buy it for the catchy chiptune soundtrack; the multiple difficulties (easy, normal, hard, nightmare, nightmare+); the grind to level 99 (with DLC) if that's your thing and the utter insanity that ensues when there's more than just a single heroine on the screen. Buy it to encourage Japanese developers to release more of these games worldwide. Buy it for the waifu.\n\nIt is not completely unjustified to criticise the game because the developers haven't yet finished the multiplayer and I won't fault anyone who is upset about it, but disregarding Phantom Breaker's plentiful positive qualities as a result does seem unfair because it is still a wonderful, skill-based brawler, port or not, that boasts nonstop action locally and alone. If that tickles your fancy, you won't regret the purchase. I know I don't.","February 12","true","15.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

Despite the lack of online and remappable keys, Phantom Breaker Battle Grounds kept me entertained all the way through. The battle mechanic was surprisingly deep and it wasn't to the point where I wasn't overwhlemed with its techniques. Although it's a beat em' up, the gameplay is more like that of a fighting game (considering how this is a spin off of a fighting game) with oh so satisfying combos. The leveling system is like that of Castle Crashers where you'll add points to specific stats or your skill tree. The vibrant colors and soundtrack really draw you in the minute you start the game. This game is kind of like Scott Pilgrim in that you'll have trouble in the beggining of the game, but later on you'll be super buffed and the diffucult is basically nonexistant. The diffuculty really sets in during bosses, where most of the time you'll have to resort to spamming. The lack of multiplayer is a big downgrade from the console versions; but by myself, I was highly entertained. I HIGHLY reccomend that you play this game with a controller.\n\nTechnical issues with this game include: No online co-op, No remappable keys, bugs (although I havn't had any for myself), and the lack of dlc from the console versions (where is Kurisu?). Overall, this is a TERRIBLE port. Simple as that. HOWEVER, the creators have gone and addressed these issues and are trying to patch these problems in the future. As for the online portion, the creators are hesitant to add this feature in due to the feedback from the pc port. Hopefully they go through with it.\n\nPROS:\n+Addictive fighting mechanic w/ deep leveling system\n+Bright colors and catchy tunes\n+Secrets and plethora of chracters add replayablilty\n\nCONS:\n-No online\n-Unmappable keys\n-SHORT (I clocked in at 2.5 hours)\n-This game can be unfailry diffulcult at times (especially bosses)\n\nFinal Verdict: 5/10\n*If this game gets EVERYTHING IMPORTANT patched then the score will change to a 8/10\n","February 2, 2015","true","10.8"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","9","14","2","0"

Also, when going through the DLC Story mode, I found that it was terribly unfinished. Not to mention, when going through the game, I first started playing on easy mode to level up characters a bit before tackling the harder difficulties, couldn't get past the first boss with the DLC character... ON EASY... The boss was always countering, something I didn't know how to do due to the CONTROLS, and it would often end up stunlocking me, like some of the other enemies in the game. There are some good points about this game, but for me, since I don't have an XBOX PC controller, the cons outweigh the pros...

Are you familiar with Phantom Breaker? It was a fighting game for the Xbox 360 that was never released in the West. Oh, I thought not. But you've heard of Phantom Breaker: Battlegrounds. You know about the beatemup spinoff that was released on the Xbox 360, Playstation Vita, Steam, and soon the PS4? Eventually the original Phantom Breaker is going to appear on Steam or somewhere, and everyone will think "they made a fighting game spin-off?!?!?"\n\nBut that's all irrelevent, Battlegrounds is actually a spiritual sequel to Panzer Bandit, an obscure PS1 import. It's a multi-plane beatemup, the type where you can switch between the foreground and background at will. This is a very Japanese title, with stages taking place in Akihabara, enemies that include otaku and ganguro, and a heaping helping of shrine maidens, maids, ninjas, robots, and sword-wielding warriors of justice. This is all tied together with an 8-bit soundtrack and Saturn era graphics. It's absolutely nuts, and extremely well-done.\n\nMost beatemups keep things generally "fair". As far as moves and abilities go, you're only slightly more awesome than the 100s of thugs you beat up. The challenge is in out-maneuvering and out-punching everyone. In PB:BG you're waaaaaay more awesome than the goons you're brawling. Sure their numbers are far superior, but that just makes it more satisfying when you perform crazy special attacks and 200+ hit combos. Toss in the ability to level-up stats and skills, and nothing will stop you from looking your best. You can just keep spamming those crazy moves, and as long as you're playing semi-smart and remembering to heal yourself with the various full-course meals (found in trashcans), you'll be golden...mostly.\n\nBoss-fights are where things can become "unfair". Almost every boss is actually a playable character, just locked away until you complete the game on a couple difficulties. They're as awesome as you are, and will spam all of their favorite moves. I wouldn't say the difficulty does a 180, maybe a 150 or a 160, but it's still something that will lead to most of your game overs. Succeeding here relies on a different strategy, playing defensively. The cast of this game can guard, dodge, guard-cancel, "burst" to get out of danger (at the cost of health), and so on. Using these techniques is essential for the boss-fights as well as higher difficulties. Or you could just grind your stats up, that's fine too.\n\nWhile not as long as your favorite AAA franchise, PB:BG takes awhile to beat. I'd say that it's actually too long, especially considering it's designed to be an arcade beatemup. While the game does save between stages, the aptly-named arcade mode expects the player to go through the whole thing. I don't think it works in that context. With every level there are at least 1 or 2 sections that I would shave off, to give the game a more appropriate length. The story mode would retain its original time to complete (1:30 to 2 hours) while the arcade mode should take 45 minutes or even a little less. The lack of online-play is always unfortunate, and I'm worried that the changes/extras in the imminent PS4 version won't make their way to this release. Otherwise, I have no other complaints worthy of mention.\n\nWhat makes PB:BG such a joy to play is its options. The number of moves and abilities available to the player can be considered overkill, but they're easy to execute, and even more fun to combine. You don't need air-throws, EX special-attacks, super-moves, and the ability to guard-cancel out of a dash just to deal with a man that can barely swing his golf club....But what the hell, let's throw all that in there and go crazy. It reminds me of another obscure beatemup called Denjin Makai 2. Most of the enemies you fought in that game were losers, but you had the move-set of a grandmaster shaolin wizard cyborg. It was a hilariously one-sided match-up, but it was so much fun pulling off wicked combos that you simply didn't care.\n\nAll in all, Battle Grounds is a great entry in the genre.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","June 7, 2015","true","8.5"," 16 of 29 people (55%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","55","16","29","4","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dragnix/recommended/329490/","Dragnix","{FITH}™Dragnix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dragnix/","743 products in account","Summary:\nPhantom Breaker: Battle Grounds offers something unique in the idea that the beat em up has fighting mechanics, specifically with timed parries and more complicated counter/energy use mechanics. This creates a beat em up experience that does something surprising: being accessable for those who want to button mash, but adding a whole level of complexity to those who wants something a bit more technical. While the chaos on the screen can get in the way at times and the game certainly doesn't teach the above mechanics well at all, it's a solid overall experience that you can pick up on cheap (at the time of writing this review, it's part of the humble bundle weekly), and is a good local co-op experience as you bash a variety of enemies over and over again.\n\nGameplay Footage and Video Review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HBOKA_uknU\n\nLists:\n\n+:\nAccessible gameplay for button mashers to technical wizards alike, pleasing everyone in the process.\nCombat system for beat em up is surprisingly deep and works especially with counters and situational awareness.\nDual Lane system adds some variety to the game especially with enemies that throw bombs at you, causing you to relook at tactics.\nSoundtrack is reasonable and doesn't make you want to turn it off, and fits the level that it's usually playing with.\nAlright enemy variety, but nice to see cannon fodder get mixed up at times too.\nEven though the aesthetic can be all over the place, it all somehow fits together in the world. Scott Pilgrim like in a way.\n-:\nLacks teaching mechanics to teach the player some high level skills, only leaving it for a menu that they would only see if they were looking.\nDual lane combat can be problematic with big enemies in the foreground, who take up the screen and not let you see what's going on.\nMenus don't update to show what controller button your using, which is a shame.","September 14, 2015","true","4.2"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","58","7","12","3","0"

The main flaw is that the designers really didn't know how to add 'challenge' to the game so they tried to band-aid it in. Bosses jump in difficulty way too fast and fighting them becomes a battle of attrition.\n\nOriginally posted by "Blackbird@Degica  developer 23 Mar @ 7:56pm: There is a bit of a difficulty spike at the bosses. It's helpful if you save up special gauge, the Phantom Breaker attack does a ton of damage if you can hit with it. Leveling up your skills makes a big difference too, so make sure to assign all your skill points too if you haven't already"\nMost mooks are just a speed-bump and while that is true of most beat 'em ups, here they just palette swapped a few mooks and made them hit harder and have more HP and bam "challenge".\n\nStun-lock is an issue, you press nothing to block (why can't it be mapped to a button?!) and many enemies push you back when you block so you can never close the distance on ranged enemies in an effective manner.\n\nBoss fights are a joke with your health bar being the punchline, grinding to level up is akin to pulling teeth out armed only with string only for you to realize that you actually are holding a can of silly string and those teeth are actually a giant boulder.\n\nOverall though fighting the mooks to level up is boring and the boss fights don't feel like they are presenting a fair challenge, they just feel like 'you must be this level to pass, unless you can cheese us' and then you realize that the reason the game is designed like this is because it is so shallow. Their is nothing interesting or dynamic to keep you invested in the game, stage 1 is the same as stage 3 which is the same as stage 5, just mash mash mash away until you fall asleep.\n\nBuy Double Dragon Neon instead, both games are the same price but Double Dragon somehow managed to add FUN to the formula.\n\nJoin Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needs\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews","May 27, 2015","false","4.1"," 20 of 38 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","20","38","0","2"

Otherwise you'd probably hate yourself for paying full price and not getting those oh so important missing features in the cons list. It's a nice little time waster if you just want to take a break and mindlessly slaughter dudes in suits, gyaru girls or floating demon girls that shoot lightning. I'll probably max the characters and never pick this up again, but hey, maybe my interest will not fade so easily. Only time will tell.\n\nPersonal note: I would hope this game eventually updates and gives netplay, but I'm not holding my breath.","April 1, 2015","true","17.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I do recommend this game to Gamers that enjoy old style games like this one its one of the best out there for pretty much anyone to play.","September 24, 2015","true","4.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The fighting is very solid and works perfectly as far as I can tell. This game however is not without flaws. One major gripe I have with the game is that it gives you very little instruction on how to play the game. There are only general combo information in the help menu and no character specfic combo lists. The game doesn't teach you how to play it so you're mostly stuck button mashing until you discover the combos yourself. There are no resolution options or rebindable keys. I would reccomend this game only, and only if you have a controller. It's almost impossibel to play without one since the game doesn't tell you what the keyboard controls are. And even if you figure out what the keys are you can't rebind them.","November 30, 2015","true","12.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

That is why I was quite surprised when this one was actually really good. I've been suggesting this game to pretty much anyone who will listen for the past week. It's kinda like a mix between Scott Pilgrim beat-em-up and anime fighting game. You can get by with just button-mashing most of the time but you can also use a number of special attacks that is different for every character and adds alot of variety.\n\nThe main story will take about 3 hours but it has tons of replay-ability with the multiple characters and unlocked hard modes. It also has arcade and some other game modes if you're interested in any of that. Multiplayer isn't live on steam right now but I hear they're working on trying to get it up and running. This game is definitely worth a pick up whenever it's on sale so go grab it!\n\nP-Face gives this game a 4/5. Reason why it didn't get a full 5 is due to the fact there really isn't anything to the game other than the gameplay and a short story. It can get repetitive fairly quickly and it doesn't have secrets or anything else to add like other kinds of beat-em-ups do.","May 29, 2015","true","9.9"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","4"

Writing this makes me sad cause I love this game but some things just need to be said.\n\n~Gameplay is fun and entertaining. Its quite an addicting game.~\n\nThat being said, I bought this game when the tags for multiplayer, co-op, and online co-op still were on it in the store. Since my purchase the online co-op tag was removed but not the others.\n\nThe biggest thing I have to say that is a turn off is that this Xbox game port doesn't have ONLINE Co-op. It was completely stripped from the game. That being said, there are tags still present that make buyers think that there is. The video for online co-op is even in the videos, as well.\n\nThat being said, BUYER BEWARE. Great game, but the plans for ONLINE Co-op to be readded back to the game are on hold with no ETA because they are focusing on the PS4 port over the PC one (this port came first). By the time they finally decide to do it, it will probably be too late for there to be anyone still playing it. Yes, there is a forum thread full of people being displeased and I don't blame them. Most of us bought this game on PC because we spent hours on it on Xbox (I myself havew 400+ hours logged on Xbox).\n\nIn addition to all that, Local co-op is bugged and unplayable and most users have experienced issues where the game will not even allow them to do anything, including boot up the game.\n\nAgain, great game but Buyer beware cause you will be spending time playing this great party game alone. This factor alone makes me regret recommending it to my friends and buying it for some of them.","August 27, 2015","false","1.9"," 18 of 36 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","18","36","0","0"

So why am I not recommending this game?\n\nHere is the answer:\n- Been trying to do several runs in story mode now but the game automatically shuts down after the transfer between new areas (each shutdown differs between areas) so I've not even gotten the chance to complete Akihabara, the first stage. The fact that this is possible to happen when it's sold for real money is really bad. I can play the arcade mode just fine though.\n- It has one of the worst "controller friendly" settings I've seen.

That is why I was quite surprised when this one was actually really good. I've been suggesting this game to pretty much anyone who will listen for the past week. It's kinda like a mix between Scott Pilgrim beat-em-up and anime fighting game. You can get by with just button-mashing most of the time but you can also use a number of special attacks that is different for every character and adds alot of variety.\n\nThe main story will take about 3 hours but it has tons of replay-ability with the multiple characters and unlocked hard modes. It also has arcade and some other game modes if you're interested in any of that. Multiplayer isn't live on steam right now but I hear they're working on trying to get it up and running. This game is definitely worth a pick up whenever it's on sale so go grab it!\n\nP-Face gives this game a 4/5. Reason why it didn't get a full 5 is due to the fact there really isn't anything to the game other than the gameplay and a short story. It can get repetitive fairly quickly and it doesn't have secrets or anything else to add like other kinds of beat-em-ups do.","May 29, 2015","true","9.9"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","4"

Writing this makes me sad cause I love this game but some things just need to be said.\n\n~Gameplay is fun and entertaining. Its quite an addicting game.~\n\nThat being said, I bought this game when the tags for multiplayer, co-op, and online co-op still were on it in the store. Since my purchase the online co-op tag was removed but not the others.\n\nThe biggest thing I have to say that is a turn off is that this Xbox game port doesn't have ONLINE Co-op. It was completely stripped from the game. That being said, there are tags still present that make buyers think that there is. The video for online co-op is even in the videos, as well.\n\nThat being said, BUYER BEWARE. Great game, but the plans for ONLINE Co-op to be readded back to the game are on hold with no ETA because they are focusing on the PS4 port over the PC one (this port came first). By the time they finally decide to do it, it will probably be too late for there to be anyone still playing it. Yes, there is a forum thread full of people being displeased and I don't blame them. Most of us bought this game on PC because we spent hours on it on Xbox (I myself havew 400+ hours logged on Xbox).\n\nIn addition to all that, Local co-op is bugged and unplayable and most users have experienced issues where the game will not even allow them to do anything, including boot up the game.\n\nAgain, great game but Buyer beware cause you will be spending time playing this great party game alone. This factor alone makes me regret recommending it to my friends and buying it for some of them.","August 27, 2015","false","1.9"," 18 of 36 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","18","36","0","0"

The fact that this is possible to happen when it's sold for real money is really bad. I can play the arcade mode just fine though.\n- It has one of the worst "controller friendly" settings I've seen.

Many people bought this game in the hopes they could co-op with their friends and they can, so long as they are in the same room together. The only other issue with this game other then it missing that and the DLC is that there are no settings for PC, something I can look past, however the game does not want to remember that I told it to play in full screen instead of windowed mode. It doesnt seem to want to remember any of the game's settings, like volume, etc. If they fixed these things a more accurate and probably more positive review would be on the table, however even the unstable form of multiplayer on my xbox 360 was better then no multiplayer at all, especally if you try getting into the harder difficulties, where you need 3-4 people all at max level of 99, which you can't even get because this is an older patch of the Xbox and Playstation games so you are capped at level 50","January 28, 2015","false","0.3"," 11 of 23 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","11","23","0","0"

Movesets feel nice and the spritework looks pretty good with excellent animation. Unfortunately enemies are essentially punching-bags due to all too low aggression levels and dumb behavior, so constant juggling and relentless aggression worked well enough to land me a 1 Credit Clear on first try through story mode. Worse than being easy, fighting gets repetitive fast and Battle Grounds has overstayed it's welcome by the second or third stage because other than the enemy sprites and backgrounds, nothing important changes.\n\nWhat's more, Battle Grounds has leveling up between stages similar to Guardian Heroes, including a skill tree which unlocks new attacks and abilities. While this seems like it would lend more depth to the game, I never had to deviate from my usual pattern. The most meaningful attacks can be unlocked early on, and enemies are just not aggressive enough to make the various defensive abilities necessary. The absolute worst and most criminal feature of this system is that levels gained by characters are constant between sessions. So let's say you Game Over or quit and restart from the first stage, the characters you've previously used will be stronger than previous session and the game permanently easier unless you DELIBERATELY opt to rearrange your character to not use all of their skillpoints. Still, this means if you somehow cannot finish the game by learning it, you can through enough attempts accumulate enough strength and health to reach the ending anyway.\n\nHonestly, it's not exactly bad. Battle Grounds is just boringly mediocre. It has some very attractive qualities in how pulling off moves and beating enemies up feels, and the sprites and even some of the environments are very pleasing to look at. Music is good too. But it's so damn repetitive and boringly easy, put to shame by numerous belt-scrolling beat'em ups of the past.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/recommended/329490/","somebody336","somebody336","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/","2760 products in account","Phantom Breaker Battle Grounds is a 2D beat em up starring 4 girls trying to rescue someone called Nagi. The story is told upfront in the first mission but it is very forgettable and the characters are not introduced at all. I still have no idea who anyone is or why they have the powers that they do. Not that it really matters in a beat em up but it would still be nice to know these things if you are trying to tell a story. All 4 of the characters are fully voice acted which is nice but the only language available is Japanese. They usually only talk at the start of a boss fight in story mode and it is only groans and grunts during gameplay.\n\nThere are four modes in this game. The local multiplayer modes are called Battle Grounds which is a simple mode where you fight your friend and Coop Mode with up to three other players which has you going through the story missions. The solo modes are called Story which has you going through all the missions with dialogue and Arcade which is an absolutely useless mode since this game doesn't have leaderboards and the only difference is the lack of dialogue. When enemies die they drop both coins and red gems. Red gems are used to level up but the coins are useless which was a real missed opportunity for Arcade mode.\n\nLeveling up is done with “skill points” via the main menu or after missions. You can either upgrade your stats such as speed, strength and defends or you can also spend your points on new abilities like double jumping or magical attacks. It is a lot of fun upgrading your character and gives you a good reason to replay story mode over and over again. Characters are also customizable to an extent due to having multiple color pallets to choose from. Much to my surprise you do unlock more characters to play as later on and every character plays differently.\n\nWhich brings me to gameplay. That is the single best thing about this game and is much more in depth then most other beat em ups. There are ranged attacks, magical attacks, weak medium strong attacks, dash attacks and more. As well as double jumping, teleporting behind an enemy if you time the dash right and a emergency move that lets you escape a combo at the cost of all your mana. That's not even all there is to combat and it all comes together very nicely which is a welcome change to simple button mashing. Add to that how different the characters play from one another and you have something quite similar to a actual fighting game.\n\nYou can also jump into the background which allows for two planes to fight in. It is quite useful for moving out of the way of powerful attacks and to give you some breathing room when enemies start to corner you. It is very difficult to tell if a flying enemy is in the foreground or background. Along with that some of the larger enemies will block your ability to see your character while in the background which leads you to blindly fighting without knowing what is going on. Enemies are plentiful and range from humans, demons, robots and other oddities. Most do fight differently and are not simple clones so it is advised to learn their attacks patterns and behaviors early on.\n\nAt the end of each level is a boss fight and these are the moments when knowing how to fight in this game are most needed as they are no pushovers. Oddly enough the first real boss fight is one of the hardest in the game as you have no way to refill your health with food and you are very low level at that point. Starting off in this game is a bit of a challenge as there is no practice mode to learn how to fight and is further worsened by the fact that you start off with all moves available only to have them all taken away as you lose all your powers in the next level. There is a bare-bones tutorial to read in the pause screen if you find yourself at a loss.\n\nThe levels are all memorable and there are 8 overall starting from 0 to 7. This game has a very nice 16 bit artstyle and sound effects. It would be nice if we could play it in 1080p though. The graphic options are literally just a fullscreen on and off switch. As of a recent update the game now runs fine on monitors over 60hz. Online play which is available on consoles since day one  is still being worked on do to the developers focusing all their attention to porting to the PS4 which shows how much they care about the PC community.\n\nOkay, to be fair they are a small company and it is better to wait until it's not broken to release online play but the fact that the consoles have such a major feature makes this version look a lot less appealing. Moving on this game also features a very nice and upbeat soundtrack which has new tracks every level. It is a tongue in cheek game and never takes itself seriously which adds to the charm. There are obese enemies that throw cakes at you which are much more dangerous then they seem and some random non aggressive dude that shows up at times carrying a sack that you must beat up to progress.\n\nOverall this really is a great game that is unfortunately gimped for the PC users. Still there is no denying that Phantom Breaker Battle Grounds is definitely one of the funnest beat em ups I have played in a long time. The involving fighting system and the great leveling mechanic makes this a very addicting game even if there are only 8 stages. With a cap of level 50 and multiple unique characters, this has great replay value. This is not a game that should be dismissed due to it's anime artstyle. Highly recommended for fans of the genre and people looking for an action packed game.","June 2, 2015","true","7.3"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Before i start this review let me get one thing across to you readers. I have beaten the game on one character on one difficulty so far and am planning to 100% complete this game. Also remember this review is occuring the literal day after this game came out on steam. So with that in mind time to start the review.\n\nStory:\n\nHey guess what? If your someone who just beats a game and moves on this isn't for you. The story is 8 missions long, including the intro mission. Each one of the 4 starter characters have their own story mode but each on revolves around the same topic, so what really is the major change is what each character says and the other character they're speaking to's reaction. Because of this the game can take maybe an hour for seasoned people to beat it.\n\nGameplay:\nThe game recommends from the start that you play with a controller. I however do not own a pc or xbox 360 controller so i used the pc controls. I will not disclose the controls on the keyboard because in my opinion playing the game without having an idea of the controls is the best way to go. It makes you feel you really are getting more and more powerful the longer you go on and the more you learn. This game is level based. Your going to want to start the game on easy mode from the very beginning. I am clearing normal mode with my mian character who is over level 30 as we speak and i am struggling to get through individual stages...right now stage 6. You level up by collecting red gems which turn into exp at the end of the stage or when you die. Now if you have played it, you will notice several similarities with scott pilgrim versus the world the video game such as graphics.\n\nMusic:\nIt's retro. If you don't like retro music then your going to find yourself playing through the game with your sound muted. For those of you who love retro music, you will most likely enjoy the music.\n\nAlright since this review is the day after it came out, i'm going to do my best to sum up the story without giving away any real plot twists or spoilers.\n\nStory introduction:\nA man named phantom (phantom breaker ha ha ha. sarcastic laughter <-) kidnaps one of the main characters little sister nagi and its your job to get her back. You go through out the 1st stage with them giving you the maximum power your character can have. When you get to the end of the stage after beating the boss, the boss will steal your power sending you to level 0. However if you've been collecting the red games throughout the level, you most likely will be at least level 6-7.\n\nCharacters:\nSo far playing through this game i feel like each character both in fighting style and in their personality's are diffrent in their own way. Now there are a few people that are the anime characters you so often run into, but they are all enjoyable in my opinion.\n\nFinal battle:\n...this category is...strange...to say the least. You have found nagi and are escaping try to find the exit to where you are and the final boss is infinity, phantom's right hand man...although for the character i've played as, he has given very little information about himself and besides the intro to the game you've never really seen him until then. It sort of comes off as a random sudden boss battle that appears out of nowhere. That aside though, this is an extremely tough battle that will have you stressing yourself out. Remember that this is after clearing easy mode. I was over level 20 and i stressed myself out trying to beat this boss until the very end, in which case if i had taken 1 or 2 more hits then i would have lost.\n\n\nScore:\n8.5-9. It isn't for everyone but it is in fact a fun game for people like me. Go ahead and respond with your own reviews as you wish, but this game will always hold a soft spot in my heart for being one of the best fighting games i have played in the past few years.","January 24, 2015","true","14.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

You've got some beatemups like Scott PIlgrim, where it's clear more animators than actual beatemup designers worked on it.  But here, you get awesome fluid animations AND pretty deep, solid beatemup gameplay.\n\nGonna talk a bit about the mechanics, cause there aren't any good guides that I can find, and despite a 25 page "how to play" section in options, the game doesn't do a very good job of explaining itself.  Every character has special attacks as well as a main combo.  The combo can be started from the light, medium, or heavy stages of it using that button, but if you just mash light attack, you'll automatically start the combo from the beginning, progress through medium and heavy attacks, even if you just keep pressing light attack.\n\nEach character's special attacks vary widely, and they're handled with the fourth button coupled with directional inputs (down, toward, and toward-toward are the 3 you get).  You're going to want to focus on putting skill points toward "Special Attack" in your skill tree before anything else, as without those points you can't do special attacks, period.  The game is much harder and less fun without that skill.  EX versions of each special attack are done with Special + Heavy, and have anime-looking cut-ins and bigger damage and animations.  They take a full meter to do, and you need a point in the EX Attacks skill on your skill tree.  Again, you're going to want to focus on getting there ASAP instead of putting points into your stats.  Stats don't alter the game much; specials and EXes do.\n\nSame goes for Phantom Break and Overdrive, but you won't have those back for a while.  Something worth noting that the game doesn't explain: your meter charges up twice.  Phantom Break and Overdrive consume 2 meter, EX attacks and your "outrange" attack's strong version consume 1.  Blue gems recharge your meter, red gems are XP, coins are just for points.\n\nThere's some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t you'll run into later on, with the hovering homing-magic enemies that can endlessly chain you until you die.  I'll share with you the thing that took me forever to figure out and made the game fun again: Dodging from plane to plane can help you shake their magic, and if you hit them they have to be grounded for a while, and they can't use their homing magic from the ground.\n\nThere's more characters to unlock, 2 each for easy, normal and hard story mode clears.  You can actually play those characters in story mode in this version, it skips dialogue and you can level up between stages as normal.  You don't have to play the unlocked characters in arcade mode!\n\nSo, it's a fun, beautiful beatemup with good mechanics and lots of characters, good music, a nonsense story, and local co-op.  Get it right the hell now, and armed with what I've explained here, you'll be able to immediately have some fun.","February 12, 2015","true","8.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I would give this one a thumbs-up. Overall positive experience and I'm enjoying it. Breakdown below.\n\nPROS:It's a Scott Pilgrim meets anime type game with the front and back rail side-scrolling action. The retro feel was captured well, and the sprites are pretty adorable. It's great for a game to sit down for a few minutes between two games and hammer out some levels on a chibi anime character. Good retro music and cute voice overs sell the experience. Crazy boss battles prove difficult and add to the challenge.\n\nCONS:My only problem is that the DLC for Kurisu, an additional character playable in the game, was 5$USD. If an another level or two, or even an extra character were included in the DLC I would not be as put off on the price of the addon pack. This DLC pack does bring the all-around level cap to 99 so that you can further level some of your characters, but this is still a bit steep in my opinion without any extra content on the side. However, maybe the price doesn't bother you. I picked up the DLC in addition to the base game due to Summer Sale pricing (the Kurisu + Level 99 DLC was 4.19$USD). After sale all-in-one pricing may not appeal to you.","June 16, 2015","true","2.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Normal difficulty with a poor character build took me about 2-3 hours So it's fairly short definitely a sale kind of game to sink a few hours into something, You can Prolong it's lifespan by playing around with all the characters and beating all the difficulties.\n\nAll n All, I can see my time getting past 10 hours and for $2.99 I'd call that a fair exchange.","May 28, 2015","true","15.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

Here are some of its positive aspects:\n\nThe game looks and feels great - the visuals are nice and the controls are responsive.\nThe game has a pretty cool midi/chiptune (I'm not sure about the correct term) soundtrack.\nThe game offers a pretty enjoyable combat system - you have a variety of options during combat (i.e. you can attack, guard, execute guard break, etc. Mostly things that you'd expect to have in a fighting game)\nThe game offers 4 playable characters (5 if you've bought the Kurisu Makise DLC; After palying through the story mode I ended up unlocking a sixth playable character)\nNegatives\n\nI would like to mention the following negatives as they seem to be game breaking for some people...\n\nThere is no Online Multiplayer (as of the writing of this review)\nThe controls could prove to be problematic for some.\nThe controls:\n\nIf you have a 360 controller there should be no problems as the game provides detailed information about the controls and combos.\nHowever, if you intend to play the game with the keyboard, it's not going to be easy to figure out the controls (on your own at least). The game doesn't provide any information about the keyboard controls (logically, it doesn't allow rebinding of keys either...) and so, the player is left to figure them out on his/her own. Here is a breakdown of what I've figured out so far:\nMenu controls:\n\nW/A/S/D - Navigation.\nB - Confirm.\nJ - Cancel/Back.\n1 - Seems to act like a Start button. Whenever J doesn't work, 1 sends you back to the main menu; otherwise it acts as a confirm button.\n2 - On the specific occasion when both "J" and "1" don't send you back in the menu, pressing "2" will.\n\nCombat controls:\n\nW/A/S/D - Movement.\nG - Executes a full combo - starting with weak attacks and progressing through medium attacks to strong attacks.\nH - Starts the combo sequence from the medium attacks onward.\nJ - Executes strong attacks.\nH+J (pressed simultaneously) - Execute a special attack (This is a special attack shared by all playable characters).\nB - Guard.\nY - Switch lanes (combat is done in one of two lanes at a time; with "I" you switch between these lanes).\nEsc - Opens the menu.\n\nImportant note regarding the controls:\n\nIf you open the controls options menu the game will display a 360 controller, however if you press one of the aforementioned keys, the corresponding key will be pressed on the screen.\n\nConclusion\n\nOverall, I found the game to be fun and enjoyable. It would have been nice, however, to be able to play online with other people (both co-op and PvP).","July 16, 2015","true","6.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Desenova/recommended/329490/","Desenova","Desenova","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Desenova/","319 products in account","An unexpected joy with the nostalgic side scrolling 2D brawler genre or just another run of the mill disappointment? I'll say this much - Phantom Breaker: Battlegrounds sure is colorful and tugs at all the right strings.\n\n\nGameplay: 86/100 B+\n\nWhen people think of 2D side scrolling brawlers, a few names pop up, TMNT, Streets of Rage, The Simpsons, and countless others. Most are fairly similar with quirks here and there to differentiate themselves from others. On of those common features is the ability to roam between the foreground and background, but in Phantom Breaker: Battlegrounds, you are locked in either the former or latter and decide when to switch. This adds a bit more strategy than one would think as opponents are stuck with the same mechanic. This also adds another way to dodge attacks or create windows for an offensive. Then you have the combos, hit streaks, slides, and power moves to round things out. You also have several characters to choose from with their own abilities which you can tailor to your needs in a skill tree style setup. Another simple mechanic adding another level of complexity to the tried and true formula. You also have two meters: A life bar and a power bar, which can be filled twice. Each level releasing a different kind of power attack.\n\n\nAudio: 80/100 B-\n\nThe sounds department is decent enough. The music is appropriate for the game and levels and at times very catchy. It has that old school arcade sound in everything, high pitched pings, retro digitized voices, and electric blasts, yet not done in a bad or emulated way. I have to give the sound department some props for making it sound as if the game was made at the height of the arcade fever days without sounding old or a parody. In any case, I would be more than happy to add the soundtrack to my collection to listen to outside of the game.\n\n\nVisuals: 88/100 B+\n\nPhantomBreaker is colorful, that's a given, with its retro look, chibi characters, and scrolling backgrounds reminiscent of Super Street Fighter, it all melds well. And the enemies are all designed in a loving way and come in a good variety. The attacks shine and have their own distinct look with bright letters and numbers showcasing combos or hit streaks. At times, it can feel a bit overwhelming with everything popping up on the screen at once, but with games like this, you're never really meant to see or absorb everything that happens, hence why there are so many bad guys or special items that drop. The thing is that, the more I played, the more I wanted to see, what did the next area look like, what ridiculous enemies will appear, on and on and on. No matter what genre the game is, if you're able to pull that off, you've succeed on some level.\n\n\nStory: 80/100 B-\n\nThe story, like with most other games of the type, isn't exactly a strong point. From what I have gathered, this game continues on from a previous title and bits and pieces pop up here and there. Of course I could be totally wrong. It's almost childish in a way, but not bad or even demeaning. It's straightforward with the goals it sets for itself. Then again, I just wanted to skip the dialog and get to the next battle, so the fault could lie in me altogether.\n\n\nContent: 83/100 B-\n\nSurprisingly, there is a fair amount to do in Phantom Breaker outside of the main single player experience, with a Co-Op mode, and arena mode for playing with others online. The campaign was also pretty good in length, of course I'm not the best at fighting games at all, so it probably is shorter than what I think, but the game doesn't feel like it is trying to rush you to the next stage just to get the game over with. You can button mash your way or learn all the different combos - either way, there's a lot. On top of that, the moderate amount of customization with the skill trees for each character adds another layer of depth from the pre-determined stats.\n\n\nDesign: 81/100 B-\n\nSimplicity is key. There isn't really much to say because not much really needs to be explained. You have a life bar. You have a power up bar. You have items you can collect while fighting to refill each, your basic weak kick/punch, strong kick/punch buttons, combos that aren't overly elaborate to pull off, actually, they're really fun to do since they mostly require pushing two or more buttons at once. And the skill tree, as I've mentioned before, is straight to the point, allocating skill points into whatever you want. The main menu is also the bare basics, settings are simple as well. It grounds itself fairly well with the core gameplay, which in turn allows it to add the gimmicks or quirks without breaking the game in the process, something other games could learn from.\n\n\nMultiplayer: 85/100 B\n\nI didn't get to spend as much time with this as I wanted, but that which I was able to play was actually fun, with up to four players at the same time battling can be chaotic, but it isn't. I'm sure if other games tried it, it may not work as well, i.e. Mortal Kombat, but here, it ran just fine and kept the same pace as the campaign.\n\n\nPerformance: 87/100 B+\n\nPhantom Breaker ran fantastically on my PC. At first I thought I could play the game on my keyboard, but soon learned that it was a bad idea. So I dug around my box of controllers and found my stupid Mad Catz 360 controller. From there, the game worked wonderfully. No lag, no screen glitching and the transitions from foreground to background works really well. I just wish the screen would automatically go into full screen mode every time I started the game.\n\n\nVerdict: 84/100 B-\n\nBottom line: Phantom Breaker: Battlegrounds is a solid entry into the 2D brawler genre and while it isn't revolutionary, it holds its own, adding just enough flare, just enough icing and doodads to a trustworthy cake that makes it worth, not just to have, but to share as well.","February 7, 2015","true","0.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/329490/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Why developers still insist on locking away harder difficulty levels is beyond me. Here we have a novel 2D beat 'em up that oozes style through and through, but its flashiness is soon overshadowed when all the player does is near-mindlessly tap away at the same two or three buttons.\n\nWith Phantom Breaker: Battle Grounds, this is so frustrating because the mechanics are more intricate than they initially appear to be but players are expected to sit through lengthy monotonous play sessions in order to even discover this, let alone benefit from the varied play styles.\n\nOodles of beat ‘em ups out there are serviceable despite being straightforward romps from left to right but Phantom Breaker is not content with conformity. Given that the series actually has its roots in the realm of fighting games, the mechanics in this offering are refreshingly intricate when applied to a 2D beat 'em up instead. This means you’ve got a whole slew of attacks to work with, complex blocking, super meters and, most satisfying of all, the ability to chain together a lengthy series of combos that pack a serious punch on hordes of foes.\n\nIt's just a crying shame that all of this system’s potential has to be manually unlocked first. Obviously that statement is a subjective one and going to vary depending on your familiarity with the genre, but once I found a couple of moves with each character that could exploit the enemy AI, the experience became a mindless button masher on any difficulty below Nightmare. Many players will inevitably form their impression of the game during the hours-long story or arcade modes and because even "hard mode" requires minimal thought.\n\nEven some of the more overt design choices feel frivolous without the difficulty required to utilise them. Enemies occupy two different planes in a manner similar to platformers like Mutant Mudds, and you can switch between them at will, but the impatient AI means they’ll come to you and so there’s rarely a reason to switch outside of boss battles, which have patterns that do require you to switch back and forth. It’s more a liability than anything else as it means one more button to chase down the occasional foe that refuses to cooperate. Crank the challenge up a notch, though, and suddenly the extra space granted by having two dimensions to swap between is essential to weave around threats and limit the foes on your trail as much as humanly possible.\n\nThere’s also a JRPG-style character growth system that should, in theory, add a ton of value. Powering up your fighter is done in a manner reminiscent of Castle Crashers and you have to weigh the importance of agility, power, defense, and super moves depending on your play style. Or you could randomly pick any option on the easier difficulties and it would make the experience even tamer. It’s also possible to readdress how your stats are allocated after the fact and this sort of experimentation makes overcoming tough boss battles quite the engaging pastime. I wish more titles in the genre featured a similar system because it’s a neat way to help players win without outright handing them the victory.\n\nStrategy and skill be darned, though, the game will still grow dull before too long unless you’re absolute genre diehard. Most levels are massive, sprawling ones that simply overstay their welcome by offering little more than new faces to pummel in. The nature of the level-up system also means that, even on high difficulties, your enjoyment will probably decline before level 50. And given that level 40 can be achieved in a single playthrough of arcade mode, you’ll have to rely on multiple characters to get any long-term value from this one until the level cap increases.\n\nWhat kept me glued to the game, however, was the aesthetics. A good beat ‘em up ought to captivate the player in some manner beyond bashing faces in and Phantom Breaker excels at that. Buried within a vividly animated Scott Pilgrim-esque world are countless nods and winks to Japanese culture from cuisine to electronics to myths and legends. These all add a considerable degree of atmosphere to the proceedings. Throw in some infectiously catchy tunes and the repetition of it all will fade away for large chunks of a playthrough.\n\nPhantom Breaker: Battle Grounds isn’t going to convert anyone who sees beat ‘em ups as mindless entertainment. Yet even when its ideas are half-baked in execution, the overwhelming style and ambition here make for one of the genre’s more memorable entries in recent years. If you’re in the market for a decent beat ‘em up, you’ll have a tough time not to respecting 5pb’s effort to breathe life into the genre.","September 14, 2015","true","12.1"," 19 of 40 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","19","40","0","0"

I have been playing this game since the 360 version came out a few years ago, enjoyed the heck out of it, bought all the available DLC, completed it on all the difficulties and still wanted more.\n\nAt first glace it just seems like your typical Beat 'em Up but don't be decieved! This game combines RPG elements with combos you'd see from a fighter, you can choose what stats you'd like to have and skill set until you manage to max your character out, you also have a diverse number of moves, even special attacks you can chain into one another you can use to combo your enemies into oblivion. Whether you play this alone or with friends this game should keep you occupied for months to come.\nThe replay vaule, in my opinion, is moderate at best since you only have 7-8 stages to choose from and the difficulty is what really spices it up in between how many of the characters you care to play as.\nIf you get tired of beating up the A.I. in the game then there's a another game mode where you can fight eachother with any of the playble characters you have unlocked.\n\nThis game, even 2yrs after I originally played it still holds up well. It's severly underrated and I have no idea why. Maybe it's just not that popular or not many people know about it. If you're reluctant to give this game a try, I'd say wait until they decide to inpliment the online mode as this is where the game really shined for me.\nSo, just to recap:\n\nPros\n- Simple to complexity gameplay\n- Combines Beat 'em Up with RPG elements\n- Tons of moves to do\n- Handful of characters to play as (outside of story)\n- A good range of different difficulties\n\nCons\n- Only 7-8 stages\n- Currently no Online\n- A few minor bugs offline that need addressing (I've only run into one crash so far)\n- Subpar controller support/unable to remap keyboard keys(it doesn't even tell you what the keys are to my knowledge)\n- Slight framerate issue\n\nIf you're a fan of GH, SPvtW or CC then this should be right up your alley.","January 30, 2015","true","17.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The game is fairly cheap and proportionate to the amount of money paid since the game doesn't offer too much. The DLC is what really bothers me, it's 6 dollars, SIX DOLLARS why does it cost so much for a DLC? oh well I dont know it only consists of adding one character and the ability to level to 99 which I find quite stupid. The devs are charging you 6 dollars for something that should cost like 50 cents, hell the ability to level to 99 shouldn't even be paid for that's something mandatory to add into the gameplay. From what I have seen on the DLC the new character isnt that powerful and that's another reason why to question it's ridiculous price.\n\nThe DLC makes the game itself cost 18 dollars and no it's not optional if you want to enjoy the full experience because you know you are unable to gain 44 levels. Also why the hell would I pay 18 god damn dollars for a game that isnt even that vast, a six dollar dlc should consist of more than just 1 character and some new stages or something because, charging six dollars ( 18 whole) for a new part of a game that NEEDS to be there isnt very fair. There are many many many more games that cost less than this and offer much much more they are proportionate to their price unlike this.\nwould I recommend this to an average gamer? no. To a gamer that doesn't care about his/her money and just wants to waste it, yes. also the fact you cant 100% the game without the DLC is sad.\n\nIn the end I would ask to please please please change the damn price of the DLC to something more reasonable.","May 3, 2015","false","11.0"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

If you have a good spatial intelligence this will trip you up a lot because not only does it just look oh so wrong but more importantly the enemies won't land where you anticipated and then proceed to punch you in the back. Basically you'll have to try to forcefully shut off your spatial thinking which is neither easy nor pleasant.\nSpeaking of the z-plane, like SoR and unlike most fighers you can move on the z-plane but whereas in SoR you were able to do that freely here you only can jump between 2 fixed lanes.\nStill the fighting system is where Phantom Breaker can set itself apart from SoR, offering a fusion of fighting games and brawlers.\nIn conclusion these fighter elements are the biggest reason why this game might be worth a look for some people - as for me though I'd chose SoRR over this any day.","May 31, 2015","false","3.4"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","36","4","11","0","0"

Which leads me to the next problem.\n- You have to unlock all the skills, from double jumps to special skills to the Phantom Breaker, which is the highest skill you can achieve. You achieve skills by level up through collecting gems which will be dropped by enemies. This seems okay, but I'd like to have the option to try out all the moves of a char before I decide to put a few hours into maxing it out.\n- The balance is completely off for at least one character, which is the girl with the cat ears and the claw. She is too overpowered, since her forward special will take out almost any normal enemy. I have spammed my way like this through to the last stage without any problems on hardcore difficulty, while being able to collect most of the gems and points since this makes her go a decent distance, so already now she is a higher level than the other girl with the sword who I used to play through normal. Maybe I get more levels due to the difficulty, that's also a possibility. There is a bonus stage in the train where you can smash a lot of eggs for bonus points and EXP. Due to that specific move it was easy getting everything in there.\n- No rebindable controls, and an annoying way of prompting inputs. By that I mean, the game does clearly show an X-Box 360 Controller in the settings, but the buttons are not A,B,X,Y, but 1,2,3,4, and not even in the same order. This seems like a lazy thing to do, especially since you can't rebind keys. If you play with keyboard, good luck figuring out the keys. There's a "guide" on Steam which shows them.\n- Sometimes enemies will put you in a stunlock, since you're vulnerable the instant you recover from an attack. Maybe I just missed something, but I've had some trouble with that.\n- I think there's a story in there somewhere, but I'm not completely sure.\n- The story mode is rather short. If you're no completionist, playing through it once or twice will probably be enough for most players.\n\nBut there are also things I like:\n- The overall style of the game is neat, from graphics to sound. It all looks and sounds polished, the soundtrack is perfect for the game, the animations look smooth, and the chibi style is just too adorable! The characters each have their own unique look and abilities. Voice acting is standard anime quality; not bad, but not anything special either.\n- The enemies can be quite challenging when it comes to bosses on higher difficulties, but it's never unfair (except when said stunlock occurs).\n- It has a borderless fullscreen mode.\n- I can see some speedrun potential there.\n- Rule 34 may approve of this game.\n\nI have not tried out coop. I imagine that will also put some more fun into that.","January 24, 2015","true","6.9"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

And hey, i saw the video, i saw the pics, great graphics! the background look so good! the sprites are amazing! i am not even bothered by the whole anime-fan-girl-kawaii ♥♥♥♥.\n\nBut then i start playing and i realize...this game SUCKS.\n\nKurisu, a DLC character and one of the main reasons i bought the game, has crappy attacks and serve only as a way to play a harder game, but for gameplay reasons, not style.\n\nThe game itself sucks as a beat'em'up, the first stage ( stage 00) disorient the player since YOU START WITH EVERY POWER ( even though the story justifies they loosing their powers, this " god of war 2 tutorial stage" is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t), there are no pick-up itens and the lane-swtiching system could be cool, but it serves no purpose in this game.\n\nThe worst part? being a button masher. you can spam HEAVY ATTACKS ( which are fast) and rarely will have to strategize ANYTHING. You can finish the game in two hours, button-smashing you way through.\n\nThe music is bland, you won't remember nothing, every girls sounds exactly the same, a typical, standard kawaii anime girl. The story is uninteresting, forgetable and a lot of things don't make sense ( you fight 2 or even 3 alter-dimension selfs of your girl, and there is a discount Krieger from Archer who appears out of the blue).\n\nThe best part is that the sprites are really good, there is plenty of enemy types with not bad graphic variety, the background isn't reallt original, but also got a good level of care, they are well done and appealing, but then...that won't save the game, it plays like garbage.\n\nThe level system is only for padding, the only pleasure you get from this are blips-and-blops and pretty flashy indicators, it's like a pavlov gaming experience.\n\nI'll recommend only for one kind of situation: If you want to blindly play something just for giggles; AND only if you're a really into anime chicks stuff.\n\n","December 28, 2015","false","3.2"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

I could’ve remapped them but I grabbed an Xbox 360 controller and it recognized the controls perfectly without configuring. The responsiveness of the controller was spot on, I can’t really complain, I had no issues. There’s essentially two planes you fight on which I will call “front-stage” and “back-stage” for the sake of not knowing what to call them![/list]\n\nUltimately, I loved it. I’m a nut for anime so I thoroughly enjoyed the Japanese voice-over and chibi art style. The gameplay is fun and can be challenging at first.

I played the story mode once I wanted to do it again but I just couldn't. After that I searched for the multiplayer feature, to my surprise there was no Multiplayer for PC and don't try local splitscreen or whatever cause the binds take up like 80% of my keyboard. Anyway I totally would have spent more time on this game if there was an onlne feature but there sadly is not one yet. This game in its current state which is to be honest a decent state, aside from bad controls and no Online Multiplay gets a good 6/10 in my book But since I purchased this for like 1$ I feel a little better about how I manage money. This game would be 7/10 if there was Multiplay and it could even have been 8/10 if the story was somewhat improved.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AmethystViper/recommended/329490/","AmethystViper","AmethystViper","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AmethystViper/","88 products in account","Before fanboys get the wrong idea of this review, the reason why I'm not giving Phantom Breaker: Battle Grounds a recommendation on Steam is not because of the game itself, but rather how lazy this port is. The short version is that Phantom Breaker: Battle Grounds is a fun 2D brawler with a nice retro aesthetic and fighting game-styled mechanics reminiscent to that of Guardian Heroes, Panzer Bandit, and Mad Stalker: Full-Metal Force, although playing the game multiple times solo to level-up your characters might get monotonous after a while. The PC version of this game, however, is a lot to be desired.\n\nThe game is locked at 720p and the recent v1.05 patch botches the game's frame-rate on 60Hz displays. Apparently the developers tried fixing frame-rate issues for those with 120Hz or higher displays only to make things worse for those who have 60Hz displays, myself included. It doesn't end there, though. Rebindable keys? Online multi-player? Where's that? The game has idiotic set-up for keyboard that you can't change at all (and it doesn't tell you what the keys are in-game), and there are some very odd bugs on certain hardware set-ups. You could try using AutoHotkey for this, but as I experimented hacking the game's unbindable keys, the game causes some bizarre problems with my PC. I'm not sure if an issue with AutoHotkey or if that's this game of saying "Up yours and your rebindable keys!" Controller support is just as ♥♥♥♥-poor, as you can barely change the button layout and it seems that only Xbox 360 controllers (or a Logitech F310 and its variants in XInput mode) that work with this game; other non-Xbox 360 controllers appears to be bugged for some people. Not having actual keyboard or (relevant) controller prompts doesn't help. Online multi-player is axed the PC version, which is a thing for the console and PlayStation Vita versions, so if you're looking to play this game with your buddies when they're not under the same roof as yours: forget about it. The developers claimed these issues would be fixed by July, but it's already December as of writing and not a damn thing has been done to fix these issues, much less respond to consumer feedback. I would be bit a more understanding if there was some kind of non-disclosure agreement or something that is keeping the developers from speaking about Phantom Breaker: Battle Grounds on PC, but from what's going on here, it seems like the developers don't care about their customers.\n\nFalse promises, lazy ports, and treating your PC consumer base like second-rate customers shouldn't be acceptable anymore in this day and age. "Committed to support all versions of PBBG for a long time" my ♥♥♥. As it stands, don't even bother paying for this game on PC and its DLCs full price unless you're desperate. You're better off playing Phantom Breaker: Battle Grounds on the PlayStation 4 or Vita, Guardian Heroes on Xbox 360 (which is a good port that I hope it makes its way to PC one day), or Double Dragon Neon on your system of choice. If — and that's a very strong if — they actually listen and address these problems, which I'm doubting more by the mintue, maybe I'll consider changing my vote and this review, otherwise spend the $12-18 on something else, preferably not on BANZAI PECAN: The Last Disgrace of This Century.","October 1, 2015","false","6.5"," 16 of 39 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","16","39","0","2"

I was egstatic to play with my firneds who didn't buy it for Xbox 360. The game is amazing and fun, YET this portt is false advertisment as it has no online co-op that the develpoers said would be in it. Co-op was the main reason that the game was fun. It was never in the PC port to begin with and felt as if the port was stripped of everything fun. Since its release in January the Devlepoer have said that they will incorprate Co-op. After backlash they told customers that co-op would be available in summer 2015. It is October 2015 and still no co-op and the developers should be held for the false advertisment on the store page and no co-op when the game released. Spread the word and voice your opinons against the Developers.

Breaking your promises do not do you well.

The fault isn't due to the game itself (it was fine, and fun) but rather the developers for abandoning the game for most of 2015 (and now 2016 onward).\n\nIt has bugs. It needs fixes.

Phantom Breaker however is one of the worst out there.\nSure it has nice pixel art ( especially backgrounds but the characters art is a different story, also this game is a port from Xbox 360 ), that's about it... nice art.\n\nList of issues is big so bear with me.\n\n-it's advertised that it has multiplayer ( yes you can play co op on the same screen lol ) but I was dissapointed that it does not support online ( even KOF and heck Battle Block Theater has online )\n\n-no tutorials whatsoever ( there is some sort of How To "booklet" that you can read but it doesn't help. Unless you practise moves you won't learn them ( no practise mode either ). So we have very steep learning curve from the beginning.\n\n-Normal mode requires lots of grinding... ( to unlock special powers, move sets and really cool finishers ). I found myself dying TONS of time on second level with the boss... simply because I was underpowered.\n\n-Lack of emphasis on player skills ( this game seriously promotes spamming attacks and buttons ). Lots of things are happening on the screen at the same time and its hard to time things correctly because there is no way you will see enemy attack when you have like 5-6 of them stacked together + boss... Therefore counters and blocks are basically happening randomly.\n\n-AWFUL control scheme. First it takes time to get used to what H M L and SP means because game won't tell you YOUR key bindings. Add to that fact that block happens when you do nothing... who the heck thought it was a good idea? Annoying. Ok let's just say i can live with that... BUT SP button is frustrating! You want to do counter son? DO YOU? Well press SP just before enemy attack lands on ya easy right? WRONG!!!!\n\nBecause SP button has BUTT loads of other functions it can activate EMERGENCY MODE ( that drains your HP ! ) so if you are tad "too" late, then you won't do counter but rather activate Emergency Mode... and IT HAPPENS LOTS OF TIMES because you can't see **** with all that stuff on the screen. That is the most frustrating thing ever.\nCombos are ok but executing throws is bad and half of the time doesn't work ( imput lag maybe? seriously its simple -> plus H when near enemy and YET it's so fricking hard... )\n\n-story is just non existent to me ( i found myself pressing buttons all the time because all those "cutsey" voices are just sooo annoying )\n\n-characters are boring and cliche. ( I was playing as a ninja girl so I was hoping for some tough lines from her but instead she is "moe" whatever... i'm gonna puke. Ayame from Tenchu that's a ninja girl. Not this wishy washy psychopath that smiles with a cute voice ~uguu )\n-because its a port sprites are a bit enlarged and there is no resolution options....\n\nOverall go buy yourself King of Fighters or Skull Girls you will have better time as those games have better design, control scheme and are just way more fun to play than this frustrating candy covered piece of horse manure...","January 24, 2015","false","1.5"," 24 of 67 people (36%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","36","24","67","5","0"

It's a short game, but a lot of fun.\n\nUnfortunately, there is a rather significant problem with the PC port.  It won't save data, the controller (I used two different ones, had the same problem with both) isn't recognising when I hit the lane change button, it defaults to German every time I open the game.  There is a fix, if you look in the community hub for a thread about the controller not responding.  There's a config file you can download and have to rename, pop that into the config folder, wipe the files that are there already, and you're good to go.\n\nAs I was until a synch error wiped a) the config files and b) my save data.  A -bit- aggrivating, to say the least.  An easy fix once you know how to juggle the config files, but it really needs a good patch before I can take that asterisk off my recommendation.\n\ntl;dr: Fun game, but maybe wait for a patch or two before paying full price.","March 30, 2015","true","9.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Great music, great pixelart though some scaling inconsistencies harm it a bit (and the generic enemy design isn't as good as the main characters, which are great). I don't know the source material very well, but the player characters are all very cute and have cool attacks. Cocoa is best.\n\nIt's a good length and is fun to replay or play with friends (online co op coming in a free patch). Good variety of characters, though you'll have to level them up to get the best use out of them. Do note the port is fairly simple, and you'll really want a gamepad, but the game doesn't have too much in need of tweaking anyway.\n\nI also made a video showing the game with some more elaborated thoughts, showing of Cocoa's gameplay.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4Acpm35F_0","March 20, 2015","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a *not-very-well* port. I played on i5 | Nvidia 630m | 8 GB ram notebook and  it's very laggy for 2.5 d game. my friends own pc and they don't have any problem. with my notebook spec I still able to play bioshock infinite without any problem.\n\nYou know what, steam has refund policy now, if you purchased it and your gear doesn't match or for some reason you don't like it you could ask for refund -- and I think it's a good win-win. I think japanese publisher should learn to respect pc player.

I enjoy 2d side scrolled in general, but this takes the cake with the retro arcade feeling, the combo system and how it actually MATTERS and gives you amazing results for doing succesful combos, The amount of different characters that you can run through the game with in all stages and it will never get boring, and finally the boss fights are always a pleasure and if you dont got the combos down or know what you're doing will punish you; these boss fights man they really make me enjoy the game even more. I got stuck on stage  4 boss and couldnt beat til i did my 7th try but I FELT SO REWARDED. This game just is amazing.

However, with the variant difficulty levels and variety of characters, you can get a lot of mileage if you take it in small doses. Sitting down to marathon the game though will leave you feeling like the game came up short because of just how short it really is, but it has a ton of replayability for the price tag.\n\nAlso no online play on a PC game what the ♥♥♥♥.\n\nHere's to hoping that an expansion is made for the game because it is seriously entertaining.

Mode (If 2 Players are going too far away the camera will lock and enemies can get knocked out of the camera wich means that you can't hit them until they're back on screen)\n- No CPU players in Battle Grounds Mode\n\nPhantom Breaker: Battle Grounds\nis a anime beat em' up in the style of the 16bit-era with sweet 8bit-like soundtrack. You start with one of the 4 different characters. Each of those have their own abilities. As you go on in the game your character will gain exp and level up wich makes this game really addictive, since you want to max out your character and want to be able to play on harder difficulties and beat more ♥♦♣♠ out of your enemies. Well at least these were your thoughts but unfortunally without the DLC your level is capped at 50 instead of the maximum 99. Talking about the level system: you collect red crystals from defeated enemies. At the end of each round your exp will be count together and you level up. You will get skill points wich you can add on either abilities or on the stats attack, defence and speed. With the level cap of 50 you will be only able to get 250 skill points wich is barely enough to unlock all skills and boost 5 (from 30) stats. But on LV99 you sometimes feel a little OP and so you can always remove abilites and stats and make unused skillpoints. You can even reset the playerstats and abilities (but not the level) and make this game a little bit more challenging. The Multiplayer modes are also a lot of fun but as I'm writing this review it is only possible to play this localy on one PC (or Steam In-Home-Streaming) wich is a little bit disappointing. The Co-Op mode let's you play the game with up to 4 players at once. However I have a really really big issue with the Co-Op mode's camera: If 2 Players are going too far away the camera will lock and enemies can get knocked out of the camera wich means that you can't hit them until they're back on screen. This is so obnoxious if you have a high combo going on and need to cancel this out because of this! At least the coud make the Camera Zoom out like in SSB-Series if players are going too far away from each other. The Battle Ground mode let's you play VS against your friends to duke it out who really is the best brawler in this game. Just make sure that each of the characters have the same ammount of skillpoints used to make it a fair battle or handycap yourself until you get to your limits. The only thing missing there are CPU players for either practicing or just add more fun to the mess.\n\nConclusion: If you want to revisit the old 16bit beat em' up series or like animes or even both this game is just for you. Be aware that a gamepad is recomanded for this game since the keyboard controlls are a little bit ♥♦♣♠ed up and you cant re-align them like you want to have them.","October 10, 2015","true","74.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That being said Phantom Breaker is its own game and what a fun game it is.\n\nIt's a beat-em up game with anime-like characters and awesome chip-tune music. The Game can be a bit repetive for some but I love it none the less\n\nPros:\n-Music\n\n-Characters: really fun to use and you can unlock more of them in storymode\n\n-2D graphics look gourgeous\n\n-Gameplay\n\n-Stages are really nice.\n\n-Multiplayer (haven't really tested it since at the moment its only local at the moment)\n\n-Skill Point system\n\n-Lengthy: not one of those games you can really complete in one day.\n\n-Making combos is awesome.\n\nMiddlepoint\n-Later enemies are reskins of previous ones but they have their differences and look interesting. Not just some palette swap\n\n-Controls and mechanics are a bit confusing in how they work but it's enough to have fun with.\n\n-The Storymode for a single character can go on for a bit, not to long but your hands will get a tad bit tired afterwards.\n\n- The game tends to bunch a crapload of enemies into one room and with the weird guarding mechanic working only for some attacks it can get a bit difficult. Still you should enjoy beating the hell out of them with combos.\n\n- The Story is bloody confusing for these characters. Either way still interesting.\n\nCons\n-Remember when I spoke about the whole controls and mechanics thing. Yea some attacks it will block but for bigger guys or stronger attacks dodging it is very hard. Not to mention dodging itself is difficult and you can be beaten the crap out of by enemies.\n\n-You will find later on these weird blue/red ball enemies that have these tape claws or something. The mechanics make it either very difficult or impossible to avoid their attacks. That might just be me but its annoying none the less.\n\n-You better have a Controller for this because this is one of those games where the PC keyboard inputs are placed in weird places, The control help shows a console controller and you can not change the inputs at all. So yea, Have fun.\n\n-Difficulty Spikes on these bosses go up quite a bit and with the confusing mechanics. It can be difficult.\n\n\nAs you can see this game has quite flaws but don't let that stop you. I had a lot of fun playing this and with the online mode being annouced recently, maybe soon I'll have friend to play with. It's my kind of game. maybe not to all, but at least to me. Though I would recommend buying it when it goes on sale like what I did.\n\nOverall I think the game gets a 7/10. Not the best but no where near bad at all.

And the they finally changed it to saying it was Local co-op and they were gonna bring online multiplayer over the summer. That was a damn lie and 10 months after the release it still isn't here and they dont show any signs of working on the steam port anytime soon.

( With some nice 3D environment effects thrown in for flare )\nKiller soundtrack ( I would seriously pay for it )\nFlashy and solid feedback from everything in the world and every action\nHigh replayability if you're into beat'em ups\nQuite a few characters to play with once unlockedCONS\nRather short ( more thoughts on this below as it isn't really a bad thing )\nEnemies tend to be a little "spammy"\nThumb cramps OVERALL\n8/10\n\nGeneral overview\nPlays much like Scott Pilrgim Vs The World: The Game but on two planes rather than a 2.5D plane.\nConstant progression of characters gives a nice sense of accomplishment.\nRather addictive beat'em up game play that can lead to hours lost and leave thumbs sore.\n\n\nGraphics\nThe sprite work and animation really sticks out with not only each character but also with every enemy you encounter. Overall very smooth animations that link to one another very well. The environment has a nice 3D based style to it giving everything depth despite being played on a pure 2D plane. The art work from sprite to background transfers well. Everything is busy with color but it never distracted me from the gameplay. Not until all the combat had stopped and I took a moment to appreciate the little details helping the world feel full of character.\nEverything is very flashy without ( yet again ) being distracting. The feedback of lights and hit animations are really satisfying.\nEverything comes together very well.\nMy one gripe would be the minor gaps you can see every so often in the polygons of the world and the transfer screens. But this is a very minor thing that asshats like me will notice.\n\n\nGameplay\nMuch like the title gives away, this is Steams version of a Kawaii as hell Scott Pilgrim Vs the World.\nThe combo system isn't anywhere near the same though. Were Scott Pilgrim plays more like a classic side scroller ( Streets of Rage etc ); This title has a double linear 2D fight path. What I mean by this is that fighting happens on 2 planes but not at once. You can only move right or left and switch between high and low planes. It does take some time to get used to after putting so many hours into S.P., but once you get that hang of it it becomes second nature. It allows the player to get out of the way of spamming enemies and make strategic choices on how to attack.\n\nBack on the subject of the combo system. It may seem like a mindless button masher but this isn't the case.  Just mashing away will get you beaten down. Fast. While it may work for the first couple of levels, you quickly need to figure out how to block, when to use specials, when to use emergency mode and so on.  Comboing needs to be timed or you'll be struck in the back and need to figure out how to recover.\nThe more you learn about comboing and getting high hit combos, the more you'll end out leveling. The game rewards you for doing well and not losing combos much like Devil May Cry.\n\nThe Bad\nAfter a full playthrough there is very little negative about the tittle.\nThe enemies can be a little spam happy at times. Seems the devs relied a little on juggling and a.o.e. attacks to give the illusion of difficulty. These attacks aren't hard to get around, but once you've been caught in the later levels you'll see your health dwindle down with little to nothing you can do about it aside from waiting for the right moment to counter the hoard.\nThe game actually isn't too difficult either. This isn't a bad thing as it makes it addictive, but as stated above, it's moments of difficulty come from rather cheesy tactics from the AI.\nIt's rather short too. Only a few levels that can be beaten in around an hour or less. This one isn't really a BAD thing though! For what the game offers in terms of addictive gameplay and really fun combat, I personally didn't mind the length. Hell, anything longer may have felt a little dragged out. The short play time is also offset by high replayabilty with bonus characters and 50 levels of XP for each.\n\nThoughts\nI've been having a lot of fun with this one! After the take down of Scott Pilgrim I've been craving a really solid and fun beat'em up and this game does a great job at scratching that itch while giving you something totally different yet extremely familiar!\n\nDefinitely grab it if you're into S.P./ Streets of rage/ combo based games or anything like River City Ransom.","July 5, 2015","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You move on to the next part of a stage and you see 4 of the same enemy that are flying and fire homing balls of doom that explode and knock you over. It's absolutely flipping fustrating.

So as far as story goes for this game, one does exist, though a little weak Phantom Breaker does make up for it in gameplay. There are multiple characters to choose from and as you play through the game you get to develop that chosen character with skills and upgrades. The flow of the game feels right, its not too slow where it drags on, but it gives you time to enjoy kicking the ♥♥♥♥ out of your enemies. The bosses in the game are challenging if you haven't upgraded your character enough but are far from impossible.

The all fight diffrently with strengths and weaknesses. I personally like Waka and Cocoa.\n\nThe main enermies in the game are easy, you can easily button mash them to death with ease, bosses on the other hand have a Massive diffaculty spike, they interupt your attacks easily, spam you relentlessly and kill you with seconds unless you block and time attacks correctly or Just spam your EX attacks.\n\nYou need a controller if your gunna play this as the keyboard is unbearable.\n\nA few things hold this game back massively are the fact that the bosses are overpowered and cheap, spamming you to death with no way to counter. You could but they react so fast that you'll just be wasting health.\nCombat is barebones\nThe early levels are a grind and airn't fun until you get combos and/or EX attacks.\nThe game at certain points will force you to exit an area before you have a chance to pick everything up. For example you fight a massive boss with minions which could drop around 25-100 Big red gems total, but as soon as he dies your character auto moves out the area before you can pick it up.\nClaims it has online on store page.... it doesn't\nThis is small but for the achivement Good Jump you need to jump off a building and grab all the stuff without missing anything, sounds good. However moving horrizontal is fine, VERTICAL IS GOD AWFUL. You'll glide up and down with laughable control like you're sliding on ice, it's pathetic.\nVillians are boring and tedious (I like Cocao but against her is a nightmare, spam centrual)\nAND DON'T GET ME STARTED ON THE SHIRINE MAIDENS!!! They fire balls of fire, they auto lock, explode auto incapaciates your character and they continue to hit you down over and over till death. 1 is ok, 2 even BUT A ROOM FULL OF THEM!? Goodluck. Most of the time they are flying so your ex attacks won't hit. Plus attacks interupt you so goodluck getting close enough and hitting off a good combo.\nAlso No story telling.... nice... how interesting.\nThe good things are less then the bad.\nIt can be fun later on\nOnline would have made this game more fun.\nDiffrent style characters means you will find one that you like.\nNice art style and Music.\nUnlockable characters....even though all except 2 of them are ♥♥♥♥ and uninteresting.\nPrice, I got it for around £2 on sale.\n\nAll in all if you like fighting games, anime characters and 0 story just get to the stabby stabby, you could enjoy this, but if you want a decent game with a story, competant mechanics, fair system and ONLINE!!!! look else where.\n\nThis Game Gets A 5/10, it is ok... borderline average. And in some cases like spam central this game could drop to 3/10 for it's lack of features, no story, no online, no fun until later slugfest.","June 6, 2015","true","38.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I think there needs to be a rebalance with this. either make the DLC more powerful, or nerf the 2nd boss. I am able to defeat that boss with any of the other charaters, but not the DLC character.

Neither the worst nor the best port I've seen, largely depends on your expectations and opinion towards a few particular points.\n\nThe Good:\n- reasonable mechanical depth without insane learning curve of a true fighting game. If you're looking to practice some basics or get a friend into the fighting mindset without scaring him by overwhelmingly complicated move lists and combos, this is a good place to start.\n- plenty of characters and fighting styles - rush, poke, zone control, jumpy tricks etc.\n- nice background art/soundtrack (obviously per personal taste)\n\nThe Bad:\n- "GHJBY" for default keys that can't be rebound? Uh... yeah. Because it makes sense. You can rebind what button does what attack, at least.\n- Some random single-digit frame drops upon game launch until you've clicked through 3-4 menus. Nothing critical and totally fine in game, but still.\n- Difficulty levels are gated by stats. As in, they're balanced around a certain character level. Mostly a problem with bosses, as not having enough stats makes every mistake really painful.\n\nThe Ugly:\n- DLC gating character progression? Guess what, you're not getting fully unlocked move tree without it. Just consider it a part of the game's price, really. At least it's one and only gameplay-related, the 2nd being OST.\n- No online mp/coop functionality from the original game. To quote: "we're still working on other updates to the game, including the planned online multiplayer update and other revisions. Development has been slow because much of the PBBG dev team has been preoccupied with the upcoming PS4 version". That's not a good excuse for PC gamers folks. It's been like 4 months since release. I'll give it a pass for the first time just because the storefront is honest about coop being local, and I did have fun with it regardless of MP.","June 30, 2015","true","21.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You have to more or less trial and error your way. (I didn't bother reading too much so I ended up having to discover on my own before I actually read the menu tutorial.)\nI hear they're planning on adding the online multiplayer sometime soon so I decided to pick it up. I hope they will also let us adjust buttons/keys more easily. I ended up just using Joy-to-Key to use and remap my fight stick.\n\nCurrently though a glaring bug I found is I'm suddenly unable to run the game because of black screen bug on start up with Mikoto just standing there.

( With some nice 3D environment effects thrown in for flare )\nKiller soundtrack ( I would seriously pay for it )\nFlashy and solid feedback from everything in the world and every action\nHigh replayability if you're into beat'em ups\nQuite a few characters to play with once unlockedCONS\nRather short ( more thoughts on this below as it isn't really a bad thing )\nEnemies tend to be a little "spammy"\nThumb cramps OVERALL\n8/10\n\nGeneral overview\nPlays much like Scott Pilrgim Vs The World: The Game but on two planes rather than a 2.5D plane.\nConstant progression of characters gives a nice sense of accomplishment.\nRather addictive beat'em up game play that can lead to hours lost and leave thumbs sore.\n\n\nGraphics\nThe sprite work and animation really sticks out with not only each character but also with every enemy you encounter. Overall very smooth animations that link to one another very well. The environment has a nice 3D based style to it giving everything depth despite being played on a pure 2D plane. The art work from sprite to background transfers well. Everything is busy with color but it never distracted me from the gameplay. Not until all the combat had stopped and I took a moment to appreciate the little details helping the world feel full of character.\nEverything is very flashy without ( yet again ) being distracting. The feedback of lights and hit animations are really satisfying.\nEverything comes together very well.\nMy one gripe would be the minor gaps you can see every so often in the polygons of the world and the transfer screens. But this is a very minor thing that asshats like me will notice.\n\n\nGameplay\nMuch like the title gives away, this is Steams version of a Kawaii as hell Scott Pilgrim Vs the World.\nThe combo system isn't anywhere near the same though. Were Scott Pilgrim plays more like a classic side scroller ( Streets of Rage etc ); This title has a double linear 2D fight path. What I mean by this is that fighting happens on 2 planes but not at once. You can only move right or left and switch between high and low planes. It does take some time to get used to after putting so many hours into S.P., but once you get that hang of it it becomes second nature. It allows the player to get out of the way of spamming enemies and make strategic choices on how to attack.\n\nBack on the subject of the combo system. It may seem like a mindless button masher but this isn't the case.  Just mashing away will get you beaten down. Fast. While it may work for the first couple of levels, you quickly need to figure out how to block, when to use specials, when to use emergency mode and so on.  Comboing needs to be timed or you'll be struck in the back and need to figure out how to recover.\nThe more you learn about comboing and getting high hit combos, the more you'll end out leveling. The game rewards you for doing well and not losing combos much like Devil May Cry.\n\nThe Bad\nAfter a full playthrough there is very little negative about the tittle.\nThe enemies can be a little spam happy at times. Seems the devs relied a little on juggling and a.o.e. attacks to give the illusion of difficulty. These attacks aren't hard to get around, but once you've been caught in the later levels you'll see your health dwindle down with little to nothing you can do about it aside from waiting for the right moment to counter the hoard.\nThe game actually isn't too difficult either. This isn't a bad thing as it makes it addictive, but as stated above, it's moments of difficulty come from rather cheesy tactics from the AI.\nIt's rather short too. Only a few levels that can be beaten in around an hour or less. This one isn't really a BAD thing though! For what the game offers in terms of addictive gameplay and really fun combat, I personally didn't mind the length. Hell, anything longer may have felt a little dragged out. The short play time is also offset by high replayabilty with bonus characters and 50 levels of XP for each.\n\nThoughts\nI've been having a lot of fun with this one! After the take down of Scott Pilgrim I've been craving a really solid and fun beat'em up and this game does a great job at scratching that itch while giving you something totally different yet extremely familiar!\n\nDefinitely grab it if you're into S.P./ Streets of rage/ combo based games or anything like River City Ransom.","July 5, 2015","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The controls are fluid and the action exciting. The story elements, while im sure make more sense to someone familiar with the PB canon, are enjoyable enough. Tons of replay value here.

The all fight diffrently with strengths and weaknesses. I personally like Waka and Cocoa.\n\nThe main enermies in the game are easy, you can easily button mash them to death with ease, bosses on the other hand have a Massive diffaculty spike, they interupt your attacks easily, spam you relentlessly and kill you with seconds unless you block and time attacks correctly or Just spam your EX attacks.\n\nYou need a controller if your gunna play this as the keyboard is unbearable.\n\nA few things hold this game back massively are the fact that the bosses are overpowered and cheap, spamming you to death with no way to counter. You could but they react so fast that you'll just be wasting health.\nCombat is barebones\nThe early levels are a grind and airn't fun until you get combos and/or EX attacks.\nThe game at certain points will force you to exit an area before you have a chance to pick everything up. For example you fight a massive boss with minions which could drop around 25-100 Big red gems total, but as soon as he dies your character auto moves out the area before you can pick it up.\nClaims it has online on store page.... it doesn't\nThis is small but for the achivement Good Jump you need to jump off a building and grab all the stuff without missing anything, sounds good. However moving horrizontal is fine, VERTICAL IS GOD AWFUL. You'll glide up and down with laughable control like you're sliding on ice, it's pathetic.\nVillians are boring and tedious (I like Cocao but against her is a nightmare, spam centrual)\nAND DON'T GET ME STARTED ON THE SHIRINE MAIDENS!!! They fire balls of fire, they auto lock, explode auto incapaciates your character and they continue to hit you down over and over till death. 1 is ok, 2 even BUT A ROOM FULL OF THEM!? Goodluck. Most of the time they are flying so your ex attacks won't hit. Plus attacks interupt you so goodluck getting close enough and hitting off a good combo.\nAlso No story telling.... nice... how interesting.\nThe good things are less then the bad.\nIt can be fun later on\nOnline would have made this game more fun.\nDiffrent style characters means you will find one that you like.\nNice art style and Music.\nUnlockable characters....even though all except 2 of them are ♥♥♥♥ and uninteresting.\nPrice, I got it for around £2 on sale.\n\nAll in all if you like fighting games, anime characters and 0 story just get to the stabby stabby, you could enjoy this, but if you want a decent game with a story, competant mechanics, fair system and ONLINE!!!! look else where.\n\nThis Game Gets A 5/10, it is ok... borderline average. And in some cases like spam central this game could drop to 3/10 for it's lack of features, no story, no online, no fun until later slugfest.","June 6, 2015","true","38.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Where do I begin?   Set in an alternated timeline somewhere in Tokyo.   Four friends are waging a battle against the denizens of the underworld which threaten their peaceful lives.  When one of their friends is abducted and held captive by their arch nemesis, Phantom,   They set out to save her.  5MP, Mages and Division games did a great job on this port.  All the achievements are super easy to unlock.  The only drawback is that it will take hours to level up your character the way you want.   The game throws  a crutch early in the game, with good reason.    Gameplay is simplistic and easily implemented.   Your buttons or keys will attack foes, or transition with a cool 3D move called "Line"  where you can attack your foes who aren't on your X or Y axis.    The sound effects and Japanese voiceover are very well done.  They can get grating after a while,  But, the music for this game is enjoyable.  They even let you play as the other unlockable characters in story mode.  Something the Xbox and PS3 versions left out.  Although there is no added dialogue to the other characters to provide the storyline some lift.    I highly recommend this game, I'd fail to mention it's Versus modes, and Arcade Mode only for leaderboards sake.   Can you make it all the way through the hellish Nightmare + difficulty.  Normal mode is no walk in the park either.  Grab some buddies for co-op and kick some chibi-sized anime @$$.     Pick up Phantom Breaker: BG today while it's on sale.

The art style is fantastic, the music is nice and it fits the levels, the characters are appealing and there are a lot of enemies to fight. The story mode isn't very long, I'd say you could finish it in about 2 hours or so.\n\nThere are five difficulties, ranging from Easy to Nightmare+. The game overall isn't very hard though, in my opinion. It's not really difficult to get huge combos, since most of the time the enemies just stand around, waiting to get attacked. It's really satisfying to get a huge combo though, so I guess that's not a huge problem for me. These different difficulties do add replayability to the game, which I supposed is nice.\n\nOne thing I really liked about this game was the 2-lane system. Basically, there are 2 lanes you can fight in, the front lane and the back lane. This makes the flow of the game a lot faster, because otherwise all enemies would get jammed into one small area. There are some bigger enemies in this game that you can't jump over, so in my opinion, this is a great solution.\n\nNot everything in this game is that good though. The story felt a bit slapped on. I didn't really feel like I was saving anyone, I was just beating up enemies for the fun of it. I think the story could've touched a bit more on the enemies themselves. I'm pretty sure it said somewhere in the beginning of the game that they were robots, but don't quote me on that. I would've loved to know a bit more than that though. Exactly why did I have to fight all those robots. The areas could've been explained a bit better as well. Why was I fighting in those spots? You fight on beaches, in a cafetaria, in some parking spot. But why those locations? That's would like to know.\n\nAbout the controls: The keyboard controls are not as tight as they should be. I spent the first few minutes of the game just mashing my keyboard to figure out the controls. The game doesn't clearly explain the controls, some kind of tutorial would've been nice. It expects you to play with a controller, but I currently don't have one, so I had to use my keyboard. For anyone who wants to know, these are the basic controls.\n\nW: Jump (Double tap to double jump)\nS: Duck\nA: Move left (Double tap and hold to sprint)\nD: Move right (Double tap and hold to sprint)\nJ: Quick attack\nB: Heavy attack\nU: Use a combo\n\nThere are more buttons and combinations you can use, but those are the basics you need to play the game.\n\nYou need to collect XP in every stage to level up. After you clear the stage, you earn some points you can spend on either unlocking new skills or upgrading your attack/defence/speed. It's impossible to fully complete both your skill tree and your stats though, as the cap is set at level 50. After that, you do not level up anymore, so you don't earn more points to level up. This is a good thing though, because otherwise you would get ridiculously overpowered characters that can beat even Nightmare+ with ease.\n\nTL;DR\n\nHere's a small list of pros and cons for this game.\n\nPros:\n-Great levels and character design\n-The music is nice\n-Enjoyable 2-lane system\n-A lot of characters with different combos to choose from\n-The game has a lot of replayability\n\nCons:\n-Bad keyboard controls\n-Story mode is kind of short\n-Story overall isn't that good\n\nI recommend this game, but not for the full €11,99. Try to buy it in a sale, then this game is worth it for sure.\n\n","November 11, 2015","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Of course, if you don't enjoy games that you have to button-mash, then this game is definitely not for you!\n\nThe soundtrack goes very well with the pixelated art.

That being said Phantom Breaker is its own game and what a fun game it is.\n\nIt's a beat-em up game with anime-like characters and awesome chip-tune music. The Game can be a bit repetive for some but I love it none the less\n\nPros:\n-Music\n\n-Characters: really fun to use and you can unlock more of them in storymode\n\n-2D graphics look gourgeous\n\n-Gameplay\n\n-Stages are really nice.\n\n-Multiplayer (haven't really tested it since at the moment its only local at the moment)\n\n-Skill Point system\n\n-Lengthy: not one of those games you can really complete in one day.\n\n-Making combos is awesome.\n\nMiddlepoint\n-Later enemies are reskins of previous ones but they have their differences and look interesting. Not just some palette swap\n\n-Controls and mechanics are a bit confusing in how they work but it's enough to have fun with.\n\n-The Storymode for a single character can go on for a bit, not to long but your hands will get a tad bit tired afterwards.\n\n- The game tends to bunch a crapload of enemies into one room and with the weird guarding mechanic working only for some attacks it can get a bit difficult. Still you should enjoy beating the hell out of them with combos.\n\n- The Story is bloody confusing for these characters. Either way still interesting.\n\nCons\n-Remember when I spoke about the whole controls and mechanics thing. Yea some attacks it will block but for bigger guys or stronger attacks dodging it is very hard. Not to mention dodging itself is difficult and you can be beaten the crap out of by enemies.\n\n-You will find later on these weird blue/red ball enemies that have these tape claws or something. The mechanics make it either very difficult or impossible to avoid their attacks. That might just be me but its annoying none the less.\n\n-You better have a Controller for this because this is one of those games where the PC keyboard inputs are placed in weird places, The control help shows a console controller and you can not change the inputs at all. So yea, Have fun.\n\n-Difficulty Spikes on these bosses go up quite a bit and with the confusing mechanics. It can be difficult.\n\n\nAs you can see this game has quite flaws but don't let that stop you. I had a lot of fun playing this and with the online mode being annouced recently, maybe soon I'll have friend to play with. It's my kind of game. maybe not to all, but at least to me. Though I would recommend buying it when it goes on sale like what I did.\n\nOverall I think the game gets a 7/10. Not the best but no where near bad at all.

Not worth getting the soundtrack.\n- Too much grinding and not enough variety in moves to be comparable to cult hits like Guardian Heroes.\n- No online co-op, though most of my friends in my town play games like this anyway so I can always find someone myself.\n\nStill, despite all of this, especially the middle part that only ever happens to a certain amount of users, such as myself, this game was fun for the time I did get to spend with it before I began trying to get a refund for it due to the fact that it does not work anymore and it feels like I wasted my money, especially since they have yet to update the game.\n\nBut, this game still works with enough people where you would be likely to fall into that same in-crowd of users.

I have no idea what sort of situation this studio is going through at the moment but that's no excuse to release a terrible port. Sure, you can say that I should get over and just use the wonky keyboard set up and get off my high horse. However, this was to my knowledge a console game, so, playing with a controller, any controller other than an xbox 360 one should be relatively problem free. Should be is the key word because it isn't. I'm either constantly jumping or walking left continuously.

Cute pixel art, good fighting mechanics, fun combos, easy to learn, lots of depth... An interesting point is that it is a 2d side scrolling beat-em-up but it has 1v1 style fighting mechanics as well. Also it's not exactly as 'free-roaming' as most 2d sidescrolling brawlers. You'd be forgiven for expecting something like Streets of Rage with free vertical movement along the stage, but instead you are locked to two 'lines', much like the older Fatal Fury games. This of course means that to jump you press up which is... kind of awkward to get used to, but it makes sense in context.\n\nYou have four attack buttons, light medium heavy and special, and you can combine those for various special moves. There's a full set of 3 special moves done with directions and the special button (down, forwards and whilst dashing), and then also a set of various counters you can do with just the special button on its own (pressing just before an attakc, pressing just after, and also holding it for a really powerful counter/rage mode), there's an overdrive mode to increase your speed and strength, there's such a thing as a guard cancel, jumping attacks, throws... all this sort of stuff. The fact that there's 25 pages of how to play should tell you it's simple on the surface but quite deep once you get into it. Y ou CAN button mash your way through the game but you'll have more fun learning the technicalities.\n\nThe very first level of the game also gives you all the powers possible for your character, and the level itself is ridiculously easy even on normal mode (the only other difficulty other than Easy at the beginning, oddly enough), so that gives you plenty of time to test out all the moves, see how they work and see which character fits your playstyle. It's a practice stage as it were, though one that's always worth playing because of the free XP you basically get to level your character once the game begins proper.\n\nWhilst it's not immediately clear, cutscenes are skippable by pressing the select button on your gamepad (honestly I recommend playing with one just because of comfort and layout, but it's possible and easy enough to play with the keyboard as well) in case you die during a boss fight and REALLY don't want to sit through the cutscene AGAIN. ugh.\n\nSpeaking of, it is a one life and gameover type of deal. If you die, you get the gameover screen and have to continue. You still keep the XP and score you gained and that still applies to your character, even if you decide not to continue, and when you do continue it's at the last checkpoint you reached (given you're likely to die to a boss, that's usually the boss cutscene, hence why I mentioned the cutscene skip button), so it's nicely forgiving in that aspect.\n\nXP you earn goes into levelling your character you're playing with, which is persistent btw. As you level up you can choose to put the skill points you gain into their attack, defence and speed stats, or their actual skills which unlock what moves they can do, so there's a bit of a balancing act there. The vanilla game has a level cap of 50, wheras if you purchase the additional character who is from the Steins Gate anime if memory serves, you get to level up to level 99 instead. Which I assume means you can max out everything on them eventually. Given you seem to get 5 skill points per level, and the costs of each increase to stat or skill increases as you work your way through the paths, it seems unlikely you can max everything out by level 50, so choose wisely if you aren't willing to drop the cash on the level cap increase and fanservice character.\n\nIt seems like this game would really come alive with multiplayer, and it has a nice local play option and a co-op mode, though I've only been doing the single player game at the moment. It's definately interesting and a lot of fun, and the action is pretty frantic. Boss fights are against other characters usually, which fight just like a player does. This makes them challenging and interesting to fight, but they tend to spam some really nasty damaging moves, and certain bosses have attacks which do lots of rapid ones. They are blockable but if you get hit by it at any point you are in for a world of pain. This is slightly frustrating but that's what you've got things like Emergency Mode and Reflect for, of course. Also dodging to the opposite line is always an option.\n\nAll in all I'd say it's a capable brawler and a fair bit of fun. The level up mechanic works nicely with the story and also with the gameplay, though it does feel a bit frustrating having all your cool powers taken away at the beginning and having to choose between raw stats or cool moves.","July 19, 2015","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For a 2D Brawler it's got a lot of addicting fun in it. While I haven't played farther than Level 3, seeing as I'm trying to grind all my characters evenly, the game's already got a cute charm.\n\nGraphics: 9/10\nThe graphics are exceptionally well-styled and have a cute appeal. The backgrounds have that little Japanese Cartoon feeling, blending it with the Anime style makes it really pop. (Yes, Japanese have both Cartoons and Anime, they're different over there.)\n\nGameplay: 7/10\nIt's fast, fun, and exceptionally combo-tastic, it's easy to get the hang of, once you get over the awkward controls. The lack of an Online Mode is a downer, though.\n\nSound: 8/10\nThe soundtrack is really nice and poppy, it has the oomph where the oomph needs to be.\n\nReplayability and Variety: 9/10\nThis one really, really got me. Each character has their own set of skills, so leveling each one up, unlocking all of their skills, and seeing how fast you can beat levels with each one or how big of a combo you can get with each one with their different styles is really fun and satisfying.\n\nPros:\n+Colorful, vivid, and cute.\n+The Chiptune music is very poppy and bright.\n+It's fast, fun, and has a nice combat system.\n+The Skill Points go to both Stats and Skills so you have to spend wisely, making it fun to experiment with high stats and no skills, or vice versa. (Grinding exists but that's not a pro.)\n+Variety of characters to play as, with different skills and combos to pull off.\n\nCons:\n-It can get really difficult when you're being pinned.\n-The controls are really awkward and the keys which the controls are bound to aren't explained to you.\n-No Online Mode.\n\nFinal: 8.25\nOverall, it's a nice game for the price.

I enjoy 2d side scrolled in general, but this takes the cake with the retro arcade feeling, the combo system and how it actually MATTERS and gives you amazing results for doing succesful combos, The amount of different characters that you can run through the game with in all stages and it will never get boring, and finally the boss fights are always a pleasure and if you dont got the combos down or know what you're doing will punish you; these boss fights man they really make me enjoy the game even more. I got stuck on stage  4 boss and couldnt beat til i did my 7th try but I FELT SO REWARDED. This game just is amazing.

My only real complaint is that the story is really, REALLY short so you'll be playing a lot of the same stages over and over again. However, with the variant difficulty levels and variety of characters, you can get a lot of mileage if you take it in small doses. Sitting down to marathon the game though will leave you feeling like the game came up short because of just how short it really is, but it has a ton of replayability for the price tag.\n\nAlso no online play on a PC game what the ♥♥♥♥.\n\nHere's to hoping that an expansion is made for the game because it is seriously entertaining.

Really great price for a Beat 'em up arcade game.\nThe game looks great, adorable, and doesn't seem too difficult to play. Only issue is the controller. This game would NOT detect my keyboard or Logitech USB controller. I played around with some settings and I was able to use the controller finally. I was so excited about getting the controller to work and I thought people were just complaining over nothing, but boy was I wrong. I STILL had an issue. I wasn't able to use the left input on my D-Pad/Analog Stick during the selection screen. Ironically, my character walks to the left without any input! Such a cruel world we live in. I can still adapt to this little bug, but it's a little annoying. I'll never be able to save my game though since I can't select [Yes].\n\nI can always return the game, but I have high hopes the developers will fix the bugs with the controllers. I'm sure everyone would love to play this game, but these controller issues forbid us from our destiny. For now, I would not recommend this game.\n\ntl;dr The only issue I've come across with was the controller bug. Please don't ignore those complaints about the controllers.

I have no idea what sort of situation this studio is going through at the moment but that's no excuse to release a terrible port. Sure, you can say that I should get over and just use the wonky keyboard set up and get off my high horse.

The graphics and music are amazing, but theres one big problem makes me want a refund. The game is unplayable with a keyboard controls. It makes you need a gamepad to play it right, and don't even bother looking for ways to change the controls for keyboard because there aren't. Unless you have a controler, the game is kinda just slow.","April 30","false","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However I cannnot recommend to anyone with the fact that it is damn near unplayable with a controller and has been for a long time. The Devs obviously dont care so this rating won't bother them. If they would actually deign to fix this long standing and game breaking bug, or remove "controller support" so that it's honest, then the rating would change. With several different controllers (steam controller, Xbox360, Xbox One) the game either won't recognize the controller, or i get the jumping bug.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/moogleempmog/recommended/329490/","moogleempmog","Moogle Emperor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/moogleempmog/","185 products in account","It's hard to complain about repetitive, recolored enemies and relatively simple attack combos in a brawler. For better or worse, those are staples of the genre. By those standards, Phantom Breaker: Battlegrounds actually does pretty well. There's decent enemy variety, especially as you reach later stages, and as you progress you can unlock longer and more varied combos.\n\nBut therein lies the problem. Unlock. This is one of those games in which you have a progression system, it's quite slow and grindy, and you're forced to choose between boring but powerful statistical upgrades and the special abilities that actually make the combat fun. I was able to get to a point where I both had enough damage that enemies didn't take an annoyingly long time to kill, and could deal that damage in interesting ways – but in exchange I had to completely ignore defense. To raise both to the levels I would expect in a brawler, I'd have had to double my play time on the earlier stages. Since I was already getting bored with the game by the time it started to become fun, I didn't have much incentive to press on.\n\nDid I mention that those unlocks were for one character, and the game has several, each with their own abilities and dialogue?\n\nOnce you finally have enough unlocked that it feels like a complete game, Phantom Breaker: Battlegrounds is a solid brawler. The sprites are large, detailed and cute, the enemies have interesting attack patterns, and locking your character and your opponents onto "tracks" in the foreground and background proves a clever way to smooth out the positional ambiguity that occasionally haunts the genre. It just can't make up for how long it takes before the game gets fun.","June 3","false","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a mindless button-masher with cute chibi-style characters that has rather easy acheivements (WARNING: some of them are buggy and very hard to get even if satisfy all the conditions). This game is perfect one if you need some casual fun, but preapre to smash the hell out of your controller. I also recommend you get Kurisu DLC and soundtrack for the complete experience.","May 11","true","9.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
