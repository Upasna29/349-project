For home simming, i dont think anything beats XP10 though. I will be drawing comparisons in my review with 1 other game which this is often compared to - FSX (Microsoft Flight Simulator X/10) (im not even going to compare against "Microsoft Flight", that sim was pathetic....)\n\nThe differences\n\nFSX is a flight simulator, and a game in one package. it can both teach you how to fly a plane (atleast the basics) and give you fun missions to complete and rewards you with in game acheivments. It also is able to replicate, rather well, realistic flight dynamics and aircraft performance. however, i feel that FSX is a bit more buggy, alot less "modable" (free 3rd party aircraft were difficult to install in my opinion) and it feels a bit outdated.\n\nXP10 is, i have to admit, a little less user friendly. the menus and interface do not seem as polished etc, but boy is there alot you can do. Free 3rd party aircraft are relatively easy to install, a multitude of plugins exist that you can download, such as ground vehicle tows to push your aircraft back from the stands etc and there just seems to be alot more freedom in the game.\nCarrier landings for example. Xplane 10, it was very long winded, very procedural, and a bit tedious if you "just wanted to have a go at planting the damn plane on a deck". and with only the F18 to chose from, it was a bit bland. with XP10, even though the scenario would be unrealistic, i can just load a boeing 747 and click "land on a carrier" and try landing a jumbo on a nimitz carrier.\nWeather is very customizable, and can download real time actual weather with a click of a button which is pretty cool.\nLoads more stock aircraft to chose from\nloads of different scenarios (i believe you can fly on mars if you wanted, that is atleast true of my experience on XP7,8 and 9 so i assume its on 10 too)\nYou can try and bring down a space shuttle from orbit, and many other things that FSX just cant do with the base programme.\n\nYes there are issues, yes some of the stock 3D cockpits are a bit naff and not done properly, but i have never really found it such a big deal. and if you want the true realism, be it on FSX or XP10, you wont fly stock aircraft anyway, you would go and buy 3rd party aircraft by proffesional 3rd party Devs that make accurate models and cockpits etc.\n\nyou WILL need a joystick and rudder pedals, or at the minimum, a joystick with twist function for rudders. you can play with just a mouse, but lets be honest, that sucks. FSX you can play with a keyboard, but even then, joystick set up rules.\n\nso overall, what would i buy? both. i have both. i use them for totally different things. i use FSX and 3rd party payware aircraft and payware photo scenery to practice VFR aircraft navigation, and i use XP10 to practice aircraft procedures and general handling and flying, or to test myself in all sorts of different aircraft in different scenarious, like finding myself in a middle of thunderstorm in the middle of nowhere with various system failures.\n\nagain, i would stress, XP10 is NOT a game. it features "weapons", where FSX does not, but these are only for novelty value. they do not replicate the actual fire control systems or anything like that. This is a flight sim that enthusiasts or proffesionals can use.\n\nIf you are looking to buy your first flight sim or you want to learn how fly a plane, go and buy FSX\nIf you are looking for a world war 2 realistic flight sim where you can fire guns and down planes, go and get IL2 Sturmovik 1946 or Wings of Prey\nIf you are looking for a arcade combat flight sim, Tom Clancy's Hawx\nIf you are looking for a realistic combat flight sim with modern fighters, get Lock On\nif you are looking for a simulator to practice advanced things on, or experiment, or design your own creations and fly them (basic engineering knowledge required or willing to take the time to research how plane maker works), then this is the sim for you.\n\n","December 31, 2014","true","16.2"," 692 of 725 people (95%) found this review helpful 26 people found this review funny","95","692","725","26","2"

I have about 15 hours of sim time in my logbook, 12 of which were on a commercial and Transport Canada-approved version of X-Plane (the other 3 were on Prepar3D, a version of FSX), and 10 of which applied to my license.\n\nThis is a simulator, not a game. You can mess around with the fun fighters and experimental planes, but this is first and foremost a simulator. And what a simulator!\n\nIf you're like me, you find fun in a challenging radionav approach. You find fun in managing system failures. You find fun in printing out checklists and having them next to you while handling the simulator. You find fun in education and a job well done. And this is where you get it. You can tweak the simulation accuracy, you can go from messing around doing aerobatics in a fictional plane, or you can turn your garage into a full-sized flight simulator. You can do all this in X-Plane 10, and it has the added bonuses of being more accurate, prettier, and less system-taxing than FSX.\n\nFSX is almost a decade old by now, is a RAM hog, hates graphics cards, is 32-bit, and is still slow and unoptimized. On my machine, it runs terribly. But X-Plane 10 has a 64-bit and 32-bit executable, supports multi-threading, is considerate of your RAM, and looks fantastic.\n\nI spent hundreds of hours with FS2004, FSX, and X-Plane 9. Thanks to them, my instrument and radionavigation training was easy. Thanks to them, I passed the infamous INRAT on my first try. This is a fantastic simulator, simply the best on the market, and the only one worth your money. I can fully recommend this for full price, and I'm a pennypincher.","July 16, 2014","true","4.6"," 1,078 of 1,167 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","078","1","2","28"

If you're looking for aerial combat you'll be far better served by DCS World. Flight simulation whether you go FSX, P3D or X-plane is more hobby than a computer game. If you were going to get into model railways you may start with a small basic train set. If the bug bites, you soon want to add switches, scenery and new locomotives and stock. That's what x-plane is; a flight simulator starter set.\n\nYou get a couple of basic aircraft, a sky and a barren planet (inhabited by only deer and birds). X-plane does itself a disservice with most of the included aircraft as they are far from representative of quality of aircraft that are available. X-plane's clouds are stonefish ugly.\nAll the main simulators have pro's and con's. X-plane's smaller community is very committed and self reliant and there is a smorgasbord of freely available utilities and addon scenery. Some of which are pretty damn awesome considering they are free. You can get a very decent simulator experience with freeware alone. For sure, you will not minutely scratch the surface unless you're prepared to research and learn.\n\nPersonally I'd recommend budgeting for an addon aircraft in addition to X-plane. I'd suggest a Carenado HD aircraft, not because there aren't other worthy aircraft, just that if you are starting into X-plane, Carenado are consistently high quality and you're less likely buy something disappointing. If you want to go a bit further, Skymaxx Pro will fix X-plane's underwhelming skies.\n\nFlight simulators may bore your socks off but they may also change your life. X-plane is a starting point for a hobby that may be with you for years.","November 11, 2014","true","517.0"," 254 of 276 people (92%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","92","254","276","8","0"

I have and use both FSX and X-Plane and therefore have a foot in both camps. It's a case of fully realized capabilities versus future potential. From another perspective I see one nearing the end of its 32-bit lifecycle and the other very much in its 64-bit adolescence.\n\nBackground: I've been flight simming since SubLogic's C64 release, and have been firmly entrenched in the Microsoft FS camp on PC since FS5.1, although like everyone else in the day I had and used Flight Unlimited, FLY! and ProPilot. We loved the variety and happily used them all for what they had to offer. For me FS2004/FS9 was the watershed, and I was entrenched for a decade in the sim using all the familiar add-ons and a full suite of GoFlight hardware. Unfortunately my computer was firmly stuck in 2004 as well, so I avoided migrating to FSX. I was aware of and had messed around with XP during my biannual pilgrimage to Oshkosh, even chatting at length with Austin Meyer, but I was already too deeply invested in the MSFS camp. I'm certain that many can relate.\n\nI've been a licensed private pilot since 1991, with a multi-engine endorsement and lucky enough to have had exposure and stick time on some pretty cool equipment. Now as most real world guys will tell you, flying a computer is NOT the same - I don't care if the flight models are based on lookup tables or basic real-time elemental calculations, it's just not worth arguing over. Get over it.  Where there is tremendous value in simming however, is the 'process' of flight - planning, procedures, checklist habits, instrument scans, IFR approaches. For true immersion in the system look up PilotEdge and add that to your mix no matter what platform you fly.\n\nI was fortunate enough to finally build a cutting edge computer recently. As a treat, I picked up FSX-SE to see how she'd run on a modern box. Looked good and I was enthused enough to purchase Aerosoft's A320/321 (an absolutely excellent add-on BTW). Then the dreaded terrain.dll crashes started on flights lasting longer than about 60 minutes. While I understand these errors may have been largely addressed in the new FSX-SE beta patch, I am very grateful for them. They gave me pause and saved me the hundreds of $$ I was prepared to pour into the scenery and add-ons in order to bring it up to the available standards: Orbx, UTX, ASN, PMDG, et al. It's a slippery slope most know only too well, and when you finally stop and look back at all the resources you have dedicated, the thought of migrating to something totally new seems not only daunting, but is likely financially unwarranted as well.\n\nWhile waiting for a decade old piece of software to get patched by a third party so that I could run it on modern equipment and proceed to spend a great deal of money and tweaking time to get it to run correctly, the light bulb went on for me. Here I was at a crossroad and I was prepared to reinvest in the same old song and dance. Yes, it's the one tune everybody knows, but there was an opportunity to learn a new one. Even though I tried and failed to get the X-Plane demo working, I purchased the full version (10.35 currently) in order to give it an honest shakedown, flying it exclusively for a week. What that week gave me was an appreciation for just how immersive, smooth and realistic XP can be.\n\nI spent a good deal of time reading the related forums, familiarizing myself with the tips, tricks and FAQs. I found the stock 172 and Baron okay (certainly the equal of their stock FSX equivalents), but added the beautiful Carenado C340 for some GA flying. (Aside - the C340 is a nice looking package and I'm glad I have it but there are some unforgivable faults that required modifications to actually work - in particular the CDI when tuned to an ILS. Basic stuff. For shame.) Then the FlyJsim 737-200 for some good old fashioned radio navigation at jet speeds. Wonderful aircraft, beautifully modelled cockpit and convincingly realistic performance numbers. Definitely a pilot's plane. The coming IXEG 737-300 looks incredible. And I needn't mention that PMDG is developing for XP with a DC6 to be followed by one or more of their 7xx series...\n\nSparse scenery? To me it looks far and away better than stock FSX. It's nicely scalable to the hardware you're running, and XP definitely makes proper use of modern hardware. The stock mesh is great, autogen works well, the road traffic is cool, and the night lighting is the stuff of pilot training heaven. But here's the kicker - there's so much freely available from the community. I've managed to populate my XP world with all the airport scenery I will be reasonably using with a few visits to the XP ORG. And if you have a look at what's possible using world2xplane... the future looks not only bright, but incredible. Need I mention no terrain.dll CTDs or OOM errors?\n\nStock XP weather is in my opinion better than stock FSX. Dressed up with ASN and REX however, and FSX has a strong lead. But based on how close XP is getting with aircraft and scenery, the weather engine won't be far behind.\n\nStock ATC is crap. But so is FSX's. Sorry, it's just not real. I alluded to it above, but try PilotEdge to see what real ATC is. Full stop.\n\nThis has become a rather long piece, sorry about that. I suppose I felt I had a lot to say about where we've been, where we are, and where we're going. MSFS has been how it was, and largely how it is now (I include P3D here). Is it time for change? One platform is nearing a developmental dead end, albeit with some wonderful add-ons, and one is just beginning to realize its potential with continuous and meaningful support.\n\nI'll continue to use both platforms for now, I mean why not, I own both and enjoy each for what they offer. Let me be clear though - I will not be adding anything further to my FSX ecosystem, but will simply enjoy what I already have. FSX will be limited to getting my bus fix with that awesome Aerosoft A320, at least until the sim crashes with the latest .dll or OOM error. For the price of a decent FSX add-on, I would urge you to give XP a fair evaluation.\n\nIn the end I see FSX as an old woman all gussied up in makeup and a new designer dress. She looks great and is pleasant to spend quality time with, but be careful if you go out dancing - she may fall and break a hip. Now have you seen the new girl in town? Dances funny, but she's smart, modern, and has some really cool moves. You may want to meet her.\n\nMy future in the hobby is with XP. I know I am not alone.

But I'm trying to find a good flight simulator in order to get some hands on to eventually get my private ticket. Anyway, I've owned FSX for years, tinkered with it some time ago, but heard overall good things about the physics model and visuals of X-Plane 10 and decided to try it.\n\nAs far as the physics, I can't really say, it seems like the little Cessna flies okay, it's certainly a challenge to fly straight and level compared to FSX. And the visuals are better than FSX, though not as much as I expected given the relative ages of the sims.\n\nHowever, when it comes to real world flying, I find X-Plane seriously lacking in anything beyond slipping surlies VFR. The ATC is terrible, it's so frustrating to hear the scattering of AI planes being told "NO2XP, you are off course", literally every couple of second for several minutes on end. And apparently that's a bug that's been in the game for at least 2 years, according to the forums. And trying to follow the ATC instructions on the ground is a serious exercise in futility. I think of the 4 times I tried to get clearance, then taxi to the runway, then get clearance to take off, then successfully transition to an enroute center, I had 1 complete success, 1 partial success, and 2 serious failures.\n\nThere never seem to be more than 2 or 3 other aircraft anywhere in range of mine, and they always have the same call signs, the call signs are a minor annoyance, the lack of other traffic seems pretty lacking compared to FSX.\n\nSo this is sort of a mixed review, really. If you want pretty visuals and just flying around on your own, X-Plane 10 will probably satisfy you. If you want to learn  instrument flying, and dealing with ATC, flight planning, clearances and all the other parts of flying you will have to deal with in the real world, I can't recommend it.","September 16, 2015","false","42.4"," 253 of 320 people (79%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","79","253","320","18","23"

Used the VOR system to navigate to Manchester, during the flight Xplane taught me how several of the instruments worked that I glossed over playing previous flight simulators on PC.\n\nWith my plane drifting a little to the left I had to correct my heading a few times (by a small amount) but eventually arrived at my destination.

I honestly don't believe I would fly highly efficiently, but yes I could get off the ground and land.\n\nYou NEED a controller or joystick to make the game reasonable in difficulty.  There are no tutorials so learning will be a lot of trial and error(hence the 5 hours on the runway).  I used an Xbox Controller, but don't bind acceleration to a thumbstick, bind it to A and B.  If it is bound to a thumbstick it will naturally rest in 50% throttle, you can fine tune thrust in small increments with keys.\n\nI do plan on buying a HOTAS setup(ideal), but they are pricey for good ones.  The graphics are decent and can easily be modded with free content downloads(100's) on the xplane forum to suit individual tastes.  Modding is easy, took me less than an hour to put in 4.  I will most likely replace more textures/meshes later for further realism.

If you look there is also planes hat are top notch in freeware areas, surf those xplane sites.\n\nScenery, a majority of scenery files are free with a few pay for airports. In many cases you can avoid paying for any scenery files by finding a free version that might not be as good but works. In other case the free version can be  far better than pay versions. The Sim comes with lot of freeware from plugin to help you out better to scenery and planes which both make it more enjoyable. Payware exists but I really recommend learning the game before you buy payware  as it is expensive.\n\nPlugins, not worth paying for as there is always work arounds.\n\nThe simulator can be edited in so many ways that mods, downloading, and configuring is as time consuming as learning how to land.  To give one an example of how modded the game can be, i currently have 150 Gigs of sceney files, plus five paid for aircraft alone with 20ish freeware aircraft installed totalling about 5 gigs. So if you lo ve the Sim you will need 200gigs free.\n\nX-plane is not a game! There is missions (addons) but pathetic. There is no winning. To be honest there is no real objective.  You fly, you land, you fly more, you crash... you fly more...","November 28, 2015","true","34.2"," 26 of 27 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","26","27","0","3"

And good at that as well. It has many add-ons available (MS Flight sim x probably has more though) and the flying experience is good.\n\nPros:\nI have my pilots license and the handling of the planes comes close to the real thing. At least if you have good gear attached to your pc (I just have the logitech G940). I think it' s a little bit better than MS flight sim (but comparable).\n\nIt runs quite smooth on my machine although my graphics is a little older (GTX550 TI OC). I can't run it at ultra/max settings obviously because of my card.\n\nIt is new and still being cared after by the developers and modding community.\n\nCan give a nice view with the right choosen add-ons (scenery/mesh especially).\n\nCons:\nI looked up my local airfield(where I fly) and fair enough it exists. But, that's about it too. Radio communication is way off from what normally is and I see big jets taxiing. I'm not sure if they even manage to take off (~800m runway max).\n\nThat the radio communications aren't correct is something I can understand. But jets taxiing on a local airfield is just plain wrong. Devs, please fix that! It's annoying!\n\nPrice, yep it is expensive.\n\nForce feedback support. Or lack thereof actually. I did manage to get it working (but with additional add-ons).\n\nOther thoughts:\nSetting it up isn't too bad. You can install it and fly pretty fast. You'll want to install 3rd party mods after your first flight though. And that will take some time and bandwidth if you're downloading scenery. Yep it's a big game, but I think it's worth the trouble to actually sit for a moment and set things up the way you want them.\n\nThere are probably some other things wrong with the sim. I'll probably discover those when flying some more. And maybe those will get fixed anyway. It looks good and flying is great. IF you're into flying than this might be something for you. Otherwise you might want to think twice.","November 27, 2014","true","107.4"," 49 of 66 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","49","66","0","0"

It's highly detailed. People say it's the most realistic flight sim ever. Having never flown a plane in real life I cannot attest to that comment, but this program is known to be used by real life pilots for training.\nAll the DLC in this game is included in that $60 price. You get the whole world... sort of. Not the world as we know it with the unique buildings we all know, but the land masses are very accurate and the airport locations are also very accurate.\n\nThe realism, from my perspective playing many different plane sims, is a great place for any pilot to start. There are few variables to change, but they include what kind of damage you can cause the plane through overspeed or over-g. I've seen more brutal flight models in games like Il-2 Sturmovik or Rise of Flight, but I also must bare in mind that those were a different era of planes with their own set of considerations. The damage modeling in X-Plane is not extensive. This isn't a crashing simulator; it's a flight sim. Don't expect to shear your wings off with over speed or any of the extensive modeling you'd find in Rise of Flight. You'll just be greeted with a message accompanied by poorer flight capability.\n\nI do have to make a few comments about the gear I use to play the game.\nI have TrackIR, which makes looking around supposedly A LOT easier. A lot of people have to use the hat triggers on their flight sticks and I hear it's not very enjoyable.\nI have a Logitech 3D Extreme Pro or whatever it's called. It's got X, Y and Z axes and a slider bar. I can use that flight stick for full plane functionability, though the flight afficianado might want rudder pedals to go with that mix.\nMy rig is not super powerful: Radeon HD 7770, 16 GB ram and 2.8 GHz x4. The game runs at about 30 to 40 FPS with dips into 28+ sometimes. It's not optimal for this program. I would suggest something better than what I have.\n\nIt's mainly fun for me because I can make my own objectives within the simulation, though it doesn't have the premade missions that FSX had. You can also play it like a rogue-like if you want to. For example, try to make your way going North up to the very northern tip of Alaska using airports as "save" points as a sort of no save scumming/ironman challenge. The plus side to this is that the routes you can take are so varied that you will probably not see the same scenery twice.\n\nI say that I recommend it because you can do what I do and cruise your local airports and have a lot of fun trying to get more proficient at flying. You can pretend that the time spent in this program is actually training you to operate planes. Whether or not that is helpful to you is a matter of opinion and situation.","July 18, 2014","true","28.9"," 52 of 73 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","52","73","0","1"

You will need to turn up the graphics to enable HDR and FSAA rendering to get rid of the jaggies. It also takes a bit of time to set up the controls but this is because they are very universal to accommodate any controller you might have plugged in. I'd like to see a few trainer missions added with a built in instructor but there are third party addons for this. The range of planes and free DLC content for all global locations are great selling points and I highly recommend this to anyone wanting to fly something more realistic than an arcade game.","July 15, 2014","true","7.1"," 44 of 62 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","44","62","0","0"

After having accumulated 3-400 hours (previous version, non-Steam), I feel confident in making this recomendation.\n\nX-Plane is a very powerful tool, with tens-of-thousands of ways to modify it to your needs. That said, a common complaint I've heard over the years is "how do I learn to fly here?" X-Plane kind of expects you to know what you're doing, it's not a game, it's a simulator; the average student pilot will be familiar with most aspects of flight and how to get a C-172 off the ground in the first place (full power, pull back until rotation in this case, lol).\n\nYes it has issues -- graphics aren't the greatest, ATC is poorly implimented, AI flies in circles sometimes, you can't maintain low-Earth orbit in spacecraft, and ground physics could use work. Here's the deal though, on top of the 1,000's of 3rd party mods (mostly freeware), Laminar releases major updates every so often to eliminate these problems.\n\nI've been involved with the fan-based community for years, been involved in some major projects too. We have a very loyal community that is amazingly helpful and has the know-how to help you get what you want out of X-Plane -- whether that be serious flight training, flying in the worldwide multiplayer economic... thing, or just trying to make a PA-12 do Mach 28 in atmoshperic re-entry over China.\n\nBlue Skies,\n-Red","July 3, 2015","true","32.9"," 28 of 35 people (80%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","80","28","35","4","0"

It plays pretty good, even on high settings. My rig is decent, but not top of a line. In this department it is a great addition to flight sims. It is very fun to fly, has decent amount of airplanes right out of the box & a great community behind it to add lots of free planes/scenery & such.\n\nThe negative of this game is the airports... All of them are bare, only runways & taxiways. And for you to add an airport will costs you about 20$-30$, unless you can find a free airport created by other users. I honestly do not care if my airports have the correct building locations & even the correct buildings. I just wish all the airports I fly from looked like an airport & not like some weird abandoned parking lots... Unfortunately due to this reason, I do not recommend this game. It really kills the fun for me & I am not paying 20$ per airport, especially since I paid $80 for the game itself.\nAnother thing is, right out of the box it does not come with training missions & just missions in general.

I opted to purchase X-Plane as I found FSX lacking in some categories and wanted to up the Flight Sim experience.  The graphics are fantastic and the platform runs stable, which is what drew me into trying out this sim, but sadly that's where it ends when it comes to out-performing FSX.\n\nTutorials?  Nope, no tutorials at all.  You can buy some, watch some on you tube, but nothing that introduces someone new to flying otherwise.\n\nThis simulator expects that you already know how to fly, and know how to use the instrumentation.  They're not advertising this, so they're basically selling to the masses in order to lower the price and fund the project for those who already have the skills to fly in the first place and just need a bit of practice flying someplace away from their normal zone of avialability.\n\nCustomizable, well, yes, in-so-far as assigning function to keys.  Multi-monitor support?  In your dreams!  Mine had an option to utilize some instrumentation on a second screen, but kept moving from where I positioned it to where atop my active screen.  There is also several mods and add-on's to improve the graphical experience (the one feature this application excels at), but my post research into these features left me finding that the developers don't appear to bend to any of the consumers desire for improved support.  I found setup to be very difficult to figure out, plan to write down all your commands as there doesn't appear to be any kind of commend export/print feature other than a look-up while in-simulation.\n\nThe simulator AI is about as dumb as they come, at least on the ground.  There was constant chatter between the Tower AI and a taxiing flight AI to "cross runway 32, then hold short of runway 32", this same conversation repeated several times with this exact phrase.  The plane I was following attempted to turn down every single taxi intersection, then turned back onto it's original course.  On the far end of the runway it fell off into the water and began flipping around like a fish, bouncing into the air, flipping, and turning in a single spot, before finally flipping and landing upright back onto the taxi-way, where it turned straight towards me and ran me right over without even causing a crash.\n\nTraffic and trees also have no effect on collision, feel free to land and take-off on any old street.\n\nIn summation, I'm "increadibly" dissappointed in this simulator!   While the graphics and feel of flight perform extremely well, I find every other aspect of the simulator to be severely lacking in both realism and intuitive use/functionality.  I do hope they take the majority of negative feedback I've been reading and put some consideration to it for their next release/update.  FSX is so unstable and out of date, but leaves a very positive experience to it's user base that the fine folks at Laminar Research could truly benefit to use as a guide for putting together the next great flight simulator of all time!  I would like to think they're interested in training new pilots in addition to providing additional experience to seasoned pilots, at least that's my take on a good simulator.","April 4, 2015","false","9.3"," 62 of 95 people (65%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","65","62","95","10","5"

I can only assume they are from people who have wildly inflated expectations, fail to grasp flight-simulation as a study hobby/application, or they are die-hard FSX users and just can’t let go (“because X-Plane has flat trees”)!\n\nX-Plane’s minor issues are constantly being updated and worked on by a dedicated dev group that updates the sim every few weeks/months. The flight model is simply astounding. You feel the terrifying crosswind on final, you have to kick the rudder and stick in on takeoff. Jets will roll on their own without unrealistically having to provide power. Uneven runways that follow the grounds contours? X-Plane does this. And all of it out of the box. You want add-ons and payware content, then X-Plane is rapidly catching up with FSX/P3D. There are already add-on planes that surpass those for FSX. And the scenery? The freeware design community, especially scenery design, is actually better than FSX payware in many cases.\n\nX-Plane is a modern simulator and therefore performance is also modern. Where you might be lucky to get FPS in the high-teens at best in FSX in a complicated add-on at a detailed airport with traffic with a killer PC, you’ll get double-that, locked at a solid 30FPS and possibly more, in X-Plane. There are no freeze-frame stutters on final. No Out of Memory, No .cfg tweaking required. It just works.\n\nIf you want a desktop flightsim experience with accurate modeling of the forces you have to wrestle against when flying, then X-Plane delivers with amazing results. Vanilla it is great, but embracing addons will turn it into as complex a sim as you want it to be. FSX cannot and does not compare, simply because it was released in 2006. And at that, the basic flight model stems from 2002. In fact X-Plane delivers in so many areas that I completely removed my 20 year affair with Microsoft Flight Simulator from my PC.\n\nIt has a way to go in areas such as traffic and seasons, but there are workarounds available. Bottom line though is this, if you want to learn and experience flight, and then expand upon that in the same simulator, X-Plane is the only modern player. Note: DCS-World also delivers on a supremely high standard but it’s combat only in limited theaters.\n\nEnjoy!\n","May 12","true","226.8"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","15","16","0","0"

Go nuts. It might not even get off the ground, but this is not going to stop you from trying without it looking weird.\n\nWant to have a tiny Cessna tug a massive 747 into the air via a small tow rope?

You better hope your wings are strong enough because they WILL snap off (if you do not break apart on the way down).\n\nYes it looks bare but there are plenty of free addons out there that you can install. Some are pretty, others fix things in the core game, while others are crazy user creations.\n\nThe simulator is very much a platform for you to improve and make what you want and it will give you a highly accurate flight model with minimal effort on your part.\n\nYes it might be silly to spend 60 dollars on a simulator. But if you are into flight simulators, it could be the best 60 dollars you could spend.\n\nThis is not for everyone.

My Rig is an AMD FX 600 6 Core processor 3.50 Ghz boosted to 3.80 (Corsair Liquid cooled); EVGA GT 740 4Gb Graphics card; 12Gb (3x4Bg Corsair Vengeance) RAM.\nUntil I was given some STEAM games vouchers for Xmas I was 'flying' Microsoft FSX Gold Edition, with add-on buy=ware helicopters, as well as add-on scenery, and was pretty well happy with it. However, since buying the STEAM X-Plane 10 I very rarely fly FSX at all now. Maybe it's the novelty of having a change from FSX or it could be that I generally prefer the features and realism that X-Plane 10 gives. I'm not fully sure yet as it's still early days for me but I intend to stick with X-Plane for the forseable future at least.\nI don't want to knock FSX too much though as, once you are able to tweak the cfg file correctly & eventually find the right settings for your own pc rig it 'flies' pretty well, and with certain add-on scenery it can look pretty damn good too.\nLikiewise with X-plane 10, I'm still learning how to get the best perfomance for my own pc spec, but I do like the fact that all of the 'trial and error' spec changes can be made in-game from the more than comprehensive settings options. One problem I do have at the moment is low frame rates. I use a 32 inch HD tv as my monitor, but tend to have to drop the in game screen resolution from 1920 x 1080  down to 1280 x 720 to get decent frame rates ie (20 Fps+).  But that's something I'm prepared to put up with. for the time being at least.\nOverall, after downloading a purchased add-on Bell 407 helicopter, I'm spending most of my personal free time flying the Bell 407.

That said , the sale price is decent for Global since that is around 80 dollars or so retail and with this you get the global textures.

As a private pilot there are many things I like about this product to keep skills sharp as the price of Avgas in recent years has kept me out of the skies as much as I would like.  I've felt X-Plane has been better for that than FSX.  If you are wanting something to keep skills sharps in having to manually switch radios and such in the real world this is a great product for a pilot or student pilot.  For the more casual audience, those factors would likely annoy many and FSX is probably more up your ally.\n\nProbably the biggest complaint is the scenery and lack of real world details.  The runways are accurately modeled, but for most airports there are no buildings, etc..  City skylines are also lacking in detail.  As an example, if I fly around St. Louis in FSX the Eads Bridge, stadiums, old courthouse, new courthouse and several other iconic downtown buildings are modeled.

For example, I don't care much for how pretty the graphics are.\n\nThe aerodynamic model is said to be generated in situ, like a wind-tunnel model, which makes the behaviour of the aircraft much more realistic than any other simulator I've used before.\n\nThe weather engine simulates proper low visibility, icing and turbulece, however the clouds have a huge effect on computer performance (framerates) and a very decent pc is required to run this simulator.\n\nNeedless to say this simulator is worthless without a good joystick. My own setup contains a yoke, rudder pedals and a throttle quadrant. The configuration of all the switches, handles and axis are somewhat harder to figure out compared the FSX, but the flexibility is much better in the end.\n\nThe default aircraft that come with x-plane are of comparible quality of the FSX default aircraft, and therefore utterly useless. Where FSX has hundreds of good (often payware) addon-aircraft, X-plane only has a handfull. I purchased x-plane mostly as a future investment in anticipation of better add-on aircraft. I am very positive about the Saab 340 from x-aviation .com\n\nThe manipulation of buttons and switches in the virtual cockpits are not as intuitive as in FSX and even when bound to hardware buttons, setting radios and instruments can be quite a pain. Especially for flying modern aircraft with lot's of automation this is a bit of a pain.\n\nOverall I would recommend it, when used properly it can be a usefull training tool.\n\nEasa commercial pilot with 3000 hours on twin pistons and turboprops.","April 8","true","95.9"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

As I am a general aviation pilot I was especially keen on the physics engine for general aviation aircraft. FSX always lacked good flight dynamics. Gladly X-Plane is very good with this aspect of flying. Doing touch and go's on a small airport with a good cross wind component (wind coming from the side) is a very enjoyable experience.\n\nThe cross wind landing is a very good indicator of how good the physics engine is. Let me explain by describing the procedure.\n\nWhen wind is coming from, let's say right, then the airplane will be pushed to the left of the center line of the runway. To compensate this you have to steer into the wind. Doing this the nose of the aircraft will be pointing to the right of the runway. The propeller pulls you back on track so to say. However you'll be flying a bit sideways which is not ideal for a landing procedure. So to make the nose of the aircraft point to the center line again you will need to press the left pedal on your rudder pedals to push the nose to the left.\n\nThis procedure can be summarized as 'Stick in the wind, opposite rudder to compensate'.\n\nSo in this case your stick or yoke will be set to the right -in the wind- and your left foot will be in the forward position.\n\nDoing this in real life will set your aircraft on a fixed line towards the runway and give you a real good feel of control.\n\nNow it becomes interesting as the touchdown will change too. When approaching the runway in this configuration touching down will first occur on the side of main gear at the windy side. So in this case it will be the right main gear wheel that touches the tarmac first. Followed by the left side and then the nose wheel will gently touch the tarmac.\n\nI never got this to work in FSX. X-Plane follows this perfectly and it tells me that they've got it right.\n\n\nSecondly the engine is still maintained where FSX has remained as it was when it was released years back. This means that the X-Plane engine makes much better use of your video card and is easier on resources. This last part is important. It is stable. FSX crashed many times. Often when I was flying for an hour which in a flight simulator is very bad because you have to start your journey again. This hasn't happened yet in X-Plane.\n\n\nThen the graphics. Some reviewers say that FSX is better with graphics but this isn't necessarily the case. Agreed, the graphics look a bit dull when first installed but I found a few tutorial video's on YouTube how to make the lighting different so that shadows are more prominent and colors are much richer.\n\nThat combined with a ton of free scenery which can be added makes for a very realistic experience.\n\n\nLast positive point is that they made it multi-platform so that I can run it native on my Linux machine. The only downside is that some add on development companies just don't want to make a Linux version of their add on. I had a conversation of a representative of X-aviation.com about their SkyMaxx add on. They just don't want to invest their time. And that is a shame as a developer needs less or no extra tooling to build an add on when building for Linux. Luckily most add on packages work just fine.\n\nOne last note. It's a simulator. When you are more into arcade this will not be for you. Check YouTube to see what it's like if you are unsure.\n\nHappy flying and try the cross wind touch and go's. The are really fun!\n\nCheers!\n\nTFK","March 19","true","21.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

Still have small problems with calibration mostly on the trims  but I’m sure I will get there.\n\nAgain for an advanced sim it does not offer much in advanced terrain, airports etc, a couple of nice treats for the simmer would have been  nice, that said there is plenty on offer as add ons and if you are like me, I don’t mind the purchase if it makes a huge difference and from what I have seen they do.\n\nATC why so difficult why so restrictive and complicated.\nThe use of two screens, I had 3 in FSX, pop up and drag in to position and size to screen  simple. XPlane...  don’t go there  its not worth the hassle just made a mess of my screens, click on one and the other goes, or it overlays the other, drop down menus disappear and forget about flying until your back to one screen,  FSX simple, XPlane so complicated. I will get there just need to do more time on the workings of it all.\n\nThat would be my main bug, why have the creators made it so complicated to set up, forget about the sim, set up has nothing to do with flying, it would be of no surprise that XPlane steam version will lose many a keen flight simmer due to this complicated set up of even the basics, needs sorting out and refining creators you owe the purchaser that much.\n\nOK I'm flying and boy am I enjoying it, start exploring the sim for what it is and for what it has to offer and you will not be disappointed with the default offerings, there is enough there for hours of enjoyment, even more if you intend to upgrade now and again, it really is a sim that will delight and with so much in the pipeline this is going to give many years  to the dedicated simmer.\n\nI really understand the frustrations of others, but I think that if you give it time and not be in to much of a rush to step inside the cockpit and take off within 1minute of downloading it, you will eventually sit back and realize the small price you paid was worth it.\n\nThe sim is as good as I was hoping it to be, and from that statement I can only see it getting better in time.\n\nThe developers have in my opinion let themselves down in areas, to attract new simmers they really need to take a page from FSX when it comes to the set up, take away the old and bring in some nice eye candy and simplify ATC, rendering options and such like, terminology is only of use to those who understand it.\n\nDeveloper should throw in  a 3d heavy and a 3d general aviation aircraft of the highest spec  and at least one area of photo real scenery with an airport, to tease is to please is to encourage.\n\nOverall simply fantastic, a great purchase a great sim ( If you manage to hold out that long)  Don’t ponder on the idea of getting it, do it and you will enjoy.","August 10, 2015","true","333.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

NOT A FLYING GAME!\n\nAn unbiased opinion from someone who flies over 20 flight sims.\n\nBeing a lover of flight sims I have all the major ones.\n\nIf your looking for a game, KSP or Ace combat might be more up your alley.\n\nIll compare this to Microsoft flight simulator for comparision\n\n\nFlight Model\n\nMicrosoft Flight simulator 10 (FSX) uses a variable chart to determin how an aircraft behaves inflight. So the control surfaces moving in game are more or less jjust eye candy. As a file controls the aircrafts variable movements. Not to bash FSX but it gives a more mechanical feel to flying. Less natural. However it is less processor intensive and easier to learn\n\nXPlane uses an advanced blade theory dynamics. Which models of airflow to calculate how the surface would behave in the air condtions. So moving a control surface actually affects the movement of the air. Giving i a far more realistic feel. Its far more difficult to fly and spin outs are to be expected.\n\nTerrain:\n\nFSX uses real world terrain data. Its a fairly low resolution so it can appear to be blocky in some places. However DSX also uses real world road maps and places large cities with real land marks. So you can easily fly around your home town and VFR flights.\n\nXplane 10 Uses a simular real world terrain model at a higher resoultion. Making mountains much more realistic. As well as the weather effects acting upon them. However real world cities are absent. Although using satelite images the engine places cities and town in the right places. Just don't expect to be flying over the Sears tower in chicago.\n\nFSX uses the same data files to determine aircrafts ability to move in the weather. It feels very clunky and un natural. Adjust for winds and temputures at variing levels\n\nXPlane 10 again uses blade theory. However it only accounts for ground level and altitude of your aircraft. Meaning a cross wind at the airfiled will affect a plane on land almost as much as one at altiude. However Xplane 10 uses an active model radar. So you can in theory actually fly into a hurricane in real time and watch it on radar.\n\nAircraft Models:\n\nFSX comes with a slew of highly detailed aircraft. All with 3d cockpits and working insterments. So you can fly that little puddle jumper to an F-18 right from the get go.\n\nXplane10 does have a lot of aircraft but many do not come default with 3d interiors. Most have some sort of 2d panel that will sufice for flying.\n\nCombat:\n\nFSX sucks\n\nXpalne 10 Sucks\n\nDCS world is free. You have no excuse to not have it.\n\nMulti player.\n\nFSX has a clean and simple interface that allows you to browse and favorite servers. A modern design thats clean and user friendly.\n\nXplane allows only direct connect. So I hope your computer skills are alright.\n\nPersonal conclusion:\n\nFSX is more about the experience of flying. Weather just goofing off or flying across the world to see the sights. I often will just plot courses to sight see various places and to learn to use the systems in the game.\n\nXplane 10 is more about learning to fly. Which lets face it. Weather you bought FSX or Xpalne is sorto f why you bought either. Xplane is just more about the feel of flying than flying. Its a great product and why I was happy both came to steam.\n\nAnd totop it all off most of the advatnges what one or the other sim has can be negated with addons. BOth free or payware. So it really boils down to how serious you are about flying. I often enjoy total realism in Xplane so more often than not its my go to sim.\n","January 18, 2015","true","52.7"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","8","12","2","0"

However, easy to install mods are available for both, including Winter_Package for seasonal textures, and XPGFS for upper-level weather. Wind transitions are fairly smooth, however cloud transitions are less so. Add-on weather engines are currently in development.\n\nTerrain graphics are excellent, and upgradeable with free mods, and paid add-ons. Airport scenery is generally complete as far as runways and taxiways, but buildings are frequently missing. This can also be rectified by downloading free scenery mods, and using the WED tool available from X-Plane's website, it is easy to build your own.\n\nX-Plane is in active development.\n\nIncluded aircraft vary from terrible to okay, however this is normal for flight simulators. Add-on aircraft are very good.\n\nBefore buying X-Plane, FSX, or even P3D it's important to understand that all simulators are underfeatured out of the box, and add-ons, generally paid are needed to reach the sims full potential. The base simulator can generally be considered one part of the simulator 'system'.\n\nThat said, with one paid add-on(a Carenado aircraft), and a few free ones, X-Plane surpasses FSX for GA flying, and with an improved weather engine and more add-on airliners will surpass FSX for airliners as well.\n\nDon't buy add-on aircraft off steam, insteady buy from a flight sim website(x-plane.org, for example), or direct from the developer(carenado.com , for example). Better support from the developer is available this way, as is a larger variety of aircraft. Most add-ons aren't available on steam, both for FSX and X-Plane. FSX in particular has a great deal of excellent add-ons, none of which are on steam.\n\n","February 22, 2015","true","25.0"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

The only other that comes close is DCS World, but that's a military simulator.\n\nI used X-Plane 9 to help with my instrument and procedure training and it was closer to the real thing than any other flight simulator out there and I've tried almost everything since the days of the 48Kb computers. From X-Plane 9, the 10 is an evolution with much better features and 64bit support.\n\nRemember, this is a simulator, not a game. You may find it harder to control an helicopter in X-Plane than in other "simulations" out there. If you prefer to experience the real handling of such aircraft, X-Plane is for you, just be prepared to crash a lot while learning, otherwise go for other easier titles.\n\nI like to think that X-Plane is much more a piloting simulator than a button pushing simulation, so smaller and more hands-on aircraft are preferable to big flying computers to really enjoy it, but that's probably just a matter of preference.\n\nSome of the aircraft included in the base X-Plane are old and poorly designed, as is most of the world scenario, but you can find a lot of freeware online. Some of the payware is also nice but it's a pity that only a fraction is in the Steam DLC, maybe some option by the publisher, Aerosoft.\n\nAs a downside I believe X-Plane Steam integration leaves a lot to be desired. Laminar Research just took a lazy approach to publishing on Steam and there isn't even correct Steam Overlay integration and neither the much wanted Steam Workshop.\n\nIMHO, X-Plane is the best civilian flight simulator out there and it's still evolving.","February 24, 2015","true","139.7"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

Even at paying 60$ and 5 gb, I was very underwhelmed by the amount of content provided. If you want to add any scenery, a single continent contains almost 80 gigs of scenery, which the scenery is good, but the space taken up by that is ridicilous. If you cannot afford 80 gigs for scenery, you are left with bare oceans as the scenry. You get a decent collection of planes for free. But if you want any other models, other planes worth downloading cost anywhere from 10 to 30 dollars off of various sites. Then if you want to further enhance, or make more realistic the experience, you might have to add plugins. The game is expandable in many many ways, but I find it quite absurd the amount of space actual scenery takes up, and the cost of having to download new planes into the game.

That's easily remedied by grabbing free content from x-plane.org or payware airports if you're into that.

It uses higher resolution texturing and newer landclass data, which helps some areas look closer to how they look today.\n\nAdditionally, acquiring this via steam is significantly more convenient than having to either buy a dongle from laminar, or leave an optical disc in my PC.

Whilst FSX is great and is the gold standard, it's old architecture places limits on it which we have pretty much reached now. X-Plane 10 is the ONLY 64bit high fidelity general  flight sim and that is able to fully use today's hardware. Add to that the fact that its flight model is more accurate out of the box than FSX and you have a recipe for success. Right?\n\nThe flight model is good. The planes don't feel like they fly on rails (unlike stock FSX). The auto-gen scenery and effects are very good. The environment is gorgeous straight out of the box. It runs smooth as silk on my machine. But... I only put a few hours in the sim before regretting downloading it's 50 odd gig of content and returning to FSX. Why?\n\nPart of the joy of sims for me is immersion and level of fidelity to reality. Whilst X-Plane 10 hit the ball out of the park with flight modeling, its "plausible world" just simply isn't. I was dismayed to discover there are very few runways or airports with any buildings on them. Almost all of them are just flat strips on the ground with no buildings, no life, and no feeling of having actually arrived at a destination. Every landing feels like a landing on some remote bush strip in the middle of nowhere. In addition, the various cities and locations don't actually look much like those locations.  You have to go to great lengths with addons to rectify this sitation, and even then it falls short of the mark.\n\nThe cockpits of the default aircraft look like they were made a decade ago (I think some were!) and a number of the 3d virtual cockpits just dont work at all. I was so disappointed that I felt the need to drop some money on a plane from Carenado on day one, just to enjoy the experience. This was a major disappointment.\n\nAnother area that X-Plane get's let down on is developer support. Compared to FSX or Prepar3D, there is very little in the way of professional addons, scenery packs, and aircraft. X-Plane does have a thriving amateur community creating content... but that is exactly like it sounds.\n\nOh, the UI is clunky as hell and the loading times are a nightmare!\n\nAll that being said, I do enjoy the feeling of flight in X-Plane 10 and it does run very well. If you only care about flight modeling and the feeling of flight, and can live with scenery that doesn't reflect the real world then this is a great sim and I recommend it. If you are new to sims, it's Steam access makes it a great and easy place to start.

My catalyst for buying X-Plane 10 was to see how it compared to FSX (which I also own through Steam) because an instructor at a local flight school mentioned that his lower level simulators for the students used X-Plane 10. That got me interested... what first caught me off guard when using X-Plane 10 the first time was the sloping runways (runways can be selected to follow the contours of the ground) so, no more flat runways like seen in FSX... not to say this is better or worse, it's just a fact. I was also pleased to find my Navigraph subscription could be used to update some nav data for the gps within X-Plane 10!

(Much detailed.)\n-Little bit better sounds.\n\nCons:\n\n-Really really bad joystick optimization.\n-ATC, it is bad as, 123.\n-Airports which are not coming with stock, only taxiways and runways.\n-FSX has better add-on support.\n-FSX comes with much more stock planes. (You can add a lot of planes for X-Plane for free. Still you have to pay for really detailed planes for both games.)\n-FSX much cheaper on Steam. (I bought FSX for 8 Turkish Lira, X-Plane 10 for 44,5 Turkish Lira. 1$=2.70 TRY)\n\nI will go on with X-Plane because it is running good on my PC. (FX6300, R9 270) In the other hand, we can not use FSX Steam version for VATSIM or IVAO.

Cue 15 minutes of searching forms and wading through bloated menus just to get BASIC flight controls and simulator functions. Okay, it's whatever, I can get past it. Start flying, and my little Cessna is so out of trim, it's ridiculous! Try to find the trim controls within the honestly subpar VC, realize the camera controls aren't very intuitive either, spend another 5 minutes figuring that out. Okay, I think I solved the big issues, time to enjoy! Load up KMSN, the closest regional airport to me. I look around and there is nothing on the airport except pavement and tarmac. More forum searching. Find out that x-plane has accurate airport layouts, but is missing the wonderful airport autogen features in FSX, meaning about 23000 out of the stock 25000 airports in the game are simply 2D models with no buildings. That's it.

(it is not a 'game').   As of 3/3/15, X-plane 10 offers a seemingly decent form of aircraft, flight, and limited airport simulation. This comes at the expense of a UI, a functioning Main Menu, any form of missions or objectives, any form of training or practice.\n\nX-plane 10 is quite literally *just* a simulation of flight, at the expense of any grace or sense of direction outside of what the user puts into it and what flights or flight situations the user creates themselves.\n\nThat is not to say that, for experienced pilots this program wouldn't have it's uses, in fact I think that is it's intended audience, experienced pilots who have the basics down quite well already. This is not an introductory course.\n\nNow, this much is my fault and I admit it openly, I purchased this in err, without looking this up. I was looking for an introduction to flight, this was literally my first ever flight sim purchased, I saw how it looked visually, read some favorable reviews, and figured that X-plane 10 is a top notch product.\n\nAt the high price of $60.00 USD, I expected things like a functional User Interface, a main menu, some wise setup that would let you set some important factors like controls and video settings, sound settings, etc. before entering the game.\n\nI started up X-plane 10 to immediately be placed in an aircraft on an airfield, with resolution and performance issues. I went about figuring out the controls, setting the video settings, etcetera. I found out this program is nothing if not the raw material with which you, the user, can use to create your own scenarios and flights. I still have annoying issues with camera movement, (I use a controller and have used a joystick setup as well), wherein clicking in some areas will blip out to the desktop for a second, cameras resetting to odd positions into weird directions for no reason, and generally some performance issues (low frame-rate, even with a 64-bit version of Windows 8).\n\nThere is zero incentive to purchase this product if you are a beginner, if you're looking for an introductory, learning experience into the flight scenario, if you expect missions, tutorials, a proper main menu, flights, a convenient set-up then you'll have to look elsewhere.\n\nIf you know how to fly so-and-so plane, and could probably perform a successful flight and landing with no hand-holding whatsoever if you were placed into a fueled version of said plane in an airport, I imagine this would be a very entertaining program for you, and maybe even a good source of practice. If setting up your own flights is your thing too, I'd think you can enjoy this. For this price I simply can't recommend X-plane, in it's very rough and wanting current form.\n\nInstead, I will recommend Microsoft Flight Simulator X Steam edition. Though an older title, I pull a much superior performance on it, it has a proper UI, it is far easier to work with, has an actual main menu, and also will give missions and challenges, tutorials and training for beginners as well as a place for experienced pilots to work with.\n\nFor a program that comes off as rough as this, I just don't feel the price is justified.","March 13, 2015","false","5.4"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","8","17","0","3"

This is one of the worst simulators I have purchased. I have purchased every FS since 1983 and to compare what you get for your money out of the box to FSX is ridiculous. FSX gives you graphics and missions and different airplanes all for the original price. This gives you almost nothing. The free scenery downloads from Steam are terrible. There is not even the statue of Liberty in New York. I have just downloaded over 30 Gig of scenery and it is so unrealistic I can't even compare to FSX. I will be asking for my money back from Steam! Never been so dissapointed in a game that I was so looking forward to getting.\nI would also like to add that compared to FSX, the cockpits seem to be non functional as a lot of the controls on the display do not do anything especially in the 747. I am not sure where or how this is considered the best Simulator unless there is a lot of geeky work I have to do to make it seem more real. After painstakingly setting up my complete flight yoke and pedals to operate all controls I actually find it is nowhere near a real. It seems very oversensitive with some controls and absolutely dead with others. With FSX it is really noticeable of the difference between flying and Airbus and a Boeing. Of coarse with Xplane you can't compare because you have such a limited choice and again the cockpits are archaic compared to FSX. The controls to pan around the cockpit are bad, when zoomed out all the way, you cannot see your controls and the windshield at the same time. I have this set up on  a 120" screen and I have a massive windshield in my view or a massive set of controls. you have to pan up and down continually. I am really confused as to why this gets either very good reviews or terrible reviews. There must be something we are missing! If anyone knows what we, who are not recommending this program, are missing, I would really appreciate some feedback as this is one of the worst simulators/flight programs I have every used because of the lack of user friendly interface or GUI. Old fashioned menu's with way to many settings and selections. Kind of reminds me of the old DOS days where absolutely everything had to be inputted.","June 16, 2015","false","6.1"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","2"

A plethora of missions, seasons, a nice roster of default aircraft and tutorials - this simulator has none of that. You are more or less purchasing the engine this game was built on.\n\nIts a nice engine, mind you, since the blade-element based aerodynamics do provide a more fluid flying experience to say, FSX or Aerofly. But this does nothing to negate the inconsistent quality of the default aircraft, the godawful air traffic control, the supposedly advanced scenery generator, which doesnt end up looking all that good anyway and the depressingly ugly AI, to name a few issues this simulator has.\n\nAt the moment, I would only reccomend this sim to experienced simmers who understand what they are getting into with this product. With some additional add-on content, you can actually make this simulator into something special, but  this simulator, as is, is a $60 money sink that is probably not worth your time as of now.\n\nBuy FSX instead, a sim that was made almost 10 years prior.","August 19, 2015","false","60.0"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","2"

No. How can you compare the two/three? First FSX is old but good and has a lot of add-ons for it. Same goes for P3D. X-Plane 10 has 64bit and better use of system hardware. Out of the box with the included scenery on most systems it will look better than FSX/P3D. Aircraft behave and react more realistically in X-Plane. Most airports have no scenery so it’s a barren world but it is easy to find DLC for most big airports around the world. You can make your own with the tool provided if you have the time and energy to do so. It’s a little harder to get started with X-plane but once you get the hang of it your good to go. It can do more than the others and has an easy API system to interface with if you know what you are doing. It’s more of a programmer’s sim as in if you can program there not much you can’t do with it.","December 27, 2014","true","196.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Come on.\n\nBesides that, using the Steam Client DLC view also, always  takes me to the app's web page that says i can activate the optional DLC content using the steam client. Really? Where?\n\nWith the knowledge that X-Plane (company) is not to blame, (just wondering if it was the right decision to give Aerosoft the resposibiity to build the steam version, I give both them and Aerosoft cudo's for their quick responses to my support requests. Think I'll get any support from the Steam developers? Sorry... no... they're too busy for them to answer e-mails, or too busy with other things for them to develop their support web site properly so I can add multiple attachments without losing the info on all the other fields.\n\nLast but not least, if you've got the DVD set, or thinking about getting it, this game is for you. If you've got the Steam Windows version, good luck. This is a really good game from what can be gleaned from all the videos and other resources out there.

But, it's decent if you're dedicated and can get into it. Setting the game up for basic flying with a joystick is quite simple, the gps systems on some aircraft are quite easy to use, although simplified in the stock aircraft. Over all the basic sim functions are easy to grasp.\nBut what I like to do the most is to select an aircraft with full 3D interior, turn on Aircraft>AI Flies Your Aircraft, move around the aircraft using the arrow keys, comma periods and right mouse button in the 3D cockpit command look view, and just observe the scenery from the passenger window as the AI flies you to a random location, unfortunately it doesn't seem like you can specify any particular route.\nStill, if you're in any way serious about flight simulation, you have to get x plane. If Prepar3D runs poorly on your system, get x plane. If you just wanna take virtual plane rides in any aircraft stock or addon, x plane will let you do so (although it is a generic AI pilot so results may vary).\nOthers will attest to the fact that x-plane is a virtual wind tunnel that can let you test your own designs, that it has the most realistic aerodynamics. While the stock scenery has its problems eg. transforming the metropolitan high rises of Hong Kong into small suburban buildngs, the lack of any tutorial, that's a small price to pay for the unparalleled level of optimization and sophistication and realism and function that X-plane offers. Besides, now that X-Plane is on steam, you can benefit from steam sales.","December 24, 2014","true","980.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

You can do a lot of cool stuff like fly the space-shuttle, make your own airplanes (with a lot of time and effort put into it). And even go into space.\n\nMy favorite part though is that the airplanes in this game feel real. I've flown in a lot of small aircraft and they have this feel to them that X-Plane 10 simulates very well. FSX just doesn't feel quite right with certain planes, they feel too stiff, or too light.\n\nAlso the realism is absolutely top notch. I've played multiplayer which is pretty fun too, and practiced flying in formation, I was suprised that in this game there actually is backwash from jet engines. So you can't fly in someone elses backwash or you will pay the price.\n\nThis game also has some weapons put into it, they are difficult to use though, and although they explode they don't really do damage to scenery or anything. They do damage planes but the damage is largely functional not visual.\n\nI have never been thrilled with the helicopters in this game however. I've never been in a helicopter before but they are a real challenge to fly in this game.

When I decided to uninstall Boot Camp et al for more drive space, I thought X-plane would be on par with MS Flight Simulator X. After all, most people in the sim community talk about the two games concurrently. And X-plane is very proud of how their aerodynamic models are better than those of FSX. Now, after +240 hours on X-plane, I can say that those aerodynamic models seem to have come at the cost of every other aspect of the game.\n\nHere's the good: most of the time, you can sync real world weather into the game. Also there is a good size community of free- and pay-ware DLC too. Finally, the flight models are great. A note on that last point, from where I'm sitting they are no better than FSX for the vast majority of flying.\n\nHere's the bad: the ATC is worse than useless. The game crashes often. The real weather updates every hour and every new map and the changes are immediate. The UI is a pain. And lastly there are errors in the weather radios.\n\nThe ATC is breathtakingly bad. Here's the bottom line up front; you either file an IFR clearance or you don't use your radios at all. There is no in between. If you aren't on an IFR plan, there are no ground controllers, no towers, no traffic, nothing at all. It’s a radio wasteland for anything but weather. When you do want to file an IFR, the overwhelming majority of the time, I cannot get it to respond at all. I've looked up online help and searched the forums, but from where I like to fly out of (KUAO) they just do not respond. It’s a complete failure, and nothing ruins the immersion more than taking off at KLAX without talking to a single controller.\n\nThe weather sync is interesting and fun, but it makes the game more unstable. It also makes flying more interesting than it needs to be. When I said, “the changes are immediate,” I meant one second the wind is 030@13 and the next moment, it’s at 240@30. It makes things very interesting indeed. I've had it go from sunny to stormy in as long as it took to read this sentence. And the manual weather UI is, along with a lot of other points in the UI, useless. Random weather? Okay but it'll be 20 degrees C most of the time. Want to see where your plane is on the world map? Okay but click anywhere on the globe and poof, your transported there, oh and at the same altitude. My An-24 (a really well done payware machine I really recommend) responds badly to being transported into the inside of a mountain. Finally, I know at least some of the AWOS channels are wrong, for example KAST gives you the weather for Olympia, WA, which is not near to the airport.\n\nIn summary, the X-plane people seemed to have focused on only one part of making a flight simulator: the flight. And it's great, it really is, however, it comes at the expense of everything else in the game. It’s hard to enjoy the flight dynamics when you're on final at KSFO with silent radios and a cross wind that just changed 180 degrees in less than a second. I think comparing X-plane to FSX is like comparing a super car and a sports car for a daily driver, let's say the Porsche 911 GT2 RS to a Porsche 911 Carrera. Both are great cars; fast, fun, and exciting. The first can do +200mph. But the second has air conditioning and a radio. Which do you think you'll use more?","January 2","false","379.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

As a base game compared to FSX (which is still the best flight sim unfortunately) it's not very good. I downloaded a ton of GB's of data and I don't know where it went but I don't see anything worth all the storage this application takes up. I just did a takeoff from KORD and there were trees in the middle of the runway. I don't know how/why this happens but that was the straw that broke the camel's back and when I decided to write this review. I wish every stock plane had virtual cockpit. The 2d cockpits on the models in the app are awful. I really regret spending $60 on this. Wish I saved the money and bought some payware for FSX. While this app does have better graphics, you can get mods for FSX to make it more realistic. I don't like that you can't (or maybe I just don't know how) communicate with ATC. FSX you can communicate with ground, tower, center, etc. so every flight feels like you're really flying even though the tower sounds like the computer from Wargames. I also like in FSX how it's easy to use the autopilot and NAV radios. Makes it easy to tune into ILS.\n\nThe surroundings aren't that great either. Random buildings everywhere instead of actual landmark buildings. This definitely takes away from the realism of a sim.\n\nI spend all of my time on this app doing landings. That's one of the best things I've been doing with this app. Pick an airport, then it gives you 3 or 10 mile final. Loading times are a  pain in the butt and that's a shame. I'm on a 4790K and it still takes about a minute to go from "launch" on steam to getting to an airport.\n\nAnyway, If I were myself a couple of weeks ago (when I bought this app) I would advise myself not to buy it. I advise you not to buy it either. Spend the money you would have paid for this and buy some payware for FSX. Wish steam offered refunds because I would have done so about 2 hours after I started using this app.","August 25, 2014","false","12.0"," 23 of 48 people (48%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","48","23","48","3","0"

I'm very please to see it on steam now, so that we don't have to carry 8+ DVDs anymore.\n\nX-Plane 10 is what it says on the tin. An extremely realistic flight simulator. I comes with a complete high-res world scenery package and a descent collection of standard aircraft out of the box. Yet it's not a game that takes your hand and tells you what to do. It's a flight simulator that requires some commitment to get the most out of it. You'll literally learn how to fly along the way.\n\nLike with other flight simulators the real power lays in modification. There are tons of free custom airport sceneries out on the web, many of which are quite stunning. The same goes for planes. For a long time free resources dominated X-Plane, yet in recent years high quality payware Add-Ons of stunning quality emerged, so that even the most pampered Flight Simulator use finds very well made airliners, photorealistic sceneries and so on.\n\nMy setup consists of hundreds of custom airports, dozens of payware aircraft (mostly airliners) and a small array of tools like PFPX to do the flight planning. With that I conquer the world almost daily. For long flights I often chose the Flightfactor Boeing 777 while shorter hops are a lot of fun using one of Peters Aircraft A320 or A321 models. Looking for a realistic A380? No problem, there's one. More of a Boeing guy? Go forthe 747-8i then. Not into airliners at all? Have fun with the KingAir 200 or a Cessna Corvalis TT. Why not a Challenger 300 business jet for a change. Oh and there's the occasional flighter trip you can do for thrills at supersonic speeds. Too slow? Take the space shuttle for a few circles around the earth.\n\nMy point here is that X-Plane 10 is what you make of it. It's an open world, literally, that allows you to fly as close to the real thing as you can get.\n\nIt doesn't blow the budget on hardware (I run it with rather high setting on 500$ hardware!), yet doesn't have any limits to what it can take hardware wise as well. So whatever you throw at it, it will only look better.\n\nThe weather engine is quite detailed. Weather may be generated at random, drawn out on a map or finetuned. Want the real weather? Just download it and don't forget to check your weather radar (yes there's one!)\n\nAfter years of using X-Plane I never grew tired of it. If you're looking for a modern, realistic, extendable and smooth running flight simulator, X-Plane is a great choice and I can only recommend it. If you're unsure, check out the official website for the free demo. Check out the community, which provides a lot of useful information and creates new resources, most of them free, on a daily basis.\n\nSee you in the skies!","July 19, 2014","true","128.2"," 14 of 30 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","14","30","0","0"

Be prepared that many airports do not have a detailed scenery and you need to download further free scenery files to improve your experience.\n\nI recommend the X-Plane 10 flight simulator for enthusiasts that like to browse the web for addon scenery and aircraft.

I give this simulator 5 stars because of the in depth feeling and the community base of addons. Another great point about the steam version of X-Plane 10 is not having to put a CD into the drive or having to buy a dongle to let you play without the cd.\n\nSteam members who have not played any other types of flight simulators this simulator is realistic to the point and will take a lot of learning.

In order to set the flight route I had to goto some website to generate the flight route file, move the file into the route folder somewhere on my desktop, and then load the flight route file into the plane which took me ages because there was so many buttons. And for the ATC I just gave up on that lol. Since the major cities don't look like the real world cities, I recommend getting some city scenery from Ted's X-Plane scenery site (Its free!).","August 29, 2014","true","15.2"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

The only negative to this positive is that fact that a lot of the extra aircraft you look for to add on to the simulation you have to pay extra for which is down right rediculous in my opinion considering you pay a good $60 just for the base simulation itself. Also there are alot of "free" aircraft and scenery out there to download but it can be a very tedious pain in the rear to even download those for the simulation. 9/10","September 22, 2014","true","56.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I was so excited when a "modern-day" flight sim came along, at least not A military flight sim.\n\n1. Textures: Airports and cities have basically nothing besides a strip of tarmac and copy-paste of all of the buildings, which do not look great as is. I thought this would be normal for a game that has such an enourmous world size, but after comparing it to other sims this is definetly not the case. If you want a good-nice looking game out of box without having to download many types of freeware that are not compatible, this is definetly not the game for you.\n\n2. Mouse and keyboard: I currently play with a "CH Products Flight Sim Yoke" which works perfecttly well on most of my games on my mac(yes unfortunetly I do not have a gaming PC YET. But this is another reason I was limited to Xplane instead of FSX or other sims.) When I tried flying the stock cessna with a mouse and keyboard I apperently can fly like a blue angels pilot or have broken physics. The ability to make 60 degree turns with the slide of a mouse in under a second was insane and if you are looking for a game where you can do that, knock yourself out, but I am writing a review for a flight sim, not a game.\n\n3. No tutorials: Like I said, first flight sim. I had very little knowledge of how to use the given aircraft and had to go through many youtube tutorials to understand the basics of the sim. If we again compare this to FSX, we can see why this is an extreme downfall.\n\n4. Very Simple AI: The AI can do about 3 things\n1) take an hour to take off announcing 10 times that they are crossing a certain runway\n2)mimic your aircraft to simulate "formation flying" which responds the exact second you do and looks like a copy-paste onto the screen.\n3) attempt to land\n\n5. very confusing control tower clearences and controls: Control towers are extreamy hard to find and when you do they are rather difficult to understand given that there are no tutorials. I understand that this isn't a sim that is ment to teach you everything about flying, but not being to understand any of the commands coming up to takeoff given by the control tower becomes annoying.\n\n\nWhat needs to happen for this sim to be "fixed"\n1. Include many new textures of the land, airports, and surrounding cities FOR FREE, I paid $60.00 for this, I mean come on!\n2.Realistic mouse controls\n3.Tutorials on just the basics. Takeoff and tower communication. Preflight checks, actual takeoff, radar control, auto pilot, etc.\n4.AI that respond well with control towers and edited to quite an extent\n5. Have a control tower at each major airport and use tutorials to enable everyone to communicate and understand orders and information well.","July 20, 2015","false","53.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","3"

It can be played like one, I personally like taking up an F14 and flying from wales to Scotland as fast as I can, or racing halfway round the planet in an SR71, while listening to my favorite music on spotify.\n\nThis is a SIMULATOR.  if you can do it in x-plane, it is possible in real life and the inverse applies.  The torque on a single prop craft will pull you to one side, meaning you have to trim the plane to get it to fly straight.

Dont get me started on 3D-cockpits, the detail on it, and oh damn, will you be dissapointed. The FSX's stock 747 cockpit destroys XP's. Don't even get me started with the modded 747 version on FSX.

The downside is, at least for those with slower internet connection, it will take you a week to install the globe. The core download, about 4 GB, will give a few quadrants around seattle. Next disappointment is the Airports themself. There are absolutely no buildings e.g. gates and towers etc. Just a runway or whatever the number of runways there are. I have seen someone saying, you can build or modify the airports yourself, all you need is bunch of more software and a good understanding of how it works. Wait a moment, we just paid $60 for an incomplete software licsense and if you want the whole thing, finish it yourself?\nThis sounds almost like, well let me have $60 and you can program it yourself?\nAway from the airports you'll see a richness of animated traffic and static objects, that I have to say. However, this is something if you only fly low altitude.\nWhat about the Jet liner? You'll take off and in no time you are at 10,000 feet, do I care what it looks like at 10000 feet? Absolutely not. When I land a jet, where do I do that? On the Airport e.g. runway.\nATC instructs me to taxi to gate 11 and I will have to reply, what gate? The one I don't see or the one I will have to build first?\nGive me a break, thats where things happen, at the airport, what do we see? Absolutely nothing aside the runway!\n\nI had X-plane installed several years ago on a LINUX box. The plane's where almost impossible to taxi and take off with. Seems like there was always a storm with crossewinds of some sort, couldn't get it right no matter what. With the latest release, it seems it's the same, as it was with the more than 10 years old version that I had on a LINUX box, only with some more traffic in areas that I don't even see from an Airport.\n\nI am sorry, this version smells awfully like a ripoff and will get thumbs down from me.\nIf I purchase software, I have absolutely no inclination to finish the product on my Computer. I want to explore and find out if it is worth to spend time to expand and enhance, but not finishing the software.\nX-plane 10 does not fulfill my expectation and will most likely wind up in the trash can.

If you buy DLCs its alright but if you play fsx you will most likely HATE this game like me. The graphics are extremely cool but even trying to learn how to play the game seems impossible! For this price its not worth it. I would honestly put this game for $15-20 because its so hard to play. For the people you see on Youtbe, they have been practicing for months. Another baf thing about it is that almost all addon aircraft don't have cockpits and the payware are so expensive. Another thing that is stupid is airports mostly are 2d and you must download airports for them to be 3d. Each airport takes about 40 seconds to install but most airports they don't even have or they only come in 2d.

Kills that one too.\n\nI have read past reviews were others seem inclined to attack anyone who rights a bad review.\n\nThe software is hard to use and offers poor instruction, have to feel your way through like a blind man.  It does not give a true sense of flying out of a controlled airport, when you can "choose" to ignor ATC.  The ability to easly use any instrument was lost with poor interface.  The ability to easly look around the flight deck was also missed, with poor instruction provided.   The programming was made to make money, if you leave the provided scenery area, you enter water world.  Don't worry, they provide a pop up in mid flight to inform you of this.  Again not too realistic, couldn't even write in default scenery.  I would give a better review if the "game" was set up to be more user friendly.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JEL248/recommended/292180/","JEL248","JEL","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JEL248/","7 products in account","I paid 60 US$ for X-Plane 10.3 in October 2014.\nIf Steam had a refund-button I would use it.\nI do NOT recommend X-Plane in its current state.\n\nIf this was the year 2002 X-Plane would be up to current standards, but this is 2014 and today you can find even free simulators that are better than X-Plane.\n\nIn fact, there is not much realism to be found in X-Plane (except that it's expensive, just like real flying)\n\nThe good:\n- The runways. They look good and fairly realistic when you're lined up for take-off at night. Seeing the lights on the sloped runway appears quite well-done.\n- The cars on the roads, at night, look pretty realistic (but taxes the system quite heavily, which basically makes it useless)\n\nThe bad:\nEverything else.\n\nA few examples:\n\n- The clouds look like nothing I've seen on planet Earth = unrealistic.\n\n- The cockpits are alpha-status. Gauges are missing and when they are there some of them doesn't actually work. For example; the heading-bug in the King-air (a default aircraft and not a 3rd party aircraft!) can't go from 350 degrees to 010 degrees unless you turn it counter-clockwise. The NAV1 Locator shows negative degrees (puts a minus in front of the degree number) if you turn it past 360 degrees counter-clockwise. Not even Flight-sim 98 by Microsoft was this buggy (and that was in 1997!)\n\n- The aircraft are not optimized for typical PC-joysticks, so the control of the aircraft does not compare to the same levels of work-load and stress-level that you feel in a real similar type. There also is no force-feedback (not even a simple stick-shaker or runway-rumble shaker which even FSX had in 2006) so you have no feeling for what the aircraft is doing in relation to ground or air-flow.\n\nI also want to mention the menus, although they're obviously not related to flight-realism. When you see the menus... you just can't help but feel it's a crazy person who made this sim. For example; if you want to turn the sloped runways off you get a pretty nutty pop-up text about how X-Plane is so much more 'awesome' (a word the X-Plane author seems to use a lot) than FSX because of these runways. A lot of the graphic-settings also has options such as 'Burn your CPU' or 'Too much' or 'Siberian winter'... it's really a joke to see something like this in a 60$, supposedly FAA-certified, simulator.\n\nSo, to sum it up, if you want realism from your flight-sim... X-Plane 10.3 is NOT the best choice in my opinion. It's more than 10 years behind current technology standards for home-PC flight-simulators.\n\nI do feel cheated paying 60 bucks for this incomplete software.","October 17, 2014","false","14.1"," 29 of 71 people (41%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","41","29","71","0","0"

On the X-Plane’s site, I find options to purchase X-Plane and the USB key… That is all; otherwise, I am just stuck with one skin for my plane. I absolutely LOVE the United 747 (but you’re just suck with that one 747 as an example)  =’(\n\nOkay, so firstly, the graphics, the actual physics of the plane (micro stuff), and the lack of lag are AMAZING (All the things FSX lacks). I have a decent gaming PC, and despite some patches of “not responding” during loading time, the game runs quite fluidly on very high-detail settings.\n\nHowever, the controls SUCK, the realism SUCKS, and I have yet to find the multi-player (if it exists). Many of the planes I have tried to fly are buggy, or just do not work at all. Like the space shuttle for example, it is not even running on the runway when it spawns, so I tried to add fuel, and it will not even let me do that. Some planes feel like they are loaded to capacity by bricks, meanwhile others are tossed around like toys by the controls. To be honest, I’m terrified that they train real pilots off this game. The controls are never precise and it feels like I’m flying the plane willy-nilly on my tablet.\n\nThe X-Plane (Liminar Research) folks need to get together with the Microsoft folks and they could make a TRULY AMAZING game! With X-Plane’s graphics and Microsoft’s UI + Realism, I’d be more than happy to pay a hefty sum for that game.\n\nThe user-interface in X-Plane is not user friendly at all. You have to clamor through a whole ton of menus with high hopes that you understand the geek-language and manually set your joystick buttons. I have a joystick, throttle quadrant, and a set of rudder-pedals. I had to manually program ALL the buttons and axes for the game. Personally, I was able to accomplish this part with slight stress, but I feel it would be almost impossible for the average person who is new to flight simulators.\n\nDuring flight, it is as if the game “forgets” some of my pre-programmed buttons and usually replaces it with something random. The “Lights” button becomes a “Pan-Left” button for example.\n\nAt the end of the day, it is as if the game just does whatever it wants. I was en-route to an airport and I wanted to check the map (to see where I was). BEWARE OF MIS-CLICKS!! I clicked “global map” instead of “local map” and all of a sudden, I was in a different aircraft at some RANDOM airport. There is no warning message for things like this, but tons of warning messages for the scenery that you have to spontaneously know how to download as DLC vs. coming with the game as it should. The redeeming quality is that the DLC comes free with the game, YAY.\n\nI am still new to X-Plane, but I have been playing flight simulators for over 10 years, and I "like" this game, but feel VERY disappointed by it!\n","July 15, 2014","false","7.8"," 48 of 129 people (37%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","37","48","129","0","13"

I already have payware aircraft for this game like the flight factor 777 & 757, but there are some good freeware aircraft out there.  The controls are decent, and it runs a lot faster, also, thank god there is no more "CD 1 required" when you run the game anymore, that ruined the gameplay....  This game is pretty pricey, but if you have an average computer and love great looking flight sims and don't mind the sound effects, you wll love this game... but FSX is more cheaper with better sound effects and aircraft if you want that alternative, but the FSX graphics aren't as good as XP10 in default...","August 5, 2015","true","36.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Landing and taking off seem more realistic than other known sims especially with the help of non-flat runways and great ground friction. Although I don't fly the included aircraft, I use the DLC or other payware planes because the quality of them makes the sim even better. There are plenty of third party add-ons for this sim.\n\nOne thing I do struggle with is the clouds, they aren't as pretty as you would hope, but flying through them feels really nice.\n\nThis sim uses "blade element theory" for flight dynamics which basically means airflow over the surfaces of the aircraft are simulated in a certain way. That also means with the included aircraft builder you can test out your own designs. This is not something I am into though, I just like to fly.\n\nI could say more but I'll keep it short, this is probably the best sim you can get in 64 bit too.\n\n","November 13, 2015","true","90.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

First off, I use a macbook, and I intended to find a flight simulator without using programs such as bootcamp (I used Flight Simulator X previously). And so I did what any sensible person would do, and searched Steam. And I found this little gem.\n\nNow this game has no-where near as good an interface as FSX, but both have a great modding community and very realistic and sensitive controls. The look of this game is better apart from the fact that it doesn't display cities as accurately as FSX, landmarks etc. it still has very good graphics and allows generation of animals on the ground which, though not interactive, scare the player when you're trying to take off and deer run on the runway. The buildings in FSX are crashable, in this game they are not, but considering that you're going to fly for most of the time, it doesn't really matter.\n\nMultiplayer capabilities are a bit worse than FSX, requiring port-forwarding and modem configuration to join the servers, but the servers you join are living breathing actual communites for actual flight with passengers, flight training, and what not, while on FSX people are genrally trying to recreate 9-11.\n\nThis game is a great alternative to FSX in more ways than one, and if you know how to reconfigure your modem, I recommend flying multiplayer on one of the many servers.","January 2","true","11.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, it really pays to have some experience with flight simming (or even real piloting), because this game is NOT novice-friendly. Unlike Microsoft Flight Simulator X, which has tutorial missions and a wealth of information in its Learning Center (including detailed information about how to fly its default aircraft), X-Plane basically throws you in the cockpit and says "best of British" to you. There are no tutorials, at least not within the game. It doesn't work all that well "out of the box", either. You have to spend some time configuring it (especially with regard to your controller). This is good in some ways, because X-Plane offers a lot of options for customisation and is very flexible in this regard. But in other ways, it's a bit tedious, especially as the user interface is not very user-friendly. Granted, there are plenty of forums where you can get good information, but it would be nice to have more of the information you really need within the game itself.\n\nThe scenery (minus any add-ons) is somewhat of a mixed bag. In terms of topography, X-Plane leaves FSX in the dust. The way in which hills, fields and so on are rendered is every bit as good as high-quality FSX scenery add-ons like Orbx or texture add-ons like REX. Water and lighting are also quite magnificent. Runways are (at least in my opinion) easier to see. Weather is very well done. However, where X-Plane trails a fair way behind FSX (and I think, Prepar3D) is in the way airports are depicted - often just bare runways and taxiways with no buildings at all. This is really very poor. Cities are not very well depicted either. While FSX default rendering of cities is pretty ordinary, it is still, at this time, vastly superior to X-Plane (again, I refer purely to default scenery - obviously, the scenery of both these flight sims can be improved with add-ons).\n\nAnother area where X-Plane falls short of FSX is AI aircraft. While it is nice to see real airlines (like United) instead of the generic airlines you get in FSX, the type of aircraft are often wrong for the airport. For instance, at my home airport (which is a major international airport, but has a fairly short runway), I saw a United Airlines Boeing 747. United doesn't fly to my city, and the runway is too short for 747s. Even more absurdly, I saw a NASA 747! Another crazy sight I saw was a Hercules (or something similar) doing all manner of weird somersaults before eventually righting itself and rolling down the runway for takeoff. AI aircraft in FSX aren't perfect, but they never do that! And the aircraft type is usually correct for the airport you're at. So this is another area of X-Plane that really needs some work.\n\nAs for your own aircraft, they have nice interiors and decent flight dynamics. More 2D pop-up panels would be helpful though (maybe add-ons provide these, but the default planes don't seem to, except for the Garmin GPS), and sometimes the instruments can be hard to read. Sure, you can zoom in on them, but then how are you supposed to see outside? Things like radios and the altimeter have be adjusted manually, but this is not too hard to do. Autopilots are a bit tricky. By the way, for looking around, I recommend using the mouse (zoom in and out with the scroll wheel, and hold down the right button to pan around). Much better than the keyboard. There's also your joystick's hat switch, but you have to manually configure this (X-Plane won't recognise your joystick the way FSX will), which is not that easy. By far and away the best way to look around, or zoom in and out, is with the mouse.\n\nOne thing I enjoy doing a lot in FSX is IFR flights between one place and another. It's very straightforward to create a flight plan in FSX. generate a navigation log and interact with ATC. You can do IFR flights in X-Plane as well, but it's far less straightforward (though I'm sure there are add-ons to make it easier). In FSX, you can search for a depature point by airport name, ICAO code or city. Likewise for your destination. But when filing a flight plan in X-Plane, you can only enter the ICAO codes for your departure and arrival points. I guess it's not too hard to look these up somewhere, but this is an example of how X-Plane is not friendly to newbies. Then too, you have to enter a route comprising VORs, DMEs or whatever (although you can leave this section blank and just fly direct, which is best for short flights). But it's not entirely clear how you should do this, what format it should take etc. There's no navigation log, which I love in FSX and really miss in X-Plane. Another thing to beware of is that X-Plane won't park your aircraft at a departure point the way FSX does. You have to choose your airport and gate/ramp BEFORE setting up a flight plan, and you will be returned to that same spot once you're done with your flight plan.\n\nInteracting with ATC takes a bit of getting used to in X-Plane. Whereas FSX will automatically tune you to your departure airport's Clearance Delivery frequency to get you started, you have to manually find the frequency in X-Plane. Better realism, granted, but it can be rather disconcerting at first. Actually, there is a rather handy trick that can help you with ATC in X-Plane. Go to the "Special" menu and select Toggle ATC (that's not exactly what it's called, but anyway it's about halfway down the Special drop-down menu). This brings up a little yellow box that you can use to "auto-tune" frequencies (select the "recommended" one). When ATC says something to you, make sure that you acknowledge their transmission or they'll just keep repeating themselves ad nauseam. Another thing X-Plane's ATC will do is tell you you're off course when you've just taken off and are flying the runway heading to gain a safe altitude, but are (temporarily) going in the opposite direction to your destination. This is quite annoying and I hope it will be fixed. Note also that ATC won't tell you to change course after you've taken off. They expect you to know where you're going (a novel concept). But when you are getting closer to your arrival airport, they will give you altitude and heading instructions that more closely resemble what the FSX ATC does. And I actually think the vectoring of X-Plane's ATC may be a little more precise.\n\nIf you are a complete and utter novice to flight simming, you would be better off starting with FSX or the upcoming Dovetail Games Flight School. Certainly in FSX, you can learn a LOT about the fundamentals of flying. X-Plane does not teach you these fundamentals and frankly throws you in the deep end. But if you DO understand the basics of flying (or indeed have reasonable experience with FSX and/or Prepar3D) and you can get the hang of X-Plane's interface (which is a learning curve in its own right), and if you can live with the weird AI aircraft behaviour and total lack of buildings at many airports, then X-Plane is well worth investing in, especially for its topography rendering, weather and aircraft flight dynamics. So I recommend it, albeit with a few caveats.","March 12","true","18.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have been flight siming for around  25 years and recently I have mostly been using Prepar3D. Prepar3D is a great product, but on my system it does not run smoothly (lots of stuttering) and the way it draws autogen one can see a visible pop-up boundary. These two issues really break emersion.\n\nAnyways I bought X-Plane 10 mainly out of curiosity. The first thing I noticed was how damn smooth it ran. For a laugh, I thought I'd max out the autogen stuff - trees, buildings and roads. I was expecting a slide-show, but what I got was a buttery smooth simulation.\n\nGiven what was being rendered I couldn't believe my eyes!\n\nA lot of people complain about the scenery being generic. This may well be the case, but it is so well implemented that it just looks and feels 'real'. It's the details of how the buldings and trees are created with regard to the road network. They actually look integrated. Add to that urban traffic that looks very believable and a draw distance that doesn't show any pop up and a buttery smooth frame-rate, then one gets a very immersive simulation.\n\nWith Prepar3d I know I'm in a sim because of all the issues I mentioned at the top of the post. But with X-Plane I really feel like I'm there. VFR flying in this sim is just a joy.\n\nMany complain about airport detail, but I have found no issues. I fly around the US Washington State area, where (so far) I have been able to download all the airports I need free of charge. As a bonus many of them look very good indeed.\n\nIs there anything I miss?\n\nWell yes. Lots of other air traffic and ATC, but I'm sure there are add ons out there that will address these two omissions!\n\nAs a flight simmer, I can't recomend X-Plane enough. I wish I had moved over sooner!","July 20, 2015","true","17.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The lack of some of the cool addons like FS2Crew and a decent ATC also grind a little, but the developers are starting to come to the party. Even PMDG is due to release a new study level aircraft for it this year.","May 14","true","142.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can literally lean to fly virtually any aircraft in your own home, at your own desk...simple incredible. Before I took a trip to China and Tibet I flew my XPlane sim into every airport, over every sight I was looking forward to being at. The 'Google Earth' quality of graphics made it so I actually recognized the places/runways/airstirps/mountains/streams/ topography as we flew over and landed.....absolutely incredible. Combine this program with CH Yoke, peddles and such and it's just like the real thing. After some time on my XPlane sim I am able to take over the controls of a friends Cherokee 6 (1,500 feet and above) and fly it like I was born behind the wind screen.....you can too....HIGHLY RECOMMENDED AAA++++","May 30","true","9.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

FSX looks dated (it is) and needs a significant cost investment to bring the ground textures up to some reasonable level. Still, no matter your system  performance will suck if you intend to crank up the textures. And HUGE ISSUE whether with FSX or Prepar3D is OOMs. Yes, the dreaded out of memory errors. Say goodbye to that with X-Plane at 64 bit.\n\nNow first big minus in XPlane - NO SEASONAL TEXTURES!. Go ahead, fly in Canada in winter. Look - summer textures,lol. So you'll need to get a program for this huge deficiency.\n\nThere is a growing body of payware for X-Plane and some fabulous planes such as the 777 and Flightfactor A350. Also the payware scenery, though nowhere near FSX/Prepar3D is starting to provide the necessary content to bring realism.\n\nUPDATE: Now updating my review. Giving thumbs up now because the first real attempt to provide a capable traffic AI - X-Life. The Deluxe version includes full ATC, flightplanning, follow-me car, etc. There is a growing body of airports which implements traffic AI through this program. Bravo. All of a sudden there is now a decent traffic program. Nowhere near Ultimate Traffic for P3D but well on its way.\n\nThere is also another decent ATC proram called pilot2ATC which is for XPlane and P3D.","February 26, 2015","true","522.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"
