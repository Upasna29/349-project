"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Imban/recommended/409670/","Imban","Imban","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Imban/","1581 products in account","Pink Hour is an amusing free platformer released as a "demo" of sorts for an upcoming game by the same developer, Kero Blaster. It provides a good half hour of fun, or ten minutes of fun followed by a half hour of ragequitting, depending on how good you are at platformers.\n\nHonestly, it's a pretty well put together platform/shooting game, with the biggest "drawback" being that it's fairly short - something that would be resolved by buying the game it's promoting, obviously. The only real issue I had was that Hard showed that it might have some issues with precision jumping, as I found myself falling short or overshooting on those segments reliably, which was annoying in this short level and would be more annoying if I had to do it constantly in Kero Blaster.\n\nThat said, though, it was a good half hour of fun for me, and free, so I can't really help but give this a thumbs-up.","October 28, 2015","true","0.6"," 27 of 33 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","27","33","2","3"

Also giving you guys a heads up that there some spoiler in this review.\n\nI have beaten this game 5 times, to make sure I have seen all the ending, as far as I can tell there only 3 ending in this game, there are two difficulty normal and hard mode, to unlock hard you have to beat it on normal at least once, I have to say it did get more difficult on hard mode, but it made it more fun, as well frustrating. I give this game 8/10.\n\nThe 1st ending is the same as for normal and hard mode if you lose the missing document after getting it, when Pink-Clad reach back to her office, she began to worry, on how to explain to her boss that she lost the missing document, so she went in, and explain herself, but her boss didn't get mad at her, because somehow her boss already has the missing document, and Pink-Clad became confuse when it got rip to shreds in front of her; Pink-Clad went back to her desk, later on her boss came out and drop a very large stack of work on Pink-Clad desk, and told her she has to finish all that by the end of the day, so Pink-Clad sign, started to work on the large stack of work that pile on her desk. The End.\n\nThe 2nd ending is for normal mode when you don't lose the missing document, when Pink=Clad finally get's back to the office, she was happy to found the missing document, and heads off to the boss office, she give her boss the missing document, and her boss ask Pink-Clad to order some office supplies, Pink-Clad, ask if she can put it on a note for her, Pink-Clad took the note from her, then Pink-Clad went back to her desk to make a call for the office supplies, when she was reading out the list, she also read the last part on the note, "Great work today -signed president-" Pink-Clad then said ignore the last part, then finisn making the order; Pink=Clad was happy because she get to go home on time today. Later on after Pink-Clad was leaving from work, she went to a video game store, to see if she can get a copy of Kero Blaster, the store clerk ask Pink-Clad "I didn't know you were into games." Pink-Clad reply "Oh no it's for my brother." so the store cleark asked what she was looking for, but when Pink-Clad ask for Kero Blaster he wasn't sure if he had a copy, so he show Pink-Clad few games if they were the game she speaks of, but Pink-Clad gave up, decided to check else where, but before Pink-Clad was about to leave the store clerk said "Wait, is this it?" Pink-Clad reply "YES! that the one" so the store clerk gave her Kero Blaster, and Pink-Clad went home. The End.\n\nThe 3rd ending is for hard mode when you don't lose the missing document, when Pink=Clad finally get's back to the office, she was happy to found the missing document, and heads off to the boss office, she give her boss the missing document, and her boss ask Pink-Clad to order some office supplies, Pink-Clad, ask if she can put it on a note for her, Pink-Clad took the note from her, then Pink-Clad went back to her desk to make a call for the office supplies, when she was reading out the list, she also read the last part on the note, "Great work today -signed president-" Pink-Clad then said ignore the last part, then finisn making the order; Pink=Clad was happy because she get to go home on time today. Later on Pink-Clad left work, but was teleport to somewhere unknow, and these two strange men are next to a strange machine, that seem to control the teleporter, the one man said you done great work, and there more to come, and thend Pink-Clad was teleport, showing the up in the clouds. - To Be continue - The End.\n\nCan't wait to give Kero Blaster a try, because it's the same people that made Cave Story.","October 31, 2015","true","0.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

The sound and art are amazing, at least in my opinion and both really tug at nostalgia. The game is very short, and acts as a demo for the upcoming game Kero Blaster. There is also a squeal for Pink Hour in the works called Pink Heaven.  The gameplay itself reminds me of a cross between Mega Man and Bubble Bobble if that makes any sense to anyone.\n\nTo top off this review, I should mention that these games are from the same dev behind Cave Story.

You play as an office worker who realizes her documents have been misplaced.... In a cave for some reason. A quick journey and a simple boss fight later, you either return to your office with the paper work, pleasing your boss (and getting to leave on time) OR if the document gets damaged, you have to work late.  :-(\n\nIt even has a cute epilogue, which can unlock a harder version of the cave with it's own ending.\n\nThe first time I played this game, my brain said "This feels like Cave Story". I hadn't realized this was also made by Daisuke Amaya AKA Pixel, who created Cave Story.\n\nSo if you enjoy side scroll platformers, give this a try.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/decibelle/recommended/409670/","decibelle","Kanaya Maryam (Trixie)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/decibelle/","177 products in account","Pink Hour is simple and short, and considering that it's free, it's worth at least checking out. It's a typical 2D platformer. You can shoot and move and dodge obstacles and all that. The story is pretty silly, but cute. You play as Pink, an office worker, who must obtain a document for her boss in one piece. It's located underground, for some reason, and she can blast enemies, somehow. You gotta roll with it.\n\nThe difficulty is pretty simple, so it's not a particularly stressful endeavor, and a fair amount of people are going to beat this on their first go. The graphics are simple and pixelated, and not particularly bad, though not the neatest looking either. There's only one boss fight, but funnily enough, you can skip it if you jump far enough and at the right time to go over its head. There's two different endings you can get here; one for bringing the document back, and one for beating the game without it (if you get damaged, for example). The ending for beating it with the document gives you a short cutscene, leading to the store page for Kero Blaster, which is a nice way to promote your game (since this is an advertisement for the game, after all).\n\nThere's a hard mode you can unlock if you beat the game, which extends its replayability just a little bit. Because I'm not the best at video games, this took me a lot longer than it probably should have, but it's still pretty beatable in under an hour. What makes the mode so hard is that Pink (the character you control) tends to float when she jumps, which can make it easy to over or underaim when you jump. This isn't bad in the regular mode, but in hard mode, some platforms are only barely big enough to where you have to jump perfectly. I'm not particularly a fan of the "perfect jump" difficulty in games, so a good portion of the hard mode wasn't too fun, and the second-to-last screen right after the boss fight took up maybe the most time on my hard mode attempts. However, once you figure it out, you'll be able to get the rhythm down and blow through it pretty fast. There's an ending to unlock here if you beat it with the document, leading into either Kero Blaster or Pink Heaven.\n\nThe game is fun for the short amount of time it offers, and while I'm not a fan of the jumping, the game isn't punishing and doesn't want to be arbitrarily hard. It's a nice relaxing time overall. Also, it's free, so there's no stress over cost per playtime. The one downside for some people may be that there are no achievements or trading cards, but this isn't a loss in my book, considering how straightforward the game is. Give it a go!","October 28, 2015","true","0.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kingsigy/recommended/409670/","kingsigy","KingSigy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kingsigy/","526 products in account","Pink Hour can be beaten in about 8 minutes, so there is no need to ramble on with a long review. It acts as a demo to Studio Pixel's "Kero Blaster." That game is a follow-up to the 2004 hit "Cave Story" by Daisuke Pixel.\n\nThis is, essentially, a really quick level that gets you to grips with the controls. You jump and shoot. You can shoot up and once shooting, you can move backwards without changing aim. What makes this demo worth playing a few times are the unlockables.\n\nIn addition to an alternate ending, there is also a hard mode. Beating that sets up where Pink ends up in her own sequel, "Pink Heaven." That is coming to Steam within a week, as well.\n\nThe game plays smoothly and offers some great incentives for dedicated gamers. It may not be excruciatingly difficult or life affirming, but the game is nice, short and sweet. That it's free is pretty much a "why not?"\n\nJust give it a try. If you don't like it, so be it.\n\n8/10","October 28, 2015","true","0.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/techbane/recommended/409670/","techbane","Techbane","http://steamcommunity.com/id/techbane/","875 products in account","I'm kind of torn on this one. I originally played the first release of this, which only came in the Hard Mode flavor; meaning that the game you start with now is actually severely toned down in difficulty from what it originally was. And toned down, it's a cute, serviceable little preview romp for Kero Blaster. I'd recommend it, sure.\n\nThe problem is that the formerly mandated Hard Mode (which you can still unlock by beating this on easy) is absolute screaming ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on toast. It's an agonizingly precision-based platformer over a series of instant death pits with Ninja Gaiden style bats flying in your face, and a player character that controls with ten times more inertia than is appropriate for this setup. I cannot make it past the first screen. This having been my first impression when it came out, it absolutely DESTROYED any and all interest I had in trying Kero Blaster, which I was previously reasonably hyped for. The lives system only makes it even worse.\n\nSo, go ahead and try it I guess, but don't expect anything good to come of Hard Mode.","December 20, 2015","true","0.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The full game promises a lot more content, so if you liked this, you should give Kero Blaster a try.","November 12, 2015","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you die, it's because you ♥♥♥♥ed up, and still is very easy to die.\nmechanics: are there even any? It's just run and gun; not quite Mega Man, but still very solid.\nbranching paths and different endings: choose well.\ngreat story: fantastical yes, but still very good.\n\nAnd when they said hard mode... oh boy, it was hard.\n\nIf this game has any cons at all, it would be that it is way too damn short, but it's free.

It's no "must play", certainly, but it isn't half bad either. It's short and very feature restricted (compared to the trailer of Kero Blaster), but it seems it conveys what you'd be getting yourself into with the Kero Blaster, in terms of gameplay and controls. Speaking of which: the jumping seems a little inprecise at times, other than that I can see no problem with it.","January 2","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
