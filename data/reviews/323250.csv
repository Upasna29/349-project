"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DaddyFunktastic/recommended/323250/","DaddyFunktastic","DaddyFunktastic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DaddyFunktastic/","2029 products in account","My first impressions on the game:\n\nThe main game style is presented on a hex board, where you move tokens individually to create chains of 6 or more with the task for each level to clear a set amount of the various tokens. If you dont create a match on a turn more tokens are randomly added to the board. It's a very interesting take on the match gems style game, but there doesn't seem to be a time limit, and there's no limit to the number of moves. You just have to keep making matches and not let the board get too overrun and eventually you'll finish the level. This is pretty much the main issue with the game, its just way too easy.\n\nIn between the puzzles you build your city with houses/farms etc providing revenue in the form of money or special tokens which can be used during the main game. The problem with this is that due to the game being easy it feels like this whole aspect is rather pointless as it feels like you don't need any of it. Money is mainly just used to buy more buildings and clothing for your Pharaoh/Queen avatar, which doesn't seem to change how the levels are played, it's just for aesthetics.\n\nThere are a few other casual game types including a Clickr style matching puzzle, hidden object, pairs memory and a nice take on spot the difference, but again these are hampered by no time or click limit and the fact you have the option to skip them entirely.\n\nWhat's here is fun and relaxing with some nice variety, and I do recommend it for fans of these types of games or kids, but anyone looking for a challenge should look elsewhere.","September 19, 2014","true","1.3"," 22 of 26 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","22","26","0","0"

The gameplay is original and the later levels really demand to think ahead your moves. It still isn't stressing, as there isn't any time limit. The town you build is really beautiful and has an effect on bonuses you earn at each level. And you'll earn many items for your avatar, which can be really pretty. It's really worth the price !","January 21, 2015","true","14.7"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

The base game is your typical Bejeweled style game where you must connect chains of 6 like color blocks. There are various objectives in each level to complete which is a refreshing challenge. Once you complete the levels you earn rewards and currency for town or character upgrades.\n\nThis currency is mainly used to build and create a town. You can choose what and where you build or select the auto-build feature to get back to the actual game. Your overall objective is to collect the 10 Ancient Egyptian artifacts over 120 challenging but fun levels.\n\nThe game also offers added challenges as if it didn't have enough going for it; these bonus stages include Photo Hunt, Mahjong, Jigsaw puzzles and more! I really enjoyed the variety and depth of this casual offering!\n\nThis game is worth the $5; a casual game that everyone should grab if on sale!\n\nAccidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful?

It's not going to blow anyone's mind, but it's very low-pressure and relaxing.  The color-matching puzzles, which make up the bulk of the gameplay, start out very easy, then require persistence in the higher levels.  There are also hidden-object scenes, spot the difference, jigsaw puzzles, and tile-matching interludes, in addition to a little dress-up game and some minor city-building (which the game will do for you automatically until you have all the important buildings).  Good game for passing time while you do other things, or for people who prefer ultra-casual games.","April 30, 2015","true","200.3"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/randsec/recommended/323250/","randsec","RandSec","http://steamcommunity.com/id/randsec/","336 products in account","A non-violent game, consisting of several different mini-games, usually based on 6 adjacent colored balls on different boards which can change while playing.  Another mini-game releases coins by matching colors down, and there are Mah-Jhong and jigsaw puzzles.  The player selects a character, gender, facial and body characteristics and dress.  Over time, the player builds a town, unfortunately fairly small, and gets rent, which can be applied to other clothing items.  Overall, the game takes a long time, but one can easily quit and come back later.  My wife and I spent 32 hours together and enjoyed the time.  There are a couple of different bonus mini-games we could play, and we might just start all over someday.  Recommended for turn-based board-style gaming and accessorizing the character.","August 14, 2015","true","32.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You havea  little city to build and upgrade to produce the powerups for use in the main game but I'd maxed out all of them for about 30-40 lvs before I needed to touch them... which makes caring about the city very pointless. Equally being able to dress your avatar is equally pointless as the only time you ever see that avatar is on the 'dress' screen.\n\nOverall I'd say Hexus is a nice idea that nearly works but just doesn't quick click together. Might be worth picking up cheap in a sale but finding flash games on the internet is probably going to be more rewarding.","May 9, 2015","false","7.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The puzzles aren't too complex, so if you're looking for a massive challenge, look elsewhere.  Nice little friendly game that has a bit of variation in the puzzles, so far I've come accross 6 different types I think, might have been 7.....\n\nThere are some fairly blatant spelling errors, so if this is going to break the game for you, avoid, but this is the only major flaw in this game.","November 26, 2015","true","25.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For the most part, you're going to be ferrying colored gems around to make/clear sets of six (or more); and the game does well with expanding on the core theme with a variety of game mechanics.\n\nThere's also a management sim (city-building) side, but it seems like that part of the game was either bolted on at the end or abandoned as an idea and just finished enough to get it working; you can successfully navigate pretty much the entire management aspect by clicking "auto-build" when prompted.  Let me be absolutely clear about something: this is not a complaint.  I am a puzzle gamer, and I very much appreciated the way that side was approached: seeing the city grow up was a neat little diversion, and fun to look at, but I definitely would have seen it as "in the way" if I'd had to devote any significant time to managing it.  I did spend a little time rearranging the location of the fountain and getting the distribution of shoreline trees just right (Giant pine trees right next to the shoreline?  Don't tell me how to run my city!), but knowing I could drop that aspect at any time and get back to the puzzles was very important.  I will say the screenshot of the city-building seems to contain buildings that aren't in the game, but maybe I just didn't encounter them; I did try to build things out a bit, but management games are very much not my thing so it's not outside the realm of possibility that I glossed over something.\n\nIn addition to the core gameplay, there's also a pretty good variety of mini-games.  The first five are hidden object (find a list of things and click on them), spot the difference (two similar pictures, drag misplaced objects around in the second picture to make it match the first), memory (flip over and match pairs of tiles), Mahjongg (with a couple of extra colored tiles to make things easier) and "quest", which is where you have a grid of colored dots and click on connected dots of the same color to remove them and cause special items to fall down; seems like it's been done before but I'm drawing a blank.  This last mini-game is treated as a full alternate campaign item, although I'm not sure why.\n\nThe last of the mini-games deserves its own paragraph, and quite frankly I think it could easily stand as its own game with a little polish, ala Pixel Puzzles: Japan.  It's just assembling a jigsaw puzzle, so in that sense there's nothing new; what's novel here is that for most of them, you're assembling two (or, in one case, three) puzzles from the same pool of pieces.  That was super cool, and while the UI for solving the puzzle felt cramped (especially for the three-way one) it was a great idea and I'd love to see it fleshed out (but not to look like Pixel Puzzles, though...their UI is cramped too and don't even get me started on that stupid koi pond piece pool).\n\nQuick pro tip about the mini-games (except "Quest", which is handled differently and appears on the main world view screen): you can't come back to one if you skip/dismiss it.\n\nFrom a difficulty standpoint, fans of challenge are going to be disappointed, I think.  Like with the "token-ness" of the management sim aspect, this wasn't a problem for me personally (I don't mind a nice, leisurely stroll through a game), but if you're looking for the puzzle gaming equivalent of "punishing NES-era difficulty" then this game may not be for you.  While the gameplay was interesting and varied, when it comes to difficulty I'd say the first 90 levels are basically training for (some of) the last 10.  There are a few levels in the very late game (like I said, levels 90-100) that were legitimately hard and I pulled them out by the skin of my teeth even after using all the special items I could.  As is the danger with any game that relies heavily on a random factor, a lot of the difficulty did seem to be arbitrary (new gems just happened to appear in the exact spot required to block what I was trying to do, sometimes in entire sets); that said, even then I never actually had to attempt a level more than once (I did fail a level once, but that because I was experimenting with something).  The mini-games are literally impossible to fail; if you don't click the right thing based on whichever game it is, the biggest penalty you'll get is a buzzing sound and/or less bonus money when (not if) you complete it.  The Mahjongg board will even reshuffle its tiles for you if you run out of moves.\n\nOne downside (not for me, but I know this is important to a lot of people so I'm including it) is that there is no post-campaign content...at all.  When you complete the campaign, you're taken back to the main menu and all your progress is erased, save for a (partial) screenshot of your city build in the "Throne Room".  If you click on "Start Game", instead of getting the "continue or start over" choice like you would if you had a campaign going, the campaign just starts fresh as if you were launching for the first time.  I know, I was really surprised too.  Completionists will probably hate this because there's no opportunity to leisurely go through and experiment with different city builds, buy all the cosmetics (clothing options, etc.), or -- most importantly in my book -- replay arbitrary levels.  Maybe you'd call it shooting fish in a barrel, but I think I'd have gotten a kick out of going back and pwning the first level with all those maxed-out level 100 bonus spells.  Ah well, no dice on that.\n\nFrom an audio standpoint, the music fit the game well.  One thing I look for in a puzzle game's music is that it not distract from the gameplay, which is to say my ability to concentrate; Hexus does not disappoint in that regard.  I particularly liked the ambient background during the hidden object mini-games (or maybe that's just the only time I noticed it), but then I've always been partial to that whole monks-chanting-in-a-cathedral thing.  Reminded me of "Virgo Serena" from The Talos Principle (the title music) a little, which is no small compliment.\n\nIf you like this game, check out...
