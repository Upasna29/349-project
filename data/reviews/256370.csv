It offers a great sense of realism and really challenges your abilities while still being great for any beginner.  Not that I need to mention it, but the graphics are quite amazing as well.  Sounds are okay.  They aren't the best in the world, but they will do.  The career mode is fairly in depth and you can tweak just about every setting on your bike which is very nice.\n\nThe only issue I am experiencing right now is the sound cutting off about 30 minutes in causing me to restart the game (onboard Realtek 7.1).  I experienced the same bug in the demo.  I still definitely recommend the game for any enthusiastic racer.\n\nUPDATE1:  There is one thing that absolutely BUGS me about this game and it totally kills the realism for me.  Devs, if you are reading this, please for the love of God FIX THE START GATE!  This whole "ready, steady, start" crap is so annoying.  You guys just need to make it where you get the 30 second warning board turned sideways and just drop the gate randomly (2-10 seconds) and if you go too soon you get stuck at the gate.  This is not a game killer for me, but for a game that is striving for realism, I can't believe you guys could mess this up.\n\nAlso, a possible workaround for the sound bug for me seems to be changing the "voices number" to 32 instead of 64.  So far it is working, I'll update this review if I discover that it didn't fix it.\n\nUPDATE2:  Changing the "voices number" did not fix the problem.","March 28, 2014","true","34.0"," 97 of 115 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","97","115","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/break71/recommended/256370/","break71","Break","http://steamcommunity.com/id/break71/","222 products in account","Coming from a pretty seasoned MX Sim & MX VS ATV player & experienced MX rider I thought I'd give my 2 cents.\n\nPRO's:\n\nReal sponsors & bikes.\nReal tracks.\nReal riders.\nTrack deformation.\nCornering feels great. Sliding it into a tight turn and powering out feels better than any other mx game out there.\nThrottle control. Again, using throttle control to kick the back end out is wonderful.\nFirst person actually looks & feels good.\nActually needing to brake.\nThe game looks nice...just about. Bike models look amazing, well done.\nPretty in depth career mode, & 1st one for a long time.\nCustomisation of the bike settings before a race is great.\nPractice/Qualifying formats.\nAnd finally well done Milestone for a simultaneous PC release!\n\nCON's\n\nPhysics in the air feel awful & clunky.\nReady Steady Go start format? Is this Mario Kart? Should just drop the gate & the clutch...(see next point).\nTheres no clutch!!??? Massive negative here.....\nWhy can't I control the whip/scrub? Don't animate such an important feature!! Doesn't feel fluid or natural.\nTrack deformation doesn't make a difference to handling.\nRuts and berms don't feel supportive & I feel like cross rutting isn't an issue, even late in a race.\nSpin outs and wheelies can feel random at times.\nNo rev sound on the start gate & in the air?? Get that stuff recorded and implement it!! Basic stuff there...\nRear brake & panic rev doesn't do much in the air.\nWhy make 250F's unable to clear most jumps? They're pretty much as fast as a 450F irl, sometimes out qualifying them.\n\nSummary.\n\nTo be fair, on the ground at least MXGP feels great. Cornering is good, feedback feels great, the rider positioning and animations are spot on and you can make this engine look good once you have got it down. But the clunky whip/scrub feature and the lack of rev sounds brings you literally crashing back down to earth with a bang.\n\nThe career mode is deep and rewarding, although I get the impression a few things could have been pushed a little more. I guess not being able to choose which clothing brand I wear is due to clothing being tied to some teams & manufacturers with it being official sponsors and all. But it just feels like some design choices could have been implemented a little better.\n\nI love mx games, and will buy them regardless to support the industry. We need developers to keep making these games so it pushes them further. If Milestone release an MXGP 2, or MXGP 2015 or whatever its called, I think it will be great, but this one just falls short of a great title.\n\n5.5/10 imho.","March 30, 2014","true","33.3"," 54 of 61 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","54","61","0","3"

It can be a mild arcade racer for those of you that just want a fun moto game, while the vets and fans of real riding will love the Sim aspect of the game once you put the difficulty and assists to realistic. The game is pretty much MX Sim with better graphics than alive and the dual stick controls we love from reflex. The career is very realistic and has timed practice as well as qualifying with every race on the career, then like real Motocross you will do a moto 1 and moto 2 to see who gets the points for the weekend. The AI will keep you on the edge until the checkered flag, you never know when someone is going to scrub past you or show a wheel in a turn. Real racers, real tracks, real sponsors, real everything.

In MXGP you start your career as a wildcard and work your way through MX2 and MX1 championships until you can rise to the top of the leaderboard. As you get better and perform well through the season you'll get offers from better teams and you'll have a much wider selection than the handful of teams you can pick as a wildcard.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheCapulet/recommended/256370/","TheCapulet","*TÃ¸R*TheCapulet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheCapulet/","225 products in account","Preface: I come from a deep motocross background\n\nAfter playing this game for a few days, I can, without a doubt, say that this game is the most realistic motocross game out right now.  Unfortunately the bar isn't set very high, considering the only competition to this game is previous titles from the same developer.\n\nDespite how realistic everyone says the rider physics are, how authentic everyone says the track and bike physics are, and despite the fact that they (the devs) call this game a "simulator" in the opening credits, the idea that this game represents a realistic take on motocross is laughable at it's very best.\n\nEvery single AI rider will attempt to scrub seemingly every small bump they ride up to, no matter how much time they lose wobbling off a small jump that didn't require them to scrub any speed at all.  If you hit a rider, expect him to stay upright while you go flying.  If another rider hits you, expect him to stay upright while you go flying.  If you hit the yellow dirt, rather than the brown dirt, expect to get thrown off your bike.  How depends on the angle you approach the white dirt at speed.  But as soon as you hit it, you either start floating while flailing your arms while your bike sinks into the ground, or you literally fall right through the bike and start ragdolling all over the place.  It's just infuriatingly stupid.\n\nThe very last race I ran, a rider came down on top of my bike and literally rode a third of a lap on top of my helmet.  When he finally dismounted... I crashed.  He didn't.  I mean, FFS?\n\nAlso, "career mode" is nothing more than a continuous championship mode with the choice of bike livery between seasons.  There's no depth or fun.  You don't feel like you're building or contributing to anything.  You just simply race, go back to the silly appartment, rinse and repeat.  Oh, but you can pick your helmet (I'm rolling my eyes).\n\nWant to know what pisses me off even more?  The fact that they force you to use mouse and keyboard in menus unless you want to guess which buttons do what.  For a game that is a true to life â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ console port, you'd think they'd at least have some decent controller setup and support.\n\nAnd multiplayer... â¥â¥â¥â¥ing multiplayer.  I can't comment on it because it just plain doesn't work.  I've created an account, I've activated it via email, and even visted their website using it.  But any time I click on multiplayer, it tells me I need an activated account to play.\n\nThe one redeaming quality this game has is that it's track deformation isn't matched in any game, any genre, anywhere.  (And... I take this back.  SpinTires puts it to absolute shame.  VBS2.5 also does better, though I couldn't call it a game.)  There are more fun racing games.  There are more fun motocross games, for that matter.  There are certainly more realistic racing games, even with bikes, despite the unfortunate fact that there are no MX game competitors.\n\nDo I reccomend this game?  Only if you REALLY REALLY REALLY need to ride a dirt bike in a game.  Otherwise, spend your money on something less half-baked.\n\nPS: the graphics don't look nearly as good as the screenies.  The graphics suck.  Expect terrain LOD popping at all times as well.","December 1, 2014","false","10.1"," 89 of 130 people (68%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","68","89","130","6","4"

So let's discuss why with...\n\nThe Bad\n-No tricks?\n-No real in-depth customization\n-Not much variety and tons of game padding\n\nOne of the reasons why I loved games such as the MX vs ATV series was doing all the fantastic tricks that you could pull off, sadly MXGP features none of that.\n\nThe most trick related thing you'll even be doing in MXGP is whipping or scrubbing your bike to aim for a better landing in between slopes,  as I said previously MXGP aims for a more grounded and racing focused experience, which I guess is what the actual MXGP competition is, but none the less I was kinda disappointed by this.\n\nNext up the game doesn't offer much in customization, when you're creating your character you basically pick a pre-created display picture for him who's probably just random developer, select a nationality, make a name, and pick a number...\n\nThat's really about it, but then again character customization in a racing game isn't a huge deal obviously, but this also extends to your bike as well, outside of adjusting the control assists or your bikes technical aspects, you have no real aesthetic customization to your bike itself which is also pretty disappointing.\n\nBut probably my biggest issue is the massive amounts of padding in the career mode itself, you basically go to your calender, select your next race, set up your settings, you can do a practice run to wrap your head around the track, then you can do qualifying race, all of this you can skip of course.\n\nThen you finally race.... Then you race again... Maybe this is how it works in the actual MXGP but by the time you've done all this you've basically raced this same track a good 4 times and spent a good 15 to 20 minutes with it.\nThen you come back to your garage-thing, read your email for potential teams or sponsors, and read your twitter thing.\nThen you select your next race event and do it all over again.\n\nBy the end of it all after racing every event, the game then just simply tells you to do it all over again but with a different class of bikes and slightly improved AI, the exact same tracks, in the exact same order.\nTo which I just simply responded âNoâ after having already sunk 8 hours or so into this game.\n\nBut now let's discuss,\n\nThe Ugly\n-Looks bland, nothing really impressive\n-Muddy tracks being torn up as you race is kinda cool\n-Locked at 30fps\n-Clipping issues, bugs, and crashes\n-No licensed music or soundtrack while racing\n-Over all presentation is somewhat bland\n\n\nWhere we discuss the graphics, technical aspects, soundtrack, and general presentation of the game.\n\nOver all MXGP is fairly bland looking considering this is a 2014 release and doesn't offer much in the way  of visuals nor will it be any bit taxing on your system by any means, the tracks themselves are based on real world locations and look decent enough and the track itself having the dirt torn up by bikes as you race is pretty neat to see.\n\nHowever what's not so neat to see was my frame rate counter being locked at 30, I don't see any valid reason for a racing game of all things to be locked at 30fps, especially on PC.\n\n\nThe game also suffers from some clipping issues as you fall from your bike the odd time, as well as some other bugs and the odd rare crash I had happen once or twice during my 8 or so hours with it.\n\nAs for the soundtrack side of things, the game is completely devoid of any licensed music or soundtrack outside of the main menu music which is generic guitar stuff, so as your racing you'll basically just hear the wonderful sounds of dirt-bike engines.\n\nAnd all over the presentation for MXGP is just extremely bland, everything from the lifeless career mode and fake twitter social media thing, to the lack of music as you race, the only thing that even stood out to me was the massive amounts of in-game Monster Energy advertisements.\n\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nOver all MXGP certainly feels like a budget title and doesn't do much to convince you otherwise.\nIt's a competent racing game with nice mechanics going for it but it doesn't do much in the way to stand out from the rest and I still ONLY recommend if it if you're big into MX racing or off-road racing games in general.","October 14, 2015","true","12.9"," 33 of 40 people (83%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","83","33","40","5","3"

MXGP is not a game where you pull off insane tricks or jump off giant cliffs. MXGP is a recreation of real MX racing and it does this fairly well.\n\nPros:\n\n+ There are multiple game types - Instant race, Grand Prix, Championship season, Career Mode and Time attack. It has  recreated tracks from real tracks on the MX tour. The tracks also have track deformation of the dirt and mud. There seams to be a lot of tracks as well. I'm not real far into it but the season I'm in has at least a dozen to complete.\n\n+ Multiple difficulties that can be tweaked to make MXGP as easy/arcade or Hard/Simulation as you prefer.\n\n+ The physics and handling of the motorcycles are done very well. No other MX game has gotten this close to the feeling of riding a real MX bike. (yes I have ridden on real MX bikes and street bikes as well)\n\n+The replays look good and have multiple options like slow motion, pause and a free cam. You can get some nice screenshots.\n\n+ Graphics are solid. The riders and the bikes look good and gather dirt and mud on them during the race. The tracks are pretty good too but could have been done better. I use SweetFX on this game and it makes it look better.\n\n+You can remap the controls on the controller. I recommend you use a controller. I don't know of any racing game that work well with mouse and keyboard. At least not for me. I recommend that you change the lean forward and backwards to the same stick as steering left and right. It feels much more natural this way.\n\n+You level up, unlock pictures, gear, bikes ect and you get more fans the better you do in each race. Also there is a simulated email and twitter type media in the game that makes tyou feel you are being watched by teams, fans and your manager. It's a nice touch to give a sense of progression and connection in the game.\n\nCons:\n\n- The presentation is pretty bad. In between races I've had my bike disappear in the pits. The pit crew guy is working on an imaginary, invisible bike. Also before a race, during the intro scene, my rider was shaking around like he was have convultions. The pit crew and girl who holds the starting card all look and act like zombies. Why even put these in the game ?  Also, Some of the ground during races has pop in and loads textures too. The game needs a patch to fix these things.\n\n- The sound is not very good either. The bikes just sound weak, why can't developers get this right ? Even if it's not realistic they need to alter the engine sounds to make them more rich and intense. Also, There is no option to play music during races, it would be nice to have. I noticed there is barely any sounds of the stadium surroundings happening. It would be great to have the crowd react to what is happening. Cheer when you overtake or respond to a big wreck. Make the game and the race feel exciting Milestone ! Enough with the barebones, boring presentation already !\n\nAlso a track announcer being heard over the PA system would add some immersion. Having your pit crew tell you your doing great or you have 1 lap to go would really add some interaction to the game. These things could have be easily added into the game and would make the game better. On my PC the sound cuts in and out during start videos but no real problem in game so far. I've seen that many people have had problems in game though. Patch these things into the game Milestone.\n\n\n\nOverall the game just feels kind of bland. This happed in other games by Milestone. I loved the racing and handling in MotoGP 08 but it has the same barebones presentaion and sound as well. Milestone get the racing right, and that is what is most important, but they need to add some flavor and style into these games. As for now I will enjoy MXGP for what it is but there is definately room for improvement.","July 21, 2015","true","7.7"," 22 of 23 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","22","23","0","0"

I raced motocross and did my fair share of freestyle and enduro for close to 12 years so I know a thing or 2 about motocross.  That being said it's been a good decade since my glory days with my 2003 CR250R and video games is about as close as I can get to my favorite past time without winning the lottery so finding this game was a real treat, and very nice alternative to the super fun, but dated mx reflex.   Anyway, the game handles and looks great IMO, im not a fan of the GP circuit but since this is the most authentic motocross game I'll take what I can get, and while I don't think a freestyle(tricks) mode is needed in a sim racer like this, i do wish it had a free ride mode(big jumps and whips).  Like say a big open playground in Glamis Sand Dunes.  That would have been the icing on the cake.  They decided to go the racing only route and thats cool and all because they really focused on that one thing and really spit shined it.  After playing this game im really hoping for a next gen sequel with a bit more content like free ride, enduro, and freestyle because I have really come to like the more weighted feel of the bike handling.  Maybe im looking through rose shaded glasses but it really does feel quite authentic when it comes to the handling.

While far from perfect, MXGP tries to aim for a slightly more realistic approach to MX racing via realistic cornering and braking physics, but falls short with poor jumping physics and poor bike sounds. A CONTROLLER IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!\n\nPros:\n\n+ 14 Real world tracks to choose from\n\n+ Realistic cornering and braking\n\n+ Authentic racing experience (Real tracks, bikes, teams and riders)\n\n+ Good graphics\n\n+ Bike tuning (though somewhat limited in terms of options) actually affects the way bikes behave\n\n+ Decent AI (15 AI riders supported in offline play)\n\n+ Intense multiplayer races see players banging bars as they fight for the perfect lines (12 players supported)\n\n+ Mo-capped rider animations look awesome\n\n+ Realistic helmet cam view (if that's your kind of thing)\n\nCons:\n\n- Horrible bike sounds (what is this, Excitebike?)\n\n- Poor jumping physics (lack of mid-air control/no gas gyro effects)\n\n- Scrubbing seems rather mechanical and automated (players are only required to push both sticks in the same direction near the lip/takeoff of a jump which requires no real skill and uses the same animation over and over)\n\n- Track deformation is mostly cosmetic (players cannot physically ride in ruts formed on the track)\n[*edit* after 5+ laps, corners are harder to take due to braking ruts/bumps forming, however bikes ride 'on top' of the dirt as opposed to 'in it' thus resulting in mounds forming in corners as opposed to ruts which players can ride in for better traction.]\n\n- Relatively steep price (although not gameplay related)\n\n\nStill highly recommend picking this game up as it breathes fresh air into the MX racing genre, providing countless hours of fun on tracks which are easy to learn but hard to master (and pays off if you do). The game has good AI for those who wish to play offline, but online play is where this game truly shines. Despite the games efforts of providing an authentic MXGP experience, a track editor would have been a nice touch.\n\nTL;DR\nGreat MX game which is a step in the right direction, with room for improvement.

The developers are definitely on the right track with this game. This is the most realistic motocross game ever.\n\nHowever..\n\n1. This is a very, very barebones game. Once you have mastered it and can win on highest difficult on all of the tracks it is boring. All you will be doing is the same races over and over again. Online can add some better competition, but it hardly ever works. When it does work it is totally laggy, and I don't even mean the other players are lagging around. It is YOUR bike that is jerking around. What the hell is up with that?!?!? Just no. That's horrible.\n- Make an actually fun career mode to fix this. Take hints from other racing games... I really like how in career on F1 2012 you can complete challenges to "collect data for research" and if you can complete the challenges correctly you can gain a performance improvement that stays for the rest of the career. That is really cool and keeps you playing the career mode, because it is not the same thing over and over again. Add that to this game!!\n- Make online multiplayer actually work, thanks.\n\n2. WHERE ARE THE TWO STROKES? This ain't motocross without two strokes. It even says the displacement limits for the two strokes before you select which class to race. So where are they?\n- Add two-strokes, people love them\n\n3. The sound is HORRIBLE in this game. Seriously what am I riding, a bicycle with a spoke slapper or a high tech racing engineered single? Because in this game it really sounds like a bicycle with a spoke slapper. The sound of the bikes is SO stupid. Jeez it's ridiculous\n- I don't know how the developers managed to screw this up, but unscrew it!\n\n4. The rear end is firmly planted. There is way too much rear end traction. We are riding on the dirt here. In real life the rear end is soooo light and easy to break loose. You can't steer with the rear much in this game because that rear tire won't break loose! Even jabbing fully on the rear brake doesn't cause the tire to lock!\n- Decrease the traction in the rear!\n\n5. The 250's don't have enough power. Seriously, you're telling me I can't power out of a corner in second gear on a 250? That's just wrong. Also the 250's rev WAY too slowly. In real life when you blip the throttle it will go from idle to rev limit before your brain can even process what just happened. On this game it takes a whole 1.5 seconds to rev to the limiter in neutral or in the air. That's wrong.\n- Engines need to rev up more quickly\n\n6. Downshifting and engine braking slow the bike down like magic. Again the rear end is demonstrating way too much traction. If you come hauling â¥â¥â¥ at 50mph into a turn on this game, all you need to do is slam it down to first gear and you immediately slow down to the max speed of first gear. That is so stupid.\n- Decrease the rear end traction!!!\n\n7. The power on all of the bikes is far too easy to control. You can slam it wide open on a 450 coming out of a corner in second gear on this game and everything will be just fine. Really? Because I'm pretty sure that will totally break your â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ open in real life as all the â¥â¥â¥â¥ comes blasting out of it.\n- Power needs to be more violent\n\n8. The whips/scrubs are programmed. You don't get to do them yourself, they just happen if you lean off of a jump. That was really disappointing. The worst part is the impending front flip after you do a whip. You can't throttle out of it after you whip, your â¥â¥â¥ is just going over the bars!\n- At the very least, fix the front flip problem. You should be able to hit the throttle to get the front end up mid air\n\n9. The power on the 450s peaks too early. You make it half way through the rev range and then the power drops off and stops picking up. That's wrong. Yes, 450s have assloads of power at low RPM but they still do peak way up there.\n\n10. No clutch option to slip the clutch. Being able to slip the clutch is important, especially on 250s when you need to get to the meat of the power at the apex of a turn. You can't do that in this game, which is a big problem.\n\n11. The ruts don't really change the way you ride the track. That's totally unrealistic. Ruts are a game changer.\n- Make the ruts able to dig down deeper into the track.\n\n12. Helmet camera is horrible on this.\n- increase the field of view both vertically and horizontally\n\n13. I'd like more setup options. Gear ratio options: you get to choose between low, medium or high. Woooooooooooooooo that's just epic isn't it? NOT -.-\n\n14. Let's have some weather! Motocross doesn't magically make the weather 75F and sunny. Change it up a bit!\n\n15. There just isn't much of an exciting atmosphere to the game. It's pretty drab :/\n\n16. Add some more excitement with camera effects and other special effects. A tiny bit of motion blur and camera shake would be nice. Update the graphics so they don't look so old and plain! Again take hints from other racing games. The Shift 2 / Project CARS game engine is a perfect example of how camera and graphics effects can really make the game!","May 10, 2014","true","25.1"," 19 of 23 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","19","23","0","0"

So I will say no because I dont have a single friend who is into motocross who likes this game enough to buy it.\n\nNow that instantly makes it sound like this game isnt worth your time, but it really depends on who you are. I personally ride in real life, as well as film and help out in the pits for friends when they are racing. This sport is a large part of my life and has been since I was very young.\n\nI also grew up playing the mx vs atv series, a series which was recently resurrected. The best motocross game I have ever played is still "MX vs ATV: Reflex". Unfortunately the MX vs ATV series has reduced in quality and became far too "arcady" since then.\n\nNow, on to this game. I will start with the pros and cons.\n\nPROS:\n\n-HUGE improvement over MUD (the previous MX game released by these devs)\n-Official licensed riders, gear, brands, sponsors and tracks\n-Decent gameplay (more on this later)\n-Decent amount of content\n-Decent Graphics\n-Career mode is pretty cool\n\nCons\n\n-Milestone will barely support their games after release. This game doesn't have glaring technical issues but if it did they would be unlikely to patch it.\n-The gameplay is BARELY Decent\n-Is by no means a Simulator\n-Whip/Scrub physics. We told the devs exactly what needed to be done with the whips and scrubs (make them similar to mx vs atv reflex with slightly more realism) but instead it is just the same locked animation over and over and over.\n-They may not be changing much for the sequel (from what I have seen so far)\n-Audio is S***.   Seriously I had to mute the engine noise it is that bad, sounds nothing like a dirt bike. the saddest part is it is recorded from an actual bike. So i have no idea if it is their equipment, compression or editing that absolutely destroys it.\n-Bikes. the power curve is no where near realistic. I should feel like im riding a bull not a slug\n\n\n\nThe game is alright, a bit of fun when played in moderation. People need to know that this is not a simulator, even though it is commonly reffered to as one. It is only slightly above being very arcady. A big issue with the tracks and physics are jumps and berms. the jumping physics are very floaty and the jump sizes do not appear to be realistically sized compared to their real world counterparts. Then there are berms. in the real world berms are great for catching your speed and helping you maintain it around a corner. If you hit a berm too fast in real life you will likely "blow it out" meaning the front end pushes through the dirt ruining the line and likely making you crash. in this game you cant hit 90% of berms (the tops of berms specifically) without them blowing out, at any speed, which completley ruins the point of even putting them on the track. In other words, some parts of the track dont have collisions.\n\nThen there are controls. It is great that they copied mx vs atv and added dual stick controls. one stick for the rider weight and one for the bike steering. This is one of the biggest improvements over "MUD". In-air controls are horrible. Hit a jump leaning back and go front end high? Too bad even leaning all the way foward and hitting the back brake as hard as you possibly can (as you would do in a worst case senario in real life) wont save you. There is no engine gyro effect, throttle and brake have little or no effect in the air which is very dissapointing. Cornering is Good but not great, track degradation doesnt effect you very much.\n\nDont even think about playing this game without a controller, that makes it multiple times worse.\n\n\nI could elaborate more on the cons of this game but I wont. If a casual arcade game without a lot of challenge (after you get used to the basic controls) is what you are after go ahead.\n\nDie hard motocross fans who want a simulator are still stuck with the dated, but still the closest thing to a full on simulator we have, "MX simulator" it isnt on steam and certainly isnt for everyone but if you have the same complaints as me it may be what you are after.\n\nI look foward to seeing if they respond to fans and make improvements in the sequel, due out early 2016.\n\n(I personally have my doubts as the devs seem to think the main playerbase is children, reffering to us as "crazy crossers" on facebook... Cringe worthy)\n\nProve me wrong Milestone!","January 1","false","12.2"," 23 of 34 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","23","34","0","4"

This is a good simulation of the real motocross event and how the bike handles. You can play as the official riders and race on the real world motocross tracks. Also, you get bikes like KTM, Suzuki, Honda, Yamaha, Kawasaki and Tm (I don't remember the last manufacturer). In Career mode, you start as a wildcard rider and if you are good enough, you'll move up to the MX1 class. The riding physics are good, and it is somewhat newbie-friendly. It will take a while to get used to the handling of the bike, and the AI (on easy they can be a challenge if you are new to the game).\n\nOne drawback is you can't turn off the controller vibration. This is pretty annoying, especially for someone who doesn't like to play with vibration (like me). The multiplayer? There's almost no one playing there, but it doesn't bother me.\n\nIf you are planning to get this game, I suggest that you get a controller first. You'll have a hard time playing using the keyboard.

Firstly the graphics are the best of a MX game yet. Although the graphics to the track are kind of weird and abnormal but still look fine. The handling is a bit strange at first but once you put in a few races it should be fine. The game limits you on tracks and also customization. The teams and venues are a nice addition to the scene of MX games. Overall I'd give it a 7/10.

That said, I expected to enjoy this title, but it failed to impress. There's simply too many flaws for it to be enjoyable (mostly technical, however).\n\nDon't get me wrong, the game has several good points, and the gameplay itself is rather fun, it just has far too many technical flaws. For one, the game's Vsync is broken. I have a 60Hz monitor, but the game chose to run at 30fps instead. I noticed that others had this problem and ended up disabling this Vsync, which led to framerates of ~200 and some very nice screen tearing. I did solve this by using AMD's control panel, but I shouldn't have had to take that extra step.\nThe game also had several sound issues. A lot of sounds weren't even implemented (really noticeable when your bike goes airborne) and the bikes sounds that were implemented just didn't sound right. I know what these bikes sound like and this just isn't it. Oh, and the game's online service? Broken. Tried three times over three days to play with a friend of mine and it couldn't hold a session for more than a minute. Very disappointing.

First of all, even on the highest setting with Pro physics, the AI isn't too hard to beat, and this is coming from someone born the same year Mount Everest was first successfully climbed. The AI appears to have enough straightaway speed but the human player seems to be able to negotiate the corners better. It's not a deal breaker for people like me, but for the very skilled, well, you're going to be bored against the AI, but then that's why there's online racing.\n\nTo be clear, it's the overall speed of the AI which people might find not as challenging as they wish. In all other respects, the AI riders are outstanding. They take different lines through the corners. They battle one another and occasionally they fall over or crash. They will react to a human player or another AI driver by moving over or sometimes changing lines to block. And they ride differently from one another as they race, they don't all run some hypothetical best racing line. They do seem very much like human racers.\n\nIf you do want more of a challenge, race in first person view rather than third person or chase view. You will need a video card that can handle it and probably a strong stomach as well, as this can be a bit nausea inducing. It does make the racing more difficult, but at a  cost, so I can't really say that it's a viable solution for everyone.\n\nI'd also mention that I've never raced motocross, and it's been four decades since I've been on a motorcycle. So I cannot address the realism of the representation of motocross racing versus the real thing from an actual rider's point of view. However, I think this is true for most people playing a racing game. Also, realistically there's no point in trying to sell again that's so realistic that it would be impossible for most people to play it with any level of accomplishment.\n\nMy thumbs up recommendation is based upon my perception as I play MXGP. It seems like what I would imagine a motocross bike would feel like to race. I'm using an Xbox360 controller on my PC and controlling the bike is smooth and intuitive. I race with Pro physics and using the two sticks for steering, bike tilt and body lean, I have no issues at all.\n\nIn my opinion, a successful racing game should present the player with a risk/reward challenge. MXGP does this well. It's possible (again, using Pro Physics) to drive easily and stay upright and on course. However, by judicious pushing at the right time, the player can be rewarded with a lower lap time, although he or she risks a tumble if pushing just a bit too much, or if an AI or human opponent gets involved. This is what a proper racing game should do, give the player a sense of satisfaction for taking risks.\n\nAdditionally, the tracks in MXGP don't force the player into a "best" racing line. It's possible to try different paths in corners, over jumps and even on straights, trying to tie together a better lap. Again, as a player, it's my perception that I'm going faster because I'm exploring difference approaches to each section of the track, and that's enjoyable. The tracks have realistic looking ruts, humps and bumps and during my races I felt that those track features made a real difference to my racing success or failure.\n\nThe tracks in MXGP present an interesting variety of layouts, elevations and difficulties. I find the variety challenging and again, enjoyable. Graphically they look pretty good as well. The graphics are not 2014 cutting edge, but I think cutting edge is a waste in a racing game outside of the track itself. It's good to have trackside objects to give of speed and provide a sense of  immersion for the player, but objects that are too complex a polygon count would raise the minimum and recommended specs for the game for no real additional purpose. It's better for more folks to enjoy the game at 60 fps. This is not to say that the trackside objects are sparse or of poor visual quality. The opposite is actually true, there are plenty of things to see and they give a great visual appeal to the venue where you are racing.\n\nThe  lack of a challenge from the AI mentioned at the beginning is really the only serious complaint I have, and of course there's always online racing if you want more of a challenge. I've done several online races and it's pretty straightforward to find a race. I did experience a lot of lag of the other players' avatars, but probably most of them are on the other side of the Atlantic from me, so that's to be expected. The game did run smoothly even with the other racers' lag and with the collision option set to off it really didn't affect my enjoyment.\n\nSo overall I'm giving this game a positive recommendation. I would strongly suggest that anyone who might be interested in purchasing the game first give the demo a try. The demo is very representative of the experience you'll find in the game.\n\nThanks for reading this review!","March 30, 2014","true","15.7"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

It is now rare to find anyone even in the lobby just a few months after the games release.\n\nGreat tracks, great graphics, great potential, but the fatal flaw of zero developer support after the sale makes me say either give this one a pass or if you think you'll be happy with the single player pick it up when its 5 bucks.\n","September 24, 2014","false","62.9"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","11","19","0","0"

It has a few different race options so you can do an instant race or a career mode. The game also has a multiplayer online that I have not tried out. The graphics look sort of dated. They do not look bad. However they do not have the wow factor either. That being said the tracks you race on are varied and a good mix. Some of the tracks have a lot of elevation and some are more flat with little hills scattered around the track. I also think the intro to each track is very well done. Live action video intermixed with game footage. It looks cool.\n\nI have the game on easy and on easy as you would expect its super easy to come in first in every race. I find that to be a good thing because the handeling is a bit of mystery to me still. You control the bike with left stick and the rider with the right stick. In theory this should make it more interesting in practice I found it to be a mixed bag. My issue with the handeling of the bike is that the rider will sometimes fall for no reason at all. It can be annoying. A turn you think you can make if you lean to the right can cause you to wipe out. So if you do not lean at all you can easily take the corner perhaps because sometimes he will go nuts and crash for no reason. That is very annoying and really hurts the gameplay. It would help if they would have added a meter to let you know what caused the crash and how to avoid crashing in the turns. Something like what Forza and Grid 2 has.  A meter to let the player know if he is leaning to far left or right. It feels like a lot like luck when you can manage a turn.\n\nMy other nit pick besides the weird falling down is other riders hitting you and making you crash. Now this looks cool because it can also happen to other computer motorcycles. So that is cool. However the AI racers can be really agressive and can knock you off your bike while they get off scott free. Thats annoying. You can do it to other racers but again its mostly just luck if you pull it out.\n\nMy other nit pick is the sound. The game cut me off from sound into my next race and this appears to be a common complaint that just never got fixed. I have my audio settings for stero only. Also the game crashed on me one time however after having played a few more races it has yet to repeat this issue. The sound when it works is very good.\n\nI feel like I should mention one more thing. The tracks have very little life to them. While the tracks look good and are varied their is not a lot that moves on them in the background. I wish the game had more background stuff that moved more. For an example in one race map their is a wind turbine and it looks good but it never moves. So its a mixed bag. If I was rating it I would give it a 7/10. The other thing is the price for $20 dollars I would never buy this as its to expensive for what you get. For the price of $5 to $10 dollars its a lot better looking at this price. I paid 5.\n\nAlso this is not an arcade game but more of a lite simulator. You cannot go full bore thru the corners as you will crash out. So you do have to watch the throttle also you can customize your bike for suspension and gear ratios.","July 21, 2015","true","10.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I had seen the negative reviews on the "MotoGP 14" game (mainly things that said "stay away from this developer"). However, I chose to ignore this, and I am glad that I did as the game seems pretty good!\n\nDon't use the vsync setting within the game as it will perform "vsync" to 30fps instead of 60fps. Instead, use the vsync settings on your GPU's control panel (remember to set Triple Buffering too for an even smoother vsync). In fact, you should set all of the graphics options (e.g. anti-aliasing) within the GPU control panel also. All of this is based on information provided directly by Milestone on the following Steam forum post:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/256370/discussions/0/558752449290544521/?insideModal=1#c558752449500535076\n\nI was able to set everything to the maximum level and I get smooth 60fps on a twin GTX 980M in SLI.\n\nThe beginner option offers a valid challenge for those new to that type of game. Since I am new to motorcycle games, I chose this option and I was pleased with it.\n\nThe career mode is reminiscent of Project Cars; the fake social media and the emails from the team. This is a nice touch.\n\nI haven't tried the multiplayer options, so unfortunately I cannot comment.\n\nOverall, I recommend this game wholeheartedly.\n\nEnjoy!","June 28, 2015","true","4.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kingtd1/recommended/256370/","kingtd1","Teddy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kingtd1/","175 products in account","This is a really awesome game. It can appeal to those who really race and appreciate the physics of the realistic mode more, or those who just like to play a fun racing game. If you are wondering how this compares to other off road racing games, particularly MX vs ATV, this is how:\n-MXGP has really good physics and is less arcady than MX vs ATV (especially when you are on the realistic mode)\n-MXGP gives you option to set up your bike however you choose. This will probably appeal to those who really race or know a thing or two about it.\n-MXGP has a more realistic career mode, letting you choose a team to sign with and wearing your endorsments on your jersey and bike.\n-MXGP features all real brands, people, and tracks, unlike MX vs ATV (MX vs ATV only has KTM available as a real brand for dirt bikes)\n\nThose are just a few of the ways MXGP beats MX vs ATV. As far as the graphics and sound go, I'd say both games are pretty good there. MXGP does have nice graphics, but the animation at the end of the race when you win is just... unnatural.\nMX vs ATV give you more things to do, being a game that doesn't only focus on dirt bikes (even though that was probably their main focus).\nMX vs ATV lets you drive a bunch of other different vehicles like an ATV, trophy truck, and more. MX vs ATV also features more types of racing. It features supercross, motocross, enduro, and has free ride available.\n\nThings I wish were included in this game:\n-Free ride\n-Enduro\n-Hard Enduro\n-Multiplayer for each of those things\n\nOverall, MXGP is a great game for motocross enthusiasts and your average gamer alike. As for which of the two games mentioned are better, that depends entirely on you and the features/style of offroad racing game you want. MX vs ATV supercross is planned and hopefully supercross isnt the only style of racing they include because that is one thing that I do love about Reflex (the amount of racing styles available).\n\nAnother thing is that MX vs ATV might beat MXGP with the real time ground deformation, but both games do it well.","April 6, 2014","true","5.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Playing with others is the only real option as singleplayer is just too easy even on the maximum hardest settings possible, so you're gonna have to make an account to play online for the real experience, if you are able to find a game and join it, well done this is usually a very hard task as multiplayer is buggier than the BF4 launch.\nOnce you get into a lobby you have to skip through about 10 cut scenes to finally get racing, on the line the bikes are screaming in 8bit audio, as the race starts you glitch through the gate as it doesn't drop which is pretty â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, you rush to the first corner as all the players ride into eachother and take everyone out, it's not fun with collisions...\nAnyway once you're in the lead things are going well for yourself, until you go round a corner leaning about 5 degrees to the side you slide out and you're last, in frustration you try to catch up but in that attempt you fall off again, there is no hope, you leave the server and alt f4 the game and don't play it again for another month, true story gg\n\n\nPros -\n- It's a motocross game, which is rare these days\n- Fun to play with others\n- Good graphics on max settings\n- Lots of 4 stroke bike selections\n- Tracks are half decent even though they are scaled wrong\n- Terrain deformation\n- Good/fast customer support team\n\nCons -\n- You can't lean into corners properly\n- Preset whips looks like you're just crushing your back into itself\n- The jumps are scaled terribly, 250's can't clear most of them and 450's overjump them all.\n- Keyboard controls are impossible, controller 100% recommended\n- No 2 strokes\n- Engine sound effects sound like a game from the 90's\n- Laptop dedicated graphics are unsupported\n- Kicked from multiplayer games which adds to your quitting percentage and is unavoidable\n- No multiplayer VON or type chat support\n- Expensive for what it is\n- Dev's never update the game","June 17, 2014","true","14.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The breaks I never used (never had to).

Controls felt strange compared to Reflex but once you've given them 30 minutes, you're laughing. Would recommend to any MX fan!\n\n**EDIT**\n\nHaving played this a lot more now, I'm going to write a half decent review.\n\nFirstly, I will go onto the base game. As you can see the game is officially licensed, and as such contains most if not all riders, teams, and tracks of the Motocross Grand Prix. Bike sounds (MX2 and MX1) and physics have been faithfully re-created (I'm playing with 'pro' physics enabled) as have the decals and gear etc. The game plays very well, and any fan of the late MX vs ATV games will feel right at home with this having had to deal with the goon riding of 'Alive' (Although Reflex was outstanding imo).\n\nThe career mode is basic yet very enjoyable. You begin your career as a wild card rider in MX2 for one of the lesser known teams, and compete in various GP's all over the world on the very well re-created tracks. By earning points and beating rival riders, you become more established and begin to attract fans and offers from various teams. Your team will set you goals of how many points you need to achieve, although failing to do so repeatedly apparently sees you losing your contract with that team (I've not had this yet). Bigger and better teams such as KTM/RedBull, Honda, Suzuki/Rockstar etc have more demanding goals than the smaller teams, and require you do maintain at least a top 3 position throughout the season. Doing well enough you can either transistion up to MX1 (Where the bikes are considerable more powerful and harder to handle) or choose to stay at MX2... The choice is all yours.\n\nIn terms of gameplay it plays very well. I'm currently running at max graphics and audio setting playing with a Windows Xbox 360 controller, and the game recognised it immedietly (no controller mapping required) so I can't comment on what a keyboard plays like. Rider animations are extremely diverse/dynamic and feel very life-like so it's all good in that department! The graphics are very good, although some people may notice a few crappy textures here and there, but rest assured the level of detail on the rider gear, bikes, tracks etc is more than pleasing. You can scrub too, nuff said.\n\nThe game did receive a few poor reviews which I think (upon actually playing the game) were very unfair. Most reviewers we're expecting an arcade style racer and based they're reviews upon that assumption. So don't knock this one MX fans, this is I think the most fun MX game I have played in recent years! (I've played most too). And to play on real tracksa with fully licensed bikes and sponsors is a nice treat too.\n\nNow on to customisation, which is what most people like these days. You are free to choose the manufacturer of your bike, all the nice toys are there (Yamaha, Honda, KTM, Suzuki, Kawasaki, TMRacing). However, different teams use different bikes, so as offers come your way be sure to check the model of the bike before you decide what team you're going to sign with! (You get multiple chances to change anyway). You can choose from 12 (I think??) set helmets which come with preset goggles, your rider gear is determined by which team you are signed with. As far as boots go, I have no idea. The AI in the game sport boots by Alpinestars, Gearne, Fox etc so I'm not sure why the custom rider is stuck with Sidi boots! As usual you can pick a name and number, as long as that number isn't in use by one of the pro riders in the game. Most players will be pleased however, as there are a lot of teams to choose from all with unique gear so that should satisfy most players.\n\nIn terms of expansion, I see a lot of possibilities. I see most people asking for 2 Stroke bikes, but any real fan of the MXGP would know that they do not race 2 Stroke bikes in the MXGP, only 4 Stroke. Again, they're going for authenticity here guys. I would like to see more tracks added to the game, be they fictional or from other parts of the world (Glen Helen anyone?), or maybe even a track-editor so people can create and share tracks. Who knows.\n\nAnyway, I hope this review helps. I'm overall very pleased with the game as I haven't had a decent MX game to play since I got insanely bored with Reflex (too many hours, lol) so this is a breathe of fresh air. Happy racing dudes!\n\n8.5/10","June 3, 2014","true","83.9"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

The handling/feeling on the bike is great (I solely drive in First Person View), graphics are good, player models are good, tracks are great (and resemble the real ones quite well). Animations could be better, but what should really be improved are the sounds of the engines. They don't feel authentic and sound like generated by a computer program (as they most likely are). Also, the in-game menu is a bit sluggish, but that's definitely something I can live with.\n\nWhile there are things to improve upon, this still is the finest MX game I have ever played and seen. I have to admit, however, that the last game of this sort I have played was "MX 2002 Featuring Ricky Carmichael" on PS2.\n\nSmall tip: I'm currently using the XBox 360 controller for PC and would recommend to any player to choose it over a regular keyboard.

Nice sim, so few gimmicks like arcade style with metal music and stunts for boosts. Good graphics for a smaller indie co, with the dirt sand or pack and showing tracks on later laps. Lots of sweet tight turns so lots of braking rather than just going full throttle all the time.\n\nCan change or remap gamepad keys so u don't have to hold down R1/R2 the entire time (I like A for throttle, X/B front/back brakes) which can make your fingers sore after an hour. Can adjust the bikes some, but no upgrades from what I saw.  A bit annoying is how they reset you if go slightly off the track path, if you make a wide turn it will cost you time so that would be a better way of dealing with it, so wider tracks or allowing to go outside some narrow parameters may be better.

The game is good but quite simply not as polished as other racing games.\n\nI really wanted this to be great as i am constantly on the look out for a Super GT, Moto X bike racing game and all before have dissapointed.\n\nTerrible physics/Ragdoll animations when you come off the bike bring this game down for me and the graphics are sub par with what you would come to expect in 2015, very few options for customisation,  strange animations and a lacklustre attempt at fun/interesting things to do between races also drag this game down further.\n\nOverall i give this game a 6/10.","July 25, 2015","true","2.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I did reccomend it when it first came out, but I'm not misleading anyone. AVOID IT! unless you like to be unimpressed, angry, or have a shop full of breakables that you can destroy once you realize that this game hasn't been patched for almost a year(Its only been out almost a year) and the patch they released didn't help any "Real" problems.\nNeed some proof that I've never been able to get online? Look at my achievements. The only ones I'm lacking are the that require online races. The Devs told me that "Everything was fine and I should be able to connect with no problems" HA What a joke. I got off the phone and instantly tried only to have the same issues.\nThe Devs don't care. They get your money, then they are on the next sucker (Myself included)\nIt had alot of promise, but no way would I recommend this garbage now once I've seen how the Devs have addressed the bugs and complaints. They did NOTHING and will do NOTHING for you or any of us.\nIf you choose to burn money do it with a lighter instead of burning it on this flaming pile.\nI give it a -34/10     As in I want the $34 dollars back I spent for it, but I won't get it.

Nice sim, so few gimmicks like arcade style with metal music and stunts for boosts. Good graphics for a smaller indie co, with the dirt sand or pack and showing tracks on later laps. Lots of sweet tight turns so lots of braking rather than just going full throttle all the time.\n\nCan change or remap gamepad keys so u don't have to hold down R1/R2 the entire time (I like A for throttle, X/B front/back brakes) which can make your fingers sore after an hour. Can adjust the bikes some, but no upgrades from what I saw.  A bit annoying is how they reset you if go slightly off the track path, if you make a wide turn it will cost you time so that would be a better way of dealing with it, so wider tracks or allowing to go outside some narrow parameters may be better. Championship/season rally modes can be a bit annoying - like 30 minutes long on the same track can get really boring, unsure if can adjust it. Fun game so far, probably the best in its genre, MX ATV reflex is decent but more arcade style.\n\nI rate it a 8/10 and a good price would be under $25, since you can probably get 25 hours out of it.","June 24, 2015","true","5.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's just part of the deal though. Not really a complaint.\n-Scenery a bit dull for today's graphics, but bikes look great.\n-Scrubs felt a bit baked, but it's alright.\n\nWith a few tweaks, making an enduro/Dakar/Romaniacs out of this game would be fantastic (even if it was one race). A separate game for Trials would also be pretty cool. I think these guys could pull it off.","April 1, 2014","true","36.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The career mode is top notch, you start out in MX2 and have to race your way to the best teams in MX2 and then work your way through MX1. The ground physics are amazing, the air physics need some work, but ground physics make up for the lack of feeling in the air. The AI is pretty good, they are really hard when you let them get infront of you, its a challenege to catch them, but once you are in 1st, you can walk away pretty easy.

Physics are actually suprisingly great and when the AI is set to realistic; it gives you a challenge (unlike some other motocross games). The bikes look great and so do the riders. I also really like the replay feature (although the ability to rewind would be nice).\n\nHowever, the game acts like it's in Beta. There are many crashes and glitches. And the landscape and overall graphics are pretty terrible for a game made in 2014 (other than the bikes and riders as I mentioned before). The bikes also sound like total crap. There are also only 14 tracks, no free roam (which is understandable for MXGP, but there should be more tracks), very restricted customization, lack of various in-game social feed responses, and so forth.\n\nNow it may seem like this game is outweighed with con's from my review, but if you are tolerant enough to look past these faults; it's actually a pretty good game. The gameplay is really great and I like the idea of being in different teams and having different sponsors (although you cannot choose your sponsors). I also really appreciate having actual bikes and not having to pay money for DLC that allows me to ride a Honda or a Yamaha.\n\nOverall, I think this game is worth it for anyone that rides motocross or dirt bikes in real life (or perhaps just really like motocross games).

The riding mechanics are deep and satisfying, graphics are great, and the AI is perfect in my opinion. This title is from Milestone, a company that creates racing games truly focused on the actual racing. Just like Moto GP 13, this game puts you in a Career that encourages you to learn the track before race day by offering Practice and Qualifying sessions before the actual race. This makes MXGP a highly rewarding racing experience, when racing on the highest difficulty you will need to know your way around the track to earn the medal. I'd recommend MXGP to anyone interested in an authentic racing experience.","April 19, 2014","true","34.1"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

However this fix did revert back to the 30fps after a few days use and I can't get the game running above that any longer.\nSo until the game has a 60fps option working properly in the game without the need for external programs to fix the issue then it's simply unplayable for me and for that reason I cannot recommend it at this time.\nI'm using 2x R9 290X's in a OCUK Infinity Tesseract PC and the game runs like a one legged dog at the moment. The screen tearing is so bad that it isn't playable, its the worst I've seen and even limiting the FPS to 60-63 causes major stalling issues.\nI wanted to give this a good review too.","April 11, 2014","false","8.0"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

This game has amazing graphics, physics, and sound compared to any other game of its kind. Although the ruts don't really do anything, and the revs die mid air, and there's no real mid air movement, it's easily better than any other MX game. What's disappointing is that the game consists of many different 4 strokes, but not a single 2 stroke. Fair enough that during the 2013 MXGP season there weren't any 2 strokes competing, but you've still got to give people the option to ride one. Maybe during rider customisation there could be a choice to make your own bike, and that's where the 2 stroke could come in, but we don't even have the option for that. The game gives many hours of gameplay, online and offline, and there's many different tracks and bikes to choose from. The game has full controller support (thank god), as it would be impossible to play without one. Overall, I'm pretty impressed. All I want to see is 2 strokes, and some DLC, and it would make the game one of my favourite games to this day. A few bugs to be fixed, but like every new game you need to give the developers time to fix them.","April 12, 2014","true","15.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I am going to uninstall it as my time is better served playing polished games.","April 3","false","1.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Guess what? Once again you must restart the game.\n\n- When using the "third person" view of your bike the camera angle will go crazy on tight turns. It feels as though the camera will snap 180 degrees and back again.\n\n- When using "first person" mode and landing after a jump it feels as though your players head goes through his own body and all of a sudden you're trying to drive a dirt bike from a stomachs perspective.\n\n- Overall gameplay and re-play value seems really low, I've experienced all these issues within ~1 hour of play time and the couple minutes of "working" game time I got to play got REALLY boring REALLY quickly.\n\n- Feels like a really bad port job overall.\n\n- This game is just BROKEN and UN-PLAYABLE 90% of the time. Immersion is a big thing when playing super realistic games, and when you have to stop and restart the game several times just to get a few minutes of playability, it really ruins that immersion effect.\n\nTHE GOOD:\n\nThe graphics are somewhat nice?\n\nThe Physics are good enough.\n\nThe race tracks seem to be real race tracks from around the world.\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nI was looking for a fun yet realistic dirtbike game, this looked promising.\nI don't know what else to say about this game, the trailer videos got me excited for a realistic dirtbike racing experience and completly dropped the ball. At this point I'm actually going to use Steams Refund feature to get my money back. Honestly even if this game was on sale for 50% + off I would still NOT RECOMMEND it as it just simply un-playable.","February 28","false","1.0"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","29","2","7","0","0"

This game is  "The Official Motorcross Videogame" and they give you very restriced control expecially in the air. No clutch, and when you are in the air you have to hit the gas twice to make the throttle go. Needs clutch, rear brake and front control sepratly and when you are in full "control" of the rider. Give us a REAL mx game. Otherwise the racing is pretty good along with career, just gets old fast when yo uhave no control of the rider. In the current state of the game without these key parts incorporated into the game, I do not recommend this game...","July 10, 2014","false","7.9"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","2"

It even comes with famous professional Dirt Bike Riders to play as from all around the world.  The Career mode is absolutely amazing, you have a manager and you get offers from different companies in which you could either decline or accept. For example I got offered to ride for a company in which I would have to ride a KTM, and so I accepted it and now I ride for that company.  While in Career mode you can customize your character, get new helmets, change jersey number, change jersey name etc.  You can also check the calender for upcoming races in which you would have to qualify and practice for which in my opinion is quite helpful because you get to Know the track as you practice on it before the real races actually happen.  This game also offers  Multyplayer (although I would like to see more players playing on these  servers, that is one of the main reasons I am writing this) anyways it is quite fun to hook up with some friends and race them against AI or play with other random online players in a huge race to try to get a holeshot.  So it's your choice, do you want to sit on your butt all day playing the demo and wishing more MX games would come out........ OR! are you going to buy this amazing game for NO! not $59.99 but $39.99. It is your decision but I recommend you make it a wise one.\nSEE YOU ON THE TRACK!\n-Scootiemgee","June 10, 2014","true","41.8"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/psuedosurfer/recommended/256370/","psuedosurfer","lunareklipse","http://steamcommunity.com/id/psuedosurfer/","117 products in account","This game has a lot going for it, but falls flat in some very important areas.  On the good side of things the career mode is killer, itâs a really cool idea that keeps things fun instead of just grinding away races for no reason.  Getting interests from teams and getting picked up for new contracts ect.\n\nThe game falls short with the actual riding. This is kind of whatâs important here.  The in air controls are just horrible.  You can't use any gyro effects of the bike to pitch or throw cool whips.  If you try to do a whip it auto corrects you and you will always land, and you can't do a low scrub using the gyro of the bike.  The jumps all seem pre-determined it doesnât seem to matter if you seat bounce, rail a corner and come in hot you almost always go the same distant.\n\nThe ruts develop after racing, but seem to have no mesh behind them, you just ride right past em, There is no getting cross rutted or railing a rut.  The extra lean with the right stick also doubles as the button that makes you auto scrub, so if you try to use your weight in the air to land in a rut you end up doing a scrub and falling. Also if you try to lean into a turn to rail it hard if you catch any air from a bump while railing a turn you start to scrub and fall.  It doesn't seem the right stick actually has any sensitivity it might as well be a button press.\n\nThereâs no clutch or starting gate, you just sit there holding the throttle and you go.  Makes getting a holeshot a tad easy. Also with no clutch it doesnât let you keep traction railing through turns and resort to riding different ways to counteract it.\n\nThe vsync is messed up and holds the game at 30fps, if you shut it off the screen tearing is unbearable. You can work around it but forcing vsync for the game through your graphics card as they have pointed out, but it kinda seems the pc version is an after-thought.\n\nThere are a lot of random bugs with the audio not working, the bike disappearing in your pits or the rider disappearing from the bike, the achievements don't work right, the list goes on; just go read the forums.  Iâve read on there that the multiplayer is a huge hot mess as well, but I havenât even tried playing online yet.\n\nThey had a great idea, the graphics look good, the career mode is great, but I mainly play MX games to shred and this one you just can't. I'm still working through the career mode, but I basically end up wanting to fire up my 360 and play alive or reflex and just throw some dirty whips, feel like you're really killin it.  I expected a lot more for the price of the game, I donât expect the air controls to get fixed if they did that would be huge. It would make the game so much damn better.\n\n\n\n\n","April 5, 2014","false","20.0"," 5 of 14 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","5","14","0","0"

I personally got this game for the career mode,which i might add is just what i want.\nIf you have played MotoGP 2013 then you'll be familiar with the career mode, for those of you who havent then a quick overview:\nYou start out by creating a rider (personal data,appearance,number etc) then you are giving a wild card ride to choose on an MX2 machine, this happens for the first 2 races choosing between the lower level teams. After you have managed to complete both races you are offered a ride to compete on for the following season and so on.\n\nI was quite the critic about this title due to the terrible MUD they released a couple of years ago. Dont be put off tho this is 100000 better than that, i have to add im enjoying it.\n\nYes it has its faults, but on the whole if your a big MX fan like myself then im sure you will enjoy this title.\n\nCons:\n\nLAST GEN technology\nPoor AI (pro & realistic settings) No matter how hard you try to battle and not win, you still do.\nPoor Scrub/whip control. The right thumbstick controls your "scrub" much like reflex, except it is nothing like reflex, its actually just a pre scripted mechanical move that you have no real control over, this lets the game down imo.\nClutch: No clutch.. yes i know, a motocross game with manual gears, no clutch? hmm.. good one Milestone!\n\nNo support for the game and a dead online racing community.\n\nThere are probably a few more cons to this game but my satisfaction of the career mode is dominating them right now so i really couldnt care.","March 28, 2014","true","55.0"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

I mean come on thats just dumb.\n- Needs physics modding a little, its still a little stiff.\n- Varying Careers, its a bit boring after you complete it.\n- Red plate for the points leader.\n- Cairoli wins every qualifying which gets a bit annoying, I ended up trying to knock him off and make him come as lower place as possible to give other AI a chance lol\n- Multiplayer lobby system is bad\n\nOverall its a good fun game which any MX rider would enjoy, it has serious potential when they make the next one.","April 11, 2015","true","155.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Don't get me wrong, I play it a lot. But what other dirt bike game am I supposed to play?\n\nThey tried to copy the MX vs ATV franchise with the physics, but they failed. It is interesting to see that you can crash by leaning to far over in a turn, which is a new aspect others have failed. The bike and rider graphics themselves are very good. However, the track graphics and how the bike reacts to the track is rubbish. Another thing about this game that really does annoy me is the "whip/scrub" feature. MX vs ATV succeeded with allowing you to control the movements, while this game didn't. They only alloy you to do there extremely stupid pre programmed whip/scrub. The tracks could have been done better. What I mean is that there are a lot of jumps you must brake for, or go sailing way past the landing for. As well, there are also a few jumps that no matter how I try, you cannot make them even on the 450. My last complaint would be for the AI's too have been faster. I smoke the "realsitic" ones.\n\nAnyway though, if you wanna spend 20 for this game do it. Sure I complained, but I actually found it fun to try and get used to the awkward physics. Plus it's nice to have a game with all the real companies, teams, and tracks from an actulal series\n","April 2, 2015","true","25.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/snoogans/recommended/256370/","snoogans","Bigums","http://steamcommunity.com/id/snoogans/","213 products in account","This is a game for motocross fans and riders. It's a lot less arcade like than the MX vs ATV series, with a more realistic feel. The handling is pretty awesome with the dual-stick controls and being able to stick to a rut. There are some hiccups with the physics when you get to the outter edge of the tracks, but for the most part they're spot on. This is easily the most fun motocross game I've played. I loved Reflex, and initially coming to this it seemed slow paced and kinda bland, but after racing half a season and really getting the hang of the physics, I can't play Reflex anymore. It is just far to arcade like for me.\n\nMy biggest complaint about this game is the whips and scrubs. There is only one animation for a scrub and you're not able to pull the bike back in mid air. The adds a bit to the realism, but its aggravating that I can't scrub just a little off a smaller double and not worry about not bring it back in time. Also the whip is the same story. One animation and no control over the bike. That's what I do miss about Reflex. You can throw a huge whip or just a little tweak for a landing into a corner.\n\nThe sounds and graphics are awesome. The only graphics issue I have is the rider is really rigid while riding. There is no knees bending or arm movement as you ride. Other than that, best graphics for the genre.\n\nOverall 9/10 - wish Milestone(developers of the game) would make an AMA Nationals game. I'd love to race Glen Helen, Southwick, Washougal, ect. with this kind of gameplay!\n\nAbsolutely recommended for any motocross/supercross fan!","March 8, 2015","true","30.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphics are well done (Minus a bit of terrain pop in. Much better than Reflex though in that regard) I found the AI to be pretty good ramping it up as your skill goes up. You can race with bots online which is a big plus in racing games for me and my friends. Internet games went flawlessly, some people lag but thats just because they are from different countries. Not many play this online but it's a niche market anyways.\n\nDefinitely worth the purchase on sale, even more so if you are a fan of riding.","July 20, 2015","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No, these are in game results that quickly grab your eyeballs and attempt to pull'em from your sockets!\n\nUnlike most motorcycle racers out there, this one definately requires you to pay close attention to not only your speed while cornering, but the use of rider leaning plus turning the bike. Yes, you better let off that throttle else it's into the hay stacks, crowds, and trees.\n\nVery, very different--and not made easy by default! Even with all driving assists enabled, and NPC racers AI set to basic, you will need some patience and determination to succeed at avoiding last place or DNF ranking in every race.\n\nWith that all said, I love this game. Although only scratching the surface thus far, it looks, sounds and feels as expected in a true racing sim. And don't get me started on the personal satisfaction of riding over my buddy, laughing my head off and suddenly taking a dirt-dive myself. Now we both laugh!","August 5, 2015","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I bought MX vs ATV Encore, but got a refund through Steam, as my controller (a Logitech dual) didn't work, so I never got to play that.\n\nI know nothing about the MXGP circuit, so I wasn't sure if I should get it, but all the positive reviews here changed my mind.\n\nNow my review, again coming from a "virgin" of the series:\n\nIt's great! I started on the easiest AI mode to get a feel for it. After qualifying pole and winning every race through the first 6 in career, I bumped up to hard AI. Now at least, I get a challenge from the AI.\n\nTracks look superb, and the bikes do as well. I find myself having a blast as I jump, slide into corners, and run flat out on straightaways.  Overall, the fun factor is a 10/10.\n\nOf course, as with any game, there are some bugs. Namely, bike disappears in the pit after running practice, qualifying, and usually Race 1. Also, the sound cuts out to the point I have to back out and restart the game. And, I get a temporary freeze in the action during a race that can get annoying.\n\nOverall, this game is nicely done, and I'm going to start watching the real MXGP circuit on TV to judge how realistic the game is. From what I've seen thus far, it seems to be as real as a video game can be! I love watching replays of my races. The attention to detail can really be seen here; from the lighting, to the tracks, to the dirt on the bikes and riders, it gives a realistic appearance of a race.\n\nI recommend this game for anyone who, like me,  wants something different from F1 or "left turn only" Nascar games.","February 7","true","11.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
