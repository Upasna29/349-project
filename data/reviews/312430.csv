NOT A FINAL VERDICT! (Also, I'm just a guy who plays games, not a professional).\n\nI won't recommend it at this time, as it seems like they took Wizard Kings (Columbia Games, Boardgame) and changed just enough to muck it up. The devs seem extremely engaged, so I hope that over the next year, all of these items will be addressed.\n\n-The means of conquering provinces: You deplete the resources (not raiding and gaining immediate, but just destroy it) until it has ZERO value, and then it becomes yours as a pyhrric trophy.  You now have to spend money to rebuild it based on the type of terrain it is.  This is clunky and offers the player exactly ONE way to gain land.\n\n--On a related point, now there is a chance of revolt in that province.  2% doesn't seem too bad, so you leave it alone for 5-10 turns...  It will eventually burst out with a ridiculously large force of local rebels that are stronger and better equipped than the nation that spawned them.  Also, didn't I just DESTROY the economy?  How are they getting their arms and supplies? (I suppose the 7 Samurai argument of hoarding farmers applies...).\n\n-/+ I both love and hate the campaign.  I know it's a work in progress, but it could use some more balancing yet.  This is due mostly to the number of variables: Empires all have their own version of units, they all have different types and quantities of lands (each yielding different ammounts of gold), and they start next to adversaries or potential allies of varying strength.  Your goals are unique for each to compensate (somewhat) for the difficulty of your initial state.\n\n-- However, if you were looking for a game with less static values (e.g. "I want to play as a 5 star Elven race"), you can't.  At least, not yet.  Who knows?  I would prefer to have the map's ethnic boundaries variable in at least one game mode, allowing the player to choose their race for a domination game, but use another races starting area and resources.  It would convert the land to your type and swap with theirs, so they would then take your area.  This would only be for non-campaign games (obviously).\n\n-No multiplayer.  Not even hotseat.  Hopefully will be implemented in some form.\n\n-A lot of turns are spent gathering resources (gold), without much to do.  Overall, not a huge issue, but the pacing is a bit slow even for my tastes (and I love Twilight Imperium-style BGs with 6 players...).  This is not so much of an issue for larger races, but for some starting positions, it can impede the fun factor.\n\n-Can't improve areas other than economically.  No forts, no special sites.  If it wasn't on the map to begin with, it's not there.  Should have some sort of specialization process for areas (military, economic, magic, diplomacy).  Would give more options for those slow turns.  Even is it's just a minor bonus, they add up over time.\n\n-Can only directly command battles with a hero.  This means that composition determines likelihood of victory, but not all races have ranged, cavalry, or versatile units, making this treatment especially harsh and the conclusion more tragic.\n\n-Stacking limits (20 per army, only one army per zone).  This makes it feel more boardgamey again, and really detracts from the strategy.  Why can't I have two armies move into the same zone to do a coordinated strike?  Why not make the PLANNING of the attack happen during the turn, and the actual combats all happen after you hit "end turn"?  This would be more like Warhammer's "Mighty Empires" rules...  Then have an increased upkeep modifier for "overage", such that you now can keep more than 20, but it will cost you (1.5x or something).\n\n-Tactical movement.  It is like moving a ladle through molasses.  There need to be options for scroll speed and mouse response.  As it stands, it feels disjointed.  Additionally, near screen edges there are issues clicking on units, so you have to center them and then deliberately click on them.  It gets frustrating and also occurs on the strategic map.\n\n-/+ Music glitches occassionally.  Has a "tick" that occurs in the songs and I've taken to switching it off.  Otherwise, it's fitting and pleasant.\n\nRECOMMENDATION: Keep an eye on this one, and if you want to help out in its development, buy it.  Otherwise, I'd say go for Dominions 4 for now and check back.  It just has more options and is (right now), the better game in almost all respects.","April 10, 2015","false","7.3"," 126 of 162 people (78%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","78","126","162","6","5"

Brutal, but not as unforgiving as Dominions, the game has a level of difficulty that can appeal to veterans of the genre but not high enough to detract casual players.\n\nThe game's nations have unique goals and storylines, with several having multiple objectives while some have harder single objectives. These can vary from reclaiming your kingdom's old glory, to forming a Grand Alliance of free states. Several even have no ambitions beyond seeing other specific nations do better than everyone else.\n\nThe rosters are different depending on race, with variations depending on nation in that race. Allying someone gives you one of their nation specific units as an Auxiliary. Combat is tough, and forming armies for either auto-resolving or leading the attack yourself are viable strategies. Sadly only armies led by heroes can actually be commanded, and other than random chance there is no way to recruit heroes (who can die). Different unit types (cavalry, infantry, "archers" which include mages, and siege) have different effects that when combined with your hero or other units special abilities can be devastating. There is a magic system in the game, it is a little shallow but still very useful. Upgrading it can be risky as you have to invest a percent of your income to it.\n\nThere is currently no economy tab, just an overlay when you hover over your gold which sadly does not always work. Income is easy enough to calculate, 150 gold per economic level in a given region. Each region can be upgraded, and each nation is able to upgrade a certain terrain type cheaper. There are special resources, gathered at 1 per turn with no way to change output, that can either be put towards buying certain units or selling on a world market.\n\nThe devs have added modeling tools to the game, and soon it will be workshop connected. I can't wait to see what players will come up with, and I hope this helps keep a thriving community. Also active, the devs released a bug patch after only a day of release. Their attention is on this game, and I hope to see additional improvements in the future.\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone who has every felt the tug of "one more turn" or anyone who likes heavier board games. It is not for the faint of heart, and certainly not for beginners, but anyone at least familiar with the genre should easily enjoy this game.","April 10, 2015","true","54.7"," 37 of 42 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","37","42","0","0"

V2.0 is getting back to being a stable version and the developers are now picking up pace of the fixes, and will hopefully soon be putting in new features for the game.  There are still some basic issues for me, not enjoying the tactical battles so much as they are today compared to 1.9, but progress is going in the right direction and developers are actively taking on board suggestions and feedback.  Suggest if you are interested in buying you keep an eye out on development and feedback in the forum of the latest updates. Getting back to being a recommended game, a little more to develop.\n\nUPDATE 15th FEBRUARY 2016.  I apologise to the 15/16 people who found my original positive review helpful.  As a warning, while v1.9 is still available, the game using the new engine build (v2.0) is backwards in many aspects and has multiple issues with bugs, CTD, UI, that hinder enjoyment for established players, so I suspect new players especially would struggle with 2.0 (although you can still play 1.9 and may enjoy this).  As 2.0 is the future for this game, and the state is poor (albeit it's been in beta review since prior to Christmas and development appears quite slow for the tiny development team) I can no longer recommend purchases of this game in the present state.  If the state improves to an enjoyable game, following successful patches, I will be able to revert to my original review.  My original review is left up for reference, regarding how enthusiastic I was for this game in 1.9.  I still support this game and its development, but can't recommend people spend significant money on this game in current state.  My review would change to Not Recommended today.\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nI really enjoy fantasy wargaming over futuristic (Warhammer v Warhammer 40,000), so this type of game really appeals to me.  It feels like Game of Thrones on a board. I was worried about purchasing because of mixed reviews on how the early access is going.  I wasn't disapointed to buy in December 2015 - it's a very good game, and turning into one of my favorites.  It's not a bad game at all as it is, but I'm looking forward very much to future developments and polishing up.\n\nPositives:\n\nExcellent fantasy setting, many unique factions to play (Humans, Giants, Orcs, Elves, Dwarves, Undead, etc) all with unique troop types and abilities.  The factions vary in strength and size, making for some unique gameplay.\n\nThe tactical battles are good. With so many unique troops you have to plan how best to use them against a wide variety of opponents.  Reminds me of games like Fantasy General.  Each troop has morale and health, and you need to keep an eye on both.\n\nReasonable magic system where it takes a little while to build up your spellcasting capacity.\n\n22 hours on record and only one crash (but it was a crash at an annoying position just as I was winning a major battle).\n\nHours and hours of campaigns and scenarios (most are VERY lengthy) due to having some kind of World domination requirement.  Even the smaller Scenarios will require you to wipe out 5 or more factions.\n\nEach province is unique so has a description, and possibly some good bonuses if you take it on - a new resource, a boost to magic experience or a unique feature available to just the holder of the province.\n\nThe art work and theming is pretty nice, though I agree with some peoples thoughts it would be nice to have more background to the factions for immersion purposes.\n\nLand and sea combat represented, plus some flying monsters available and siege (to take on enemy forts).\n\nSome Improvements Required:\n\nThe economy is quite basic.  There are a number of goods to trade, and goods are required to build unique troops.  But for province income, you simply have to pay to build up economic value of a province, which in return gives you greater future income.\n\nThere's no buildings in provinces.\n\nDiplomacy is quite simplistic and limited.  There's no way currently to move through a faction to get to another faction, you fight provinces around you only. Also if you start as a major faction, and just take over just one other factions capital (wiping them out) everyone will hate you.  You'll never be able to get friends easily again, let alone alliances.\n\nOverall : If you're thinking about this and worried about early access, I would recommend buying anyway if you're half interested. It's excellent value for money.  I put in more hours on this than I do major game studio releases that cost more than twice the money.  Highly recommended by a wargaming strategy and tactics fan.","December 9, 2015","true","41.4"," 30 of 33 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","30","33","0","0"

Although there are plenty of games that it has a superficial similiarity to, such as Dominions 4, Crusader Kings II, Europa Universalis IV, ect, it definitely does its own thing and has something to bring to the plate, especially if you want your turn-based wargaming itch scratched.\n\nThe game revolves around picking one of 35 nations, each with their own history, diplomatic/geographic/military/magical advantages and disadvantages, and gameplay style. These nations are not balanced, but even the smallest and weakest of nations can fight off larger nations and become victorious. There are also multiple win scenarios you can choose from the very beginning, including a storyline campaign for each of them with unique victory conditions and events (And these storyline campaigns are very cool. This is one of the killer features of this game, in my opinion)\n\nProduction values are a little bit higher than standard Slitherine fare, but not by much. Right now many units share splash art, but what art there is in the game is great. The map is also beautiful, but missing some of the nice features that Paradox games have (Though these features are on the minimap). The user interface is a little weak too.\n\nMore importantly than that stuff though, the game is actually fun. Battles are interesting, and when you get into a fight, provinces are represented correctly on the tactical map, which is a really awesome touch and adds a bit of strategy as to which province you might want to attack from. The grand strategy component is also fun, but aspects like trade and building up provinces could use some fleshing out.\n\nAs far as bugs go, there are some annoying ones, but nothing too game breaking.\n\nThe devs have stated that they want to add new features, and hopefully those new features will strengthen up the weaknesses of the game, but I think I can't stress enough that the game is fun to play right now, and should only get better and better. There is a lot of content to delve into already, and even though the price may seem a little steep compared to some of the flashier games, I think it was worth it.","April 11, 2015","true","16.8"," 25 of 31 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","25","31","0","0"

There are many good tactical turn based strategy games and some really nice grand campaign games but their is a serious lack of combining them both and I think Sovereignty start to deliver and achieve this any time soon.\n\nDevelopment of the game is ongoing for about two years in EA (I guess) and just before release last year the team decided to rebuild the engine and start from scratch. Reason they mentioned in the forum was that the game was starting too complex for his own good technically/engine wise and the ambition to make the game multiplatform.\nResult was that in the middle of the EA progress the game went from 80% completion to 10% completion with the new engine and it tooks a long LONG way to manage to get the game back on track and achieve the same quality of the almost finshed game.\n\nBut in the end after six major updates (around 100 serious bugfixes, tweaks, wishes from the community per patch) to the new engine this year the result is here and I can finally recommend the game because it is a pleasure to play now.\n\nThe replay value is gigantic. You can choose over 20 different realms (possibly more) and they are all very different and have there own unique role in the big campaign world. Every realm has it's own story campaign you can try to achieve victory with and you can choose around another five victory conditions for every realm you choose to start.\n\nIt's not just some stats which makes some units unique compared to each other but it's a totally different playstyle not seen in any other game. Dwarves who owns iron resources on the map and are good defenders and like a drink sometimes, elves who live in magic woods and all kind of fantasy monsters and humans with their own unique units, own resources, own buildings, own unique economy and spell list.\n\nYou can send spies to other realms, trade with other realms and have a good set of diplomatic options which not only affect AI behaviour towards you but influence the whole campaign map.\n\nThe best thing for me in this game if that war happened you can finally play out the battle yourself on a high quality tactical battlefield and those battles can last an hour easy. (I like to play on a slow speed setting and calculate every move etc etc). After battle you are able to upgrade units with medals, or choose traits for your hero.\nIn the battle itself you have an arsenal of tactical traist like "hit and run", capture units and break the morale of enemy units.\n\nThe game is far from finished but at the moment of writing the closed beta 2.0 is almost finished to release public and with all the tweaks, new updates, new mechanism (prisoners, buildings and economy system) this is the right moment to start your EA adventure in this game.\n\nIf the devs keep their ambition to deliver like they did the last few months I can imagine that this game can become a big hit for strategy and turnbased tactical fans if they get some attention from the better game journalism magazines, like Explorminate[dot]net for example, they absolutely deserve.\n\nIt's just a massive title grows for some reason to big for the devs to handle last year but they are back on track and get my well deserved recommend thumbs up today.\nFinal verdict 7,5 out of 10 score at the moment but can easily get an 8+ when developing continues the way it does now. Gameplay is a 9 score for sure. But some elements are rushed and made without enough eye for detail. Some incosequent artwork in buttons, cut off lines in tiles on the battle map, no explaination for all battle traits and some game crashes for some people even after two years of development makes this final score.\n\nSo only buy at the moment if you like to help to shape the game whithout getting daily updates from the devteam (updates now are on a monthly base) and without expecting they respond to all the suggestions you make.\n\nInstant buy when it's on sale. As a Slitherine title it isn't on sale very often.\n\nOr wait till the game shaping up when beta 2.0 is released to public and more people can give input and help the small team to fix bugs.

I really enjoy this game.  First, the art and atmosphere is excellent.  I'm a strategy hound and I've had hundreds of hours of gaming fulfillment with games that have horrible graphics like the Dominions series or Stars!  I don't require graphics, but Sovereignty turns my head.  I feel like it is a beautifully detailed board game.  The music is agreeable.\n\nWhat makes this game stand out is the combat system.  A tremendous amount of thought and creativity has gone into the tactical combat system and I respect and applaud the designers.  This isn't the worn out rock, paper, scissors of archers beat spears beats cavalry beats archers.  Instead, infantry is usually weak with lower attack and defense values, but contains the potential to become a tank in numbers and with positioning.  Infantry has an attribute called Shield Wall which gives it (and it's neighboring Infantry) a defensive bonus against archers and cavalry.  If you have two fellow infantry touching you, you get the maximum bonus.  This is pure genius!  It is similar to fighting with one ally having your back or being in a line of infantry, one on each side of you.  Once a Shield Wall gets set up, it can be a tough nut to crack!  This makes it interesting that one or two infantry can just be bypassed, but a line of them literally wall off an area.  Archers have the standard offensive, defensive, and counter-fire functions, but place a row of say 3 archers behind a line of maybe 4 infantry and you have an incredibly effective army.  Siege weapons like catapults can shock the infantry in a wall, archers can soften them up, then you can charge with your cavalry to try to puncture through or flank around.  It's a lovely system and it's the core of why I like this game.\n\nAnother solid implementation in this game is terrain.  The various races have terrain they prefer economically, but also give them advantages in combat.  The foresters prefer the woods and mountaineers the mountains.  Forests decrease the effectiveness of arrows.  When you defend in the woods or mountains, you get a +2 defensive bonus.  Hills give +1 for attack and +1 for defense.  As a cavalry specialized nation, Berany, I dominated with Uhlans in the plains.  Then when I took those horses into the mountains, my speed was gone and my combat effectiveness plummeted.  I really  liked that visceral feeling the terrain gave me in the gaming experience.  I was crushing opponents with my charges and felt the game was getting too easy until I hit the mountains or ran into the Boruvian Empire's Royal Pikes.  The pleasure I got raining arrows down on the opposing infantry as they waded through the river was satisfying.\n\nThe spell system is still in development and needs work.  You are limited to six spells.  Some people don't like that limitation, but I do.  I like tough but interesting choices.  The problem right now is there are too few spells to choose from.  Basically, there's really no choice of the 8 or 9 spells.  Everyone will pick the same best 6 for their nation.  I'd like to see more spells and more variety, but still limit our choices.  The magic research system is brilliant.  You get five points of magic research per turn for every 1% of your economy you devote to research.  This is revolutionary.  In other games, to research a certain spell or breakthrough, there is a fixed cost because gold or income essentially is equivalent to research.  Therefore, typically it is better to scale up your economy first, then do research.  This means large civilizations, space empires, or what have you, will always have more technology than smaller ones.  Not so in Sovereignty!  Even if I have only one province, like Sirucil, I can be #1 in Magic Research if I commit a higher percentage of my economy to research.  Kudos to the designers on this!  Other games in the genre should adopt this method of determining the cost of research.  On the flip side, military powers can capture Landmarks on the global map to speed research, which works well.  As your domain expands, you will have larger military upkeep costs and may need to cut back on your magic research, but Landmarks enable you to somewhat keep up in the arms race.\n\nUnits come in standard, mercenary, elite, and unique unit types.  Mercenary units typically have short build times, but high upkeep.  Elite units are limited to four total you can have at a time, and uniques are one unit only.  I really like having few unit types because it forces to me try to use different units in different combinations.  Each nation has an incredibly different play style and experience due to this restriction.  As Sonneneve, I had one superb unique healer, my Unicorn, for my entire nation.  That made my army with that healing unit much more effective than any of my other armies.  With Bereska, my only healers were my elite War Priests.  I researched Herbalism to increase the healing power of those four units and they were able to fully heal one unit per combat round.  As Berany, my Uhlans are classified as mercenaries so I utilized a Mercenary Captain hero to get a double turn with them once per battle.  I used the same technique with Marna's Gendarmes as Myrmont.\n\nUnits are either single individuals or groups.  Groups lose combat effectiveness as they take damage whereas individuals do not.  So as my archers take damage they become ineffective, but my Bone Demon still does as much damage at 50% health as he did at 100%.  On the other hand, it becomes harder to damage groups with arrows as they become fewer in number, but individuals are fully vulnerable to arrows.  Clever system!  You can soften groups up with volleys of arrows, but you still need infantry or cavalry to follow on.\n\nAlthough the tactical battles shine, the strategic portion of the game is rudimentary.  The map overall is promising with interesting variations of terrain, special landmarks, and particular provinces with special abilities like allowing you to dramatically improve your diplomatic communication times.  However, provinces can only be developed through a simple mechanic of leveling a province economically.  Capital provinces can be leveled to a max of 9, ports to 7 and all other provinces to level 5.  To capture a province, you must lower that development level down to zero, one turn at a time.  After you capture the province, you can then build it back up, one turn at a time.  There is no infrastructure currently as far as building additional fortifications or buildings.  Frustratingly, you can't even build roads to speed up the travel times of units through your territory.  You don't unlock more possible units to construct by building something like an archery range to allow construction of archers from that province.  Instead, you can build any unit right from the start of the game in any province you own as long as you have the resources.  You can obtain resources via trade, or buy purchasing them on the market.  Sometimes you won't see the particular resource you need for 20 turns, then it will show up for one turn with 15 for sale, then the next turn it's gone.\n\nDiplomacy is basic as well.  Besides trading resources, you can establish non-aggression pacts and alliances.  Interestingly, if you are in an alliance, you can build one additional unit type from your ally.  If you go to war with that ally though, the units disband.\n\nThe game is in early access.  It is currently very buggy and I've had countless CTD's.  Sometimes I have to restart my computer to get the game to load.  The AI needs serious work.  There are balance issues.  Some unit functions (like cavalry's Roll Up) are not currently functioning.  On the plus side, the developers are quite responsive.  I am still playing this game and I really hope they succeed.  This is a special game and the designers are to be commended for some revolutionary concepts.","May 17, 2015","true","73.4"," 19 of 25 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","19","25","0","3"

This makes it impossible to actually have a campaign against a major foe when every single nation around you will just constantly attack you.\n\nAlmost constant warfare gets to be tiresome when the system makes attacks hoping you choose the "auto" function giving them an edge, but since I know better I am forced to choose tactical and watch the enemy wander in my direction. The game seems to know it cannot win but still wastes 10 minutes of my time to make sure I know they cant win. Perhaps armies could be harder to raise in order to prevent a world that it nothing but maxed out armies making constant border attacks. I am starting to think the game attacks just becuase it has the armies sitting around...and well...what the hell?\n\nThe Good so far:\n\nI love the combat system with its easy flow and straight forward goals.\n\nI like the hero system with the cards that give you a one time bonus during battle. They really can swing a battle your way when all hope seems lost.\n\nThe trade system which I have just begun to get into seems good and the way it plays into the overall game is great.\n\nI really like the troop types I have seen so far! The vast amount to choose from across the spectrum is allot of fun and makes facing each new enemy a different challenge as their special units bring something different to the table.\n\nThis game is fun and I think its got allot of potential to only get better.\n\n\n\n\n\n","April 11, 2015","true","106.7"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","15","20","0","0"

Deep lore with a world that was very clearly, lovingly crafted. Incredibly balanced gameplay yet each faction feels like it has it's own unique fighting style. For example, I played as Dragonhold (small, elite faction with dragons) and fought a war against the massive Iron Barony (giant horde of orcs) yet managed to win because of several stunning victories where my ranged units outclassed the melee only Orc armies. My only complaint is that the economic side of things is simplified to upgrade the eco value of this province and now you make more money rather than giving you specific buildings to build or technological improvements like similar 4x Turn-Based games.

This game seems like a 4X strategy, but in my opinion the depth of gameplay is not worthy of that classification. It seems like many features that should be in the game of this genre are missing or not up to standard.\n\nPROS:\n+ Many factions/realms to play as, with different races/alignments, and many are based on historical powers/nations\n+ Tactical battles are fun, challenging and rewarding\n+ Easily Moddable (a big plus for me)\n\nCONS:\n- The UI is generally not aesthetically pleasing, and text gets distorted on many resolutions\n- Empire management is basically non-existant beyond pressing the upgrade economy button\n- If you dont have a hero attached to an army, you are forced to use the autoresolve, and there is a limit to how many heroes you can have. The number depends on the nation you are playing. Seen above, I believe the Tactical Battle system is one of the games strongest mechanics, so it is infuriating that we don't get to use it enough\n- Some nations are just ridiculously weak at the beggining of a campaign and are easily destroyed\n- Unit diversity, in both quality and art assets, is low\n- No income report, or anything that breaks down your finances\n- A very limited pool of magic that is firmly set for your chosen realm\n\nThere are several other cons I could list, but the point is that they outweigh the pros for me. I really want this to be a good game, but for now it isn't. As I stated before, however, I am recommending this game so other people can shout at the devs and help improve it.","April 17, 2015","true","11.6"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","2"

It's is not my usual genre, but I have played some conquest strategy games such as Civ before so not entirely a noob either. (Still pretty rookie, I know. :p )\n\nI have found enough fun in Sovereignty to bring me back for several games already only a day after release, and enough challenge that I had to turn down the difficulty level from Normal to Casual. Hardcore gamers will be pleased to learn that there are five difficulties in total: Casual, Normal, Hard, Heroic, and Legendary. I am hoping to go back to Normal after I get some practice and confidence.\n\nThe game offers variety. There are many different nations that are controlled by different races with different temperments and special abilities. Each nation has multple win objectives you can choose from at the beginning to increase repeat playability.\n\nSovereignty is in Early Access, so there are some bugs and the occasional crash, but in all, the game is playable and generally stable. Autosave saves at each turn (except in a tactical battle), so the crashes don't sting too badly. The developers are active in the community discussions: answering questions, accepting feedback, and released a patch to fix several early bugs after only a day of release, so this is quite promising for the future of the game.\n\nIn all, I think that Sovereignty is a good and promising game.","April 10, 2015","true","207.3"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"

Who ever thought of not giving them a good infantry unit please slap your self in the face. The game certainly has potential though and, I really hope they work off of the base of what they have and develop the game with more in depth as of now it gets stale quick.

Gameplay is solid especially for a beta, combat mechanics are fun and the world feels full and interesting.

The auto resolve is fair and the round system for it works nicely for both attack and defence.\n\nMy only complaint as of now is that the late game feels a bit weak.  Since the Ai's won't capture any capitol provinces (at least that I've ever seen) the borders and power structure in the world remain largely static as the game progresses.

(And when i say the graphics are basic i don't mean they're bad - i love most of the artwork in this game)\n\nStill in early access , so crashes now and then, but still worth every penny/cent. In fact there are many full release games that crash more than Sovereignty's Early Access version does.\n\nThere are many human kingdoms of various alignments, including one with dragons, two undead kingdoms, plus one vampire/gypsy kingdom, two dwarf kingdoms, two orc ones, one high elf, one night elf and one wood elf (though the elves are all allied to one another). Each can recruit different units from one another and have different diplomatic standings with other kingdoms.\n\nThe campaign map level of it is similar to Birthright (1990s AD&D based strategy game), though with more features than Birthright had. There are resources, trading with other kingdoms or just through the marketplace for resources required to recruit some units, diplomatic relations of all kinds up to full alliance (which allows you to recruit 4 units of one type that only the kingdom you're allied to can normally recruit), spying, etc. Your agents can even be set to work to improve another kingdom's attitude towards you, or to try to turn one kingdom against another (though the AI kingdoms' agents can do the same to you).\n\nThe only thing it lacks which Birthright had is the option to do first person RPG style missions, but i don't miss those too much.\n\nThen there are the battles which go to a hex map in which you move your hex shaped units (just like 2D counters though the artwork on them is decent). The battles are a lot like those in Fantasy General (kind of fantasy version of Panzer commander or Allied General), but with some interesting additions (e.g when more than one unit of shield armed infantry from the same side are adjacent to one another at the end of a turn they form Shield Wall, greatly increasing their defence against enemy attacks).\n\nOn top of that there are heroes (which include some mages) who act pretty much like Battle Cards that you can play once per battle if the hero is present in the army involved (though with experience some get two different abilities)\n\nAnd there are spells at the campaign level which do all kind of things, with some unique to each kingdom.\n\nThere are a few things that arent quite right (trolls and ogres and wyverns with zero defence for instance), but those might be changed in later versions, and there will be plenty of mods of it in time (though none yet).","November 2, 2015","true","297.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Fun to play and could be a very addicting turn based strategy game when ita hopefully finished and polished up a bit. Even if this were released as is right now I likely would still own it. After purchasing I found myself sceptical but discovered myself coming back for more.\n\nPros:\n-Diverse troops that represent a multitude of factions, yet staying simplistic to give a solid prformance to basic strategy concepts. Infantry, Cavalry, Support Troops.\n- Good variety of terrains to support the home turff of the controlling faction.\n- Appreciative economic system that takes time to develope but not overly frustrating to neccessitate micromanaging.\n- Magic system that supports the game, takes time to gather but does not give an uber advantage once developed. Each faction seems to have its own path and spells.\n- Dipolmacy: Alliances are fun to develope and chance to gain an auxilliary troop from them once its been secured. Due to slight differances in each factions troop you might get a troop with beter atk or mor mobile cavalry.\n\nCons:\n- Diplomacy: although some good parts some actions seem to get lost in the mix like convincing an allie to make war on a shared enemy or to send an ambassador to undermine there relationship. Tried many times but seems to do nothing so I have stopped trying.\n- Naval Warefare: Absolutely abysmal. Hopefully this is still in progress of developement. Personnaly I could do nothing but wait for an enemy to be intercepted during there turn. Never was able to make a calculated attack on the enemy. At times an ally would occupy my naval yard and completely delete my ships there bcause there is no program function to switch between the two forces. By late game there is an inability to move much of anywhere bc you cant attack things and you every nation has troop ships occupying almost every space in the sea.\n-Art work ia nice but could use a little more variety instead of just name and stat changes for the different empires. Still good but nothing to rave about.\n-Campaign objectives offer good variety of game play but some are a bit far reaching requiring the perfect condition to succeed. My experiance thus far has been Myrmont needing my two rivals to be minor powers. One rival having only one region and no economy or troops still somehow manages to be more than a minor power. Seriously?\n-Free Market: Resources for troop types is cool but the market seems to be stuck in poor or worse conditions. Anyone seeking to capitalize of fluctuating market price and use their strength of of a shrewd trader will be sorely disappointed.\n\nAll in all, good game and happy to have in collection. Hope to see it improve in its maechanics much more as it developes.","May 8","true","100.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I'm not going to add anything to this and just go straight into what the Dev's need to do to make it even better.\n\nImprovements:\n\n-Please add more art for the different nations units instead of using the same for many. Keep the pictures unique.\n-improve a.i. A lot of the time the a.i. units just sit in the middle of the strategic map and wander to the northern part of the map until turn timer is over.\n-need to fix the u.i. it has to be more intuitive\n-when mousing over different provinces on main map the only info available is revolt% you can use the extra space to fill in with additional owner information including relations etc\n-CHARGING units---not using ability in swamps, mountains and forests please...makes no sense\n-Maybe add a face to the ruling nations..makes it more personal..1 unique unit representing the monarchs of each nation with different abilities...leave it only able to  garrison capital province.\n\nI know they are currently in Beta but the game needs to be touched up a bit more before release.\n\n1 more thing...please fix the crashing to desktop.

Though having played it, I really wish that I'd waited until it was on sale.  It's not that the game is bad per say, on the contrary it's really quite good.  Albeit not as good as what I thought it would.\n\nWhat I was expecting was a limited, not quite there, fantasy version of a total war game.  Instead it's more like upgraded version of Risk, which wouldn't be a bad thing if the game didn't cost £18.99, and promised to be so much more.  Of course it's still an Early Access game, so hopefully they'll flesh the game out some more.\n\nSo reasons to get the game?  It's modable.  This appears to be the main selling point of the game.  You can modify everything from the campaign map, to the factions, their units and so on.  I personally think that this is fantastic, and that more games should follow suit.  Unfortunately, this considerable degree of modability is what leads to the games greatest downfall.\n\nSince it's expected that you'll eventually mod out the old campaign map, factions and units, in place of your own creations.  There exists a serious lack of narrative to drive the player through the campaign, which is made exasperatingly worse by a complete lack of background for everything.  The only information that you'll be given is a basic description about each faction and a few Province descriptions.  Nothing else is explained, which would be fine if you immediately wanted to jump straight into creating and modding your own content into the game, otherwise tough luck.\n\nIf you can overlook that appropriately sized hurdle, then it's a pretty good game.  Of course if you have no intention of modding the game, then you may wish to skip over this title.  The lack of background and narrative makes the game generic enough that you wouldn't miss out on anything that you couldn't get from your average Total War game.\n\nSo that leaves the price.  I would wait until the game is 50-60% off before laying down your money, since there isn't enough content by itself to keep you entertained for long.  Requiring considerable work either on your own or another modders part to keep the game interesting and viable.","May 31, 2015","true","83.9"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","0"

I rarely give anything a 1. 5 means "Perfection," and nothing is perfect, so you will probably never see me rate a game as 5. The "mid-point" on my rating scale is 3, which is sorta like a "B" in school. As the game stands now, I rate it a 2. That means "Below Average" or "Does Not Meet" my expectations. I will revise my rating in future. Presently, I cannot Recommend this game for the typical or casual player.

If the map screenshots above do anything for you, you're in the right place.\n\nThe Good:\n- Fun and engaging (this is why we play games, yes?)\n- Overall simple and deep mechanics\n- Sense of "empire" is supported at several levels. You do feel like an emperor of a vast kingdom.\n- Reasonable level of micromanagement; I don't get a sense of tedium from most gameplay.\n- Tactical combat is nicely done; I'll only auto-out of battles if it's completely lopsided\n- Aesthetics create a nice tone\n- Tool tips everywhere you want them\n- Tutorial is short and effective, if moderately "hunt-and-pecky"\n\nThe Bad (I.e. what I hope Early Access addresses):\n- Only crash I had was trying to launch in 3440x1440; game was stuck loading.

We'll see.\n- Replayability - you can pick any faction and a handful of victory conditions, but it seems the start of the map is static.

Few problems to the developers though.\nFor problems that have a bug report fixed to them I will leave but few problems I had. Playing as Maledor My heroes sometimes disappear completley, 2 of my agents are eternaly damned to the 'Agent will return in -1 turn' and that was 10 turns ago. After I ost a few units from disbanding  I checked how many units I had to attack Galleni and one of them was Inquisitor. I attacked Galeni but all my forces got there except for teh Inquisitor. he has now dissapeared from the eather.\n\nMore basic problem is if I got to Esc and ask to Quit to main menu WHOLE GAME CRASHES. Along with auto save files. done in last 10 or so minutes.\n\nLittle things that arent broken but just niggly. If an AI race asks for a peace treaty or asks you to sweeten the deal I think you need to give the availability to change the deal you asked for without having to get agent to come back (1 turn to return) then 1 turn to send him back provided they are on your boarder. Its incredibly annoying to have to use an agent to go off come back then go off again and wastes so much time. Considering the AI race you are dealing with ALSO has to send an agent cant you just tell their agent the new deal? Small petty things but would make diplomacy much less frustrating.\nAnd Heroes how do you use Heroes I can never use them.\n\nOk enough of the problems what about the game? I found it original, bit ponderous but well worth it. For you fans of Total War I msut stop you there, forget all you learned with Total War not all Realsm, counties you grab from other players neccessarily make money. I grabbed Risens (The Boar banner) land and found I increased my land mass by 50%...money stayed the same...because the three land grabs i made make 0 money and have between 0 to 2 economic points. 3 and above make money if not lots.\n\nBe tactical if there is a choice between land that has a resource but is under 2 econmoic points and another land mass that has up above 3 economic points but amssive defensive army stick with the resource. You can only sell resource manually.\n\nWhen creating units sometime you just need money to create a unit and 1 turn usually the cannon fodder of your army. For instance justicar (massive armoured tank of a garrison) needs 1 gem (no idea why) and 2 iron (ok for the armour thats reasonable.) But some units liek Maledors Inquisior (Magician) needs 2 wine....asumadley to get drunk at the college frat you sent him to and get laid so when he leaves he knows the ways of a spell weilder....i assume. A Necromancer needs 1 salt 3 alchemey etc. Harpie need 1 stone and money...etc etc. Keep that in mind. And the market place is annoying. You can sell alchemey for 79 gold but if you want to buy it back from the market place it'll cost 259 or so (in the two hunders at least.) This is just an ♥♥♥♥ so when another AI player asked me to give him 3 alchemey for 34 salt I jumped at the offer. Its a rare offer.\n\nI am fooloishly starting as Maledor an evil alligned magicians cult. Only has 3 agents and 2 land masses to start with but has ALchemey to sell. It plays far differently as I have left the GREAT WORM a monstrous entity to singly defend a land mass and seen it see of 18 foot soldiers justicars and archers as it is a defence only creature and you cannot use it to attack other enemy/ally provinces. Takes a while to get used to but all in all a fun game. I advise starting with Bouldard empire or Iron Barony or Zhazaroouth etc someone with massive land mass. Until you get used to teh game.\n\nWell hope you buy it and hope the developers read this and fix the more major issues.","April 18, 2015","true","47.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

This definitely makes the game feel 'alive' and give a good immersion of interaction that's probably the best characteristic from this game. However the deep administration of the game is lacking at current stage, for example it's not possible to set taxes, to make slaves, to built your own economy.\n\nThe AI always seems to give a good amount of gold from transactions, even some 'free' gold for non aggression pact, which some times they automatically break after receiving the offer and accepting the offer, leading to be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ with you for 'breaking the deal.' Also the AI doesn't seems to care so much if they're a minor power with small amount of provinces, and they're facing a faction which already destroyed 3 realms, managed to grown from a minor power into a great power and had the biggest amount of cities in the game, instead some times they'll declare war to get their asses beaten and give you some free land and a lot annoying time from unwanted/ unnecessary battles, but if they're pre definite to ally with someone like iron barony and khazoth, they'll do until the ending of the game or one of those factions being destroyed, so they're loyal and lore friendly on this aspect.\n\nThe combat system is okish, but since the game focus way too much on this aspect (what, they want compete against rome total war, or better strategy games out there, really?), the amount of battles will eventually become too often and too pointless since the AI truly sucks terrible, and once you expand they'll declare war for no reason, because who knows what pre programmed rolling dice programs which can't do things for their own, and needs to follow a list of commands would do, not best things definitely.\n\nThe sound tracks feels appropriate, I do enjoy mostly the ones from the map screen, the one to battles is also "okish," they could at least add more audio into combats, however some sound effects for some units, are at least questionable, such the one for Wraith, and a few others that I've heard from my playthough.\n\nAfter the update from 1.3 (which I didn't get any crash) to 1.5 after defeating Handrigel, my game is crashing almost every turn, which is very annoying. Can you imagine defeat a full stack of 20 units on manual combat, then defeat another 20 units and my game crash afterwards? Those pointless battles were way too often, and being repeat is just... Unpleasant.\n\nMy overall score veredict is... I see a good potential to deliver a fair good, but in my opinion they should focus more into deeper diplomatic effects and grand strategy elements, instead of focusing so much on battle genre, since there's better games out there for this purpose. I do recommend this game on this state for someone who is looking for a new strategy game and have already played most if not all popular games for the genre. If you're a new player for this genre, probably you'll find more fun into other games. I truly hope this game be successful and add missing features as a form of expansion or perhaps dlc, and continue this franchise into a sovereignty 2, with better overall elements.","May 17, 2015","true","42.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Not as complicated as I might have hoped - I still want fantasy EU4 - but it holds its own and has a decent amount of mechanics to learn. Additionally, the unique campaign for every nation - even the tiny 2 province guys - bodes well.\n\nAs an EA tittle, the game does suffer from crashes, weird bugs (like zooming in super close on the map for no reason) and an overall lack of polish. If you can't stand things like that, well, this probably isn't for you.\n\nPros\n>Entertaining combat, both in tactical and autoresolve modes.\n>Great diversity in nations and gameplay styles\n>Relatively simple mechanics that are easy to pick up.\n\nCons\n>Many unit images are reused between countries to represent very different units, which can be confusing.\n>The diplomacy system is clunky and obtuse - similar to EU4, but without any tooltips and with way too many clicks to get things done.\n>Aforementioned bugs, crashes, and other EA sorts of issues.\n\nIt's a bit of a risk at 25 bucks, but if this genre appeals to you strongly than it's worth taking a shot - you're likely to find something you like here.","April 13, 2015","true","4.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

All the faction troops are very various. I like the battle setup and the mechanics of battles. The race card of Human, Dwarf, Elf, Orcs, Undead and giants is always a neat card in games, lots of various picks is always good. In fact i can't come up with something else good.\n\nNow to the negetive stuff. The game lacks depth. they should make economics more appealing, not just upgrading territorys with one expensive click. Put a building list in the game with a example of farms,castles,mills,barracks.. and so on and so on. 70% of all races are human which is kind of boring and the are op. I know that the game contains magic, but the magic is wierd and often useless. a huge annoying thing is the map. its hard to see all the borders of empires. a better political map with colors. and i dont mean the mini-map.\n\nIm voting a thumb down on this game, because of its simplicity. I know its early-access but cmon guys... really? you could have made something more before realese. Also everything in the game looks like it was made in 1999, which is no problem really but yeah.\n\nthank you for reading.\n","April 17, 2015","false","9.7"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","3","8","0","0"

However,  development is proceeding at a slow pace.  Beta launch almost immediately had a bug that prevented game from finishing the first turn.  The estimated time to fix this bug looks to be about a month.  Despite its promise, it is hard to recommend a game that is so unstable and infrequently patched.","April 10","false","52.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

You'll enjoy yourself for awhile, until you realize that if you invade a kingdom completely, regardless of if it declaired war on you or not, you take a HUGE diplomatic penalty. In which, every kingdom that is not allied with you, pretty much wants you dead. Doesn't matter if the kingdom is evil, warlike, declaired war on everyone, doesn't matter. If you take their captial, be prepaired to fight everyone, and this is where the game is broke.\n\nIt doesn't reward you for invading, it hurts you, in the worst way possible. I understand that, while other strategy games don't reward your efforts, they don't normally go out of their way to screw you royally either. No, no, leave the kingdom that tried to murder you alone, I'm sure THAT won't bite you in the a$$. Five turns latter, oh, it declaired war on me again... huh...
