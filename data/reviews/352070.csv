So basically like real life.\n\nIt's a fun physics fort building game, and it mixes things up with objects that have unique effects (catnip acts like a cat magnet, a lamp lowers the damage cats near it can do to your fort, laundry baskets hilariously fling cats into the distance). Due to the physics based nature of the game, there are times where I felt winning or losing depended entirely on sheer luck, but it's usually fun enough either way.\n\nThere's also a story somewhere in there for people who like reading and paying attention more than I do.\n\nOver all, I'd say it's worth a shot. It's got loads of charm and it's satisfying to put together the perfect furniture fort.\n\n\n\nAlso, here's my obligatory shameless plug for my Youtube channel, where we played this game:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ys7eQMP_lgY&feature=youtu.be&a","June 24, 2015","true","12.5"," 73 of 80 people (91%) found this review helpful 30 people found this review funny","91","73","80","30","1"

Sometimes it can be frustrating but after 2-3 attempts you will get it eventually, I like how the fort stays intact after a loss so you can make a slight change to try it again (infinite times) but after a win, the fort will be completely messed up, I usually just wipe it at that point and rebuild.\n\nReally the only flaw that I have found is that sometimes the physics can get a bit bugged, for example if you have 2 big couches beside you and then you put a few mattresses on top of them, you would think that it is a stable foundation but like 5% of the time the couches will bug out and start sliding away from each other.  I can't really explain why this is but rebuilding or resetting parts will solve it.  Not quite purrfect, but it's manageable.\n\nI hope they can continue to add content over time as it looks like I almost have my whole house unlocked, it would be cool if this game had tons of new stages later on.  It looks like you could beat the entire game in about 3-4 hours or so.  I see some users have 12 hours in the game already so maybe there is a bit more than meets the eye.\n\nOne crucial change I hope the developers make is regarding the grandfather clock item.  It reduces the cost of items by 5 minutes.  Let's say you have 400 minutes available, you put down all sorts of couches and pillows and whatnot to consume it all, and with your 80 minutes remaining you buy the grandfather clock [which has a cost of 80].  You will then have 0 minutes remaining.  But that should not be: since the grandfather clock should save you 5 minutes per item, you would think you have those 5 minutes back on all the stuff you already put down?  You don't... and in order to get this, you need to wipe your fort and build it again, starting with the clock.  So you always need to start with the clock, basically.  I find this unnecessary!  Just give the bonus when the clock is in play!","June 28, 2015","true","4.3"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","18","22","0","0"

Suddendly cats start trying to jump on you and, as any cat owner knows, trying to do something with a cat sleeping on your lap is almost impossible: your only option at this point is to build a fort using the furniture found around the house to ensure you can finish reading.\nThe following game is a funny physics-based puzzler with alot of charm despite its basic gameplay and short length.\n\nPROS:\n\n-the game graphics are cute and colorful\n\n-funny soundtrack and sound design\n\n-building a fort is pretty simple, trying to balance your pile of furniture is just as fun as seeing it slowly destroyed when cats lunge at you\n\n-a good amount of furniture to unlock and six different cat types help keeping things fresh\n\n-decent, funny story\n\n-once you're done with the game you can still play through a survival mode to unlock new cat/ furniture skins\n\nCONS:\n\n-due to the simple and somewhat repetitive gameplay I feel the game is best played in short bursts\n\n-pretty short and easy, I was done with story mode in two hours\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=579880358\n\nFort Meow is a light-hearted and charming game, the premise of having cats landing on your lap and having to build a fort to avoid it is as silly as it sounds and the resulting gameplay, while very simple and a bit dull in the long run, has enough going for it to provide a good amount of entertainment. The various object you slowly unlock all have their hit points, shape and special bonuses and learning how they interact with each other or what's best at countering a certain cat will help you immensely in building a good fort. That said, the decent gameplay is backed up by an equally decent plot where the mystery is interesting enough to make you want to see the end.\n\nI'd like to say that despite its simplicity the game can still be quite engaging, seeing your fort slowly eroded by cats while you hope that mattress will hold for just a few more attacks can be a bit tense and failing at the last cat wave will make you go "noooo!" as you end up with a purring cat on your lap.\n\nIf you're ok with its simplicity Fort Meow comes fully recommended and is a very good way to spend a few hours in a carefree manner.","December 20, 2015","true","3.3"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","0"

In this game you follow Nia as she unravels the secrets of her grandparents sudden disappearance and why there are so many cats around...And why they're so clingy!\n\nYou begin the game building a basic fortress from chairs and brooms, and eventually you have an entire house worth of furniture in there, all ready to ward off the cats who keep trying to interupt your quest to figure out what Nia's grandpa wrote in his journal the days shortly before this all.\nOnce you have lasted a few waves, you will be able to go through the house and take more items with you to build. Some may be more your playstyle than others, and some may appear to be amazing but in effect are less so, and you can be surprised by the usefulness of an item you thought you would probably never use more than once to see it in action.\n\nThe game has a gradual learning curve that feels neither too fast nor too slow, and allows you plenty of freedom in designing and building your fortress. The story is well made(Don't expect a grand literary masterpiece though),  and the art style consistent.\nOf course, no game is without downsides, but Fort Meow is a well-rounded game with the obvious downside of its length. It's a short game, as you can likely see from the time played in both this review and other reviews, and one thing that could be both good and bad was the physics in use. You can not perfectly stack up everything and count incoming cats. For some this may feel random, but personally I found it nice to see that you could not just turn it into a math equation and solve it before playing. For your fort to be succesfull, you need more than just theory. You need to have it made in a way that it still works if things -don't- go as planned.\n\nIn the end, Fort Meow is a good, if somewhat short game that offers you a few hours which are entertaining, easy to play, and rewarding to finish.","June 27, 2015","true","9.7"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","1"

For one thing its full of cats and doesn't stink like cat poo. Fort Meow is all about building a fort and adorable cats. The best way to describe  Fort Meow is a reverse tower destruction game. Instead of destroying it though your building it to withstand an onslaught of cat-proportions. You will use all sorts of conventional and some non-conventional furniture to deal with these furry felines. From toast launchers, cardboard boxes, to dart turrets, you will have to change your strategy to deal with these strange cats. The game is simple enough that just about anyone can play and it runs beautifully. The artstyle is adorable and the game screams family friendly. There are a few hiccups along the road though. Lack of a clear all button to get back into building quickly, multiple saves, and slight stuttering. None of these affect gameplay all that much and are easily overlooked. The game is simple, very fun, and enjoyable. With Steam achievements/cards and plenty of ways to build crazy Forts. The game gives you plenty of replay and is always adding new things to keep you entertained. So prepare your defenses.

If I wasn't going for the achievements (which I did end up having to do a second play-through to get) my playtime would have been much shorter.  If you're looking to throw away a couple hours on a fun game, I would definitely say that this game is worth the money.\n\nEssentially, you are a girl who has come to spend some time with your grandparents.  Upon your arrival, you find that neither your grandfather, nor your grandmother are around.  Searching for something to do until they arrive, you find your grandfather's journal and become enthralled with his detailed account of what he's been working on lately.  However, there is one minor flaw with reading the journal...your grandparents have some VERY needy cats who crave your attention.  To keep them at bay, you must build a fort and read the information that they may not want you to know...\n\nWhile this review might show a conlist that outweighs the pros, the game itself is fun and the cosmetic issues are things that can be overlooked in the longrun.  I would give this game a rating of 9/10, as it is a unique idea and was generally fun to play through.\n\nPros:\n- This game is entertaining.  The storyline itself was interesting and the side quests were entertaining.  I was not bored the entire time I played through Fort Meow.\n- The game continually builds upon itself.  You are tasked with collecting side items to strengthen your fort, as well as clues to chip away at the mystery of these overly affectionate felines.\n- Both the music and the art style add to the gameplay.  The music isn't grating upon one's ears and it's lovely to look at.\n- The random drops from the packages were a nice touch, giving the player a chance to hoard the items and use them when a level was too hard to conquer without the use of something else.\n- The creators were thoughtful enough to include Steam achievements and trading cards.\n\nCons:\n- You cannot skip scenes.  I do not like being forced to read the entire dialogue.  For 1 playing, this might have been an irritating quirk.  However, only having the ability to click quickly to speed along the dialogue would not be nearly as useful as a skip button for entire scenes.\n- It's short.  You can knock this game out entirely in one sitting.  Some people might like this, but it would be nice to give this game some more replayable content, like the last level.\n- The only challenging part of the game was the last level, where you must rebuild your fort multiple times while the battery is recharging.  While the later levels do try to increase the challenge of cats, I felt that the outcome was entirely luck based.  You had to have a little more strategy in how you built your fort to keep its stability.\n- It's a bit repetitive and is almost entirely luck-based.  I've found that by using the same shoddy builds up to 10 times, you will eventually get a success.\n- There was a lack of introductions of the new cat introductions.  I felt as if I was having various new cats thrown at me constantly and noticed that the description of the cats in my journal did not always pop up upon their introductions.  Sometimes I would have to wait until after the level had finished to read about them.  Having a notice popup upon each cat's arrival might have been more useful.\n- The inability to return to the certain areas in the last level(s).  Do not head past the Dark Room or you will have to replay the entire game to get the achievements.","June 30, 2015","true","6.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It is a fort building game with cute graphics and sounds, somewhat challenging gameplay that doesn't have much of a learning curve, and fun music that fits the overall feel of the story/gameplay.  I would classify this as a comfy game.\n\nAs mentioned in other reviews there is a bit of luck involved in your fort surviving a wave, and sometimes a build that doesn't work will suddenly work when repeating the wave just by how the cats hit the fort.  This is a minor complaint though, as the other aspects of the game more than makes up for it.  The game itself is not long, but I find myself playing it over and over just because the game makes me smile.  There are a couple of minor bugs I have found which have already been mentioned in the forums but they are not game breaking by any means.  The developer is active in addressing them, which is a nice plus.\n\nI wish I had the ability to purchase the soundtrack, and hopefully that will be an option later.  It's that good.

What I took the most issue with, however, was how the story developed. It promotes a pointless genocide of cats who would rather just be left alone to dream of electric mice, all for the amusement of asinine children. The grandfather's approach to them (that can be gleaned from the journal) is also highly controversial to me - how he treats them as disposable objects, not noticing a point past which they no longer were such. And back to the kids again - it's all fun and smiles for them while the (clearly at least semi-sentient) cats are fighting desperately for survival. The callousness of the whole thing left me disturbed and saddened, from a casual game I would've never suspected of influencing me in such a way.\n\nCompare this to Hatred, which is one of my favourite games of 2015. In Hatred, humans are the target. This makes it okay because, frankly, the human species has it coming. Cats however, are off limits (to me at least).\n\nThe music is nice (I like elevator music). The art direction is passable, though how they do faces (both of cats and humans) is just... ugh. The gameplay itself is quite fun but none of this is enough to salvage my opinion.

The idea is pretty simple:  your character is trying to read a book undisturbed, but the cats are determined to lie on your lap!  So you do the only logical thing a person would do -- you build a fort!  :-)\n\nFort construction is the meat of the game.  All around you, you build your fort out of chairs, mattresses, cushions, and the list just keeps growing and growing as the levels increase.  When you're ready, then you click the Defend button and you see if your fort holds up against the cats flying in at you from off the screen ala AngryBirds.\n\nEach item used to make your fort uses "points" of which you only have so much of to build a fort with, so you have to design and choose your parts wisely, and make adjustments for how and where the cats are coming from as that changes from each level.\n\nI found it hilarious just how much the cats attacked just like all the different varieties of AngryBirds birds!\n\nIn between fighting off a wave of cats, you can explore the house to pick up additional items in which to build a fort out of.  And this continues;  fend off more waves, explore more house...   while all this is going on, your character reveals the story of what's going on by revealing the page out of the book that was just read.  And I found it a very entertaining story.\n\nThe PRO's:- Fun gameplay.\n- Nice, cartoony graphics.\n- Very well made and polished.\n- Pacing.  New cats and objects for fort are revealed at a nice pace so each level is a little different.  Very nice.\n- Some very creative and cool items for your fort.\n\nThe OK:- It's a little short.  BUT, it does have Challenge maps after the campaign.

You're tasked with making a fort out of furniture to protect yourself from a horde of pouncing cats for long enough to read a diary which hopefully explains why all those cats are there in the first place. The game features several types of cats that do different types/amounts of damage and the player is encouraged to look around the house to find more items to use to defend against the cats. There are items that trap, repel or attract the cats, reduce the damage they make, etc. The game does not have any challenge modes or an option to replay levels, so in that respect its replay value is limited (although the dev has hinted that an endless mode or something similar will be added to the game). But it offers a fun and relaxing way to spend a few hours. I played it in the company of a friend and we had a lot of fun stacking up furniture and watching cats throw themselves at it.","October 9, 2015","true","5.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It doesn't make a lot of sense to get it here especially when it doesn't offer anything new, and is yet another example of a game that may fit one platform, but not another. Don't get me wrong, you can have fun at first here. But it's designed for quick play in mind and coming back to for short sessions: not sitting down and playing for an extended time. Pass.\n\nGameplay and Video First Impressions:  http://youtu.be/ms1aGspOsHM\n\nLists:\n+:\nThe initial gameplay is fun, with attempting to optimize building in several ways and the first few levels give some enjoyment.\nThe idea is cute and the cartoonish style does well enough with it to try to play off that.\nSome skill needed to construct based on numbers of cats.-:\nLack of variety in gameplay, even with the different items and enemies, catches up rather quickly. The game becomes very samey very quickly, which is a problem.\nLack of controls like the ability to rotate (you basically keep on dropping an item to get a rotation you want) really hurts when you have a keyboard at your disposal.\nThe game's increased cost on the Steam platform makes absolutely no sense given the lack of additions. Sorry, porting to a new platform does cost money: but it makes no sense to the consumer to pick it up at an increased price without some kind of new item to go with it.\nLack of direction with lightbulb portion gets on nerves.\nDesigned for mobile platform: and it shows. Gameplay doesn't do well outside of that medium.","June 25, 2015","false","2.2"," 21 of 45 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","21","45","0","2"

It's very pretty but at the same time slightly unusual (in a good way) and you can recognize that it's not just generically pretty but it's got a unique look to it.  If you saw characters from the game elsewhere, you'd recognize their art style.  I find that refreshing in a world full of pretty but very generic graphics that we see in so many other games.\n\nThere is a short but interesting story to follow.  I gobbled up every bit and read every little note.  Some people will probably just want to skip through that and play the defense part of the game, but the story here adds to the atmostphere and lets you see what is going on.  I would have very much have liked to see the story go in a different direction, but at least it wasn't super predictable I guess.\n\nSpeaking of the defense part of the game, it's absolutely wonderful.  Being a physics game, sometimes you will win by accident because of something falling over into a certain place.  But sometimes you will also lose when that happens, so it does balance out.  Each item has it's own shape and behavior and way it affects the cats and reacts to other items and movements.  During the short time you play, you will really get to know most of the items pretty intimately, which helps during one single frantic time of the game.\n\nWhile the game says you have "time" to set up, that's actually just your "currency" for placing objects.  You can spend as much time as you want setting stuff up for 95% of the game.  There is one time where you don't get to, which completely changes the mechanics and feels as if it should have been a different game mode, but it's not super hard and I got through it in a single try anyway.\n\nThe cats are incredibly cute and all have their own unique behaviors as well.  You will get to know each and every cat too and need to keep careful watch of what types of cats are incoming for each wave.\n\nWhile I love this game and definitely recommend it, I feel it's a tad short and probably should have been priced at about $5.  I was completely done in under 3 hours and that's with taking my time and going afk a few times.  While the experience is great and *is* worth buying at $7.99, I just feel that $5 would have been a more reasonable price point for how short it is.  Once it's over, it's over, there are no additional modes and not much reason to play any more again sadly.\n\nI missed playing after it was over and was thinking of it all night.  Usually I feel a sense of accomplishment when a game is finished, for this one I just felt longing and wished I still had more levels to play.  This isn't a complaint about the length again, but it's a compliment about the gameplay and world.  I miss playing.  I want to keep playing and it's in my mind thinking how great and fun it was.  I'd love to see an expansion or sequel.  I'll be waiting and hoping one comes out.","July 2, 2015","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The definition of what this game is exactly is a little bit difficult to nail down.  Part of me wants to call it akin to a tower defense game, but it isn’t, there aren’t really any ‘towers’ per say.  Part of me wants to call it a casual game, but it isn’t, there’s more than enough challenging game play to satisfy.  Part of me wants to call it a puzzle game, but it isn’t, it’s got a lot of ways to ‘solve’ each level.\n\nSo here’s what I can say it is for sure;\n\nThis game is a unique twist on strategic ‘base defense’.  The attacks come in the form of cats that want to sit on your lap and cuddle with you while you’re trying to read.  That’s right, if you ‘lose’ you have the pleasure of being treated to a kitty on your lap and a purring sound.  It completely negates the sting of any loss instantly.  There is a bit of a challenge in trying to get your base, which by the way is akin to a child’s pillow fort, set up exactly the way you want it before feline nemesis come and knock it down.\n\nThe music is great and fits the game very well.  The graphics are cute and well done, mildly akin to scribblenauts, without actually looking like them.  The gameplay is simple and at no point was I ever confused about what to do.\n\nAlso, for those who really want to push their skill, there are a multitude of ‘power ups’ that are actually quite tricky to use at the right moment.  But I’ve done the whole game so far without using one, focusing on building my pillow fort to exact details.  In fact if I have any complaint, it’s that the cats come a little too fast to use many of the power ups with confidence.\n\nI am blown away how much I, as a middle aged man, have enjoyed this obviously child’s game.  But I can tell I’m going to be putting quite a few hours in on this one.\n","January 25","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

During exploration, you can spend battery power that you collect during the attack phase to unlock additional fort building materials like TVs and lamps. During building, you can use unlocked materials to build your own fort. You need to stack the objects up around your character(s) in order to protect them from the cats that fly at them during the attack phase.\n\nI got about 3 hours out of the main story and unlocked a Challenger mode, but I'm not sure how much replayability the game has so far. Overall I had fun with the game and would say it was worth the couple of dollars I payed for it on sale.","January 26","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Just be sure you're okay with it being silly instead of a serious engineering simulation.\n\nThe Good:\nIt is more cerebral than it might appear.  Most items do something other than take a beating, and you need to think about how the fort will collapse over time to cause it to intercept enemies effectively.\nThe Bad:\nThe physics engine is non-deterministic.  The same exact fort (the game restores your build if it crumbles) may fail one time, and succeed another, depending on your luck.  This is the only thing keeping the game from being played more seriously.\nThe ‘active defenses’ (like the toaster that fires toast at random intervals in random arcs) are too slow, unpredictable, and costly to be of much use.  That's a pity, because several are fun to play with.\nThe tightly timed last level is more frustrating than fun.  The clunky controls are normally fine, but really make this level hard to beat.\nI felt a bit sorry for the stolen animals and robot cats in the end.  Grandpa doesn't seem so nice.","January 18","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I found the gameplay to be quite fun.\n\nThe long: a charming and entertaining little game. You construct a physics-based pillow fort out of varrious house-hold items to defend yourself against waves of relentless cats. There is a wide varriety of construction matterials, all of which varry in shape, size, and armor/health, and many of which have added bonuses or abilities, such as the Lamp, which reduces damage done to materials next to it, or the Pot of Catnip, which magneticly draws cats to it, redirecting them from more fragile targets.\nThe cats attacking you are likewise varried, which adds to the strategy. When you have limited resourses, do you fortify the sides against the bull-rushing melon cats, or do you invest in bubble machines to defend against the incoming tiny cat swarm?
