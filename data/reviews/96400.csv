Had I realized these two features were missing, I definitely would not have bought this game. But it didn't occur to me to actually research whether they were removing features for the PC version... I learned a lesson there.\n\nFrom the devs on their forums: "Regarding gamepads - the game plays waaaay better with mouse/keyboard so we elected to not support gamepads."\n\nThe lack of local co-op means you can only play multiplayer online, despite the original game being designed around having up to four players sitting around a TV at once. That feature is probably gone due to the PC version's controls. They added a keyboard+mouse control scheme, but completely removed any option to even use a gamepad. The keyboard controls aren't especially bad or really hard to use, but for an arcade-style shooter/platformer, gamepad is what I'm always going to prefer.","April 7, 2012","false","0.7"," 38 of 53 people (72%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","72","38","53","2","4"

While battling the pesky pieces of scrap I come across many more weapons and gear to help me become more destructive and cause lots of more mayhem. This is my long mission of harder and harder destinations to save humanity and rid the world of worthless scrap metal.\n\nShoot Many Robots is a 2D shooter, with 4player co-op where you try to survive thousands of drive you crazy robots, while leveling up, collecting bolts to buy bigger and better weapons and gear to help you throughout this difficult task. There are three difficulties to make your way through which have an assortment of levels you earn a star rating. There is only a small variety in the stages in the whole game so you will be seeing the same scenery a lot but just under harder conditions. Stage types are get to the end of stage with only flag at end or some with a boss, and survival style where you go through rounds.\n\nGraphics and design wise I really liked it. It was filled with humorous gear like a baby stroller that you carried on your back, a gun holster with no pants, or a space helmet. Each one had certain attributes to help or hurt you. Guns ranged between the standard fare of machine guns, flame throwers, pistols, and rocket launchers. You were able to equip a main weapon, secondary, head, backpack, and pants. This gives you lots of variety and can turn out pretty funny.\n\nGameplay was fantastic and very challenging. I made it through all the normal and hard difficulties but had to give up after a few insane levels since those are made for co-op play. There is no story to worry about just one you create. I only had two issues with this game which was the dead online community and no controller support. It takes some getting used to paying with keyboard & mouse.\n\nI recommend playing this game as it can be a lot of fun especially if you have some friends to play it with. If you don’t own it yet you can find it pretty cheap quite often too so don’t miss out on this one.\n\nBear Rating 8/10\n","October 25, 2013","true","24.3"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","20","23","0","0"

Hunting for loot is addictive and the game itself is filled with humor. Much of the loot is silly in nature and every item has a description with some kind of joke or pop culture reference in it (the series of freeze rays contains modified lyrics to "Ice, Ice, Baby," for example), so there feels like there's always another neat treasure to uncover, even if it's an item you'll never actually use.\n\nShoot Many Robots succeeds in being highly fun. Apart from some minor annoyances in the inventory system and difficulty balance, its challenge, sense of humor and deep customization options make for a great game with long legs and huge potential for future expansion with DLC. Old school shooter fans should take heed.\n","September 10, 2014","true","19.8"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","20","24","0","0"

Just be sure to hit a checkpoint after you pick the crate.\n* You can put on fishnets and said fishnets are endgame gear that boost your power by like 200 or whatever jesus christ\n\nCONS:\n* Besides actively seeking other people out, this game has kinda nobody playing it. This makes my antisocial tendencies burn.\n* Finding gear in the form of crates, especially lategame, is a chore. Apparently there are specific loot tables for each level, but that doesn't really help.\n* Insane difficulty has, true to it's name, an insane difficulty ramp up from the previous levels. You better be prepared and bring along some friends for the ride.\n\nAll in all, good game. Buy it. Right now.

A nice light hearted run and gun that you can enjoy with your friends while you share a beer or two. So when I found it on steam I immediately bought it, making the foolish assumption that it would support controller. It did not. I tried 3 different softwares to make my controller work with this game. But thanks to the cumbersome control layout on PC, none of them worked very well. The devs have paid no attention to this since the start and as a result I'd call it abandonware. They either have no idea how many sales they missed out on because of this, or they just don't care. Demiurge studios. Remember that name and the next time you're about to purchase a game by them, do consider if you'd instead get more joy out of watching your money swirling down the toilet instead.","June 22, 2015","false","8.6"," 16 of 25 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","16","25","2","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Soupinator/recommended/96400/","Soupinator","Soüp®: Legendary Edition","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Soupinator/","1293 products in account","Shoot Many Robots is one of the most self-explanatory game titles I've ever run into.  You do missions and your goal is to shoot robots.  While that sounds rather simplistic, there's a lot of variety in the game to keep you going.  There's a good amount of enemy variety and a mechanic that lets you punch to reflect projectiles.  Robots drop money which you use to buy upgrades, and new upgrade unlocks can be found randomly in levels, from various pieces of clothing to new crazy weapons.  You can end up in some pretty wacky outfits, like a giant sombrero with fishnet stockings and fairy wings.\n\nThere are a good variety of levels, from standard platforming levels to enclosed survival levels, with some decent variety in both types.  Playing with friends is recommended as you can easily get overwhelmed, especially in the later levels.  While generally well-paced, I find the balance to be skewed on the later levels on insane difficulty.  The problem is, you need the very best gear to complete these levels, yet you can only find those items on the very same levels.  It puts you in a very tough position.\n\nOverall, I very much enjoyed this game.  It's great for quick coop fun, just make sure you don't play with anyone with a flaky or laggy internet connection, because one person lagging will cause everyone to in the game's synchronous peer-to-peer networking model.","February 24, 2014","true","13.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

You have a character with a gun in a 2D world. You can jump and shoot and move forwards and backwards. Once you understand this basic functionality the game starts spawning enemies, lots of enemies. The games experience/money system depends on you maxing out your kill chain and keeping it maxed for as long as possible.\n\nIn between missions you will get a chance to buy stat improving equipment and new weapons, most of it which has some of the most ridiculous models you can think off. The ballerina skirt in particular comes to mind.\n\nThat is pretty much all there is to it. There are some slightly more advanced moves such as sliding and slamming into the ground that is unlocked with certain equipment but neither are really necessary unless you are going for high scores.\n\nThe multi-player dependency I mentioned is where the quality starts to decline, the game is made for 4 player coop but there is no system for playing with anyone outside your friends list and unless you can find someone to play with the game will quickly become stale.\n\nAnother problem is the fact that you max out both equipment and experience long before you've actually finished the game leaving you little reason to continue playing beyond a need for high scores.\n\nAll in all Shoot Many Robots is a fun little game and nothing more than that, if you have a couple of friends to play with it can be a great way to coop a little without the risk of a teammate ruining your day, for someone that plans to play it by yourself it is not a game to recommend however.","January 15, 2013","true","94.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

When you begin, you have nothing but a nailgun and the shirt on your back, and hardly any combat experience whatsoever. But as you play through the game, you'll gain XP and gather up loot drops to make your avatar dish out more pain with a selection of snazzy weapons and outfit pieces. You'll also come across stronger robots as well, as well as a handful of new models that'll make surviving harder, unless you took the time to replay older levels to level up and hopefully get better loot drops.\n\nIn the beginning, the game is quite a fun little romp, taking on robot hords while collecting new toys along the way, taking on each chapter with a brave heart and a itchy trigger finger before facing the final boss (Who will kick your butt if you don't move quickly). However, that is only for Normal Mode. Hard and beyond are not so much fun as they are a frustrating, soul crushing journey that'll make you wonder "What was I thinking?"\n\nRemember what I said earlier about how when the commuity took something with it when most of them moved on? See, when playing Normal Mode, that is pretty much the "Single Player mode" of the game. Anything higher, however, and you WILL need a partner or 3 if you are ever going to have the slightest hope of beating the higher levels, let alone survive to even beat one chapter of the higher levels. Back then, there were plenty of people to game with, but nowadays it is generally empty, meaning unless you have a pack of friends with you, you won't be able to take on the higher chapters unless you did some SERIOUS grinding, and got some really powerful loot to boot.\n\nSpeaking of which, there are a few issues with the loot itself. In the case of weapons, while there is a nice gallery of weapons to pick from, a lot of them are mostly just upgraded versions of older weapons. If you took out all the upgraded weapons, you would be left with a much smaller selection of guns to pick from, albit still plentiful enough to give you plenty to experiment with. However, depending on your situation, certain weapons are outright useless compared to others. Playing by yourself, you want to have a high rate of fire, something that tommyguns and flamethrowers can offer. Other weapons, like a battleship cannon or various shotguns, tend to falter in singleplayer because they are more aimed at support roles rather than solo roles, which is disappointing.\n\nWhat is also disappointing is the fact that outfits are not just for looks, but have some powerful stats to make your game much easier. This stinks, because if you wanted to make a Rambo lookalike, you might end up holding yourself back, and at some point you'll find it impossible to progress unless you dress up as a princess complete with fairy wings. In TF2, you had the freedom to wear any items you wanted without worrying about stats, allowing you to make your own personal avatar. Here, you can't make something that suits your personality, and rather must conform to what outfits give you the best bonuses.\n\nWeapons are not the only thing that repeats either. Levels tend to be reused quite a bit, let alone the enemies. While they do get new models as you progess, just like with the guns, they are still pretty much the same enemies. It even goes so far as to reuse the bosses you fight. Due to the minor RPG nature of the game, don't be surprised if you end up having to revisit the same chapters to grind for money, XP and loot drops before being able to progress just a tiny bit further in the game.\n\nIn general, this game is far from perfect. While Normal mode is a blast to play, anything higher than Normal you'll probably never get to enjoy unless you gather up a well trained party to play with and have the best gear money (or in this case, bolts) can buy. On the other hand, if you are looking for a simple game where you mow down hords of robots with a gatling gun, freeze ray, or even gnome missle launchers, I suggest you get it on sale. It is not great, but I still think it is worth experiencing at least the first 1/3 of the game. And if you have friends, then congrats, you might be able to go deeper into the game and see just how far you can go before you hit a wall of rusty steel.","January 9, 2015","true","15.7"," 1 person found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","0","1","1","2","0"

It will be very repetitive after a while. Also a massive grind if you want to unlock everything. You also need perfect gear to be able to beat the game on insane. The story... well, let's say it's non existing. The stlye itself is very primitive as well.\n\nThe biggest issue I had with the game is how aiming works. Basically you can feel the effect of the game being made for consoles as the aim appears to "lock", almost like a D-Pad mode. This makes aiming frustrating and incapacitates sniper and low speed weapons a bit. It's best to have some AoE and faster attackspeed.\n\nOne note regarding launch options - you must set the following launch option to avoid some ugly facebook integration that causes game crashes: -no_duckduck\nDo this by\n1. going into your library,\n2. right clicking the game in your list,\n3. select properties,\n4. click on "Launch options" and paste the following in there:\n-no_duckduck","July 29, 2012","true","49.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This game is a party when playing with friends or other people online. The sad thing is that it doesn't have dedicated servers so if the host is not close to you or has a bad connection it can really lag the game. The rank up system is really fast. The customizing of character and weapon loadout can be interesting. I ounce had a fish that was impaling me and somehow that gave me more damage when shooting my weapons. The combinations people come up with can be fun. The things I wish for this game is that the online was more active and that some of the achievements didn't require you to be playing online with others. But setting all those things aside this is a great game and can be alot of fun.

I haven't had this much fun in a side scroller since Contra or Metal Slug. It doesn't exactly revamp the genre, but it does have a fun redneck style atmosphere. The game got a few chuckles with some of the missions and item descriptions. Not much else to say. The character customization is decent, the levels are fun but can get a little old, there is a lack of a lobby which is very very annoying and probably the biggest flaw with the game. It gets to be a bit of a cluster♥♥♥♥ with all the enemeis shooting you at once so it can be a little hard to see, but maybe that's just me.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/excruciate/recommended/96400/","excruciate","Excruciate","http://steamcommunity.com/id/excruciate/","717 products in account","Take a wild guess what you do in this game...\nDouble jump only works half the time which is a massive problem on some fights. The last factory boss on hard mode took me six aggravating tries because double jump only worked some of the time and I kept dying in the fire since double jump is how you get to the platforms. I want to say ♥♥♥♥ this game and not even review it because of that. It is a horrible, unacceptable problem.\n\nA pretty fun game for one playthrough on normal and one on hard, however it is not good enough to bother with insane mode. Besides, the only reason hard was harder than normal was because they make you take massive dmg with each hit and make the enemies take more dmg. It requires no extra skill on the players part, just more jumping and more firing and better gear that gives more +dmg bonus. Both normal and hard modes were pretty easy besides the problems I am about to spit like a rapper spitting some dope ♥♥♥ rhymes.\n\nAt the end of normal, the last boss fight almost ruined it for me, and sorta actually does because you don't fight the boss. You just run from him then it's the end of the game. The last boss was horrible: I ran right and got to a box pyramid which it gives you about 3 seconds to ascend it or the boss charges and 1-shots you. After about ten tries I got it but then it still gets worse. You have to ascend more jumping platforming while he is chasing you up and one milimeter of a misstep means death. After about 20 highly aggravating unfun tries I beat it. But it sucked so badly because during the regular game, not including the survival stages, I died only once. It does not surprise me though because I do not think I have ever seen a single indie game in my life get a final boss fight right.\n\nThe games biggest flaw, besides mind jarringly generic guitar rock music that made me want to rip my ears off and run them over with a monster truck, is that it is probably the biggest cop-out offender of a game I have ever seen. It recycles levels and bosses over and over again and one boss fight even copped out so badly it just made the boss explode when I got to him then the level ended in victory. The last boss fight is easily a contender for the biggest cop-out in video game history. After about 4-5 hours of gameplay and killing what seems like tens of thousands of robots, the boss chases you and you run to the right and up then the boss dies and you beat the game. That's what they give you for a last boss lol.\n\nThere are three difficulty levels: normal, hard, and insane. I have beaten normal and hard and since hard was the exact same levels as normal, I am going to pass on seeing them again. However although it has been uninstalled and I will never play it again, it was well worth the cheap sale price I paid for the amount of fun I had with it overall. Not including double jump being broken sometimes.\n\nOther than all of this ignorance, I had a lot of fun up until the last boss fight. If that part didn't suck so horribly and the game didn't cop-out a lot and recycle everything, and double jump didn't work only half the time, I would give this a 8/10. As it is, 6/10, mainly because of double jump not working right and being such a massive problem.","June 8, 2014","true","7.0"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"

I played this on the Xbox 360 when it went free with the Xbox Live Gold deal, and really enjoyed it for a long time, then, I forgot all about it and went back to BF3, CoD, Titanfall... But then when my friend came over, we playe tons of FIFA 15, Ghosts, all that stuff, but after some time, we got bored. We looked in My Games, and saw Shoot Many Robots (he had played it a ton before too). So we played it for hours. I got so into it, that i checked if there was a PC version on Steam, and YES! there was! Hooray for me!\nThis is a great game, very entertaining, not hard to play, nor to master (just purchase the right stuff), and it's just so packed full of action and shooting many robots that it's just a wonderful game for the person that doesn't have too much money nor games, but wants a new videogame to keep him/her entertained!\nWatch out though, it's really addicting!\nHave a nice day and I hope this review wasn't too long, I hope I've helped you out on your decision of purchasing\n(DO IT!)","October 3, 2014","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Luckily I can have more than five words.  If you're unfamiliar, Metal Slug and Shoot Many Robots are surprisingly fun side scrolling shooters.  But in SMR, there's lots of different weapons and armors you can earn from killing robots, you unlock them as you level up and best of all, you progress at steady enough pace that it doesn't start to feel like a grind until you get close to the maximum level, ie level 50.  But there's one big problem; the multiplayer.  The difficulty doesn't scale properly when there's enough people, so ironically single player is easier.  Not only that but the match making system is very poorly designed.  You don't get to choose what game to join and you can only join the fun in between levels, so if the best game you can join has 1 afk person in a level then you don't get to play multiplayer.  But that aside it's good and if you can find it for a few dollar then I say pick it up.","May 24, 2012","true","25.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The robots represent the government, corporations and education, and the player stands for the budgets ( varying depending on the amount of players, the colors are important). When the player "shoots many robots" they are implying embezzlement in the system (of government, schooling systems, etc.). If there are two players (green and blue) it is the taint of the bloated paycheques of the corrupted police force. Adding a third player (red) with these first two factors shows the unheeded violence the police are payed to carry out for the government under the veil of "keeping the peace". The fourth yellow player is chaos. The chaos that the government funds and keeps cycling through our society to make sure we keep drinking their government water and buying their chosen government brands in their controlled, corrupt society.\n\n-Has good customization\n-Fun multiplayer\n-Very satisfying gameplay\n\nWould reccomend.","July 18, 2012","true","21.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You run, you shoot, and then you shoot some more.  Along the way you collect "money" to buy new upgrades which are as ridiculous as they are effective and part of the fun is in customizing your character to perform best to differing play styles.\n\nIt *DOES* get repetitive however and it's probably best to play only in 20 minute intervals so that you don't get too worn from the sameness of what you're doing, but if you're lucky then you'll have one or more friends playing along which should liven things up considerably!

As someone who loves metal slug, this game does justice to the genre, especially since you can customize your character exactly how you want to play them.  Unlocking will probably become a little tedious later, but the nonstop action in the stages I've played thus far have been amazing!  Items unlock randomly as you kill robots, and you get currency by killing robots, so it's not like you have to go out of your way to unlock anything, just play the game!  The game runs really smoothly for me, and the only times I've noticed any slowdown whatsoever is when there's something like 30+ robots on the screen at the same time as me blowing everything up, and it's nothing to complain about.

I basically walked through the first playthrough holding the mouse button and getting max ratings. Challenge was basically beating my friend's leaderboards. Quite some guns to try though, but after a while the appeal wears off. Mostly when you get the upgraded version of the automatic rifle that shoots in a slightly different pattern. Or when the next helmet you can get only does 30% more damage, or gives you two more health pickups, or when it's yet another one with the "Slam" hability, or any combination of the above. The enemies have some variety, but they never stray from... well, point your cursor at then until they explode, with the occasional punching back bulelts. Feels like you should be playing with friends to have some fun, but then it'd be even easier(plus, I don't see anyone playing this anymore).

The robots represent the government, corporations and education, and the player stands for the budgets ( varying depending on the amount of players, the colors are important). When the player "shoots many robots" they are implying embezzlement in the system (of government, schooling systems, etc.). If there are two players (green and blue) it is the taint of the bloated paycheques of the corrupted police force. Adding a third player (red) with these first two factors shows the unheeded violence the police are payed to carry out for the government under the veil of "keeping the peace". The fourth yellow player is chaos. The chaos that the government funds and keeps cycling through our society to make sure we keep drinking their government water and buying their chosen government brands in their controlled, corrupt society.\n\n-Has good customization\n-Fun multiplayer\n-Very satisfying gameplay\n\nWould reccomend.","July 18, 2012","true","21.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But there are two versions of this game - the console version (which as far as I know was released for Xbox 360), and the PC version. The core difference is how they market them.\n\nTo be clear, I do recommend this game - but specifically the console version; not the PC version.\n\nConsole's big pull for sales is multiplayer games, especially party games, and how the console version was marketed included local co-op and a pay store for additional weapons. For the PC version, they changed it so that every weapon is now fully unlockable by playing the game (no pay store), but removed two things that work better on console vs PC: the local co-op and the controller support. Instead, they optimized the game for mouse and keyboard.\n\nI personally felt more comfortable with the controller, and I'm a little irked that they removed controller support completely. I understand that controllers aren't a dominant accessory for PC gamers, but generally PC games that can be made controller compatiable have either partial or full controller support, either due to the fact that they'll be ported to console now or in the future, or for additional accessibility. To remove it entirely doesn't seem like a smart direction.\n\nAs a game itself, it has a lot of content. I think of it like if Castle Crashers had less of a story, but more items. The cover art and the title basically cover the story and the journey: redneck doomsday survivors battle out bad robots and to survive, they need to shoot many robots.\n\nAlmost everything on your character is changeable, allowing you to upgrade almost everything, or change it out for a different play style that better fits your style, or fits the level.\n\nYou can play the game single-player, but it works better as Co-op. At the time that I originally wrote this review, I wasn't able to find any other players. To get the most out of the PC version, you'll need a friend to buy a copy as well.\n\nI highly recommend this game, but as a console experience. If the developers decide to re-implement controller support and/or local co-op, I'd be glad to recommend the PC version.","January 1, 2015","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
