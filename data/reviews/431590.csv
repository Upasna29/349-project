And even though its on 20% sale right now its still more expensive than in the apple store. And as far as i can tell from Videos, Reviews and my own experience on mobile and Pc, there is no exclusive content for more than twice the price from the apple app store. Quite sad, that mobile games come overpriced to the pc marked and dont even get an upgrade.\nRefunded and bought on mobile\n\n[Ger] Echt schickes Spiel, aber für mich ist und bleibt es ein Handyspiel. Und trotz 20% Sale ist es noch immer mehr als doppelt so teuer als im Apple Appstore. Und soweit ich das anhand von Videos, Reviews und meiner eigenen Spielerfahrung am Handy und Pc sagen kann hat es nichtmal mehr Content als am Handy, wieso sollte ich also so viel mehr (bzw für Androiduser überhaupt) Geld ausgeben? Es ist echt schade zu sehen, wie Handyspiele derzeit total überteuert auf den Pc Markt kommen und dann nichtmal mehr Inhalt kriegen.\nZurrück gegeben und aufm Handy gekauft.","May 10","false","0.5"," 84 of 103 people (82%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","82","84","103","4","8"

Yes this has more content but you could just go play 3-7. So after all that I would not recommend paying money on this, unless they add some features that differ from the websions heavily.\n\nThis game isn't anything amazing but it is fun. At the start it seemed pretty straight forward and before I knew it I was trying to perfect my run and make that money to make my car better. I would recommend this game. Its a simple yet entertaining game, I would like to see leader boards or a ghost mode of your friends bets runs.\n\nHere is a video to see it a bit more indepth before you make a decision.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMbRKnpQ6w0","May 5","false","0.4"," 136 of 199 people (68%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","68","136","199","6","12"

Loved playing the flash versions, Android versions, and now it's on Steam. I also like the addition of cash crates compared to the Android version of Earn to Die 2. The game is locked to 60fps by the way, probably something to do with the physics of the game.\nOverall, definitely worth a buy.","May 5","true","3.7"," 42 of 83 people (51%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","51","42","83","5","11"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/matseb2611/recommended/431590/","matseb2611","White Shadow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/matseb2611/","317 products in account","Superbly fun. Earn to Die 2 is a driving side-scroller where your task is to customize upgrades on your car and make it through the next stretch of road, filled with zombies, crates, ramps, jumps, and all sorts of other obstacles.\n\nIf you fail to reach the next checkpoint, you simply go back to the Garage screen and buy new upgrades from the cash you've collected. The more you upgrade, the better your vehicle becomes. Once you reach a checkpoint, you then continue from that checkpoint and tackle the next stretch of road. Once you complete the full stage, you unlock a new (better) vehicle and start upgrading that instead.\n\nThe stages generally get harder, though they're all doable, since you keep earning cash after each time you fail, so it's just a matter of how many retries you need to beat the stage. The overall driving mechanics are incredibly well executed. Most objects are destructible and the physics are very realistic, which makes you feel good every time you smash into a set of boxes or run over a group of zombies, watching their limbs fly in all directions. The game doesn't waste your time. Every minute spent is a minute of wild fun.\n\nI'd highly recommend this game to everyone who likes fun indie games, even if you're not into driving games or sidescrollers. It will satisfy all those who have a love for tactical upgrades and those with a love for wrecking pure chaos and destruction.","May 8","true","10.4"," 8 of 16 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","8","16","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/awfulcitizen/recommended/431590/","awfulcitizen","Awful Citizen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/awfulcitizen/","447 products in account","This game is a time waster.  A 5-10 minute game to play at a time.  The object of the game is very simple, get to the destination so that you can survive the Zombie apocalypse.  You do this by driving different kinds of vehicles across a wasteland and enhancing them with better engine, transmission, tires and other things, to make your ride better and more durable.\n\nIts a fun game but if you play it for longer than 5-10 minutes you will find it extremely repetitive.  But for the amount of time I play it every day its a very casual game and its fun.  The vehicles are funny and the attachments you can add make zombie bashing a lot of fun.\n\nSomething very positive the developers should add at some point is Workshop support so people can add their own weapons and vehicles and or maps.  Would add more to the game.\n\nOverall I give the game a 5/5.","May 8","true","1.9"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"
