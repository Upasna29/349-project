I will review this from a perspective of a loyal Monkey Island fan that has played and owns the first three.\n\nA. Story - The story from Telltale games is okay but is kind of stupid is some parts. It does not flow as well as the first three nor does it feel engaging.\n\nB. Canon/Lore of Characters - Telltale creates characters that are like a spinoff and not true to their original personalities.\n1) Guybrush is now some heroic pirate who is known all over the Caribbean. Guybrush normal goofy childish side seems to have been minimalized now. He is mean and cynical in some parts of the game which is not like the original Guybrush we knew.\n2) Voodoo Lady is now some manipulator of the entire story. In the originals she was like a helper/advisor only.\n3) Stan - The voice of Stan is totally different than the originals and personality is totally different. Stan usually was funny and tried to swindle some money out of people, with arms waving everywhere through any dialogue. In this game he is not funny.\n4) Elaine - She is somewhat of watered down version than her former self. In previous games she was more independent and strong.\n5) LeChuck - Turns into some nice guy through most chapters then becomes evil again. The concept of him being nice is so outlandishly stupid or odd, that it just doesn't seem like the LeChuck we knew.\n\nC. Consistency - Telltale does not follow previous lore or rules that the first three games set. An example is the Voodoo Lady mentions "You cannot get rid of pure evil" in Curse of Monkey Island. Being able to kill LeChuck in the end of this game doesn't truly fit. Another example is the contradiction when Guybrush gets his hand chopped of in Ch. 1 but magically gets it back in the end. That makes no sense.\n\nD. Graphics - Telltale invented a more 3D interface. This gets really confusing and annoying because you easily can miss things. The original pixelated or even the special edition allows for a better visual point and click interface because the screen is more 2d and flat. The 3D characters look kind of ugly. The special edition of 1 & 2 and cartoon look of Curse of Monkey Island fit the characters and the story great. The 3D view of these characters makes them look odd.\n\nE. Dialogue - Numerous times you are given a choice on dialogues and which to click, BUT frequently Guybrush will not say what you click. This only happened a couple of times in the first three because the dialogue would have been super rude or inappropriate.  In the 5 chapters here, it happens way too frequently so the choice you have on what you want Guybrush to say is already programmed in the game to say something else.\n\nF. Interface - The first three games had choices like a) push b) pull c) pick up d) use e) talk etc. etc. This game you only just click on an item. You click an item and it automatically picks it up. It's like a toddler could play the game almost. This takes away from the game making it less engaging.  There are a few actions in your inventory but the amount of actions is reduced.\n\nOverall, it depends on your expectations. I played the original Monkey Island 1, 2, & 3 over and over numerous of times in my childhood and introduced them to my wife. She likes 1, 2, & 3 but for both of us Telltale Tales of Monkey Island does not feel like the original characters and story we enjoyed. I would not recommend it at full price nor do I like it. If you want to purchase it, I would suggest do it only when it is on sale like we did during the summer sale. For us this was just disappointing and felt like a new artificial story that was not consistent with the original series.","July 9, 2015","false","2.9"," 85 of 117 people (73%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","73","85","117","3","4"

First off though I’ll say that I can’t recall if I have played the old Monkey Island games, and if I did it was when I was too young to remember the game’s title! So I won’t be basing my review of this game off of comparisons with previous games.\n\nPuzzles\nThe puzzles are really well done, definitely what you’d expect from a good adventure game. Personally I enjoy puzzles that lean towards being logical and not being pixel hunting, and this game definitely satisfied me on that department. Usually when you need to find an item/ have found an item while exploring, you can pretty much imagine what you’d be able to do with the items. That doesn’t mean the puzzles are flat out easy though, it just means that you can fuzzily see how the solution would come about, but would need some more exploring or twists and turns to complete each step.\n\nControls\nThe controls are something I didn’t really like, you have to drag your mouse in the direction you want Guybrush to move, so it’s not as easy as clicking a point on the screen and having him walk there (certain highlighted areas excluded). Most of the time was spent “swiping” my mouse to and fro while holding down the left mouse button, which really gave my hand and wrist cramps (well, I was playing for long periods too, but no thanks carpal tunnel)! I tried using the keyboard arrow keys for a bit, but as they usual in 2D/3D games it’s clunky so I stuck with using the mouse.\n\nStory\nStory is good enough, none of it seems like filler, just quality swashbuckling pirate adventure! I really liked the character Morgan LeFlay, badass pirate hunter, and hope to see her around more! Other characters like the Voodoo Lady appear again and they are well developed as well. Bonus: so many innuendos!\n\nOther aspects\nPlaytime for me was roughly 4 hours per chapter, which pretty much corresponds with the time on HowLongToBeat, totalling slightly less than 20 hours for me. Voice acting and soundtrack wise, they’re both great especially the voice acting (as expected), though I wish they could have some more loops for the background music.","April 28, 2014","true","4.1"," 42 of 49 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","42","49","0","3"

YOUTUBE) but corny humor has always been a hallmark of the series, and at least it's nowhere near as bad as EMI's *relentless* references to 2000's pop culture.\n\nif you like the monkey island series and want to see what Guybrush and crew are up to lately, i highly recommand it.","June 18, 2015","true","3.1"," 23 of 25 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","23","25","2","0"

I just loved each chapter of the game.\n\nOh and no glitches.

The 5-part episodic structure seems silly and always feels to me like a cash-grab. Each of the 5 episodes is tragically short so there aren't too many puzzles, but  their solutions are as obtuse, but obvious as the older ones so at least it's being done right. The mechanics try to dumb-down the nature of point-and-click adventure as it forces the 2D characters into a very rough 2.5D/3D interpretation. I am quite unfond of the character models as they make it look poor, but that's because it's the same version of the game that was dumbed-down for mobile. The audio leverages references to the remarkable (not for sale) soundtracks of the originals so it's pretty good. The writing is adequate and brings in some really interesting characters, situations and concepts, although some of the older characters certainly don't seem like themselves, but that's the cost of being so far removed from the source. If they cleaned up the pointy-clicky bits and made the characters not look like beginner's guide to 3D, I would love this much more than I do.","August 4, 2013","true","2.8"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","0"

I started playing from Escape (bad start, yes). Then I tried out the 1st and 2nd games went they went on the iPad App Store. Never tried the 3rd one, but I heard some good stuff.\n\nSo after finishing Tales of Monkey Island, I can honestly say that I enjoyed it. The characters are still as funny as they were in the previous games, and the story, while a bit weird and confusing, was still enjoyable. The humour was still excellent, even thought they did get new writers for this one. Many references and small homages to pop-culture, and even the older Monkey Island games too.\n\nAnd to all of you Mac users, don't worry, the game works fine. In the amount of time I played the game, I haven't encountered any bugs or glitches.\n\nIt's a shame they won't be making a sixth game, since all the characters only agreed to a five-game deal with LucasArts (Escape From Monkey Island joke, look it up). But to me, this was a pretty fitting end to Guybrush's piratey adventures. I'd say that this game is absolutely worth it's full price.\nBefore I end this review, let me just say this one sentence...\nOh, how appropriate, you fight like a cow.","January 9","true","2.6"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","100","13","13","4","0"

I've played all the other Monkey Islands in the past, and besides Monkey Island 4, I enjoyed all of them.\n\nI will review this game from different points of view:\n1) CHARACTERS: Guybrush never gets boring, he is still able to make you laugh and give some funny commentaries on what is happening to him even if the situation seems hopeless. His wife Elaine is even more annoying than she ever was, and also this time she's one of the main causes of Guybrush's trouble. Le Chuck is seen for the first time as a human, and the Vodoo Lady has some nice corpse paint on her face. Even some old acquaintances have found their place in the game. There are a couple of good characters which worked well, like De Singe and Morgan, and the side characters also were well thought and hilarious (like the sailors belonging to De Cava's troupe). All characters were well thought and well designed.\n\n2)STORY: The story is "innovative" and well thought, and has some nice little twists in it which keep you interested. The fact that it develops over 5 episodes, though, makes it sometimes "slow paced", but overall the whole idea works very well, and keeps you wanting to know what happens next.\n\n3)GAMEPLAY: that's the main point which ruined the whole experience for me. Until the 4th episode I was able to manage everything by myself, without getting any "help" on the internet. Starting with the fourth episode, I had some troubles understanding the map the Voodoo Lady gives you to make the Esponja grow, and after some failed attempts I had to look it up to continue. The game also had a bug I could only solve thanks to a German blog, and some of the stuff I found in the fourth episode was pointless (the liquid glass, the wax, etc.), and made me loose a lot of time trying to find out how to use it. In episode 5 I got REALLY frustrated and had to look up for a solution too many times. I can say I am an experienced point&click adventurer and always manage to solve everything by myself, but this time the connections between objects and effect was "absurd" at times, so that I would never ever have thought about the combinations that were needed to go on. The whole going back and forth through the Crossroads was kind of an annoying time loss I would have avoided, and the "advises" the Voodoo Ladies gives you are not really helpful in finding out what to do next.\n\nSo, overall, the game was well done (even if there were some mistakes in the German synchronisation, and sometimes you could even hear the same guy giving voices to two different characters, which is never good), the story was nice and worked very well, but the Gameplay ruined my overall experience, so that I just wanted the game to finally be over in the last chapter.","August 31, 2014","true","5.1"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","18","22","0","0"

Do not expect anything "great". Take this as a B-rated-movie, which you are going to enjoy, no matter what or just leave it.\n\nI had a pause between 2nd and 3rd chapters so I had forgotten most of the story and characters.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/discrider/recommended/31170/","discrider","The Best Class in TF2","http://steamcommunity.com/id/discrider/","405 products in account","Ever since The Walking Dead series came out of Telltale Games, I had to force myself to consider that some of their games weren't complete tripe. With the rather disappointing Back to the Future and Sam and Max series behind them, they somehow managed to produce one of the best films/choose your own cutscene adventures of the year. So just recently I thought it was high time to get over myself and come back to play the Tales of Monkey Island, which was released after the two other abysmal series, but before the brilliant TWD. And to my complete surprise, it also didn't suck.\n\nThe issue with the previous games was this. There were very few environments within each puzzle segment, and the puzzles were so insipid, that a mere clicking on everything to find all the items necessary to complete the puzzle, and then clicking on all the remaining things with all the things in your inventory was not only efficient, but bore little difference to the puzzle solution itself. Basically, everything was too easy. And the parts that weren't easy were only that way because the relevant solution items were too small or otherwise hidden in the environment. Finding the solution items should never be the tricky part of the solving process. The trick should be in the deductive process.\n\nBut in this series, the Monkey Island series, it was. There were enough dead ends and pure logical puzzles and random red herrings that thinking was rewarded. The answers were always obvious when revealed, but not so obvious as to just be an issue of item acquisition. There are several aha! moments when the sufficient items in your inventory are used in unique ways to solve a puzzle which seemed impassable. And that makes the entire game worthwhile.\n\nAlso the source material is dutiful taken care of. The game maintains some of the charm of the original Monkey Island games, not just through references to the previous games, or attention to character, but through the style of humour and the use of narrative trees to expand on that humour. These trademark trees, where back and forth witty banter occurs between two characters without reflecting on story consequence or requiring progression at all, pop up from time to time and are the best source of laughs in the game. They don't occur as frequently as in the originals but they're still worth the price of admission.\n\nThe game is not without its flaws though. I found the last episode weak and unconvincing especially the final confrontation's conclusion. Not to mention it's completely missing the traditional "Guybrush kicks butt" penultimate chapter that was the final payoff to the puzzles in all the previous Monkey Island games (aside the story resolution). The second chapter was marred by hiding an island in the borders of the map, and the fourth by unlocking items in a previously explored location without due notification or prior signposting. But for the most part it steers completely clear of these standard annoying adventure game errors, so it is to be commended for that.\n\nMy only real complaint is that this was episodic. Because of this, there is this pre-baked structure in each episode of framing the big interesting puzzle with two smaller ones to ease people into the game, and then speed up the action at the end. Playing straight through two episodes or more, this puts quite a bit too much downtime between the larger puzzles, and that is unfortunate.\n\nBut overall, this is a good Monkey Island game. The puzzles were solid, the humour in consistent tone and quality (if a bit sparse) and the plot reasonable (or good up until episode 5). Still Monkey Island and Monkey Island 3 were great games. Monkey Island 2 dragged on a bit, was admittedly too hard for me when I played it and suffered at the end as well. And Monkey Island 4 was abominable for reasons I have repressed. So when I say this game is good, it doesn't hold a candle to 1 and 3. It beats out 2 in my book, and no-one chooses to remember 4.\n\nSo as an adventure game, buy it.\nAs a Monkey Island game, don't expect too much from it, but then buy it.\n4/5.   May replay on occasion.\n(Monkey Island 1 and 3 get 5/5s, Monkey Island 2 gets a 3.5 and 4 gets 2 or something).","December 5, 2013","true","3.1"," 10 of 19 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","10","19","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tarma_steam/recommended/31170/","tarma_steam","tarma","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tarma_steam/","106 products in account","TL;DR version: Chapters 1-4 were fun games with a few moments of tedious repetitive walking here and there, 5 was a horribly drawn out game with too many cut scenes and too much walking back and forth between point a and point b (with a point c thrown in from time to time for 'variety').\n\nI hate to give a Monkey Island game a thumbs down, I really do - but overall, this game left me feeling unsatisfied.  Which is a shame, because the first four chapters actually built up quite nicely.  I was entertained by chapters 1 through 4, and I was looking forward to the final chapter.  BUT that final chapter - ugh!  Before I go on to a part that's spoilery, I'd like to mention my two big non-spoilery complaints, which both boil down to: movement!\n\nFirst: you can only move by holding down a mouse key or by using awsd - and you have to keep your finger on the key/button or he'll stop moving.  Boy is THAT fun through 5 frigging games.  Oh wait, no, no it's not.\n\nSecond: like every five feet you walk, the screen changes to a new viewpoint.  And that new viewpoint frequently ends up being from another perspective or angle.  And when that happens, here's what MAY happen with your movement:\n\n- keeping your finger on the button you had it on may keep him moving in the direction you had him walking in this first place.  This is disorienting when you were holding 's' for down and suddenly Guybrush is walking right.  Removing your finger and re-pressing s will make it down, but that gets annoying with a lot of screen changes.\n- keeping your finger on the button you had it on may start him moving in the wrong direction.  You are walking down on one screen, you move to the next and he's still moving down, only now there's nowhere to go.\n- keeping your finger on the button may do nothing.  You move to the next screen which (miracle of miracles) still has you facing in the right direction, and yet you suddenly stop, and have to again remove and repush the button to make him walk again.\n- moving just a LITTLE too close to certain areas may end up with you walking into them, frequently interrupting your (six thousandth) walk from one end of town to the other as you try and complete a quest\n\nIf there's any rhyme or reason to when each of the above happens between screens, I never found it.\n\nDear game makers: if you absolutely MUST pad your game's playtime by making us go over the same territory again and again and again and again AND AGAIN (I'm not kidding, the final chapter is almost entirely made up of trudging back and forth between 2-4 points) - the LEAST you could do is give us back the option adventure games used to have of being able to choose faster or slower walking paces.  Remember Space Quest?  Yeah, I know you do.  Sure, you'd murder yourself a few times walking straight into something horrible, but at least you could speed up and slow down as necessary.\n\nAnd now for the complaints about the final chapter, which is wholly responsible for my reluctant thumbs-down of this game as a whole.\n\nPLEASE DO NOT READ ON IF YOU WANT TO AVOID SPOILERS FOR THE FINAL CHAPTER. PLEASE DO NOT READ ON IF YOU WANT TO AVOID SPOILERS FOR THE FINAL CHAPTER. PLEASE DO NOT READ ON IF YOU WANT TO AVOID SPOILERS FOR THE FINAL CHAPTER. PLEASE DO NOT READ ON IF YOU WANT TO AVOID SPOILERS FOR THE FINAL CHAPTER.\n\nOkay, ready?  So, the whole Voodoo Lady thing - what was up with that?  Oh, she's using us all.  You know what, let's just keep listening to her advice!  Well... okay, I guess it doesn't make a lot of difference, in that she doesn't really give any advice.  She either speaks in riddles that never actually mean anything, or outright says "hey take that thing, you need it, it does such and such."  And now that Lechuck is (surprise) vanquished (temporarily (surprise)) AGAIN, let's forget about going after the Voodoo Lady and like... killing her to stop her from doing all this ♥♥♥♥ again!  The whole idea of making the Voodoo Lady into some sort of quasi-villain without a MUUUUUCH better job of explaining it, or dealing with it in the end, was a terrible, terrible idea.  I don't mind the repetitiveness of Lechuck as a villain, he's funny, and that's great, but the Voodoo Lady thing just left a big weird unresolved mess at the end of the game.  Between that and retracing my steps about a billion times - oh! and staring at the screen waiting for Lechuck to punch me to the next place where I had to do something a billion times - it ruined my impression of the game as a whole.","March 8, 2015","false","3.6"," 4 of 12 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","4","12","0","0"

All the dialogue options that seem like they could alter the story are always the same one, no matter what you choose. So, for instance, someone who you are talking to mentions a pirate named Deep Throat. Your options go something like this:\n\n"Deep Throat? What a stupid name for a pirate?"\n\n"Deep Throat? Is my wife's mother visiting?"\n\n"Deep Throat? Isn't the throat wider than it is deep?"\n\nWhichever one you choose, the main character answers "Deep Throat?" and the NPC tells the only scripted line that is possible in that conversation. This is not an adventure game. Thos is hardly even a story, as the lack of context, apart from the seemingly imaginary answers that the main character gives out as options, make it a dull hand-holding technicolor 3D experience.

Bom, se você não conhece a série mas acha graça em piada com gordas, vá em frente... senão se faça um favor e vá jogar outra coisa.\nEm relação ao gameplay, também, existe uma decadência no sentido de que o jogo ficou mais fácil, mas também não é fácil demais.

Great voice acting, though!\nI liked the graphics, and the recycled faces and body types didn't bother me too much. The camera was very cinematic, a problem, when you are controlling the character and get lost because of it.\nThe puzzles were great. I admit I had to look up some, but the majority of them was a nice combination of logic and lateral thinking, in the spirit of the series. Inside jokes and references were abundant and really fun!\n\nMoving to plot and characters. Spoiler alert!\nThis Guybrush is definitely more mature than in the first games, but he's still a big softie. The Voodoo Lady still rocks. LeChuck had a couple of great moments, although in the end it boils down to 'he's evil because he's evil'.\nI have some major complaints regarding the character of Elaine, which is kinda there in all the 5 chapters, in the background and in need to be rescued--twice! (What has she done to the Elaine of Secret and Revenge?)\nThe new character, Morgan, kicks ♥♥♥--except she doesn't, really. Her whole reason d'etre revolves around Guybrush. It partly makes sense because of her job, but really. She feels down because of him, fights with his wife because of him, gets killed because of him, is cheered up because of him, sacrifices what is important for him... gimme a break. No, I don't think the hole 'childhood hero' thing justifies all of it. I just hope we will see more of her in upcoming games, she's promising.\nAnd for the love of God, the Guybrush/Elaine/Morgan triangle was so weirdly orchestrated. It felt awkward. I saw it as forced.\nConsidering the media today, Elaine and Morgan got a decent treatment, but I still consider it below average for my tastes. These two points affected my liking the most.\n\ntl;dr solid game(s), treatment of female characters could have been handled better, 8/10","May 24, 2014","true","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Guybrush Threepwood, mighty pirate, is played over five episodic adventures. The gameplay involves pointing, clicking, laughing, and doing many interesting puzzles as you go along trying to solve the mystery of the Pirate Pox.

Some solutions are not obvious, but if  you click through everything, and able to find everything, and run through the dialogue options you will eventually get to the answer. I had to look up the solution to a problem twice throughout the series because I didn't go through all the dialogue options for one part and I missed picking up an item on screen.\n\nI really liked the story, it was creative and interesting with different mini stories or episodes making up one giant story. The voice acting was what you would expect for this type of game (not as serious as telltale's walking dead). The animation felt like I was playing through and old school 3d cgi type show. What you see in the preview pics is all ingame footage.\n\nMusic was okay, sound effects were great, really simple controls, you can RUN which is always nice in a game\n\nThe only con I have after playing through this game is sometimes Guybrush can get annoying with his comments, but you are able to click through the dialogue if you click the right mouse button!\n\nOverall 8.5/10, but I would say 9/10 in the point and click adventure genre. It's really entertaining for a point a clicker.","March 24, 2014","true","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Great voice acting, though!\nI liked the graphics, and the recycled faces and body types didn't bother me too much. The camera was very cinematic, a problem, when you are controlling the character and get lost because of it.\nThe puzzles were great. I admit I had to look up some, but the majority of them was a nice combination of logic and lateral thinking, in the spirit of the series. Inside jokes and references were abundant and really fun!\n\nMoving to plot and characters. Spoiler alert!\nThis Guybrush is definitely more mature than in the first games, but he's still a big softie. The Voodoo Lady still rocks. LeChuck had a couple of great moments, although in the end it boils down to 'he's evil because he's evil'.\nI have some major complaints regarding the character of Elaine, which is kinda there in all the 5 chapters, in the background and in need to be rescued--twice! (What has she done to the Elaine of Secret and Revenge?)\nThe new character, Morgan, kicks ♥♥♥--except she doesn't, really. Her whole reason d'etre revolves around Guybrush. It partly makes sense because of her job, but really. She feels down because of him, fights with his wife because of him, gets killed because of him, is cheered up because of him, sacrifices what is important for him... gimme a break. No, I don't think the hole 'childhood hero' thing justifies all of it. I just hope we will see more of her in upcoming games, she's promising.\nAnd for the love of God, the Guybrush/Elaine/Morgan triangle was so weirdly orchestrated. It felt awkward. I saw it as forced.\nConsidering the media today, Elaine and Morgan got a decent treatment, but I still consider it below average for my tastes. These two points affected my liking the most.\n\ntl;dr solid game(s), treatment of female characters could have been handled better, 8/10","May 24, 2014","true","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I will admit I was really scared and skeptical about how it would turn out, considering it was made by TellTaleGames (SHUT UP NOT ALL THEIR STUFF IS GOOD) and the fact it took about TEN YEARS for a sequel from Escape from Monkey Island, the fourth game in the series. If you aren't familiar with TTG's previous work imagine The Walking Dead, but kinda ♥♥♥♥♥ier, and of series you've never heard of like BONE and Sam and Max.The visuals were phenomenal and had the same art style used in Monkey Island 3. I think only maybe once did I see Elaine's hot ginger pirate body skid across a room without a walking animation like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ bag on a segue. Maybe another couple times the lip syncing was off, but who cares? The voice Acting was just what I wanted, using the original cast and the same witty talk back attitude between all the characters. The dialogue was perfect. GuyBrush comments on everything he sees with the funniest puns such as " You Fight Like a Dairy Farmer" and "How Appropriate, you fight like a cow". You'd never hear that coming from a modern day game unless it was followed by "GRENADE!". I did not feel as though some of the characters were appropriate for the game. The first three chapters seemed very kiddyish and I believed that's what I would be playing, a game without LeChuck. It ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off at first because it seemed as though they threw the biggest meanest villain of all 4 prequels away and replaced him with a ♥♥♥♥♥ with a French accent who isn't even French (kinda like those Minecraft players who fake British accents to gain popularity on YouTube). But by the end of the 4th chapter LeChuck shows his true colors (being an aqua green) to have been, and always will be THE VILLAIN. I really felt actual emotion when I saw my favorite pirate...I won't spoil it. If you love the series you're first instinct will be to cry, before you realize "Wait, there's another chapter". And If you don't know the games all too well you'll be sitting in your chair ranting about how TTG stole your money, rather than just buying the last damn chapter for like 4 bucks to set your mind at ease. Anyway, the puzzles stayed true to the other games red herrings, humor, and creativity. It will take alot of brain power at times to catch the play on words and hints. You call it Dumbing yourself down, I call it comedy. The Easter eggs were fantastic. They were smart and subtle. References to the previous games and their run on jokes and apparently like a thousand others I didn't even get til I researched the game more. It wasn't just like "HEY LOOK POWER ARMOR THATS A HALO THING! LOOK ITS DEAD SPACE GUY" ( SHUT UP DUKE NUKEM I'M SORRY YOUR SEQUEL SUCKED). The point is, I actually felt like I was GuyBrush ThreepWood. I believed I was him. I laughed at every joke, I chose every dialogue option, I felt sorrow for every characters misfortune that wasn't ridiculous, and I felt genuine anger and confusion at LeChuck for what he does.Tales Of Monkey Island is by far one of the greatest adventures I've seen in a long time. I give it a 9.5/10.

There's some innuendo in it, but for the most part the humor is in the PG, PG-13 range. It's mostly light-hearted, but it is a little morbid at times (Zombie Guybrush was surprisingly unsettling).  The one only real fault of this game is that the character models all look like muppets and the muppets are ♥♥♥♥ing stupid.","December 11, 2010","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a comedic adventure game with puzzles that are not too hard, and features a slightly unusual control mechanism (WASD). It's also interesting to see the hints of what Tell Tale games would grow up to be in the long but well-directed cutscenes. It's reasonably entertaining and worth the cash these days, though to be honest i didn't really get into the story and was disappointed by the ending. A better modern adventure in the same vein is The Journey Down, in my opinion, but this is still worth a playthrough if you are an adventure fan.","March 5","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It still manages to keep you playing through at least once more, if just to choose different dialogue choices or check things out in more detail.. Even though it will almost always turn out the same every time you play it. Witty, zany, and pretty much an un-doctored and un-marred Threepwood experience. Definately worth a get, but play it after you play the originals as they're considred prequals to this story-wise. Downsides are that the modeling is just barely enough to get it by.. they're certainly not pretty and it could have used some cell shading or something. The scenes are usually gorgeous though. Also the puzzle aspect and the varied scenes ventured seem a little watered down. It feels like, throughout the chapter, you end up visiting the same places over and over. Especially flotsam island. This is probably more of a limitation of making the environments 3d and detailed vs 2d backdrops. The puzzles also seem.. less, for some reason, but still maintain that whole leap of logic thing that point and click adventure game authors seemed to love making so you'd call in for hotline help because of some vague thing you didn't catch. Overal, a great addition to the monkey island series, but don't play it alone. Play it with the other monkey island titles before it first.","January 7, 2013","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I am nostalgic for the old 2D, but I can't blame a franchise for wanting to try something different. I think they pulled it off okay.\nLength of episode was appropriate, I played it in short bursts over 4 or 5 days.\nOpportunities for Improvement     I am playing on a Macbook Pro Retina running Yosemite. I could NOT for the life of me get this game to play fullscreen. I couldn't even get it to play at a decent resolution, it would just flicker or be unreadable. Also, the game crashed on boot up every so often. However, I did manage to get through the game fine once I pressed command+F to shrink it back to windowed.\nOverall, I would recommend this game for previous Monkey Island fans. It feels right to hear Guybrush's voice again and be immersed in that world for an episode. I would be hesitant about introducing it to those not familiar with the earlier games.\n\nEdit I did just read that it did not recommend the game for Macs with an integrated graphics card... my bad.","June 25, 2015","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I absolutely loved them, even though sometimes the out-of-the-box thinking required to solve some of the puzzles (a red herring? Really?) was a bit much for me. So naturally, having loved those two, I figured Tales of Monkey Island would be lovely as well and I purchased them.\n\nI was very unsettled by the first episode because of the different animation and play style of this game versus the old ones. It took me a while to realize that I was unsettled because of how similar the style was to that of Sam & Max, another point-and-click adventure series by Telltale. They even used some of the same voice actors for some of the characters. Once I realized that that was what was bothering me, it was all fun from there.\n\nVery few games really make me feel. With these games though, I laughed, I cried, and I fell in love (literally to all three of those). The new characters, along with the new development of old characters (especially Voodoo Lady), really stood out to me. I was sad for Morgan's unrequited love, deceived by LeChuck's tricks, and very amused by Guybrush's discomfort with the Voodoo Lady's past. The puzzles were very similar in style to the old ones, and truly required some thinking. Fortunately, I'd gotten better at it since the last time.\n\nOne thing I also liked was how self-referential the games were. It was just enough to make those who had played the original games feel rewarded, but not so much so that people who hadn't would feel left out. Despite the fact that the existence of these games basically entirely negates the ending of the second Monkey Island game (unless you consider these to just be more adventures of Guybrush and Chuckie), I still am very glad I bought these. It is a very rare thing to see a franchise picked up so many years later by different hands, and to still have it retain everything you loved about it then. Way to go, TellTale!\n\nBEST PART OF THE GAME: They restore the visual for Stan's jacket to the way it was in the original Monkey Island game (not the sequel), so that his arms move but the pattern doesn't move with it. God bless the animators in this game. I missed basically every conversation with Stan because I was just staring at his jacket.","July 5, 2015","true","13.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I don't know if this is the right game to start with. There are loads of inside jokes and returning characters that the game expects you to know, and the dialogue (as always) does reference previous events in other games. This is definitely the one Monkey Island game that wouldn't stand on its own! Some parts of the story won't have the same impact on you if you haven't lived through at least one other Monkey Island adventure. The more games you played in the series, the more enjoyment you'll get out of this.\n\nWith that in mind, it's crazy how good this game is. My expectations were low, but this game should not be as good as it is. What you are getting with the Complete Collection is five episodes, each lasting about 2-4 hours depending on how long it takes you to figure out the puzzles. Generally speaking, the puzzles are pretty easy. You'll definitely not need a walkthrough to beat these episodes, but there's still enough challenge to get you stuck for a few minutes... Still, I wouldn't mind some harder puzzles. Don't worry though, the wacky Monkey Island style is still present, so don't expect any real-world logic to apply here.\n\nI also think that the writing in general lives up to the Monkey Island name, as well! I was surprised by how engaged I was and how much I wanted to see the story through. Good thing all the episodes are already out, because I would have gone crazy if I had to wait for a new episode to be released due to the cliffhangers. Make no mistake, this could have easily been a normal Point and Click adventure game rather than an episodic release. It's not one of those 'separate stories that just kind of fit together'-kind of episodic releases, and playing just one episode wouldn't leave you satisfied.\n\nSeriously, I have no complaints about this game at all, other than the fact that the ending felt a bit rushed. I won't say anymore than that, but you'll see what I mean. It's not terrible and definitely not a game-breaker, but... Yeah.","November 30, 2015","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game presents new characters, including Marquis de Singe and Morgan LeFlay, and gives a satisfying ending to the history of the mighiest pirate of the seven seas. Everything starts when Guybrush fails to properly prepare the cursed cutlass of Kaflu, used to kill LeChuck. Instead of killing LeChuck, he turns LeChuck human and releases a powerful voodoo curse on the seven seas, know as LeChuck pox. Now, Guybrush must sail the seven seas to find the mythical "esponja grande" so he can clean the mess he made himself.","July 8, 2012","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a comedic adventure game with puzzles that are not too hard, and features a slightly unusual control mechanism (WASD). It's also interesting to see the hints of what Tell Tale games would grow up to be in the long but well-directed cutscenes. It's reasonably entertaining and worth the cash these days, though to be honest i didn't really get into the story and was disappointed by the ending. A better modern adventure in the same vein is The Journey Down, in my opinion, but this is still worth a playthrough if you are an adventure fan.","March 5","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I am nostalgic for the old 2D, but I can't blame a franchise for wanting to try something different. I think they pulled it off okay.\nLength of episode was appropriate, I played it in short bursts over 4 or 5 days.\nOpportunities for Improvement     I am playing on a Macbook Pro Retina running Yosemite. I could NOT for the life of me get this game to play fullscreen. I couldn't even get it to play at a decent resolution, it would just flicker or be unreadable. Also, the game crashed on boot up every so often. However, I did manage to get through the game fine once I pressed command+F to shrink it back to windowed.\nOverall, I would recommend this game for previous Monkey Island fans. It feels right to hear Guybrush's voice again and be immersed in that world for an episode. I would be hesitant about introducing it to those not familiar with the earlier games.\n\nEdit I did just read that it did not recommend the game for Macs with an integrated graphics card... my bad.","June 25, 2015","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In the ending of Chapter 3 there was the whole time a sea cow swimming through the ocean and there were just the sound effects of what really took place. In Chapter 4 De Singe simple disappeared in the final fight while his turban and the syringe stood vissible but de Singe was not there anymore. I could not click on him neiter...\nIt's quite frustrating when youtube videos are the only chance to see the endings...","April 22","false","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
