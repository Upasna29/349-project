If you took lumberjacks and werewolves and threw them in a blender with Rainbow Six's careful planning (and executing of said plans), the frenetic and intense last stand dynamics and overwhelming sense of impending doom of the movie Zulu, and a hearty glug of Canadian folklore, you'd be getting close to what Sang-Froid is all about. It's unique, refreshing, clever, thrilling, gorgeous and has a fantastic folk soundtrack to boot. One of my games of the year without a doubt.","October 29, 2013","true","29.8"," 103 of 116 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","103","116","0","2"

Among the best games that I have ever played. Must play!\n"Atmospherically brilliant. Sometimes brutally unforgiving."\n\n\nAbout the game (minimal spoilers):\nYou play as either 'Jos' or 'Jacky': Two brothers, fighting to survive the night at their father's old wooden hut on the outskirts of a tiny snow-covered Canadian town. They are drawn together following the unexplained and sudden illness of their sister. She is far too unwell to be moved, and a broken bridge blocks safe travel to medical help and supplies. However, this soon becomes the least of your worries as strange packs of wolves begin appearing every night. You must face the reality that you and a handful of simple traps are all that stand between your sister and the evil that comes every time the moon rises. Plan well, fight bravely, and aim true, as the threat grows with every passing night...\n\nWill you survive the night, or will you be ripped apart by tooth and claw and malice?\n\nHelpful hints:\nDON'T save up all your gold.\nBuy the double barreled musket; buy the ~3.5g axe.\nHoly weapon bless your melee weapon asap!\nSave your  fiery hits for engaging enemies with a higher fear factor than yours, then keep smacking them while they are still getting up.\nDon't put points into ranged skills. Avoid ranged, it's crap.\nStay away from walls when attacking.\n(P.s. Using healing potions ruins the challenge.\nJacky (big guy) is way too easy)\n\nPro's and con's: [/u]\n-- Pro's:\nThe setting was so, so enjoyable. This includes the main map layout and design, and the geographical setting as well.\nThe story is great, breaking away slightly from the norm.\nLoved the survival element. No save-loading!! You either had what it took to live or you got ripped apart.\nSteep learning curb.\nGreat selection of traps. Each had their own unique function.\nThe melee combat style was difficult but rewarding. You had to learn when to hit, when to dodge, when to use your enraged hits. Don't think that just because you are swinging your axe you're not gonna get a claw to the face >:D\nThoroughly enjoyed the crunching of snow beneath your feet, and wolves holwing, and ravenous eating noises when consuming baits, and  the whole forrest of evil creatures joining in a chorus of howling when you died. It was beautifully atmospheric, but never annoying.\nThe sound of children singing or people moving around, out of view, during cutscenes or when visiting the village was some nice production quality.\n\nThe tutorials were informative and effective.\nThe gradual availability of traps as you progressed through the game was useful in not overwhelming the player, and also avoided the use of instant-win tactics, such using mass Fire Walls to funnel enemies towards your swining axe from lvl 1.\nSome of the voice actors were quite good. Particularly the Mayor, who, also played the voice of the Hermit, too.[/list]\n\n-- Con's:  In order of emphasis\nAlmost a 10/10. Everything not mentioned was perfect!\nThose f*****g walls!!!Avoid touching walls during combat, because it glitches the swing timer, making attacking enemies hit twice as fast.\nNeeds more weapon variants, and trinkets!!! Please, for the love of loot!\nThe MONEY!!! There is a steam achievement for having 15 gold saved up. By the end of the game I had 50gold!!! In 1858 50gold was a huge amount of money. If you play efficiently (for me efficiency is the driving force of my gameplay) you soon amass a ridiculous amount of gold.\nThere was NOTHING TO BUY by HALF-WAY through the game. The developers need to add some meaningful item upgrades so that players don't waste their time planning long and hard to efficiently fight the darkness.\nWhy?? are there so many empty slots in the vendors' inventories? That's just deceiving to players, whom think that they should save up.Either fill those up with new items, or REMOVE the empty slots.\nWhy?? Do the Mayor's House and the Church never become accessible? Please add more content.\nThe starting axe (with a holy blessing endowed upon it) will last you until about 16th December.  (Keep in mind i was playing the NON-melee guy) That is pretty ridiculous if you ask me.   You even get a FREE axe which is effective against all enemy resistance types on 20th December, I think  so there's no point upgrading if you know what you're doing.\nRanged was completely unviable - too few weapon variants - targetting was slow - auto-aim hindered headshots - couldn't shoot enemies already beneath towers.\nMelee too powerful, even as Jacques WITHOUT melee-oriented skills, and the level 1 axe.[/u]\nThere are a few 'invisible walls' on the map, which you eventually become familar with and learn to avioid, but which cause a lot of frustration when you get stuck. Eg trying to run over a small mound or between trees.\nCannot snipe from an overhead path - can only shoot enemies while they are on the same path as you.\nFew minor bugs, such as the Spike Trap (which requires 3 enemies standing on it in order to trigger) only hitting 2 enemies.\nThat f******g spike trap!! Got me so many times as I ran hordes of enemies over it, DESPITE me being an easy 5 metres outside of it's boundary. Please fix this bug.\nEvery now and then an enemy will drop aggro while you are running away (despite his friends keeping aggro).\nSometimes the Will-O-the-Wisps will appear on the other side of the map if you move from where they were when they went underground.\nOccassionally, an enemy will hit you while they are still on the ground.\nJacques (the trap-oriented guy) is usually forced to rely too heavily on melee in order to be money-efficient.\nFelt that the traps weren't really as useful or permanent as they could have been. For example, the spike trap (pretty expensive really) might have remained after being initially triggered, doing a further 10 damage to the first two enemies to run over it. Maybe an option to reset wolf trap. (I chose Trap Guy, but prefered melee due to traps being less viable).\nThere are some common fantasy themes of good vs evil, as well as some pretty standard tropes such as the helpless female, and the  evil guy in power - ie. the Mayor . These are a little overdone, particularly the way the writers make it very obvious whether someone is 'good' or 'bad.' Also, everything is black-or-white in the sense that someone is either a 'good guy' or a 'bad guy.' The writers could have brought in some shades of grey by looking at the human element of the decisions they make (  beyond the ridiculous reasons for the priest doing what he did, which seemed unrealistic and nonsensical ). Yet, you can't ask for too much from an Indie title.\nThe character modelling was a little poor in places. Particularly Jacques.. and the Mayor's chin :P\nThe was this blurry white glow on the ground surrounding the player, which looked visually unpleasant.\nThe blanket over Josephine would always jerk suddenly a few inches over her body for a few seconds before her rising off the bed a few seconds afterwards. This was obviously an animation issue, to avoid showing her lower half, but it was low production quality and could have been a more fluid motion.\nNeeded a 'don't show me this message again' feature to initiating a game with unspent skill points, and when you're low on ammo. Clicking it gets really old when you are saving skill points up for reaching level 14.\nNeeded to have a 'save current twilight layout' option, so that if you had to stop playing you didn't have to redo your whole setup.\nNeeded a 'refund skill points' button. Even if one-use only, or costly.[/list]","November 6, 2014","true","37.0"," 86 of 95 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","86","95","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tamryu/recommended/227220/","Tamryu","Tamryu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tamryu/","186 products in account","Where to begin with this one? It's a fairly unique game that takes things from various genres.\n\nDuring the day - You place traps in an overhead view of the surrounding buildings you're meant to protect. You can go to town and shop for a new gun/axe, buy some potions (beer), and buy ammo. There's also a church that can bless some bullets or your axe for a fee. You may also upgrade your character with skillpoints gained from levels. They range from using your gun better, having more stamina/health to upgrading your traps so they last longer/do more damage. The trap upgrades are generally visual upgrades too.\nThe enemies come in waves and each have their own path and target to the building shown. It even shows you the route they are planning to take to get there. Most damaging traps do not go off on their own. They are not place and forget for the most part. The automated ones generally are meant to slow down the beasts instead of kill outright. Placing a hanging net for instance (with which rocks are on top of) can only be deployed by shooting at it from a distance. To get the enemies to stand under it, however, you can place bait beforehand. They'll stay there and eat it until done...or die from your trap. There's also a spike trap that DOES go off automatically but only if 3 or more creatures are standing on it at the same time. Grouping the monsters together and making sure a lot of them go toward 1 bait/trap can be achieved by using a "fire wall" that blocks whatever path you so desire. The enemies that were going to head that way will now go a different route (the path will update as well) to their target building.\n\nDuring the night - You run around in 3rd person with your axe and musket. Before each new wave begins you have about 10 seconds to get into a better positon for the oncoming attack. Later levels this is important because the next area you might have to defend could possibly take you over 30 seconds to get there even if sprinting. Using your axe in melee combat is fairly basic and you can build up "rage points" that let you do special attacks. Using the gun, however, is difficult because this is the early 19th century. These guns are slow and take quite a while to reload....and you have 1 shot. The only way you'll be able to reload in combat is if the enemies are very far away or you have a greater fear factor than they do. Enemies grouped together (even weak ones) will not fear you (despite how manly you look). Alone, however, they will hesitate to attack you and the game shows you how long before the next attack. They also are afraid of bonfires (which you can place during the day) that you can light to give you a boost in fear temporarily. Then you fight through each wave until you're finished and it begins again the next in-game day. Failing a night will happen if some monsters end up destorying a building. It might sound simple, but in actual practice a fair amount of thought will go into your planning stage each day and then everything must work out as you hoped during the night...\n\nBeyond that, the story and the music's alright, nothing to write home about. Certainly could have been improved but it did the trick. Voice acting is okay too. Not great, but it's decent enough. The graphics fit the bill as well, but no more. The art style and UI was great and stylized though. The only other complaints I have about the game is that it's just not as polished as I would have liked. It's an indie game and they did great work, but preformance was just...all over the place for me. It never ran very well. That and sometimes the steam achievements didn't work. This is a known issue, but no fix for it. People are still talking about in the community hub forums.\n\n\n\nTo wrap this up - Amazing game with great premise and I really hope they're going to make a 2nd game. This is supposedly  "Tome 1" so I hope there's more....especially with that ending. If they can learn from this game and improve upon it in the slightest I will be right there waiting to give them my money.","June 3, 2014","true","16.7"," 41 of 44 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","41","44","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bhardiel/recommended/227220/","Bhardiel","Bhardiel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bhardiel/","704 products in account",""During the winter of 1858 something happened in lower Canada, near Wolvesvale.\nNo one truly remembers what happened, but rumor has it that the DEVIL came to town...\n...and that two lumberjacks hunted down his minions every night.\nThey were, the OCARROLL BROTHERS!\nWith solid PLANNING during the day...\nand cold EXECUTION at night...\n...they became FEARLESS!"\n\nThat's how the devs summarized the game in its trailer, and there's really not much to add to it. One of the best games I've ever played, worth every penny. Only downside I could think of is the lack of local and/or online co-op, though the devs were thinking of it for a possible sequel...\n\nThis game is a great mix strategy, action, rpg and tower defense genres where you take the role of the O'carroll brothers, who are being besieged by Devil's minions, which are composed of all kind of wolves, werewolves and other mythical creatures.\n\nTo protect each other and their cabin, they will have to plan during the day the strategy to follow at night, using their sister's foretelling powers to determine the number, type, wave and initial spawn point of the enemies that will attack during the night.\nWith that information you will have to set up the traps for them, and even go to town to buy guns and items. But one must be wise spending their money and/or action points in doing so.\n\nNight starts as a tower defense game where you have to avoid enemies from destroying your buildings, though you can(and must) take direct action and activate some traps manually, or kill the enemies which haven't fell on them; since the game also features wind, which can render useless all your setup if you are detected when least expected.\nAs for the rpg part, game features a complete set of skills to customize and develop your style by improving your character and traps in the way that fits you better.\n\nHave to say that game can be very, very punishing with poor planning and/or execution and stealth. It's actually quite challenging since you will have to set up your traps, then memorize the enemies, waves and spawn points in order to pull it off correctly and quickly under pressure and against the clock(not an actual timer, though the game is quite fast paced)...\n\nLast but not least, game's atmosphere and music are really sublime.","September 24, 2013","true","21.5"," 68 of 88 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","68","88","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/meatmaster245/recommended/227220/","meatmaster245","Brick of Death","http://steamcommunity.com/id/meatmaster245/","250 products in account","A very canadian game about two lumberjack brothers who must protect their fevered sister from hordes of wolves send by the devil.\n\nAnd then things get weird...\n\nThis game could be called a "Strategic Trap Defense Game" in spite of "Orcs Must Die!", only much more slow-paced. The gameplay is split in two parts:\n\n1. The Strategy part: This is where you place your traps on a strategic map of the in-game location and take preperations for the night to come. The map shows you what enemies will appear, where they appear and which route they take. There's a variety of different weapons, items and accessoires you can buy in the shops that will help you to survive and you can change your loadout as you like. There are, of course, limitations in form of Action Points and Money. Every trap costs a different amount of Money and AP and once you run out of one (or both), you have to get along with what you prepared. There's also a Skill-Tree. Each time you level up you gain a skill point which can be used to further advance your traps or abilities in combat.\n\n2. The Combat part: Where you fight enemies in a sort-of hack and slash manner and see how well your traps work. Lure the enemies in your traps and kill or weaken them and finish 'em off in close-combat. Your weapons of choice here are a axe and a musket, which has tremendous reloading time so you should reload it whenever you can catch a breath (you can speed it up by mashing the RMB but it still takes time). Naturally not all enemies will be killed by traps, especially since every trap only works once a night and the latter chapters have much stronger and more enemies, so get ready for some unfriendly close encouters. However, the game is never unfair and you can pretty much deal with anything as long as you're well prepared.\n\nThe graphics are done in a well-mannered and eye-pleasing cartoony style way. The sound works prefectly (no glitches or anything) and fits the aesthetics and the music is catchy as hell, especially the title tune is really addicting.\n\nThere are, however, some technical shortcomings I have to point out:\n1. You can't change the settings in-game. You have to go back to the main menu, basically ending your game, to get to the options menu, which is a really poor developer decision even for a indie-game.\n2. This is mostly a personal problem: Performance-wise it runs really unstable as long as V-Sync isn't active. Heavy frame-rate drops made the game run like a slideshow for me. Worst part is this really messed up my controls, I literally had to mash the mouse buttons so my character wouldn't just stand there like an idiot and letting himself get killed. Only after I enabled V-Sync the game would run acceptable for me.\n3. No Window-Mode, but thats no real issue for me. Just pointing out in case someone wants to know.\n\nApart from those few problems it's a real fun game and if you like games like "Orcs Must Die!" or are looking for a different kind of strategy game, this one might be for you.","October 8, 2014","true","31.7"," 34 of 34 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","34","34","0","0"

Nice musical scoring, sound effects and a decent albeit simplistic storyline makes it more believable and immersive. It's quite addictive once you get into it. It's kinda short but I think has some decent replay value as the game's many traps, weapon types, magical artifacts and terrain based tactics provide for alot of flexibility and different approaches to progressing through the levels. There is also of course a fairly typical multi-branch skill tree that lets you develop your style however you want.\n\nYou basically plan your strategy and setup your traps during the day and then execute it at night, the object being to survive and make it to the next night, which progressively gets more difficult. There are many areas of the map that need defending, so careful planning, timing and execution are essential. And the devs of course left the ending wide open for a sequel which I can say I'm looking forward to. Definitely worth picking up on sale.","January 30, 2014","true","14.7"," 51 of 62 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","51","62","0","2"

It is a Hero defence game.\n\nIt is a strategic action RPG game with linear story line where you play as one of the two playable character to defend the buildings primarily your own home from enemies such as wolves and werewolves. It has a very good tutorial and guide system that slowly implement new stuffs on each day and video guides that shows how the stuffs are used.\n\nGame will get tougher and tougher each day as more and stronger enemies will be introduced each night. More traps and buildings will be introduced as days pass by to help mitigate the stronger enemies. Game can be frustrating to play if you are a perfectionist trying to clear each night with as little points and $ as possible as it is not easy to fight a pack of wolves that swarm over you. Patience and tolerance will be needed as retries and restarts will be needed to re-plan, set more traps and fight again and again.\n\nYou start everyday in a stategic/tactical phase where you can plan and set up traps, buy stuffs and equip the items and upgrade skills.( remember to upgrade income from woodcutting before cutting wood on that day)\n\nAfter planning, setting up and prepared, the action part of the defend will start at night/evening. Attack is pretty simple and standard with only 2 types of weapons available, axes and rifle. Melee attacks are mostly left clicks that auto aim at nearest target and a special 'rage' attack with a right click. Mastering when to attack, rest, dodge is important as each attack, dodge and run require stamina which run dry quickly. Rifle is a shoot and load system like musket which is very easy to use with its aiming system.\n\nThe bad part of this game is most traps needs to be activated by the player and thus good planning is needed to clear the enemies all over the area. The melee attack is not very smooth to me and will take time to master as I keep failing to land blows especially the rage attack. This game lacks multiplayer co-op play which will be more fun to play.\n\nI have cleared half of this game in hard difficulty and it is getting more and more difficult to play. My last game day took me 8 retries. Overall it is a fulfilling game to play after completing each day without trying to spend more.\n\nUpdate: completed hard. Awesome finale. Just realise that this game is just tome 1 and there might be a sequel incoming. Will be interesting if more stuffs and coop play introduced.","October 17, 2015","true","13.4"," 28 of 29 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","28","29","0","0"

I got it in a bundle and while it looked interesting, I put off playing it for several months. In fact the only reason I started playing in June was because of a promotion to earn credit on GMG for getting achievements, but I got drawn into the game and played the campaign to completion. And just about every aspect of it was great.\n\nThe game has a very unique setting, in fact as far as I know it is the only video game ever made that takes place in 1858 French Canada. As someone with an interest in history, this was really cool to me. Considering how many games these days reuse the same tired settings over and over (genric scifi/fantasy, generic urban setting, modern war, WWII, etc.) it’s nice to see more games like this that finally start to tap the vaults of history for unique settings that have never been done before.\n\nSome people might consider the story a bit simplistic, but it’s still really good and somewhat unique. It centers around two lumberjack brothers, and their struggle to defend their sister, their home, and the surrounding area and people from creatures controlled by the Devil and other malicious forces. The story is told through cinematics and in-game cutscenes. The cinematics appear somewhat sparsely throughout the game, but they feature nice high quality artwork. Some may be disappointed that these cinematics are pretty low on actual animation, but considering this is an Indie game I can forgive that, and they still get the job done. The in-game cinematics, which feature the character models from the game, are also decent. I cringed a little bit at the voice acting at first, but as I kept playing I got used to it. It varies between the characters, some aren't that great and some are really quite good and fit the game very well. It's an Indie game so don’t expect AAA voice acting. In terms of dialogue, Jos can be a bit cringe-worthy at times with his simple meat-headed approach to everything, but most of the dialogue isn't bad once you get into the game. Obviously the story is a bit silly with the werewolves and magic and everything, so you have to have the right mindset coming into the game. At the same time, though, I think it is a good story that can be taken seriously with the right approach.\n\nNow, for the gameplay. Basically, at the start of the game, you choose which brother you want to play as. One acts as the “normal difficulty” mode, while the other acts as the “hard mode”. I only played through the campaign once so far, with the “normal” character. Basically, during the day you have a map of the woods around your cabin. Each day (the game takes place over a few weeks in December 1858 and each day is like a level) the map changes a bit, as new paths are revealed and there are new buildings you must defend. Looking at the map, you can see the paths the enemies will take in each wave (augured by the sister with mystical powers), and place a variety of different traps accordingly. Each trap takes a certain number of “action points” (which represent time for the characters) to set, and some also cost money. There are a variety of different cool traps that are unlocked as you progress, like wolf traps, exploding barrels, ballistae, and mortars, and other helpful things like watchtowers and bonfires. There is a lot of strategy involved in where you place your traps, and it’s awesome to see the plan you worked hard on play out perfectly during the night. During the day, you can also visit the nearby village, and later the Amerindian tribe, to stock up on supplies and buy new weapons. The game also features a pretty big skill tree, allowing you to upgrade a lot of different aspects of your character and traps. It’s simple to use and it really adds a lot of depth to the gamplay deciding which skills you want to upgrade and when for best strategy. During the night, the game becomes a third person action game. Many traps require some action on your part to be used, and most of the time you will also have to engage in fights against the enemies that the traps didn’t kill. You have an axe for a melee weapon and a musket or rifle for longer ranged attacks. The combat is a bit a basic, but it does have a really unique feature called “fear factor”. Basically there is a meter showing how frightened your enemies are of you. Over time they muster up for an attack as the meter reaches a certain point, and sometimes they become enraged and are no longer affected by the meter. You can do a number of things to bring the meter down before an enemy becomes enraged, such as shouting or standing near a bonfire. Keeping your enemies afraid of you offers more depth to the combat, and gives you time to reload your musket or regain some stamina. Overall it works well and makes the combat really great. Being surrounded by a pack of hungry wolves, watching as they slowly circle you, waiting for the perfect moment to strike, is a thrilling experience, and I’ve never seen anything quite like it in a video game before.\n\nThe music in the game is fantastic. Every track is great and fits the game well, and I never got tired of hearing it. I should mention that this game can be surprisingly immersive, and the music really helps with that. The game also features interesting descriptions of the items, characters, and their backstories, so there is a lot of lore outside the cutscenes. For example, each axe and musket and some other items have a description detailing things like the year it was made, and what it was used for, etc. History buffs will probably enjoy this. There is also a lot of lore surrounding the enemies which relates to diabolism/demonology and/or pagan mysticism, which will probably be cool if you’re into stuff like that. A lot of it actually turns the traditional Werewolf lore on its head, and it brings in some elements from Amerindian culture for certain other enemies, so there’s definitely a lot of unique and original ideas going on here. With the great music and the attention to detail in the sound, text, and visuals, I found myself getting very immersed in the setting, even while just visiting the different shops and buying supplies.\n\nIn terms of longevity, I got about 16 hours out of my first playthrough of the campaign, and enjoyed just about every minute of it. Of course your mileage may vary, but I’d say that’s pretty damn good for a campaign mode in this day and age. Of course it also has replayability, as you can play through the whole game again as the other brother, and have a slightly different experience.\n\nThe graphics are nothing to write home about. It’s got a nice cartoony style that works well, but it’s nothing particularly impressive. I don’t have any complaints about it, I’m just saying you shouldn’t expect AAA graphics. However, the artwork featured throughout the game is really nice for the most part.\n\nThere isn’t much to complain about. The game does lack a bit of polish in some places. The text is a bit sloppy sometimes, there’s a few noticeable bugs and glitches, and as I stated earlier the voice acting and dialogue isn't perfect. The game also seems to have some framerate issues for me sometimes, though it doesn’t detract from the game too much (I have a very capable desktop though so there’s no reason this game should have issues).\n\nOverall, this game is absolutely fantastic. Sure there are a few small issues, but they barely detract from everything that is great about this game. I highly recommend this game at any price you find it at. I got it in a really cheap bundle, but I almost wish I paid more now. Considering how great this games is, I think the devs deserve some compensation. So don’t delay, if you are even remotely interested in action, strategy, or tower defense, or just want a unique and immersive game, you will probably love this. If you want a number rating I would give it a 9.5/10.","July 8, 2014","true","17.9"," 29 of 32 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","29","32","0","0"

You play the part of one of the legendary O'Carroll brothers, trying to defend yourself and your sister from various evil creatures of the night, like possesed wolves, werewolves and some mythical beings refered to as the Maikans. To help you with this task, you have an axe for close combat and a rifle for ranged. Still, your weapons will not be enough, as your enemies are stronger and greater in numbers. That's where strategy comes into use. During the day, evil sleeps, so it's your chance to place traps in the forest. When night comes, those decisions will either save you or lead you to your doom.\nThe graphics are okay (they look a bit outdated at times though), the sound effects and music are great and the gameplay is very challenging and rewarding; the game's strongest point.

Would rate it at 8 out of 10.\n\nPros:\n- While it does have a linear path, it offers you with a lot of freedom on choosing the way you treat every quest (night), so it offers the possibility to replay it (dunno if really over and over again, but for sure for a few times)\n- Nice story, music and graphics (although cartoonish) that all contribuite to a nice immersion within the game\n- Offers both an easy and hard mode (plus any extra challenges you may set to yourself - like not use all action points or so), as well as optional strategy hints so it can fit a wide range of players (skillwise / smartwise)\n\nCons:\n- Rather limited content - is the kind of game you fall in love, play for a whole night or some solid hours during weekend and finish it; you can try to replay it a few more times, but ultimately is not the kind of game to keep you busy for months.\n\nWhat I see this game great, even after you finished it and got bored of it, is as a distraction for guests (of any age) staying on your place for a few days and wanting to play something fun, but which doesn't requires a commitment / continuation. Could even see it as a group action where everyone colaborates with their thoughts on how to survive the night to come. :)","December 9, 2014","true","24.0"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","17","17","0","0"

It is a masterpiece. I believe its price and constant promos are evidence that you cannot price something so unique.\n\nTower defense. Action. Strategy and RPG. All in 1 game but masterfully intertwined.\n\nYou basicly gota defend your farm against werewolves and other creatures alike.\nYou have a planning phase where you can place a whole array of traps and interesting devices.\nBefore this phase you have an RPG phase where you can buy pots and better weps and armor. Why?\nBecause you have an action phase after the strategy part, where you get to hack n slash and shoot everything that does or doesnt get caught in the traps you've set.\n\nBasicly if you wana go straight to action (action) you can spec and gear (rpg) and ignore the trap setting (strategy) part.\n\nSeriously the gameplay is really fun. The difficulty progression is really well made and the story is quite entertaining aswell.\n\nI just cant wait for a sequel and i definetly recommend this work of art to anyone anyone that enjoys a good game. May it be action or rpg or strategy. this game has it all in a amazingly crafted mechanic and wrapped in a beautiful story and graphics.\n\nPS the music is as unique as the whole concept of the game and fits really well.","January 13, 2015","true","32.6"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","18","19","0","0"

So I decided that instead of going there in-person I'd do the next best thing: play Sang-Froid - Tales of Werewolves.\n\nCanadian technology is way below that of the rest of the world. They still use muskets and Native American blessings. Preachers regularly make deals with Satan there in order to have sex with young women.\n\nChances are you already knew this, but did you know that Canada is terrorized by werewolves?\n\nSang-Froid gives you a third-person view of Canadian life. Basically what you do there is prepare for the werewolf onslaught, and fight them when it's dark out. Shops and housing in Canada lack electricity and are still mostly wood; and each town has a blacksmith. I want to say the Canadians have a simple way of life, but this would be false. When your local preacher makes another faustian deal, and your sister appears posessed, and you have to fight werewolves all night, well, there's nothing simple about it. Canada is a hard life, like Afghanistan or Syria.\n\nOverall this is the best virtual tour of that country, with the depiction from South Park: The Stick of Truth coming in second. It is a good game, but not a great one. Fighting werewolves feels quotidian quickly. And especially for we Americans the Canadian experience might just feel frustrating, given that in our country we can get WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY better guns than that 19th-century stuff. And I know I may sound unfair when I say this, but it's a HUGE disappointment to see that the Canadians are still using the same weapons with which they fought us during The War of 1812. Canada is an ally and if there were ever a major war, and we needed them in the fight, then we'd have to supply them with weapons. In the long run it would cost far less money (and save so many Canadian lives, both from foriegn enemies and werewolves) if they modernized their arms now.\n\n7/10","March 24, 2015","true","3.0"," 24 of 31 people (77%) found this review helpful 35 people found this review funny","77","24","31","35","0"

I usually don't write reviews, and when i do, it means i was extremely satasfied. It has a nice plot, 2 brothers protecting their sister from an army sent by the devil, Fun! The story is really good. The mechanics are good, has its kinks but nothing bad enough to mention. This game proves to be a challange too, Every night you have to defend multible buildings from multible waves of enemies. I can not stress this out enough, YOU WILL NEVER BE OP, 80% of the enemies in this game are much MUCH stronger then you and can kick your ♥♥♥. To stay alive you need to play smart, never just rush into a fight, sure you could swing your axe blindly at the enemy, but it will only be good for about five swings, then you will be lucky to hit anything, and while you are sitting there  trying to get your stamina back the horde of monsters will be beating up on you, unless of coarse your fear factor is high enough, but you will learn about all that in game. I will now put down the pros and cons\n\nPros:\n1. Great story line\n2. Great soundtrack\n3. Beutiful artwork\n4. Forces you to come up with a top notch stradegy for each night\n5. Its a breath of fresh air from the norm of todays stradegy and action games.\n6. Some other stuff, its almost midnight as i type this im tired ;-;\n\nCons:\n1. Heavily influenced by christianity, im a christian and i enjoy this but i understand that there are gonna be some people who dont want to play a game dealing with a religion that they dont follow.\n2. At times a few of the enemies will keep spamming their fastest attack and you will not be able to land a hit on them, but dont let that stop you, you can always shoot them right? :D\n3. Also dealing in religion, if you are christian and you are easily bothered by anything dealing with the devil, you may want to avoid this game because the devil is a character that appears alot throughout the story. Though just keep in mind you are fighting an army of warewolfs and other beasts controlled by him :D\n\n\nHopefully this review is enough to convince some people to buy this game, if you do here is a word of warning, take your time when preparing for the nights because if your stradegy is off by just a tiny bit, everything could possibly go HORRIBLY WRONG, but you will have a chance to fix things while hell is breaking loose :D happy hunting everyone.","November 13, 2014","true","23.0"," 19 of 24 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","19","24","0","0"

If you do a good job before battle, you won't have to rely too much on the combat, which is mostly tedious (although the fear-factor system is genius). There are other issues with the gamee, for example the linear weapon upgrades, which ipso facto limits you to buy a new weapon mid and end-game at the most. Also, the story-telling might disagree with some people, personally I think it went well with the general late 19th century-mystic-goldrush-werewolves-dark woods atmosphere (brilliant!).\n\nI seriously hope the devs have planned another game of the sort, I wouldn't even mind a sequel.

Artifice Studio did a great job of makeing a game that challenges, but never to the point where I wanted to give up. Each defeat filled me with the desire to rush back to the planning mode to ajust my strategy. But I am getting ahead of myself.\n\nThe Game takes place near a small town in the Candian wilderness in The late 1800's, and features an enjoyable Traditional Candian Folk sountrack. This combinded with details like diffrent Alcoholic beverages that each have a blurb describing their historic usage, and provides buffs in battle, the two main charicters being lumberjacks, and the small town that you vist to purchase supplies work in concert to create the feeling that you are playing through a genuine Canadian Folk tale. This is only slightly hamperd by the sub par voice acting, (my biggest gripe with the game) and the somewhat outlandish traps that you gain access to later in the game.\n\nGameplay consistes of two main segments. The first is a planning mode which allows you to spend your money and time units to purchase goods at the afformenioned town, and build traps to help fend off wolves. The second involves fighting the wolves useing the traps you have set up in the first mode along with your musket and axe. The former is where the real meat of the game is, as planning ways to deal with the hoards of wolves with your traps is imperative to surviving the night. It is also where the game really shines, all of the traps and items are useful and fun to use, and the game requires you to be clever with their placement. On top of this the devlopers also did a great job of easing the player into the game by slowly increasing the size of the map, adding aditional objectives to defend, and giveing you access to more traps.\n\nOverall I genuinely enjoyed my expericence with Sang-Froid Tales of Werewolves and recomend it higly if you are a fan of stratagy games.","January 28, 2015","true","8.3"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

Just skip it. Like, wow.\n\nI first saw this game years ago and thought it was focusing its efforts too much on being some try-hard, weird niche game.  I was wrong.\nSang-Froid creates a whole new genre with a sophisticated collaboration of roleplaying, strategy and action.\n\nThe roleplaying allows an insane amount of viability, permitting lumbering melee protagonists or lurking hunters to excel from the well crafted skill tree. Every node you spec into drastically changes the way you can handle situations and the impact of the specs are prominent; unlike most games with skill trees.  Your attack animations change, poisnous bait releases a green gas, and you end up planning your strategies around ever possible advantage you can think of.\n\nThe surprising amount of strategy lets even the simplest of minds feel like a tactile god as they create their own routes, plans and ambushes which will synergize with the player's chosen skills. There's tons of choices to be made and you never feel like you can blame the game for your bad planning, since there’s  an unlimited number of ways to handle scenarios. Do you race the werewolf to the farm and take him one-on-one? Prepare a bonfire there premptivley to create distance between the two of you for the perfect silver bullet head shot. Maybe trap him first to weaken him, or lure him with bait into a hanging net or send him on a 5 minute detour around the map due to fire walls. Your strongest weapon in Sang-Froid is your creativity.\n\nThe most heart racing moments are when your plans are coming together perfectly and you're desperately hiding, covering your scent and watching from the shadows as an Elder Werewolf crosses in front of you. You'll feel an immense feeling of supremacy as he passes you, yet incredible fragility as a single step would reveal yourself to the werewolf and risk the entire fruition of the meticiulous planning. Do you use your scarce silver bullets to take on the werewolf? Do you fight him and try to lure him to the hanging net and release it while he chases you? Do you activate your last bonfire to ward off the monster and aim your last silver bullet as he circles you, waiting for the perfect opprotunity to strike?  Then there is when things don't go according to plan. This is the other exciting part of the Sang-Froid: When you need to improvise, which will happen a lot. Panic and werewolves running rampent and it's up to you to make split second decisions on dozens of variables. Wolves are coming for the hen house, yet this Wendigo needs to be watched for the cannon shot. Perhaps using the wind to carry my scent I can buy the hen house more time, but I have to do it without alerting other werewolves and taking them off their set path.\n\nThere're just too many mechanics in this game, all simple, but work seemlessly with one another, creating one of the most fresh and exciting games I've ever played.\n\nI bought this game on a 90% off steam sale on a whim, but I'd gladly pay the $15 realizing the polish and work of absolute passion put into this game.\n\nAlso, you WILL fall in love with fiddle music after this game.\n\n\n~A sequal with a custom level creator and co-op (with the two brothers) would easily perfect the longevity and creativity of the game.~","June 14, 2014","true","38.3"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","14","19","0","0"

But what I found was a pleasant surprise.\nThis game is charming in an actual way. It appears small but it feels like the people who put this all together made this with a lot of love.\n\nI can see the budget went towards the gameplay sections. This shows when you start to actually play and see what you can do, from the planning of where your traps go, to the AI actually reacting to your pathing, it feels like a giant strategy toybox. This point can be emphasized even after you have placed things like the ziplines, barrels and fire walls as you can zoom in and physically see their placement on the map. This game has so many neat little parts that geuinely add to the overall feel of being this trapper in the northern woods of 19th century Canada.\n\nI really wish the game was a little more polished. The overall performance given to you in the voice over work is basic, which is a double edged sword of quality. Some characters, I felt like they should have had a different tone or lines better delivered. It sort of felt like a lot of stuff got moved at the last minute. It was strange but I can give an example. The young chief of the indians seemed to have an older voice than his wise counselor and it also felt like the voice of the two main characters had been swapped around. I felt like Jos should have had his voice actor reversed for his brother but that is just my opinion.\n\nNever once during combat did I feel the tension ease up and I always had my guard up. When I was playing, I had a moment where I was desperately clicking my right mouse button to load my rifle, so I could just maybe get one more shot off before the werewolves break through my first line of defense. I actually felt a slight bit of stress in that moment, and if you've successfully made me feel stress in a game, you've sold me.\nThe tutorials are nice, fully voice acted and overall the presentation is really good for what it is. I know I haven't sold all the points of the game, but one last thing I feel I should mention is the music.\n\nNow when the music is playing, it feels appropriate. Tense. It sets the mood and even the menu music adds. The menu used as your planning display has this one tune in particular that makes me feel like I was playing Dark Cloud 2 back in the day. It really makes me relax and soak in the atmosphere.\n\nThere is a lot of things I want to say that I can't accurately describe, it's sort of this odd sense of nostalgia that washes over me but it's wholly unique in its own right. The game is well designed, it makes me feel the effort put into it and while despite my Voice Acting complaint, it holds its own as a game. I really recommend it to people, for what it is, I couldn't ask much more of it. Maybe a bit more spit and polish would have served this game, maybe add a compass in the in-field hud and some other small details, but not once so far have I been disappointed. Definitely pick it up while it's cheap.\n\nIf I had to give a rating? Like a 7.5? Low B? It's really good in a wholesome sense. Which is a weird way to describe it.\n","April 16, 2015","true","3.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The story about the sister could of been dropped to 2 brothers simply defending the house, but what I like the most is the Soundtrack, where I've played plenty of big title games with Soundtracks not as good, you'll definitely find yourself tapping your feet. The variety of traps and enemies leaves the player with tonnes of options and obstacles to try and work their way around, and the perfect amount of freedom for those who want to use their brain and let the traps unfold and do the work, or if your in the mood to go toe-to-claw with the beasts. The graphics aren't brilliant and neither is the story, but for the setting, gameplay, artwork and soundtrack, i'd definitely recommend this game, especially for those wanting to get into the strategy games genre. Fingers crossed for a sequel with even more complex levels and possibly multiplayer would be awesome.","February 26, 2014","true","21.2"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

I'm not all up for Indie games, but boy do I recommend this one from the heart. Absolutely, try to give it a chance, Sang-Froid is truely something else and it's massively captivating, thanks to its uncanny music, unique, cartoonish looks (or sometimes even marionette-like characters during the cutscenes), surprisingly well done voice acting and a bit Orcs Must Die!-esque, but still unique on its own way trap/combat mixture of gameplay.\n\nThe puzzles the game offer during its increasingly higher difficulty of levels also surprised me, because with the harder game mode (playing Jack) you really have to rely on strategy (placing traps and making the right decisions) instead of APM-based action hack'n'slash. It was fun figuring out the right way to do the levels, even though one does usually not finish each day (level) with the first try :)\n\nThe only gripe I would have with Sang-Froid is the lack of intice to replay, other than trying out the other character and maybe different ways to finish the individual levels (the game does offer multiple solutions on each level and actual skill-trees, even an economy).\n\nIf you'd like to play something different, please give Sang-Froid a chance because one of a kind, truely innovative games should be celebrated, not to mention that you'll probably going to get lost in awe during the 12 hourish length of the campaign. When I was playing it, it felt like when I'm reading a really captivating novel: the atmosphere just pulls you in and you can't stop reading (or in this case playing) until you reach the final conclusion of the story.\n\nDoes it worth buying on the indie price-range it is offered on? Well if you've read my whole review up to this point, and you can't reach the conclusion, I guess Sang-Froid is not really for you anyway :)\n\nFor the laughable cheap price I picked it up for, it was one of the best buys I've ever done on Steam. Gave my hope back for the Greenlight System for sure! :)\n\nJaSperB out","June 25, 2014","true","18.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

You can't just spam the map with traps, you have to be careful where do you lay what kind of traps. There is a bit too much handholding at the beginning (the first two days are tutorials telling you what icons to click) and there aren't too many levels in the game, but they're just enough for me to have fun and not to feel cheated. Surviving a level with three or four waves can be very satisfying.\n\nThe gameplay and the theme mesh superbly and the story seems to me selfconscious about the subject matter (werewolves). The world of Sang-Froid mixes clichés of Christian and native American folklore as seen in movies and read in books. It's shlock, but luckily it doesn't try to be more than shlock, it's very entertaining.","February 27, 2015","true","18.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

At night... every night they attack a small farm owned by two nasty lumberjacks and their sister. Those filthy lumberjacks put up a huge variety of dirty wolf traps, towers and even shoot at everything that approaches their farm using either ordinary, blessed or silver bullets. Those cowards seek protection near lit fire places and assault all those poor hungry wolves with axes.\nLuckily there are enough different types of wolves and werewolves that vary in strenght, speed and ability to keep the game fair for the wolves. So sometimes the game can be challenging for the lumberjacks, Jos and Jack, too, (I think this is how this food is called) and if they didn't try hard enough a pack wolves can finally feast on their well-deserved succulent midnight snack inside those small cabins. At most times those foolish lumberjacks seem to have huge problems with their conrols, that leave them vulnerable to attacks. Their moves and attacks are quite unreliable, laggy and look unpolished to me. In general I think this game is an average tower defense game, which definitely is more than worth its money (90% steam sale in my case). Aside from suprisingly long loading screens the game is well paced and doesn't get boring too soon. You might end up spending more time planning your stategy for the next night on the overworld map than actually surviving the night. I also think that this game doesn't have a great replay value and I don't really know why (maybe I'm already tired of seeing wolves being murdered).\nIf you are one of those players who insist in pin-point accurate gameplay or blockbuster action, you should stay away from this game! But if you are easily affected by a mysterious and dark atmosphere, neat soundtrack and interesting ideas you should definitely give it a try.","June 9, 2014","true","14.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

The graphics look nice but it seemed as if they couldn't decide whether to make the game look cartoony or realistic. It's hard to explain but it just sometimes seems weird to have a cartoony lumberjack next to such a detailed tree. The monsters look REALLY good though; i was actually getting scared at times when i'd see a werewolf's glowing eyes shining as he lunged towards me.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Somnambuls/recommended/227220/","Somnambuls","D.Cosmos [lv]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Somnambuls/","233 products in account",""Sang-Froid - Tales of Werevolves" is a cute, atmospheric indie tower-defense game set in 19th century Canada, involving a stand against occult forces unleashed upon a family of two brothers and a sister. It has a nice visual style, interesting (yet simple) story and quite the content for the buck. With a solid arsenal of unlockable traps and weapons, as well as skills to build, the game offers a pleasant and intellectually stimulating experience.\n\nWith various possible approaches to the missions (chapters) the game has a bit of something both for players who prefer fighting and those who prefer tactics. Yet, it seems that Sang-Froid is not as rewarding for players who carefully plan out their defenses as it should be, because with careful placement of traps and minimum involvement in combat, I was constantly out of money and struggled to get the best equipment in the first half of the game. Only after few chapters, did I discover that I could just  buy potions and kill enemies, thus saving money for the equipment. And that's a shame, because I would rather be rewarded for playing smart instead of casual. This aspect of the game is also illustrated by the fact that the character gains experience both for succeeding and failing the missions, which allows to unlock new skills either way, thus becoming stronger. It means that you can just grind through stat boosts, save money for better weapons and almost forget about trap placement in the first part of the game.\n\nThere are also some minor faults:\n\n- Combat: the character can only move in four directions – no diagonal moves and change of a direction is not seamless; the camera movement during the fights is also a problem.\n- Navigation: that mini map sure makes your head spin and you can easily go the wrong way, which could be a crucial mistake when the time is running out\n- Trap placement: there is a hidden grid, but there are areas where it is not always possible to place fire wall tiles in straight lines. The game likes to add an extra tile to your desired construction sometimes, thus wasting your limited action points. It sure would have been more convenient, if it was possible to add a tile by tile and remove them tile by tile instead of all the firewall.\n- Economy: the action point cost and prices for some traps doesn't seem balanced for me against their potential usefullness. For example, I never used an explosive barrel during the game, because it is an expensive trap with limited usefullness and there is a high risk of failure.\n\nBut despite its flaws "Sang-Froid" is a very good game and I recommend it to all tower-defence fans or someone who just wants to take a break from shooters like I did.\n\nMy overall rating: 8/10.","February 27","true","23.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's amazing how such a small team can create such a fun tower defense title. And with that much polish.\n\nThe game can be compared to Orcs Must Die in that you'll be running around killing enemies as well, in addition to your traps. Now, the traps must be placed prior to starting the game so there's no adding traps once the game has begun. Thankfully the map shows you which enemies will spawn where, what traps are most effective, and where they're headed. A level can have up to 6 waves so it's important that you try to remember the roads your enemies will be taking in order to get to your bases in time. Killing enemies will earn you money which can be used to buy new weapons, gear, potions and ammo. Completing waves will also earn you experience so you'll be able to upgrade your character with more health, or make your traps more effective.\n\nFor a tower defense game the story is actually pretty good. They put a lot of effort in it and the cutscenes are well done. The voice acting, however, is mediocre at best, which is a real shame. It's just so wooden and brought with no emotion at all. The music, on the other hand, is solid and the voices of your enemies are well done, too.\n\nThe graphics are cool, and the characters use a certain style, which I liked. The game doesn't support 2560x1440, which was a little bit frustrating for me personally as it made the game look blurry. But since the rest of the game is so well done I'll just ignore it.\n\nThe game can be completed in about 11 hours, by the way, so it's also pretty lengthy.\n\n[Rating: 75/100]","April 11, 2013","true","15.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

From the theoretical point of view, the game follows a simple tower/hero-defense pattern : During the daylight, get prepared for the nocturnal attack of the Werewolves; buy weapons; set traps; use the gathered skill points to equip your character with perks and yet you're ready to start a nightmarish night! But in fact, practically, it's not that simple at all cause there are really plenty lot of important things to take care of before embarking on the Werewolves killing adventure. Ladies and Gentlemen, please be assured that "every" game design element will effect your performance during the night! You're not about to face a game, as said, "with minor RPG elements" as the game provides a magnificent hierarchy of character power-ups that reminds you of classic old school RPGs while at the same time regards the fact that the game is being represented to post-modern gamers. And that means the hierarchy system avoids any sort of sophisticated rules of choosing this ability instead of that. The player's first,second even third mistake is not their last mistake as the game gives you the opportunity to think over your strategy once again.\n\n...\n\nIn addition to the strategy planning, "Sang-Froid" is also a 3rd-person tactical p.o.v. which make you confront with the enemy with melee or ranged weapons. During the 3rd-person experience you'll have to protect the playable character while defending specified buildings or areas and that's when two style of game-play, tower and hero defense, are mixed up with each other in order to give birth to a brand new mechanism style of survival-horror.\n\n...\n\nBy the first glance, the story may seem like a simple "Tale of Werewolves" but as the narration progresses, other twist will save the story from being a linear tale to multiple story lines told in parallel channels in order to add a deep sense of suspense and excitement to the core tale. The story is often narrated by cut-scene in the form of two/three-personage dialogs and sometimes by illustrated cut scenes all of which are empowered with charming voice acting.\n\nThe music is perhaps a part of game-play as it won't let you down during the night battles. It's so motivating to hear a well-chosen merry  Celtic/Francophone-Canadian Folk* songs during a face-to-face battle with a Grand Werewolf as it brings hope into your heart letting you chop the Wolf fella in two. That's not the only thing one can mention about the voices in the game. Perhaps you'll admit this after you've hear the warming voice of the tutorials narrator. The sound effects design of the game will make you feel yourself in a real forest of frozen maple trees, near a hut with a smoking chimney, under the pale light of the full moon playing hide-and-seek as the dark clouds pass by and eventually a cry of a wolf in a distance...\n\n...\n\nTo conclude, I'd like to state that fortunately "Sang-Froid : A Tales of Werewolves" is based on a great story-line which is followed by appealing presentation, making the excellent game-play a much better experience.\n\nVandad\n\n*Please Note: I'd be more than grateful if any of the respectable readers let me know what the exact academic name for these category/genre of songs is.","November 26, 2013","true","5.2"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

If you enjoyed any of these games you'll probably love Sang-Froid.\n\nEvery night your house is attacked by waves of wolves and werewolves and you must set traps during the day to protect yourself when the night falls.\nThe first few levels are meh, but as the game progress you'll be dying quite a lot of times each night until you can find the appropriate strategy for each level (especially if you're autistic like me and started the game on hard mode).\n\nThe gameplay is divided in two parts, the planning mode during the day where you can buy stuff at stores, equip and level your character and spend money/time setting up traps on a overview map of the forest near your house, and the action part during the night, when you actually control your character around so you can ambush wolves with your axe and traps.\n\nAlthough the graphics are "dated" the game still looks fine. Simplistic, but better than most indie games out there.\nThe OST is great, I mean, listen to the first video on the Steam store page. The background music always sets the perfect mood for whatever is happening. It's one of the strong points of the game.\n\nTo sum it up, it's an amazing tower defense and action game, challenging as hell if you play on hard mode, great atmosphere and excellent game mechanics.

That is to say, it has so many interesting mechanics and ideas at work, you'd swear they were introduced over several games. But no -- somehow, Artifice has managed to come up with a half dozen new ideas all at once, and each builds on the last wonderfully.\n\nBy far the most important is the "fear factor" -- this system really makes it feel like you're fighting a pack of wolves, unlike every other game where enemies just run up to you without thought. I never knew I wanted a "realistic" wolf fighting game before, but there you are.\n\nAside from the gameplay, the music is impressive and catchy, but most other aspects do fall a little short. The graphics are dated and the voice actors aren't remotely up to the job. But the game itself is so different and fun that I can easily look past those flaws.\n\nMy only other complaint is that with every stage introducting new things, there isn't much time to play around with each individual feature. It sounds odd to basically want filler, but having a second stage between each change would make it feel less rushed. On the other hand, it does contribute to an on-edge atmosphere, since you have to deal with the unknown every single level.","December 28, 2013","true","15.2"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

Gameplay is, at best, banal and repetitive.  Despite the appearance of strategy elements, the actual gameplay is primarily action-oriented -- that is once you can get past the tedious hand-holding tutorials.  What really drives it into the trash heap is the writing, cutscenes and VA.\n\nCombat is primarily action-based, with a thin veneer of tactics on the surface.  Once you actually have some contol of the tactical aspect, you quickly realize how effectively limited your options are.  Most traps are ineffective and you end up using the same basic traps ad nauseam, in typically the same places every day.  The buildings that you are required to defend are apparently made out of rice paper, because a single wolf can destroy any structure located on the opposite side of the map in a matter of seconds, causing you to fail the night.\n\nI understand the gun mechanic is intended to supplement combat, but it's not enough to save you from the tedium of constantly running around and wildly swinning an axe.  The timing of events in combat is imprecise and slightly unresponsive.  The game is touted as being a variation on Tower Defense, but let's be clear:  Get used to swinging an axe, it's 80% of what you do.\n\nThe writing is unbelievably bad.  It seems to be composed of lifeless tropes, clichés and hamfisted exposition.  The idioms are inappropriate and inconsistent with the setting, the characters are dimensionless, idiotic puppets playing out a callow farce.  Even the poor spelling, punctuation and  grammar exposes the lack of education and sloppy QC of the people involved.\n\nYou're expected(?) to endure panel cutscenes at the beginning of each 'day' that foreshadow the subsequent combat scenario.  I cannot adequately describe how crass and farcical these scenes actually are, but subjectively speaking, they're awful.  Beyond the terrible writing, you have to listen to even-more-terrible voice acting.  The 'actors' mispronounce words everywhere (to almost comic effect), even inconsistently mispronouncing each other's names.  The characters are native to the story's setting, which is in northern [read: French] Canada, yet they manage still to mispronounce the names of Canadian cities.\n\nAgain, the 'actors' cannot even remotely keep their accents and idioms on target -- instead they meander all over the place, ranging from faux-British, to faux-Canadian, to Texan, to Mexican.  The female character central to the story is French-Canadian, pale skin, long red hair and -- get this -- voiced by a borderline-illiterate Hispanic woman.  The two protagonist brothers aren't voiced much better, either.  It's painful to listen to.\n\nPros:\n- Looks like a strategy RPG.\n- 3/10 gameplay. Not the worst game on steam, sadly.\n\nCons:\n- Not a really strategy RPG.\n- About as tactical as Gauntlet Legends.\n- Traps are only a minor gimmic.\n- Shallow, repetitive Hack-and-Slash gameplay.\n- Controls are loose/laggy.\n- Poor QC/QA.\n- Awful writing/storyline.\n- Terrible voice acting.\n- Mostly comparable to a sloppy PS1-era fantasy action game.\n- Almost shovelware.\n\n2/10:  Would not buy again.","February 15, 2014","false","1.0"," 22 of 42 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","22","42","0","2"

It was worth every moment of my time. Before anything else, you should know that this hasn't got all that much hack 'n slash in it. The combat is more of a fallback or a way to finish opponents wounded by traps. The real meat of the game is in the planning phase, everything else is merely execution. That doesn't mean it's not fun though. The moments before you spring a deadly trap are as tense as the combat that comes after the trap thins the pack (or fumbles miserably). Speaking of traps, there's a pretty good variety of them as well as a fair variety of enemies that are quite distinct from one another. The game has a number of interesting mechanics that set it apart, such as the fear factor and the ability to manipulate your foes via noise and scent. Unfortunately the voice acting and cutscene animations are kind of terrible. The story isn't that great (let's hope it's a set up for a better one in the sequel).

The 'amateurish' character models in the cutscenes deliver the story well the story is enough to pull you along making you wonder why the thing are happening. Story is good enough to make you want to keep playing.\n\nThe core of the game as described above is towerdefense meets action rpg.

What makes this hard is that the money you gain from winning a map has to be used to upgrade your character and to buy equipment.

Your axe is your primary method of taking out the beasts.  You do get a musket to use and can load it with blessed (costs extra) slugs, but with the slowness of loading and getting the gun ready, it is by no means a "Primary Weapn".  The gun is there to be used as a mobile trap and only while the mobs are still afraid of you.\n\nThis game is not "Action Packed", there are a ton of speed bumps here.  While the cut scenes provide a dialog and story that isn't found in other TD games and I apprecaite that, it does feel "slowing" to me.  Much of the game is spent going to town to spend your pennies (wisely), setting up your traps, working out a strat or wrapped up in dialog.  The battle-time where you're running around swinging your axe winds up being cut down to maybe 10% of the overall game time.\n(Note: I didn't time it out to verifiy "10%" but it feels like very little time, goes by quickly.)\n\nIf you try to go back and replay a map, you lose all of your progress.   So you can't replay "Day 3" with "Day 7" gear.  Again, this is "Forced Story-Line" gameplay.  You can't muck that up with better weapons/traps.  It would be nice to be able to do that though, since you could gain XP and Cash to make moving forward easier.\n\nThis is a good Stategic Thinking trainer though.  You really do have to plan out your night, where you're going to run and when.   You have unlimited time to sit there planning out your trap placement and sequence of movements.   (Stay at farm for wave 1, move to the chicken coop for wave 2... etc.)  The Zip Line is an excellent addition for movement though, you will greatly appreciate that tower!  Walking is slow and running burns your stamina too quickly.\n\nOverall, I give it a Thumbs Up, but for the reasons listed above I'm going to say "buyer be aware".\n","July 12, 2014","true","3.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Every level requires a careful plan, without a detail of the enemy's plan overlooked. The tension is palpable, as timing is everything: will the wolves finish the bait and move on your house before you've finished killing a werewolf clear on the other side of the map? How long do you have before the bonfire goes out and the pack closes in?\nSet in pre-Confederation Canada, the setting feels real and is well-maintained: every weapon, potion, trap and setpiece fits in the world. Even the prices are accurate to the time (eg. A bullet only costs a penny, and to bless them costs ten cents). Budgeting your money becomes another challenge; saving up for a better gun becomes difficult when you still have to worry about affording your silver bullets and spike traps to survive the next night.\nAs a game, it is quite fun and exciting, but there are some issues with the presentation. The graphics are nothing pretty, but adequate. The music might wear on your nerves, depending on your taste, but like almost everything else, it is accurate to the time. There is one problem that stuck out, and that is the voice acting, which is bad enough that it falls noticably below the standards that every other aspect of the game meets. Despite the obvious setting, the characters do not speak with the proper accent, nor do they acknowledge the severity of the situation in their flat line-reading. My reccomendation would be to turn off the voices, and I'm thankful that the option is provided.\nOnce the voices had been muted, I had a wonderful time with this game.","January 27, 2014","true","3.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The opening music alone is worth the current sale price ($1.49-almost as much as a song on iTunes), although I'd recommend this game even without a discount. 1850s Canada is quite the refreshing setting, an unfamiliar time and place that only adds to the unfolding mystery.\n\nSang-Froid definitely has an indie feel to it-especially with the cutscenes-but the gameplay mechanics are intuitive and solid. I love the different stages in each level, from placing traps and planning a defense during the day to executing your plan come nightfall, for better or for worse. There's this sense of escalating urgency to the whole thing, as if there's just not enough time or resources to make it through to the next day.\n\nIn one instance I stood upwind from a pack and heard their howls as they caught and followed my scent. I snared an oncoming werewolf in a bear trap and crushed it to death with a quick shot to the overhanging rock pile I'd placed, then I frantically ran from its companions back to a bonfire by the cabin, rolling this way and that out of their clawing reach, barely able to light the fire before running out of stamina, and just able to frighten the beasts to catch a quick breather before axing them all to death in a ferocious back-and-forth dance around the fire-only to have to sprint right over to the next building in a panic to catch more of the werewolves before they could finish tearing everything to rubble.

Recommend you do not skip these, as they are very helpful. The learning curve is not too bad, however, preplanning and strategy is critical to this game, and the game has a nice feature where you can restart at dawn or dusk (allowing you to restart with or without all your traps still on the field).\n\nThe story is pretty decent, however, I must admit that the theme does not appeal to me very much (devil + his minions) - I've started skipping the cutscenes.\n\nEach "night" or level adds a layer of complexity, adding new traps, enemies, and areas of the map (the logging company will clear new areas every few levels).\n\nThe upgrading tree offers a lot of different areas to select from to best match your preferred play style, and there are 2 characters to select from (one specializing in combat and the other in trap-laying and strategy).\n\nYou can go to town to buy new weapons, bless your weapons/buy blessed bullets (to do extra damage to "evil" enemies), and later you have the option of buying silver weapons (to use against the Maikans {wolf humanoids; distinct from werewolves}).\n\nIn the preplanning screen, you can select traps to use. These all cost action points, however, the ones that also cost money are permanent and will persist through the nights so long as they are not used. You can also click on the wave tabs to see which enemies you will be encountering. A very useful feature is your sister's precognition, which will show you where your enemies will travel if you click their tab - this is essential for planning where to place your traps. As you progress, you will unlock more buildings that provide more AP to your pool, however, they also provide more targets for your enemies. You lose if any building is destroyed.\n\nThere are many cool mechanics during gameplay, one being wind and shouting. Wind affects where your scent can be detected, and shouting also pulls all enemies from a large radius. You unlock a talisman later in the game that allows you to manipulate where the wind is blowing - very useful for pulling enemies from an even larger radius than shout. A red icon shows where enemies will look for you, and you can use this to lure them to your traps (like spike traps or hanging nets {with rocks}).\n\nFear factor is a very interesting concept, and enemies will attack you when their fear factor matches yours. This allows you to control the flow of combat - so long as your fear factor is higher (like when you are near a fire) than your enemy's, they will be less likely to attack you right away. Werewolves have a bloodlust ability that gives them infinite fear factor (aka aggro). Attacking and defeating enemies will lower their fear factor, and there are items that further increase your own (like necklaces and potions/drinks).\n\nThe game runs incredibly well, and it is extremely fun to plan out how to best deal with your enemies - especially in the later nights when different groups and waves will target different buildings. Investing in zip line towers is critical to increasing your mobility. There are also fire walls, and these are integral to survival because they will force enemies to reroute (to potentially longer routes), buying you more time to deal with your priorities. Blocking enemies off completely will cause them to take the shortest route (and the damage).\n\nAny leftover AP you have can be used to cut wood, providing you much needed money. Maximizing your trap efficiency and wood cutting will ensure that you have a of money to spend on weapon upgrades and other equipment.\n\nIf you are interested at all or enjoy TD-games, you have to give this a try. It is one of the best TD-games I have come across.\n\nStrongly recommend!","July 14, 2014","true","6.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The opening music alone is worth the current sale price ($1.49-almost as much as a song on iTunes), although I'd recommend this game even without a discount. 1850s Canada is quite the refreshing setting, an unfamiliar time and place that only adds to the unfolding mystery.\n\nSang-Froid definitely has an indie feel to it-especially with the cutscenes-but the gameplay mechanics are intuitive and solid. I love the different stages in each level, from placing traps and planning a defense during the day to executing your plan come nightfall, for better or for worse. There's this sense of escalating urgency to the whole thing, as if there's just not enough time or resources to make it through to the next day.\n\nIn one instance I stood upwind from a pack and heard their howls as they caught and followed my scent. I snared an oncoming werewolf in a bear trap and crushed it to death with a quick shot to the overhanging rock pile I'd placed, then I frantically ran from its companions back to a bonfire by the cabin, rolling this way and that out of their clawing reach, barely able to light the fire before running out of stamina, and just able to frighten the beasts to catch a quick breather before axing them all to death in a ferocious back-and-forth dance around the fire-only to have to sprint right over to the next building in a panic to catch more of the werewolves before they could finish tearing everything to rubble.

You cannot repeat previous levels in the campaign without consequences. If you want to go back to a certain day, you lose all the progress made after that point.\n\nIn addition to fixing that flaw, this game severely needs an "Endurance Mode" and another mode that features randomization of the enemy's attack patterns.\n\nMy issues with the game still shouldn't dissuade you from purchasing Sang-Froid -- even at full\nprice -- because it is more than worth it.","June 2, 2014","true","43.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

(Spoiler-Maybe?)\n\nFirstly I like the story/topic. Two brothers trying to survive and protect their ill sister as werewolve's and other creatures  descend upon them. The topic "werewolve's" it's an easy place to make a rich story and as you get farther in the game it becomes so.\n\nThis game does and does not hold your hand, You are explained everything in great detail and taught how to play the game but it is wholey up to you to excecute what you have been taught and at certain times flawlessly. it really leads you calmly into the woods then leaves you to the wolves.\n\nThe gameplay is exillerating! you plan out everything all of your traps, what weapon's you will use, where the enemy is coming from, what type of enemy and how many there will be before nightfall. You plan and learn as you play the game and you are forced to do so. Then when night comes you see if your tactic and preperation payed off, Did you miss something? or forget something? Did your traps work like you imagined they would? did you bring enough silver or blessed bullets? you find out quickly if what you had done the day before was enough to help you through the grizzly night.\n\nYou purchase items from the town and other places to help you against the varied and versatile creatures. You start with a ♥♥♥♥ poor woodsman's axe and an old musket, They get the job done for a while but not for too long at least not in the state they're in. So you look to upgrade walking into the blacksmith's shop you spot a nice looking lumberjacks axe that put's your  current affair to shame' however... It cost's 5 dollars! tripple your current allowance for shiny axes. feeling crummy and that the world is against you you walk into a chapel to angrilly pray at god! But as you enter a nun approaches and seeing your axe she offers to bless it with holy power effectivly doubling it's current strength she'll bless you'r normal style bullet's too. Suddenly that crap axe is looking pretty swell and your musket doesn't make you want to use it to shoot yourself in the head.\n\nThis game does a really good job at pulling you in at least it did for me. At first I didn't know what to think playing the first few chapters I was let's say unimmpressed.  but as I progressed I was compelled to continue and the more I played the more I felt that way, That drive didn't wear off for me and it still hasn't.\n\nWhat I don't like about it.\nBug's they are in every game and I hate them! (Unless they're funny)\nI can say that I like just about everything in this game I have no bad to say about it but that's just me.\n\n\nAnyone reading this is their own critic as it should be, You're just looking for some insight on a game. But I know and you know that it doesn't really matter what I or anyone else sais, What matter's is how you feel when you play the game.\n\nThank's for reading.\n\nP.S. this game has a demo! simply search "Sang Froid" on steam and give it a go!","February 6, 2015","true","11.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The gameplay is divided into strategic planning (i.e. setting traps, managing money and action points) and fighting wolves with an axe and a front-loader rifle, ideally making strategic use of the traps you set in the previous phase. If strategy appeals to you, do not be afraid to play as Jack.\n\nThe game owes some of its mechanics to tower defense with a hero, but it transcends those in ways that give it much more flexibility and promise to make it much more interesting. That is mostly because the enemy waves have objectives and no fixed paths, and the player can influence them in various ways.\n\nThe game is fairly simple toget the hang of if you know to WASD your way around at night. I don't expect Sang-Froid to have the depth of a "serious" strategy game because this game seems aimed at the discerning casual gamer, but I'm confident that however "casual" the experience might turn out to be, it's going to be enjoyable.

This is by far the weakest part of the game.\n\nThe game itself is well designed otherwise.\n\nThe traps, the defenses you plan during the day, are simple to understand and use. The combat, while it may take a few levels to master, is effective. Lastly, the achievement system is simple yet effective.\n\nThe game is also the first of at least two planned games. Personally, I'm looking forward towards the next game in the series.\n\n\nReview based on roughly 25 hours played, two playthroughs, with both brothers, and 100% achievements completed.","February 2, 2014","true","24.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Well, this game is really worthwhile! Strategic and roleplay features make incredible atmosphere of a folk horror tale, which is supported with a fantastic soundtrack. Highly recomended!\n\nAdvatages:\n1) Comfortable system of strategic planning and fiendly interface.\n2) Wonderful roleplay system: without an odd complexity, but with a good variety.\n3) Enchanting soundtrack!\n4) Very realistic gameplay: we get money from selling wolves' fur and lumbering (gold doesn't run out from killed enemies instead of blood)\n5) All the cinematics could be skipped.\n\nDisadvantages:\n1) I agree that the style of graphics makes the spirit of the game, but some models could be much smoothy.\n\n\nПотенциал этой игры я понял, когда голосовал за неё в GreenLight. Но, как это у меня заведено, ждал скидок 50+ %. Игра оправдала ожидания. Стратегические и ролевые моменты на высоте, адреналина в драках тоже хватает.\n\nПлюсы:\n1) Хорошая система планирования ловушек и удобный интерфейс.\n2) Отличная ролевая система. Не замороченная, как это любят в современных играх, но достаточно разнообразная, чтобы выбрать свой стиль игры.\n3) Очень приятный саундтрек.\n4) Продуманные детали сюжета и геймплея. Например, деньги мы получаем от продажи шкур и от работы на вырубке (а не собираем брызнувшее из чудовищ, как  сок из ягод, золото)\n5) Почти все ролики и заставки можно пропустить.\n\nМинусы:\n1) Графика, конечно, могла бы быть и получше.

Some games do it wrong and plaster your face with 3rd party launchers past Steam and a ton of logos.\nWhen I started Sang-Froid, I was instantly welcomed with a plain loading screen accompanied by the single best intro theme I've heard in months, if not years. Not kidding, I was actually disappointed when the game finished loading and the song got cut off, so much I actually went and found myself the full into song online.\n\nHowever, after the intro song + narration I was sure I had a neat game at my hands and I wasn't disappointed: Whilst the graphic and animations certainly aren't worthy of an AAA title (and there are a couple animation errors all across the game), they provide exactly the charme the intro already emitted. Overall, a really nice part of the game is it's atmosphere: You indeed feel like playing in the later colonial era, a time filled with issues of belief, mystic and tales. Except for the horrible facial models, everything the game shows and tells you feels really authentic.\n\nOf course we are here to play a game though, not check on a visua novel, so how's the gameplay?\nIntriguing, to say the least. The early days start out really simple. Go there, shoot that wolf, axe those other wolves some questions. Quickly you learn that any enemy group with more then two enemies means certain death if you don't fight with a brain (and an eye on your stamina gauge).\nBut as the day progresses, so does your equipment, your character and, of course, the enemies, both in quality and number.\nOn daytime, you get the next bit of the story and place traps and other devices. As soon as the sun falls, you run around, trigger the traps and defend up to 5 locations at once. Impossible you say? A nice challenge, I say, given the game has a really fair difficulty curve (and an additional 'difficulty setting' in form of two character, with one being clearly weaker then the other and advertised as 'hard mode').\n\nOverall, Sang-Froid is exactly the kind of great game I would wish every indie title would be.\nThough, there IS a little catch: The game has no replayability value. At best, you will go and play it twice, assuming you started with the easier character (I didn't, and are welcoming the difficulty. Albeit this cuts my potential playtime in half.) I'm currently 2/3rds through the game in mere 4 hours.\nThis feels a tad short, especially if you got to consider the base 15€ price.

The video makes it seem crazy hard but the game itself eases you into it plenty well. If I had any complaint it was that the game just isn't long enough.\n\nActually because it is a short game I can not recommend it at full price. I beat the game in about 7 hours. So even playing both brothers the game is still worth more than $1 per expected hour of game play. It was a good enough game I'll play it again but not any time soon.\n\nVerdict - Get it for sale under $5 and you'll love it (It has gone under $5 at least twice to my knowledge so it does happen)","November 4, 2014","true","21.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Too bad it refuses to run in full screen, no matter how much I play with the graphical settings of both the game and my computer. The icons render too itty bitty to read, and the game is essentially unplayable.\n\nThis is a apparently a problem with my monitor, in the sense that my monitor uses tech that is more advanced than what the game supports. But even when I scale my monitor's resolution down to 1024x768 and adjust the game's settings to match it, the game window just gets smaller and smaller. I get the best results keeping the monitor at 3200x1800 and running the game at 1900x1080, but even then it still takes up just a third of the screen. Probably a problem unique to my particular monitor, but unfortunate that I don't get to enjoy the game as intended, and I just wanted to put that out there as a potential warning, even if it is an unlikely one.

Anyone would be excused for thinking of isometric Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) games like LOL or DOTA, or Orcs Must Die where the combat is hectic, constant, fast paced and deals with hundreds of mindless mobs marching towards your side, but Sang-Froid is not. Instead the action is tense, tactical, clever and far more personal.\n\nEvery game, you start off with a top down perspective of a pine forest through which snowy trails wind towards your cabin. They're paths taken by an onslaught of wolves out to tear it down. This is the planning phase. At first, you just need to defend the cabin where your sick sister lies, but soon the barn, mill, church and more buildings get added to the community under your care. Your sister is a special kind of sick however. She can see from where the wolves are coming to attack those buildings and what routes they'll take, through visions.\n\nThis is where the first difference between the game and others like it become apparant: It's personal. When you choose to leave the planning stage and enter the world, the third person hack&slash ensures that your character is the most versatile weapon you have and there really aren't that many wolves, especially in the beginning. Its just that the wolves are capable of coming in from anywhere and your character is just one man with a tiny bar of stamina that can't possibly cover the large stretches of space between buildings AND safely fight more than a few wolves at the same time. And when you do choose to engage, the wolves aren't fodder either. They really are characters in their own right.\n\nPersonal combat is involving. Should they have all pounced at once, they would have torn you apart, but a complex system of fear and intimidation, using roars, fires and actions, will see them circling while you deal with those few who manage the courage to take swipes at you. You are are armed with axe and rifle, but the axe will quickly sap your stamina and your rifle is an antique that requires 10 seconds of loading. Tougher foes arrive by themselves or in pairs, but these are often so durable that they take just as much time as any one of those packs.\nCombat is a long process against worthy foes then, but time isn't something you have as more packs all over the map close in on your buildings.\n\nThis is where the traps come in, and a good deal of patience and savvy from you. Using the planning phase ahead of the third person action phase, allows you to not only prepare your own community through the purchase of gear, but to prepare a strategy for dealing with all of these packs at the same time. And instead of just placing down towers that splash the occasional damage, these traps are of the visceral, personal kind, suited to dealing with a foe that would have given you so much trouble in melee.\n\nBearclaws will instantly kill the four legged wolves. Bait attracts and slows them down, giving you precious extra time. Placing nets with an avalanche of rocks in them high among the treetops, will bury werewolves when timed right. Place kindle in certain passages and set it alight to redirect packs.\nSome of these traps work automatic. Others are far more involving. The net trap for example, needs to be triggered by a shot from your rifle, preferably after luring the werewolf underneath through the use of deception: Bait or a shout to lure it there.\n\nIf there's one thing the game does exceedingly well, it is to establish the relationship between hunter and hunted, or making you feel like a rugged outdoors man triumphing over nature through wit. You are keenly aware of just how frightful and tough a werewolf can be in combat, so seeing it carried off through the air on the sharp tip of a ballista bolt after you've personally set it off and tricked the wolf in the right position is a gleeful moment. The transfer between planning phase where you control the map, and action phase where your control is limited to the range of your gun is a disempowering one. The map is tidy, but on foot, the mill is a world away. All you could do is set some spike traps around it, only to realize you couldn't do the same for the werewolf you are about to face for lack of cash. There's only a bonfire for him, to keep him back. "Will it work?" You will wonder.\n\nIn such a moment, a sudden swish-click-yelp sound in the far distance of the frozen wintersky, will make you smile as you keep warm around the lit bonfire.\n\n\nOther than this, the game itself has charm too. Its not a looker, with somewhat decent animation and bearable graphics. Sometimes, the voice acting is cringe-worthy too, with a cast of would-be native Americans barely able to manage the accent. But a cast there is however, with cutscenes and a story too that - although not particular exciting - perfectly enforces the atmosphere of being a Canadian lumberjack on the frontier of a dangerous wildernesses. The mythology of werewolves and Canadian folklore is handled with careful respect and soon you'll be facing creatures from both British Canadian Christian fables and Native American Folklore. Even items are carefully described for their history in logging and Canadian history. I don't even mind the completely outdated method of clicking on individual buildings when going to town to buy gear. It adds to charm. The sound and music make up for a lot and once you manage to see past the outdated looks, you'll appreciate the cartoony feeling and the perfect v-shaped broom closet that is your main character.\n","January 1, 2014","true","30.2"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Pour ce faire, ils devront utiliser l'environnement qui les entoure à leur avantage et préparer de savants pièges et outils qui leur permettront de tenir une nuit de plus. Passons au travers des quelques éléments qui constituent ce magnifique jeu;\n\n\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK0yF8EDGlA&hd=1\n\n\n\nLes deux frères / niveaux de difficulté\n\nSangFroid_Feuille-PersonnageEn commençant votre partie, vous aurez le choix de jouer l'un des deux frères (Jacques "Ti-Jack" et Joseph "Ti-Jos" O'Carroll). Les deux frères représentant les deux niveaux de difficulté du jeu; Facile/Difficile. En jouant avec Jacques O'Carroll (le mode difficile), vous serez un chasseur agile et rusé. Vous devrez faire preuve d'ingéniosité à l'aide de vos trappes et de votre fusil de chasse, étant plus faible physiquement que votre autre frère, la ruse sera votre meilleure arme! En jouant avec Joseph O'Carroll (le mode facile), vous serez un fier bûcheron fort et robuste. Vos coups de hache seront forts et puissants, il est également important de remarquer vous aurez beaucoup plus de facilité à résister aux attaques de vos ennemis. Les deux personnages auront accès aux mêmes actions, objets et arbres de compétences. Cependant, les différences se joueront au niveau de la résistance physique, de la force de frappe avec la hache, de la précision aux armes à feu ainsi que l'agilité de chaque personnage. Tandis que l'un sera beaucoup plus résistant, l'autre devra garder ses distances. Et alors que l'un possède une meilleure maîtrise de l'arme à feu, l'autre devra se préférer l'utilisation de sa fidèle hache.\n\n\n\nLa phase de préparations (le jour)\n\nSangFroid_Jour-MonstresLe jour, c'est votre période de préparation. Vous aurez accès à une carte détaillée de l'environnement dans lequel vous allez combattre. Sur ladite carte régionale, vous aurez la possibilité de voir des cartes de monstre vous permettant de planifier vos défenses grâce aux prédictions de votre petite sœur, Joséphine. Ces cartes vous permettront de connaître chaque type de monstre, l'endroit d'où ceux-ci débuteront leur attaque, leur trajectoire ainsi que leur but final. Une mission se déroule généralement sur deux tours (ou plus), les prévisions de Joséphine vous permettront également de connaître d'avance l'ordre d’apparition des monstres pour chaque tour.\n\nSangFroid_Jour-Trappes\n\nPour vous défendre contre les monstres, vous aurez la possibilité de placer des pièges de toutes sortes pour vous aider dans votre tâche; appâts pour ralentir certaines créatures, feux-de-joie pour effrayer certaines créatures, murs de feu pour changer la trajectoire de vos ennemis, trappes-à-ours, et plus encore! Chaque monstre possède ses faiblesses, et ce sera votre travail de savoir quels pièges sont les plus appropriés aux situations dans lesquelles vous vous retrouverez. Pour installer un piège ou une installation, vous devriez utiliser vos sous ainsi que vos points d'action. Après un certain point dans le jeu, vous serez dans la mesure d'échanger vos points d'action contre des sous supplémentaires en coupant du bois.\n\nSangFroid_Magasin-GeneralPendant la préparation de vos défenses pour la nuit, vous aurez également la chance de visiter le village de Val-aux-loups afin de faire quelques emplettes aux différents magasins du village. Vous pourrez y acheter armes, balles pour vos armes à feu, objets de guérison, etc. Afin de pouvoir faire vos achats, vous devrez utiliser les sous que vous aurez amassé au courant de vos dernières aventures. (Vous aurez des sous pour chaque monstre que vous aurez tué, pour chaque mission complétée, ou bien en vendant du bois.)\n\nUne fois que vous êtes préparés, il ne vous reste plus qu'à attendre que la nuit se lève.\n\n\n\nLa phase de combat (la nuit)\n\nSangFroid_NuitEt la nuit, c'est là que l'action commence! Vous aurez un petit laps de temps pour déplacer votre personnage là où vous le souhaitez avant que la première vague d'attaque ne commence. Par la suite, vous devrez vous assurer que chaque créature a bien été tuée pour sauter à l'étape suivante. Pour ce faire, vous pourrez activer certaines trappes manuellement (pièges de roches suspendues, feux-de-joie, etc.) ou bien attaquer les créatures directement à l'aide de votre hache et de votre fusil.\n\nEn combat, vous pourrez courir et sauter, faire des roulades pour esquiver les attaques, lancer de puissants cris pour attirer les créatures au loin ou effrayer les créatures tentant de vous attaquer, attaquer vos ennemis à coups de hache, tirer à coups de fusil, utiliser les objets que vous aurez achetés au magasin ou même tomber en rage quelques secondes afin d'asséner des coups encore plus puissants aux monstres qui veulent votre peau. Faites attention à votre barre d'énergie; chaque fois que vous faites une action physique (coup de hache, courir, rouler, etc.), vous utiliserez une certaine quantité d'énergie. Une fois la barre vidée, vous serez exténué, et deviendrez une proie facile. Il est important de prendre de petites pauses lorsqu'il est possible pour éviter que cela n'arrive!\n\nUne fois que vous aurez anéanti toutes les vagues de monstres, vous aurez complété la mission. Vos récompenses en sous vous seront alors distribuées, et vous pourrez attaquer le prochain jour pour de nouveaux défis. Il est important de noter que chaque nuit apporte de nouveaux monstres ou de nouvelles possibilités/mécaniques de jeu qui vous demanderont de pouvoir vous adapter rapidement.\n\n\n\nQualité graphique, artistique et sonore\n\nSangFroid_ChargementCertes, les graphismes du jeu ne sont pas les plus beaux, et ce, même si vos paramètres sont au maximum. Les modèles utilisés pour représenter les personnages et les créatures font un boulot très convenable et du moins, le jeu n'est pas laid. L'ambiance générale et le style artistique de Sang-Froid nous permettent d'oublier très facilement les quelques lacunes côté modélisation, textures et animations.\n\nSangFroid_Discussions\n\nMalgré le style artistique intéressant de Sang-Froid, le jeu possède une grosse lacune côté doublage. Malgré le fait que les voix francophones utilisent un français d'antan (ce qui facilite l'immersion d'ailleurs), nous avons l'impression que les acteurs lisent directement un livre sans regarder l'animation des personnages. Également, il est important de noter qu'il n'y a pas beaucoup de cinématiques dans le jeu, le jeu utilisant plus ou moins le même principe que les jeux de "nouvelles interactives" où l'image des personnages est placée au-dessus d'une boîte de texte. Seule différence est que chaque texte est accompagné d'une voix, et que l'image est remplacée par un modèle 3D quelque peu animé.\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nSang-Froid est la preuve que le Québec est capable de grandes choses dans le monde du jeu vidéo. Le petit studio indépendant d'Artifice Studios a su créer un petit bijou que tous les amateurs de jeux de stratégie devraient se procurer. L'univers utilisé pour le jeu est unique et utilise une époque peu exploitée par l'industrie, ce qui lui donne un charme exceptionnel. La qualité graphique du jeu est un peu basse, mais le style artistique de celui-ci nous fait rapidement oublier ces quelques lacunes. Le jeu ne possède pas de modes multijoueurs, mais offre tout de même un excellent facteur plaisir. Nous vous conseillons de vous le procurer dès maintenant!\n\nHISTOIRE/NARRATION - 8.5\nUNIVERS/CONSISTANCE - 10\nPERSONNAGES/ENNEMIS - 9\nQUALITÉ GRAPHIQUE - 8\nQUALITÉ SONORE - 9\nQUALITÉ INTELLIGENCE ARTFICIELLE - 8.5\nFACTEUR REJOUABILITÉ - 7.5\nFACTEUR DIFFICULTÉ - 7\nFACTEUR INNOVATION - 8.5","April 3, 2014","true","6.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Anyone would be excused for thinking of isometric Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) games like LOL or DOTA, or Orcs Must Die where the combat is hectic, constant, fast paced and deals with hundreds of mindless mobs marching towards your side, but Sang-Froid is not. Instead the action is tense, tactical, clever and far more personal.\n\nEvery game, you start off with a top down perspective of a pine forest through which snowy trails wind towards your cabin. They're paths taken by an onslaught of wolves out to tear it down. This is the planning phase. At first, you just need to defend the cabin where your sick sister lies, but soon the barn, mill, church and more buildings get added to the community under your care. Your sister is a special kind of sick however. She can see from where the wolves are coming to attack those buildings and what routes they'll take, through visions.\n\nThis is where the first difference between the game and others like it become apparant: It's personal. When you choose to leave the planning stage and enter the world, the third person hack&slash ensures that your character is the most versatile weapon you have and there really aren't that many wolves, especially in the beginning. Its just that the wolves are capable of coming in from anywhere and your character is just one man with a tiny bar of stamina that can't possibly cover the large stretches of space between buildings AND safely fight more than a few wolves at the same time. And when you do choose to engage, the wolves aren't fodder either. They really are characters in their own right.\n\nPersonal combat is involving. Should they have all pounced at once, they would have torn you apart, but a complex system of fear and intimidation, using roars, fires and actions, will see them circling while you deal with those few who manage the courage to take swipes at you. You are are armed with axe and rifle, but the axe will quickly sap your stamina and your rifle is an antique that requires 10 seconds of loading. Tougher foes arrive by themselves or in pairs, but these are often so durable that they take just as much time as any one of those packs.\nCombat is a long process against worthy foes then, but time isn't something you have as more packs all over the map close in on your buildings.\n\nThis is where the traps come in, and a good deal of patience and savvy from you. Using the planning phase ahead of the third person action phase, allows you to not only prepare your own community through the purchase of gear, but to prepare a strategy for dealing with all of these packs at the same time. And instead of just placing down towers that splash the occasional damage, these traps are of the visceral, personal kind, suited to dealing with a foe that would have given you so much trouble in melee.\n\nBearclaws will instantly kill the four legged wolves. Bait attracts and slows them down, giving you precious extra time. Placing nets with an avalanche of rocks in them high among the treetops, will bury werewolves when timed right. Place kindle in certain passages and set it alight to redirect packs.\nSome of these traps work automatic. Others are far more involving. The net trap for example, needs to be triggered by a shot from your rifle, preferably after luring the werewolf underneath through the use of deception: Bait or a shout to lure it there.\n\nIf there's one thing the game does exceedingly well, it is to establish the relationship between hunter and hunted, or making you feel like a rugged outdoors man triumphing over nature through wit. You are keenly aware of just how frightful and tough a werewolf can be in combat, so seeing it carried off through the air on the sharp tip of a ballista bolt after you've personally set it off and tricked the wolf in the right position is a gleeful moment. The transfer between planning phase where you control the map, and action phase where your control is limited to the range of your gun is a disempowering one. The map is tidy, but on foot, the mill is a world away. All you could do is set some spike traps around it, only to realize you couldn't do the same for the werewolf you are about to face for lack of cash. There's only a bonfire for him, to keep him back. "Will it work?" You will wonder.\n\nIn such a moment, a sudden swish-click-yelp sound in the far distance of the frozen wintersky, will make you smile as you keep warm around the lit bonfire.\n\n\nOther than this, the game itself has charm too. Its not a looker, with somewhat decent animation and bearable graphics. Sometimes, the voice acting is cringe-worthy too, with a cast of would-be native Americans barely able to manage the accent. But a cast there is however, with cutscenes and a story too that - although not particular exciting - perfectly enforces the atmosphere of being a Canadian lumberjack on the frontier of a dangerous wildernesses. The mythology of werewolves and Canadian folklore is handled with careful respect and soon you'll be facing creatures from both British Canadian Christian fables and Native American Folklore. Even items are carefully described for their history in logging and Canadian history. I don't even mind the completely outdated method of clicking on individual buildings when going to town to buy gear. It adds to charm. The sound and music make up for a lot and once you manage to see past the outdated looks, you'll appreciate the cartoony feeling and the perfect v-shaped broom closet that is your main character.\n","January 1, 2014","true","30.2"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/recommended/227220/","Maxmetpt","Maxmetpt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/","704 products in account","Sang-froid is a great game, in concept! The translation of the idea into a videogame is also done well, mechanics-wise.\nThe big problem, for me, is how unpolished and frustrating the execution has been, especially for a 15€ game.\n\nThe game feels dated in almost every respect. Graphics, story-telling, how the combat and guns work, transitions, item system, etc. etc. Everything is very imperfect and takes way more time than it should.\nI don't want to make a full blown review, so I'll try to very briefly state the most glaring problems.\n\nI've played the game twice. Once on Easy Mode, once on Hard Mode. Easy Mode was very uninteresting. Combat over strategy. Hard Mode was infuriating, since, while strategy was the focus, the combat was still very much required to a great degree, while your character was clearly very underpowered. As a result, almost every mission required multiple tries, even after I had the strategy laid and should have worked. I completely ignored the story and all of the other aspects aside from mechanics in the second playthrough.\n\nWhy? Because it's terrible. Honestly. The story is fairly cool, especially since I do like fairy-tale and folk stories, in general. The problem is how the story is delivered. It's... mind boggling to me. The story is told exclusively through "cutscenes" that are merely characters talking to one another. Nothing fancy. The problems are: the writing isn't good, coupled with horrible voice-acting. I don't think the actors were in the same room at all. Each line feels completely disconnected from the situation at hand, and the tone is completely off. It just doesn't deliver.\nThen, there's the fact that, visually, they use some pretty bad 3D models, just because. The animations aren't all that great either. Nothing justifies the choice for these "cutscenes". A simple 2D conversation, with little animation and no voice-acting could have been much more polished without half of the work.\nNot to mention that this had nothing to do with the game. Yet, it's one of the main elements of the product, and it sticks out like a sore thumb.\n\nIt's really, really, bad. I don't understand this choice at all. I could understand a sub-par execution, if it was a new idea, or something. This brings nothing new, nothing impressive. On the contrary, it's glaringly bad...\n\nThe game itself, for those of you not aware, is like Orcs Must Die, although the tower and combat phases are completely separated. First, you place the traps you can. Then, you fight each wave successively, with combat. That's fine, although it can be kind of annoying when you don't know exactly what will come at you (they tell you which enemies and where, but there are nuances...) and you have no chance to fix mistakes without restarting.\n\nYou'll get a plethora of different traps that you can later upgrade, but some of them are mostly useless or situational.\nStill, they fit the setting, and some combinations were fun to use.\n\nYou can also buy potions and weapons in the town. Potions are useless, except from the health ones. The others are burnt money, unless you're on the last missions. Why? Because you barely get any money to upgrade. So, why waste it on consumables?\nYou gain so little money that you'll take until the last few missions to be able to get a decent combination of weapons. Espcially on hard mode.\nFar too long.\n\nThe upgrade system is cool, although you can completely lock yourself if you use your points in the wrong place. You can "undo", but only when you choose where to put them. If you "confirm",you're stuck with them.\n\n\nOk, what's next?\nGraphically, it's a PS2 era game. If that. You can't see 7 meters in front of you, and I'm not sure if it's a design decision, or a performance choice. Then, the game suffers from fps problems when there are too many enemies active. And I have a 3.4Gz quad-core. There's no justification that I can think of, really.\n\nThe combat is extremely clunky. That could be fine, since you're not supposed to use it a lot. Except... that you need to, since traps are very limited. So except lots of restarts. The game has a lock-on system that will often change targets when you least want to. There are some enemies that will go underground to heal when they're low on HP. So, you want to kill them asap.  The problem is: when there are several characters, the game may very well choose to target someone else. Well, crap...\n\nThe gun suffers a similar problem with the auto-aim. It "snaps" to the closest target... sometimes. Sometimes it also seems to lag, and suddenly aims completely off, leading to a failed shot.\n\nYou also take a loooong time to reload, which is cool. Bullets are also fairly expensive, so the point is to hold on to them. Which is infuriating when the game throws your aim off!\n\n\nHere's another thing: the game rewards you for using less traps. You can use Actions Points to cut trees, instead of placing traps. This further encourages combat, rather than strategy. Encourages the clunkiest system... And unbalances the game has a result, a bit. On Hard Mode, where you want to maximize traps, you end up getting way less money, making it even harder to upgrade, thus making the future missions even harder.\nThere's a bit of a snowball effect, here... and not a good one.\n\n\nThen, there are various other problems. The interface is big and full of boxes, and still manages to miss several very important aspects... You take far too long to navigate from the stores to the village and your home. It's the clicking, but there are way too many. There's also a lot of information missing, leading to even more time wasted...\nThere's no plain restart button that starts you exactly at the level you were in. You always have to go to the strategy screen, and then click like 3 or 4 times to confirm textboxes before you go into the level. It doesn't help that there's always a load screen between transitions. So, except 2 loading screens every time you make a mistake and want to restart. Or simply die...\n\n\nI realize this review is a bit toxic. I apologize for that. The game isn't terrible. The game itself, if I ignore everything else, can be fun and challenging, at times. The problem is that the game has way too many issues in too many different places, and it results in a very frustrating experience, overall.\nIt tries to do a lot more than the game itself, but it doesn't know how. Seems like a lot of wasted work. I just can't understand the people claiming it to be a "masterpiece".\nIn concept, it's great. Execution... not really.\n\nOrcs Must Die is a far more enjoyable game (both of them, in my opinion) and they provide more content than this, for a lower or equal price. And undoubtedly more finely tuned and polished.","July 16, 2015","false","22.2"," 12 of 24 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","12","24","0","0"

I doubt the developers played through their own tutorial. You get a short video when a decent item description would have done the job. Rather than encouraging players to explore, the game assumes the player is a ♥♥♥♥♥ and tells you exactly what to do, step by step for the first 3 levels. That is in addition to the pop-up tutorials every 20 feet. If you think the gamers will be too stupid to figure out your game, maybe the solution is to make the mechanic more intuitive, not have 2 dozen videos explaining various concepts peppered in waypoints.\n\nThe game does get more challenging and fun later on but the interface remains clunky. The game is plagued with interface issues: you can undo traps but not work, the hud favors artistic flare to actually providing information (health bar most guilty), you have to navigate through a half dozen buildings in town for upgrades and items, even though it could have easily all been fit into a single interface.\n\nThe game lauds it's exciting and epic story. Yet aside from an awesome opening cinematic, the game chooses to tell the story in laughable animations. They are poorly dialogued, occur much too frequently and worse, doesn't inform or drive gameplay at all. They break up the pacing of the game and most of the characters are one dimensional. Instead of a handful (yes more than 1) of animations every level, a cinematic every 5 would have been amazing.\n\nI bought Sangfroid expecting an exciting indie game with fresh gameplay. The gameplay mechanics are pretty interesting, maybe even enough so to be called unique and exciting. But the rest of the game feels just like the bloated mess out of major studios. If this is an indie game, it most certainly doesn't feel like one. Gameplay was the coin spent to purchase all the frills in the game.","February 2, 2014","false","4.1"," 13 of 27 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","13","27","0","0"

The reason being that it contains some of the worst writing and the very worst voice acting I have ever witnessed anywhere. Storyline could be passable were it not for the instantly despisable characters and their pathetic attempts at emotion. Perhaps if you can ignore such aspects, you might enoy this game but if the story and its pieces mean anything to you, avoid it.","February 6, 2014","false","0.8"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PandaLiz/recommended/227220/","PandaLiz","PandaLiz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PandaLiz/","211 products in account","Ultimately this game was well thought, and put together. Although if they had just put some extra time to fix the minor things could have been much better. When I first start the game, it takes about 1-2 minutes to get past the load screen when I have 200 fps. Now, I'd be more okay with sitting in a load screen for 1-2 minutes if there was actually something going on, or had better music. It plays the same sound track that is about 20-30 seconds long on loop till you get past the load screen. Then you jump straight into a cut scene that doesn't make much sense till you play the more of the game. Although if you don't take the time to play the game you won't find out why they threw a random cut scene in your face. Warning, when werewolves come they're loud as all hell can get. I have my setting on low for sound effects and music and my computer volume at 5 and it sounds as if there was a actual wolf howling in my ear. That ♥♥♥♥ is loud.\n\nYou get about 2 charaters that you can pick from, either are large burly man or a smaller man. They show a girl, that at first I thought you could play, but when I hovered over her, I couldn't. Now, I haven't played very much of the game, so maybe later in the game you can play the charater later on.\n\nCut scenes from what I have seen I am not pleased with. I hear 2 different pitches from just being in a regular game, to a cut scene the voice can have a different pitch or almost sound completely different. From seeing the first cut scene within the first few seconds I expected lips to move at least. If you look close enough, sure you can see 100 pixels move, but it doesn't look like a lip is actually move, but just glitching. They show other larger things moving in the cut scene, but what I couldn't understand is not a simple lip movement?\n\nThere was a very small story from what I was getting at. The usual werewolves are destroying farms etc. So, I would strongly reccomend against buying this game for the story line, because it's mainly a tower defense game.\n\nThe actual gameplay it's self is very well put together. Will I be playing more of this game, probably. The way they did the traps, was some what acurate, but well thought for the game, so that wolves don't just go "HAH ♥♥♥♥ YOUR TRAP". They also didn't make the traps insanly over powered. Now, there are different leveled wolves which makes the game more interesting and makes you think more about how to place things, because if you place things in then wrong spot you can lose the night. The game is pretty much a 3rd Person, Strategy, Tower Defense game. I would reccomend the game to those who enjoy games that you need to think, and just run around in cirlces in. Like I said the game was well put together, and unique for how they did this.","June 8, 2015","true","0.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","2"

But that's exactly what appealed to me! Mind you ,i played with Jack on the first run(basically,hardest mode),and finding that perfect combination of traps,your combat presence,and sequence in which you deal with multiple waves was the best feeling(loved the zipline towers,allowed for more challenging maps).The "fear" mechanic brings much needed order and planning into combat,minimizing risk of botching a good run if you prepared beforehand.\nDon't forget that Orc Mus Die also have its "perfect builds",which you tend to fall back into and raise the tedium aspect.\n\nOverall, i recommend this for "perfectionist" type of players,who love tower defense genre,but just about ready to play more experimental mix. Don't worry, combat here is  more tactical then it tends to be in these types of games(Sanctum,OMD).\nPS:You mind need to work a bit on your aim though,reload times are crippling early on.","December 31, 2013","true","9.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

If I had to name one game that is similiar to this one it would probably be Orcs Must Die!, but it is still very very different.\n\nSang-Froid's setting is enough to make it stand out from the rest. The story being told takes us back to the times where the northern american settlers lived aside native indians. The player plunges into the role of one of the two O'Carroll brothers, forced to fight for the life of their ill sister and their own as well.\n\nGame consists of two distinct parts - the 'tactical' phase, taking place at dawn and the 'action' phase where our tactical plan is being put to test. Would you expect Orcs Must Die ! clone, you'd be up for a big suprise, a selection of deadly machines that chew, chop and incinerate mindless hordes of enemies is replaced by simplistic traps, overhang nets filled with stones and baits that only slow down your enemies. Most of the traps are disposed after being used and aside from a handful barely useful tools, they require to be set off manually with a painfully slow reloading rifle.\n\nWell, the game is difficult. An easy setting (represented by Joe, the burly O'Caroll brother) turns out to be nowhere near easy. On the other hand failure comes free-of-charge and you can repeat and rethink your tactics infinitely, as long as you're not satisfied with the success. There's nothing cheap about the challenge, not Borderlands 2 half-♥♥♥♥♥ design or numbers ridicule. It takes a bit of thought to survive each night, but it's both satisfying and rewarding once you make it.\n\nObviously the game is not perfect. A little rough round the edges, some animations could be a tad more refined and so on - but that's nothing you wouldn't expect from an indie game coming from a very small studio. My biggest gripe is the awful voice acting which does nothing but hinders the story told. I'd glad with no va at all, in favour of the subtitles, unfortunately the option isn't there. On the other hand the folkish score is loveable and really adds to an already great package.\n\nBottom line: buy it, these guys deserve your support.

This mechanic can create some really tense moments as you frantically struggle to reload your flintlock rifle, or try to get away to a well booby-trapped spot on the farm before the hairy hordes close in for the kill.\nFrom historically accurate weapons and equipment to an easy to access resource management element, there is plenty to keep the player engrossed in many hours of werewolf bashing.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PandaLiz/recommended/227220/","PandaLiz","PandaLiz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PandaLiz/","211 products in account","Ultimately this game was well thought, and put together. Although if they had just put some extra time to fix the minor things could have been much better. When I first start the game, it takes about 1-2 minutes to get past the load screen when I have 200 fps. Now, I'd be more okay with sitting in a load screen for 1-2 minutes if there was actually something going on, or had better music. It plays the same sound track that is about 20-30 seconds long on loop till you get past the load screen. Then you jump straight into a cut scene that doesn't make much sense till you play the more of the game. Although if you don't take the time to play the game you won't find out why they threw a random cut scene in your face. Warning, when werewolves come they're loud as all hell can get. I have my setting on low for sound effects and music and my computer volume at 5 and it sounds as if there was a actual wolf howling in my ear. That ♥♥♥♥ is loud.\n\nYou get about 2 charaters that you can pick from, either are large burly man or a smaller man. They show a girl, that at first I thought you could play, but when I hovered over her, I couldn't. Now, I haven't played very much of the game, so maybe later in the game you can play the charater later on.\n\nCut scenes from what I have seen I am not pleased with. I hear 2 different pitches from just being in a regular game, to a cut scene the voice can have a different pitch or almost sound completely different. From seeing the first cut scene within the first few seconds I expected lips to move at least. If you look close enough, sure you can see 100 pixels move, but it doesn't look like a lip is actually move, but just glitching. They show other larger things moving in the cut scene, but what I couldn't understand is not a simple lip movement?\n\nThere was a very small story from what I was getting at. The usual werewolves are destroying farms etc. So, I would strongly reccomend against buying this game for the story line, because it's mainly a tower defense game.\n\nThe actual gameplay it's self is very well put together. Will I be playing more of this game, probably. The way they did the traps, was some what acurate, but well thought for the game, so that wolves don't just go "HAH ♥♥♥♥ YOUR TRAP". They also didn't make the traps insanly over powered. Now, there are different leveled wolves which makes the game more interesting and makes you think more about how to place things, because if you place things in then wrong spot you can lose the night. The game is pretty much a 3rd Person, Strategy, Tower Defense game. I would reccomend the game to those who enjoy games that you need to think, and just run around in cirlces in. Like I said the game was well put together, and unique for how they did this.","June 8, 2015","true","0.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","2"

You play as one of the O'caroll brothers who ends up defending their sister from werewolves. In this game, the story of these werewolves and wolves is that they are under the control of the devil. Werewolves are created from souls of sinners that are expelled as they sleep and then merge into a wolf, creating the humanoid wolves you fight, but there are a range of other creatures to fight which have their own weaknesses and strengths in reguards to how traps effect them, in lures work and what might do more damage.\n\nThe story is very good and the switching between axes (holy for one type, silver for others) and preparing traps makes the stategy all the more interesting. There are also three types of bullets. normal, holy and silver which have their uses, however the rifles they use are old fashioned musket rifles so you will need to make sure that one shot counts and kills whatever you are shooting at. The only things that let it down is it suffers from Brutal Legend's idea of replaying missions where if you do it, you erase all data of the missions you completed after that and so you can potentially farm xp or cash to help you in the final battle or just to improve yourself in the events, however unlike Brutal Legend you are given a clear warning before doing this. Buy this as soon as possible, I highly recommend it!","November 5, 2013","true","14.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

As an action tower defense game you can't avoid comparing Sang-Froid to Orcs Must Die. However, these games are very different in gameplay and layout. In Sang-Froid you prepare all your traps before starting the level in contrast to OMD where you start the level and then place traps. In that manner Sang-Froid is a little more slow paced and not quite hectic as OMD, but enough with the comparison. Let's focus on Sang-Froid alone.\n\nThe story isn't the strongest side of Sang-Froid and the same could be said about the voice acting and cut-scenes. On the contrary the music is really great and it's a perfect fit for the game. The surroundings and the environment also suits this game nicely. I really like the cold, snowy lumberjack theme. The game evolves around one single map which you play every mission. It could let you to believe it would get boring quickly, but the map changes enough along with the objectives that it doesn't feel boring.\n\nThe traps offer a good variety of different killing possibilities. You can upgrade weapons and traps for the fur you sell after killing wolves or werewolves. You could also buy potions and other useful item between each level.\n\nWhat I would like to have seen is that when you play the game the second time with the other brother you know all traps, how the map works etc. but you have to listen to how to use the traps again. It would have been nice to have these things unlocked after you beat the game once. Also, a co-op mode would have been a nice feature. Perhaps in a sequel? Or as the story in this game turn out, a prequel would be more fitting...\n\nAll in all, I thoroughly enjoyed this game and it was well worth the money.","December 31, 2013","true","32.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

That is because, like there, you deal with enemies posing real threat by preparing in advance. Each enemy has it's own quirks, strenghts, and weaknesses, and while they are not as tough as the videos make them look, they do pose enought threat to make you want to adapt to those strenghts and weaknesses.\n\nWhat makes the game hardly replayable is the fact that it's a lot more learning curve dependant than an average game. So for example, you'll get your fun from figureing out the way to get 5 enemies with one spike trap, but once you know how it's done there's nothing notably satisfying about that any more.\n\nThe story and visual style also remind me of the original witcher somewhat. That is because, like there, they are not "hollywoodish", which is a compliment in itself, if you ask me. Noting else good to say about them though - the game is visualy poor and pale. And the story is bad in more ways than one... Rarely have I seen a story that's both religious enough to irritate atheists, ocult/blasthemous enoght to irritate monotheists, plain enoght to bore the fans of the mistic themes, and bland enoght not to impress a casual reader. I seriously can't imagine what they were thinking while making a game with that story...\n\n\n\nThat said, the games are meant to be played, not read or watched or heard (btw, the soundtrack here is great, if you ask me), and this game is worth playing.","December 23, 2013","true","36.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Yeah, it had good music and nifty art, but the positivity stops there.\n\nThere were more glitches in the first 20 minutes of play than you could find in any other 3 alpha-stage games combined. The combat system fell so far bad, it actually took away from the game. I play PC games quite often, even some twitch-shooters, and I have never seen lag like this. It takes roughly 2-4 seconds for any single command I make to be enacted in game.\n\nI thoroughly hope the developers will spend a little more time fixing this one. Maybe they can polish this up and turn it into an enjoyable gaming experience and have it back in our hands. Until then, I consider this game a full waste of my funds, and will not even attempt to open the file again.","January 28, 2014","false","1.1"," 13 of 28 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","13","28","0","2"

It starts you off in a child-like hand holding tutorial which you must suffer through. The tutorial is explained by an older gentleman in segmented videos. This format leaves absolutely no room for learning or experimentation. The hand holding doesn't stop with the tutorial vidoes either; through out the game you are constantly bombarded by annoying pop ups containing tips.\n\nAnother problem, although small, and perhaps unimportant to some, is the poor voice acting, which is painfully apparent. This is honestly some of the worst voice acting I've ever encountered. The acting and dialogue feels incredibly forced and not fluid at all. This lack of fluidity also applies to the cutscenes and animations. The combination of all this makes it impossible for me to be invested in the story.\n\nI was expecting the saving grace for this game to be the combat, unforunately, the combat is actually shallow and uneventful. With the assisted aiming and large packs of enemies, fighting foes turns into a mouse clicking fest in which you will find yourself monotonously smashing the attack button. There is a "fear" mechanic which is meant to play in with the stamina feature. Enemies have a "fear" meter that slowly builds. Upon reaching a certain point of fear, the animal will then attack. In the time spent waiting for an animal's fear to rise to an attacking point, you'll have time to reload your rifle and let your stamina regenerate. So by the time the enemy comes to attack, you're already fully loaded and prepared, which really dictates the pace of fighting into an almost turn based setting. I have no qualms with the day time planning strategizing portion of the combat.\n\nWhen you combine all these problems with the unintersting and sporadic story, you feel left with a half-♥♥♥♥♥ game with poor atmosphere.\n\nUltimately, I can only reccomend this game to children, or perhaps even first time gamers who need generous doses of help and guiding.","September 24, 2014","false","1.3"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

It really makes an interesting universe until you actually do start controlling your chosen character then it really goes down hill.\n\nGameplay comes down to building defenses and then defending the buildings your supposed to. Early on this isn't so bad until you start hitting 3 or more buildings where you have to defend them all and they are all vastly far from eachother and in the event of one being destroyed you lose so you end up having to do a bit of multi tasking in order to keep everything together and this can require trial and error as you figure out what will work and what wont for each mission.\n\nThe combat though is very floaty and dousn't feel very solid. If I didn't know better I would think you weren't actually supposed to go into direct combat with enemies since it feels very poor when compared to the presentation quality of the rest of the game. Its clunky and at times it can be difficult to hit enemies with your melee attack and in the process get hit yourself. Some of the aspects like fear and rage are very interesting but unfortunately managing these aspects on top of the combat on top of defending your buildings isn't really fun after a time as you battle with the clunkiness while trying to do everything before one of your buildings die.\n\nThe pacing really becomes a problem at the point where the game becomes challenging as it gets so slow that the high points are not high enough to actually make it worth it.\n\nSo maybe I will someday play more of Sang Froid but for now I really have no impetus to play more of it and would rather just like to see the story play out but not enough to actually beat the game.\n\nAlso for as basic as the graphics are its very poorly optimized. Many basic video settings such as windowed mode are not supported either. So once you start peeling back the facade the lack of structure shows. As an analogy I think that fits this game at where I am in it.","September 12, 2014","false","4.9"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

The leveling system seemed pretty advanced, and the gameplay and characters were comically stupid.  While the mecanics worked fairly well, the game really seemed to lack story, or  a drive to continue playing.  The game was ok... While I can not recommend this game simply because I'm not a fan of tower defense, but what I can say is, for those that enjoy this type of gameplay and gamestyle, it is definatly worth checking out.","July 7, 2014","false","1.1"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Read this here like as if you lived in newfoundland or newbunswick b'y.\n\nI can't say I would git dis her game I tell ya, shes too bland and boring in my opinion b'y.\n\nOld gritty graphics that are outdated and not even enjoyable in that way, nothing positive about that. The gameplay is slightly boring and just bleh. You will deal with just a mess of monsters coming from every direction you can think of, up, down, left, right, rileft, up der b'y.\n\nHas a nice talent tree with good customization and plenty of traps and weapons to play with, giving you a decent toolshed of death to kill native werewolfs and the devils monsters. You can go to town and buy more bullets for your musket, dip your axe in holy water to deal extra damage, buy alcohols or clothing to help your defense and offense and use unique items to change the winds path or other fun stuff.\n\nIts simple, easy to pick up and has a decent tutorial to teach you what the hell is going on, but it just was not for me and I say look up the screenshots and maybe check out a video or two, I got it on sale for 2$ CANADIAN so I won't hurt too much up here in the north.\n\nPersonal Rating: 2/5","December 4, 2015","false","5.1"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

In fact, both elements are constantly tripping the other up.\n\nBasic premise: You defend various buildings against monster (mostly wolves and werewolves during the night, and build/upgrade during the day. You kill monsters with both traps and your axe/musket.\n\nOn the surface it's a great idea for a game. You're trapped in spooky isolated woods and during the day you have to spend your limited time choosing how to survive the coming sunset.\n\nWhy it fails is because the 3rd person movement and controls are so sluggish, the map is far too spread out, and the majority of the traps require you to be present in order to take effect but you can't be everywhere at once.\n\n3rd person action: super clunky melee swings and musket reloading. I realize it's not going to be as fast paced and adreniline pumping as a dedicated action game, but if it's going to be THIS clunky and boring then they should have just ditched it to make this a full on tower defense strategy game. You're not shooting huge guns like Sanctum, you're dealing with clunky axe swinging. There's a system where you have to manage the wolves' fear level; keep them afraid enough so the entire pack doesn't jump you at once. This might have been interesting in a game with better combat, but it's just frustrating because you don't have time to deal with it because your other building are all the way across the map.\n\nOverly large map: The full map (once all locations open up) is larger than most DotA maps and it takes a good 2 minutes to traverse the entire thing. It's way too slow and you have to be everywhere at once. Later on you can build ziplines to travel quicker, but then you have to sit through the slow climbing animations like it's a Zelda game, plus the ziplines cannot go through trees and the whole map in one winding forest. Since it's 3rd person, you can only see what's in sight of your character and have little idea what's happening other than some icons on the map. This is a big problem because...\n\nNon-automated traps: The majority of the traps in the game require you to be present in order to work. You must shoot ropes to drop rocks on wolves. You must light bonfires. You must man turrets. The whole point of traps should be to cover areas you can't be at. If they can't do that then what's the point and why not just make it a full on action game? There are a couple traps that theoretically take care of things when you're not there, but they're unreliable. You can lay down flaming trenches that monsters can't cross, but it's very hard to tell if the trench is completely blocking off a path or if there's one tiny pixel you missed that monsters can pass through, derailing your entire plan and forcing you to start over. Likewise with lethal traps. You can place 3 lethal traps at a chokepoint and sometimes all the monsters will run into them, sometimes none. It's totally random which is the opposite of what a good tower defense game should be.\n\nThe story: The devil is summoning monsters to attack you. That's the entire story, but they drag it out with non-animated, horribly acted, boring cutscene after cutscene.\n\n\nThere was a kernal of a good game idea buried in here somewhere. If they were going to make so many traps reliant on you being present, they should have turned it into primarily an action game. If the action was going to suck so much they should have turned it into a pure strategy game. In trying to do both they compromised each other.","September 29, 2014","false","1.8"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","2"

LOVE IT!\nThe creators have done a fantastic job at so many aspects of this game.\n1.The music and sound design are great.\n2.They mix story, strategy with some good hands on fighting and killing of wolves!\n3. IN GAME VIDEO TUTORIALS that take you step by step through each aspect of how to play and what each thing does.\nThey don't just leave you hanging, they take you thorugh several games and mission with a video showing what you need to know, how to do it, and then let you try it. These aren't just static images. These are fully voiced and animated lessons for everything you need to know!

The music is certainly the best part of the game.  I'll give a nod to the interesting art design as well, but the execution is pretty sub-par.\n\nThe game itself is a mashup of tower defense and third person brawler/shooter, with the map you're defending expanding after each round as you unlock new tools and resources.  There's promise there, but it's poorly delivered on and ultimately provides a choppy and inconsistant experience.\n\nThe plot is... bad.  It's bad.  It's reall, really, so very bad.  It seems promising at the start, but by the second or third round it's almost bad enough to be ironically entertaining.  The devil is particularly amusing, while the depiction of the natives actually verges on upsetting.\n\nThere are better games out there that deliver on this mechanical concept more fluidly, and there are better stories about werewolves in frontier times.

When I first saw it, I wasn't sure if it was an action-style RPG, or what it was, but when I actually PLAYED it, the horrible truth dawned on me... it's a focking tower defence game! Now, I'm no stranger to the TD-genre, both the armchair general type where you just place towers/turrets/whatever down on a map to stop/kill the incoming enemies (Defence Grid or Plants VS Zombies), and the "up close and personal" kind where you actually get to do some runnin' 'n' gunnin' yourself (Orcs Must Die! and Sanctum), but Sang-Froid isn't really either.\n\nTaking enemies on in a head-to-head fight is to say the bloody least STU-PID unless they're just basic wolves and you're playing as Jos, AND WHY WOULDN'T YOU, SINCE HE'S APPARENTLY BETTER THAN WEAK-MODE JAQ IN EVERY SINGLE WAY!!! Anyway, where was I... oh, yeah. Sang-Froid's gameplay. It's an interesting enough concept, but the execution is like a wobbly, woinky... something. Basically, it's flawed as all FOCK! The music isn't BAD, but it's nowhere near GOOD either, and the cutscenes honestly look like they were made with cardboard cut-outs of the various characters, i.e. they're basically shïte.

On with the review now...\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nThe game itself is pretty unique as you have hack and slash battles and first person shooter elements combined with some tower defence aspects like traps and buildings that you must defend from the invaders and lots of upgradeable abilities thrown in for good measure. The music and voice acting compliment the game ambiance in all the tongues available. The story is created in part by Bryan Perro who is famous around here in Quebec.\n\nIn short you shoot werewolves after luring them under and around all sorts of traps that you acquire as you progress into the game and unravel the mystery that surrounds the town of Val-des-loups (Ancient town that no longer exist here in Quebec).

It is a TD/action game and both aspects are done in a way that suck balls. The melee combat just feels awkward and the TD aspect is boring and not done well compared to other games such as Dungeon Defenders.\n\nI realize this got a 79/100 metacritic average and I even read in the forums someone saying they have 321 hours in it but despite trying to force myself to like this I can't. The first hour of the game is about 30 minutes of tutorials/interruptions, 10 minutes of cutscenes, and 20 minutes of gameplay which is about 5-10 minutes on the planning screen/in town and 10-15 short minutes of actual gameplay. It feels like the whole game is about 50% TD/action and 50% adventure game and adventure games blow. Maybe as you play on and get the five thousand tutorials out of the way, there is more gameplay. The game just has such a bad indie game feel I couldn't stand it long enough to find out. HOW IN GOD'S NAME DID THIS GET A 79 META AVERAGE???\n\nThe action game part, melee combat, is imo poorly done. Just feels awkward and clunky. Also, my guy can swing only a few times at a wolf before running out of stamina, like he smokes nine packs of cigarettes a day and has trouble breathing or something. I am out of shape badly and I could swing an axe at wolves for a good long while before I was out of breath. Combat just feels generically done. And mouse control does not feel right either because it A) uses mouse acceleration to spin the camera faster the quicker you move it and B) also does not have sensitivity matched up right on the axis'. X axis (left & right) is fine but Y axis (up & down) is too low and it makes a odd matchup and feels awful, and there are no options in the game to change it. When they can't even make the controls feel normal, that is bad news.\n\nThe planning screen where you lay traps looks like crap, and all other menu screens have a crap look and feel about them. Where good games look smooth and crisp in their menu's, this one's presentation value is just sharp, dull, and ugly. That leads to the other part of the game, tower defense mechanics, which suck balls. After laying down traps and nets and stuff, I start and since they are coming from 3 different paths all over the map and the traps don't do anything whatsoever but slow them down slightly, it's like where the fk do I go first? So I pick a spot and go fight a werewolf. While I am doing that, the traps I put down slowed the others only barely so the houses are getting attacked now. The net traps I put down are hard to get anything to go underneath, especially when it says my shout isn't ready yet and I don't even think I used it yet. The wolves usually just walk passed my net trap so it is a waste and I just killed them with the clunky crap balls melee fighting.\n\nIf you want a TD/action game that is properly reviewed as a good game, try Dungeon Defenders. If you want a TD/action game that all the reviewers played blindfolded, play this. I mean it honest to God boggles my mind as to how this game got a 79 metacritic average. The melee and TD portions of the game are both a nightmare compared to Dungeon Defenders.\n\n5/10, if that.","June 22, 2014","false","1.5"," 1 of 10 people (10%) found this review helpful","10","1","10","0","0"

Yes, videos.\nThe artwork is confusing and with no continuity (you have a certain style for the menu, another different one for the animations, another one for the loading screens....), quite upleasant, seems like three or four different artists put their hands on this, only to eventually merge everything together.\nThe concept is nice, I like the theme that made get this, I wouldn't complain as I got it on sale but it isn't anywhere close to worth the full price.","November 1, 2014","false","0.8"," 2 of 15 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","2","15","0","0"

The acting is bad to the point of laughable. Think the old Resident Evil games. The story telling is very confusing, too; at least the part that I got to. It's unoptimized to the point of getting 30 fps on a decent rig (I can get 60 on TF2 at max graphics) and the controls are horrific. The button layout itself isn't the problem, it's the input delay. You press your attack button then 1.5 seconds later, it finally happens. I crashed twice: once during the initial loading screen (that went on for 4 min) and once during gameplay. You know what unplayable games always score? 0/10 It's a shame, too. This was the most impressive greenlight game I had seen at the time and I waited a long time...for this.

While othing seemed mechanicly wrong with the game from the get go, nothing really stood out to me either as anything worthwhile. However with a recent sale, and a good friend of mine recomending it every chance he got, I decided to pick the game of and give it an honest chance\n\nThe first thing I'll mention aout the game is that while the combat has a clunky feel to it, it's surprisingly enjoyable and really fits the theme of the game, if theirs any time I found myself frustrated with an outcome in combat it was because I hadn't managed properly and felt the weight of it come crashing down on me. You play one of two lumberjacks fighting the Devil and his werewolf, spirit army. Pretty badass concept but it's up to you to be the badass of the story, the game won't do it for you.\n\nResource management is key to winning this game, and the trap and resource system is set up harsh but fairly. You really need to pay atention to what your actually able to spend on upgrading your personal gear like weapons, protective clothing and consumables, because while a good axe or rifle may come in handy, they only help you against one or two enemies before your overwhelmed, however a proper trap could take out four enemies in one go, nothing beats a properly executed trap.\n\nThe game also has a fear system, allowing you to scare off certain enemies , and help even the odds against the packs of wolves that often surround you. Alot of enjoyment is to be found making your enemies hesitate to atack you and start having to size you up before their confident enough to strike again.\n\nLastly but cerainly not least is the soundtrack to this game. This game has one of the best soundracks I've ever heard. It definitely has music you can stomp your foot to (I speak from experience on this.) The music of this game brings everything to another lvel, it makes combat even more enoyable, it gives you a goo sense of the world, and it's just plain fun to listen too.\n\nIn short Sang-Froid is a challenging but rewarding game that offers fun gameplay, a badass story, and some of the best music you'll ever hear in a video game, if not just in general. I'd recomend this game to anyone who likes a nice challenge and is a fan of strategy. I'd give Sang-Froid an 8/10. It's not the highest budjet game, but you most certainly et your dollars worth for it, most of that with the soundtrack alone.","December 8, 2014","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even then at the 15 dollar mark I was strongly considering the purchase if the game turned out to be good fun. Sadly, the game flew in under my radar on release and I forgot all about it until I noticed it at the top of the User Review list on the Steam sales page.\n\nYou play as one of two brothers living in the woods on the outskirts of Wolvesdale, somewhere in Canada. The winters are harsh here and the prowling wolves even harsher. Lil' Jos, the burly big brother is more than capable of whopping wolves with his axe, shooting them with his musket, and setting traps. The other Brother, Jack, is a more frail sort and you will have to lean heavily on your ingenuity with traps to succeed with Jack as your choice.\n\nAt the start of the game you are first introduced to Jack and soon thereafter, Jos and their sister Josephine. Josephine has come down with a fever after a travesty at the local church parish involving the pastor. I won't spoil the story for you, as it does a fine job of effortlessly tossing the Christian and pagan at you without being heavy handed or conciously offensive. Christian motifs figure prominently in the story as well as pagan and Native American belief. The characters are well done and push the story along quite well.\n\nJosephine begins to prophecy foreboding events and the two brothers resolve to get her to town for medical treatment. After the nearby bridge has mysteriously burned down, events begin to domino toward ever more sinister happenings. You'll face two varieties of wolves, 2 varieties of werewolves, and a handful of other mythical creatures such as the Amerindian 'Maikan" which amounts to their verison of the werewolf myth, as well as Will-o-Wisps and the like. The Devil plays a major role and is puppetering the corrupted pastor and townsfolk to play out his wicked game in an attempt to destroy the townsfolk, the brothers and their sister. The writing is solid and the voice acting is competent. I'm enjoying the cutscenes story unfold into the missions you are tasked with.\n\nThe main game consists of a pre-game tactical strategy map where you purchase and place any number of devious traps to incapacitate and dispose of the hellish fiends. The game has a good learning curve and introduces you to the myriad devices slowly; as it should. This aspect of the game is very reminiscient of the Bullfrog Dungeon Master games of years gone by. Great fun is to be had plotting your tactics to deal with the many waves of enemies that are tasked with destroying your assorted buildings. To write of all the many traps and how to use them would amount to a miniature FAQ and so I will leave much of that to you, dear reader, to research. To say the developers gave you a treasure trove of gadgets is putting it mildly.\n\nAt the beginning of each match you are also able to use the money you acquire from defeating the creatures to purchase better weapons, ammo and gear. A coventry nearby can bless your bullets or axes, respectively, so as to deal greater damage to the diabloical creatures. The general store sells an ever increasing number of muskets that have authentic descriptions of their real world counterparts with some very nifty trivia thrown in. You also can purchase new gear and ammo. And the hotel furnishes you with an assortment of liquors that have varying effects on your character in battle.\n\nDuring the match proper, you will be scurrying as your very life does depend on it. Following the routes you planned during the pre-game phase you will have to be front and center for certain traps to be effective. The deadly net trap requires you to shoot the net and drop it on the creatures below. If you have a bait present under the net you simply take your time and fire. Otherwise, you'll have to get crafty and 'shout' for your enemy to come inspect the area. Bonfires help buff the 'fear factor' that  keeps the creatures at a distance as they prowl slowly around you looking to strike. During this time you can reload your musket and go for the headshot without worrying about being ripped to shreds.  Fire walls can be strategically placed to alter the route of your enemy. Watchtowers with ziplines to other parts of the map are a lifesaver when you need to 'be there' quickly to prevent destruction of your precious buildings. This is only a smattering of the many traps available. Nevermind all the possibilities on how to use them in conjunction with each other.\n\nAnd I haven't even touched on the player levels. Much like an RPG, you earn experience points that allow you to upgrade many traits. Typical character buffs like more health, stamina, and the like as well as quicker reloading and stronger traps are available. But there are also quite a few unique buffs such as poisoned bait that damages the devouring creature or increasing the damage done as a 'sniper' if you should decide to try for a shot from one of your watchtowers.\n\nI could go on and on about all the neat features of this game with impunity. The game is well balanced and is a blast to play once you grasp the game mechanics. Most of the game elements will feel familiar to the hobby gamer. But by combining them in such a manner requires an enjoyable pause for thought that many modern games no longer ask of you. To have my intelligence and keyboard savvy simultaneously challenged has been a real treat.  The art style is charming and the music very well done. The graphics are rather modest for a modern game and have a World of Warcraft nature to them but serve the game quite well.  Artifice Studio is officially on my list of promising developers to watch.\n\nI cannot recommend this game strongly enough. Especially for the money. A MUST BUY!","October 2, 2014","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/_4rc_/recommended/227220/","_4rc_","_4rc_","http://steamcommunity.com/id/_4rc_/","81 products in account","Summary of the game (no spoilers). At first, my review was positive, but then I changed my mind. Here is why -\n\n\nStory 3/5  -> Original, somewhat engaging, but a bit shallow\n\nGraphics 4/5 -> for an action/tower defence game pretty decent\n\nVoice acting/ cinematics 1/5 -> terrible voice acting, but that is not such a big deal. Cinematics are a nusiance.\n\nGameplay 2/5 -> You want to play. You want to think about the layout of your traps and strategy. But the game will not let you. It is very easy to place the traps, and melee combat is mostly about going near enemy, hitting MB1 (your character will target and hit enemy automatically, even if they are behind you) and sometimes dodging or running away. Shooting would be more fun, but you need to reload every shot which takes way too long for practical purposes and is impossible in melee combat. You can not place traps exactly where you want them, (I am not talking about terrain restriction now), so they happen to be too much to sides for maximizing their potential - and that is just irritating. You also keep XP even from nights you fail, so you are rewarded for failing. It also makes the game less chalenging, which sux.\n\nIn-game mechanics and options 5/5 -> there is everything that fits the atmosphere and nothing more that could disturb or overhype it. It is detailed, but not overdone, they put a lot of time into it and they did a good job. It also works quite well, I only saw one or two minor bugs. + they explain the mechanics very well.\n\nSaves and loads mechanics 0/5 -> Daytime starts by cinematics, after that you tend to plant traps for waves of enemies that come at night. There may be 1-6 waves each night. If you screw up even the last wave, you need to start from daytime again (you can relocate the traps) and go again through all the waves. If, however, you decide to turn the game off, it will start with the beginning cinematics of the day the next time you play it, and your traps will be deleted, so you need to place them again. The game loads extremely slowly for such a small game, but the loading song makes up for it.\n\nFun 3/5 -> This game had great potential. It could have been so much better, perhaps the most complete tower defence / action game hybrid ever made. After a few rounds (when my review was positive) I had great expectations and was looking forward to playing this game. But as I played, it was becoming somehow irritating because of the factors mention above. Still, it was a decent game.\n\nShoul you buy it? No. It is definitely not worth the price.\n\nHowever, If you see it on a sale like -80% or so, then YES, you will not regret it.","December 27, 2014","false","14.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I went into it thinking that it would be like Orcs Must Die but with werewolves, which sounded like a pretty awesome premise; instead, it turned out to be a clunky, dull action game with strategy and RPG overtones.\n\nThe worst part of the game for me is the interface. The font used was definitely picked for style rather than legibility, making it tricky to get a quick read on your ammo count. The health bar is a strange, bifurcated heart which again is not helpful for at-a-glance info. You wield two weapons, but instead of using a toggle, weapon selection is modal. You have to hold down a key to keep the rifle out. Reloading the rifle is boosted by button mashing which is an egregiously stupid mechanic. The whole town's worth of shops could have been condensed into a single screen. The fear factor UI is painfully unintuitive but works decently once explained. I think even the developers realised how bad the UI is because the tutorial is filled with videos describing in elaborate detail how everything works. When you've gotten to that step, you need to seriously rethink your design decisions.\n\nThe gameplay is where things really fell apart. It seems like most traps are one-use-only which kills the tower defence feeling for me. Because you can't rely on traps, you need to dispatch a good chunk of the enemies yourself. Unfortunately the lumberjack runs quite slowly, hits weakly and reloads his rifle in a period-correct fashion. Combat is a slow and tedious affair with the player's weakness being balanced out by the enemy's reluctance to attack. To top it off, the animations are surprisingly unsatisfying.\n\nCalling the game an epic folktale is a bit disengenuous. The writing is 90s after-school cartoon caliber and the voice acting is pretty wooden. The animations are disappointingly stilted and exacerbate the problem; using static portraits would have been a major improvement. Worst of all, it takes itself way too seriously.\n\nIt's possible that the game gets significantly better after spending enough time on it. Unfortunately, there are plenty of other games that are better right off the bat.","June 21, 2014","false","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Each 'mission' you have a set amount of money to spend on traps... the more efficient you are at not wasting money, the more money you can spend on better gear/upgrades/etc. This creates a sort of minimalist approach.. you're constantly trying to place as little traps as possible, and setting up a perfect wave by wave traps and backup plans that you can fall back on if something doesn't hit. The feeling of satisfaction you get when you pull of a perfectly planned 5+ wave defense is like nothing I've felt before in a game. Even when something goes amiss and you manage to pull through by the skin of your teeth.. it's great. There's enough RPG skill tree mechanics and 3rd person fighting skill to make it a lot more 'alive' then your normal TD game, too. Buy it!

Games like Orcs Must Die and Sanctum seem to lead the pack in this realm but Sang-Froid has emerged to be my favorite of this style of game.  First off, I love the aesthetic of the game.  The frozen Canadian frontier in December during the 1800s really appealed to me.  Couple this with the werewolf and Native American lore and I was hooked.  There is story here.  The voice acting and animation definitely show it's indie roots (meaning not that great) but unlike other games of this ilk, I actually paid attention to the narrative.\n\nGameplay wise, strategy is key.  Know where to place your traps and what kind of traps to use is crucial.  The planning phase of this game ended up being more instrumental to me than any other tower defense game.  It was extremely satisfying during missions to here a trap go off somewhere in the distance and know I had a kill.  The combat might be the weakest part of this game.  You could say it was "challenging" but at times it just seemed clumsy.  I would often swing my ax at an enemy and get caught in a combat animation that would leave me vulnerable.  I don't know if this was intentional but it felt frustrating at times.  However, when it worked, I enjoyed it.\nOverall:\nPros:  Decent story, good atmosphere, great strategy, interesting enemies.\nCons:  Clumsy combat, somewhat stiff voice acting.\n\nI would reccommend this game.  Extra reccommendation: play it in the winter when there is snow on the ground outside  if you can.  This definetly added to my enjoyment of the game.","December 25, 2013","true","14.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At first, my review was positive, but then I changed my mind. Here is why -\n\n\nStory 3/5  -> Original, somewhat engaging, but a bit shallow\n\nGraphics 4/5 -> for an action/tower defence game pretty decent\n\nVoice acting/ cinematics 1/5 -> terrible voice acting, but that is not such a big deal. Cinematics are a nusiance.\n\nGameplay 2/5 -> You want to play. You want to think about the layout of your traps and strategy. But the game will not let you. It is very easy to place the traps, and melee combat is mostly about going near enemy, hitting MB1 (your character will target and hit enemy automatically, even if they are behind you) and sometimes dodging or running away. Shooting would be more fun, but you need to reload every shot which takes way too long for practical purposes and is impossible in melee combat. You can not place traps exactly where you want them, (I am not talking about terrain restriction now), so they happen to be too much to sides for maximizing their potential - and that is just irritating. You also keep XP even from nights you fail, so you are rewarded for failing. It also makes the game less chalenging, which sux.\n\nIn-game mechanics and options 5/5 -> there is everything that fits the atmosphere and nothing more that could disturb or overhype it. It is detailed, but not overdone, they put a lot of time into it and they did a good job. It also works quite well, I only saw one or two minor bugs. + they explain the mechanics very well.\n\nSaves and loads mechanics 0/5 -> Daytime starts by cinematics, after that you tend to plant traps for waves of enemies that come at night. There may be 1-6 waves each night. If you screw up even the last wave, you need to start from daytime again (you can relocate the traps) and go again through all the waves. If, however, you decide to turn the game off, it will start with the beginning cinematics of the day the next time you play it, and your traps will be deleted, so you need to place them again. The game loads extremely slowly for such a small game, but the loading song makes up for it.\n\nFun 3/5 -> This game had great potential. It could have been so much better, perhaps the most complete tower defence / action game hybrid ever made. After a few rounds (when my review was positive) I had great expectations and was looking forward to playing this game. But as I played, it was becoming somehow irritating because of the factors mention above. Still, it was a decent game.\n\nShoul you buy it? No. It is definitely not worth the price.\n\nHowever, If you see it on a sale like -80% or so, then YES, you will not regret it.","December 27, 2014","false","14.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As much as I love a good strategy title, sometimes I want to get right into the action. In this, Sang-Froid: Tales of Werewolves delivers, offering the best blend of action and strategy I've played since Brütal Legend. During the day, players prepare for the night's onslaught by purchasing items, setting traps, and preparing a plan of action. Oh, and I don't use the word "onslaught" lightly. The wolves will attack you relentlessly, and if you lose a single building, it's game over. You'll need to carefully plan ahead and act fast to survive and scrape together a living in this game. It takes the critical thinking of a strategy game and combines it with the frantic action of a brawler. Combine this with the clever "fear" mechanic-wherein you can keep attacks at bay for a short time-and you've got an intense nail-biter of a game.\n\nThe game's pretty rough around the edges. It's certainly not the best looking game, with a somewhat barren and uninteresting landscape. It manages to get away with it for the most part by incorporating a pleasing aesthetic, but it only goes so far. In addition, it's combat is fairly rudimentary, and difficult to enjoy on its own. Bashing wolves with your axe is clunky and not nearly as satisfying as it should be. Though the strategy aspect of the game is top-notch, the action side of things isn't quite as polished.\n\nSang-Froid: Tales of Werewolves combines two genres well enough that I can overlook some of its rougher edges, and enjoy one hell of an intense action strategy experience.","May 5, 2014","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Kill werewolves as a lumberjack in most frightening setting on earth, Canada in Winter.\n\nPicked this up in a humble bundle. Solid game that I lost a few hours into, and a very refreshing take on the action strategy genre.\n\n-You play as either a Canadian lumberjack or hermit trapper, fighting wolves and werewolves.\n-Canadian whisky and beer are you power ups, which is awesome.\n-Game mechanics are solid, and match the games theme, wind affects your scent, shooting and moving make noise, both can cause enemies to target you.\n-Character progression and economy are meaningfull. Seems well balanced so far.\n-Voice acting is a bit rough, I skipped most cutscenes, but it gets points for having a simple but charming art style in game.\n\nIf you like things like orcs must die, or dungeon defenders you'll enjoy this game.","June 22, 2014","true","13.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you can overlook the awful cinematics and lackluster story telling, the game-play is pretty good! A Chapter or "level" consists of 2 phases: daytime strategy planning and night time combat.\n\nDuring the day you can visit shops in town to buy or upgrade equipment, consumables and stat modifying accessories. As well as plan your strategy to survive the coming night by setting up various traps, zip lines and build combat influencing objects like fires or shrines. Each one consumes daylight hours and sometimes money too, so it's a balance to survive as efficiently as possible in order to further fund your plan. I recommend playing on "hard" though.\n\nAt night, you dash around your ever expanding forest territory to defend your friends and their homes from unholy wolf creatures. Combat system is simple and imperfect but still pretty fun. Decently designed skill tree to level through as you gain experience. Also some unique mechanics like wind direction potentially ruining your plan by giving away your scent and the degree to which your enemies fear you needing to be managed.\n\nAlso worth mentioning is the soundtrack, one of it's strongest features. Found myself humming all the music and listening to what I learned was Quebec style folk music that I would have otherwise described as "Celtic."  Certainly worth the few dollars currently being asked during the sale, 15 to 30 hrs of fun strategy & third person action despite simple graphics.","June 20, 2014","true","20.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While story didn't grip me, mechanics easily carry the game. It's a mix of tactical trap-based defense and real time 3rd person cmbat.  By day you set up your traps, by night you run around while the waves spawn activating certain traps, luring monsters, simply fighting or panicking because something didn't go as planned and now you have an angry werewolf on your heels.\n\nEven real time combat requires planing and tactics. You have to manage your stamina, musket amunition and reload (it's 19 century) utilise fear through fire and  well timed attacks. Intimidated enemies give you some time to aim, reload or catch breath because getting caught in a pack of even basic wolves will hurt.\n\nThe game offers huge amounts of gameplay variation - multiple traps, trap combinations, extensive skill tree to customise your playstyle. Clear waves without moving from your front porch? Funnel enemies around 1 big exploding barrel? Drop bait to keep them occupied until you and your new silver axe can catch up? Snipe from watchtower perch? Mix and match.\n\nMechanics are robust, soundtrack's nice, didn't notice any glitches or bugs (wave spawning notwhistanding).\nI highly recommend this game for unique mix of mechanics.

I did not expect to fall in love with this game as much as I did. You play one of the two feuding brothers who have to work together to protect their sister from the Devil. The story takes place in a snowy village in Canada during the 19th Century.\n\nThe game has a great balance between action and strategy.  During the day you can go to town, buy a better musket and/or axe to fight the werewolves with.  There are also health, stamina, increase damage potions and a lot more.  You can head to the convent to have one of the nuns bless your axe or bullets which increases your damage to the werewolves but this will eat into some of your money.  You can use the rest of your money to then buy traps and set up how you are going to defeat the waves of werewolves that come in the night.  Anything that gets passed your trap you will have to shoot or strike with an axe.\n\nAt first you just start by protecting the house your sister is resting in but the game eventually adds four more buildings that you have to protect, adding more of a challenge.  In addition, the game eventually adds a smell factor into your planning.  Your scent is carried by the wind, which changes direction everyday.  Your scent can either ruin or better your strategy depending on how you use it.  The game adds another mechanic that is called Fear Factor.  With this you are able to intimidate the wolves and be able to handle multiple wolves at a time.  In the beginning it's not that complicated and there is not much planning you have to do but as the story progresses the more time you spend planning out your strategy.\n\nA feature I liked about the game is that if something doesn't go right during the night and wolves start to overwhelm you, you can go back and make minor tweaks to your strategy and try new things out.  Towards the end there are a couple of days that are tough and you will have to do some trial and error strategy’s but I really enjoyed that part as well.\n\nAt the start of the game you choose which brother you would like to use.  You are given a basic musket and a basic axe.  You can upgrade them using your money and also improve it's skills with a skill tree.  As you gain EXP (by killing wolves) you will gain levels and get a skill point for every level you earn.  You can then spend that skill point into a skill tree to improve your gun, axe, health, stamina, fear factor, or traps.\n\nThe music in the game is really strange but in a good way.  It's very catchy and I enjoyed it as it went well with the time and theme of the game.\n\nThe voice acting is... not the best... unfortunately.  I think it could have been quite a lot better.  The voice acting isn't a deal breaker for me though, I can get passed it and just listen to the story and enjoy the gameplay.\n\nBad voice acting aside, the game is wonderful and I can't wait for Tome II to come out.  I really enjoyed it, the story is good, the combat is fun and planning out your night I found to be the funnest part.  I will be replaying it again as the other brother.","March 12, 2014","true","13.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

From the trailer, it looked like a great hack and slash with tactical planning, but ended up having Rainbow Six bloopers where if you don't do everything perfectly, you are screwed.\n\nThe graphics are pretty good. They remind me of a  launch title for the PS2. I don't like how little I can adjust the graphics and because of the lowest settings available, it isn't fluid for frame rates (I hover around 40 instead of the preferred 60). I can't even adjust the resolution outside of my monitor (16:10), so I'm forced to 1244x800 instead of picking something lower when there are options to select lower.\n\nThe reaction times for attack animations are a bit off. The stamina bar affects attack speed, but creatures like the werewolf tended to almost blink towards me like a flash step and I couldn't swing to counter attack in time. Things like that prevent  a lot tactical fighting, especially when certain creatures like the Were-wolf are too fast to run away from and you'll pretty much die if you don't strike first with a trap.\n\nSound effects are passable. I wanted to listen to my own music fairly quickly, but the intro song alone was pretty good while it took two full minutes to load on a fairly modern machine. (made in 2011 with the latest parts at the time).\n\nAll together it is frustrating to the point I don't want to spend too much time replaying levels because of the inability for the characters to be useful. It is Rainbow Six all over again and the old Rainbox Six games were cool atmosphere but quit-inducing rage sessions due to bad AI and weird decisions from the Devs for gameplay, just like this game.","March 13, 2014","false","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is very creative and also innovative for games in general; adding interesting mechanics and ideas that are difficult to find in any other game!\nSimple things like having enemies able to fear you, smell you and hear you, make this game stand out from anything else you could find.\n\nWhat I like:\n- Great progression - The game is constantly adding new mechanics, enemies, traps and weapons, so it never becomes stale.\n- Planning - Allowing you to set up traps and decide what to defend during the day, and setting the plan in motion at night is a brilliant idea, and feels so rewarding when you accomplish the level.\n- The Lore - I usually don't pay attention to the setting of the games world, but Sang-Forid makes me care about the folk history, the overall aesthetic to the game is really amazing.\n- The Music - The music appeals to me in EVERY ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ WAY POSSIBLE, simply fantastic. It is also very fitting for the world it is set in!\n\nWhat I dislike/ could have been improved:\n- The story/ Dialogue - I am interested in the story, but due to the fact it was made by french developers the translation from French to English can sometimes come off poor or cheesy, not all the dialogue is bad though and most of the voice actors are actually quite good. It is sadly just not as strong as the rest of the game, but the fact that the developers were able to pull it off in the first place is a positive in my opinion!\n\nIf you haven't guessed it already, I adore this game and would recommend it to anyone and everyone!","January 20, 2014","true","9.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

As much as I love a good strategy title, sometimes I want to get right into the action. In this, Sang-Froid: Tales of Werewolves delivers, offering the best blend of action and strategy I've played since Brütal Legend. During the day, players prepare for the night's onslaught by purchasing items, setting traps, and preparing a plan of action. Oh, and I don't use the word "onslaught" lightly. The wolves will attack you relentlessly, and if you lose a single building, it's game over. You'll need to carefully plan ahead and act fast to survive and scrape together a living in this game. It takes the critical thinking of a strategy game and combines it with the frantic action of a brawler. Combine this with the clever "fear" mechanic-wherein you can keep attacks at bay for a short time-and you've got an intense nail-biter of a game.\n\nThe game's pretty rough around the edges. It's certainly not the best looking game, with a somewhat barren and uninteresting landscape. It manages to get away with it for the most part by incorporating a pleasing aesthetic, but it only goes so far. In addition, it's combat is fairly rudimentary, and difficult to enjoy on its own. Bashing wolves with your axe is clunky and not nearly as satisfying as it should be. Though the strategy aspect of the game is top-notch, the action side of things isn't quite as polished.\n\nSang-Froid: Tales of Werewolves combines two genres well enough that I can overlook some of its rougher edges, and enjoy one hell of an intense action strategy experience.","May 5, 2014","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not even because it looked good or bad, but just because I never bothered to look much into it, despite the fact that it has a big manly lumberjack on its main Steam picture (lumberjacks are awesome!).\n\nIn terms of graphics, I'll admit the game doesn't look that amazing, but that's understandable considering this is the studio's first game and the game's price. However, the atmosphere that's presented completely balances this off, by making you forget about the simple and sometimes clunky models with its pure Canadian charm. I'm Canadian, I live in Quebec, I love snow, I love the night, and I can absolutely guarantee that this game feels very authentic. This mood is even backed up by Canadian folk music.\n\nEven the story feels very Canadian, using myths and legends that are very historical, which also includes native folklore. At some points I'd play the game and think to myself "this reminds me of that one folk tale I read in high school..."\n\nWhile the voice acting is somewhat bland, I was pleasantly surprised when I tried playing the game in french. Except for one character, I feel there's a lot more emotion put into the dialogue, and the characters even speak with the regional accent!\n\nAs for the gameplay, it's really unique and thoughtful. Not only are you up against creatures much stronger than your character, you have a limited amount of ways to survive each night. The planning feels very difficult, but if you do it right, it will really pay off. The combat is also very strategic, since you use an old timey musket (5 or so second reload time), and your stamina rarely allows you to get more than a few hits off at once. Luckily, there's a fear mechanic for the enemies, which you can manipulate to help you survive a bit longer.\n\nOverall, I'd definitely recommend this game! Especially for the price!","August 3, 2014","true","30.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I grew up in minnesota, so when I saw werewolves, and canadian foklore, and RTS AND action...I hit the purchase button faster than a Wendigo sneezes ice. It has a great folky soundtrack, and great hand-drawn visuals, especially the menu and town interfaces.\n\nBeing that it is indeed an indie game, the game budgets and amount of people working on this  title would be laughable to a mega-corp like Ubisoft or the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly EA. So there are a few expected rough areas, but they don't detract from the overall game. Mainly, the voice acting was terrible, I felt like random people off the street were pulled in to read children’s books to 1rst graders. If they every make a TOME II, it would be great if they addressed this. Conversely, the sounds while playing the game and the music are very well done. It really sends a shiver up your spine playing this in your room at night, the sounds of the wind rushing through trees, the crack of branches and snarls and howls of the beasts just over the hill expertly done to always create the feeling you will be attacked at any moment.\n\nMechanically the game works pretty smooth, and is challenging to say the least. It creates tense and relentless action when you hit the go button; it actually is scary in a way. There is a sense of dread and nervousness as you hover your mouse over the ‘begin’ button…setting in motion the nights terrors upon you.  You hope things will work out and you will survive, but it always feels as if the odds are stacked against you. My one complaint is the pacing...the skill tree becoming unlocked only started to open up toward the end, and by the time I could really afford some better weapons, there were only a couple missions left. I wish there was a patch to adjust this a bit. I love a challenge, but I hate seeing cool things that I can't afford and can't have fun using, then it’s over. When it was over though, I can say it was definitely a sense of accomplishment! This makes me want to go back now, play with the harder brother and see if I can get those last few achievements, which are not just filler achievements.\n\nOverall, for a couple bucks, this game is well worth it, is unique, and hope to see their next game...though it looks vastly different in theme. A great 'first' game for this small team in Canada!\n","November 28, 2014","true","22.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sang Froid: Tales of Werewolves is Montreal-based Artifice Studio's first title, and in spite of some general shabbiness in its presentation, they've done enough things right here that I'll be keeping an eye out for their future releases.\n\nIn Sang Froid, you play a pair of Canadian woodsman brothers, defending their sister (as well as the surrounding community) from nightly assaults by supernatural forces both Christian and Pagan in nature. Gameplay takes the form of an innovative and wonderfully executed combination of chop-em-up action, clever tower defense, and Rainbow Six-style tactical planning. Each day presents you with a chunk of storyline, and then lets you spend your limited daylight hours setting up traps on your property or logging at the local lumber yard for extra cash (which is spent on weapons, items, and some of the more dramatic and powerful trap-types). Thanks to your psychic sister, you know ahead of time what kinds of enemies will be attacking, where they'll come from, and what they intend to destroy; setting appropriate traps for each situation is crucial to survival, as you can only be in one place at a time, and your combat prowess is hardly a match for a single werewolf, let alone a pack of several.\n\nWhen night falls, the assault begins and you get to see if your defenses hold up. Armed with an axe, a rifle, and whatever consumables you've brought with you, you must do everything in your power to wipe out the assaulting units. At its simplest, you can engage opponents in melee, killing off opponents that you either hadn't set traps for or which manage to survive whatever you'd prepared. While the controls are a little wobbly at times, the combat options are innovative, simple, and very intelligent. When you aren't out busting skulls, however, your job will be to run from trap to trap, activating them at the right time to deal the most damage, or letting the enemy catch your scent and then luring them to their fiery/spiky/bouldery doom. Several enemies are very resilient to your weapon attacks, and without intelligent use of traps they can be nearly unbeatable in hand-to-hand combat. You can get around this by wielding blessed or silver weaponry, but you can only carry one axe at a time, and you can't have it both ways.\n\nI haven't had this much fun with a game in a long, long time. All the trap varieties are useful in their own way, adding interesting layers to the strategy. Plotting out the most effective and efficient layout to take out enemies is a bit intimidating at first, but quickly becomes very satisfying; there's nothing quite like knowing you've set up a fool-proof murder gauntlet and then seeing it work like a charm. Running through the woods, sneaking up on your prey as it munches on the bait you've left out; or ziplining over the forest to engage a band of demons at precisely the right moment... Each night's encounter is demanding enough to make you work for it, and all the elements involved in pulling it off are simply fun. Based purely on the gameplay, Sang Froid is an easy title to recommend.\n\nIt does have a few weaknesses though. The game suffers beneath an occasionally stuttery framerate, no-budget cutscenes, fairly basic character models, a script that's difficult to take seriously, and a voice acting cast made up of amateurs (several of whom likely have English as a second language). This is more than counterbalanced by a gorgeous musical score, an unorthodox and inventive setting that drowns out the actual writing, and the stellar gameply mentioned above. If it weren't for the fact that nobody seems to know it exists, I'd say Sang Froid has all the makings of a truly great cult classic.","July 1, 2014","true","11.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I went into it thinking that it would be like Orcs Must Die but with werewolves, which sounded like a pretty awesome premise; instead, it turned out to be a clunky, dull action game with strategy and RPG overtones.\n\nThe worst part of the game for me is the interface. The font used was definitely picked for style rather than legibility, making it tricky to get a quick read on your ammo count. The health bar is a strange, bifurcated heart which again is not helpful for at-a-glance info. You wield two weapons, but instead of using a toggle, weapon selection is modal. You have to hold down a key to keep the rifle out. Reloading the rifle is boosted by button mashing which is an egregiously stupid mechanic. The whole town's worth of shops could have been condensed into a single screen. The fear factor UI is painfully unintuitive but works decently once explained. I think even the developers realised how bad the UI is because the tutorial is filled with videos describing in elaborate detail how everything works. When you've gotten to that step, you need to seriously rethink your design decisions.\n\nThe gameplay is where things really fell apart. It seems like most traps are one-use-only which kills the tower defence feeling for me. Because you can't rely on traps, you need to dispatch a good chunk of the enemies yourself. Unfortunately the lumberjack runs quite slowly, hits weakly and reloads his rifle in a period-correct fashion. Combat is a slow and tedious affair with the player's weakness being balanced out by the enemy's reluctance to attack. To top it off, the animations are surprisingly unsatisfying.\n\nCalling the game an epic folktale is a bit disengenuous. The writing is 90s after-school cartoon caliber and the voice acting is pretty wooden. The animations are disappointingly stilted and exacerbate the problem; using static portraits would have been a major improvement. Worst of all, it takes itself way too seriously.\n\nIt's possible that the game gets significantly better after spending enough time on it. Unfortunately, there are plenty of other games that are better right off the bat.","June 21, 2014","false","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The premise looked interesting, but I wasn't sure how well it would work. After playing the game though, I cannot recommend the game enough. Having to tactically place and manage traps was surprisingly engaging. Fine tuning a trap layout after a failed night was rewarding. The melee combat isn't perfect, and it was designed to be that way. Enemies are threatening in combat, which means you have to balance your stamina, your attacks, and your fear level. It all boils down to an absolute gem, with an charming aesthetic, and an absolutely lovely soundtrack.","October 12, 2014","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, no promises can be made.\n\n***Possible Spoilers follow***\n\nAn amazing game for the price.  It is definitely unique, albeit a tad bit easy.  I started the game with Jos, although I really wanted Jack because I was hoping for more gunplay.  Changed to Jack after day 3 because it seemed a bit too easy to NOT play on the mode I had originally wanted.\n\nAlthough I found the gunplay severely lacking, I still enjoyed the game.  Honestly, aside from shooting Net traps or occasionally shooting enemies as they ran up, I rarely used my gun at all.  Even sitting on bonfires, I found it more advantageous to run out, do a full combo once or twice, and then run back into the saftey zone of the warming flames.\n\nHowever, when you think about it, that merges great with the historical and realistic (for a game about demons and werewolves) feel that the developers were trying to create. It wouldn't make much sense for you to be running around with a musket firing off round after round during the time period the game takes place in.\n\nI wasn't entirely thrilled by everything in the game though.  I spent a lot of the nights just sitting around waiting on my traps to go off and still using a good chunk of my AP on cutting lumber for money.  I actually found myself purposefully letting enemies get to my buildings each wave so I would have something to do.  If you understand how the traps work, you could literally clear almost every wave with traps alone.\n\nOverall the combat system itself was poorly made.  You get your "autoattack" consisting of left clicking up to 3 times for a combo (and with your stamina thats about 6-8 clicks until you fatigue) or rightclicking to spend your "rage" points. Once you learn the system its pretty childish.  Left click combo (3 clicks) to knock an enemy down, run / sprint in circles (run around and only sprint when they get close to avoid attack), and then combo again and repeat. Throw in an occasional Right-Click for a stamina-free attack/knockdown here and there. Doing this you could take on Wendigos and The Invisible Beast no problem. After around days 3-5 I never found myself using the roll (spacebar) except during fights with the "Fireflies". There was just no point in wasting all that stamina when a quick sprint away would dodge most if not all attacks and leave you with a lot more stamina.\n\nThe "Fireflies" were probably the most annoying thing in the game.  Before you get the hang of fighting them, you will find youself constanly trying to take one down, only to find yourself slammed in the back by a fireball from another one and knocked down while the one you were fighting disappears underground to heal himself back up to full.  And thanks to the aforementioned combat system, you were really limited on your choices in fighting them with your axe.  Even once you learn how to fight them, you will still find yourself catching the occasional fireball and cursing at them.\n\n**Small spoilers**\n\nWhich doesn't even matter towards the last few days of the game.  A very unique factor in the game was that enemies only took full damage from certain types of weapons (Normal, Blessed/Holy, or Silver).  So you had to decide what type of axe you wanted to bring with you or your types of bullets to stock up on (although as before, the gun is pretty useless unless you REALLY want to shoot something).  And then they add in THE AXE. Anyone who has played the game that far knows what I'm talking about, and others will know when they get there.\n\nThis axe does full damage to everything. EVERYTHING. So now nothing is resistant anymore.  They basically took their system and threw it out the window for the last few days of the game, making the game even easier when it was supposed to be getting harder.  After you get the axe any combat is cake.  Wendigo? No problem (although a ballista will take it out in 1 shot with the skill point). I wouldn't recommend fighting a Wendigo hand-to-hand (because they cannot be knocked down, only backwards), but it is still pretty easy. And the Fireflies become cake. 15 Health? Kinda annoying to fight when they're resistant and can heal.  After the axe they go down in about 4 or 5 swings.\n\n**End Small Spoilers**\n\nA lot of the traps become obsolete later on as well. The wolf trap (20 AP and some money) is all well and good early on for insta-killing 1 wolf. Later on when the wolves come in packs of 3 there is little point to it. I put 1 point in trapping just so it would hold things (mainly Maikkans) for 10 seconds so I could set a spike trap and wait for more enemies to run up on the one stuck in place. Spike traps were better for the wolves because at 55 AP they save you AP and you can set them on the spawn point to drop the packs as soon as they zone in. The hanging nets become pretty much useless unless you want to use it on fireflies, and even then since it spreads the damage around between the enemies underneath you have to run up and finish them off.  I found that setting a Cross under a net, shouting, activating cross when they got near, letting it do some damage, and then dropping the trap was the best way for clearing a group of fireflies with minimum effort. And bonfires were pretty much useless because, as I mentioned earlier, you could get through almost every wave in the game without really having to fight anything if you set your traps right.\n\n**Small Ending Spoiler**\n\nAnd the ending itself was just, bleh.  There was no real feeling that you had finished the game.  It just ends like any other day in the game. There was no big feeling of triumph after you had finished it. It ends on a definite cliffhanger, but for the time put into the game the ending just isnt there. You get like 30 seconds of cutscene or so like you would any other day of the game.  You don't even reunite with the brother whose soul you saved. Everything was building up to you defeating this super demon and saving the village, you defeat it, and then thats it. A small cutscene, and its over.  Nothing about saving the village, saving your sister, saving your brother, nothing. It just ends, and rather poorly at that.  I even found myself googling the ending afterwards to see if I had missed something.\n\n**End Ending Spoiler**\n\nBut all of that aside, there was something about the game that compelled me to finish it.  It could have been the gamer in me that didn't want to leave a game I had bought unbeaten. It could have been the uniqueness of the game itself.  But everything aside, I did find the game very enjoyable for the price and would recommend people to pick it up. Some people may want to wait to pick it up on sale (I got mine on sale) because although $15 for the game isnt a bad price at all, the game DOES lack a certain polish that would make it a must-have. I would definitely recommend that it at least gets placed on your wish list and for you to pick it up at some point, because it is definitely a unique and intriguing game even with the flaws in the game itself.\n\nI would like to see a sequel made, but the developers are really going to need to flesh it out a lot more to make it worthwhile, and the story is going to need to have some major work put into it. It felt like it was just a side thought to the game to spice it up a little bit in between the repititive nightly routine the game falls in to.","February 1, 2014","true","14.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Each 'mission' you have a set amount of money to spend on traps... the more efficient you are at not wasting money, the more money you can spend on better gear/upgrades/etc. This creates a sort of minimalist approach.. you're constantly trying to place as little traps as possible, and setting up a perfect wave by wave traps and backup plans that you can fall back on if something doesn't hit. The feeling of satisfaction you get when you pull of a perfectly planned 5+ wave defense is like nothing I've felt before in a game. Even when something goes amiss and you manage to pull through by the skin of your teeth.. it's great. There's enough RPG skill tree mechanics and 3rd person fighting skill to make it a lot more 'alive' then your normal TD game, too. Buy it!

Games like Orcs Must Die and Sanctum seem to lead the pack in this realm but Sang-Froid has emerged to be my favorite of this style of game.  First off, I love the aesthetic of the game.  The frozen Canadian frontier in December during the 1800s really appealed to me.  Couple this with the werewolf and Native American lore and I was hooked.  There is story here.  The voice acting and animation definitely show it's indie roots (meaning not that great) but unlike other games of this ilk, I actually paid attention to the narrative.\n\nGameplay wise, strategy is key.  Know where to place your traps and what kind of traps to use is crucial.  The planning phase of this game ended up being more instrumental to me than any other tower defense game.  It was extremely satisfying during missions to here a trap go off somewhere in the distance and know I had a kill.  The combat might be the weakest part of this game.  You could say it was "challenging" but at times it just seemed clumsy.  I would often swing my ax at an enemy and get caught in a combat animation that would leave me vulnerable.  I don't know if this was intentional but it felt frustrating at times.  However, when it worked, I enjoyed it.\nOverall:\nPros:  Decent story, good atmosphere, great strategy, interesting enemies.\nCons:  Clumsy combat, somewhat stiff voice acting.\n\nI would reccommend this game.  Extra reccommendation: play it in the winter when there is snow on the ground outside  if you can.  This definetly added to my enjoyment of the game.","December 25, 2013","true","14.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Some people may want to wait to pick it up on sale (I got mine on sale) because although $15 for the game isnt a bad price at all, the game DOES lack a certain polish that would make it a must-have. I would definitely recommend that it at least gets placed on your wish list and for you to pick it up at some point, because it is definitely a unique and intriguing game even with the flaws in the game itself.\n\nI would like to see a sequel made, but the developers are really going to need to flesh it out a lot more to make it worthwhile, and the story is going to need to have some major work put into it. It felt like it was just a side thought to the game to spice it up a little bit in between the repititive nightly routine the game falls in to.","February 1, 2014","true","14.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/avwolf/recommended/227220/","avwolf","AvWolf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/avwolf/","331 products in account","Note that this review is based on just a few hours of play; I haven't completed the game yet.\n\nLet me get this out of the way first: The cutscenes, both cinematic and in-engine, are pretty terrible and the story isn't anything to write home about.  The animation doesn't look especially good, the voice acting is sometimes questionable (on top of that, they don't pronounce things right for French Canadians which hurts my suspension of disbelief), and the writing occasionally veers into downright cringe-worthy.  I still appreciate that the cutscenes are there, since they do at least tie the missions/nights together, but I don't really enjoy them, per se.\n\nSang-Froid is sort of a combination 3rd-person action game and tower defense strategy, and fortunately, it pulls the gameplay off reasonably well.  The strategic and tactical elements of planning out your traps and then trying to execute your plan is quite satisfying.  The game has a surprising amount of little intricate details, like how your enemies can track you via sound and scent, and how you can use an intimidation system to buy yourself some breathing room, which come together with a variety of traps, many of which require some manual management on your part, to make a game that you can actually sometimes feel cunning during.  In a testament to the developers' enemy design, the monsters actually feel fairly varied, even though their variety is in reality little more than rock-paper-scissors, and they kind of fall to the same axework.\n\nThe game is at its strongest when you're planning your traps out, or rushing across the map to trip a net full of rocks just in the nick onf time.  You really get caught up in the moment, watching your plans come to fruition, or hearing the distant sound of a spike trap impaling a bunch of wolves while you're in the middle of a fight.\n\nUnfortunately, the combat system doesn't measure up to the traps.  The ranged combat system has a far too aggressive auto-aim.  It's useful when you're trying to line up shots on circling wolves, as the rifle is meant to fire too slowly to make manual aiming feel rewarding.  But when you're trying to trigger one out of several clustered traps of nets filled with rocks, the game's inability to know which one you actually wanted to shoot as their autoaim fights each other can completely ruin a trap.  Not being able to move while reloading is frustraing, but I understand and accept the developer's decision in that regard, as it does make shooting the rifle "mean" more -- it makes using the weapon a resource beyond just the ammunition it takes, as the reload time can be a serious liability in the middle of a wave of enemies.\n\nThe melee combat system feels clunky and vague.  It's more like Don't Starve than Arkham Asylum or Assassin's Creed.  While hitting enemies with your axe is rewarding, the enemy "tells" for attacks are generally not obvious enough to make the dodge system really pay off.  You'll hit a werewolf twice, then suddenly get knocked over when they attack back, seemingly without warning.  You also have little control over what you're doing beyond "swing axe," so sometimes you'll knock enemies away when you'd rather be pressing the attack.  I find myself perpetually short of stamina, which probably means I'm fighting wrong, but it still is frustrating.   The real problem though is that while the enemies behave differently in terms of traps, in combat, they all seem to fight pretty much the same; or at least your tactics for fighting are pretty much the same.  All that changes is which weapon the enemy is particularly vulnerable to, which doesn't make for especially satisfying combat.  (Then again, I get the feeling that melee combat is *supposed* to be somewhat discouraged in the game, and almost making it dull does sort of discourage it.)\n\nEach night is pretty short, but can be reasonably intense as the timing of some of your traps can be quite tight.  This gives each mission an almost bite-sized quality, so it's easy to play a couple nights in spite of a busy schedule.  It also lends itself to the "just one more" phenomenon in a way that longer missions would not.\n\nSang-Froid has its rough spots, but I feel that the game realizes the goals it set out to achieve, and by keeping itself short and sweet it manages to emphasize its fun parts and keeps the less fun parts from becoming tedious.","January 27, 2014","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Personally, I feel like that's ever-so-slightly high -- I would've purchased this game at some point before it went on sale, if the full price was closer to $9.99.

The action part is cartoonish but still very enjoyable to look at and in 3D.  If you are looking for 'Crysis' graphics, look elsewhere.  It's much more art oriented.  The music is taken from canadian folklore and is quite nice to listen to.  As for the sounds (explosions, beasts roars, axe hits, guns firing,.) they are well executed and add tangibility to the game.\n\nGameplay\n\nAs mentioned above, this is a mixed game, whereas you play a tower defense game at first and after that you put your plan to execution in a 3rd view action game.  In the strategy part you are presented with a comprehensive map that tells you which creature you are going to fight, their number and their headings, i e where they will attack.  It is there that you have to put up traps to stop them from attacking buildings and thus destroying them or else you fail the scenario.  You have complete control on which traps to use, and where to use them (as long as they are unlocked from progressing in the game).  You are only limited by the in-game mechanics, i e money and action points.\n\nThe second part is as said putting your plan into execution, and this is done by pressing the 'Start the night' button in the map view.  You then have control of a lumberjack armed with an axe an a rifle and equipped with potions.  This part is rendered in 3D with a 3rd perspective aspect.  The controls are responsive and the animations are well done.  You can view in real time your traps, set them off if needed to and coming to life.  In all my gameplay, i have encountered one bug related to a specific trap, the spike trap.  Sometimes even if i was standing outside the spikes, they would hit me anyways and kill me with the other beasts standing on it.  Othe than that the gameplay is fun and sometimes even scary!\n\nConclusion\n\nFor a 6 member studio, this game is remarkably well done.  I encountered no bugs and everything worked as described.  Depending how much time you wanna spend in the strategy map, this game should take between 10 to 20 hours to complete.  The game is not without cons, and personally i have 2.  First one is regarding the resolution.  Maybe the Devs will patch this up but for now the highest resolution is 1080P.  Second con, if they would also patch the icons in the 3D view which are not big enough with higher resolutions.  Other than that i highly recommand this game.\n\n","January 31, 2014","true","15.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The strategic and action combines perferctly. The more strategic in the traps you are, the less effort need to be done in combat, but traps cost money and time to build, what really makes you need to be strategic decisions about what traps you will put to balance with the difficulty of the combat, so you can save money for new weapons and accesories.\n\nIt also have an leveling system to help you, but that was a little weak, you only gain a skill point when evolve, nothing more, so you don't get stronger for later in the game, also there is no way to get more exp then beating the stages, so basicaly after each stage you gain a skill point to spend in the skill tree.\n\nEven if this is a lower point, it doesn't mess the fun in the game at all. The game is at the right size, 20 stages, and have two difficulties (which is the brother you choose to play), so when you beat the game in normal dificulty, you will end up going for the hard to get all the achivements. Achivements are not impossible to get, as so many games are, what makes it fun to get the 100%. Anyway, the game is great, I recommend.

It is also very fitting for the world it is set in!\n\nWhat I dislike/ could have been improved:\n- The story/ Dialogue - I am interested in the story, but due to the fact it was made by french developers the translation from French to English can sometimes come off poor or cheesy, not all the dialogue is bad though and most of the voice actors are actually quite good. It is sadly just not as strong as the rest of the game, but the fact that the developers were able to pull it off in the first place is a positive in my opinion!\n\nIf you haven't guessed it already, I adore this game and would recommend it to anyone and everyone!","January 20, 2014","true","9.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

The levels play as both a tower defense puzzle where you place elaborate traps around the map in order to take enemies out passively, and as an RPG with strategy components where you engage the enemies actively with rifle and axe. The fear meter is a very interesting mechanic where the actions of the enemy depend on the amount of fear both you and your enemies have.

The gameplay is enjoyable. Overall, I like the story.\nI think a level editor would be nice (editing what enemies spawn where to create custom challenges).\nThe loading time to start the game is fairly long for me, but once it's loaded, things move fairly smoothly.\nI got the game at a discount and have found it to be worth it.\n\nThe idea of a "fear factor" is a nice idea, but I feel there aren't enough things that influence it. It's often a case of the enemies being afraid of you most of the time, or never being afraid of you (at least until the final levels). There's no way to scare any of the wolves into temporarily running away or scattering, for instance - the most you can do is light a fire, causing most enemies to stay back for a minute.\n\nNonetheless, the game presents a good challenge with a variety of ways to solve any one level (in addition to one's playthrough strategy -- does one focus on trap upgrades, or character health?)\n\nI disagree with calling this game a "tower defense" - the traps/buildings you can construct are generally reset each day, and you need to operate most of them manually. It makes it very important to plan out how you will tackle each enemy from each wave. If they didn't tell you where the enemies were coming from, exactly what path they're following, and exactly how many there are, the game would be very different (and possibly better, though it would require a major redesign of how the traps work/how expensive they are). The major downside to the current system is that it seems less like strategy and more like "Which is the cheapest trap [or trap combination] that I can use to kill these enemies?"","August 1, 2014","true","26.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Thankfully, it plays like an 8th grade level.\n\nOVERALL - 3.5 / 10\n\nPROS\n+ combat feels responsive\n+ music is good\n+ planning each level is interesting\n+ relatively bug free (unless you're trying to get achievements, in which case the opposite of that)\n\nCONS\n- awful models (texturing is ok at best)\n- awful voice acting\n- awful writing\n- way too many game mechanics overly complicates almost every portion of the game\n- replaying levels *intentionally* disincentivized\n- every level uses the same map for the entire game\n\nDETAILS\nWhere to even begin with this one. I really wanted to like Sang-Froid, I really did. Overall I like the concept of an action-RPG + tower defense game (Orcs Must Die! does it fairly well), and the movement in the game doesn't play all that poorly, but overall it is extremely poorly executed.\n\nProbably my biggest gripe is that combat-related gameplay itself is just a pile-on of systems that's only purposes seem to be to limit what the player can do. First there is stamina, which is a combined limit of being able to run as well as your ability to use melee combat. Melee is frustratingly bad, especially the targeting. Often times you'll be attacking an enemy that's about to die and then suddenly the game will switch targets on you and you'll be swinging at something else on the other side of the screen, leaving that low health enemy free to do whatever it wants (which 90% of the time means regen to full or cast a meteor swarm down on your face). It becomes even MORE frustrating when enemies start becoming ~90% resistant to normal damage, so unless you have a weapon the enemy is weak to you won't be doing full damage. Ranged combat requires you to reload after every single shot you take, which takes an inordinate amount of time (there's an *achievement* for reloading in under 3 seconds). You can speed up reloading slightly by mashing a button, which seems to only distract the player from how long it actually takes. Also of note for ranged combat is that it has headshot and non-headshot hitboxes that "lock on" (poorly) that are infuriating more often than not. Next, there's a "fear" system that was supposed to help players not fight enemies all the time, but in practice way too complicated and cumbersome. On top of all of this there are still traps for players to place, each of which only has *one* use per level (seriously?) per trap placed.\n\nPaired with this combat system is ~ 3 different enemies (there's one ranged enemy in the game, and then a few minor variations of a melee enemy) and *one* map that goes through extremely minor changes and expands slightly between levels. Also of note are the "two" characters to choose from, which in reality only vary in starting stats so I'm still not sure why the choice even exists. If there had been half as much time / effort put in to adding all the limiting factors in combat and 4x as much time put into adding real variations in content, it would have potentially been a much more engaging game. Unfortunately, while it seems all of the development efforts were spent in adding combat systems, combat gets old very quickly without a change in enemies to face. The different starting points and number of enemies each wave helps masks this problem slightly, but that wears thin pretty quickly.\n\nOn top of all of this, replaying levels is almost completely out of the question. You CAN go back to a level you've already completed, however it erases ALL progress past that point. There is one achievement for completing the game for each character, but why anyone would do that is beyond me. The game doesn't play differently for either character, save for the fact that one of them has less health AND stamina than the other. Skill points that are awarded each time a player levels up only seem to annoy a player more than help them, most of which only add minor amounts of damage. The skill points spent almost never make a difference in whether or not an enemy dies; either the damage added is already overkill, or it adds such a minimal amount that you're better off walking up and meleeing them instead.\n\nEasily the worst parts of the game are the "animated cutscenes" between levels. I could forgive the awful models if there were a lot of them (or if this game was made in 2006), but there are comically few to be seen and it was released in 2013. It is very apparent that the entirety of the modeling / animation efforts in the game were spent on the cutscenes, which there are unfortunately ~1-3 of every single level. The voice acting is as cringe-worthy as the models, and the writing is almost as bad. Given that the story is based on French Canadian folklore, however, that means 90% of the work was already done story-wise, so how that was screwed up so poorly I'll never know.\n\nOverall, this game has a lot of things in place to distract players from the fact that just about every system was poorly planned and designed, so if you're really into shiny things feel free to pick it up. If you're not easily fooled, however, stay as far away as you can.","January 15, 2015","false","15.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But there are a few differences that set it apart from Orcs Must Die!.\n\nFirst difference is that there is more or less one map. But that map grows and evolves as one progress through the campaign. Rivers freezing over or a section of forest being cleared opens up new paths for enemies to attack your buildings, but it also means more ways to delay those enemies and  more fronts to ambush them as well.\n\nSecond, trap placement emphasizes location and combination over sheer quantity. One can only place traps at dawn and cannot be moved once the night begins. This means one must take the time to consider enemy paths (and later on, wind direction), when placing traps so that one may effectively deal with each wave of enemies. In addition, traps often work best when used in combination with other traps. While an explosive barrel may take out many enemies that just happen to pass by, bait can placed near the barrel so that enemies bunch up in a small area, thus greatly increasing the kill count.\n\nFinally, fighting feels more intense and personal. There are relatively few enemies per level, but that only means each one of them poses more of threat. Melee attacks share the same Stamina resource used for sprinting and rolling, so one can only chain up a limited number of attacks before leaving one open for a counter attack. Ranged weapons are reflective of the time period, so each shot must be used effectively as the weapon only hold one bullet and takes several seconds to reload. But thankfully one can intimidate enemies so that they hesitate to attack, thus buying precious time to replenish stamina and to reload.\n\nOverall, I recommend this game to anyone who is looking for game that test one's planning skills as well as anyone who is looking to experience a new setting in videogames.","July 19, 2013","true","47.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sang Froid: Tales of Werewolves is Montreal-based Artifice Studio's first title, and in spite of some general shabbiness in its presentation, they've done enough things right here that I'll be keeping an eye out for their future releases.\n\nIn Sang Froid, you play a pair of Canadian woodsman brothers, defending their sister (as well as the surrounding community) from nightly assaults by supernatural forces both Christian and Pagan in nature. Gameplay takes the form of an innovative and wonderfully executed combination of chop-em-up action, clever tower defense, and Rainbow Six-style tactical planning. Each day presents you with a chunk of storyline, and then lets you spend your limited daylight hours setting up traps on your property or logging at the local lumber yard for extra cash (which is spent on weapons, items, and some of the more dramatic and powerful trap-types). Thanks to your psychic sister, you know ahead of time what kinds of enemies will be attacking, where they'll come from, and what they intend to destroy; setting appropriate traps for each situation is crucial to survival, as you can only be in one place at a time, and your combat prowess is hardly a match for a single werewolf, let alone a pack of several.\n\nWhen night falls, the assault begins and you get to see if your defenses hold up. Armed with an axe, a rifle, and whatever consumables you've brought with you, you must do everything in your power to wipe out the assaulting units. At its simplest, you can engage opponents in melee, killing off opponents that you either hadn't set traps for or which manage to survive whatever you'd prepared. While the controls are a little wobbly at times, the combat options are innovative, simple, and very intelligent. When you aren't out busting skulls, however, your job will be to run from trap to trap, activating them at the right time to deal the most damage, or letting the enemy catch your scent and then luring them to their fiery/spiky/bouldery doom. Several enemies are very resilient to your weapon attacks, and without intelligent use of traps they can be nearly unbeatable in hand-to-hand combat. You can get around this by wielding blessed or silver weaponry, but you can only carry one axe at a time, and you can't have it both ways.\n\nI haven't had this much fun with a game in a long, long time. All the trap varieties are useful in their own way, adding interesting layers to the strategy. Plotting out the most effective and efficient layout to take out enemies is a bit intimidating at first, but quickly becomes very satisfying; there's nothing quite like knowing you've set up a fool-proof murder gauntlet and then seeing it work like a charm. Running through the woods, sneaking up on your prey as it munches on the bait you've left out; or ziplining over the forest to engage a band of demons at precisely the right moment... Each night's encounter is demanding enough to make you work for it, and all the elements involved in pulling it off are simply fun. Based purely on the gameplay, Sang Froid is an easy title to recommend.\n\nIt does have a few weaknesses though. The game suffers beneath an occasionally stuttery framerate, no-budget cutscenes, fairly basic character models, a script that's difficult to take seriously, and a voice acting cast made up of amateurs (several of whom likely have English as a second language). This is more than counterbalanced by a gorgeous musical score, an unorthodox and inventive setting that drowns out the actual writing, and the stellar gameply mentioned above. If it weren't for the fact that nobody seems to know it exists, I'd say Sang Froid has all the makings of a truly great cult classic.","July 1, 2014","true","11.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But there are a few differences that set it apart from Orcs Must Die!.\n\nFirst difference is that there is more or less one map. But that map grows and evolves as one progress through the campaign. Rivers freezing over or a section of forest being cleared opens up new paths for enemies to attack your buildings, but it also means more ways to delay those enemies and  more fronts to ambush them as well.\n\nSecond, trap placement emphasizes location and combination over sheer quantity. One can only place traps at dawn and cannot be moved once the night begins. This means one must take the time to consider enemy paths (and later on, wind direction), when placing traps so that one may effectively deal with each wave of enemies. In addition, traps often work best when used in combination with other traps. While an explosive barrel may take out many enemies that just happen to pass by, bait can placed near the barrel so that enemies bunch up in a small area, thus greatly increasing the kill count.\n\nFinally, fighting feels more intense and personal. There are relatively few enemies per level, but that only means each one of them poses more of threat. Melee attacks share the same Stamina resource used for sprinting and rolling, so one can only chain up a limited number of attacks before leaving one open for a counter attack. Ranged weapons are reflective of the time period, so each shot must be used effectively as the weapon only hold one bullet and takes several seconds to reload. But thankfully one can intimidate enemies so that they hesitate to attack, thus buying precious time to replenish stamina and to reload.\n\nOverall, I recommend this game to anyone who is looking for game that test one's planning skills as well as anyone who is looking to experience a new setting in videogames.","July 19, 2013","true","47.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The strategic and action combines perferctly. The more strategic in the traps you are, the less effort need to be done in combat, but traps cost money and time to build, what really makes you need to be strategic decisions about what traps you will put to balance with the difficulty of the combat, so you can save money for new weapons and accesories.\n\nIt also have an leveling system to help you, but that was a little weak, you only gain a skill point when evolve, nothing more, so you don't get stronger for later in the game, also there is no way to get more exp then beating the stages, so basicaly after each stage you gain a skill point to spend in the skill tree.\n\nEven if this is a lower point, it doesn't mess the fun in the game at all. The game is at the right size, 20 stages, and have two difficulties (which is the brother you choose to play), so when you beat the game in normal dificulty, you will end up going for the hard to get all the achivements. Achivements are not impossible to get, as so many games are, what makes it fun to get the 100%. Anyway, the game is great, I recommend.

Each 'mission' you have a set amount of money to spend on traps... the more efficient you are at not wasting money, the more money you can spend on better gear/upgrades/etc. This creates a sort of minimalist approach.. you're constantly trying to place as little traps as possible, and setting up a perfect wave by wave traps and backup plans that you can fall back on if something doesn't hit. The feeling of satisfaction you get when you pull of a perfectly planned 5+ wave defense is like nothing I've felt before in a game. Even when something goes amiss and you manage to pull through by the skin of your teeth.. it's great. There's enough RPG skill tree mechanics and 3rd person fighting skill to make it a lot more 'alive' then your normal TD game, too. Buy it! You won't regret it.","December 15, 2013","true","11.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Games like Orcs Must Die and Sanctum seem to lead the pack in this realm but Sang-Froid has emerged to be my favorite of this style of game.  First off, I love the aesthetic of the game.  The frozen Canadian frontier in December during the 1800s really appealed to me.  Couple this with the werewolf and Native American lore and I was hooked.  There is story here.  The voice acting and animation definitely show it's indie roots (meaning not that great) but unlike other games of this ilk, I actually paid attention to the narrative.\n\nGameplay wise, strategy is key.  Know where to place your traps and what kind of traps to use is crucial.  The planning phase of this game ended up being more instrumental to me than any other tower defense game.  It was extremely satisfying during missions to here a trap go off somewhere in the distance and know I had a kill.  The combat might be the weakest part of this game.  You could say it was "challenging" but at times it just seemed clumsy.  I would often swing my ax at an enemy and get caught in a combat animation that would leave me vulnerable.  I don't know if this was intentional but it felt frustrating at times.  However, when it worked, I enjoyed it.\nOverall:\nPros:  Decent story, good atmosphere, great strategy, interesting enemies.\nCons:  Clumsy combat, somewhat stiff voice acting.\n\nI would reccommend this game.  Extra reccommendation: play it in the winter when there is snow on the ground outside  if you can.  This definetly added to my enjoyment of the game.","December 25, 2013","true","14.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You set up your traps during the day and defend your buildings at night using traps, axe, and rifle.\n\nThe monsters come in waves and you need to set up your traps and your positioning to respond to the monsters and their path (which you can later manipulate).\n\nCombine that with a levelling system (arguably on rails as if you survive the night, you'll level but even in failure, you can level up) in which I have yet to find a single ability which wouldn't be useful depending on playstyle. There are two playable characters which determine the difficulty of the game. Jos is a tough strong guy whereas his brother Jack is better with a gun but not as tough.\n\nI had a really good time with this game however, there was not a great deal of play time available. You need to survive 20 nights and the story completes itself. There are plans for a Sang Froid 2 however, the company just released Conflicks on Steam and the follow up might be a while in the making.  I would also have loved perhaps some more choice in the story but for their first effort, Sang Froid was a gem.\n\nI would give it a 8.5 out of 10 but totally worth your time and money.","December 8, 2015","true","23.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/verticalcleave/recommended/227220/","verticalcleave","landwhale","http://steamcommunity.com/id/verticalcleave/","831 products in account","A Tower Defense/Third-Person Action hybrid in the style of "Orcs Must Die!" based on Canadian lore. The game's structure is broken into pre-mission cutscene, pre-mission preparations, the actual defense of your structures on foot, and a post-mission cutscene, with no deviation in this structure. Of the twenty missions available, the first few are thinly veiled tutorials which quickly ramp up in difficulty once supernatural enemies are introduced. Unlike most games, the difficulty doesn't budge; for the most part it was a non-stop train ride through a frustratingly difficult game. I was finding myself quickly frustrated and had to restart missions many times because of accidentally hitting myself with a lethal trap, getting sidetracked defending one objective while another was being destroyed, or just dying from being overwhelmed by enemies I was unprepared to face at full health because they "dodged" a trap I set for them.\n\nWhile the story is good enough to push you forward and explain character actions and interactions, it really feels like it was stretched thin and simply made to build a game around. There are no sidequests, no mini-games or diversions, no non-main story character to chat with, or even any non-story or non-shops to visit while in towns. I loved the game's atmosphere and environments but much of the game feels rushed and lazy, as if the devs said "this is good enough, ship it!" The story also seemed to end abruptly and un-satisfyingly, as if the devs couldn't decide to lead into a sequel or not.\n\nI would love to see a sequel that wasn't such a barebones narrow corridor of gameplay. Simple touches, like actually being able to walk around in towns, would have added much to the atmosphere of the game. This could have been a cozy, atmospheric game with a unique spin on tower defense, but instead it feels like a quick in-betweener for a dev looking to make money for his next big project.","July 5, 2015","false","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even then at the 15 dollar mark I was strongly considering the purchase if the game turned out to be good fun. Sadly, the game flew in under my radar on release and I forgot all about it until I noticed it at the top of the User Review list on the Steam sales page.\n\nYou play as one of two brothers living in the woods on the outskirts of Wolvesdale, somewhere in Canada. The winters are harsh here and the prowling wolves even harsher. Lil' Jos, the burly big brother is more than capable of whopping wolves with his axe, shooting them with his musket, and setting traps. The other Brother, Jack, is a more frail sort and you will have to lean heavily on your ingenuity with traps to succeed with Jack as your choice.\n\nAt the start of the game you are first introduced to Jack and soon thereafter, Jos and their sister Josephine. Josephine has come down with a fever after a travesty at the local church parish involving the pastor. I won't spoil the story for you, as it does a fine job of effortlessly tossing the Christian and pagan at you without being heavy handed or conciously offensive. Christian motifs figure prominently in the story as well as pagan and Native American belief. The characters are well done and push the story along quite well.\n\nJosephine begins to prophecy foreboding events and the two brothers resolve to get her to town for medical treatment. After the nearby bridge has mysteriously burned down, events begin to domino toward ever more sinister happenings. You'll face two varieties of wolves, 2 varieties of werewolves, and a handful of other mythical creatures such as the Amerindian 'Maikan" which amounts to their verison of the werewolf myth, as well as Will-o-Wisps and the like. The Devil plays a major role and is puppetering the corrupted pastor and townsfolk to play out his wicked game in an attempt to destroy the townsfolk, the brothers and their sister. The writing is solid and the voice acting is competent. I'm enjoying the cutscenes story unfold into the missions you are tasked with.\n\nThe main game consists of a pre-game tactical strategy map where you purchase and place any number of devious traps to incapacitate and dispose of the hellish fiends. The game has a good learning curve and introduces you to the myriad devices slowly; as it should. This aspect of the game is very reminiscient of the Bullfrog Dungeon Master games of years gone by. Great fun is to be had plotting your tactics to deal with the many waves of enemies that are tasked with destroying your assorted buildings. To write of all the many traps and how to use them would amount to a miniature FAQ and so I will leave much of that to you, dear reader, to research. To say the developers gave you a treasure trove of gadgets is putting it mildly.\n\nAt the beginning of each match you are also able to use the money you acquire from defeating the creatures to purchase better weapons, ammo and gear. A coventry nearby can bless your bullets or axes, respectively, so as to deal greater damage to the diabloical creatures. The general store sells an ever increasing number of muskets that have authentic descriptions of their real world counterparts with some very nifty trivia thrown in. You also can purchase new gear and ammo. And the hotel furnishes you with an assortment of liquors that have varying effects on your character in battle.\n\nDuring the match proper, you will be scurrying as your very life does depend on it. Following the routes you planned during the pre-game phase you will have to be front and center for certain traps to be effective. The deadly net trap requires you to shoot the net and drop it on the creatures below. If you have a bait present under the net you simply take your time and fire. Otherwise, you'll have to get crafty and 'shout' for your enemy to come inspect the area. Bonfires help buff the 'fear factor' that  keeps the creatures at a distance as they prowl slowly around you looking to strike. During this time you can reload your musket and go for the headshot without worrying about being ripped to shreds.  Fire walls can be strategically placed to alter the route of your enemy. Watchtowers with ziplines to other parts of the map are a lifesaver when you need to 'be there' quickly to prevent destruction of your precious buildings. This is only a smattering of the many traps available. Nevermind all the possibilities on how to use them in conjunction with each other.\n\nAnd I haven't even touched on the player levels. Much like an RPG, you earn experience points that allow you to upgrade many traits. Typical character buffs like more health, stamina, and the like as well as quicker reloading and stronger traps are available. But there are also quite a few unique buffs such as poisoned bait that damages the devouring creature or increasing the damage done as a 'sniper' if you should decide to try for a shot from one of your watchtowers.\n\nI could go on and on about all the neat features of this game with impunity. The game is well balanced and is a blast to play once you grasp the game mechanics. Most of the game elements will feel familiar to the hobby gamer. But by combining them in such a manner requires an enjoyable pause for thought that many modern games no longer ask of you. To have my intelligence and keyboard savvy simultaneously challenged has been a real treat.  The art style is charming and the music very well done. The graphics are rather modest for a modern game and have a World of Warcraft nature to them but serve the game quite well.  Artifice Studio is officially on my list of promising developers to watch.\n\nI cannot recommend this game strongly enough. Especially for the money. A MUST BUY!","October 2, 2014","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I got it when it got Greenlight at it has been more than worth it. Actually would love to see a Tome II with a sequel or prequel.

Your objective is to protect these buildings while eliminating hostile beasts. You can reroute the beasts' paths and set traps along the way.

Lots of interesting Canadian culture and mythology references, fun strategy and execution of your plans. Excellent music. Cutscenes are horribly animated and painful to watch, but in overall this game is worth it.\n\nBem divertido.

Set in mid 19th century in Quebec, the game is a delight to play and for the most part, is amazingly immersive. First, here is a brief about each of the three genre elements:\nTower-defense: The game follows the standard "place towers --> defend against waves" profile. You place defensive and offensive traps in the day, to defend 1 to 5 of your buildings (the number increases from 1 to 5 over 13 levels) in the night. The traps are varied, paths are all well marked, and variation in enemies is also good. The map is amazingly good in global top-down view as well as the zoomed in 3rd person warcraft-like view. No level is frustratingly bad/difficult but each level takes a certain amount of smarts from the players.\nStrategy: The number of factors you have to account for is quite considerable. Placing traps not only take money, they also take up action points. Each day has a set maximum of action points. This makes sure that even if you save up money, the game doesn't become lame easy. Money in itself is pretty tight, at least for the first half. Wanting to buy better gear forces really effficient trap placements. Health, stamina, fear factor, weapons, potions, and later on even wearable items come into play (more on that in next point). Your character also levels up slowly so you can improve certain attributes; however you level up barely 16-17 times and the skill tree has ~40 skills. Thus, this aspect acts as customization suited to your own playstyle. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by the depth and balance of strategy.\nAction: This is the twist factor of the game, and in my opinion, really what makes the game shine. The strategy and tower defense alone were enough actually to make a whole game. But after you place the traps and the night begins you yourself go out with your axe and your gun, carrying potions, items, and 3 types of bullets with you. This aspect adds a LOT of playtime to the game, and makes you execute the traps you placed in the day. You also see your planning unfold in front of you as waves after waves of enemies fall to your cunning traps. There are certain fixed outposts for fast travel as many times waves have enemies rushing in to many buildings simultaneously. The later enemies especially need to be dealt with manually, and there are many traps that make it easier for you - one damage over time, one shooting fireballs, and even a bonfire that temporarily makes the enemies "fear" you. The wind direction also plays a role as your scent is carried to the enemies with the wind. If you are at the wrong place at the wrong time, enemies halfway across the map will smell you and run to you and abandon their fixed paths, wasting your traps and probably killing you.  Again, A+ to the devs for great execution and seamless fusion of first person action with strategy.\nPros:\n-Solid mechanics, no bugs, just the right length to give a satisfying experience while being fun\n-Great balance of all ingredients along with all-round balanced strategy elements\n-Immersive atmosphere, all thanks to amazing folk music selection played at precisely the right pace\n-Two difficullties (so slight replay value)\n-Achievements are decent, they give a kind of "special" challenge, nothing gimmicky\n-Responsive devs (on Steam forum, that I know of)\n\nCons:\n-Voice acting, dialogues and cutscenes in general are the weaker points of the game; nothing game breaking but if the devs were short on cash/talent they could've forwarded the story using comic strip format (like Max Payne), narration format (like the intro video of the game) or maybe even plain written story format\n-Apart from that, I just found the last 20% of the game slightly monotonous, the reasons being:As you proceed in the game and if you are half-decent you have a stockpile of cash even after buying all the best gear for the last 5 levels\nAlong with that, if you're buying all potions from the start and hoarding them, just axe-hacking most waves becomes an easier way out by the end and ridiculously so with the right perks\nLast 5 levels are just 5-6 waves of repeated enemies, no noveltySumming up all 3 points, I think the devs could've had waves with enemies swarming in large numbers by the end levels that would force liberal cash usage and disallow you from brute-forcing it by making you impossibly outnumbered\n\nApart from those nitpicks, the game is really innovative and near-perfect.\nFinal verdict: Recommended!\n8.5/10, well worth the full price.","April 27","true","17.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
