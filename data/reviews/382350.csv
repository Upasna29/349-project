The first team to find all their loot wins the game.\n\n....Yet there is more.\n\nOne player is a devil in disguise and his goal is to murder all the other players whilst trying to hide his identity lest the other players gang up and capture him. The devil, when transformed, is very fast and powerful and especially dangerous to players caught alone, yet it vulnerable to players in groups.\n\nPlayers have to choose whether to focus on the clues and treasure hunt which leaves them more vulnerable to the devil or stay with others which will dilute their loot search time. Teams can also be much more effective in gathering the loot if they split up but that also leaves them much more vulnerable.\n\nPlayers also have to consider whether they wish to share the Devil's identity should they find it out. They could even decieved other players and pretend it is someone else in order to sabotage another teams treasure hunt or break the trust between team mates.\n\nThe mansion itself is very interactive with peep holes, hiding places, traps and secret doors. Good players will learn the mansion and utlilise it effectively.\n\nAnother fantastic aspect to the game is the music. When a player transforms into the Devil a forboding tune acompanies the Devil where he/she wil go and this really sets the atmosphere in the mansion and puts the other players on edge, ya better hide. The other compositions in the game are also very fitting and a few are quite catchy.\n\nI highly recommend this game for people who find the above description compelling. The game certainly is niche and won't please everyone. it is not a shooter and it is not first person. It is what it is and the developers have produced a very polished and playable product that I think is well worth looking into and supporting if it is your kind of thing.\n\nThumbs up. :)","October 29, 2015","true","4.7"," 105 of 110 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","105","110","2","2"

I know it just released, but seriously this should be selling like hotcakes. (Full disclosure I have no experience in the flapjack trade, but I have it on good authority that they are always in high demand.)\n\nIt's an asymmetric 1v11 game. All twelve players are on a scavenger hunt. One of those players is also the Devil.\n\nThe players go around the house in teams of two solving different sets of riddles in order to find a clue. Once all of the clues are found the scavenger hunt is won. Players take turns slapping each other silly in order to delay progress or defend themselves from the actual devil. (In fact, slapping is such a core mechanic that the central area of the map is officially known as Slapfight Central.)\n\nThe disguised Devil player, who can ditch his disguise and transform into the Devil at any time, can win by eliminating all of the 11 players, or by winning the scavenger hunt himself. While transformed as the Devil, he has a much faster walking speed, and a high damage melee attack replaces his slap.\n\nPlayers have a capture meter, that when full allows them to leap and initiate a spacebar mashing "brawl" with the Devil/suspected Devil in disguise in an attempt to capture him and end the game. 1v1 the Devil is afaik impossible to capture, but other players can also leap into the brawl and join in the button mashing to increase the odds of capturing the Devil. The downside to this is that if a player missed the Devil and hits another player a brawl will start with them instead and it cannot be immediately canceled. This is probably my only large problem with the game thus far...\n\nThe map is a multi-story mansion complete with garden, tea room, mausoleum, sewers, torture chamber, evil laboratory, the usual stuff mostly. It is also outfitted with secret doors and passageways, dumbwaiters, traps, and hiding places to help you accomplish your goals. Players who are not the Devil can still use traps to hurt other players or the Devil himself.\n\nThe game features proximity-based open mic chat to facilitate communication with teammates and spying on rivals and/or targets. This can be muted but it is not recommended as a majority of the gameplay takes place through this communication, and there is no typed chat in game. Players can trade information about what they know about the Devils identity, lie about it, or keep it to themselves, which opens up some interesting gameplay strategies and opportunities.","October 30, 2015","true","4.1"," 43 of 48 people (90%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","90","43","48","11","0"

This game is about the gameplay and fun and not about the graphics. Due to this fact, it is possible to play it even with an older machine.\nThere are a lot of characters to choose from. Sadly they are only something visual and do not serve any other purpose. In the future I would love to see that maybe each character has a special ability.  The hidden doors, pathways, shortcuts, places to hide and traps are a lot of fun. However once everybody get to know the map and also all the clues you get for the scavenger hunt (they repeat themselves) it kind of gets boring. Maybe a map generator that will place the current rooms different would be awesome! Another suggestion would be to change the speed and power of the DEVIL because currently it is OP. There is almost no way to escape the devil if you are by yourself! Capturing the devil is currently also a pain in the ♥♥♥ because you have to bash space bar! Maybe it would be more fun to use “a” and “d” alternating. A “Tutorial” button in the main menu wouldn’t hurt anybody because the instructions you get in the loading screen disappear to fast and new players are lost in the first game! Another big thing is that the microphone is constantly turned on. I know that the developers had a plan but some players on the one hand do not like it the fact that everybody can hear them, because maybe they are on teamspeak with friends, at all and on the other hand some microphones are making noises that I never knew they do exist and that is more than just annoying.\n\nSummary:\nThis game has just been released! I have played it since DAY ONE (Kickstarter) and a lot has changed! So I am looking forward that things will change!\nEven with the current - let’s call them “bugs” - it is a lot of fun!","October 30, 2015","true","35.4"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","15","19","2","0"

You get a clue on the whereabouts of the item because the item can still spawn in the next room over... don't think you want to be looking for something for the kitchen in the bathroom but it happens.  Normally it's the first team to find all 14 items wins but there is a DEVIL AMONG YOU who's goal it is to kill everyone before that and not get captured in the process.  Basically they transform into devil form, wack you twice and if no one revives you in 90 seconds, You're dead.   The only defense you have is to try and capture them, or smack them and run and hide.\n\nNow here's the part of the game that makes it feel like early access,  this is probably the third time they fixed how hard it is to capture the devil ((impossible at time of writting)) and even if it was balanced it's a race to who can mash their space bar the most ((or set up a marco x.x)) and the only real way to win is to have a slow devil... I rather it be more logically like hey you have to slap him x times then capture...\n\nAs far as playing a human goes, there is no way to heal up if you take damage from the devil or traps, like easy to fall in or get slapped in, holes in the floor, and if you die and get revived you only get one devil hit or 2 traps worth of health back.  Now for Scavanger Hunt part, It's the same level with the same layout every time.  Throw in the fact that there are rooms you have to know how to get to... like jumping in a tv or another hidden passage, new players don't have a chance till they learn the map, and the team that knows the most about the clues, will always be the team that wins it.  There is not hint system or anything like that either so if you can't figure out the clue, might as well give up...\n\nThat said there is still fun to be had, and the devs are promising patches, one of which later they said will randomize the layout to make it a more fair game but things could always happen.  Right now if you have a couple friends to play this with, it's a fun time, but if you're just buying for yourself, this might not be a good pickup till later.","November 4, 2015","true","7.0"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

So first things first, I absolutely love this game.\n\nThere are several different ways to play the game, which are all fun. If you're the devil, you can try and be sneaky, killing them off one by one, or you can be really gung ho about. Both have their advantages, both have their disadvatages.\n\nAs the survivors you also have different play styles which revolve around the other players in the game. You can try and work together, you know safety in numbers, which is an extremely valid point which I will explain in a minute, or you can go solo. Because most of the time when you encounter other players, everything devolves into a giant slap fight.\n\nNow as I said there is safety in numbers, because it's near impossible to capture the devil solo. Let me explain. The system by which you capture the devil (and also revive others) is button mashing. You have to mash the hell out of your space bar. It seems very contoller-y, so hopefully the game will eventually get full controller support. Because as it is now, I sometimes experience issues where the button mashing doesn't work with controllers.\n\nSomething else, this game really gets to you. The first couple times you play the game you'll be a bit confused. But once you've gotten the hang of it, you could end up being the last person alive besides the devil, with four more items to collect, feeling the tension build further with every item collect, and every time you walk through a door wondering "Is this it? Is this the one where the devil's waiting on the other side?".\n\nSome things that I wouldn't really call cons, but I think could use some adjusting:\n\nThe Sprinting System - Basically your character can sprint for a couple seconds, and if you step on a puddle or walk over a rock you fall over. That's pretty cool. What isn't cool is that when your character runs out of sprint, rather than just slow down to walk they trip. This is something that is gauranteed to happen. Your character will trip when you run out of sprint, which brings up a problem. The devil can sprint forever, and will only trip due to obstacles, he/she also runs ever so slightly faster than you. So if you get chased by the devil, you have to hope you can escape through some scene transition or you're dead. Because nothing stops the devil from camping by your body once you've fallen over.\n\nThe Button Mashing - If this game ever got full controller support, this would be okay, but even then not everyone has a controller. So I think this whole concept needs to be reimagined somehow, because I could totally see this feature being the death of my keyboard.\n\nThe Slapping Feature - You can slap any character and they get slapped aside, and have a period where they have to stand back up and where they are invulnerable. The problem is, slapping itself has no cool down. I've very commonly seen when multiple people are in an area just slapping one another nonstop, not allowing either of them to get their items. I believe that the slap itself should have a cooldown, then people would be less inclined to slap every single person they pass in the halls. After all, wasting that slap on a person only to turn the corner and face the devil would be very bad. That slap could literally be the difference between life and death for them if it had a cooldown. As it is now, when you encounter someone in the hallway, even if neither of you ever stop moving, there is a 90% chance they will slap you.\n\nNow is this game worth ten dollars when it's on sale?\nDefinetly.\n\nIs this game worth fifteen dollars?\nYes.\n\nI would rate this game as a 7/10\n\nAnd I would recommend it.","November 1, 2015","true","9.0"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","0"

There is a bit of a learning curve to the game with the mansion layout/passageways and scavenger hunt riddles but it feels extremely rewarding to master these things.\n\nThe random nature of the scavenger clues makes the game highly replayable.  I was one of the earliest beta testers and the game hasn't gotten old for me.

There are problems that I hope will be addressed, but I'm not going to make a final verdict so easily after it has just launched, since player feedback can still help make the game better than what it is.\n\nFor the most part you spend your time solving riddles which can be broken down as: "Something something [Location] - Something something [What am I?]" - Your task is to figure out who the devil is unless the devil makes it blatantly obvious and goes full-on-aggressive with no sneakiness to their moves (Which is how most 'Devil players' are, while trying to survive, you as the survivors/humans are meant to go on a scavenger hunt! HOBOY!\n\nThere are multiple ways the Devil, and players can win or lose. Deception can play a role in the game, but I'd expect it to be the uncommon path people take. The devil can work together with their legitimate teammate to gather all of the items first while preventing other teams from gathering all the items, thus making it a 'Human + Devil win combo' - Or the devil can win just by killing everyone. Likewise, humans can trump the Devil just by any of the teams finishing the scavenger hunt, or by capturing the devil with mostly everyone working together at that.\n\nWith that comes some of the Cons. Most bugs I had complaints about have been patched up to my knowledge now. The rest I'd argue is that the Devil's pitchfork has too wide of a radius in distance/width when it attacks you, some lag that can frequently happen as well. I'd just address the issue that I find the devil is too overpowered in my eyes, it's TOO easy to win via just going aggressive and attacking everyone as the devil.\n\nLastly, I'd really argue that there should be a Push-to-talk option. (Squeakers, people who have music playing, horrible playback loops through microphones, can't mute players who're annoying, etc)\n\nPros? The game has a slappy, light-hearted humour to it, the riddles can be fun to solve with a partner, proximity communication is a good idea, I enjoy slapping people and hunting them down especially.\n\nOverall - 7/10. There's many things that could make this game so much better, but until then, this feels like it could just be early access-material.\n\nHere's a video I made of some gameplay!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaAncDSTcrg","November 3, 2015","true","12.2"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Official_KwS/recommended/382350/","Official_KwS","KidwithSmurf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Official_KwS/","827 products in account","Devils Bluff is one of the funnest Cartoon styled Hide and Seek games with a twist that I've ever played. This unlike other games in the Hide and Seek genre gives the hiders something else to do other than just hiding or killing the chaser. It lets you answer cryptic clues to find treasure which is way fun. However, this is one of the funnest Hide and Seek type games I've played, like everything nothing is perfect and there are still a few areas which could be fine-tuned which I will elaborate in my Pros and Cons.\n\nPro's\n♦ Amazing Death Spectator Mode (Lets you easily view another living player including the Devil)\n♦ Nice Help Menu (This is very detailed and a nice way to teach the game without having a full on Tutorial)\n♦ Epic Graphics (Each Character and the Map is soo detailed and stunning, just amazing)\n♦ Eargasmic Sound (The Characters, Map Sounds and Music all fit in soo well with the theme of the game)\n♦ Nice Number of Premade Servers based on Skill Level (This is nice as it allows x number of games to quickly start based on skill level without having to create your own and find your own people to fill it)\n♦ Dedicated Servers are Lag Free (I've played a full 12 person match, no spectators and not had any lag)\n♦ Open Microphone Technique suits the game (Many people complain about the fact the Microphone is open. However, with it being open it adds a whole new level of stealthyness to the game that most other games don't have)\n♦ Game Concept is awesome (It's a Treasure Hunt cross Hide n Seek, nothing better than this)\n♦ Gameplay is really fun with Randoms and or Friends (No matter who you play with, you're going to have fun)\n♦ Developers are really friendly and helpful (This is really good as they respond to issues quickly and even play matches with you)\n♦ Cryptic Clues are the right balance of difficulty (This is good as they are not too easy to decipher and not too hard)\n♦ Can easily Stream to Twitch via Main Menu (This is great as all you have to do is login to Twitch with your API etc and you can Stream it)\n♦ Nice balance of traps and hiding spots (Literally there is a hiding spot or a trap where ever you need them without there being too many or not enough)\n♦ Stunning Map (Heaps of well detailed and set out rooms, hiding spots and what not that make the map look stunning)\n♦ Many ways for the game to be won making strategy a key part (Devil can kill everyone, Devil can die, Players can pick up all the treasure, Devil can pick up all the treasure, Devil can pick up some of the treasure + kill someone in first and steal their treasure and thus win. Therefore, it requires a lot of strategy and teamwork to win)\n♦ Price is decent for the amount of fun you are going to have (For the amount of fun you'll have it'll pay for itself)\n\nCons:\n♦ Controls can't be re-mapped in game but can be remapped via the Devils Bluff Configuration Menu before starting the game (This is a weird inconsistency as the Controls Menu doesn't change to the new Controls in the Input Menu)\n♦ Basically controls can't be fully remapped (As the game has many random controls, not being able to set ones you want or would be better suited to is annoying)\n♦ Characters are only skins (Would be good if each character had a unique bonus, aka could see further, run faster, be heard less etc. This would make the Character Selection Process more worth it as at the moment there is no benefit from picking one character over another)\n♦ No way to tell the difference between a Public Match and Private Match Created (As far as I can tell a Public Match isn't listed anywhere and neither is a Private Match. Plus, both created matches have no password, so to join both all you'd need is the title. This isn't bad but it makes having a checkbox saying "Public Match" pointless)\n♦ No way to quickly invite someone to your game via Steams Friend List (This is annoying as they have to load the game, click find and type in the name)\n♦ Eventually people could just memorize the clues and find the items each match (Not certain to how many different clues there are, but it seems like this could eventually happen if people played enough as there is only one map)\n♦ Can create a Public or Private Game with no name (The game shouldn't let you progress in creating without a name, as the only way to find and join a Private/Public game is by searching the game name)\n♦ If the game becomes 1v1 can take ages (This happens because the game map is quite large and it can take forever for the Devil and the Player to find each other which can be annoying)\n♦ No way to tell how much Treasure someone has found (This is annoying because you never know how close a team is to winning)\n♦ Easy to pick up and pass time with as you can have a game or two and just close (Even though it's hard to predict the time frame of a game, if you are bored and want to kill a few hours... this game works perfectly as you can easily start a game with minimal wait time and just play right away)\n\nOther Points:\n♦ I found the Controls for keyboard and mouse to be great (I only used Keyboard to play and Mouse). However, as I stated some people may want to re-map controls which you really can't do and there is an inconsistency with some help menus telling you different controls/buttons that don't do what they say they do. Other than this I found controls to just work and be easy to use.\n\nOverall, even though there are a few cons, they are only minor points which could be fixed to help improve the game. Therefore, as the Devs are one of the friendliest I've met, the gameplay is smashing and the fact you are guaranteed 100% of the time to have a laugh and enjoy your game with or without friends... then I recommend you pick up a copy of this game.","October 29, 2015","true","5.0"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sonoralax/recommended/382350/","sonoralax","Sonora","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sonoralax/","456 products in account","GameplayI can't say much on the nature of the game, since I don't have a lot of hours on it yet, but Devil's Bluff seems to be  a rather charming version of Town of Salem. You're tasked with the duty to find treasure and scavenger clues while keeping in mind that, within the mansion walls there are 11 other folks, one of whom is the Devil. The randomly assigned Devil is out to, you guessed it, kill you and it is the scavenger hunters duty to either win the hunt or be the hunted. Spooky...\n\nThe mansion is quite large, so there is definitely a ton of map to explore. Even in the little amount of time that I've played, I know for sure that there is more to the map than meets the eye. You're able to run away from other players, hide in various barrels and crates, and traverse through secret passageways and set off remote traps. This keeps up the tension between players, while also offering a nice way to relax and mess around with friends.\n\nGraphicsThe graphcis are, simply put, adorable. You can't really go wrong with these small cartoony characters dressed up in Halloween costumes. They are also quite refreshing: not everyone wants smooth graphics at the sacrifice of amazing gameplay. Devil's Bluff offers both decent graphics with decent gameplay. Win-win situation.\n\nMusic & SoundYour typical retro style music that is befitting of the genre. Personally, I was getting annoyed with the repetitive nature of the music, but the small sounds here and there helped cut that up a bit. You have your typical "falling down", "punching", "dizzy", etc., sound effects that help add on to the cuteness factor of the game.\n\nControlsI'm not a big fan of the controls. It's pretty odd, with keybinds being your typical W, A, S, D to navigate, but J, I, K, L to investigate and the likes. I'll most likely get use to it in the future, but it feels sort of awkward. Thanks for adding the control guide to the menu, however. Much appreciated since this was a bug that bothered me pre-release.\nOn another note, I seem to always screen freeze when the Devil has been killed. Is this an issue with everyone, or is it just me? I usually just X out of the game to fix the problem, but if there's an actual solution, I wouldn't mind hearing about it!\n\nOverall, I think this is a great game to play with friends. It has high replay value and I see it has a very good game for many streamers.\n\nI've played mainly with strangers so far, and since I'm a noob I don't really know what's going on: a tutorial may be nice when you're first starting out because gameplay doesn't pause long enough for you to learn. I'm sure that when my friends have time though, we'll definitely give this game a good round or two.\n\n8/10","October 29, 2015","true","0.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Player who are the murder can transform to devil, in that form he is very fast and strong. A game require using a microphone, because only if a players do good cooperating can catch the murder/devil. The map is very high and have a lot of parts, can be rally enjoyable with a lot of players. A mansion also very interactive, have a lot of traps, hiding place, lakes and secret doors. Also a gem have a good sounds and music what add really good atmosphere.\n\n\n\nSo my verdict\n\n+good idea\n+can be really enjoyable with a friends\n+good atmosphere\n+good sounds/music\n\n-only multiplayer\n-empty serves\n-high price\n\nSo i think not a bad game if you found a lot players online or have a some friends who want play it with you. Game based ad good idea and sounds good too to game, but all multiplayer based game only in that time alive when have enough players, this game not have for now this, in most times servers are empty. And also i think they should try do single player mod with bots. The price in 15 euro/dollar is too much i think, especially because no players online so you cant play it.\n\n6.5/10","November 16, 2015","false","2.1"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","13","23","0","2"

The mansion is pretty big and interesting to walk around in. The point of the game is to finish up the scavenger hunt alone before the Devil trys to kill you or before another team collects them all. There are many traps and secrets in the game that makes it intersting plus you can slap other players. Who doesnt love slapping lol. Would be nice if there was a trial version or a demo for new players who are deciding to buy this game since there are not many players playing this game anymore.

It's not often I see a unique take on murder-mystery, and usually when I do they suck, but I am really enjoying this one. "Slapfight Simulator 2015" is what this game should be called, and it's a must-have.","October 29, 2015","true","1.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

Watch the trailer, and you get the exact idea of what it really is. When playing it you will quickly get the hang of it and the fun part kicks in. Personally I love their graphic style and found the gameplay very smooth. The devs also seem to be very commited to this project, they are very community oriented and do update the game with bug fixes. Oddly, I see it has very few reviews and a small player base to this date, which I really do not understand why.

If you got lucky you saw 2-3 players online and one would join your lobby. But this game is a 12-player coop multiplayer and not designed to play with 2 or 3 players.\n\nAfter more gamers got keys for the beta it was getting better, I had some games with 5-7 players. But still the game didn't satisfied me. Mostly because it depends on how people play this. Communication for example is based on audio interaction, but often I could not understand what people say due to noicy audio.\nNo idea if its the fault of the game or the hardware players are using.\n\nThe map is so huge, that you won't see some players at all. Maybe the map should adapt to the amount of players currently in the game.\n\nThe worst thing is, that nobody can join a game that is already started. So if you accidently started a game with 3 players... well perhaps start again.\nOr when you are with more player, but suddenly players decide to drop out.\n\nI hope there will be improvements, will keep a look out for update news and try this out later again and update my review\n\n-- Notice: I got a key from the devs to test the game and write a review --","October 29, 2015","false","3.0"," 21 of 46 people (46%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","46","21","46","3","0"

The devs gave everyone who played the beta a free key, and they delivered, so I promised I would still buy a copy (for a friend) if they stayed true to their word, so I did as well. No regrets.\n\nAbout the Game: Hide and Seek. Scavenger Hunt. Clue. A dash of Murder? Who can you trust? Your teammate? The other 10 players? Yourself? No one. You must not trust anyone with your life as it will be short-lived if you do so. You're spawned in a mansion with your teammate and 10 other players, one secretly being the Devil, and you must complete the ultimate scavenger hunt to free yourself from this haunting chase.\n\nMy personal Suggestion(s): 1. Open mic is a great idea on paper, but the only downside aside from the obvious mic spam from some users is the lack of ability to communicate with others you're already in a group chat with. Perhaps the ability to mute yourself in the game? I know that degrades the experience in a way, but I'd hate to be chatting normally to friends, but be techincally spamming in others ears within proximity.\n\n2.

The concept is great, but the gameplay doesn't actually match what the trailer or description convey. If you're looking for a deception game like Town of Salem, Werewolf, or BSG where you want to find the secret traitor, you will be disappointed. If you're looking for a scavenger hunt racing game where sometimes you stray and try to tackle someone instead, you will enjoy this.\n\nIt is not an 11v1 game: it is a 2v2v2v2v2v2 game where one of the teams is lucky enough to have a faster character that can kill you. The devil is not the "1," because he can still win with his partner. Also, the trailer says things like "betray" and "deceive," but the current win condition encourages the devil to cooperate with his team member. There is no incentive to betray at all. And no, I don't mean "there is an incentive to betray but it's more strategic to cooperate"; I mean there is literally 0 incentive to betray. Because of this, it's not really part of the gameplay.\n\nIt's still fun, but the gameplay experience is very different than what the trailer and concept description would have you believe. It's not like Werewolf or Mafia or any deception game, really. I'd liken it more to The Ship (which is cheaper,  has a larger player base, and bots to play against even if you can't find a lobby).\n\nI do think it's worth the $5 I paid for it, but it's not worth $15, especially if you can't play during the scheduled times in the discussion or if you don't have enough friends to guarantee a game. Also, there were so many bugs found within the first month of release that it really felt like I was paying to be a part of a beta instead of paying for a full game. A lot of them have been fixed now, but it's still disappointing that there hasn't been a dev update since December of last year.","May 30","false","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
