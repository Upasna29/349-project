It was just too much fun.\n\nWARNING: This is still in-progress though it actually has a lot of features already in, i.e you can play it now. However, it does crash for some people (me and my friend were on stationaries and crashed a lot; while the other friend was on a laptop and she seemed to not crash as often) if you are one of those people who think alpha and beta status = finished, no bugs. Then please stay away (from everything.)\n\ntl;dr - Great game, a lot of fun, great humor (unlike Borderlands 2) but it does have bugs as it is early access, if you can't handle a couple of bugs: don't buy it.","November 25, 2013","true","6.4"," 113 of 137 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","113","137","0","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/recommended/249950/","pepsimanvsjoe","pepsimanvsjoe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/","1281 products in account","My approach to reviewing this game is going to be at odds with its whimsy. After all, this is an action-RPG about saving the land of Shmoop from an evil chicken. I probably shouldn't take it so seriously. While I appreciate what Forge Quest is going for, I don't think it does enough to establish itself as either a fun adventure or a challenging game.\n\nAs the hero-in-training, you'll brave the depths of four dungeons, contend with a handful of bosses, and craft superior gear. As far as the genre goes, Forge Quest offers plenty of diversity, with strong mechanics to back it up. At the start, you're given the choice between numerous classes. However, like Dark Souls, this is mostly just for starting out. As you gain levels, you can put skill points into fighter, thief, and mage classes. Your identity is not limited, because with enough experience you could become the mightiest arch-mage ninja warlord in Shmoop.\n\nThe combat falls somewhere in-between Diablo and The Legend of Zelda. Naturally you'll want the strongest gear, so you can crush your enemy in numbers. However, you'll also have to consider weapons that suit your style of play. A sword is suitable for most situations, but you might appreciate the strength of a great sword. The bow is the trademark of any good adventurer, but throwing knives are so much faster. Each weapon behaves differently, and has their own special technique when the attack button is held down. Essentially, you have to do more than just click on enemies to kill them. Numerous spells and weapon-skills round out your offensive options. My only complaint is that the mechanics aren't sufficiently tight. Enemies can and will hurt you even if it doesn't look like their attacks actually touch. You'll adapt to it in time.\n\nUnlike most action-RPGs, the strongest gear is crafted, not acquired via monster pi√±atas and luck. Numerous weapons and armor are dropped when enemies are destroyed, but most of it is junk. By taking all this garbage to the forge, you can craft something powerful. All loot has its own level. Every piece can be strengthened up to 10 levels past their current. Equipment can also be slotted to hold ability-boosting runes. It's a very well-done system, too well-done really. While this likely won't be a major issue in the first play-through, crafting will lead to the player becoming overpowered.\n\nAllow me to explain just how quickly crafting can get out of control. Stats are decided through exponential increases. Early on, you'll only get a few HP when you level up. Eventually this number goes to the 10s, the 100s, the 1000s, and beyond. Enemy stats rise in much the same manner. As long as you keep your gear updated, you'll hardly notice a difference no matter what difficulty you're on. The numbers are massive, but actually change very little. To really shatter the balance, you can pile on the runes and max out particular skills. I'm at the fourth dungeon of my Hard-difficulty play-through. My twin-axes have a DPS of 150,000+. I don't doubt that there are other players at the same point with even stronger weapons. It's absolute overkill and renders much of the replay-value moot. There's no real difficulty to a game, when bosses can be defeated in a couple hits.\n\nNow I won't claim that this experience will be the same for every adventurer, but once you get a basic grasp of the crafting system, you will become overpowered. You could limit yourself by not crafting. However, this means you'll have to rely entirely on drops and your grasp of combat techniques. This is a worrying situation to consider, because the difference between 10 or even 5 levels of gear can be dramatic. The developer could always patch the game and make crafting less useful. This is an idea I'm torn on.\n\nYou may remember a game for the Xbox 360 called Kingdom Under Fire: Circle of Doom. Like Forge Quest, it's an action-rpg with an overpowered crafting element. In that game, there were orange potions you could find. Basically, they worked as a multiplier when crafted to a weapon or armor. Most players just stocked up on these potions, and were able to turn their starter gear into something powerful enough to kill the final boss in one hit. It got to a point where nobody really knew how crafting was supposed to work. Eventually the orange potions were patched/nerfed severely, and everyone either gave up or stuck to the previous version. This is an extreme scenario, but I think it's worth mentioning. Balancing is an especially delicate aspect of Action-RPGs. You can't simply fix what was broken, or you risk making the game less fun. Difficulty has to expand outward by bringing in new challenges. Harder play-throughs shouldn't only result in stronger monsters. Give these creatures new abilities, throw in some new foes, and change things around when appropriate.\n\nEven if I ignore the game-breaking crafting, it's difficult to muster an appreciation for the dungeons. Seeing as how they're randomized, it's important to include numerous ideas, so that every floor has something new to discover. Instead, repetition sets in far too quickly. The situations tend to be basic. There is a room, sometimes it is filled with enemies, maybe there's a block-pushing puzzle, or it could hold traps and treasure. I won't ask for innovation, but some variety would have done wonders. This might be a symptom of the locales, which are all too familiar to RPG fans. Instead of four large dungeons, I would have preferred to see eight smaller ones. It'd be nice to explore a robot factory, a haunted cathedral, or even a castle in the sky.\n\nMultiplayer is available, although I think it'd benefit new players more than veterans. Teaming up to take on a deadly foe loses much of its appeal, when said foe is no match for even one hero. I didn't have any luck getting an online game started. One day I'll have to sit down and figure out port-forwarding.\n\nWith its charming voxel-graphics and light-hearted story, Forge Quest is sure to offer a pleasing first impression. However, it lacks the crucial elements that make for a highly-replayable action-RPG.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","June 24, 2015","false","15.4"," 120 of 148 people (81%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","81","120","148","4","0"

Yes it is early access and they are still working on it, there is no release date for a final version. The developer care so much and are always present in the forums and help if you mention problems or bugs and solve them in no time.\n\nWhen I bought it, I had my first play through and after this I could start on a higher difficulty with the same character. I had my second play through and got the invitation to play the pre-release of the new version. Now, with the latest update, they over thought everything they made before, changed all dungeons and now on my third play through I have the feeling to play a brand new game!\n\nYou start with your character and your sword in a small village. You talk with some people and choose to become a hero, start with the tutorial and your first dungeon in which you have to solve puzzles, avoid mean traps and fight monster mops, mini bosses and the final boss at each level. Don‚Äôt forget to collect the loot, weapons, boots, gloves, shields, helmets, gold to prove you always have the best one attached. Combine the runes you find, put them into the sockets to make your weapons and armor much more powerful.  With the gold you purchase better weapons, potions and (if you like to) dresses and funny hats (you will do this later, when you have more gold as you need). Also you can buy pets, which are powerful helper in the dungeons. Some can do hard attacks, other spit fire, stun enemies or just take all the agro so you have a free hand to cast spells.\n\nSpells? Of course you earn experience points with every kill you make and every new level you reach gives you one point to spent for spells and perks. If you spent enough points for one class  you can choose your subclass with even better abilities. Feel free to spent points for Warrior and Mage, this can be a good combination and depends on your style you‚Äôll play.\n\nYou really should get this game if you like dungeons, puzzles, monster mobs and tough bosses. It‚Äôs really worth its money! Get it for your friend as well to play it in multiplayer!\n\n+ Random beautiful designed dungeons\n+ Good Puzzles\n+ Tough enemies and bosses\n+ Plenty of loot\n+ Customization with dresses\n+ Contains chickens\n+ Multiplayer with up to 4 players\n\n- Often way too much loot so your inventory is full and you have to discard or sell them\n- Puzzles too easy\n","January 14, 2015","true","68.8"," 28 of 32 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","28","32","3","0"

Being in the state that it is now I feel this game is what cube world should of been. The classic voxel graphics, the amazing soundtracks, the dynamic sound effects,and the way the gameplay and skill builds feel. This game is in early access so it has a lot of work to be done on it,but the queston is, is it worth it for the stage that it is in right now? I would say yes. This game does not feel like an over reapeated era of gaming, it feels new and imporve and not a voxel game reapeat. There are 9 classes to pick from you can link different build together to make other unique class builds so no class build is alike,and it also features in the game a sandbox mode where you can modify quests. So if you're a sandbox building type of gamer forge quest is also for you. With that being said this game is, and I reapeat this game is not a minecraft or cube world rip off! It has it's own feel and unique features.The boss fights are also very unique, they all have speical entrances when they appear.Bosses also have unique spiecal abililtes and boss stages to make the boss fights feel more in depth and bring a more intense fast paced rpg combat feel.Also, I would like to note that in this game which alot of other games lack in is a companion fighting systems. In forge quest you can have a companion to fight with you like dogs, baby dragons,lizzard,and etc. note right now you can only obtain the dog as a pet, but later on other pets will be able to obtain. I also would like to note the maps, and dungeon depth is great , but could be change a bit like being able to see your friends on map and to be able to enlarge the map or world map in a dungeon. But, like i said its a early access game so you have to paitent. In all i'm very happy with this purchase, and can't wait until this game is released. so what are you waiting for? Go pick up forge quest today you wont regert it!","December 17, 2013","true","11.5"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","15","17","0","0"

I bought this game with a friend to enjoy a simple dungeon crawler, but it really failed to meet my already low expectations. Here are a few of the problems I found with this game:\n\nToo easy. Probably the biggest issue was that it was never a challenge once you get a couple levels up. Bigger issue is that it dosnt seem to be balanced for multiplater at all, so the same amount of MOBS split between two people makes it twice as easy.\n\nNot enough divercity. In each dungeon there is 3 or 4 enemy types that you will kill over and over. There all the same brain dead "move to player and attack" AI, nothing really changes the game up to much. I've seen worse mob assortment, but in a game where all you do is grind, it becomes really tiresome.\nEquipment has the same issues as well, theres a few different types of armor and weapon, but you'll stick to one and use it and it's hight stat varients for basically the entire game.\n\nThe dungeon puzzles are all the same drawn out push rocks around ala pokemon and do nothing other than pad the games play time.\n\nOver all this game was a very boring and stale experience.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lavender-sliggoo/recommended/249950/","lavender-sliggoo","Havi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lavender-sliggoo/","156 products in account","This game is a great deal of fun if you like the voxel art style and Diablo-like play. Just so there's no confusion, though.. it looks a bit like Minecraft but that's just a stylistic choice. There's no in-game building.\n\nProbably my favorite part is the loot system. All loot is meaningful (except for maybe potions, but that's a personal choice that I don't use them very often). This is because you're constantly upgrading your gear by combining unwanted pieces of gear with the stuff you want to use, leveling it as you go. There's also a huge variety of runes you can socket into your gear for better stats.\n\nI'm big into co-op multiplayer games, and this one is a lot of fun with a few friends. I started playing in Early Access, and i was pleasantly surprised to find that multiplayer runs nearly flawless, which is a rarity. Most of the Early Access multiplayer games I've played lately have had very buggy networking code.\n\nThat said, I am a bit disappointed this game has gone to full release. While the game itself is finished and the game play is superb, it is very, very buggy and the developers have not worked out enough of the kinks in my mind to really call this a finished game. I play with 3 other friends online, and one had a lot of issues just getting the game to run without crashing, UI disappearing, weird stuff like that. All of us have encountered game breaking bugs like hard crashes and controls locking up. I originally wanted to play on Linux but for some reason couldn't even get it started (Ubuntu 15.04), I had to run it on my Win7 machine instead.\n\nSo if you can't handle a bit of flakiness from the game, you might want to hold off on buying for a little while. On the other hand, the devs have been very responsive (check the forums) and are constantly pushing patches. But even that's kind of a mixed blessing as they frequently break as many things as they fix.\n\nOn the whole though, I am very satisfied with the game and hope that it only improves from here on out!","May 31, 2015","true","17.9"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Lots, it's great (and you get a stash, but not a shared stash)\nHas a sense of humour\nParty play! Works well, even with latency, group buffs for everyone!\nPets, have your own follower, each with their own unique abilitiy to complement you\nSkill reset is possible! It's got a price-tag, but if you think you screwed up you can undo it\nHaven't encountered many bugs (2 to be exact), so it's good to see them being patched/fixed\n\nCons:\n\nRe-playability may be an issue for some, it has a game+ sort of mode, but only the same 4 dungeons (which are big)\nMay be confusing to begin for people not familiar with RPG/Dungeon Crawl gameplay\nDifficulty scaling may need work, at this point I can't vouch for higher difficulties\nGame black-screens when you close the window, this persists through windowed and fullscreen mode (game runs in the background, but you can't see to click or rectifiy)\nNewer players may struggle to understand the scaling resource cost, it isn't properly reflected in skill cost descriptions\nPets are currently lack-luster in terms of damage/functionality\nSkill bar slots are quite limited, it's not possible to cycle to a second skill bar or use F-keys etc.\n\n\nIt comes across as a voxel-based game with similarities to games like Torchlight, with references to quite a few things (the more obvious ones being things like Zelda, which was cool and somewhat nostalgic).\n\nI personally found it very easy to pick up and learn, with most things being quite intuitive and any issues I had, I could check the in-game help/guide. That said, I had to explain a few concepts to people I got to play, the big one being socketing (the only confusion I had was seeing the rarity and mixing it up with the socket colour), I'm not entirely sure how this could be streamlined, perhaps a small image in the guide with arrows.\n\nItemization seems good, as of posting this I've only cleared normal and started intermediate on one character (plus a few others close to clearing normal), I've found that it has potential to go quite far, with the inevitable grind for the perfect socket combinations, unique drop of the item you want, etc. This is of course fine, assuming that the challenge remains present. In my current iteration, I've found that with enough gear refines and appropriate sockets, even without building defensively at all, there's no threat from monsters or traps. This of course may change in higher difficulties, but there should still be some kind of progression.\n\nIn terms of progression, I found the first dungeon and a half scales pretty linearly, then there was a gear spike where sockets and refines became more viable, new skills unlocked and suddenly what was a pain to deal with (healing wolf packs with resistance) became easy, this is completely okay, as long as there comes another stage of difficulty.\n\nAnyway, going on, skill selections are good, being able to cross-class your trees is great. Want to be a rogue with some magical prowess? No problems. Want to be a barbarian with sentry guns for backup? You can do that! I think that's a good thing, it allows build diversity. Could lead to further itemization with +skill level on a rune or added flavour on weapons/armour. I found it slightly perplexing being able to progress down one side of the tree, but then unable to come from the final skill back to the top layer (in order to skil a skill I don't want), you can only go up the tree, I guess.\n\nResource costs for skills might seem steep at first, but this becomes more logical (and requires further investment into gear) at higher levels. Currently there's quite a few weapon choices, although more would always be welcome. Certain base items won't start dropping until specific stages of the game. By the end of the first playthrough, you should have seen most/all of them.\n\nI like that there's higher difficulties, where you can keep your character, but I feel the endless dungeon mode (rng maps, map mods, possibly with influence) which I think I saw mentioned somewhere would be a good improvement for later gameplay, especially if new areas could be introduced (or new monsters).\n\nParty difficulty scaling is great, while not everyone will welcome it, it stops the game feeling too easy with group-orientated skills. Did I mention there's a support sub-class? Group-buffs? No? Well I should have!\n\nSpecific skills may be over-tuned, while it's great having that really high cost ultimate ability that deals loaaads of damage at max rank, it's not so great if it one-shots the boss.\n\nPets. Cool feature, feels lack-luster. There's room here for much more. More pets, more utility for them, longer durations? Give them an auto-attack or make them collect gold. In their current iteration they deal pitiful amounts of damage. This may be due to a level discrepancy (i.e. pet lv.25 vs monster lv.31) but I found that they weren't useful. By making the cooldown more powerful, people might be incentivised to build around pets. Potential to have all pets summoned at once? (could lead to screen clutter, especially in group-play) would make using pet-runes viable.\n\nSkill bar is somewhat limiited, which forces you to choose your skills carefully (that's good), but having pets also require a skill bar slot, to properly use, so do consumables. Health potions are pointless, almost, the only reason I found to use them was if I had no other means of healing early-game (or I face-tanked traps later on). I feel a second skill bar would be greatly beneficial, it would allow for more diversity with skills, quality of life with pets/potions/town scroll, etc.\n\nA skill-reset is possible, that's great, unfortunately it might also make new characters somewhat obselete. The only real difference in making a new character is the starting gear and which of the 3 base classes you use as a start-point. The rest is purely cosmetic (which you can override) or can be changed in a few skill-points.\n\nLastly, mobility skills. There's only one. Leap. Mobility skills are sort of a quality-of-life thing, not having to run 200 steps in the wrong direction to get back to that one item is a nice QoL, admittedly that could be seen as reducing the life-span of the game, but there's still that same element of back-tracking and exploration without that. One mobility-orientated skill (Dash doesn't count) would be nice for each class (not all, rather 1 per base/sub-class in total, i.e. mage gets a short-range teleport, rogue gets a vanish trick).\n\nAnyway, I'm sure there's stuff I missed, but that's my (fairly detailed) impression. I like this game and I'd recommend it, I've given copies to a couple of my friends and it's pretty fun to play in groups. I hope to see more challenge/replayability in the future. I'd probably give it a 7.5/10. That's comparing games in it's genre from established publishers with a lot more financial backing. It's a bit more niche than Diablo or something like that, but it's a good game, it's got potential to be pushed into something that can be played for hundreds of hours, it's just not quite there yet. Is it worth the price-tag? Maybe not for everyone, but if you've played (and enjoyed, hopefully) the likes of games like Torchlight, or just like the genre, give it a go.","July 4, 2015","true","34.0"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","3"

Dungeons seem a bit directionless at times, and as far as crafting goes... its hardly a prominant point in the game. I can dissesmble a high ranking piece of gear for the reciepe, but then I can only craft a lower gear, which is fine.. but, the only way to upgrade the gear.. is with kits, that can be found in the dungeons (not so frequently either). Crafting dust is too abundant.. and if you harvest ore (by playing a game of jewel quest.. without the chain combos).. after loading a game again in the same place or even exiting the dungeon you will have all tapped out ore ready to be havested again. Basically, I thought I was going to be doing some major crafting in order to progress further in the game.. but instead, i'm just buying or finding all my gear.

You pick up weapons, level up when killing monsters, fight bosses, and collect gold. It has an item fusion system where items can be fused together to create higher-level versions of the same item (if you've played Warframe, it's like that).\n\nThe voxel engine is refreshing - it beats the tired "pixel game" style currently in vogue. But there's no environmental destruction or creation. Or, really, *any* destruction that can't be found in a normal game. There's also practically no detail to the game, so it feels pointless to use a voxel render (if it even IS a voxel renderer) for this.\n\nAnd worst, the game is just repetative. There's ten levels to the first dungeon. Every enemy requires 6-20 hits with your sword to beat, and magic is laughably crippled (mana regen is nearly nonexistant, and spells have very low DPS compared to regular attacks). The pacing is awkward and uneven, leading to difficulty cliffs before you find a specific item that allows you to get over them. There doesn't seem to be a death penalty, so more than once I found myself intentionally dying just to get full health. Running back down the dungeon took less time than running out, healing in town, and coming back.\n\nThe humor is nice, but the lack of gameplay options, uninteresting visuals, and generic gameplay just don't make me want to come back to it. Which is a shame, since it's clear that it's very polished (in the sense that it's smooth, has full-featured content, doesn't have glitches, and won't crash) and has a lot of work put into it.","January 23, 2015","false","2.1"," 77 of 145 people (53%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","53","77","145","7","1"

The only puzzle I've come across are pressure plate puzzles where you just need to step on pressure plates in the right order.\n\nFrom what I've seen the multiplayer looks very fun, you can have one person playing a tanky warrior and another person playing a healer etc. The combinations are endless!\nBearing in mind: I haven't played the multiplayer.\n\nPros:\nVery fun combat,\nGreat humour,\nPlenty of references and easter eggs to find.\n\nCons:\nI feel it lacks on the skills side of things,\nLacks puzzles.\n\nOverall it is an extremely fun game and well worth the ‚Ç¨9.\nIf you don't buy it, atleast keep an eye on the game.\n\nMy rating: 9/10","December 2, 2013","true","10.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","2"

The classes are diverse and have their own interesting abilities to go along with them. The dungeon's designs are unique in their own ways and really bring out some of the core features of the game. The Boss's are difficult and have their own special attacks, aside from the fact most of them die to the chicken.\n\nPros:\n\n- Interesting Storyline\n- Interesting crafting system, could be more streamlined\n- Classes are fun, have different aspects, have build up to more advanced classes suiting your playstyle\n- Spells and abilities are unique to their classes and suit the builds of that character\n- Weapon system is intuitive and easy to use\n- Inventory system is well organized\n- Differently sculpted items, some better fit classes, same with armors\n- Cool pets\n\nCons\n- Dungeons are extremely difficult to navigate, and can take upwards of an hour to complete if you take the wrong paths\n- There are some spots where you can get trapped in by monsters and easily killed\n- The crafting system is difficult to understand and use, could be more intuitive\n- After a certain point, leveling and getting money becomes a grind, as it usually does in games like this\n- Although the story progresses, a lot of it is similar to previous points in the game\n- Pets can get stuck, lost\n\nOverall Forge Quest is an extremely fun game to play, but the dungeons can get tedious as you complete floor after floor looking for the right door to take. The pets are fun to have around but can get in the way. Also having to activate the pets every time you want them to attack can get annoying.\n\nLet me know if this review helps, but please, this is just my opinion.\n\nCheers\n\nYour local janitor","November 12, 2014","true","15.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The story is actually pretty good and heart warming. Graphics are pretty good and the combat is very smooth and even difficult on easy mode. Mobs will swarm you so that makes you think about strategies and how you approach your enemy. The game has a borderlands loot system along with skyrim upgrades feel. The Looting WGBPO system in Borderlands is in. The skyrim upgrade feel when you combine equipment together and improve it's stats so it can never be outdated. Getting a shield is also highly recommended it's a good stalling tool because shields void ALL damage but has a limited health counter. This was well worth the buy considering it is discounted.

One big one is the sorting of armor and weapons. The gloves having different titles is really annoying because you end up having like 50 different glove recipes. The rest is pretty much nitpicking. The gun effects don't work, dash crashes the game for rouge players, it would be cool to see the armor you are wearing on the character, I found gold pretty useless when i can craft everything i need, being able to rotate the camera would be incredibly helpful, and if there was a sprint option with like stamina bar it would help to get around instead of rolling everywhere Also add back the potion button and instead of 1-8 as hotkeys make it 1-9 . Other than that the combat is fun, i like the humor behind it, the leveling system gives tons of options for the way you want to play, and the smithing system is really easy but kind of overpowered.

Lots of content for a early access game and the devs are making frequent updates.\n\nThe game has really come along since the early beta builds and feels very complete at this point.\n\nThere are three "classes" each with two sub classes, so depending on how you want to play you can get some good replayability on it. Dungeons are mostly randomly generated so that is nice as well.\n\nFor items they have a very cool upgrade process so that sword you pick up can be continually improved and compared to ARPGs you don't have as much RNG in play for your gear. Items can also have sockets and the runes you socket can be very useful and powerful.\n\nA few quirks related to controls but nothing that you can't easily get over.\n\nPS: I suck at reviews, but this game is too much of a hidden gem to not review.","November 20, 2014","true","12.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JustinDP/recommended/249950/","JustinDP","JustinDP","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JustinDP/","383 products in account","Forge Quest was a game that caught my attention immediately with the visual style it works with, so when I caught the game on sale I was pretty happy to finally sit down and play it. What I ended up getting was both what I expected, and not entirely what I hoped for.\n\nThe best way I can describe the game is sort of a weird mixture of The Legend of Zelda, and Diablo. You'll run around swinging a sword at things, or shooting a bow all the while pushing blocks around to unlock a door. The story is very simplistic, and won't exactly grab your attention but it provides some amusing moments. Unfortunately the story is also quite short, and doesn't really feel like much is made in the way of progression along the way. True, there are skills you can unlock via skill trees when leveling up, but I rarely actually felt as if I was significantly more powerful after leveling. Perhaps you could argue that the enemies become bullet shields, but even the most basic of enemies eventually took quite a few hits after a while. You can get better equipment, but at the time I was playing there was a bug where most things would always drop as a level 1 item. This has since been fixed.\n\nThe game is randomly generated each time you start a new story (and you'll have to do it at least five times to unlock all the difficulty levels, if you have the patience for it. Ten times if you also want the achievements for hardcore mode) and this is both a positive and a negative. The good is that in a game with not a lot keeping you playing from a story standpoint the scenery is at least different. The bad is that the RNG is not always smart. An example is I ran into at least two instances where I went downstairs in a dungeon to find myself on a platform I couldn't get off of. Seemingly, this RNG is meant to make use of the leap attack ability, which is a talent point issued ability, but if you didn't happen to have that skill you're a bit screwed. Luckily, on both occassions I was able to merely glitch through the edge of the platform to get down to a different area to progress.  An additional RNG annoyance is the special enemies that can sometimes spawn. I had a couple of instances where I'd get a version of a monster that was immune to physical and magical attacks, whom also regenerated his health. Surely you're thinking I could just shoot him with a bow. Normally, you'd be right, but he also spawned adds at an alarmingly quick rate that made actually getting the arrow to hit the enemy I want rather difficult. This is in no way game breaking as these RNG enemies can be ignored at the loss of their exp and item drops, but still it wouldn't hurt the game to be a bit smarter in what can generate and what shouldn't mix when generating.\n\nThe game is unfortunately also a bit buggy, and prone to crashing. I had an issue where an entire dungeon would cause the game to crash to desktop every single time I attempted to pick a locked door. Thankfully, they have since patched that bug. It, however, wasn't the only issue I had with crashing. I've had it crash in mid battle. I've had the map glitch out on me randomly making it so I couldn't see where I was going, which usually resulted in a crash. The game still feels as if it should be in early access, despite the fact I believe it no longer is. I hate having to say negative things like that, as the developers are very active in the forums for the game and try to fix bugs as quickly as possible, but as of right now when I write this the game isn't fully THERE yet.\n\nIt may be before long, and I honestly hope it keeps evolving into something great. Sadly, right now I can't recommend it. The game is certainly playable, but it won't likely keep your interest past a first run of the story, and even if it can the bugs and odd RNG may cause you to shy away. Try the game if you think it looked interesting as I did, just be aware the product is a bit rough around the edges before you buy.","September 25, 2015","false","21.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

Delve deep into the randomly generated dungeons to battle monsters, find treasure and craft your equipment. Invite your friends to join your world and help you in your adventure.\n\nLong after great wars ravaged the land of Shmoop, a balance has been reached as both sides agreed to regulate all hero and villain related activities. This system flourishes as it creates the economic stability the land needed, and from it the great bureaucracy rose to rule over the land.\n\nAfter many years from the system's inception, you step onto the scene. A strapping young adventurer who, after being dropped off by your parents, set off to obtain your Hero license from the kingdom. Although eager to claim your title, your path is full of danger as you must first prove yourself in the dungeons below. You also soon learn that not everyone plays by the rules and what it means to become a hero is much more then just a signed paper.  - Highly Recommended!","June 9, 2015","true","1.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I have never truly been a fan of overhead dungeon crawlers, but this was the exception. Do I recommend this game? Absolutely.\n\nThe Pros:\n> Easy to play, hard to master\n> Very flexible class system\n> Interesting gear\n> Rewarding progression\n> Easy puzzles to start off the game\n> Punishing difficulties\n> Funny at times\n\nAlthough in most games - the term; 'easy to play, hard to master' almost always applies. But in this game, especially so. Learning how to play is fairly straight-forward, but learning how to efficiently play your character is another story. The class system is very unique in this game, as you are not restricted to playing one class, you can hybrid your class points into different class trees to reflect your preferred play-style. In addition - your class' starting gear does not reflect the gear they are restricted to. There are no gear restrictions (at the time of this review), but different kinds of gear reflects the statistics and bonuses it will give. So if you are playing a caster-esque character, but you want to be more built to take more damage, then the gear you will be looking for is Spellplate. Or if you're playing a ranged-damage character, you will be looking for Scalemail, and so on and so forth. Progression in this game is in the form of different quests that unlock different stages of the game, which inherently give you more gold that you can spend to upgrade your items (up to 10 additional levels past it's original level), make gear purchases, purchase potions, teleport scrolls, costumes, or combat-pets. The puzzles are pretty simplistic and don't take much time away from your gameplay outside of a handful later on that slowly begin to become more challenging and require some thought. The game progresses in difficulty, as one would expect, and the game becomes more challenging with unique boss fight mechanics that will keep (especially Hardcore characters) players on their toes. To wrap it all up, the game has a slight sense of humor added into it, which makes for a very enjoyable game.\n\nCons:\n> Very limited replayability\n> No way to restore a previously, or accidentally deleted character\n> No way to interchange player perspective (more of a personal opinion)\n> You must always replay the tutorial on a new character\n> Two gamemodes, story and endless (personal opinion there should be more to do, considering the story mode's replayability is relatively nonexistent)\n\nAll in all Forge Quest is an amazing game, I highly recommend it to anybody, as you can get a lot of enjoyment and fun out of it, however, like all games it has it's kinks, but - I would rate this game a 9/10.","January 14","true","16.1"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","5","10","0","0"

The randomized dungeons are a nice touch and the art style is cute, but combat is so frustrating at points that it makes me want to throw my laptop. Like I said, controls are so sticky that it's hard to get used to, and they're often slow to respond which makes combat even harder than it is (which is saying something, the combat can be nigh impossible at times with how damage is balanced currently.) With time I think this game could be good, and the devs seem active, so that's hopeful.\n\nIf you can get past the sluggish attack system, this is worth the $15. Power attacks are the only thing worth using in combat, but let your enemies gang up on you with so much ease that it can be frustrating, but that's the only big gripe I have at the moment.","May 31, 2015","true","4.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Gameplay is solid, I have yet to encounter any glitches. The game flow is simular to other dungeon crawlers - Dungeons of certain types, collect item from end boss, with nice lighthearted twists.\n\nForge Quest is an amusing game with plenty of references. While it is relaxing, it is also challenging when appropriate. The story is a little generic... In its own, humorously original way. In fact, the only negative that comes to mind is the limited soundtrack; often just a repeat depending on the type of area (dungeon, shop, town, outside, etc). Despite that, the music is not boring enough to want to turn it off.\n\nOverall, a great game that I will happily continue to play both casually and hardcore.\n\nJust beware....\n\nWhat came first?

Controlls were clearly designed with a controller in mind with no consideration for keyboard and mouse (for menus at least).\n\nCharacter building: Loot is generic varrying by one or two numbers at most with no variety of stats available or room for interesting builds. Builds are fairly linear. You go down one tree with little room for variation within a tree.

You won't get anywhere in this game without an organized team which is one of the many reasons why this game is so fun. Highly recommended.

The story line isn't finished, however me and my cousin managed to play 6 hours of Co-Op before reaching the end. Afterwhich we are replaying it with the same characters, but on a harder difficulty!\n\nPros\n\nThe gear management is nice and simple. It can, however, be quite difficult to reroll stats to what you want.\n\nThe class trees are simple and streamlined, however due to the lack of a hard level cap, you can spec into everything. Although we both reached level 25 before the end, which allowed us to get all the skill points we needed (There are 3 trees for each archtype (Warrior/Mage/Thief).\n\nCo-Op is nice. The EXP is shared, and you each get your own loot. I'm not 100% sure if the mobs scale at all, but it was still fun.\n\nThe mini-games are fun, but can get annoying after the 50th time your playing the resource minigame, but meh it was alright - something new to do. I feel like they should change the minigames difficulty, or at least its UI, depending on the area your in.\n\nCons\n\nA few bugs. I had a bug where i'd get teleported to a different area of the map when going through the transition screens (On Co-Op).\n\nThere were a few disconnections on either side during Co-Op. It wasn't that bad, however we'd lose items we had recently picked up. I'd say, within the 6 hours we played, we only had 3 D/Cs between us.\n\nThe range of monsters are limited. Apart from the bosses, which were AMAZING, the amount of mobs were quite limited. I would love to see more unique monsters with more unique attributes, and perhaps some new types.\n\n-----------------\n\nIt's cheap and amazing.

It's a pixel dungeon delver with some comedy thrown in. You make your own items and use them, though when you level you have to make new items to replace old, so no gear getting better with you.

Has that Zelda feel to it, probably because of all the chickens everywhere.  Also breaking pots for money and health.\n\nI do feel however that this game is lacking in content.  Although the game does randomly generate the stats the items have, there aren't much of a variety in the items.  That, and, the skill tree feels rather small, but that's just my personal opinion.  Gameplay wise, it's pretty solid.\n\nIt may not be the best roguelike that I've ever played, but definitely worth trying.  8/10","June 20, 2014","true","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story line isn't finished, however me and my cousin managed to play 6 hours of Co-Op before reaching the end. Afterwhich we are replaying it with the same characters, but on a harder difficulty!\n\nPros\n\nThe gear management is nice and simple. It can, however, be quite difficult to reroll stats to what you want.\n\nThe class trees are simple and streamlined, however due to the lack of a hard level cap, you can spec into everything. Although we both reached level 25 before the end, which allowed us to get all the skill points we needed (There are 3 trees for each archtype (Warrior/Mage/Thief).\n\nCo-Op is nice. The EXP is shared, and you each get your own loot. I'm not 100% sure if the mobs scale at all, but it was still fun.\n\nThe mini-games are fun, but can get annoying after the 50th time your playing the resource minigame, but meh it was alright - something new to do. I feel like they should change the minigames difficulty, or at least its UI, depending on the area your in.\n\nCons\n\nA few bugs. I had a bug where i'd get teleported to a different area of the map when going through the transition screens (On Co-Op).\n\nThere were a few disconnections on either side during Co-Op. It wasn't that bad, however we'd lose items we had recently picked up. I'd say, within the 6 hours we played, we only had 3 D/Cs between us.\n\nThe range of monsters are limited. Apart from the bosses, which were AMAZING, the amount of mobs were quite limited. I would love to see more unique monsters with more unique attributes, and perhaps some new types.\n\n-----------------\n\nIt's cheap and amazing.

With chickens... 10/10.  Would chicken fight again.\n\nSpoilers follow.  You ahve been warned.\n\nIf you've read my previous reviews, you'll see that I generally go by the "50 cent rule".  I want to enjoy a game for 50 cents per hour.  Thus, a $50 game should give me 100 hours of play time.\n\nThis game cost me $7.  It took exactly 14 hours to play.  This is a win.\n\nForge Quest is a dungeon crawler similar to Diablo, but with the "cutesy" voxel/8-bit looking graphics (just look at the screen shots).  At no point does the game try to take itself very seriously.  There are a few good tongue in cheek jokes, but I won't spoil those for you as the game is fairly short.\n\nIt starts with you as a new want-to-be hero who has to complete the 4 training dungeons to become one in the eyes of the law.  Each dungeon is only 4 "levels" deep, but the levels are fairly large, and the pacing is pretty decent.  New creatures/monsters/dungeon designs pop up just as you start to get bored with the old ones.  The algorithms for generating these dungeons randomly is pretty impressive, as each dungeon "type" is completely different from the previous.\n\nAfter completing the 4 dungeons, you'll fight the boss.  For me, the whole process took 14 hours, but I can say I enjoyed all 14 of them.  For the price, it was well worth it.\n\nMy only complaint would be that some of the abilities are not particularly well balanced.  As a mage, I was able to max out my "chicken attack" fairly early in the game (by the second dungeon).  After that, the whole game was just far too easy.  Spamming the chickens would wipe out ANY group of mobs.  Even the bosses stood no chance against my chickens' wrath.  It's also possible that there is a glitch with the chicken attack, as it seems like any attack done not using them had a CHANCE to drop some loot, but every mob killed by the chickens dropped TONS of loot.  Even summoned skeletons and baby spiders.  I had crazy powerful gear by the second dungeon because of this.\n\nI also ran into a glitched side "quest" that couldn't be completed, but it wasn't game breaking.\n\nThis feels a lot like a first attempt by an indy dev who now has an engine that they could do a LOT with, but this game itself only had 4 dungeons, and maybe 4 side "quests".  The bulk of my 14 hours was spent just grinding my way through the dungeons.\n\nFor $7, it's well worth it though, and you'll get quite a few chuckles on your way through.  For what the game consists of right now, that 14 hours is just about the right amount of time, and it's unlikely I'll be going for another play through, even with the randomized dungeons.\n\nI do hope to see more from this developer, though.  The game FEELS very good, and very solid.  The engine is a treat to look at, and the humor is enjoyable.  I hope to see a much larger, much more involved game created with this engine in the future.","December 29, 2015","true","14.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The best part about this game is the combat, and how simplistic the story is. The story its self is forgetable, but it's made up with excellent combat and randomized dungeons. I don't know why chickens are such a big thing in this game but I don't care, as long as I get to have 50 sets of armor on me at all times.\n\nSPEAKING OF THAT\n\nThis RPG is different from the others.

For an example, at the start of the game you will come across these Jelly Monsters, I forget their name... sorry. Anyways, no matter how hard you try it seems that they ALWAYS hit you, taking about 5 HP in the process (And when you start out you have low HP).\n\nThe Bats can go drown in a cess pool, nobody needs those, ever.","June 1, 2015","true","25.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is great and unique. I liked how they made it to where you can summon chickens to kill your foes.\n\nNow aside from all this, there are a couple of bugs I thought I would mention.\n-Ancient turrets cause no damage\n-Using certain skills will cause the graphics to break. This later causes your game to crash.\n-Put a buff on the King Frost Wolves healing howl. If they are in a group it is literally impossible to kill them, and you can't say I have to kill them one at a time when they are all standing next to each other in their respective spawns.\n-The alchemy bomb stays in place when you throw it at a higher elevation.\n-Some locked doors were locked twice. Don't know if that was intentional.\n\nThat's all I've really noticed, but these glitches didn't get in the way of the game. As far as the bosses in the game you should make them a bit harder to kill. Maybe give them some resistances to the weapon type you are using when you are playing solo, or a number of resistances when with friends. They drop too quickly for them to be bosses, but more like monster fodder.\n\nI'm guessing from a warlock/mage standpoint that there are 4 different types of weapons for each class. That's cool and all, but you could add an alternate attack besides a charge attack with things such as the fireball staff or the spellbook. The combat does get a little repetitive with only a combo from each sword weapon, and the same projectiles from the said magic weapons. The skills do not make up for this because some of them such as the vine spell where you can trap your foes is pointless to even use because you can kill most enemies in seconds. There's also the skills that are so overpowered such as the meteor storm that make the game easier than it needs to be, and since most shields will regenerate mana/rage the skill can be used over and over.\n\nAnother thing I noticed was how easy it was to get gold in the game. In the first dungeon I got a ton of greed runes with have 50% gold find. When you combine tons of these gold becomes very disposable. You could make these runes a bit more rare, a bit less effective, or you can make it harder for these to be leveled. The loot system is a little weird too. It's randomized to where you can get magenta based loot from regular enemies, but when you go up to a chest you get a bunch of garbage. So it's not at all rewarding even if you do get rare equipment such as this. It literally doesn't matter what rarity they are you can use anything and everything to beat this game.\n\nThat's all I can think to say about this game. I recommend this game if you like dungeon crawlers. This is sort of like Diablo 3 as far as the difficulty part is concerned.","June 3, 2015","true","11.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
