C. Escher's nightmares.  Normally that would be a bad thing, but in this case, it's very good.  The Bridge is a puzzle game with a simple premise: Reach the exit door.  Your only tool is control over the direction of gravity though you can only change its direction slowly.  You will need to avoid deadly obstacles and obtain keys to unlock doors in order to escape.\n\nWhile a few of the levels require frustrating levels of repetition and precision in order to reach your goal, most of them are very enjoyable.  In total there are 24 puzzles and 24 mirror versions which add some elements of difficulty in addition to being reversed.  Strangely I found the mirror versions of some of the hardest levels easier than their normal counterparts.  Even if you aren't into puzzle games, the Escher-like artwork is worth marveling at.\n\nOne thing I found missing in the game is music.  It seems like a greatly missed opportunity for a unique and strange soundtrack to match the level design.  There is some music in the game but it plays rarely and is very quiet.\n\nThe other major weakness I found is probably not something many players will encounter:  The collectibles.  Some are absurdly difficult to find, and one even requires you doing something that the game constantly tells you doesn't work for the entire game.  When you do locate them all, the reward is extremely anticlimactic.  It's annoying but like I said, the majority of players probably won't bother with the collectibles and those that do will most likely use guides so they don't go insane trying to find them all.\n\nAs a fan of puzzle games, I greatly enjoyed The Bridge.  You will too!","May 24, 2014","true","6.5"," 135 of 142 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","135","142","0","0"

Just in case there's anyone else sitting on the fence about this, I thought I should add a note of caution. This is essentially a physics puzzler, which is ostensibly a genre I enjoy. In this case however, I think the the execution fails to live up to the ideas. For me, most of the challenge in the game came not through reasoning through the puzzles (though there were moments), but in wrestling with object momentum that frequently ended up being more frustrating than satisfying. At the sale price of $1 it's hard to argue that it's a waste of money. But I feel that personally for me it ended up being a waste of time. And that's something a low price does nothing to help. I see many good things written elsewhere about this game, so I may be in a minority in feeling this way, but I can't help but feel that there are far better puzzle games out there, despite the compelling visual style that I still find appeals to me even though it also triggers memories of annoying level design.","August 25, 2014","false","5.0"," 228 of 312 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","228","312","0","13"

This game forces the player to view the game in different ways. The mind-bending puzzles has the player's reevaluate the preconceptions they've had on physics and perspective of the world.\n\n"It is Isaac Newton meets M.C. Escher."\n\nThe puzzles consist of one or many intricate architectures where the player has to manipulate gravity to complete the levels. The levels of the puzzles gradually increase, leaving a sense of accomplishment after completing them. The beginning puzzles start out extremely easy, letting the player finish in a minute or two, but the puzzles towards the end can leave a player stump for days unless they look up a guide or have someone else look at the puzzle (a different set of eyes can look at the puzzle at a different angle).\n\nNot only is The Bridge a highly intellectual game, the artwork is something to behold. Many art enthusiasts would enjoy the game, simply for the art. The art style is hand drawn black-and-white lithograph. At first glance, the art did not appeal to me, but after completing the game 100%, I saw how beautiful something so simple can be.\n\nWith all that said, I dare you, reader, to complete this game 100%.

Both are certainly very solid: Mind-bending puzzles in a graphite or charcoal sketch style inspired by the works of M.C. Escher. Puzzles work by rotating the level and moving your character, and solutions often require managing gravities that work in several different directions within the same level. There's little not to love with that description, and that is ultimately what sold me on the game.\n\nWhat ultimately comes out of that concept, however, is little beyond an exercise in tedium. There are several details in the game's execution that leave more to be desired. (Full disclosure: I reached about halfway through Chapter 4 before realizing that I was not enjoying myself in the slightest.) First, and most noticeably, is the ambling pace of both the character's movement and that of the level rotation. Many times, I found myself just idly holding a direction for several seconds, waiting for the level to reach the desired orientation while my character impotently shuffled about trying to gain footing on the shifting ground. Or I'd end up dragging my feet along a "twisting" path -- which usually turns out to be ultimately linear -- to my destination, long after having worked out the solution. I appreciate a good, thoughtfully paced puzzle experience, but perhaps the motion of the level and character should actually match that speed of thought.\n\nPerhaps more egregious, though, is that the puzzles, while sometimes fairly challenging, never actually feel satisfying to solve. Unlike other more clever puzzle platformers, there were never any "Oh, yeah! THAT'S how I'll do it!" moments while playing The Bridge. Everything seemed to just kind of putt along, and reaching a solution seemed like a given more than an actual achievement. Perhaps it gets more interesting after Chapter 4, but that's the point that I gave up.\n\nOther objections could be made of how highly derivative -- downright imitative -- the game is of a certain other time-bending puzzle platformer. One could suggest that shoehorned time reversal mechanic adds absolutely nothing to the game experience other than harking to another better game. Arguments could be made that the narrative and level structures are almost identical to that one game with the timey wimey stuff. One could do all that, if one wasn't enjoying playing Braid so much more.\n\nOverall, I wouldn't personally recommend The Bridge, unless you picked it up on sale and don't mind tediously trudging through admittedly very competently illustrated puzzles for a few hours. I commend the developers and wish them the best for their future games, but hopefully next time they won't try to make Braid 2: The Rebraidening.","December 24, 2013","false","1.6"," 67 of 84 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","67","84","0","0"

By the end of the game, you really do deserve a medal, is the kind of accomplishment I'm talking about.\n\nThe game consists of getting the unnamed, old chap through to the exit door in each level, to advance. The game's puzzles, inspired by the Dutch artist, M. C. Escher, who plays a massive aspect in this game, as the world and its environment is shown in grayscale with beautifully hand-drawn illustrations. Obstacles such as voids, which can suck you and other objects into a swirly mess, ''Menace Balls'' that can roll around the puzzle world and flatten you to death. Even steep cliffs that could slip you off the world and fall to your death. With all these dangers aside, you can use this to your advantage by rotating the maze world around you as well as reversing the flow of time, to cheat your demise. Along with controlling the core of elemental physics and gravitational pulls, Isaac Newton, eat your heart out.\n\nI personally love the dark and rather gothic visual world this game sinks its teeth into. The world is truly a marvel to behold, not only for its diverse, colourless design, but for its ingenuity and artistic flare. You could literally stand there in a level, and just analyse every single little detail that had been hand-drawn and just get lost in the rich, beautiful and elegant designs. It doesn't just go for the levels, even the real world locations makes me feel as if I was reading a gothic child's book, what with its vague nostalgic environments and architecture.\n\nThe only problem I have with this game is that it's incredibly short, when counting it has only 4 chapters, with only 6 puzzles each. But, with this game's cryptic puzzling, it will keep you stumped out of ideas, as you overcomplicate things and try to get things in the right motion. I'm guilty to say that I've got stuck on one tiny puzzle that left me clueless for over half an hour. Other than that, the controls can be a little iffy here and there, as the game only allows firm movements set in the right motion and time.\n\nDefinitely a recommendation from me, if you're the brainy independent-type. And yes, I'm not that independent, as I did use a walkthrough guide for this game. Ruined the experience, I know, but definitely pick up this game and don't look for outside help as it does ruin it!","September 24, 2014","true","2.8"," 40 of 45 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","40","45","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/204240/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Largely inspired by the abstract paintings of M.C. Escher, The Bridge is an equally abstract puzzle games which merges gorgeous artwork with an almost Marble Madness-esque tilt mechanic to create an original, evocative experience. It asks you to set aside traditional logic, and adopt a new mindset in a world created on and by its own unique rules, which prove harder to adopt to than you might think.\n\nThe constant flux of gravity is at the center of every puzzle, requiring you to rotate the entire level in order to make your way to the exit. New mechanics such as items which exist in opposition of your own gravity, ones which can only be used by inverting yourself, and other various means to hinder your progress, are introduced as you progress but the basic foundation that up and down are perhaps one and the same holds the game together as things become more and more esoteric in design. It's a very thoughtful game, even in terms of the controls that although sluggish at first, become an integral part of the contemplative pacing once you've adjusted to the relatively slow speed at which everything moves.\n\nUnderneath the puzzles is a story largely open to interpretation. There are hints at what the protagonist, a nameless but brilliant mathematician was attempting, but right up to the end pieces are purposely left out so as to let your come to your own conclusions. While this works fantastically for the narrative, when it begins to bleed into the gameplay the experience becomes slightly too obtuse and the end goal less and less focused. This is most apparent in the later stages where the difficulty is highest, but the rules as to how everything works still obnoxiously unclear. Even having completed them, I couldn't explain to you how many of the mechanics work, which I feel for the style of game is a rather big problem. Solving a puzzle should be something I can figure out on my own, not a random series of events that somehow allows me to arrive at the same conclusion, and yet this is exactly what happened much of the time.\n\nDespite the occasional frustration I had with the level designs, my predominant experience was one of continual wonder and curiosity as I made my way through the gorgeously drawn environments, accompanied by unexpectedly grand sound design and a reposed score that creates the feeling that something is amiss without the need for lengthy cutscneses or drawn out dialog.\n\nIt's an exceptionally artistic journey, but a short one. I completed the game in just under two and a half hours, and while this does unlock mirrored versions of every level (a minor switch that adds an unexpectedly hefty challenge), I personally didn't feel compelled to complete them. Regardless, if you were intrigued by the art design I wouldn't hesitate to pick this up. While it definitely seemed to lack...something....the end result is still a rewarding and highly intriguing game that kept me engaged and left many puzzles wonderfully open to ponder after I put it down. Though one can only wonder what he would think of such an unusual offspring of his artwork, I feel if Escher was alive today he'd be as impressed as I am with Ty Taylor and Mario Castañeda's strange creation, which might ironically get him some new fans of his own.\n","December 6, 2013","true","2.5"," 44 of 55 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","44","55","0","0"

Our hero--bearded, bespectacled, and dressed in a tweed coat--may fit the classic stereotype of a university professor, but everyone from students to deans will recognize his struggles. We find him alone in a black and white world that reflects the graceful simplicity of pure logic, and we watch him discard unsatisfactory ideas and leave eraser smudges as a reminder of his mistakes. It's a lonely world, fraught with many moments of frustration and suffering from occasional tedium, but every now and then it rewards you with flashes of insight that make the whole endeavor worthwhile.Every puzzle in The Bridge gives you the simple goal of walking through a door. A constant juggle of physics, gravity, and perspective complicates this structure, however, and the game wastes little time in delivering delightful challenges.This progression happens quickly, or rather, it does if you're mentally agile enough to get past the puzzles in a timely manner. Indeed, The Bridge is a short game if you judge it by its 24 short levels. The surrounding world is very alluring. The Bridge's aesthetic draws heavily on the perspective-bending work of M.C. Escher, and much like his art, each level unfolds in grayscale hues that evoke penciled illustrations.What's most refreshing, however, is the game's dedication to minimalism. For most of The Bridge, it's just you and the game, and no health bars or item counters mar that serenity.There's an intriguing story here, too, but piecing it together requires some of the same brainwork you apply to the puzzles. The narrative is not obvious, but it makes itself known in the details.Although rage-inducing difficulty spikes exist, The Bridge generally offers a middle path that should appeal both to newcomers and to expert puzzle solvers.","September 19, 2014","true","13.5"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","21","25","0","0"

It's easy to jump into and get the hang of, and it does a good job of presenting new mechanics to the gameplay to keep things fresh as you progress.  There is an exceptional job done in finding a way to create challenging, thought-provoking puzzles without being overly frustrating.\n\nThe art isn't mind-blowing but it fits the atmosphere of the game very well.  The controls feel natural from the start, and that's important because there is a small amount of platforming required for some of the puzzles. Luckily it is nothing too over-the-top that it ruins the game for those who are trying to enjoy it as a puzzle game and aren't good at platformers. I should note, though, that I was using a controller; which I felt was more comfortable than the keyboard.\n\nAnd one cool addition is the time-warp feature. As with other games where time manipulation is a feature, it can really go a long way to ensure the game doesn’t become too tedious. If you make a mistake during a level you can rewind a few seconds without having to start all over.\n\nAll in all, I think The Bridge does a good job delivering what it intends to.  I believe a good puzzle game these days needs to find a way to be innovative and challenging without being frustrating and redundant, and this game delivers in that regard.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","August 25, 2014","true","6.3"," 22 of 27 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","22","27","0","0"

For an indie game the developers should be proud of what they've accomplished. If there were a somewhere-between-thumbs-up-and-thumbs-down button this is the game I would most want to use it for.\n\nI leaned on the side of not recommending it though, for several reasons. This game is inevitably compared to Braid because it has an artsy style, time manipulation, and puzzles. But it's nowhere near the level of those other puzzle games I love, including Braid or Limbo or even Master Reboot. The reason is mostly depth and story. There simply isn't that much here. And what does exist is far too obscure and limited to be moving.\n\nBeyond that, the puzzles range from straightforward to extremely frustrasting. The difficulty never really flattened out: I either had a level figured out in the first minute, or could stare at it forever with limited success. A few puzzles required some split second timing, which given the controls and precision in this game (they're laggy and your character can't move fast at all) made them very annoying. It was essentially just repeat forever until you happen to squeeze by.\n\nThe black and white art might have actually hurt the game more than helped, as it could be hard to tell the difference between some things that were only separated by shades of gray. As for the music, I hardly noticed it, so it didn't leave much of an impact.\n\nMy final complaint is performance. This is a 2D game with limited effects, but even on an absurdly powerful machine it got extremely choppy at points. It was somewhere down near 1 frame per 2 seconds while I was in freefall. That's just not acceptable, even for an indie game.\n\nSo overall if you're itching for a puzzle game and don't mind the lack of story, and can look past the game's other flaws, then you can pick up The Bridge and it will give you what you want for a few hours. But personally, I won't be coming back to it any time soon.","December 29, 2014","false","10.6"," 34 of 51 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","34","51","0","0"

The difficulty rating will surely make it memorable for those who manage to somehow reach its end.\n\nLong version:Many things have been said about the Bridge. About the innovation of using puzzles based on impossible geometry (like the Penrose triangle). About the creativity of the hand-drawn black and white visual style. About the eerie, surreal story.\n\nAll of it is true. And all of it is (geatly) exaggerated.\n\nFirst and foremost: the Bridge is nothing more than a set of rotation puzzles with good friction and momentum physics. Some levels are good. Some require a lot of tiresome fidgeting around to find that roughly 0.01° window to pull off the solution.\nDon’t get me wrong: the puzzle design is great. It is also a little sadistic, especially in the second half of the game. This makes you to stop and think about the core of the problem instead of sheer trial and error, so it achieves that many other puzzle games could not.\n\nNext to the difficulty, the most memorable feature of the Bridge is the visual style, which reminds us to the black & white underground obscure graphic novels from the late seventies. Strange as it may sound, but this surreal imagery really fits a logic-based puzzle game.\nThis warped mindset carries itself through the story, or more precisely the very conscious choice of not having any form of story whatsoever. It is just a collection of surrealistic monologues that try to make the player think deeper things into the levels than what they really are: a set of good rotational puzzles with really high difficulty.","September 21, 2015","true","7.4"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","16","20","0","0"

Escher painting. 11/10 life perspective changing.\n\nIf you like puzzle platformers, tilting the game world around, and M.C. Escher artstyle, then you will enjoy this game.\n\nThe aesthetics are very nice - everything is hand-drawn in black-and-white. The details in the scenery are good and varied enough to keep things interesting. The music is decent, but I quickly muted it in favor of my own.\n\nControls are simple and easy to learn - much of your playthrough will involve rotating the game world left or right. There is a brief tutorial and large tip popups are provided when necessary (like when you die). The learning curve is minimal to moderate depending on your experience with platform puzzlers. I found most of the level solutions to be fairly intuitive and solvable through a bit of trial-and-error.\n\nGameplay involves you trying to reach a door to the next level. To get there, you will have to navigate through the level, most likely rotating the world in different ways to assist you. The door may sometimes be locked, forcing you to first obtain a key. As you progress through the game, new elements are added to keep you on your toes. Without wanting to spoil any surprises, some of the first additions include  a ball that instantly kills you on touch and a vortex that will keep anything that touches it suspended . You have the ability to reverse time as far back as you wish to correct any mistakes. Some levels require a light touch - you may have to slowly rotate the world to get things where you need them to be.\n\nInspired by M.C. Escher's artstyle, physically-impossible level layouts require a lot of world manipulation in order to navigate to the exit. For example, you may have to do a complete 360 of the world to manoeuvre your character through several flights of stairs/ledges. The store page screenshots can give you good indications of what type of levels to expect.\n\nOverall, the game is a fantastic puzzle platformer with a nice mechanic and a great artstyle. If you are interested in the genre, then definitely check it out.\n\nRecommend!\n\nCheers,\nDJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews\n","April 30, 2015","true","2.4"," 17 of 23 people (74%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","74","17","23","6","2"

As the games goes on more mechanics are added: locks, fast moving boulders, and so on. After the first play though you could always challenge yourself in the mirrored world (which is more than just inversions) or try to find all the wisps.\n\nThe art and animation are praiseworthy. Impossible architecture fills out the hand-drawn world. The M.C. Esher style is well done and makes this game stand out. Though I enjoyed the art, at times I felt like Air Force academies could use this game to train pilots.\n\nIn many ways this game is companion to Braid. Where Braid revolved around the concept of freedom in gameplay (running around and messing with time), while The Bridge seems to deal with restraint (physically limited and trapped in gravity). Braid's vivid water-colors also act as a counterpoint to The Bridge's hand drawn black and white style. Though I am simplifying, these differences (and many more) are interesting to note and for that I think the Bride deserves more attentino.\n\nThere is a lot of depth to this game (upon close inspection) and it is brimming with challenge.

Escher" completely literally and the result is as perplexing as it sounds. Natural gravity is disregarded and surfaces twist to bend back onto themselves. However, this is still a physics puzzle game and so paths and solutions have to be plotted out in a place where up and down are no longer locked in a single position. The black and white sketched out world suits this sort of experimental thinking and the dawdling, clumsy intellectual of an avatar does as well. But those same qualities - that make sense as a matter of theme - slow down trial and error investigation causing the game itself to become tedious and frustrating at times. Aggravating as it can be sometimes waiting for a puzzle to finish turning or the protagonist to get from one place to another, finding the solution and hearing that door creak open is always rewarding. This quality shines especially bright at the halfway mark, when the game revisits all the previous levels as mirrored versions of themselves. Along with flipping the level itself, many new obstacles are added, including a brand new timing element in some sections. Surprisingly, these levels feel only vaguely familiar instead of the lazy rehashes that tactic would expectantly yield. It goes to show how well-crafted the original puzzle worlds were and how great each individual, independent piece is.\nIt's a shame then, that the story doesn't fit together as neatly. It's only told through snippets or thought fragments, leaving most to the imagination. Due to how little material there is to work with, it's difficult to tell if there is a deep, compelling narrative to piece together or if it's positioned as deliberately obtuse in order to hide the fact that the game has nothing to say. The worst thing about it, or the best depending on your perspective, is that I can't seem to stop myself from coming back to it over and over again.","February 14","true","10.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

It is not an absent minded puzzler, you really have to focus if you want to get through all the levels and enjoy it. Slow controls and giving you little introduction to the various mechanics are the game's way of trying to tell you that you should sit back and plan what you are about to do, rather than dicking about until something seems to click (Which is permitted by many games, and therefore is tempting, but will ultimately be frustrating and unsatisfying in this one). Like the mathematics this game's story hints at, if you do not pay attention you'll miss something, and it only takes missing one thing to be stumped completely.

It's like a terrifyingly beautiful nightmare. It is captivating. I love the art, the originality, and the atmosphere. But you still have this feeling of something being off. The game sucks you in and leaves you wondering what will happen to you once you've been taken. It really is just like those dreams where everything is perfectly fine, except for an uneasy feeling, you don't know what is giving you that feeling, maybe it's those boots that are laying on their side, or the absence of lint on your clothes, you don't know, but you can tell something is wrong. If you are expecting a monster or someone with a chainsaw popping up like it's a B horror flick, you won't find that here. But you will remain uneasy throughout.\n\nI recommend this game 100%, and I'm giving it a 10/10. The experience you get from playing this game is unlike any other I've played in the past. It's very unique, it has elements I've seen in other games, rotating the map, manipulating gravity, but the ingenuity with which it was applied is unparalleled. But be warned, this game will haunt you like few other games have.","September 4, 2014","true","3.5"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","1"

There are a few stars and The Bridge is trying hard to be one of those. Unfortunately it's simply noticeable and not remarkable. The non-reality space that makes up the core of the puzzles is relatively unique and challenging but not impossible. The art style is very striking, sort of a pencil sketch in motion, but outside of that it's pretty standard fair. You rotate your view, jump and navigate hazards, move giant boulders using physics, switch between dimensions, and get the story in pieces outside of the actual gameplay.\nAt the end of the day its definitely a cut above average but not in the upper echelon.

It is divided into 48 levels with the first half requiring minimal use of logic and feeling like somewhat of a pushover; fortunately, this is mostly remedied in the second half—a mirrored version of the first with additional obstacles thrown in and where a greater number of puzzles actually make you think.\n\nThe puzzles start off easily enough, with simple gravity manipulation and key collection, then introduce additional elements consistently: deadly balls which roll as you rotate the environment and can adhere to their own laws of gravity; points which invert gravity and shift you between black and white dimensions where you may only interact with objects matching your current color; vortexes which suck anything near them into place and hold them there until deactivated; mirror images of yourself which require entering multiple doors or picking up multiple keys simultaneously to progress; and gravity curtains, where you may remain stationary while rotating the world to work objects into their desired positions relative to your own.\n\nThe Bridge features Steam achievements and some well-hidden collectibles to find.  Gamepad is natively supported and the controls are very simple, consisting of walking, rotating the environment clockwise or counter-clockwise, and rewinding time when you make a mistake.  It feels very reminiscent of Braid at times, but the puzzles aren’t as satisfying or clever as those in Braid and the overall difficulty curve should have been based on the second half of the game. Anyone who stops before the mirrored world is doing themselves a disservice and, if I had to judge the game based on the first 24 levels alone, I would have to judge it much more harshly. As a whole, The Bridge manages to be a worthwhile puzzle game and to feel very solid despite being made by two people.","May 21, 2013","true","10.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","3"

Many puzzles are very simple while others require some thought to figure out, and I enjoyed both.  Once you complete the game on normal mode, the game sends you into a mirrored world, which sends you through more difficult (usually) versions of each level.  I have 2 big problems with the game though.\n\n1. There's really not much in the way of a story, interesting characters, or anything else to give you some motivation to get through these puzzles.  If you're looking for something to keep you hooked other than just puzzles, don't get this.\n\n2. Some of these puzzles aren't so much puzzles as they are trial and error until you get it right.  There were several boards where I had to finagle the inversions and flipping of the level extremely precisely to be able to get into the exit.  1 or 2 of the boards had switches that you had to hit to get into the exit and I managed to slip in during the .1-.25 seconds that I managed to land the ball on the switch before it could roll off.  I made it all the way to inverted 4-6 (Last level in the game) before I just grew frustrated with the level and looked up how to complete it.\n\nCould be fun if you like puzzle games, but there are much better ones out there.

The art style is definitely what will grab your attention the most; every single character model and backdrop is very carefully crafted in a greyscale, architecture like style, and every bit of the scenery has something interesting to look at. The gameplay is also very impressive for what it has presented, and each level has its own unique concept... that is until you get to the mirrored world, which is just the same design as the previous levels only in reverse and with a few extra obstacles thrown in. To be honest if there were no more ideas for levels then the game should have ended after the first 4 worlds. But that's really my only complaint and no where near hindered my enjoyment.\n\nOverall this is a fantastic game that any puzzle enthusiast and art lover will enjoy.","December 3, 2015","true","8.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Besides basic movement, you can tilt the levels clockwise or anticlockwise, and are also able to reverse time. Unlike Braid however, reversing time isn't used for puzzles, only to reverse a game over. The tilting can also get annoying at times, feeling more like a precision game then a puzzle game at time.\n\nNevertheless, the game does try to spice the gameplay up by adding new rules as you progress (which isn't too much, only 4 worlds and 4 mirrored but a lot harder worlds) and with a very compelling artstyle. It can really make your head spin how you character manages to traverse the levels in rather impossible forms.\n\nIs it worth full price? Maybe. But if it's on sale and you're a tiny bit interested in either platforms, puzzles or rather abstract looking games, it'll definetely be worth your time.","August 26, 2014","true","2.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

However, for the most part the pace of the game was slow, repetitive, and just full of "try randomly untill you somehow get it right." It had a lot of potential and did come half way through but that's just another way of saying it fell short. An average player will complete this game with all achievements in 4 to 7 hours, which is decent for the price tag.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/recommended/204240/","Maxmetpt","Maxmetpt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/","704 products in account","The Bridge is another entry in the physics puzzle-platformer genre, and a quite ambitious entry at that!\nIt focuses on its one main mechanic, which is simply flipping the world, and its gravity with it. However, the levels are designed from the ground up to support it with a M. C. Escher-esque perspective, leading to some twisted and creative levels.\n\nThe game has 2 main sets, the second of which is a rework of the previous levels, with added elements that you learned to overcome in the first set. It seems a bit like an extended tutorial, as half of each chapter is about exposing a mechanic to the player, not being too challenging. The puzzles featured here are, in my opinion, better designed, and not difficult to actually finish once you know the solution.\nThe second, however, has a more physics-driven design, very unlike the first. This might leave you hanging a bit in the first few levels, but it's not as hard as it seemed after you realize that you actually do have to be more meticulous with the physics.\n\nIt also features a few secret Wisps (which help you interpret the story) and Achievements that can be frustrating to do if you're not using a guide, or maybe discussing clues with your friends. But none of it is mandatory, so it's a fair addition to the game.\n\n\nThe artstyle of the game is most likely its main draw. It's certainly very unique and it manages to merge its visual level design with the gameplay mechanics seamlessly.\nIf you're familiar with Escher's work, you'll certainly see where the inspiration came from! If you're not (like I was) this is certainly an opportunity to look into it, if you find this game's aesthetic interesting at all. It's certainly a great selling point, and it's always great when games manage to teach you something as subtly as The Bridge did.\n\nThe music, on the other hand, was disappointing to me. While the game is full of twisted perspectives and characters who are near madness, the music felt a bit underwhelming as a direct result. It's not bad, by any means. It's fairly minimalistic, with a few dissonant aspects to it (which I like), but I feel like the game would benefit more from something darker and more disturbing.\nWith that said, it still did its job, and added to the atmosphere.\n\n\nThe game mechanics all come down to rotating the world around you. Your goal is to reach a door, that is often locked. It can be unlocked by picking up a key, or activating a switch with one (or more) boulder(s). The objects in the levels are also subjected to gravity, however, not necessarily the same as yours. And it's basically about figuring out which path will lead a certain object where it needs to go, in often mind-bending and maze-like levels.\nThere are vortices (deactivated by a pressure plate), a curtain that negates gravity (so that you can rotate freely and change only the other objects' gravity), etc.\n\n...I almost forgot! There's also a rewind mechanic. And, of course, it made some people say the game tried to rip Braid off. Well... no. Not at all. Braid used time as its mechanic, and something needed to finish the puzzles. In The Bridge, it merely exists as a handy tool to let you undo mistakes without replaying the levels from the start.\n\nThe game has 4 chapters, each with 6 levels (and then there are an equal number of mirrored levels, which are harder and provide more plot elements -- don't consider the game finished without these!). Usually, the first 2-3 levels are about introducing a new mechanic to you, and the other 3 will use them in different ways, providing more challenging puzzles.\nI'll admit that a few levels (especially later ones) proved to be a bit difficult. A problem I've had with it, is that it's very hard to actually visualize the solution to the puzzles. It came down to identifying different possible paths, and trying them out until I was close enough to the solution to be able to do the rest easily. I believe this is inherent to the level design, as everything is almost made to trick your eyes, making it a real pain to predict where each path will take you. Adding the fact that you're constantly rotating, which confuses you even more (and may provoke motion sickness, so beware!).\nAs I said, the later ones are more physics driven, and can be substantially harder if you're not used to it.\n\nAll in all, I actually felt somewhat rewarded for finishing it all without the use of a guide (except for the wisps). Some levels took me longer than I expected, but never being too frustrating.\nAnd it was unique, so you should definitely give it a go, if you're into the genre. If you're not, it's probably not your best choice to start out, as there are other games which teach the player its tought-patterns better than The Bridge did (at least for me).\n\n\nTo end it, I just want to make a comment on the story and characters. At the end of each chapter, you'll get a sentence or two to give you a better idea of what's going on. Basically, it's a story about Escher and Newton working together. Escher, an almost mad artist, constantly trying to overcome reality, and Newton, a genius physicist, both using mathematics in unconventional ways.\nIt touches on finally finding someone as absurd as him, sharing interests, and then pursuing the impossible.\nIt's all very open to interpretation, of course, but I really liked the way it has been done. The achievements also add a bit to this, specifically the names of the ones you get from simply finishing a chapter (Thinker, Academic, Scholar, Challenger, Heretic, Outcast, Hermit, Genius)... It's definitely not the focus of a game, but I always think it's good when developers spread various elements across the game (not just in the levels, or direct exposition, but on little things like this).\n\n\n\nIf you haven't figured it out yet, I definitely recommend this game to fans of the genre. How it bridges (heh) the visual and mechanical elements of level design is awesome, and it then coats it with interesting characters and themes that should make the player interested in knowing a bit more about what it's all about.\nI've certainly enjoyed it more than I expected, and makes me look forward to the developers' next games!","September 12, 2014","true","9.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is especially true with some of the achievements and mirror levels.\n\nThat said, nothing in the game ever feels impossible.\n\nMy one gripe is the addition of hidden collectables. They are few in number, most of them aren't hard to pick up, and the game actually does have hints to find them. I'm just not a fan as they force you to think in a way disconnected from the rest of the game to interpret the hints. Luckily, there are concise guides on Steam for those (like me) without the patience for a puzzle in a puzzle.","March 25, 2015","true","10.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This game is simple yet highly complex and can give you many hours of gameplay if you go after all the achievements. What I liked most about this game was the difficulty curve. Most puzzle games I've played are ridiculously easy and don't pull you in. The Bridge starts off this way but provides some genuinely challenging sections as you progress. The mechanics in this game are interesting enough that even non puzzle game fans would probably enjoy this. Not a strong story line and the character doesn't pull you in as much as other puzzle games on this level (like Machinarium) but still definitely worth playing.

Arrow keys are pretty much all you need.  Don't let that fool you though; The Bridge is as difficult as it is entertaining.\n\nThe levels look like they were taken out of an MC Escher sketch book.  You spend a lot of time spinning the world around and manipulating the gravity in order to get through each puzzle.  There are times when your eyes will decieve you, as you get lost in the beautiful sketches that are each level.\n\nThis is one of those games that you have to try.

Esher and solving perceptual puzzles, this indie game is just your cup of tea.  The Bridge may use some of the tired old devices of gaming like doors for levels and the like, but still manages to feel fresh due to the captivating artwork and progressive difficulty of the puzzles that you encounter at each step along the way.  It is a great casual game to have in your game portfolio for those times when you want to take a break from serious, intense games.\n\nThe game works flawlessly with an Xbox 360 controller and the controls are elegantly simple.  Make a wrong move and kill your character - no problem.  You just hit the B button to go backward in your gameplay to a safe spot of your choosing and start trying to solve the puzzle again.  Bad solutions that kill the character show up on the screen as faint images of the character where he died so that you can remember where you got into trouble as you shift the mobius board left, right and around to use game physics to help your character through the puzzle.\n\nThe detail in the drawings and the background ambient music make it a pleasure to explore each new scene and find a way to the next scene in each chapter.\n\nAnd of course there are trading cards and some nifty backgrounds that look great on a player's profile.\n\n","December 8, 2013","true","5.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The controls are very simple, but the puzzles get quite tricky.\n\nOn a gamepad, the left stick controls your character while the triggers rotate the world. That combines with physics and perspective tricks to make for some good challenges. You may need to rotate a level enough to get around to one side, but while making sure a key doesn't fall off of the level from its precarious perch.\n\nThe controls for the character feel very slow, which I would usually hate, but I think that the ability to rewind when experimenting made up for the sluggish controls.\n\nI thought that the difficulty level personally was a really satisfying curve that kept each puzzle feeling like an accomplishment without getting too hard...until the last level; I had to actually look up that single solution.

I consider myself a good puzzler and I score high in spatial orientation tests. Still, this game was too hard for me. I like puzzles that are more elegant and requires more thinking than trial and error, so the experience wasn't all that great for me. Don't be overconfident in your skills--unless you're really good or willing to use walkthroughs (which I did a few times, especially later in the game), you're probably just gonna get frustrated. So I can't really recommend it (and I actually did at first, because I really wanted to), unless you're that specific player. If you are, go for it, it's a work of art.\n\nPros:\nBeautifully drawn 2D graphics inspired by Escher's work\nAwesome BGM\n48 levels, if I counted right\nVery challenging levels should please hardcore puzzlers\nI could still enjoy it even if I had to use the walkthrough quite a few times\nCons:\nProbably way too hard for most players\nRequires a lot of trial and error and ridiculous precision, which in my opinion is (almost?) never good in a puzzle game\nTerrible difficulty curve... you get hard levels, then easier, then even harder, then easier again and so on\nI felt dizzy playing this game after constantly turning the screen around\nMovement is really slow, to the point of being annoying sometimes\nIt should be a bit easier moving between level hubs after you unlock them\nStory didn't make any sense to me... I know there was one, but I have no clue what it was about\nHints for Collector achievement are insanely hard if you don't look elsewhere\nBought on / for: Steam Store for R$ 1,99 (US$ 0.87). Money-wise, it was worth it, considering it was fun to some extent, that it has cards and how much time I spent playing it.","August 31, 2014","false","11.2"," 13 of 25 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","13","25","0","5"

This game is beautiful in its graphics and is very appealing to the eye, its just that once you get into the actual gameplay, it is very slow and almost doesn't progress in difficulty or controls at all. "Its meant to be a simple game! Its a thinking game!" I completely understand that aspect, it's just that while The Bridge tells you to do its excellently designed puzzles, it does nothing to keep you wanting to do the next thing, the storyline is little to nothing and the game starts off with you as an old man trying to climb up a hill which is the most boring intro experiences ever. "Its called minimalism!" I hear you say. I get that completely but while it accomplishes that goal it gives you nothing to hold on to, nothing to make you want to come back for more.

It's a puzzler, with a quirky but pleasing art style, plenty of content, and an appropriately large level of difficulty. I might even have recommended it a few years ago. But I've since been spoiled by puzzlers of tremendous quality, like Braid, Fez, Portal, and (more controversially) The Misadventures of P.B. Winterbottom.\n\nIn each of the above, the puzzles are soluble only with some kind of bright spark of an idea, with a relatively simple execution. In The Bridge, the puzzles often come down to trial and error, until eventually you arrive at a relatively complex execution. So, instead of a cathartic flash of inspiration at the end of a puzzle, instead you get a mild feeling of relief as the gauntlet is over.\n\nPerhaps if The Bridge had a more engaging style, like the above puzzlers do, its more grinding puzzles would not hold it back so. As it stands, The Bridge shoots for atmospheric, which it achieves to a limited extent. However, the atmosphere is too thin and too monotonous to really persuade me to come back to it.

I think the difficulty of a puzzle game should come from figuring out the puzzles, as figuring them out is what provides the feeling of accomplishment that, say, beating a boss in an action game provides. The problem is that this game's difficulty comes from fighting the controls and trying to make them do what you know has to be done. It gets very frustrating, even on easy levels, and the result is that I'm not compelled to continue. I was really looking forward to this just based on the screen shots, which I suppose is part of the problem; you only know a game controls poorly once you've tried it.","July 10, 2014","false","0.7"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

I really dig the penciled, black and white art direction of The Bridge, but the puzzles will make you feel more frustrated than smart.  It takes some obvious cues from games like Braid and reminds me of Monument Valley, but the easy to understand, reasonable difficulty curve of those titles are lost on The Bridge.  You move your avatar around and tilt the game world left or right while collecting keys and avoiding falling off the map or getting hit by a death ball.  The simple concept should lend itself to clean, heady puzzles, but fails as much as it succeeds.  The line art ends up getting in the way: it can be near impossible to tell what plane your character is standing or will end up while moving.  Many of the puzzles are also physics based and it's quite easy to screw something up by (reasonably) not thinking you should be finagaling the touchy objects as much as you have to.  This leads to frustrating solutions you'll most likely solve by endless tinkering and guesswork rather than looking at a level and feeling smart by reasoning it out.","July 15, 2015","false","3.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The mechanics revolve around rotating the world and manipulating gravity, and while you might think that would make for some interesting logic puzzles, it just ends up being incredibly sluggish and grey.  You play through four chapters of decent but unremarkable puzzles, then you go into a mirrored world of pretty much the same four chapters but with additional complications.  I stopped playing soon after getting into the mirrored world because the game just felt more like homework than entertainment.\n\nIf you're looking for a good puzzle game, this isn't it.  Try Portal, Limbo, Braid, Antichamber, or The Talos Principle.\n\nEdit:\nAlright, I went back and finished the game.  The puzzles get more interesting towards the end, but also more finicky.  Some require  you being very patient and precise as you carefully slide things around.  Some require you to lodge yourself against the edge of a button so you can slide other things around.  Some require you to to swing balls back and forth to try to get enough momentum.  Basically, you feel like you're fighting against the game mechanics instead of using them.  The experience is just not joyful the way better puzzle games are.","July 23, 2015","false","5.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I just don't have the motivation to play the game anymore. It's painful.\n\nSo heres my review for this game:\n\nInitially The Bridge might look interesting. The game definitely has that 'indie' vibe you get from games like FTL. However everything will eventually, and quickly become boring, painful sometimes. You're going to reach the point where getting the achievements is your only motivation. But for me, I couldn't care less about that anymore.\n\nSince its an indie-game there are little mechanics. The basic being 'moving time backwards' and 'rotating the area so the orientation of gravity changes'. However you don't really have full control of the rotation due to the limit of puzzles. So none of that creating looking stuff in Portal. The game tries to be fancy by adding annoying obstacles like the 'void', but after a level or two a new toy replaces it. It's like having your gum taken away before you could finish chewing all the taste out of it. In addition, the visuals are misleading. Am I talking about the inaccessible stairs or the obvious routes you are limited to? No. See the rain (gravity) they add in stage 3.\n\nThere's so little development, all those kewl new obstacles becomes repetitive quickly. This dude is just normal. Boringly normal. Song is boring. Literally the same stuff from stage 1 to the end.\n\nThe game feels more like a chore than an interactive piece of art. I literally cannot lower my standard anymore without trying to wake myself up from bordom.\n\n\nBut ♥♥♥♥ it was just 99 cents.","September 7, 2014","false","1.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Heavily inspired by the art of M.C. Escher it takes you into a world where up and down can be turned into it's heads.\n\nEach level has a door that you have to reach and in some cases open with the help of some keys. There are elements that you have to avoid in some cases but you can use for your advantage in other levels.\n\nGenerally, it does not require too much coordination to make things happen in real time and you can go at your own pace playing with the level until you find the right path. You could find a longer path but the game does not punishes for that. You complete each level or don't, there are no stars or differences for finding a solution quickly or with less effort,\n\nVery recommended.","June 19, 2014","true","7.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The art is gorgeous. The story is interesting, if a bit whimsical. I couldn't bring myself to play through the mirrored levels so perhaps the story gets more fleshed out later on. If you get the game for cheap you might just appreciate the art enough to find it worth the price anyway. I guess I kind of do. I've played through much worse games because I enjoyed an aspect of it like the music.\n\nMy biggest gripes with the Bridge comes down to basically two things. The controls are kind of clumsy, and everything is SO SLOW. It's hard to be precise, and many of the puzzles requires a fair bit of precision. I very much enjoy even very hard platformers or puzzle games, when the controls are tight and you feel fully, 100% in control of what's going on. Luckily you can rewind time in this game to try again, but it takes away some of the joy when you want to do one thing and the game disagrees. It's hard to anticipate in advance what might happen when you do one thing in the more physics-heavy puzzles, which lead me to my next point. Rewinding time is slow and takes you out of the game. Restarting a puzzle takes a bunch of time as well as I had to get into the menus every time. Your character walks super slow. Gravity is low, so it takes time for things to fall in place and you to see the actions of your thoughts.\n\nNew mechanics are introduced at times but are generally poorly explained. I enjoy finding out about things on my own! But not when it involves new controls that you only find out about through random button mashing or looking at the game controls again (for an action I didn't know how/where to perform it!). I was stuck on one of the simpler puzzles halfway into the game and had to resort to a youtube video only to proclaim "how was I supposed to know I could do that!"\n\nPerhaps I was hoping for more of a pure puzzle game rather than platformer. As it is I felt I spent too much time battling the intricacies of the game and tons of trial and error rather than thinking about how to approach things logically and figure out things in my head.\n\nI have no doubt many people enjoy the game, but these are my thoughts and someone may find them interesting or to be an influence in whether the game is worth a try.","February 1, 2015","false","2.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

You walk around, manipulating the gravity of the world, avoiding balls of death and collecting keys. Much like braid the complexity of the puzzles increase each level and there is often a new mechanic introduced.\n\nI would say that Either you love or hate this game, its very well done, but I am personally not the correct player for this type of game so I didnt like it very much after the first 3 chapters (each chapter is 7 levels).\n\nI kind of lost interest after a while to solve the levels, so I started looking at solutions on youtube for the final 2 levels and the mirror world levels, just so I could take the achievements. All in all I played 4.2 hours, but if you solve everything yourself then I wouldnt be surprised if it will take about 7-8 hours or more.\n\n\nGraphics is as they look like in the screenshots and trailers, personally i both like and dislike them, but they work fine for the purpose.\n\n\nTechnically the game worked fine, no crashes or anything, though it seems to run quite heavy, I couldnt play youtube movies in the steam overlay without them lagging.\n\n\nI would suggest buying Braid instead of this, better graphics, better music and better gameplay. Much less frustrating and more engaging story.\nIf youve already played Braid and want something more thinking-heavy, then you should get this.

The puzzles here are really tough and the learning curve is steep. There's a good reason for this though - once you've worked out the puzzle, that's it, it's over. It needs to be difficult to be playable at all. Which is a shame, because a game that's too hard takes away the fun of playing it. I don't feel like there's enough novelty of what you can do in this game as far as input goes - most of the game is either played in your head or trial and error.

I played the first 3 chapters and enjoyed them immensely. The riddles make sense and are pure logic.\nBut with chapter 4 they introduce a new element that just does not get explained and suddenly it's just try and error. There is no help in the game that explains how elements are working.\nAnd then there are bugs - I got stuck at a level in Chapter 4, so stopped playing to continue the next day. But instead of loading the correct level it was loading an already completed level. And then it jumped the one I failed previously. Given how long the title is on the market a bug they could have addressed by now.\n\nSo if you like logic riddles the first 3 chapters are among the nicest I have played in a long time. But if you find it frustrating when games go from logic to trial and error you might not want to buy this.","December 11, 2013","false","8.6"," 5 of 14 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","5","14","0","0"

Atmosphere is well done. No puzzle requires skill only thought (although some practice required). Relatively short game, entirely complete in a few hours. Time reversal serves to recover errors and refine movement quickly.\n\nNegatives: Doesn't play with optical illusions despite art style. While it feels very similar to Braid in style and utilises the same time reversal function, there is no contest on which is the better game. Time reversal not really explored beyond recovery of errors, bar one secret.\n\nConclusion: If you've not played Braid or are not intending to then this is an enjoyable puzzle game to add to your collection. Well contained this will not however have much replayability, good or bad depending what you are looking for. If you have Braid or were thinking about playing Braid, then this game from a puzzle perspective is the quite the inferior challenge and experience.","February 22, 2014","false","6.9"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

The game's biggest weakeness is that the normal game is too simple, but what seems like the "real" game, the mirror levels, is far too difficult.  The normal games puzzles are fairly easy to figure out without too much difficult, but rarely feel as rewarding as a great puzzle game often does when solving a particularly good one.  The mirror levels introduce such a level of execution difficulty that even when the solution is known, the execution level required makes the game very difficult.  Not a good endorsement of a puzzle game, in my mind.\n\nIn the end, despite completing all the normal levels and multiple mirror levels, I simply can't say this game gave me the puzzles or the satisfaction I was looking for, even when it was challenging.  Some great art and ideas, but the execution is lacking, and the cohesive whole is good, but never great.  If you love puzzle games, pick this up on sale, and you'll find some good there...but if you're on the fence, make sure you don't expect this to be another Braid, and go in with your expectation set accordingly.","October 5, 2014","false","6.0"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

In this modern era, most folks flock in droves mindlessly to the next huge broseph game, super sharp graphics with a simple theme using the same old formula. *Yawn* Then games like this one come along, and deserves nothing but praise, but alas, becasue of a general lack of mainstream promotions remain a "gem" in the gravel mostly passed by those who cannot think for themselves and are unable to choose what is a great game via hype trains. This was a pleasure and a joy so far. It challenges people to use a tool mostly ignored in modern gaming. A brain. (Sick burn dude) With challenging puzzles, amazing themes and mechanics, and a beautiful art style, it was a pleasure. When a puzzle is moments from being solved, and you strike that "AH-HA!" point, it feels so satisfying.\n\nNothing but props for this title.

The artwork is classically simple, but nothing very impressive.

Escher perfectly, but with a price in puzzle design. In concept, his mind bending art is perfect for creating interesting navigational puzzles, but their decisions to make the character slow in movement and the trial and error methods needed to solve the later puzzles ultimately lets down on the concept. By no means does this make it a poor game, quite the contrary; the earlier puzzles are truly gratifying, and while they do grow on some interesting concepts, the shortness of the games keeps it welcoming, so that the final few puzzles barely detract. A fictional story is also told describing the relationship between Escher and Sir Isaac Newton, and adds another layer to the game that makes progression all the more enjoyable.

With 8.5 hours into the game, I have all but completed the whole thing. The whole story was completed within probably 6 hours, if you would consider it a story. It's more of just multiple puzzles put together to really twist your brain. With each puzzle being completed, the story get just a little bit more "interesting".\n\nThe game does make you think; afterall it is a puzzler. You simply have to walk left and right or rotate the world left or right. With just those four directional queues, you have to maneuver your way through around 50 puzzles. If you make a mistake, you can rewind time as far back as you want or need to. It feel like an indepth platformer / puzzler.\n\nThe visual appeal is there in a sense. The game doesn't project visually stunning graphics. It's meant to have a simple, trippy, and hand drawn / rustic feeling. It gits the mysterious category it is portraying. The layout of the puzzles is what causes the trippy atmosphere. All of the puzzles encompass physically impossible maps and puzzle boards. Sometimes while rotating the world and walking, my eyes would flutter and become dizzy just from trying to comprehend how what I am doing is working.\n\nI don't play many games. I tend to look at them, think I'd enjoy them and add them to my library. This one actually caught my attention in my library and ended up binge playing it thoroughly. Is it worth the $9.99? I don't think so. If you can get it for a dollar or two, maybe. There was also a flaw in the game where, if you free fall for a long period of time, the framerate drops immensly to 1 or 2 fps. Very unhappy about that. This is the exact reason I did not get 100% of the achievements. The game also supports full controller support. I opted to use the keyboard only as 1) I didn't even realize that it supported the controller until I was 3/4 done this review and 2) I wanted to try just keyboard control. I use a controller 9/10 when playing a game through Steam or on my PC and wanted to really get a feel for the KB/M controls of games.\n\nOverall, I'm happy I played the game. It was interesting and something a little off the beaten path, per se. Would I ever play it again? I don't think so. Maybe once or twice to show people or try to get 100% one last time, but that's about it. I definitely won't be back anytime soon as I doubt the framerate issue will be fixed anytime soon.","January 31, 2015","true","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Escher's drawings of impossible buildings (with people walking on what should be a floor but you can't tell if it's actually the wall or the ceiling) and wondered what it would be like to wander around on that fantastical mind-bending playground, you need to play this game.\n\nImagine FEZ, but with a hand-sketched style and set inside an M.C. Escher drawing.  The mental challenge reminds me of trying to solve one of those puzzles where you have to remove the metal ring from a rope threaded through a couple blocks of wood, or try to separate different-shaped metal rings from each other.  This game provides the same sort of spatial puzzle-solving challenge.\n\nThe puzzles felt fair: nothing is hidden from you.  They do a great job with the difficulty curve: every level felt like it was just a little bit harder than the last one, and I didn't experience any big difficulty spikes.  That being said, once it gets going, this game does get quite difficult.  But if you stick with it and keep trying different things, you will keep making progress.  And every time you finish a tough level, the feeling of satisfaction and accomplishment is fantastic.\n\nIf you are looking for a tough but fair puzzle game, I highly recommend that you check out The Bridge.\n\n\n","January 29, 2015","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Escher perfectly, but with a price in puzzle design. In concept, his mind bending art is perfect for creating interesting navigational puzzles, but their decisions to make the character slow in movement and the trial and error methods needed to solve the later puzzles ultimately lets down on the concept. By no means does this make it a poor game, quite the contrary; the earlier puzzles are truly gratifying, and while they do grow on some interesting concepts, the shortness of the games keeps it welcoming, so that the final few puzzles barely detract. A fictional story is also told describing the relationship between Escher and Sir Isaac Newton, and adds another layer to the game that makes progression all the more enjoyable. The mirrored levels provided after the base game is completed, as well as numerous little challenges and hidden secrets keep the game very replayable, but only if you actively look for them. Otherwise, it is a charmingly brief experience that will most likely leave you with a feeling of both satisfaction and desire for a little bit more.\n\nProviding that you have the patience to wade through its more irritating puzzles, you will find a great little game, and a wonderful hommage to the legendary artist.","January 25, 2015","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The puzzles excel in requiring the manipulation of the player's perspective. And The Bridge excels when its showcasing these aspects.\n\nThe puzzles are short and tight, but by the end I felt they dragged a bit. It feels a bit tedious to push through the last 8 of the 48 total chapters. The story doesnt capture you enough to draw you into the game's conclusion. It's whimsical and vague. It doesnt tease you to draw you in, it teases you with the possibility of its existence. And ultimately, the lack of a story makes the last few levels feel like a grind instead of a reveal.\n\nAppreciate The Bridge's beauty and level design but quit once you feel like you've seen enough.","November 29, 2014","true","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The bridge is a perfect of example of how to confuse the heck out of me, while also keep me intrigued enough to keep pushing through. The puzzles are pretty hard at times, and I'll admit it, I was going cross eyed at a few specific moments. There were a few times I gave in and looked up the answer... only to find out that I was on the right track anyway.  This is a game where you want to take your time, and go slow, trying to figure each piece out.\n\nAs for the story, it's another puzzle in itself. Pretty much everyone, including myself, has their own interpretation of who you are, and the story surrounding all the characters.

Technically a No, but with a giant asterisk.\n\nI bought this game on sale for a dollar. I definitely got my dollar's worth. I think that if I had paid full price, I would have been disappointed, but only because of the glowing 9/10 reviews. Had I expected less, I would've been more satisfied with what I got.\n\nFirst, the puzzles themselves weren't great. There was no sense of build as I went on. I never felt like I was learning more about what it meant to interact in a world of impossible shapes. I had no "Aha!" moments where a shift in my thinking made the solution obvious. More than a few times my reaction was "Really? It was that easy?" The later puzzles pile on complexity but feel more like a slog than an intricate problem.\n\nThis is compounded by the second problem: The controls feel very clunky. It makes the exploratory / trial-and-error phase of learning about the puzzles more work than fun.\n\nIt's not all bad. The art and sound design are excellent. There is some fun puzzling to be had. It's just overall the game fails to deliver. I give it 6 misspent youths out of a possible 10.

So I bought this interesting game for just 70p to see what it's like. I was rather disappointed.\nThe game delivers a nice looking world with each level that is fun to look at as the landscape is very confusing, using quirky optical illusions to distort the map. This I really liked but in the way of puzzle gameplay it was slow and not very challenging. I found I could complete most levels through just using trial and error once or twice to get to the end instead of actually using my brain to figure out where I was meant to go and how I was supposed to minipulate the terrain (yes this can be considered a fault on my part and I respect that). The one time I did use my brain to track my steps through the puzzle world was more like going through a maze than completing a puzzle, not a very puzzling level.\nAnother reason I don't recommend it is the progression through the levels is not at all rewarding. The story was not at all interesting if at all existent, and the reason I say this is because at the end of each level there was a thought for you to read. It did not tell a story or explained why this was happening, it was just nonsense. This coupled with the very uninteresting new components added each chapter, left me with no motivation to continue through the levels to discover what was at the end. It also didn't help that the character walks the pace of a snail, "If you would like to get there this life time that would be great."\nWhat I did like about the game was the ability to warp back in time when you failed, instead of completely restarting the game. Having to restart every time I died, keys flying off the map, boulders getting too up close and personal, would of been very irritating. The map design was very clever with all the optical illusions and the confusing layout, with the added art form the maps where nice to look at and very unique.\nThe game is unique with map and puzzle design but not fun to play and gives no reason to continue playing.","August 28, 2014","false","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I thought the mirrored levels would be simple, but while the room is a mirror of the original, there are other twists to add challenges to them as well.\n\nThe game's artwork is again, simple, but genuinely good.  The levels are black & white, but animated in a similar manner as old cartoons; things like the shading of the doors changing from frame to frame, giving it a mild flicker.  It's delightfully charming and a nice touch.\n\nOverall, a highly recommended puzzler.","August 29, 2014","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Technically a No, but with a giant asterisk.\n\nI bought this game on sale for a dollar. I definitely got my dollar's worth. I think that if I had paid full price, I would have been disappointed, but only because of the glowing 9/10 reviews. Had I expected less, I would've been more satisfied with what I got.\n\nFirst, the puzzles themselves weren't great. There was no sense of build as I went on. I never felt like I was learning more about what it meant to interact in a world of impossible shapes. I had no "Aha!" moments where a shift in my thinking made the solution obvious. More than a few times my reaction was "Really? It was that easy?" The later puzzles pile on complexity but feel more like a slog than an intricate problem.\n\nThis is compounded by the second problem: The controls feel very clunky. It makes the exploratory / trial-and-error phase of learning about the puzzles more work than fun.\n\nIt's not all bad. The art and sound design are excellent. There is some fun puzzling to be had. It's just overall the game fails to deliver. I give it 6 misspent youths out of a possible 10.

The game itself has you controlling perspective and gravity to solve puzzles that play out in 360 degrees on the 2D plane, and the landscapes are modeled from the mathematical artworks of M.C. Escher. Given that the landscapes are made using real works of art, and his thick hand drawn style is applied to the game, it should come as no surprise that The Bridge is as good looking as it is.

The bridge is a perfect of example of how to confuse the heck out of me, while also keep me intrigued enough to keep pushing through. The puzzles are pretty hard at times, and I'll admit it, I was going cross eyed at a few specific moments. There were a few times I gave in and looked up the answer... only to find out that I was on the right track anyway.  This is a game where you want to take your time, and go slow, trying to figure each piece out.\n\nAs for the story, it's another puzzle in itself. Pretty much everyone, including myself, has their own interpretation of who you are, and the story surrounding all the characters. And it manages to do so without coming off as pretentious, or having a "you're not playing it right" vibe that some open-ended games have.\n\nFull recommendation!","November 12, 2014","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not as much as say Antichamber, but it will force you to think ahead with how your manipulations affect the world around you.\n\nYou play as an unnamed intellectual (who bears a striking resemblance to surrealist M. C. Escher) who starts out napping under an apple tree. After discovering your ability to rotate the world, you get him awake and discover a number of puzzle doors have appeared in his house; why and how they are here is hinted at in text descriptions given by the protagonist but nothing is really explained. A sense of dread accompanies the game's progress. The first time you meet 'the menace' (balls with huge grinning faces that kill you with one touch), there is an uneasy feeling that something is wrong with these places beyond their defiance of reality.\n\nThe art is pretty in black and white; the story that is there serves as a vehicle to put you through the puzzles. There is a sense of achievement to be had with the later ones when momentum and quick thinking rotations come into play. One mechanic that could have been explained better is "the Veil", which is a curtain that lets you manipulate the gravitational pull on certain objects. At first I thought it let me rotate objects independent of myself, but eventually deciphered its effects. I blundered through the veil puzzles a good bit before its potential hit me.\n\nI got this for a dollar and found it easily worth that amount. Depending on your love of puzzle games, it is a good game to lose yourself in while trying to manipulate how to get the protagonist to his exit door. The downside is there is little to no replay. Some achievements help pad out the length as well as hidden collectibles, but basically the 48 puzzles behind the doors are it. The first half of the game is easy as it introduces concepts for you to play with, but then in the second half things get pretty tricky.\n\nThe Bridge would make Escher proud. Not a game you buy for the story but for the experience of solving its strange puzzles and experiencing its strange, ruined landscapes.","September 6, 2014","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The art truly matches the game concept, the puzzles require a bit of understanding but they're not hard at all. The game mechanics and the timing suit perfectly and indeed this allow to solve a few puzzles in different ways (you don't have to catch that tiny combination of space and time all the time). Maybe puzzles could've been more complicated, but that could've taken away from the overall balance. It really is an enjoyable experience.\n\nFor one thing maybe, the story/plot doesn't really play the most part, it's about puzzles. And the background music fits but doesn't play a role aswell. But in the end, you will need some concentration to go through the puzzles - it's really balanced as it is.","September 6, 2014","true","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not comparable to Antichamber.\nGameplay: 9/10 - Clever use of grinning balls of doom, spaghettifying not-black holes, keys, sliding doors, and plain old gravity make this puzzle-by-puzzle game appealing. It could do with a little more explanation, though. The puzzles are deceptively simple in most cases, but nonetheless require a significant amount of brainpower. Don't expect to simply sit down and beat the game; breaks are mandatory.\nStory: 7/10 - You get doses of story at the end of each chapter, but there seems to be no way to go back and view them again, making it very difficult to piece the whole shebang together into some notion of what is going on.\nInterface and Graphics: 9/10 - The Bridge utilizes its own unique style of graphics, where black-and-white figures are drawn before you at the start of each level. The animations show stray pencil marks flashing in and out of existence around the characters, as if they are constantly being redrawn at 60 DPS (draws per second). The interface, and all text, all appears charmingly hand-drawn.\nOverall: 8.75/10 - Worth a buy, especially if you get it on sale. Not for the faint of mind.

I thought the mirrored levels would be simple, but while the room is a mirror of the original, there are other twists to add challenges to them as well.\n\nThe game's artwork is again, simple, but genuinely good.

It just spinning spinning spinning aaaand u got the key.\n*Sound could be better, and also music variety is poor\n*Dialogues.. hmmm.. No important dialogue I could remember.

It's a puzzle platformer with simple controls: you can move your avatar left and right, and rotate the entire level clockwise and counterclockwise—and that's it, but it gets a lot of milage out of those simple controls, with increasingly difficult puzzles that require you to understand the game's mechanics to make it to the end of each level.\nAfter 24 levels, I thought I'd reached the end, but it turns out that this was just the halfway point, after which you're required to return to a harder version of each of the previous levels. Maybe I would have kept playing if the controls didn't feel so sluggish, or if the music hadn't become so very tedious, but at this point I've had my fill. Still, it's a decent game and I'd reccomend it, but it wasn't a revelatory experience on the level of Braid or FEZ.","May 22, 2014","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Escher. If you don't know who that it is, it doesn't really matter as the game stands alone well enough. The puzzles are complex enough to be challenging at times but not in a cerebral manner. More often than not I knew what I was supposed to do to finish the puzzle, I simply had difficulty doing it because it required a precise maneuver. This became very frustrating to me at times as on some of the levels I ended up getting smashed by the little lion marble things over and over again simply because I couldn't fall or move precisely right. Having also played games like Antichamber, Portal and Portal 2, I found this games puzzles to be much more annoying than the puzzles which those games present (which wasn't a good thing) as the puzzles of those games didn't rely so much on that precision.\n\nIn many ways, the game is essentially a digital version of this little marble game I played as a kid. The game consisted of a marble which you had to guide (by titling the board) through a maze rife with holes. If your marble fell into one of the holes as you were tilting the board, you had to start over. The game was never a riddle as you knew you had to tilt the board to get by the holes, but it was difficult because of the skill required to move the marble precisely how you wanted. The Bridge is basically an updated version of this.\n\nThe game does boast a fairly unique build and look and the artwork at times is intriguing. There is little to no storyline however and what little they do incorporate is very esoteric. The game does feature an interesting soundtrack, but it is underutilized.\n\nThe gameplay was interesting enough to me to finish it (which took less than ten hours) and so I think I can recommend it if you can purchase it while the game is on sale. If it's not, you may not feel like you're getting your money's worth and you probably shouldn't buy it. If, in the end, you are an enthusiast of Escher's artwork and impossible figures and structures (such as endless staircases etc) then it may be worth the full price of the game, but otherwise just wait for the price to drop.","December 26, 2013","true","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's advertised as a strategy (puzzle) game and that's what it is (no problems there).  All the puzzles are interesting and involve walking through an environment, rotating that environment, and inverting yourself.  In general, each "level" consists of multiple "stages."  The early stages in each level tend to be easy and the final ones tend to be hard.  Again, no problem.  What I have issue with is that several of the puzzles hide the mechanism for solving it instead of just making the solution more complex.  Specifically, there are broken edges to the world that in almost every case, you can't walk/rotate around.  But, in a couple of puzzles, you can (and must).  There's also a problem with the velocity of the transit.  And then, there's the final Steam Achievement:  Collector.  It's pure gamification.  There's not a chance in the world that anyone could ever find more than one of these naturally.  The only way to find them is to do a search online.  Because of this unnecessary frustration, I was "this close" to rating the game down.  But, I did get several hours of thought out of the game.  So, I'm sticking with a Thumbs Up.","December 26, 2013","true","12.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It might take you maybe one to two hours to complete the first world before unlocking the dark version of the game, which is about the same length.

Escher's works. It's main feature is its crazy impossible space and really cool space manipulation mechanics. It also features some time-manipulation mechanic that reminds me of Braid - You can rewind time if you make mistakes, so there isn't really a "game-over" state.\n\nFor the most part, solving a level is just a matter of figuring out how to navigate the weird space you find yourself in. That is not an easy feat since you can easily get disoriented by the impossible geometry. In a few levels timing your moves plays significant role too.\n\nThere are 4 worlds with about 6 levels each. In each world a new gameplay mechanic is added making the game more complex the further you progress. After you complete the game, you can revisit each level in a 'mirrored' mode which features new and more difficult puzzles.\n\nDepending on your ability and on how much time you spend looking for hidden items and completing achievements, the game can probably take anywhere between 4 to 10 hours. It took me about 7; although I did use a guide to find in what levels each of the hidden items are located, I did take me a while to finish some of the harder levels.\n\n\nSo, if you like puzzle platformers and enjoy M.C.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/id_unavailable/recommended/204240/","id_unavailable","Thrillhouse","http://steamcommunity.com/id/id_unavailable/","932 products in account","Enjoyable and short puzzle-platformer where the "gimmick" is the ability to rotate the entire level in order to manipulate the gravity of you and other objects around you. The rotation is similar to And Yet It Moves in that regard, and there's a simple time-rewind mechanic in order to undo your mistakes (although this does not actually factor into any of the actual puzzles for the most part). There's also an "overworld" that consists of your house, the yard around it, and multiple doors to the different, numbered worlds (and individual doors to each of the sub-levels in those worlds). So in those two regards (overworld layout and the simple "undo your mistakes" button), it somewhat reminds me of Braid. The art style is interesting, complete with odd geometry and floating objects, but the lack of color for the main game gets a bit tiring. The puzzles have a good difficulty curve, and getting all the achievements requires some work (and/or guides). It's not very long and feels like And Yet It Moves with touches of Braid, but the mechanics and difficulty are both solid. I'd buy it on sale for a few dollars.","January 25, 2014","true","16.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

If you like perspective and logic puzzles this is not to be missed.\n\nThe dreamy hand drawn and monochramic art style is full of great little details and the different level elements really come into prominence when you start rotating and using the stage. In one level I hadn't noticed that the 'log' on the ground was actually a lit candle when the stage was rotated 90 degrees and the candle was suddenly upright. Flourishes like how the character is sketched into each level, and the way a  'trace' of him is left each time you fail and rewind, lend a lot of personality to the game as well. It feels like an Escher drawing so it really does feel like we're in the playground of his imagination.\n\nI play puzzle games in small bursts but I can already tell that The Bridge is one of those special games where I will be eager to tackle and finish the puzzles and the game, but I'll also be hoping that the game won't end any time soon.\n\nGreat  stuff.\n\nA+","June 20, 2015","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Escher. If you don't know who that it is, it doesn't really matter as the game stands alone well enough. The puzzles are complex enough to be challenging at times but not in a cerebral manner. More often than not I knew what I was supposed to do to finish the puzzle, I simply had difficulty doing it because it required a precise maneuver. This became very frustrating to me at times as on some of the levels I ended up getting smashed by the little lion marble things over and over again simply because I couldn't fall or move precisely right. Having also played games like Antichamber, Portal and Portal 2, I found this games puzzles to be much more annoying than the puzzles which those games present (which wasn't a good thing) as the puzzles of those games didn't rely so much on that precision.\n\nIn many ways, the game is essentially a digital version of this little marble game I played as a kid. The game consisted of a marble which you had to guide (by titling the board) through a maze rife with holes. If your marble fell into one of the holes as you were tilting the board, you had to start over. The game was never a riddle as you knew you had to tilt the board to get by the holes, but it was difficult because of the skill required to move the marble precisely how you wanted. The Bridge is basically an updated version of this.\n\nThe game does boast a fairly unique build and look and the artwork at times is intriguing. There is little to no storyline however and what little they do incorporate is very esoteric. The game does feature an interesting soundtrack, but it is underutilized.\n\nThe gameplay was interesting enough to me to finish it (which took less than ten hours) and so I think I can recommend it if you can purchase it while the game is on sale. If it's not, you may not feel like you're getting your money's worth and you probably shouldn't buy it. If, in the end, you are an enthusiast of Escher's artwork and impossible figures and structures (such as endless staircases etc) then it may be worth the full price of the game, but otherwise just wait for the price to drop.","December 26, 2013","true","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It could do with a little more explanation, though. The puzzles are deceptively simple in most cases, but nonetheless require a significant amount of brainpower.

The animations show stray pencil marks flashing in and out of existence around the characters, as if they are constantly being redrawn at 60 DPS (draws per second).

Don't expect to simply sit down and beat the game; breaks are mandatory.\nStory: 7/10 - You get doses of story at the end of each chapter, but there seems to be no way to go back and view them again, making it very difficult to piece the whole shebang together into some notion of what is going on.\nInterface and Graphics: 9/10 - The Bridge utilizes its own unique style of graphics, where black-and-white figures are drawn before you at the start of each level. The animations show stray pencil marks flashing in and out of existence around the characters, as if they are constantly being redrawn at 60 DPS (draws per second). The interface, and all text, all appears charmingly hand-drawn.\nOverall: 8.75/10 - Worth a buy, especially if you get it on sale. Not for the faint of mind. Breaks are highly recommended.","August 13, 2013","true","6.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Escher perfectly, but with a price in puzzle design. In concept, his mind bending art is perfect for creating interesting navigational puzzles, but their decisions to make the character slow in movement and the trial and error methods needed to solve the later puzzles ultimately lets down on the concept. By no means does this make it a poor game, quite the contrary; the earlier puzzles are truly gratifying, and while they do grow on some interesting concepts, the shortness of the games keeps it welcoming, so that the final few puzzles barely detract. A fictional story is also told describing the relationship between Escher and Sir Isaac Newton, and adds another layer to the game that makes progression all the more enjoyable. The mirrored levels provided after the base game is completed, as well as numerous little challenges and hidden secrets keep the game very replayable, but only if you actively look for them. Otherwise, it is a charmingly brief experience that will most likely leave you with a feeling of both satisfaction and desire for a little bit more.\n\nProviding that you have the patience to wade through its more irritating puzzles, you will find a great little game, and a wonderful hommage to the legendary artist.","January 25, 2015","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The puzzles excel in requiring the manipulation of the player's perspective. And The Bridge excels when its showcasing these aspects.\n\nThe puzzles are short and tight, but by the end I felt they dragged a bit. It feels a bit tedious to push through the last 8 of the 48 total chapters. The story doesnt capture you enough to draw you into the game's conclusion. It's whimsical and vague. It doesnt tease you to draw you in, it teases you with the possibility of its existence.

It layers each of its mechanics slowly, and, before you know it, you’re stumped in a puzzle where gravity is sideways, alternate gravity is upside-down, the map screen is tilted at a 45-degree angle, and the Newton-wannabe that you control is falling off of the platform.  Luckily, when you die, you can rewind time in a very Braid-like manner to re-attempt the puzzle. The game is built on the ability to rotate the screen, changing the gravity for the protagonist and allowing him to access otherwise unreachable destinations. In each puzzle, you must get a key and go through a door. This simple goal becomes complicated when the Escher-inspired puzzles begin rotating.  As you explore more puzzles, other features are introduced: a white plane and a black plane, the ability to change or align these planes’ gravity, and a portal that flips the 2D puzzle entirely.\n\nI find the black-and-white art beautiful, but it’s distracting or obscuring in some puzzles. The story also takes a note from Braid: minor bits after a few puzzles, fed to you with a vague, heavy hand. I’m not sure where the Faux Newton plot is going, but I don’t care. As long as you don’t take the game as seriously as it wants you take it, it’s enjoyable.","June 27, 2014","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Some levels take careful planning, and even when you see how to solve the level, working out how to make it happen can be tricky as well!  6 rooms in each of 4 levels, and then the same mirrored; 48 levels in all.  I thought the mirrored levels would be simple, but while the room is a mirror of the original, there are other twists to add challenges to them as well.\n\nThe game's artwork is again, simple, but genuinely good.  The levels are black & white, but animated in a similar manner as old cartoons; things like the shading of the doors changing from frame to frame, giving it a mild flicker.  It's delightfully charming and a nice touch.\n\nOverall, a highly recommended puzzler.","August 29, 2014","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's an excellent mix. I love the story (or the implication of one) and the art style; it's absolutely beautiful.","October 24, 2013","true","19.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

It plays into the designs of impossible structures held by nothing while containing abstract obstacles and items. With the main focus of turning the world I was immediately reminded of fez. I quickly found however that most of the puzzles are pretty one note, at least in early segments. The game shapes the world in a sort of makeshift labyrinth like the wooden ball in a maze puzzles. It's all well and good until you realize that the world isn't hiding secret details you're overlooking or hiding ways to use the mechanics that you didn't notice. That aspect which turned games like Braid and The Swapper much harder by revealing what was right in front of you part by part made them maddening puzzles, which clear inspiration from the former for level selects, and story building tends to feel egregious when it ignores these same aspects in order to layer new mechanics or objects without expanding the base ones. That said, the game is still both beatiful and interesting, making it hard to ignore even with it's setbacks.","January 22, 2014","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The puzzles are all fairly solvable for the first half, but for the second half...  well I've been consulting the walkthrough info regularly.  I'd say this is one of my favorite games now.  It combines a unique/compelling visual style with an enjoyable set of puzzles that all involve manipulating gravity by rotating the world.  I really loved the hand-drawn artwork and simple but effective animation.  The visual and audio cues are all very helpful in solving the puzzles.  I don't think the game ever relies entirely on audio, so it's a game that hearing impaired folks will be able to enjoy.  The gameplay is mostly about reasoning out a problem, rather than twitch based controls (although there are a few occasions on which timing and twitch mechanics were employed).  I hope more people realise what a bargain this game is.  I think it has the hand-drawn aesthetic of Braid with the puzzle satisfaction that Portal brings.  Also, you don't die, you just rewind so you can really take your time in solving puzzles, and you never lose your progress.

But that one at least was fun.\n\nGraphics style is good.\nMusic is basically missing and the few chords get annoying soon.\nThe first three worlds are way too simple.\nThe fourth world gets interesting and challenging, but it never explains the gravity changing principles properly, you're likely to search for help online.\nThe last level and the following "mirrored worlds" are based on ugly gimmicks, like pixel positioning. Many parts of that are no longer a puzzle game, but something like a reverse platformer (try to hit that ledge with that ball by controlling gravity).\nYou never know what you can step on (and from which angle) and what is just decoration.\nThe loading times are terrible.\n\nBut worst of all, the whole game is unbelievably slow. All animations take eternity, the gravity rotation is very slow, the game time can't be sped up, and reversing time is tiringly slow as well (if you spent 2 minutes without movement just pondering about the level and then want to return past that point, you're going to spend a lot of time looking at a still character). The whole game is so lazy, that it took me all my will to continue with more levels in the mirrored worlds. It's just wasting your time instead of letting you play. And all of that could be solved so easily - let people skip initial level animations, and add a button to speed up game time.

With 8.5 hours into the game, I have all but completed the whole thing. The whole story was completed within probably 6 hours, if you would consider it a story. It's more of just multiple puzzles put together to really twist your brain. With each puzzle being completed, the story get just a little bit more "interesting".\n\nThe game does make you think; afterall it is a puzzler. You simply have to walk left and right or rotate the world left or right. With just those four directional queues, you have to maneuver your way through around 50 puzzles. If you make a mistake, you can rewind time as far back as you want or need to. It feel like an indepth platformer / puzzler.\n\nThe visual appeal is there in a sense. The game doesn't project visually stunning graphics. It's meant to have a simple, trippy, and hand drawn / rustic feeling. It gits the mysterious category it is portraying. The layout of the puzzles is what causes the trippy atmosphere. All of the puzzles encompass physically impossible maps and puzzle boards. Sometimes while rotating the world and walking, my eyes would flutter and become dizzy just from trying to comprehend how what I am doing is working.\n\nI don't play many games. I tend to look at them, think I'd enjoy them and add them to my library. This one actually caught my attention in my library and ended up binge playing it thoroughly. Is it worth the $9.99? I don't think so. If you can get it for a dollar or two, maybe. There was also a flaw in the game where, if you free fall for a long period of time, the framerate drops immensly to 1 or 2 fps. Very unhappy about that. This is the exact reason I did not get 100% of the achievements. The game also supports full controller support. I opted to use the keyboard only as 1) I didn't even realize that it supported the controller until I was 3/4 done this review and 2) I wanted to try just keyboard control. I use a controller 9/10 when playing a game through Steam or on my PC and wanted to really get a feel for the KB/M controls of games.\n\nOverall, I'm happy I played the game. It was interesting and something a little off the beaten path, per se. Would I ever play it again? I don't think so. Maybe once or twice to show people or try to get 100% one last time, but that's about it. I definitely won't be back anytime soon as I doubt the framerate issue will be fixed anytime soon.","January 31, 2015","true","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not comparable to Antichamber.\nGameplay: 9/10 - Clever use of grinning balls of doom, spaghettifying not-black holes, keys, sliding doors, and plain old gravity make this puzzle-by-puzzle game appealing. It could do with a little more explanation, though. The puzzles are deceptively simple in most cases, but nonetheless require a significant amount of brainpower. Don't expect to simply sit down and beat the game; breaks are mandatory.\nStory: 7/10 - You get doses of story at the end of each chapter, but there seems to be no way to go back and view them again, making it very difficult to piece the whole shebang together into some notion of what is going on.\nInterface and Graphics: 9/10 - The Bridge utilizes its own unique style of graphics, where black-and-white figures are drawn before you at the start of each level. The animations show stray pencil marks flashing in and out of existence around the characters, as if they are constantly being redrawn at 60 DPS (draws per second). The interface, and all text, all appears charmingly hand-drawn.\nOverall: 8.75/10 - Worth a buy, especially if you get it on sale. Not for the faint of mind.

If you're physically impaired, I can assure you that the physical dexterity of the player is not a benefit nor detriment for enjoying this game. There is no jumping or platforming, and fast reflexes can't help with any of the puzzles. The game is rock solidly designed to make all puzzles challenging only on an intellectual level, which I applaud.\n\nIf you're looking for 'play at your own pace' games, I can recommend The Bridge.\n\n\nThe Bridge is basically a poor man's Braid.\nFirst, I'll say that it has PLENTY of levels -- as long as you're the kind of person who thinks that when their Castlevania map got flipped upside down, it gave you twice the gameplay value. :\\n\nWhile the Escher-esque navigation is kinda neat, it doesn't add much particular depth. Especially since it doesn't get developed much after the second chapter. You'll get used to it in less time than it takes to adapt to the Arcane Sancutary level in Diablo II. But to it's merit, the presentation is incredibly smooth.\n\nAnyway, I got 87% through the regular (non-mirrored) level set before getting bored. (I got halfway through chapter four, and there's only "four" chapters. :\)\n\nThe Bridge could use more variety in the soundtrack, a deeper ( / existant?) plot to reflect the themes of the puzzles, and new art assets being revealed with continuing levels. Once you've played halfway through chapter two, you pretty much know how the next two chapters will look, feel, and be solved. What a shame.\n\nAlso, the puzzles just don't feel very clever. I got about half of the 'do a puzzle in a special way' achievements without even realizing I was earning them on the first run through the puzzle.\n\nConclusion:\nIf you find it on sale for a dollar -- like I did -- then it's worth experiencing the first two chapters.","September 13, 2014","false","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Look no further.\n\nAll you have to do is figure out how to twist and the turn the various puzzles to get keys to unlock their doors. Sounds simple but it isn't. There's obstacles that can fall on you because gravity very much exists. As much as I just want to walk on the ceiling because that'd be really easy I can't.\n\nAll in all, this is a good time killer and super mellow.... most of the time. :P","June 14, 2015","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you like perspective and logic puzzles this is not to be missed.\n\nThe dreamy hand drawn and monochramic art style is full of great little details and the different level elements really come into prominence when you start rotating and using the stage. In one level I hadn't noticed that the 'log' on the ground was actually a lit candle when the stage was rotated 90 degrees and the candle was suddenly upright. Flourishes like how the character is sketched into each level, and the way a  'trace' of him is left each time you fail and rewind, lend a lot of personality to the game as well. It feels like an Escher drawing so it really does feel like we're in the playground of his imagination.\n\nI play puzzle games in small bursts but I can already tell that The Bridge is one of those special games where I will be eager to tackle and finish the puzzles and the game, but I'll also be hoping that the game won't end any time soon.\n\nGreat  stuff.\n\nA+","June 20, 2015","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The puzzles are engaging and you really feel a sigh of relief and a sense of achievement when you finsh this game. The achievements set up a good challenge as some are really hard to get which adds a little extra to the game. There are a lot of puzzles in this game there are 8 main chapters and 9 sub-chapters per chapter (72 in total). There is a lot of replability in this game once you have forgoten the puzzle's solutions.\n\nI liked the black and white asthetic style. It suits the game and is fitting for the story.\n\nIf you pay enough attention to the environment you can tell that there is a story behind all the things that you are doing. I did not feel as though the story was forced on me though so if you just want a puzzle game that is what you will get.\n\nOverall I enjoyed this game and found the puzzles a real challenge. I am ashamed to say it, but I had to look at a walkthrough for a couple of puzzles because I just could not work them out. If you are like me and you love stories there is a subtle one running throughout, but as I say it can by just a puzzle game.","June 20, 2015","true","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The puzzles overall are a mix of casual, which get progressively harder or more time-sensitive as you get further into the game.\n\nI think one of the driving factors against it would be it's limited playtime, which many puzzle games suffer from - there's not a lot of replayability here, so it's more-or-less a one-and-done game.\n\nIt's not a bad game, but I agree with another reviewer in how it's somewhere in the middle for me, in terms of recommend/not recommend. It was about 10 hours total that I had spent play this game, including all puzzles and achievements. For the original store price and the time it takes to complete the game, I probably wouldn't recommend buying it - wait for a coupon or a sale.","June 9, 2015","true","10.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I love puzzle platformers and I love the art style. The puzzle mechanic though is not very well thought out and requires more trial and error trying to get the weird physics used to work right than it does actual puzzle solving. If you love games like Braid, Winterbottom or even Fez it might be worth a look, but I feel there are much better puzzle games on Steam worth playing before you give this one a try.","August 29, 2015","false","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
