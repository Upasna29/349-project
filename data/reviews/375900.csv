I'm not a fan either, but this review will do nothing to challenge your opinion.\n\nAnd so we begin...\n\nRead through the negative reviews and you'll begin to see a pattern emerge. A depressing, banal pattern. A group of people so deeply ingrained into their own cosy society they fail to see the forest for the trees.\n\nTrackMania Turbo does not let you customise your avatar. Shocker! Nor does it let you customise your car, your name, your horn or your server. I mean, strictly speaking, it does let you customise three of those things, but not in the same way its predecessor, TrackMania 2 did. You'll unlock new skins and stickers as you progress through the game, and hosting a multiplayer session supplies you with more or less all of the options you'd reasonably expect from a game of this type. Happy times, right?\n\nBut wait. This isn't good enough for the snivelling elite. "Why can't I choose my OWN avatar?" they cry. "What if I want to assault players' ears with some Katy Perry while they drive?", "Why am I unable to smear their screens with ugly and pointless UI elements, just so I can enjoy a modest sense of authority?". The previous TrackMania game was undoubtedly far more open in terms of customisation. The reality is, however, that most of it was trash. I'm sorry, but custom horns and car skins are NOT that exciting and the majority of private servers looked as though someone had just eaten a phone book and promptly thrown up over the screen. Enough of that bullcrap about consoles dumbing down PC games, TrackMania was in desperate need of a clean up.\n\nAnd that's precisely what Nadeo have done. They've scraped off the scum and revealed a sparkling core underneath. Let me describe said core.\n\nPut simply, TrackMania can be described as a hotlap racer. The aim of the game is not to outwit your opponents in a head-to-head battle, but to master the track. This goal is enforced by the fact you're not actually able to collide with other cars at all. In both single player and online, other racers are essentially ghosts, forming vague representations of your opponents and their efforts to set low lap times. To put it simply, your biggest enemy is yourself. You'll repeat tracks over and over in quick succession, tapping the reset/restart buttons whenever the slightest mistake is made and slowly but surely, edging your way ever closer to perfection. Once you complete a lap (or several, in multilap events) your time will be awarded and your position displayed; bronze, silver or gold in single player and your rank versus other players in online matches. Then you'll hit the restart button for the thousandth time, because you know you can do better.\n\nIn many racing games, this style of play could rightfully be considered dull, but not here. You've probably noticed via the promotional material that TrackMania tracks are out of this world cer-ay-zay. Drifting? Check. Blistering high speeds? You got it. Twists, loops, ramps, quarter pipes, magnetic tracks, jumps, wall rides and nail-biting close calls with brick walls? Par for the course, my friend! This is the true essence of TrackMania. The beating heart. The reason you came. And the same can be said for all TrackMania games. They're fantastic. The single thread that runs through the series, the one unifying theme that ties the franchise together... is the track design and the ability to create your own tracks. That hasn't gone anywhere. It's present in TrackMania Turbo and quite possibly better than ever.\n\nOn the subject of unity, another point of contention seems to be the apparent separation of the player base. This is probably going to come across as patronising, but... yeah, that's kind of the nature of sequels. The general idea is that most players switch over, new players join and only a few stragglers are left behind. If you really want to whine about separation, direct it at the previous game. You know, the one that split each environment into individual releases. The truth is that TrackMania Turbo has done more to fix the separation issue than it has to worsen it. The more people move forward and pick it up, the more unified the community will be.\n\nNow, I'm not saying this is a flawless game. I have a modest, slowly growing list of issues I'd like to see addressed with a patch, but I had a list for the previous game too. A fairly sizeable list, if I'm honest. However, stepping back, taking a look at what really matters and focusing your attention on those central suppliers of enjoyment is all it takes to prove that ALL TrackMania titles are games worth playing. TrackMania Turbo being no exception.","March 24","true","35.5"," 680 of 852 people (80%) found this review helpful 51 people found this review funny","80","680","852","51","46"

No dedicated servers, no local or Dedimania leaderboards online, no customization of cars or nicknames, no way to hide your opponents, only 100 players max, a dumbed down console port that treats its users as a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and on top of that forces you to install and always log onto Uplay.\n\nI've been playing ALL Trackmania games since the first game came out 13 years ago. Trackmania United is by far my favorite, though Trackmania Stadium 2 ain't too bad either. Trackmania never really was a $60 AAA game; it's a fun game which you can jump into and play for 30 mins and then alt+f4 back to reality. It's a chill game series but has the ability to let you practice for hundreds of hours to master the fine physics to become the best. Trackmania Turbo is not that kind of a game.\n\nTrackmania Turbo is mediocre, and it disappoints in so many areas. This is the first game in the series that forces you to install a third party client called Uplay. Why this nonsense? Not any particular reason, it's apparently just how Ubisoft deal with all their games. You can't opt out from it at all. You gotta make a separate account and then log into both Steam and Uplay every time you wanna play the game. It sucks. Another thing is max 100 players. This isn't impressive at all if you've played the previous games where there have been 700 players online on one server fighting for the podium. PCs can handle that. Stop forcing PC gamers to follow the console limitations.\n\nI really looks as if they just took the shell of the previous games and add some restrictions and removed some freedom and customization. I'm requesting a refund but might buy it at the summer sales if it's like 85% off.\n\nDon't waste your money.","March 24","false","1.2"," 1,009 of 1,348 people (75%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","75","009","1","22","68"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/proloser2/recommended/375900/","proloser2","danodude","http://steamcommunity.com/id/proloser2/","76 products in account","A lot of people have the wrong idea about Trackmania Turbo. They are seeing it as a sequel to Trackmania 2 (also known as ManiaPlanet). The fact of the matter is that TMT is infact, NOT a sequel. It is merely a spin off for consoles, except that the developers brought it to PC so we wouldn't miss out too.\n\nIf you approach TMT as a side project, and not a sequel to TM2, then it is a very fun, enjoyable experience. It has all the stuff that is required for fun times with friends and other players online. Up to 4 player splitscreen, Double Driver mode (where two people control one car), and, of course a single player mode and track editor.\n\nFor those of you who are freaking out about the 'consolified' editor, calm down! The classic editor is still there, to access it, start making a new map, and then you just need to move your mouse up to the top of the screen (so the menu bar shows), and click on the cog/gear, and choose the classic editor :)\n\nFor video makers, the video editor is still there, too. It's accessed the same way (via the menu bar's cog/gear) on any of the main menus.\n\nPhysics-wise, Nadeo seem to have tweaked the handling of existing environments (Canyon, Stadium, and Valley). None of the tweaking has rendered the environments bad to play, and they still retain their exclusively different handling styles.\n\nI can't give a complete coverage of optimization, as my system is fairly powerful. However, I have not had any performance issues at all, and no crashing either. However, it's running the exact same engine as Trackmania 2, so if you can run that, then you probably won't have any troubles running this!\n\nSadly, you cannot paint your car in a detailed way in this game (like in Trackmania 2). This, again, is because it is a spin off side game for consoles, that was also released on PC to keep us happy. I won't complain - they could have not released the game at all for PC.\n\nAll in all, this is a very solid fun game, and is worth picking up if you like fast-paced, skill based racing.\n\n\n\nFinal rating: 8/10 (two points lost for track complexity limit, this could have easily been disabled for PC!).","March 26","true","22.6"," 224 of 285 people (79%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","79","224","285","9","20"

The environments seem fun even though it's basically just the previous 3 environments plus a new one, but the COMPLETELY console focused gameplay ruins it, especially when playing the Rollercoaster Lagoon environment with keyboard instead of a controller. In addition to that the UPlay requirement completely disconnects TMT from the previous games, which means I can't really play with some of my old friends anymore.\n\nTrackmania Turbo takes a good chunk of what was fun in the previous parts and turns them into something that is barely any good. Customization is now limited to paintjobs only, and not even different paintjobs per environment. Thanks to Uplay you can't change your nickname in ways you could do it before, and stuff like horns, avatars, custom car models/skins are all gone. Dedicated servers are also gone, which means that servers (or rather lobbies) can only be hosted on Nadeo's services, giving the host barely any control over how the server works and also eliminates things like Dedimania.\n\nOverall Trackmania Turbo is really disappointing in a lot of aspects that made the Trackmania series so iconic and fun.\n\nAs a veteran, I am disappointed.\n\nBut since there is a demo out there, I'd recommend people to try it before making a choice on buying this game.\n\n=====================\nEdit: I'm gonna add some more stuff to my review since it has caused quite a discussion.\n\nThe main reason why I dislike Trackmania Turbo is because it leaves the existing Trackmania community behind, a lot of community driven features are not present in Turbo, the multiplayer doesn't allow for custom servers. The number one community feature just gets dropped for some lame-♥♥♥ wannabe server system, allowing for no customization at all, no jukebox, no plugins, no dedimania to compare your times against the world and the server itself. What is Trackmania without record-hunting? Leaderboards exist, yes, but they're practically useless.\n\nTurbo doesn't allow saving/editing replays for videos or exporting tracks to upload them on stuff like TMX, one of the community-heavy features that made Trackmania as big as it is today and effectively killing off those communities (for this game at least.)\n\nThe game itself is okay, but the fact that Nadeo disregards what made Trackmania such a success is simply outrageous.","March 24","false","1.7"," 527 of 746 people (71%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","71","527","746","10","37"

I have to give my opinion of this. Stated in other reviews below me this game is quite a dissapointment.\n\nFirst of all, like many have already pointed out, Lackluster customization. Basicly none if you ask me. Get a bunch of medals and earn some skin for your car that looks like ♥♥♥♥. even with the Uplay ''Legendary skins'' your car will look like ♥♥♥♥. Slap some stupid sticker on your car that you CANNOT place yourself.\n\n2nd. Where the absolute ♥♥♥♥ is the save recordings button? better yet, where the ♥♥♥♥ is the edit replay section? i love playing around in edit replay mode to try and capture some cool shots of me driving a map. Speaking of maps......\n\n3rd. Trackbuilder,,,,,Holy ♥♥♥♥♥. The amount of console peasantry in the trackbuilder is insane, the 1st thing you will notice when you enter this mode is that you have to move the blocks you want to place with the arrow keys.....like wtf? yes...this was advanced edit mode.\n\n4rd. Uplay. No further discussion needed.\n\n5. No dedicated servers. Speaks for itself. No customization on servers.\n\nIf you are looking for an arcade racer game to play for 30 mins to an hour. and not deal with anything else. Yea, go ahead and buy the game. However, if you are a previous TM fan and want to customize, edit replays etc....Stay away from this! Buy it when its on sale.","March 24","false","7.9"," 259 of 358 people (72%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","72","259","358","6","13"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/horns3447/recommended/375900/","horns3447","dennis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/horns3447/","162 products in account","This is a pretty hard review to make, because Trackmania Turbo really isn't a bad game at all. Nadeo did a great job at optimizing it, with even my potato managing a smooth 60 frames at lowest settings. The game still looks great, even with the options cranked down. It is nice to see that they made sure it would run on lower end computers. The aesthetic, while goofy at times, is still pleasing and definitely is welcome change up. They even managed to mostly hit the addictive nature of the series, with the "just a little faster" mentality really showing through. Unfortunately though, the game bleeds compromise.\n\nI don't want to be the type of person to say that devs should make their games exactly like the previous installments. Fans can really stop Devs from trying something new or creating a creative game from an existing title. Series that produce new games with only some new levels and a fresh coat of paint are walking a fine line. Racing games are hard to make creative sequels for though. There is only so much one can change in a racing game without compromising what makes the racing game unique. Nadeo did a good job with Trackmania 2, changing up the pace a bit with a rally mode, among other things. Turbo though, appears to completely changed up some core concepts of Trackmania to an unwelcoming degree.\n\nAlot of the fun came from Trackmania's extremely unique take on racing. The cars where responsive to an unrealistic degree, and gripped the track like a magnet. The challenge, especially in later levels, would be maintaining speed in an increasing chaotic and cramped track. You had all the tools though to floor it, the question was did you have the skill. It was an idealized version of racing, where cars never skidded out, and one could restart at the push of a button. Wanted to go 600 kmh on a completely vertical curved portion of a wall? Why not? I have yet to play a game that approaches driving exactly the way Trackmania does.\n\nTurbo appears to have gone the route of its contemporaries though, and features a more realistic idea of driving. The cars have weight, and will do more normal car things. In doing this, they have made the game feel less precise. It is not to the level of weight of Need for Speed or Burnout have, but appears to be a mix of these games and classic Trackmania. It feels more precise than alot of it's rivals, but, unfortunately, is kinda easy like them as well, and has mechanics that could have been approached in a more Trackmania way. For example; I don't mind added blatant drifting to the game, but here it is incredibly simple. I expect a technique that allows one to cut off such large amounts of time to be a challenge to pull off, but it isn't at all. In the previous games drifting was difficult to control, and would only save time if one really understood how it worked. Here it seems to be thrown in because it is expected, or because it looks cool, not really to be an advanced technique to help one on the quest for the shinnies.\n\nThis kinda sums up the game though. It is simply a gentrification of an already established series. Past installments have been completely community run. Nadeo lays out the frame work, and the community goes nuts. Here though, with the addition to a console port, Ubisoft has appeared to have forced Nadeo to turn it into every other game, with mechanics vaguely reminiscent of past titles, but mostly missing the mark. The car customization is laughable, and really doesn't feel like you are being creative in the slightest. The lack of community servers is sad, and even pc ports of other console games often have this. It has lost the community driven attitude of the past games, with only the track editor really remaining. Every decision has appeared to make the game more generic, to entice more people to try out the series. Only when one stops to sit though does one wonder why it was done in the first place. Why is there a random track option? It is a neat concept, but the tracks end up feeling imprecise and not very satisfying. Couldn't this time and money have been spent on something better. Apparently no\n\nEvery new feature or mechanic seems like a ploy by Ubisolf to entice more fans, but all seem to really lack depth. Am I going to spend more than five minutes with a friend on the two controllers one car mode? Probably not. I would rather race them one on one instead. It is amazing how long the last games have lasted with only a (admittingly amazing) track editor and community servers options. Here though, not only have they added a bunch of gimmicky features, but also made the game feel less skill based and more generic.\n\nIt isn't a bad game. There is nothing wrong with pretty racing games that make you feel like you are going a million miles an hour and that have drifting that make you feel like Ken Block. But to not only lower the skill ceiling of one of the hardest racing games out there, but to also completely change its focus from community driven to something else is sad. I suppose it was inevitable, with Ubisoft being the publisher and whatnot, but it is still a disappointment to see.\n\nThis is all coming from the perspective of a fan though. To those who haven't played or haven't enjoyed past Trackmania games, you should defiantly give it a go. It has fast racing, a great sense of speed, an addictive time trail mode, and gorgous visuals. To those expecting a new Trackmania game though, look elsewhere.\n","March 24","false","1.3"," 160 of 212 people (75%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","75","160","212","5","4"

It's fast, it's difficult, it's technical, and it's crazy fun.\n\nPros:\n-New environment (Lagoon Rollercoaster) feels like a remake of the Snow environment from TMUF, and it looks amazing\n-Completely updated UI (It looks fantastic now. There are no 'janky' looking default font text labels popping up on the screen.\n-Cool new art direction (All of the signage, scenery objects that are present in all environments)\n-Unified gameplay experience (No need to close the game and open another just to play a different environment)\n-Double Driver is a really fun new multiplayer mode\n-New parts and smoother gameplay for existing environments\n-Huge singleplayer campaign\n\nCons:\n-From what I can tell, you can't save or edit your replays at this point. I hope this is either a planned or accidentally hidden feature.\n-Less customization than previous Trackmania games (for example, no custom car models)*\n*This might not really be a bad thing. I personally prefer the more coherent art style that this forces.\n-You can't reassign controller inputs. The default layout is okay, but I'd prefer using the right analog stick for acceleration and brake (the default layout maps it to nothing at all).\n\n\nShould you buy it?\n-It's not an essential purchase if you are already invested in TM2, or if you prefer the deep customization of TM2.\nIf you're looking to get into Trackmania, or if you want a more unified experience, this game is worth getting. Despite the bad reviews, this game is highly appealing and very fun in my opinion, and I think you'll have fun with it too.

The gameplay remained the same and has even been improved in some aspects, while some restrictions have been applied that ultimately don't make the game less fun, no matter how much the community may want to tell you otherwise. The new of the four enviroments, Lagoon, is awesome. Simply said, it is a streamlined trackmania game that kept all the fun parts and threw out the unnecessary ones - like lean meat that is still delicious. Don't listen to the others, buy it if you are interested in Trackmania.\n\nLong version:\n\nI must say, I am very disappointed. No, not in the game - in the reviews.\n\nI should first say that I have been playing trackmania for a long time - since around 2008, both online and offline, on LAN's and even one tournament.\n\nThere are a lot of "supposedly" Trackmania-Veterans giving reviews here, thumbing the game down. They say that it sucks that the game has a lot less costumization compared to the other Trackmania games. They say it sucks that there are no dedicated servers. They say it sucks that the limit is now 100 players per server. They say that because of all of those reasons, it is a bad game. None of those reasons, none of those reviews, talk about the game itself. Why? It is great. And that the customization is gone is so bad?\n\nI say, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. This was never what made Trackmania a great game. Sure, it was neat to customize your name and car in great detail, import new models, honks and even SFX, track graphics - all of that is gone now. And it has a reason it is gone - this is not supposed to be a successor to the old Trackmania games. It is it's own game, simply because it got a console release at the same time - it isn't connected to Maniaplanet, so that means a new community will form that is supposed to span consoles too.\n\nYes, it sucks that a lot of community features are gone, but what does it matter? What makes Trackmania great - always has and always will - is the GAMEPLAY. And the gameplay is top notch. Racing online or offline is fun, fast, fluid and feels even more improved than it already has in the previous trackmania games. The trackbuilder is as varied and versatile as ever, allowing you to make some great creations and upload them for everyone to play. 4 Enviroments are there - Canyon, Valley, Lagoon and Stadium, all with different properties that require you to learn them and, even more than that, learn how your car behaves. The game is - simply - fun. Online play, even without dedicated servers, is still great - especially if you go to a server that plays random maps (the random trackbuilder isn't that great most of the time but it does provide some laughs and - most importantly - a somewhat even playing field. Still, Trackmania is and always has been about skill no matter what.) All of these negative reviews drive people away from what would otherwise be a great game - just because of Uplay and because the customization is largely gone? (You can still choose how your car looks and the choices aren't even that bad - the more gold medals you unlock, the more choices you have.)\n\nAnd this is what is funny to me. For years now Trackmania-Veterans have complained about the lack of players. They wanted a game that could bring new people into the trackmania series and provide them with an entry point, considering that most of the other Trackmania games have been seperately sold based on enviroment, aside from United (Trackmania Valley, Trackmania Canyon...). THIS GAME IS AN ENTRY POINT. And what do they reply? "Oh no, it is too dumbed down, so much stuff is missing bla bla bla" Stuff that only matters to someone who DOES NOT KNOW WHAT TRACKMANIA IS ABOUT. In the process, they drive players away. And then they start complaining again, about how Trackmania doesn't have enough players.\n\nThis is a great game. Buy it. If you are new to Trackmania, you will love it and I urge you to also try the older games. If you are a veteran, buy it anyway. A lot of the customization is gone and the game as a whole feels more streamlined - but THAT IS OKAY. It is not supposed to be a successor to the PC-trackmanias. It is it's own game. And what made trackmania great, the gameplay, the fast and fluid racing, the surprising courses by the community - all that is there and it looks better than ever. All that has changed is that you can't assault people with customized "Let the bodies hit the floor" Honks or race around with your ♥♥♥♥ing Hatsune-Miku painted car. If this is all that ever mattered to the community, then well - maybe this community isn't as welcoming as they would always want to be. But this is it's own game, it's own community. It is up to you to shape it to become less elitist than the old one.\n\nIt does everything it needs to well. The only negative point I can see is Uplay and even so - Uplay isn't as bad as a lot of people may want you to believe, though I do agree it is useless in this context, considering this game is sold on Steam. And while I do not absolutely love Uplay - let's be honest, it is okay. Just okay though.","March 25","true","13.7"," 184 of 261 people (70%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","70","184","261","9","8"

(This is mostly aimed to new players to the Trackmania series)\n\n-First and foremost, the game is really fun\n-New Double Driver mode\n-New Stunt mode\n-You can create challenges and publish them for the world to see\n-As an arcade game, Turbo is really easy for anyone to get into it and have fun, but its gameplay also has depth, so the possibilities are almost infinity and it will take you a long time to master the gameplay of each environment\n-3 environments already known in the series and 1 brand new environment called 'Rollercoaster Lagoon', each one with an unique and original gameplay mechanics\n-Hundreds of campaign tracks made by Nadeo\n-You can create your own tracks with 4 different editors (each one with a different 'complexity level')\n-The game's 'art style' is really amazing, everything is colorful and vivid, it makes you feel like the world around you is really alive, especially in the Stadium environment that in my opinion is the comfiest of them all. Sometimes I play the game just to look at the visuals\n-The game is really well optimized and runs on any toaster\n\n\nWhy shouldn't you buy this game? (This is mostly aimed to old Trackmania players)\n\n-Can't create dedicated servers with custom plugins\n-No Dedimania, so there is no way (in-game) to compare you time against the top players' times\n-The powerful 'Classic' Trackbuilder doesn't support controllers\n-I can't 'take down' or 'erase' the challenges I've have published, once a challenge it's up it stays in the cloud forever\n-Very limited graphics options (in-game and in the launcher). For instance, I can't disable only the annoying bloom without lowering all other shader effects along with it\n-You can't rename the tracks you've created\n-Scrolling up and down on the leaderboards during a race is really clunky\n-Can't see more than a few cars in the track at once (while in TM2 you could see more than a 100 cars)\n-The opposite of the complaint above, you can't turn other players' ghosts off (some people like seeing other cars but some people don't, especially if you are in competitive server)\n-No 3D custom skins\n-No custom nickname (hexadecimal colors, bold, etc)\n-No custom horn\n-Horrible console UI\n-Unnecessary Uplay requirement\n\n-Can't remap controller input (They fixed this with a patch, but at the launch this feature was not present)\n-Still no XInput support for the triggers (They fixed this with a patch, but at the launch this feature was not present)","April 19","true","134.0"," 36 of 44 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","36","44","0","2"

You can't name your tracks, they get numbered by the game and that's it. You can't really manage uploaded tracks... no way to delete or change once uploaded. All you can do is to edit a copy and upload a new version.\n\nStill not too bad and i may be able to live with that, but then they decided that there should not be dedicated servers.... You got a room where you can add tracks and change some basic settings, but you have to actively play in there or at least 1 player sitting in there (once you've launched it) or the room will be shut down until you launch it again.\n\nAnd last but not least the track sharing. No sort by 'rating' or 'times played', just a vast sea of randomly numbered tracks with a tiny picture which may or may not give some insight into the track. Ok, you can filter/sort by 'environment', 'style', 'length' and 'time uploaded' or 'latest played'... kinda helpful if you keep in mind how many tracks are uploaded/played per hour, isn't it?\n... If only the rating thingy wont be quite useless! Why? Well, at the end of each race there will be a rating. There are 3 options: like, skip, dislike. Somehow the game decides on its own which one will be selected by default and the player has like 3 seconds to change the selection. Nice, at the very moment right after the pure action, where most players lean back and chill for a few seconds, the rating happens and the game decides which vote will happen by default if there is no player input... so most of the votes are made by nadeo - well done!\n\nTMT could have really been an awesome follow-up, but the devs cut off so many things that it's nothing else than a huge disappointment in the end.","April 2","false","31.6"," 56 of 78 people (72%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","72","56","78","6","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/theisos/recommended/375900/","theisos","Theisos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/theisos/","172 products in account","There’s a terrible bias in many of the reviews posted so far. I felt inclined to post my own review to cater to people who may not have a problem with Uplay or Ubisoft. This is largely because real downsides in the game’s design are being completely ignored. Uplay has very rarely caused me problems. Some of the more recent updates to Uplay have made it less “intrusive.” If you already have a Uplay account and other newer Ubisoft games, then there’s absolutely nothing to worry about when it comes to Uplay.\n\nShould you buy this game if you are a long time player of Trackmania games? That’s exactly what I did. I’ve been playing different versions of Trackmania for years. My experience with the game is probably different from many PC gamers. I played this game primarily in a couch co-op/party play type of setting with friends. Single player and internet play was something I barely touched during the years that I’ve played previous Trackmania titles. Playing with friends in the same room meant playing hot seat. I’ve played countless hours of incredibly entertaining Trackmania hot seat over the years. My Trackmania gaming experience was based on speed, precision (taking inches off corners) and friendly but aggressive competition. I’ve never not had a version of this game installed somewhere. Does Trackmania Turbo deliver that same experience? Yes. Does it add to that experience? Yes.\n\nWe now have track and vehicle types that change the way you need to drive because of the handling and terrain combination. This is great because it adds a certain kind of “variety” to the racing. We also have split screen and different multiplayer modes. The new multiplayer modes are where I think the execution was faulty. Modes like “mono screen” are hidden until you provide button codes to activate them. What you can immediately infer is that you’re left to understanding the modes yourself. How do I perform stunts or battle my friends? How do I mix modes up? None of this is immediately obvious. Getting the full hot seat playability out of the game is, unfortunately, a challenge. I fail to see why the game was designed this way. Wouldn't it have been wiser to fully open the local multiplayer modes of the game and provide enough information for us to immediately jump into playing?\n\nI can't comment on the difference between the single player and online experience between this game and past games but I can say that the single player is fun and challenging; it is exactly what I expected from Trackmania and more.","March 25","true","21.9"," 63 of 100 people (63%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","63","63","100","3","0"

It's not even close to as good as Stadium or Canyon.\n\nDefinitely not worth AAA money. Get it on sale.\n\n14 hours in:\n\nI hate Valley with a passion. Controlling the car on dirt is really difficult and most of the time you are fighting the car, not the track. When you initiate a turn it jerks a lot, and it's really difficult to straighten it up and keep it on the line you want.\n\nThe multiplayer aspect of the game became boring really quickly, because the populated servers host the same campaign maps over and over, that are not that great anyway.\n\nThe custom maps are available through a "Worldwide Challenges" menu where you can find a list of tracks that are built by other people. I haven't tried it out yet, but I have a hunch that the good maps will be burried deep in piles of amateur ... stuff.\n\nGoing to the campaign, I played up to track #96 and got gold on all so far. The campaign has some nice and fun tracks, but I'd say most of them are average and forgettable so far.\n\nWhat really turns me off in the campaign is the fact that you need to play all environments to advance to the next difficulty level. This meant that instead of playing environments that I love I spent most of the time trying to beat Valley maps. I did insist to get gold on all of them because I thought maybe I hate Valley because I suck at it. I didn't find the fun in it so far, and I am ready to give up.\n\nRegarding the pathetic argument that this game was made for consoles and we should give it some slack.. Ha! They can do whatever they want on consoles, but I was sold a PC game for 40 euro and I am reviewing it like it is. There are other PC games out there that give you a lot more value for less than 40 euro.","March 24","false","33.7"," 29 of 40 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","29","40","0","0"

Dicksmack","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatfemaledog/","654 products in account","NOTE: NADEO HAS SAID THEY WILL BE BRINGING THE NEW ENVIRONMENT, LAGOON, TO TRACKMANIA 2.\n\nBUYER BEWARE: This is a game that, although will feel very familar to Trackmania fans, will not be all that welcoming to them. Buy with the knowledge that this is TM2's Canyon, Valley, and Stadium with one new environment/playstyle, but is ultimately lacking in moddable freedom. Although I give it a "Not Recommended," I solely mean that speaking as a TM for veteran TM players. It is not a bad title, and if the lack of modding/dedicated servers doesn't bother you, please pick this up.\n\nLet me get this out of the way. Do not be fooled, Trackmania Turbo is a fantastic title. The core gameplay has been refined and tuned significantly. The sense of speed is superb, the driving feels so much better, and the graphics are really beautiful. But, where it shines in a lot of areas, it fails everywhere else.\n\nIf you're at all familiar to the previous generations of Trackmania then you'll know the following: Trackmania is a content sharing game. Trackmania has always been about dedicated servers where people can upload music tracks, plugins, add custom made community levels, and had a huge modding community primarily for custom car models and skin designs. Trackmania allowed people to have their own unique personality online. There was even an in-game paint editor if you weren't savvy enough to understand editing skins in Photoshop.\n\nTRACKMANIA TURBO DOESN'T FEATURE ANY OF THIS ASIDE FROM THE TRACK EDITOR. AND THE TRACK EDITOR DOESN'T WORK WITHOUT A CONTROLLER.\n\nAnd, to be fair, I don't want to say Nadeo doesn't care. This game was pretty much their big introduction to the console scene as their last attempt with the Wii game didn't go so well. When it comes to consoles dedicated servers are never a thing due to Sony/Xbox having gripes about that sorta thing. It should go without saying too that content-sharing custom content wouldn't be possible on the console without making an entire in-game editor as complex as Forza or APB. As a way to still keep the customization a thing, there are a ton of liveries, sponsor emblems, numbers, flags, and metal trimmings you can unlock to customize your stock car. It would appear Nadeo didn't want to completely alienate PC players from a newer installment, but subsquently didn't want to make one version be the "superior" version. This is further backed up by Nadeo saying they are going to add Turbo's newest environemnt, Lagoon, into TM2. The community admin for this forum has also claimed that Turbo should not be treated as TM3 as they are completely different expierences.\n\nI can't say much about the new game modes but, as it stands, this is not meant for die hard trackmania fans. Yes, custom tracks can still be shared and played. Yes, the gameplay is incredibly refined from TM2 and is, in my opinion, much more fun to play. The only issue is that the content PC players are used to isn't there, and it makes sense why it isn't. It doesn't necessarily mean it's a bad game though. If you're looking for a more streamlined experience where you're less likely to play horrible maps with a community that is much more active than TM2 is right now then do pick this up. It's still a great game... even if it is just Valley/Canyon/Stadium packaged together with a new environement.","March 24","false","20.5"," 53 of 84 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","53","84","0","0"

Bought it before it came out and when the release happened, my first impressions wasn't really great about it. First the Ubisoft-Connection Problem. When the game don't pop up properly, i solved it, when you clear your verify cache on TM Turbo (Library-->TM Turbo-->Rightclick-->Properties-->Local Files-->Verify Cache)\n\nPro;\nSo about the game itself. It has a very nice campagn with nice tracks. The developers did a great job on the level design. It exists a lot of different tracks. Sometimes you drive on standard racing, sand/island-, rollercoaster-, mountain and grass tracks etc. The graphic/racing flow through the game is pretty amazing and stunning and has for me a long time potential to play this game. The multiplayer went fine - no lags, fast loading.\n\nContra;\nYou can't change your nick or colour them out, like in other TM Games. The players name how is registered on your ubisoft acc is your ingame players name too. In the multiplayer you can't turn other player cars off (or does anyone know how to vanish them? Would be great if there is a solution about this, because it's annoying as f***. Sometimes i think i drive on ice and is in my opinion not 100% sturdily, i think this was better done in TM 2 Stadium. the last thing is about this second textchat ingame, they integrated. Why? Why you need a second textchat if you can write on the standard textchat with other players? This is only good for spaming, nothing else.\n\nOverall i would say, if you like racing games, then this is a must have. Yeah it has a lot of negative aspects, but on the whole concept, Nadeo did a really great game here and know that they wouldn't disappoint me. If you are not sure about the purchase, then wait till its on %sale.\n\nRating; 85/100","March 28","true","36.6"," 38 of 61 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","38","61","0","0"

Along comes the pc port of a console port of a pc game. Stripped from proper replay saving and broken replay editing*. No costum cars and skins. No dedicated servers. No leaderboards. No Mixmapping. You can't even name your own f*cking map. You like stadium and want to play through those in the campaign first? Too bad, play through these 30 other maps first.\n\nStunt mode is really fun and gives you a new type of gameplay where you have to do tricks between jumps to get boost. But.. why the f*ck can't you enable it in the mapmaker so you can make maps for it????\n\nCore gameplay is still the same, which is the only reason why I give this review a thumbs up.\nI tried this game with a ps3 controller and it opened a new world for me. I've ben playing valley since its launch and disliked the controls, but after a retry with a controller, I really enjoy it now.\nI've spent around 20 hrs playing the campaign, which is the most time I've spent on any campaign yet. Im on #43, trying to get trackmaster medal on all.The maps are really well done and artwork and scenery around them is very cool. F*ck multilaps.\n\n\n*When trying to save replays online with other players I cant even get to save my own replay. I drove wr on a track and wanted to save the replay. What I got in the mediatracker was 5 guys copypasted 11 times all over the timeline.\nThere is no way to open multiple replays (except importing replays one by one, which is a pain in the ♥♥♥ if I want to import 1000+ replays) and they removed the feature to record ghosts inside the mediatracker.\nWhen finishing a map in solo play you need to finish the map, try it again and press R to save the replay.

Turbo knows what it is, and it handles it's purpose as a time trial game exceedingly well. However, Trackmania Turbo DOES have enough flaws that makes it hard to recommend to veterans of the series.\n\nThe biggest thing is the way the cars handle. The enviornment that feels the best is probably Canyon; the cars in Canyon feel a bit heavier than in TM2 but they still retain their fun drift physics. That part of the game feels great. It's just a little less responsive, unfortunately. Likewise, the Stadium cars feel heavier and less responsive as well, and considering how popular Stadium is I think they should have left it alone. In stark contrast, the Lagoon cars are twitchy as all hell and you can complete all of the White tracks without even touching the brakes once. The twitchiness would be ok, but the controller deadzone is incredibly small and there's no obvious way to change it. If you're trying to play Lagoon on keyboard, God help you. The worst of the bunch is Valley. Valley was unpopular in TM2, and it's still just as bad. Those cars have a stupidly wide turning radius until you gently tap the brakes, and then they suddenly have incredibly massive oversteer. And that's just on pavement; Valley cars control like pure crap on dirt, and there's a lot of dirt in Valley.\n\nThis wouldn't be nearly as bad if you could tackle one enviornment at a time, but you cant. First you do the 10 White tracks in Canyon, which unlocks the first 10 White tracks in Valley, and so on. Doing tracks in one enviornment should unlock more tracks in the same enviornment; that way, the player has time to really hone their skills in one before moving on to another. In Turbo, as soon as you get used to one enviornment, you have to move to another. It's not done very well.\n\nFurthermore, this is a REALLY lazy port. I know this is mainly a console game that's also seeing a PC release, but this is really sad coming from a developer that created originally Trackmania as a PC exclusive series. The options that you can change are almost as limited as Dark Souls. Visually, the game's pretty attractive, but I wish there was more that I could control.\n\nTl;dr, if you're a Trackmania veteran you're probably not going to like the changes that have been made to the existing enviornments. If you're a new player, you'll probably ge able to get used to it fairly quickly. Hopefully Nadeo turns their attention back to TM2 quickly, because I think I'm gonna pass on Turbo.","March 26","false","1.5"," 24 of 38 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","24","38","0","0"

Save yourself some money and buy Canyon and/or Stadium for $10 and $25 cheaper.\n\nI wrote more about it but that review seems to have disappeared so to summarize with the bad first (because the bad outweighs the good):\n\nThe Bad A nutered Canyon environment. It's as drifty as always, but feels significantly less zippy. I'm a 60k LP player with 140+ hours in Canyon and this new Canyon feels sluggish and not near as precice.\n\nI can't speak much to the other environments; however, the new Valley seemed reasonable, albeit hard as sin to control, and Rollercoaster was -far- too finicky feeling. Both I'm sure would be alright with practice, but overall they don't feel like unique or interesting iterations. I haven't played Stadium since TMN but it didn't feel great either.\n\nAn interface designed for TVs. I'm sure I'd get used to it, but there's also a lot of work they could do to improve the readability of important elements (like checkpoint splits)\n\nThe "or simply generate random [tracks]" makes tracks that don't really understand the mechanics of their environments\nThe Good Getting all four environments in one packages means hopefully Valley and Lagoon will see more multiplayer attention.\n\nMultiplayer really isn't that bad. I don't care how the servers are implemented because the to most players the functionality is exactly what you'd expect from TM2. Sparse at the moment, but that will change as people make and port tracks.\n\nThe campaign mode feels pretty good. I just wanted to get into multiplayer, but I enjoyed my time with it.\nThe Just Alright Excellent graphical fidelity, but the catch-22 of racing games is if you're playing well you don't have time to smell the roses. However, it doesn't sacrifice readability in most cases so it's not a downside by any means.\nVerdictThere's nothing in TMT that is done better than TM2 that justifies the price. Even people who don't already own TM2 might as well pick it up instead. Canyon and Stadium are all anyone plays to begin with and together they're $10 cheaper than TMT and you get a much better PC experience to boot.","March 24","false","1.0"," 84 of 150 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","84","150","2","3"

Offline Campaign as solo gamemode with 200 tracks to master and a brand new "DoubleDriver" mode, where you team up with a friend to both drive a single car!\nMultiplayer allows you to race against up to 99 other players, on a track playlist of your choice.\nNew environment Lagoon push the craziness of TM even further, with it's rollercoaster tracks, where cars can litterally defies gravity.\n\nTrackbuilder is also still here (It won't be TM if it don't have it). At first, you'll load the console focused version of the builder, just move your mouse at the top of the screen, click on the little gear and then select "classic trackbuilder".\nMaking tracks is still easy and fun, there's a lot of new blocks to discovers AND, if you loaded the classic builder, MediaTracker is still here! :)\nThere's also a new "Track generator", where the game build tracks by itself! I still haven't tried it though, but people says it kinda work well.\n\nAs I said earlier, painter is gone. You can still customise your vehicle, but this time by selecting different layers and presets (that you have to unlock by playing the solo campaign), paint also apply to every car at the same time, no unique design for each one, exept Stadium car, which design will only be based on the chosen country flag.\nCustom horns and models are also gone, it's not a major issue, but still another cool feature that disapeared.\nReplay editor is still here (to find it, it's like classic trackbuilder, but it's in the main menu :) ) but so far, I still don't know how to save a replay and if there's a way to do it.\n\nMultiplayer is freaking solid as always, but no dedicated servers this time: Players have to open rooms hosted on Nadeo servers.\nNo more online ladder btw, now it's a lvl up system.\n\nLast thing I want to talk about: controls. Divided in two parts.\n\n- Road controls: They are near perfect, only Lagoon is a bit too sensitive (playing with a gamepad feels like playing with a keyboard) but once you get used to it, it's really enjoyable. Drifting in Canyon is satisfying, while drifting in Valley is a little bit harder to control. Stadium is really great to drive as always.\n\n- Offroad controls: Here's where frustration comes in... While Stadium have a great offroad (feels a bit different than Nation, but still perfectly playable), and Canyon being okay (there's not many offroad parts btw), Valley and Lagoon are... UGH. Car wheels instantly transform into soaps, and it become insanely hard to control. You can still get used to it, but there is one thing that will bring you frustration every single time: trying to stabilize your vehicle at the end of a drift. It's nearly impossible unless you get the perfect trajectory, and I'm playing with a gamepad... Also, keeping your vehicle in position during a loop is a challenge too, and losing controls of your car in the middle of it will happen often (only Stadium and Lagoon rollercoaster loops are exeptions)\n\nOverall, Trackmania Turbo is a good game, the biggest black point is mainly the offroad controls and loop physics that kill the fun (would be really nice if they could make them better). It's also sad to see a lot of customisation features gone, but it's not affecting gameplay. If you are searching for a good racing game, with crazy tracks and great multiplayer, go for it!\n\nSeriously, it's great. Just not as great as it used to be...\n\nps: if you're still not sure about buying it or not, you can still go download Nation Forever, it's only original Stadium, but it's FREE and have all the features that are missing in Turbo :)","March 27","true","21.0"," 37 of 67 people (55%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","55","37","67","5","3"

The controls are very smooth and fluid and the graphics just blow me away. However, as a big fan of being able to create my own tracks, I must say that i am completely infuriated. The game just before this is the series had a great level design, so why not just keep that? The trackbuilder tool in this game is obviously meant to be used with a gamepad. That, of course would not be terrible in and of itself unless you take into account that the controls are absolutely abysmal. You are forced to go back and forth from using just the mouse to just the keyboard over and over, and the entire thing has a lack luster "tutorial," that tells you just about nothing. I tried my best to have any kind of enjoyment when using the trackbuilder tool but there was just no way. The track builder tool is a HUGE part of this game and is a big attraction for many people, especially on PC where customization is your best friend, and anyone who is looking forwards to this game for that, is going to be completely heartbroken.

No name changes, no car horns, no custom models. They did this to clean up the game, not make it more boring, and people don't seem to realize that too much. I like this game, personally. It feels like trackmania. It looks like it. The tracks want to devour your soul like the old games. Trackmania is the one game series that brings true frustration into my life when it comes to gaming and I commend it for that.\n\nPros:\n+4 worlds, 200 tracks\n+Decent variety in tracks, environments are different enough to be distinct\n+Despite no model changes, lots of paints and you unlock more for being better\n+People are still having custom names somehow, so I don't see the problem\n+Very pretty graphics.\n\nCons:\n-My Nvidia Shield controller isn't compatible. Kind of a disappointment.\n-Because of this, tracks are HARD. I'm stuck on the black series because I can't perfectly molest my keyboard to do the track like if I had a controller.\n-Track builder is kind of complicated. It always has been to me though because I'm an idiot. :^)\n-Despite a lot of patterns for cars, there's still not too many. It's about 10 predetermined patterns recolored in different ways. Decals and numbers still have a lot of variety.\n\nMy conclusion: I give this game an 8/10.

While Uplay implementation is still definitely reason enough in itself for me to give a game a bad rating, it isn't the final nail in the coffin in this case.\n\nWhat irks me is the deceptive way it was marketed. Sure, one could definitely make the arguement that they didn't technically lie to consumers. But failing to address things or make things clear is equally bad. In this case, they were absolutely 100% correct about the game including a double-driver mode and an automatic track builder among other new features. But what they failed to address and/or make clear was the exclusion of many essential TrackMania elements, such as the experimental track builder tools and (I'm 100% not joking about this) the ability to name your tracks among other things.\n\nIf they were clear and upfront about the exclusion of these features prior to release, I most likely would have still bought the game and had fun with it, regardless of the excluded features and how much of an unmitigated disaster the Lagoon environment is.

Their first major hit 'Trackmania Nations' was free to play, and played by hundreds of thousands of people simultaneously worldwide. A combination of Trackmania 2 being divided by gameplay type (canyon, valley, stadium) and the games no longer being free to play started to harm the games reputation - the playerbase was dwindling, as fans were so divided amongst several versions of the game, they all appeared to be dead. Trackmania Turbo aims to fix that.\n\nFirst and foremost, this game has uPlay and requires a separate account. You can't escape this, even the console version asks you to register and use an account separate from your PSN/XBL ID. It's not really worth complaining about in this context as equal effort is required no matter your platform of choice.\n\nAs far as PC options go, it's barebones and actually quite bad in a few instances. True fullscreen mode is hit or miss; enabling it on my PC shows the interface at the correct aspect ratio, but 3d elements of the game are rendered in 4:3 then stretched to 16:9, which looks awful, as are the the uplay and steam overlays. Getting a proper 16:9 ratio required that I played the game in borderless window mode. There are no options to change your controller bindings, and detection of xinput pads can be spotty, too - my Xbox 360 controller is detected by the game, but actually operates in Dinput mode, which means only the right or left trigger can be active at any given time. They are detected as the same axis. For drifting and braking, this requires me to rely on tapping 'A' to initiate a drift, and I must fully release the right trigger to brake at all. Graphics options are equally barebone, and setting the water to 'highest' actually causes graphical defects.\n\nHowever, these are elements that can be worked around - using a different controller (such as a DS4 or Xbox One controller) properly detects and uses Xinput functionality, allowing you to hold the right trigger to accelerate and tap the left trigger to initiate a drift just like you can on the consoles. Once you're logged into uPlay, you can set it to remember your credentials and you'll never have to think about it again. Playing in borderless window mode is indistinguishable from fullscreen mode and as an added bonus, eliminates screen tearing without having to enable vsync, plus you can alt tab quickly from the game. Graphically speaking, the game is on par with the console versions even at the medium settings, and seems to be optimized well - my modest rig can easily run the game at 60+fps. Patches are reportedly on the way to fix issues with controllers.\n\nI won't get too in-depth on how this game compares to previous titles, because frankly, as Nations went on, the dedicated servers and level of customization available to players converted the interface into a huge mess, and the maps you could race on became less fun to a casual player over time, as the diehard fans demanded more difficult, puzzle-like maps to play on.\n\nWhat you get here is a 200 map-strong campaign, spread across 4 unique playstyles. Each car handles very differently, and for the first time in the series, each mode is truly united - the interface seamlessly transitions you from environment to environment, because they are all actually part of a single game, an improvement over previous entries in the series. You can join a server that runs maps from multiple environments, also a first for the series.\n\nThe game is very fast paced and has many arcade qualities to it. One perk of playing on PC is dramatically improved loading times - my time on the beta and later on, the demo for the PS4, had me waiting upwards of 25 seconds to load into a new map. Installing this game to an SSD on my PC has reduced that time to a mere 7 seconds, and i'm operating on a lower end SSD, too. The controls are responsive, and there's no stuttering or wait times to restart the entire map or from your previous checkpoint. There are per-map and overall rankings divided into multiple sections, allowing you to see how you measure up to the world, your country, and even down to the state level. Aiming for gold is just the beginning - the game makes it very clear to you how you measure up, and the small nature of each track encourages you to keep trying until you achieve trackmaster (a hidden ranking beyond gold) or become one of the best players in your region.\n\nTaking the game online allows you to filter servers down to something you can enjoy, and you race against real-time ghosts of up to 99 others on the server. It feels good to know exactly how you stack up against others not only on a world/country/state level, but how you fare against others in a more intimate, competitive environment that demands consistently good performance out of you. It's nice to be able to witness how others take on the course, too. A current problem lies in how the servers are handled, though - since they're hosted by the developers, there's currently no easy way for you to make a track and share it with others. Reportedly, they're working on a fix for this, but in the mean time, you still have 200 official maps to occupy yourself with.\n\nI personally believe the game is very fun, and lives up to the Trackmania name. This game represents the best opportunity for the entire community to come together and settle on a single game. Many of the complaints you'll see in the other reviews are valid, but overblown. The worst problems very quickly move out of your way and aren't really a issue anymore, beyond the games initial setup.","March 26","true","6.6"," 15 of 28 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","15","28","0","1"

However I bit the bullet and decided I would overlook uPlay because I'm a huge long term TrackMania fan and I'd hate myself if I didn't atleast give it a fair chance, and am I glad I did. As Turbo did not disapoint.\n\nPositivesIf you have a love for the TrackMania series then you will feel right at home playing turbo, as essentially it is just the whole series bundled into one TrackMania with the addition of rollercoaster environment.\n\nExcellent music, I don't usually use in-game music for any game however the flow of the music and choice of music fits perfectly into the game.\n\nDouble Driver mode is a whole lot of fun if you have a buddy to do it with, and is a very intresting twist on the whole game and opens up a whole new world of entertainment value for Turbo from previous Trackmania Titles.\n\nKeeps with the origional Trackmania track creator and add a few extra features and functionality to the Track Builder such as a random track, which will literally randomly put pieces together to form a functional track, to which you can tweak. This is mostly a gimmick to those confertable with Track building however it will allow much easier entry into the Track building side of things. As some people find it easier to tweak and add than the build from scratch.NegativesRequires uplay to play. though I haven't personally ran into an issue with uplay and Trackmania Turbo, uplay is infamous for causing lots of problems when trying to access games, activate games, log in, always being online etc. So depending how strongly you hate uplay this may be a turn off.\nThe customizability of cars was changed from freepaining your car in an MS paint style to selecting presets for different aspects, changing material, paint job, numbers, details and flags. This could be seen as a positive point for some people, however for me I liked the MS paint style of painting cars, as it mean for more unique and personal paintjobs. Summary\nIf you're a fan of TM Canyon, TM Valley and TM Stadium then TM Turbo is a must have and a steal for value as you essentially get TM Canyon, TM Valley, TM Stadium and newly added TM Lagoon, with new tracks to run and new records to smash.","March 24","true","6.7"," 51 of 100 people (51%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","51","51","100","5","2"

I did my own testing. Both solo, multiplayer (very little) and local multi with friends.\nLike many I played since the very first TM, and the Turbo was an early purchase because i knew it would be fun and refreshing.\n\nFirst of all, please stop with these "1hour played" and "i want a refund". The reasons given are not important enough, it's all tiny ones that'll be fix soon. It's been the same people making the game since the very first, and i have hope they will listen to us and provide fixes and solutions.\nI've been reading a lot of complains about controls, i had none. But i understand it can be frustrating not to be able to customize them.\nHorn? I didn't notice, but indeed it should be an easy fix.\nTwo cameras ? Yeah... that could be improved as well!!\nAll these things are very minors though, and could be fixed in one single patch.\n\nQuick note about local multiplayer. Because from the video i had hope of having a new micro machine type of game... no it's not. It's quickly messy, and if a players skill are too different, the game won't be fun anymore.\nUnlike the solo campaign, you can't have any sort of continuity in the game such as "next track", and you have each time to exit and select a new track... simple stuff to fix !!\nThe two players in one car is original and fun.\nBut afterall, we ended up playing hot seat. One after the other to have the whole screen for ourselves.\n\nSomething else now that i haven't been reading anywhere, is the gameplay itself.\nWe now have 4 environnements to play with, each with different cars and roads and grips. They are fun to drive, and the small differences between them makes it interesting.\nBut.\nTo be honest, they all pretty much very similar and come to handling high speed. There is no more of that technique you could find in the first one, with the snow level for example or the mediterranean one; where the challenge wasn't so much the speed and fast tracks but more towards the specificity of how the car was behaving.\nAnd now i feel like all the different cars have come to the same thing: too much speed.\nMaybe it's what made the game famous and fun, but i think they should have put a slower one in the middle to have some variations in gameplay, and more challenges for gamers. See my picture profile ? I need glasses and i'm getting too old for such speed!\n\nAh anyway, in summary:\n\nPROS:\n- Lot of content in Solo\n- Inifinite content thanks to editor\n- multiplayer looks stable\n- interface is simple and nice to use\n- nice to have split screen\n- funny and interesting two drivers seat\n- sound, atmosphere & graphics\n\nCONS:\n- lack of variations in gameplay between cars. They're fun to drive, but repetitive\n- messy one-screen mode micromachine-like\n- local multi lacking of queue/playlist option\n- No horn they said\n- uplay... :( (although it's fairly straight forward and not annoying too much)\n\nIf they'd fix all the little annoyance, the game would be perfectly recommendable.\nIn any case, i'll keep playing and beat times against friends, and see how bad i am in my hometown ranking :)\n\nHave a good one","March 25","true","5.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Its results suck, and it doesn't seem to have any intelligent design programmed in at all.\n\nThe one positive thing I can say is that the UI looks gorgeous. Should you buy this game though? No.\n\nEDIT: I found out the classic track editor is in the game, just a bit hidden. By moving the cursor to the top-right in the editor you can switch - I'm not sure why they wouldn't just make it the default, or at least let you choose it in the menu where you choose which editor you want.\n\nThis brings every trackbuilder's experience with this game up by a lot, given how much more convenient it is to use. However, you will still be underwhelmed with the lack of customizability if you've been used to older TM games, so I still recommend waiting for Lagoon to be released on TM2 over getting this game.","March 31","false","53.8"," 11 of 21 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","11","21","0","0"

It's disappointing that Turbo lacks this, but nevertheless I'm already enjoying it more than TM2. TM2's obtuse "Maniaplanet" interface was a huge obstacle between me and the game. Turbo's interface is smooth and polished, and I find myself drawn into the game and track editor far more than in the past.\n\nTurbo is also wrapped up in VERY stylish art. The "Japanese poster art meets retro arcade" style is awesome, and the game seems to radiate excitement all the time.

The editor is impossible to use, and the gameplay is just too hard. The game has changed to an average 20 years old to a baby game. I've had all Trackmania Original, Sunrise, United, United Forever, Nation, Nation Forever, 2 Stadium, 2 Canyon, Shootmania 2 Valleys and not this. What i've recently noticed is the culture in the cars and map building. Now, It's a whole lot different.\n\nIt still got some few bugs in itself but that's explainable (Ubisoft) and singleplayer is way to easy. There is so much colors that it is impossible to navigate. I haven't tested all the cars yet, but I can tell that this needs some update (PC Fix and more compatible to PC).\n\nI can understand the bugs because of the transfer from Xbox to PC. Compared to all the other games, I'll say this is too colorful, too destracting, bad stearing, a few bugs and has become a babygame.\n\nI like the new Lagoon, the music and the counter at the beginning: "drei, zwei, eins, GO!" haha","March 24","false","5.3"," 16 of 33 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","16","33","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Juvo/recommended/375900/","Juvo","Juvo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Juvo/","250 products in account","Trackmania Turbo is fun, I'll keep it that simple. But there's something that needs to be made clear:\n\nThis game is not made for creative players who enjoy getting the best out of trackmania. This game is made for the more casual side of players who want nothing more than pure gameplay. If you want a larger range of customization (car, map and replay-wise), more community focused events on anything Trackmania, you should get (one of) the individual trackmania² environments, or Trackmania Nations/United. If you're here for racing on all environments into one, simply beating times and having a mere joy on several maps. This game might be the one for you.\n\nTrackmania's latest installment has a change of focus when it comes to customization. Instead of giving the player the full capability of being creative with their car, the player has a limited customization range which he or she has to unlock through playing the campaign. This is rather disappointing to the people who enjoy the change of car models, skins and horns (not in this game) at an instant. On the bright side however, for players who do not care so much about this: everyone will have their paintwork visible to each other. You won't have to worry about witnessing a grey skin of someone's car, because there is no issue with temporarily downloading the skin from every player on a server. This new feature of unlocking customization items also heavily improves the joy of the campaign map. There's actually something to achieve now, rather than just a good time.\n\nTrackmania Turbo's offers what they call "semi-dedicated servers": players host their own lobby, but the lobby is hosted through the servers of Ubisoft. This is bad, but not too bad. On launch day I noticed quite a painful delay in button pressing. I've tried to reset my car on some online servers, to have nothing happen. Then after pressing 5 times in a row, I was launched back to the start, to notice the countdown stuck on 2 for a short while. This would probably not have happened if the servers were all purely dedicated, or I shouldn't have played on launch, but the fact that people can still launch a lobby from a list of games where a hundred people can join at once is still pretty okay in my book.\n\nThe track editor is focused on making it easy for console, but the legacy editor is still available. Put your mouse on the gear icon and click on the legacy editor option in the dropdown menu.\n\nThe thing I hate most about the game is not having the ability to disable other cars on a map. When you're with a hundred racers, you will not be able to focus on the map when you're racing. All you can do is disable the names, which.. kinda helps? It'd would have been better to keep this ability. Hopefully they will add this in.\n\nThis game may not be worth the full price, but it's definitely a lot of fun if you can get it for 25% off. I heard the devs wanting to give Turbo owners the Lagoon environment for free. So if you want this, but also the lagoon environment. I'd give this game a shot.","March 25","true","63.7"," 11 of 23 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","11","23","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bandi_coot/recommended/375900/","bandi_coot","Bandicoot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bandi_coot/","51 products in account","A good Trackmania experience for consoles, ported back to the PC\nTL;DRI'd not be recommending this at full price. If you're a first timer who wants to try out TM, get the older freewares and try them out to see if TM is your thing. TM Turbo is more of a reboot of the series for the next-gen console age (& PC), and it's a fun and good reboot at that. If you liked the freewares and don't own TM2, this won't disappoint you much.\n\nFull Review:A reasonably priced and equally good addition to the TM franchise. While it still plays like TM (acc,brake,left,right), the PC version isn't without it's issues. This game feels like it was made for consoles and to be fair, that's kind of true. It was a NinDS title years back and even the beta was only available for PS4/XBone. However, since the previous titles were exclusive to PCs, a full PC support is a given considering its history. If you're someone who's looking for that, this isn't that game.\n\nHere are some things that I disliked about this PC version-\nSettings (graphics,input) -> Move cursor up to the top of the screen and click the gear icon in the drop down bar. I'd have preferred them to be somewhere more visible, like in the settings menu.\nGraphics Issues -> If you turn up all water reflection to max possible and look at the water, there's black dots everywhere. Solution? Turn down water reflection to medium.\n(controller) ZeroVery little rumble on my F710 with XInput. Also, I coundn't find any controller layout screen.\n(controller) An issue where if want to drift with LT(brake)+Stick, it won't register the LT as brake if RT(acc) is also pressed down.\nFeature downgrade -> No private servers. All rooms hosted on dev servers.\nFeature downgrade -> Servers have max 100 players, far fewer than it should've been.\nFeature downgrade -> Customisation is restricted to paint jobs and decals. However, paintjobs/decals arent' car specific and are applied to every single car for all the environments.\nThe playlist is nice but there's only a couple in there and after the first few tracks, it's repetitive. More variety or an in-built custom playlist support would've been nice.\n3 of 4 environments are from the previous game though it looks beautiful here. (Lagoon will be added to TM2 as DLC)\nUPLAY BONUS -> If you're in a region, say, a country which you know is in the continent you've  been given the key for, you won't be able to activate it if Ubisoft thinks you aren't in the region. Tough luck; get a VPN and activate it anyway. I know it's UPlay but I didn't expect this.Nevertheless, the game is fun and a TM game at its core-\nRace tracks are pretty varied, starting with simple turns that get more challenging as you progress. Feels more driftier but I could be wrong.\nThe environment is beautiful for a game where the sole focus is on cutting down every unnecessary millisecond off your lap time. And the map is open-world ish. If your eyes can see it, your drive can drive there.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=652090317\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=652090905\nCarries over the track builder for countless hours of extra gameplay. Would've been nice if there was a Steam Workshop type feature for sharing user created tracks offline but I don't think that'll happen. Because you see, consoles don't do that, so PC can't.\nRuns at a near constant 60fps at 1080p with every setting maxed out on i7-4710HQ + 860M.\nNo DLC or micro-transactions, at least none that I know of.Every positive point here isn't something new to TM and it isn't something that TM Turbo does better than it's predecessors. Yes it has got much better graphics and yes it now has a dynamic soundtrack. The game if anything, has been dumbed down. But I still like to play it and I have fun playing it. It's a good reboot, just not a good enough TM sequel.","March 24","false","17.9"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","9","19","0","0"

If you enjoyed TM1 and 2 then stay away because they have made the cars all but undrivable in 2 of the 4 biomes.  Real shame because graphically it's better than both earlier TM's but the "driveability" just isn't there.  Stadium is pretty good, but you need to fight through the other three areas to get there and the car steering is just hopeless in 2 of them.  In TMU the car physics were quite different in each of the 7 biomes but they were all fun and the learning curve was quick and steady and you eventually master it.  In TM Turbo it's almost like the more you get the hang of it the harder it gets - to the point where a small tap on the steering button is enough to send the car careering into the wall or a cascade of over-compensation resulting in you coming to a halt facing the wrong direction when all you ever wanted to do was turn a little to the left.  How could they let such a fault through testing?  Not recommended, don't buy because you will regret.","April 14","false","5.2"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","8","17","0","0"

It has a nice coat of paint on it and is quite cohesive (mostly).\n\nThey revamped the cars to make them more hotrod like, there's an announcer dude reacting to whatever you do on the track, the existing environments have been spiced up with these weird neon signs, there's turbo flames coming out of your car when getting onto a boost. Everytime there's the 3 2 1 countdown before a race starts, it happens in a different language. The game has a killer intro movie. There's these weird cool quotes on the loading screens.\n\nThe online custom track sharing is very bad. No straightforward way to find, download and play custom tracks in a game where the Trackbuilder is featured so prominently that it's on the very first line in the main menu. It isn't helped by the fact that you can't name any of your tracks. All the tracks you make follow the naming structure of "Username [Tracknumber] [Tracklength] [Trackstyle]", e.g. "Kewlsnake 17 Short Tech" would be a track I made. Oh and you can't delete any of the tracks that you upload online!\n\nThe server names follow a similar naming structure as the tracknames and I think this combined with the very rudimentary custom track sharing will severely hamper the online community component in the long run.\n\nI think the singleplayer campaign is pretty great, it features 200 tracks from the 4 different environments (one new for this game, the others have been featured in other games). I think the unlocking of tracks could've been handled better. You need to get either bronze/silver or gold medals in 100% of the previous maps to unlock the next set of maps which is always a different environment. I would've liked to see that doing well in Stadium maps would unlock more Stadium maps for me or that if I did very well in previous maps and got either silver or gold medals instead of the required bronze, I would unlock certain sets of maps earlier. Now I'm forced to get medal X in 100% of previous maps to unlock the next set. I would've liked that getting medal X in most of the maps would've been enough to unlock the next map.\n\nThe local coop component seems to be pretty fleshed out. You have Hotseat, Arcade, Split Screen, Mono Screen and a Double Driver campaign all for coop fun. There is also a "secret" mode where you can enter cheat codes which consists out of punching in 3 of the face buttons to get one of the local coop modes + a twist. Very cool in concept, in practice quite ♥♥♥♥♥♥ because the 64 possible different combinations only end up in the 4 local coop modes + a couple of very minor changes, giving out 9 different "modes" in total.\n\nThere's a Stunts mode in the game that the game barely acknowledges. You can enable it on the online servers but zero explanation about it.\n\nYou can save replays, the game never acknowledges how you can do this (you press R).\n\nThere's this random track generator in the game which is cool. I don't think the tracks it makes are particularly great. I feel like you need to slowdown a lot or you'll crash into something in the air or the turns aren't properly signaled or there's a turbo just before this very tight turn. Stuff like that. Maybe good for tech tracks?\n\nI think the car customization stuff is ok. Not elaborate but you can unlock more stuff by getting more gold medals and it has a nice progression. You can also get upto 6 "Legendary Paintworks" by spending uplay points which is a total makeover for your car. I personally like the Double Driver one a lot.\n\nIn general, I don't think I would recommend a purchase unless you're interested in the singleplayer campaign / local coop part. If you're interested in a vibrant online community, go buy Trackmania 2: Stadium for 5 bucks on Steam now or try out the demo or try out Trackmania Nations Forever which is free.\n\nThe release of Turbo has revitalised TM2: Stadium again which is cool.\n\nI think it's pretty sad/funny that even in the new Turbo game, people keep playing Stadium, even in favor of the new environment (Rollercoaster Lagoon).\n\nEDIT: Some things that are cool about Turbo that aren't immediately noticeable.\n\nThere is an "Use Joker" option after finishing a track that's greyed out initially. Say that you need to get a Silver Medal for a track to proceed but can't quite manage to hit that time. After you hit the bronze medal 3 times, you will get a "Silver Joker" which allows you to proceed to the next track.\n\nOn top of that, there's some cool visual language going on in the campaign track selection screen.\n\nIn the start, if you get the required bronze medals for the next tracks to unlock, they squares will get filled up. From the moment you need to score silver medals to unlock more tracks, only the squares where you have gotten silver medals are filled. So the game adjusts to what you're needing at that moment which is cool.\n\nAlso, see the 23 that's coloured in green? That's a track where I've gotten the Trackmaster medal (Which is where I've beaten the time of the track author).\n\nSee how the 55 track is half filled? That's because it's a track where I've obtained the Silver Joker that I talked about earlier. It counts as a Silver medal for all accounts and purposes but if I want to get a "legit" silver medal, I can always go back to that track and get it.\n\nPretty cool!","March 26","false","14.5"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Flutters/recommended/375900/","Flutters","Flutters","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Flutters/","80 products in account","A worthy follow-up of a great franchise!\n\nI love the colors, love the arcade-style, love the local multiplayer, hell, I love just about everything that there is to love about Trackmania Turbo! I have been a fan since the first game, and while the second was lacking a lot in my opinion, Turbo sets it straight by listening to the complaints and giving the people what they wanted: various environments, new mechanics, smooth gameplay, four distinct styles of play, but also has added some pretty nifty new features. Many of them involving local multiplayer, splitscreen, coop and more!\n\nI also love how the shift went from the competitive players to the more casual players, and I may be alone in this, but it's my opinion. The HUD looks clean, straightforward compared to previous TM games, and I love the pinging option! I am a social player myself, so being able to welcome a new player without needing to stop or restart my race is pretty fun. Just one hit of a button, and I have sent a simple "Hi!" to the newcomer.\n\nNow, there are some downsides.\n\nThe first and most noticable being the trackbuilder on PC. For consoles, it looks pretty neat, but also something to get used to. Luckily, there's an option to revert to the old editor for PC. Sadly enough, it's hidden in the top bar, and only when you're editing, so many players will simply not even see it.\n\nThen there's the lack of customization. Now, I do agree that custom models aren't necessary, but the only customization that we have right now are unlockable skins, decals and more. I'd love to have the ability to paint your car the way you like it. With brushes, stickers and whatnot.\n\nThe final bit, which is only a minor annoyance, is that when water reflections are on high, the water shows black squares when viewed from afar. But since it doesn't really affect anything else than graphics, I can let it slip.\n\nOverall, a great game. Nothing more to say about it!","March 26","true","15.5"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/meganag/recommended/375900/","meganag","Nag","http://steamcommunity.com/id/meganag/","179 products in account","Visuals: this game is art. Everything flashes and has this colorful arcade feel that fits the game's style perfectly. Technically, graphics quality is the same from Trackmania 2. But visuals are better because of a nicer artistic direction.\n\nAudio: There's more than 40 tracks by EDM producers in the game. If you like house you're gonna love this. During races, the music is dynamically mixed according to your speed. This makes you get pumped in high speed tracks, but isn't perfect, especially in tracks where you speed up and down constantly. Sound FX are vastly improved from the previous games, including turbo sounds, engine sounds, ambient and crashing sounds. There's also an announcer, which you may like or not, but you can turn off anyway.\n\nGameplay: In comparison to previous Trackmania - The multiplayer game is no longer a spreadsheet simulator. "Hardcore fans" dislike it. I like it. Some unimportant customization is gone. The important, like replay editing, track building and custom games, are still here. Completely custom servers are going to be added in the next patch. But the racing, which is what actually is the core of Trackmania, remains the same from previous games. Amazing sense of speed, completely crazy tracks and great controls. Gameplay is based on time trials and shaving off precious centiseconds to get the best time. However, Trackmania isn't for you if you want a game with car-to-car collisions or simulation.\n\nInterface/Customization: Menus are stylish, but some settings are hidden in a bar that appears only when you hover your mouse on the top of the screen. And these settings are important. There's sliders for music/sound FX volume, graphics settings, a replay editor, the classic track editor and control configuration hidden there. A lot of people are missing this and giving the game bad ratings.\n\nCar painting has been simplified from the previous games. Instead of painting your own car, you unlock skins and pre-placed stickers for cars. It adds a sense of progression, but it would be nice if you could paint manually too. Maybe in an update?\n\nHUD could be better. Since it was made with consoles in mind the elements are bigger than they need to be and end up being distracting (especially in multiplayer). However, this should be the easiest thing to fix with a patch.\n\nI have been playing Trackmania since United. For me, this one is great, maybe even the best.","March 26","true","72.0"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Luckily you can turn off that babbling.\nThe music mix thing is also just unnecessary fanciness. It does not improve flow like the devs think. The few repetitive tracks that play might only make you want to throw your PC out the window even more.\nThe random track generator was probably one of the main reasons why I got interested in buying this game, but it wasn't so great after all. The generator occasionally doesn't even make drivable tracks. Sometimes it places only sharp turns after another with a booster right before so you'll only crash. Sometimes it places checkpoint after checkpoint. No logic.\nUplay integration is unnecessary and the lack of custom content is quite a shame. I would've wanted to drive my Lada...\nNevertheless, I enjoy this game and I recommend you to pick it up when it's on sale for half the price.","March 27","true","4.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you care about nothing as much as Trackmania, stick with Trackmania 2.\n\nI'm gonna take a stand for Trackmania Turbo, Nadeo and Ubisoft, even if that's a very unpopular thing to do.\nTrackmania Turbo is a beautiful, very polished game with 4 environments and a very capable multiplayer. It's a game that most certainly would not have been made - at least in this fidelity - if it wouldnt cater to a wider audience (I'm speaking of consoles). Previously, you paid 50€ for 3 environments, now you pay 40€ for 4. Good deal right there.\nThis issue many people seem to have is that you cant mod this game to your hearts content, whereas this was possible in all previous iterations. To want to mod all this stuff - cars, server, music etc - is of course a valid point. For some. Because i dont. I dont care about what my care looks like, they all drive the same anyway. I dont want my UI cluttered with some BS plugin someone thinks is funny or handy or whatever. The game's UI tells me everything I need to know. And for gods sake, I dont want some 14 year olds who spend their allowance on server hosting to dictate what music I listen to while playing. Because I've yet to listen to a decent song being played on any server in Trackmania 2.\n\nSo if you're not completely crazy about Trackmania, you just like playing it, this is the best Trackmania yet. If you are, you better stick to Trackmania 2.","March 25","true","6.2"," 10 of 22 people (45%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","45","10","22","2","1"

Stripped down from the too many customization options that were mostly in my way, this one focuses on making racing perfect.\nStadium is still good old Stadium.\nCanyon feels and looks a little bit better.\nValley has been drastically improved with wider blocks which make smoother tracks.\nLagoon is a bit of a mix of Island and Bay, with a hint of F-Zero high speed sharp reflexes at times. It is amazingly fun.\nAnd Trackmania is finally properly enjoyable with real friends with loads of local multiplayer modes. Monoscreen is hilarious, and it has collisions between cars!\nThey also did a lot of effort on the soundtrack and visual effects to improve the game feel drastically, drifting, turbo's, jump are all felt with much more strength.\nThe most pleasant, smoothest, best looking, best feeling Trackmania experience for me.","March 25","true","80.0"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","2","6","0","0"

While my performance is higher than average, I consider myself the casual trackmania player and fan. I get on the game, play a bunch of races, and depnding on my mood or if some ♥♥♥♥♥ nab my third place spot with 10 seconds left, I'll be done for the day. Rinse and repeat for a few years.\n\nTrackmania Turbo doesn't really deviate from things. 4 different environments with 4 very different cars and feels of gameplay. Desert and Stadium don't really have any new sort of trackpieces, and that's fine by me (considering we've been playing the same Stadium since Nations/United). Rollercoaster Lagoon brings a whole new feel to the series, and I will admit that the rollercoaster style, fast-paced driving upside-down is FUN. I will play this game as I have the pervious games the same way, and I will enjoy every session.\n\nSo what if it has no replays (yet), so what if it has no custom servers (yet), and who cares about the Uplay thing (seriously, stop whining such little children every time Uplay is involved). If you are a casual, or a little more than casual Trackmania player like myself, YOU WILL HAVE FUN. The game JUST came out, and so many "devoted fans" are down this game's throat already.\n\nIt helps to provide constructive feedback to improve a game, and not just repeat what the last guy is saying and follow a useless bandwagon. Sure, adding the desired features would be nice, but for now: Enjoy racing, enjoy the loops and bounds, and enjoy getting your first place spot taken with 10 seconds left.","March 25","true","5.7"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","2","6","0","0"

It's all the environments in one package from TM2, plus lagoon. If you're a newer player interested in TM, this is probably a good buy. I don't have any gripes with the pure gameplay aspects.\n\nThere's some things missing that TM2 titles had, you can see lists in other reviews. So reluctance to switch over is pretty justified if you already own TM2 titles. And they did alter the handling of the cars a little, but as a canyon veteran, I can only really notice it there. And the lack of global track leaderboards (dedis, or even local server rankings) is a big thing too. I'm under the impression that TM2 Lagoon will still come out at some point in the future. And I hope Nadeo gives maniaplanet more love.\n\nIt's a fun game for what it is, a console trackmania game that was released on PC too. But it's not the sequel to TM2. So it's hard to recommend this game to a lot of the more hardcore fans of Trackmania 2, unless you want an early peek at Lagoon.","March 25","true","20.9"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","2","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jflameriderholman/recommended/375900/","jflameriderholman","Flamerider","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jflameriderholman/","82 products in account","The brief scope of TM Turbo is that it's a really fun, pretty version of the Trackmania games with a lot of aesthetic UI thematic upgrades that give the game a whole lot of style, make the gameplay more visually responsive, and the campaign has some fun levels. So it's a really good Trackmania game to play. For everything else it's a really, really wobbly step back and could be the breaking point between buying this and any older Trackmania game, and it remains a niche game that while it takes some strides to appeal to more people can't drop its often seen as dull core gameplay.\n\nI rate this in terms of "Trackmania games" and not "Games" because the series is pretty niche and not a lot about it keeps it up in its own right. You'll see a lot of complaints about how people think it should just be a Racing Game instead of a game about competitive time trials; like, really angry ones; so it's clear it's very much not for everyone and you have to be sure that you like Driving sims that aren't actually driving sims but don't have the usual fun part of a racing game that's not a sim and just really like improving on time records. People out there exist, this game wouldn't have as many iterations without it, and Trials (as in the motorbike game) is all about that, it's just those games are more about Platforming Challenges with motorbikes and a lot of people can see that. These games do a lot of pretending they're proper racing games, often accidentally. Those trailer shots with all the ghosts driving simultaneously are supposed to be impressive stress tests but confuse people. Maybe? I can't tell.\n\nNadeo are acquired by Ubisoft, which due to their recent strides and current reputation have a bit of a tough stigma attached to them but it's a benevolent acquisition this time. The two companies have very similar outlooks on multinationalism and I'm pretty sure they get on like a house of fire. Which is why you probably shouldn't get too mad that even though you're buying the game on Steam, you will have to open the game in uPlay. You will also have to input a code in uPlay to give you the game proper, you get the trial version otherwise. Boy that is a deep notch in the pole. It's at least a little better than the Nadeo-brand platform they were trying to push, but if you were going by Steam versions that particular venture had no presence aside from an extra click that they have even now removed.\n\nAfter that though you can see where my "improved aesthetic" comment comes in. Where all TM games previously had either minimalist or utilitarian UI with no particular theme going on, this one's got a nice arcadey feel with colours and flashing lights. Stuff appears on the screen in pretty fonts and there's a good deal of feedback of UI and sound from hitting an 'Engine Stall' pad so you can actually tell what's happening right away. They even use it in way more levels as a result, giving it more interesting uses than it ever had. So that's one good thing.\n\nAnother is that it's a readjustment and a complete package of the Trackmania 2 environments so far, plus one really good one. Stadium is still... stadium, but the Valley has a completely different vehicle handling model (bouncy, like the Bay SUVs with huge wheels instead of really springy suspension), and the new one lets you play with magnetized rollercoaster roads, allowing F-Zero level twists and bends. Really fun stuff. It's not as value for money as, say, United, but there's real labour that's not obvious because it's the same environments, plus one.\n\nThey added more stuff for the layman that likes playing stuff with their friends. There's a co-op version of the campaign where you race the tracks as a duo controlling the same car, each with about 50% of the power and control of the whole thing, and the two need to work together in sync for the best performance. It's super a gimmick but it's a fun thing that's there, and they added this Micro-Machines race-ahead-until-your-opponents-are-out-of-the-camera mode. This, as an absolute first for the series, includes actual player-on-player collision. Now there's something there for you people. That style means you miss out on the fast pace of the game and so isn't as fun as it 'could' be but at this point I'll take baby steps.\n\nAlright, now the real problems. The previous ones were merely mild beefs. These are the ones that will hurt this game.\n\nThis game is not as supportive of mods and manual track sharing, if at all. The vehicle selector, rather than letting you draw out your own texture for the card, and straight up import a new one complete with an entirely different mesh if you went to a TM modding site, throws that stuff away. You pick from unlockable skins which apply to all the cars you use. You cannot mix and match, and unless there's a work around I don't know about, there are zero signs of mod support.\n\nThe Track creation is also a step down. You are still fully capable as far as putting track, terrain, and decorations goes, but they created this console friendly interface for selecting and placing stuff. Alright, fair enough, a good bit of thinking there even though the result is not perfect and I'm not at all elegant with it. They have, however, removed any way of creating a track otherwise. Even with mouse and keyboard, you have to use the same interface; the much faster way of the older games does not come back in this one. You can still put the track you want together in the end though, but that's enough as it is without seeming like there's no custom camera or UI control. The older games allowed you to put trigger blocks down for camera changes and even animate movie sequences at the beginning and end with text, images, and camera panning. Really put a personal touch on a track you created that would help it stand out. Unless I'm missing a trick or a button (and I will go back and write this off if I'm wrong), that's gone too. It's a bit cheating too, the solo campaign really likes putting your camera in first person for the rollercoaster segments and you can't do that yourself. You can't seem to name the tracks either, that's the bigger crime for sure. That's just basic fundemental "I want to make my own stuff" mechanics and they didn't add it.\n\nThey also made an in-game thing for Tracksharing. What they had before was you either, in the old days, shared the file on a site like tm-exchange where all the tracks were hosted and you downloaded the ones you wanted, and then more recently in United people could have their own sites that you could browse through an in-game web browser and hosted their tracks on those, but the sites were there for someone that didn't know the arcane workings of whatever this French developer decided they were doing with that. It's a mystery to me what that even fully was. And while it's more substantial than the latter, it's no substitute for the former. You can search for criteria and everyone can put their own thing on it, but there's no names, only the users that uploaded them, and if you want to play for their medals you can't do it with the take-as-many-tries-as-you-need system. You have to play by a three lives system that is only active for that mode and when expired just boots you back to the previous menu, which is usually only a bother by way of the loading screen unless it was a more than one track challenge. It's extremely counter-intuitive and you can't change any of it. It's not fixed any problems so far and perhaps provided many more. There probably won't be a Turbo section on tm-exchange if I come back to check in a month.","March 27","true","11.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Also, some people have been complaining about the pc controls being too sensitive. I onlg had problems with the Valley setting, but thats because I personally suck at it. (bloody trees), not because "simply touching the direction keys make your car spin uncontrollably". Yeah, it'd be great if UPlay was optional, seeing as I bought the game on Steam, and yeah, some freedom with customisation would be nice, especially changing colours so your car stands out a bit more.

You need to make an account for this and it will start every time before you run Trackmania. It has to synchronize save games every time you start the game, so it's kinda annoying. You can link it to your steam account so you don't have to worry about remembering your account & password.\n\nThe game itself is the same good stuff as the previous Trackmania games.

A review needs more time!\nI have a about 400 to 500 hours in all trackmania titles I own, so I spent a little time on the tracks.\n\nThe Solo campaign is awesome. 200 Tracks with 4 different cars is enought in my opinion, but I saw some tracks rebuilded from the previous releases (Tm2/Tmnf), but seriously I don't mind. And now i need to rage a bit...\n->Where is the profile editor? It will use the name you currently have in Uplay! Bye bye fancy colored names. Bye bye horn uploader. Bye bye Clan tag.\n->Everytime someone joins the multiplayer room a message on the left side of the screen pops up that forces you to press a button to say hello... While you are driving...\n->I couldn't find a button to turn off enemy cars. Ye it's awesome to start with 100 people from one single spot. Btw everyone has their names over the cars. Can't turn that off either.\n->You might noticed by now the game lacks on settings... Well guess what happens when we take a look into the graphics settings. More than half the settings are missing. Is this game a console port?\n-> If you played the previous TM's you will know Maniaplanet. You could switch between games, visit internet sites etc. Poof gone.\n->The game is completely optimized for Controllers. You won't need a mouse. But wait... Car customization? Track building? Is it now easier witht he same amount of customization? I don't know yet, time will show!\n\nOkay enough of the rage. This games doesn't feel unfinished... I just ask myself who decided to rip out so much important stuff (I want my own profile /nickname/horn/club etc. :( ) Anyhow I will give it a thumbs up, because I know they will patch many stuff. As i said this isn't a review, just a first impression!\n\nI know that the Trackmania devs are always listening to their fanbase. Please guys hear at us!

The track building is very well done as the grid based track placements seems non-existant while driving. It may seemed dumb down right when you start, but you need to show the upper bar, click the gear, and switch to classic track builder to get the editor designed for m/kb. Career mode offers a large amount of tracks with a hard challange ahead to get every gold metal. It is a nice break from the norm of racing as this game focuses on hotlaps and track mastery then position based races. All the tracks have intense stunts and high speed which is brought together with a great sence of speed, awesome optimization (100 fps average on max settings multi and singleplayer with a Radeon R9 270X) and great physics. Costumization is great even though I see negative comments complaining about no horn (If you play any source game and you hear a person using Source DJ you see how custom sounds gets very annoying quick so you'll be glad) and no custom skins (if they had this I bet 40% of all skins will be anime porn).\n\nOverall, this is a good buy for anyone who likes racing games and it is worth full price so no sale needed to pick this one up.","April 10","true","103.0"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

To start with I really liked it, and then as the differences between this and other TMs became apparent I felt increasingly less pleased with it.\n\nThose points have been discussed elsewhere by others, so I'll not add to that. Except to say that I did start to make a list of 'pros' and 'cons' comparing this with TM2, and quickly found 8 plus points and 21 negatives. (Although quite a few of the latter turn out to be things which have been community-provided for TM2; not in the original implementation. Although the points still stand, as I can't see the community getting behind Turbo in the same way.)\n\nBut in the end I've decided it's a caveated 'Yes' for me.\n\nThe thing is; I think it's actually a pretty good game in its own right. And if you completely ignore the orignal TMs for whatever reason, there really isn't anything else quite like it out there afaik. It certainly has that 'just one more go; I've almost got it now. And that last bad time was all entirely my own fault' feel to it.\n\nIf you are new to TM, and/or want an accessible twitch-racer that's fresher and more 'this gen' than the (now a bit tired-looking) other TM games, then this may well be for you. It really is TM meets the console generation.

The graphics are a godsend, and it's certainly a nice upgrade from TMU which I play(ed) quite a lot.\n\nThere is a nice long single-player campaign that should be fun to grind through, however I dislike how you have to play through every single environment so you can start on the next set of maps. For instance, Canyon is my favourite environment, and I really don't like any of the other maps, but I have to play through all of them so I can move onto the next set of Canyon maps.\n\nThere isn't a lot happening in the way of multiplayer too...the servers are now hosted my Nadeo, so there's less customisability to them. I doubt the multiplayer/eSports scene will ever get as big as it did for TMU or TM2 because of the difficulty in setting the matches up, and we probably won't see larger scale servers like 'The Loveshack' run by FAB team any time soon.\n\nControls are easy enough to pick up, but I'd definitely recommend using a controller as it makes everything 10x easier in my opinion.\n\nI haven't tried the local multiplayer yet, but the Double Driver mode sounds fun, and having some mates over to try out the 4-player splitscreen would be awesome. I'll probably try and find some friends first and then update this review with my thoughts.\n\nTo be honest, I'd recommend buying this game in a sale, as it's definitely got replayability and an enjoyment factor. I don't think it's worth £30 though, as the lack of severs and apparently small user-base let it down a bit. Anything under £20 and I'd say 'get it now'.\n\nBut yeah, let's go with a solid 7/10.","May 20","true","6.4"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/eeveeteamspirit/recommended/375900/","eeveeteamspirit","Raja","http://steamcommunity.com/id/eeveeteamspirit/","90 products in account","I have played every Trackmania game to date. This is primarily going to compare them, but also think of Turbo as a standalone game, over a series of topics;\n\n1) Customization - Since the original Trackmania, players have always been able to customly paint cars without any set grids and whatnot. However, in Turbo, this isn't the case, as players customize their cars through set options that are gained by earning Gold Medals in the campaign. As much as this is a downgrade from previous installments, it finally gives a reason for those who just want to play the game to actually try the campaign. Would I call this a perk? That depends- for people such as myself, who have never been good at designing a car to begin with, yes. However, for those who can actually take the time to make a good-looking skin, no, this is a drastic loss.\n\n2) Local Multiplayer - Hotseat has been around since the original trackmania, and split-screen since Trackmania 2. However, also in every previous installment was Profiles- a big loss specifically to me. Profiles used to be kept with the game and were for all those who played the game to enter their profile, change their car, make maps, and etc. However, Trackmania Turbo gets rid of Profiles, but still has Hotseat, in a more of an arcade fashion, where each player, when it is there turn, has the option to change their name using 4 letters. A massive loss, in my mind, however, the gameplay of the new hotseat is nice. Split Screen hasn't changed much, so not much to say on that.\n\n3) Map Editor - A huge step up from the previous games. The Beginner mode, introduced in Nations & United Forever, helped people completely new to the game make maps with reasonably good detail in the background. Now, the difference between Normal mode and Advanced mode is one that I find perfectly fitting. For those who want to make perfect, amazing maps- Advanced mode is great, as it's completely barren from the start, and you can edit every little thing. For others who simply want a track to play on, Normal mode is very helpful, as you can build the map very quickly with various presets, and also have decoration filled in for you. Not to mention the landscapes are all as set templates. And the final amazing improvement to the Map Editor is the Random Track Generator- which I'm in love with. The Random Track Generator is literally an AI that pieces together the various presets from Normal Mode in a varying fashion each time. I'm still unsure as to what it prioritizes, but that makes the tracks even more fun.\n\n4) Campaign & Singleplayer - Realistically, the only difference between this and the previous games is that the campaign actually has a reason to be played now- for unlockables. However, on the downside, it forces you to play all 10 tracks of the previous difficulty & environment before moving to the next, unlike previous Trackmania games. Not much else to say here.\n\n5) Online Multiplayer - Being a part of the Nations/United Forever Dirty Deeds clan, I was playing multiplayer quite frequently on Forever. From what I can say, there's only a time attack mode for online so far, as compared to previous; Time Attack, Rounds, Team, Cup, etc. It's a bit of a let-down, but at the same time, most multiplayer servers from Forever were Time Attack anyways. Past this is also the stats for tracks, which people seemed to have valued. As much as I do miss seeing the world-wide fastest time on a track, it was a mod for Trackmania, never actually part of the game, so we can't really include it here. There's no more dedicated servers, which is a but upsetting, as it means everything is now hosted by people, BUT, it makes it much easier to set up a quick server for yourself and a few friends.\n\nThere's a bit more to the game that I'm not putting here, but that's mainly because it's not really comparable with other installments, or I've yet to experience it myself. From how I've enjoyed the game so far, I do recommend Trackmania veterans, and newcomers, to play the game, as it certainly, at least for me, lives up to the hype I've had since July.","March 25","true","59.9"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","20","1","5","0","0"

It has a nice and fresh feeling to it, mainly caused by the new blocks and car models. Yes, there are some problems that have been mentioned in other reviews and I don't want to go through them in detail.\nBut the main point why I like it is simply that it has this great arcade-touch to it that was missing in the ManiaPlanet games a bit. In ManiaPlanet you had to read a lot of tutorials, guides and other information to get to know how things work exactly. Turbo is a bit different in this point. You start it and you see what you need and what you will get, simple as that. There is simply no need to learn things that don't belong to playing the game actually.\n\nDon't get me wrong. I still think that, when Lagoon is released for MP, there is no need for anyone to buy Turbo. But if you have some money to spare and want to support Nadeo (who actually did a good job on this one IMO) AND if you don't want to wait until Lagoon is released for MP: BUY THIS GAME!\n\nBut before you buy it you should be clear about what you get. This game is actually Maniaplanet with a few tweaks here and there and with less complexity. I think it is good that the game isn't as complex as MP because it's much more beginner friendly. There is no blockmixing, no custom objects and no custom ingame skinning like in MP.\n\nIf you can renounce those features you will probably like this game. If you can't live without these features better wait for Lagoon for MP.","March 31","true","70.9"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

I can very well understand the frustration of players who are used to those features and I don't mean to belittle their complaints, perhaps this isn't the sequel for them. However some perspective should be given because if you're thinking about buying the game, honestly, reading that list how many of those complaints are that important to you. As a newcomer to the series they're not stopping me from enjoying the game in any way.\n\nPerhaps the game would be better with those features added and maybe I'll get hooked and start playing the other TM's looking for a more hardcore experience but right now Trackmania Turbo is a great entry point for people like me into the series, it's extremely fun in its own right. I recommend it.\n","March 31","true","18.4"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

After a few tracks we started to get really good and we enjoyed the game even more than just play with splitscreen.\nThe feel of driving is still as good as in previous TM editions and the four different car types just feel a bit different to each other.\nThe graphics are beautiful and very fast and should run with lower settings on older machines without any issues.\n\nThe game is awesome and I just can recommend it.\n\nNotes about the complains in other reviews:\n- People complain about UPlay, but I didn't had any issues with it during my first session. Don't judge a game by it's container. Without Ubisoft we wouldn't be able to play the game.\n- People complain about that the customization has gone - and yes, it feels a bit wired to show the winner of an internet match and all look the same. I guess this will change once the people start changing the color and stickers on their cars.\n- Trackmania has evolved. Evolving means to change things to something different. Good or bad is a subjective feeling so please don't tell people to stop buying the game just because you don't like it.\n- You want to play a game that's just like the old TM Stadium or TM Canyon?

Just going to start by getting that out of the way.  I've been playing Trackmania for over a decade, and I feel like I'm the only diehard Trackmania fan that isn't being blinded by nostalgic fluff.\n\nIt's fast, it runs well, it looks nice, and the cars handle very well.  The physics for each pre-existing environment have been tweaked to varying degrees, most noticeable being Valley (I.E. Down and Dirty), where it doesn't feel practically impossible to turn on dirt without losing speed because you didn't have millimeter precision.  It feels much more fluid now than it did in TM2.\n\nNew blocks have been added for each environment, which helps keep it from feeling too samey to TM2, and adds some new surprises to each environment.\n\nIf there were one complaint I do overall agree with, it is the lack of leaderboards per track (I.E. Dedi's).  Although to a casual player, this would largely be a useless feature anyways, as Dedi boards only really tended to matter for high skill players, as they are the only ones that ever make it onto them.\n\nThat aside, the game plays great, and in the end, that is really what matters.  This is a time trials game with ridiculous over the top car physics, and it excels at being just that.  Although I haven't had the chance to try them, the new local multiplayer modes all look like they'd be a blast to play with friends, although it'd be nice if a few of them were available for online play (Though I understand why they aren't, as the majority of them would be complete garbage with latency between players).\n\nOverall, this is a great spinoff of the Trackmania series (Yes, this is a spin off, targetted to console players, not a sequel for PC players, get over it).  It may be lacking some fluff that the PC crowd is used to, but that's all it's really lacking... fluff.  The game itself is fantastic and I'd recommend it to anyone who loves arcade racers.","March 25","true","17.8"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","2","8","0","0"

Super recommended!\n\n(Since F-Zero X and R4: Ridge Racer Type 4)\n\nMy initial review had ended there already, but since I'm a little shocked about all the negative reviews and comments about this game, I decided to write some more...\n\nTMT is time trial based racing at its very best. The controls are responsive and nuanced, the track designs are outstanding, and there is a lot of content and variety, both online and offline. The fine developers at Nadeo have crafted a unique game with an abundance of imaginative features and ideas. It really succeeds to fill a void, that so many rather standardized modern racing games have left behind.\n\nThe game can be quite hard, especially the Rollercoatser Lagoon setting, and to feel some frustration is part of what Trackmania is about. Still, Nadeo has achieved a balanced progression in the campaign mode, which always gives you enough rewards and incentives to continue. I'm usually not too much into super challenging games, but TMT is absolutely addicting.\n\nAnd the presentation of TMT is fantastic. A great color scheme evoking memories of 90's arcade racing, some of the coolest original cars and environments in a long time, and very nice signage and typography. While the later is not quite on the level of what Designers Republic did for the WipEout series, it does come pretty close sometimes. Many complaints here on Steam are targeted at the limited customization options compared to previous Trackmania games, but I find it hard to understand, why anyone would want to change any of those assets. The game achieves an amazing coherent art style, which is just a pure joy to experience.\n\nTMT is more focused and polished than any Trackmania game before, making it my favorite Trackmania experience by far. I'm very inclined to say that this is one of the best arcade racers of all time!","March 31","true","27.6"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/darktimcampy/recommended/375900/","darktimcampy","PhysX#Timcampy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/darktimcampy/","137 products in account","First I’ll start with a quote. Let's be professional here.\n"You're complaining about car customization in Trackmania? #Salt"\n\n2nd thing: if you’ve troubles with the new car editor, here’s how to get back to the old one =>\nhttp://s20.postimg.org/4vvkv5k4t/Classic.jpg (thanks kciuk)\n\nAlright, Tm Turbo is just released that you see a lot of bad critics. Please people try to be objective when you’re criticizing a game that just got released… You have an impact you know?\n\nAnyway, the game is dividing people, even myself I started to argue with a friend about that. My point? It’s a waste of time. There is obviously 2 sides, the “NO MORE CUSTOM? *cry* “and the “wow the game’s pretty good”. Personally I’ll push myself out of those two sides and I’ll focus on the stuff that really matters in the gameplay. Though, at the end, I’ll have to actually say something about the “lack of customs whining”.\n\nAnyway, the game’s pretty great, in term of feeling the speed and the basic tracks actually give quite a show off from the game, you’re soon absorbed by the variation of the music from your speed or how much tricks you’ll actually dare to do while doing a track.\n\nAS VETERAN.\n\nThe only thing being aggressive in the gameplay is the steering… Jesus fkin Christ, at first it seemed to be an insult from how hard it was to make the cars turn… But then, I recalled my memories AKA “how to use the brake in trackmania” and a whole new world opened to me. A fluid game with high speed tricks. Since Trackmania Xtrem the cars weren’t that funky, with the stunt mode re-added I’m really looking forward for the maps that the community will create. Seriously, wait a bit before saying that opus is bad.\n\nNOW. To be franc, Trackmania Xtrem is and will be my 1st favorite. But here’s a good opponent, Turbo’s design is really awesome, the music is awesome, the immersion is awesome! When you play it online you can feel what a TrackMania has to give you! Competition. Skill. Fun and Try Hards.\n\nOn a scale from one to 10 I’d give 7.5 to turbo. Due to the steering still a bit tricky at first sight… And also rally environment... Wth is wrong with that environment? It’s like the game programmers put and awful lot of trajectory randomizers… But again… It’s an environment to master (reminding me the snow environment of TM 1).\n\nNow here comes the fun part. You guys knew that was going to be a console porting, don’t be surprised of the look of the UI or the actual server hosting from Nadeo… And yet. Guys. You’re on pc… I’m pretty sure mods will fall in our hands soon. Just wait and see.\n\nAlso there’s saltiness about the lack of customs… Refer yourself to my quote… The cars have a lot of combination paintings… maybe you can’t put “FUKC ♥♥♥♥♥€S GET $$$” on your car’s hood which was a Lamborghini model instead of the basic stadium racing car or put a kiddy pseudo with lots of eye burning colors or have a horn with a music of Justin Bieber…\n\nBut please… If you really were playing Trackmania for those I invite you to buy the Sims.\nIf trackmania got popular it’s because of the driving… Not having the most pimped car/most annoying horn/ most psychedelic pseudo.\n\nI think I made my point there… But here’s a TLDR:\nFrom my POV Turbo is pretty decent besides a slight modification in the driving that you have to get used to, but besides that the universe is really Juicy, giving a good feeling of a retro arcade game with a really bright future that the community has to fill with lots of cool tracks. Now it’s focusing on skill and not custom cars or other things which weren’t needed for the basic gameplay. To me the lack of customs is forgotten for the awesome universe they put TM.\n\nBy the way I heard about a demo… Get it if your opinion is split, make your own experience of Trackmania Turbo.\n\nBesides that… See you online ;)\n\nThanks for reading. :)\n","March 24","true","15.3"," 12 of 29 people (41%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","41","12","29","3","0"

Easy stuff. Graphics looks good and the games runs smoothly. I like how colorful the world is. Feels like trackmania should feel. Awesome and very playable. Although comparing how much the game cost and and how much there is actually the new stuff, this feels little bit too expensive. The only real new what I see is the double driver thing, which I've not tried and not even going to bother. It doesn't even sound something I would like. Going to check the online stuff once I've played the most of the solo/offline tracks. Hope it's worth the money.\n\nEven if this feels kinda expensive I'd still recommend to play this.

They have shown us that with the past few iterations of Trackmania. You see that people are complaining about Uplay, changes in multiplayer, etc. Honestly, Uplay doesn't really bother me. It just opens and sometimes gives you achievements and other than that you don't ever see it. I kinda wanted Steam achievements instead of Uplay achievements though, but it's not a big deal. An achievement is an achievement and it gives a goal to work toward regardless of delivery method. I am actually happy about the 100 person max multiplayer. I feel like it makes it more competetive. The graphics are great. Rollercoaster Lagoon tracks are really fun, great addition to Trackmania. New tracks in other modes are great as well. The only thing I don't like is how the ranking is by track and not overall. I'd like to see my overall place in my state. I blame Ubisoft for everything bad.

I saw it at E3 2015 and thought it looked amazing. I am seeing alot of people say older Trackmania's are better, I cannot comment as I have never played any of the others. However, what I will say is for new people to the series I think it is alot of fun. It feels alot like Trials Fusion but cars instead as on some track restarting happens often haha. The game looks amazing and perfoms at around 120-144fps (V-Sync 144hz Monitor) with a 6GB 980Ti & I7-4790k Quad Core 4.4ghz Turbo. So performance & stability is awesome. I haven't played online much but from what I have played I quite like it. I don't really have anything bad to say about this game at this current point but the game is still young. I will update my review once I play around some more. But for now I will say. If you are new try it out, if you are a TM veteran still try it out as its fun anyway.\n\nEarly review 9/10 (Missing 1 due to some graphics options being unchangeable for some reason)\n\nEDIT (AFTER PLAYING SOME MORE):\nI played quite a bit more since and I do not understand why this game gets some of the hate that it gets. I still have fun playing this game up until this day. It does get a bit rage inducing when trying to perfect some of the later levels but that is where the fun is also ;P.\n\n10/10 I have no problems with this game whatsoever. Haters?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Salyz/recommended/375900/","Salyz","Salyz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Salyz/","58 products in account","EDIT:\nMost of the problems mentioned in my original review still remain, but the more i played of Trackmania Turbo, the more i started to like it for what it is. It's a much different game than the old Trackmania games, but i realized that that was not what they intended. I can now reccomend this game, but i think i would still wait for a discount!\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\nI've played countless hours of Trackmania United Forever, and was very excited for Trackmania Turbo to come out. I started the singleplayer campain and really enjoyed the 4 different environments and the basic racing. Just as i expected from a Trackmania. After around four hours i decided to try out all the other things a Trackmania has to offer, like the Trackbuilder, online multiplayer and the car customization. And i was so dissapointed.\nThis game is lacking so many multiplayer features compared to previous games, it's s quite shocking. There are no dedicated servers, no leaderboards, the UI is a big mess.. And then the Trackbuilder.. It becomes so obvious that this game is a console port. Everything is optimized for a controller, doing basic trackbuilding becomes a pain.\nYou want to name the track you just created? You're out of luck, it just gets a number as the name and you have no way of changing that. Want to share that track? That is also a big mess with some kind of confusing challenges and no way of just realeasing the track on its own.\nYou want to paint your car in some funny or creative way? Nah, they just deleted that feature, but you can now choose between some paintjobs that you can unlock by doing the campaign, yay.\n\nThe basic gameplay is fine, but with all the missing features and this game beeing an obvious console port, i just can't reccommend it in its current state. I regret playing more than 2 hours before realizing the mess that this game is, because i would love to refund it and wait with the purchase until they change the things i mentioned above. And i would advise you to do the same. If you have never played a Trackmania, buy ANY other but this one, they are all fantastic.","March 25","true","41.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The controls are as tight as always, and the 80's arcade styling is a welcome overarching theme that ties the game together well.  The game is as fast-paced as always, and the integral trackbuilder is as good as ever.  Multiplayer has a nice variety of new and returning modes, and the single-player campaign is very nicely expanded.\n\nOn the flip side, the Trackbuilder STILL has parts only Nadeo can use, the Shaders and graphical quality are noticably worse than TrackMania 2 as a result of this being primarily a console game, and there still isn't a local splitscreen multiplayer where it's about getting the best time on a track, within a given time limit.  Seems that's still restricted to LAN party gaming.\n\nThe new Lagoon environment is awesome and the magnetic coaster is a great new element, but the Stadium environment could have used a little more love and the Rally/Desert environments are good but not overly noteworthy.\n\nIn short, if you have Trackmania 2 then only get Turbo if you want the coaster environment, otherwise just get the TM2 environments piecemeal.","May 14","true","21.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
