Avoid.\n\nAt first glance it appears to be a simple poker mmo with micro transaction options.  Everything is going well; you are winning; you're unlocking higher-level tables (which you can't afford yet), until you get to level 13.  At level 13 you are no longer allowed to play at the "low-stakes" table, and instead you are forced to move on to the higher tables, whose buy-ins are 10-13% of your bankroll at this time.  It appears that there are bots floating around these more expensive tables (if you scroll through the screenshots section, you will see a few players that show up everywhere).  The bots yolo their chips every hand, forcing you to potentially lose big and quickly need to pay real money for more fake chips.\n\nAlso:\n-Tables are not consolidated; once people stand up their seats are never filled until the room empties out.  You can switch between tables, and virtually all of them have only one or two people sitting at them; (people = bots in this review).\n-Chat feature is limited to emojis.\n-You cannot play with your steam friends.\n-Betting options are narrow (1/2, 3/4, Pot, All-in).  As I mentioned before with the higher stakes tables, any competitive hand is going to lay waste to your allotment of free chips.","February 21","false","7.1"," 123 of 156 people (79%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","79","123","156","6","16"

I am guessing the line below in their description is so that they can cover their butt in the future if it is proven they have tampered with the card distribution:\n\n" Practice or success at social casino gaming does not imply future success at real money gambling.”\n\nLooking around the reviews and the  forums you will see that there are reports of bot players on the table to leach money off of you once you get to higher levels.\n\nAlso quiet a few trolls and griefers in game spamming chat messages and emotes with no built in mechanism to mute them. In 2016 you would think the devs would implement something like this but it seems they are a few years behind the times.\n\nI tried to suggest a mute button on the forum but got called a bunch of names and attacked by the so called fans of the game with no moderation at all by the dev who seems to be very active on the forum. He is very quick to respond though if someone praises the game.\n\nThere are a few shady people bashing whoever says negative about this poor man's poker. I wouldn't be surprised if there is some serious astroturfing going on behind the scenes. In general the scam vibe is strong with this one!\n\n"Terrible" experience with this game all things considered and I can not recommend at all.\n\nI will not respond to any comments below from fanboys trying to start a flame war. I already wasted over 2 hours of my life on this stinker. Keep it classy!\n\n(Edit: seems like they added the option to disable chat on March 21st. Still my point stands that this game is to be avoided at all costs because of the shady card distribution system and the bots.)","March 10","false","2.9"," 57 of 71 people (80%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","80","57","71","4","2"

The program was calling bets when I wasn't. Know I really think someone cracked this piece of junk! Don't use credit card info, I wouldn't trust it at all.\n\n\nThe game itself is ok, but there are so many donkeys that will call anything that it takes the fun out of the game. It's more like the lottery than it is poker. So many just go all in on anything with just a hope and a prayer.\nEDIT:\nI thought maybe I was being unfair a bit so I've been playing it some more, now I think the game has been hacked. I just watched a player win around 50 or 60 hands, getting insane cards. Either they are the luckiest person I have EVER in 46 years seen play cards or they are cheating.\nEDIT:\nThey added a new game in the program so I thought I would give it a try. Wasn't impressed, it tells you that you have a chance of winning anywhere from 200,000 to 100,000,000 if you are playing the 100,000 a hand table. The issue is I have played about 40 or 50 of these games now and have not seen any but four over 200,000 and those were two 400,000 and two 600,000. Statistically one would assume that you would see at least one over a million in the 100,000 hands once. But that hasn't been the case. This seems like another example of them trying to force micro-transactions.","April 21","false","49.5"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

I only have played this game for 4 minutes, but from what I get out of it is.\nIt's just a normal poker game, like the previous ones, and I loved to play those for a few minutes. I don't know if it adds much to the previous ones, but I know they did add a few things:\nIt has a multiplayer. Something that I wanted to be implemented in online poker games.\n(poker)friends list. Not  really necessary since this is on steam and you can already add friends this way. But I guess it makes it easier to find buddies to play with and maybe if steam's down you can still talk to your friends.\nShops. The bad in-game shop. You obviously need fake money to play a poker match, but you can buy those fake coins with real money. And it's not like they just have a page where every real money related things are, they push it in your face, NEW DEAL EXPIRES IN 16 HOURS, BUY COINS BEST PRICE. And then you also have premium money. Money you can't win by playing poker matches (from what I know), which you use to buy cosmetics.\nLet's talk about the pro's and cons\nPro'sQuite indept gameplay, I think. This is more based of fo GoP 1 and 2 as you can interact with the opponents using your character.\nCustomization. Customization is good but you do have to buy it with 'special' currency\nConsIt just puts you right in the game. What I mean with this is they don't tell you anything about the game itself until you win and exit the tourney.\nOdd betting. Betting in this game probably is pretty good, but in my perspective it's weird as hell. I couldn't figure out to bet a normal amount, only 1/2, 3/4, pot and all in.\nMircrotransactions\nOverall this game just feels like the average barely fun mobile game, even though it isn't. I just feel lucky ads don't pop up everytime you win a showdown.

Blackjack is a joke with the dealer frequently getting blackjack or 20 multiple times in a row with very brief breaks in between and the odds of winning poker if you aren't a fresh beginner to this game or have spent money on this game is slim to none. Definitely rigged when I sat in one tournament and saw two people with high stacks constantly alternating back and forth pushin all in with pure junk hands and winning knocking out people who actually had decent hands on the river.\n\nI've been seing stuff like this for the past few weeks of playing but didn't want to believe completely what people were saying about this game until today. I thought maybe I was just having a bad slump or something and the luck was eventually going to pick up until I saw that bs that happened today. Made me realize the others were correct in what they were saying about the game being rigged so people would spend more money on it. One review even stated that company reps admitted to them that there are bots in the game designed to push so people will bet more. Would definitely explain some of the things I've been seeing lately.\n\nThere's a reason why most of the negative reviews for this game are well worded describing issues they've seen while most of the positive reviews seem to be using bad english or short two or three word reveiws with no decent explanation. Usually when you see reviews like that it means they were planted to make the game look better than it actually is. Best part of this geam was uninstalling.","April 21","false","42.0"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

It has mircotransactions for gold coins and chips. The game gives you free chips 750 per 4th hour and the number will increase with your levels, when you win, when you level up and other times. Coins are earned by doing achivements. The coins can be used to buy accessorys for your male or female, btw it's only the top of them you see in the poker game and you can not costumise the poker player's physical atributes, but you can give him/her some ♥♥♥♥ on their hat like, flagg, star, heart and other items. If you do not do anything then the game will count it as you folding. You can open up bigger places later that needs bigger entry maximum and minimum pools, just choose how much your starting chips by the table is going to be within a limit. Try to bluff or outplay the others for your own gain.

You can earn daily chips; always find a game that will suit your needs. It's now known that there are bots that will play against you, and aggressively push you to spend more chips. I've found that this hasn't really impacted my play style, chip count or entertainment level. Seems a little shady if you are purchasing chips, but I wouldn't. Every day I win more and more so this seems to be a non-factor. You will also start off with a sizable welcome package which is plenty to get you winning!\n\nThe blackjack does suck; I've never been so unlucky when it comes to winning with 18-20 in hand! It should be at least a good chance you will win at that point. My biggest dislike in the game though is the chat! You can only choose from a set number of premade responses. The developers stated that adding a real chat would force them to raise the legal age of the game. Seems like a small price to pay for a feature that would add so much transparency. I'm calling ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t on that one!\n\nOverall, It's FREE. Bots of Not I'm having fun. You'll never need to buy chips either.\n\nAccidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful?

That doesn't mean the game does not come with the usual quirks associated with micro-transaction (free) games. And maybe I am being a bit biased because I was already a fan of Governor of Poker 2. Both games are very similar to each other. The major difference being that in GoP 3 you can now play online against human opponents. The money isn't real, but that feeling of playing with real people is what makes the game priceless. GoP 2 was single-player only, but it had one advantage over this game. You could buy properties, organize tournaments, and play against boss-characters. I still recommend it if you don't mind playing alone.\n\nYes GoP 3 does have a micro-transaction system, but it is not an obligation for enjoying yourself. You can buy extra chips and gold, but you can earn them in the game by playing regularly. Chips can be won at tables, and gold can be collected by unlocking in-game achievements. Experience points will also be rewarded and will be automatically used to level-up your character. This creates a good sense of game progression. You can spend gold on cosmetics such as hats, shirts, and buttons. These items are entirely optional but are a fun part of the game.\n\nAs you progress in rank more areas will be opened up to you where the stakes are greater and the players are slicker. Later you will compete in tournaments and earn trophies. Texas Hold'em poker is the primary game, but you can also play blackjack against the AI dealer. It's an easy way to get more money, but the dealer seems to cheat just like in a real casino. There are also "Sit & Go" tables where people are not allowed to drop in and out and the winner takes all. The buy-in is higher on those tables, but the payout and experience is worth it. One of the best variations for me, though, is "Spin & Go". It's similar to the other tables but the game spins a prize at the beginning (usually 5k chips or higher). Three players will then play for that prize. It's a fun and easy way to get a lot of chips.\n\nIf you are a fan of Texas Hold'em or high-stakes gambling with imaginary money then I recommend any game in the Governor of Poker series. If you prefer to play with real people then GoP 3 is the way to go!","May 29","true","14.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I've gotten so many headaches from involuntary eye-rolls while playing blackjack it's not even funny.  The dealer is trash, the odds are NEVER in your favor, and you will waste more chips than recieved, since it's so hard to ever get any wins whether it's in blackjack or poker. Also, the locked chat is dumb. Why play poker with others when you can't conversate? With that being said, there should be an option to turn off the chat completely as some like to spam, it's annoying and distracting. Even though this is a free game, I would suggest skipping it all together and playing literally ANY other poker game (like WSOP) instead. 0/10 would not waste my f*cking time again.","March 1","false","11.8"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Most poker sites do. It takes a ton of the strategy out of the game and makes it so you don't feel like you're playing against humans. I assume they do this because of the potential for harassment or something. It seems they don't have enough respect for their players to allow this.\n\n-I have encountered a bug multiple times where I'll win a big pot and not get all the money. It seems to only give me enough to restore me to my balance at the start of the hand.\n\n-It locks you out of lower stakes tables when you level up past a certain point. They do this so that you will eventually bust. They raise the stakes faster than your bank roll can increase unless you're incredibly lucky or skilled (obviously a tiny minority of players) so that eventually if you want to continue playing you will have to spend real-life-money on more in-game-currency.\n\n-Two currencies. Yes. It engages in that unbelievably anti-player practice of two currencies. Even though they stack everything against you in a way that guarantees you'll eventually need to buy back in with real-life-money just to play, they also have another stupid currency that you use to buy the cosmetic BS that they include as an incentive for excelling in the game. So if you were to spend real-life-money here it'd be a decision on which currency to buy that can only be somewhat educated, since understanding the relative values would require a lot of information they don't provide (of course)\n\n-Winning lots of money would be nice if it was able to be used to buy something. Even a player house that you could furnish/decorate/expand/etc. would be something. Or fancy cars or what ever.

You get $1,000 free chips a few times a day (that's not very many). For weeks I have logged in and used those chips at the Blackjack table. The sheer number of times the "dealer" has gotten 21 is mind boggling. It defies any types of realistic odds. Additionally, the frequency with which the "dealer" pulls a winning hand out of thin air is ridicullous. If you are dealt a 10 and an 8 and the dealer is showing a 3, rest assurred the dealer will draw a face card followed by a 6, every time.","June 5","false","4.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

DO NOT BUY CHIPS!!! (microtransactions are the devils work)\n2. DO NOT TAKE IT SO SERIOUSLY (it's a colourful cartoon game after all, not pokerstars or WSOP)\n3. DO NOT WORRY ABOUT PLAYING IN BIG CHIP CONTESTS (it's the same game no matter the price of the table)\n4. DO NOT BOTHER WITH BLACKJACK (unless your feeling like you could do with lightening your chip stack)\n5. PLAY FOR FUN (if you set up tables with friends at least the chips are just being passed around between you)\n6. KEEP CLAIMING YOUR FREE CHIPS WHEN YOU REMEMBER (it all helps and its free)\n7. DO NOT BUY CHIPS!!!!! (i've told you once, now blinking pay attention to this advice)\n\nAt the end of the day as long as you treat it as it advertises (FREE TO PLAY), don't get worked up by getting done over on a good hand more often than not and just have fun with it, it's quite good.\n\nBut if you want a serious and totally fair/even deck poker game then this is not it.","May 25","true","230.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

I might just have to buy something eventually just cause the game is so much fun I feel like I'm stealing it to not  pay anything :D\n\nThe game has several game modes:\nIt starts with two low buy-in tables, a 250 chip buy in table and a 1-5k buy in table, both have 5 seats at the table, which means small tables, you get to win more often!  The 250 table isn't available after you "level" to 13, which will happen eventually just playing the game... winning, losing, getting trophies, everything gets you experience.\n\nAfter those low buy in tables, you'll see your first "cashgame" saloon.  Cashgames have 8 seats, and turbo cashgames move a little faster because each player has less time to decide to bet/call/fold.\n\nThen you'll see you first "Sit and Go" table.  Sit and Go games have 5 seats, like the starter saloons, but there is a set fee to play.  The first Sit and Go game costs 10K to join, but when you sit at the table, you have 3k in chips.  You're then locked in that game, which has increasing blinds, meaning the game can't go on forever.  Eventually players lose all their chips, and the last two players standing win a prize.  Second place is the entry fee returned, and first place is 3.5 times the entry fee (35K at the first Sit and Go arena)\n\nNext is the first "Big Win" tournament.  Big Win games go on for 24 hours, or at least once I saw a 12 hour game, with 8 seats at the table.  The first Big Win has a 10K + 1K buy in, meaning you pay 11K, but get 10K in chips for the tournament.  Then you play as far as your chips will take you.  At the end of the time, your ranking in the tournament will determine if you win a prize or not.  10K chips won't win anything, so you have to improve from your start to have a chance of leaving the tournament with anything, because the chips in the tournament are only for score; you don't get to keep them after the game, but you'll get chips if you win a prize.\n\n"Push or Fold" is the next game type you'll see.  Push and Fold is like a very fast cash game, with 5 seats at the table.  The first has a buy in of 10K + 1K again, pay 11K chips to get 10K in game, but you can leave the game and take your chips with you in this one, unlike the Tournament. Push or Fold features very high blinds, so it is difficult to sit back and fold on your first two cards if you don't like them, because you'll go broke fast that way.\n\nThen further down the line, there is a "Royal Poker" saloon, which is a 5 seat table, where the deck has only 10 through ace cards... maybe a good place to try and get the rare Royal Flush achievement? I haven't played this game yet, as it has a big 150K buy in!\n\nAnd finally, if you click the little map to zoom out, you'll see a place to play blackjack.  No other players, just you and the dealer.  I played a little to get a couple of the blackjack trophies, but it was pretty dull for me.\n\nSpeaking of Trophies! Virtually anything you do in the game will earn you credit towards trophies.  For instance, your first win with a straight will get you a trophy! trophies earn you extra experience, as well as gold coins.\n\nGold coins?  Well, those are used to buy hats! yep! lots of cool hats to be found... the special VIP hats have animations and sometimes sounds, and are pretty cool, except the disco hat scares the crap out of me every time the guy wearing it wins cause it makes a lot of noise :D  You can also buy pins, roses, or other decorations for your hats, and you can buy different colored shirts.  If you play a girl character, the shirt color is also your glove color, so I got some pretty purple gloves, and a few cheap hats...forgot to mention those Big Win tourneys want you to wear different hats... there's usually a cheap hat you can buy and not spend a lot of gold.\n\nExperience? Yes, you gain levels in this game.  Looking at someone's level is a good way to get a general idea of how much they've played the game so far.  Everything you do earns stars.  1 star for losing a hand, more for winning.  Stars for trophies too.  I think you actually get a few chips for leveling up too.\n\nWant to spend some real money?  You don't have to, but if you run out of chips and don't want to wait for more free ones, you can buy chips, and there are always deals for cheaper chips too.  You can also buy gold, which is great if you want to support the game AND get one of those cool VIP hats I'm so envious of... considering how much I've played already, I'll probably buy some gold at some point and buy a neat hat.  Gold never seems to go on sale though, which is disappointing\n\nSocial system:  The game doesn't have a direct chat system, so you can't talk to other players using your own words, however, there are emotes and short quotes you can say as you wish, stuff like "nice bluff" and "well played" or if you're more trolly "scared?" or maybe just post a face sticking your tongue out at them... I like this system personally, as I don't care for angry trolls, or people talking about what cards they have, or stuff like that, but if you're looking to make lifelong friends, it is pretty hard to do just posting giggle faces at each other :D\n\nA last note on free chips: you can get them both by waiting on the 4 hour timer, and by making friends, and getting gifts from them.  Friends can only give you 100 chips at a time, once a day, and you're limited in how many total gifts you can give out a day too, but it is something in addition to the 4 hour timer if you're really broke and desperate for your poker fix.\n\nSome complaints I have about the game:\n1. Gold never on sale! Come on Devs! chips are always, always on sale...why not gold??\n\n2. EDIT: this bot issue I discussed was fixed, so you'll no longer see the bots.  For a while the bots which were only supposed to appear to new players in the 1-5K poker shack, first two hands, instead stuck around while other players joined the table, which caused more experienced players to see the bots too.  These bots now all leave the table after feeding the new player some chips in the first two hands, before experienced real people are allowed to join that table.  I am still mildly disappointed that the new player gets tricked into playing against unlabled bots, but it is only for two hands, and the hands are supposed to help feed the new player some chips so...\n\n3. I...uh...forgot... if I remember I'll come back here and edit again :D\n\nWhat I like about the game:\n1. Free Poker!\n\n2. Fun Poker!\n\n3. Winning! at Poker!\n\nI hope this long review helps people decide to try out this fun and exciting game.\n\nEDIT: changed this from a short 3 line review to a genuine full review of the game...hope it is enjoyed!\n\nEDIT 2: changed the cons bots section, to explain the update that eliminated bots in the beginning poker shack after the first two hands as a new player.","February 20","true","30.8"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

It's not real money first of all, so don't worry, it's legal AND free, all the more reason to play this game! It's so easy to simply run this game and just relax. You start off with a good amount of chips and depending how you play it's easy to win, and it's easy to lose. This is nice though because you can buy chips with real money BUT you also get $1000 in chips every 4 hours (Have to log on and collect it though).\n\nIf you're a fan of Texas Hold 'em and Blackjack, by all means get this. If you've never played either card game, this is a good start regardless of your age, however I recommend being a bit older if you want to play this. I will say though if you have a bad habit with gambling a lot, this will not be so good for you :)\n\nTopic: Casual Gambling Simulation\n\n\nReplayabilityGreatPrice TagFREEAge groupTeens & AdultsDevsHelpful & Responsive\n\nSingleplayer8Community8Multiplayer9Gameplay9Controls9Graphics7Sound7Casual8Gambling10Simulation7\nScore: 82/100\n\nThanks for reading!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/easelm/recommended/436150/","easelm","Easelm","http://steamcommunity.com/id/easelm/","246 products in account","Originally posted by ABOUT:Governor of Poker 3 is the best free multiplayer poker game with a great design. In this multi-player version of Governor of Poker you compete live with thousands of real poker players to prove you are the best and number 1 Texas Hold ’em poker star!\n\nBecoming a poker pro is a long journey through Texas; you will start as a rookie and work yourself all the way up to become a VIP poker player, a high roller to end up winning high stake games in the Gold area.\nGovernor of Poker 3 released on Steam Feb. 19th, 2016. Minor bugs here and there, but let's not get ahead of ourselves. If you look at other poker games on Steam they are either not multiplayer or way too pricey to even consider buying, especially when review negativity is quite high. I've been looking for a great poker game on Steam and I've found it besides Tabletop Simulator.\n\nIf you're looking for a great poker game, you've found it so stop looking. It is free. It is an MMO. Play. YOUR. HEART. OUT.\n\nThe beginning of Governor of Poker 3 goes through a minor tutorial telling you what to do with whatever it is pointing at. They start you off with $35,000 and level 1. You can choose to play Blackjack (alone) or play poker with hundreds if not thousands of people and a ton of money at stake. If you are new to poker I'm sure you'd be a master player before that $35,000 ran out. There's a helper sheet that tells you what is a pair, two pair, three of a kind, etc.\n\nAfter you are ready to head out and start playing, each "place" requires X level to unlock and participate in. These "places" to play poker in are in specific areas. Once you start going up in level you unlock certain places that have high buy-ins to play with a great amount of money.\n\nPlay tournaments and hope you will win. Tournaments have quite big buy-ins and if you lose you don't buy back in. Take as much money as possible and be wise about it, blinds can go up very high and drain your money until you have none left. Show your poker face!\n\nGovernor of Poker 3 has micro-transactions. Before you go all crazy judging the game saying it is "Pay to Win" - let's review. You can purchase gambling money with real money or you can purchase gold currency with real money and buy accessories for your character. You can buy hats, clothes and other stuff to add to your character. Win your money gambling or buy it off the store, there's nothing to worry about. I'd recommend purchasing money off the store if it is very cheap, because it goes as low as $1. Or, you can wait X amount of hours and get your free money on the bottom left of the selection menu before you gamble.\n\nThere's quite an elaborate achievement system. Basically anything you do will probably earn you an achievement. If that's not enough each achievement earned will allow you to collect a reward which might include gold and experience. This not only includes in-game achievements, but also Steam achievements as well.\n\nThe experience you will gain in Governor of Poker 3 will be great. Play with millions, get involved, add some as your friends. Try out this free to play poker game now, you won't regret it.\n\nOverall:If you are looking for a FREE multiplayer poker game this is the one for you. Bet, Raise, and Bluff your way to the top on this poker game.\n\nRating: 4/5\n\nReviewed on: Nomsoft[www.nomsoft.net]","February 21","true","16.0"," 2 of 11 people (18%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","18","2","11","0","0"

But you are given a decent amount of chips to start and some coins for no charge.  Also, every 4 hours you get more chips, mine shows 750 when I finally reach the 4 hour mark of playing.  I think if you play like you were playing for real money, you will be able to keep a decent stack of chips to play with without buying any.  They do put the chips and coins on sale throughout the time your playing.  So if you like to play poker, this is another alternative to play with other steam players.  I kind of liked this as a break from pokerstars or some of the facebook games you can play, but they sell chips too.  So, if you were to buy some chips once in a while, better to support this developor on steam I think.  So I would recommed the game as I enjoyed the first 2 stand alone games.  Just don't go to crazy with the all ins all the time like a lot of players do on there.","February 19","true","10.1"," 1 of 9 people (11%) found this review helpful","11","1","9","0","0"

Sure, it's not the samething but there's progression - leaderboards to fight over if that's your thing. The game doesn't take itself seriously; I enjoy that aspect and I hate it at the sametime. I appreciate a game that can look at itself and give the finger on a few things but a lot of players look towards games with a clean shave and haircut.\n\nWhy else invest time in a game that doesn't take itself seriously? Could mean a short life span and not worth the time (looking at the number 3 in the title). I think treating it as goofy as they make it be is our best bet and maybe soon enough we'll get that clean barber shaved poker game sometime later on.

Sure, it's not the samething but there's progression - leaderboards to fight over if that's your thing. The game doesn't take itself seriously; I enjoy that aspect and I hate it at the sametime. I appreciate a game that can look at itself and give the finger on a few things but a lot of players look towards games with a clean shave and haircut.\n\nWhy else invest time in a game that doesn't take itself seriously? Could mean a short life span and not worth the time (looking at the number 3 in the title). I think treating it as goofy as they make it be is our best bet and maybe soon enough we'll get that clean barber shaved poker game sometime later on. This will do for now.\n\nStill good as hell, just play it.","February 20","true","32.4"," 1 of 9 people (11%) found this review helpful","11","1","9","0","0"

The UI is really in your face at first, but you get used to it quick.\n\nIt's simply poker. Multiplayer. Done well.\n\nIf you want the solo experience, get Governer of Poker 2, which is also excellent with quite realistic AI. I have about 30 hours in that while online and I can imagine me wasting away many hours in this.\n\nAlso to people complaining about the need to buy chips with real world money. You don't have to. Chips spawn every few hours. A nice sum to get you back. Chips need to have scarcity or poker won't work.
