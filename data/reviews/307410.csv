The controls are shoddy, the fights are short and pointless and I find the entire game to be an insult to Capoeira. I would understand if the game was in PreAlpha, but it has been around for about 2 years before coming to Steam so the windo for improving it has been open for a long time. The only reason I can see for this pile of rubbish being released is to coincide with the world cup being held in Brazil. double thumbs down from a very disappointed fan of Capoeira","June 13, 2014","false","0.3"," 90 of 100 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","90","100","2","1"

You have no health rather it is it like a tug o' war and you need to balance not getting tired.\n\nThe reason for the the thumbs down is the lack of any graphic options even basic resolution. There is also no key remapping or controller support.","June 13, 2014","false","3.5"," 56 of 74 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","56","74","0","5"

The game lags, there are already zero to no options, and then the music options reverse now and then, blowing my ears out.\nNext to that, I was doing career and boom, after three matches my character just stood there.... doing nothing, while the other person was trying to hit me... which did not happen.  After a few minutes I quit playing story mode, and then I noticed that when I do the tutorial, you learn instead of 5 techniques, 3 techniques at the basic technique tutorial... and then it suddenly stops and I get back in the main menu with the settings again on full, once again blowing my ears out. Just... bad for my 10 euro's.","July 2, 2014","false","1.0"," 19 of 27 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","19","27","0","0"

I thought this game was going to be crappy shovelware, but it's actually pretty good. It's accurate to the practice of capoiera, the controls are fairly responsive (They're a little stiff, but I think they were trying to simulate the rhythm of the berimbau, meaning you can't just hammer away at buttons.)\n\n\nThe only thing that's really goofy is the cast of characters: I mean seriously, you have a Jamaican character nicknamed AMAZON and some John Cena looking ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Only one Brazilian dude's even in this game\n\n\n7/10","December 8, 2015","true","0.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Heads up there is no controler support and the key bindings r "W A S D" to move and the action buttons r "H J B N and SPACE"  It takes a little getting used to.  I would only recommend getting this game when it's on sale and if u like martial arts or capoeira cause the reality is there isn't much appeal to the game.","May 11, 2015","true","8.7"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","44","4","9","3","0"
