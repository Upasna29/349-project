Select one of four unique armors, choose from over 200 weapons, and get ready to kick some major bug butt.\n\nOnce on the field, the commentary between allies and the tips provided by the higher ups will have you laughing everytime.\n\nAs for those that typically avoid ports for their many faults and issues, you'll find none of that here.

Also it isn't as cheesy and funny\n\nI like the different classes, although they play differently they're fun and fairly easy to get around with, unlike 2025 where you get your @ss kicked if you play with anything other than the base class (at least at first). There's plenty of different weapons, each one with advantages and disadvantages that will keep you hooked, looking for the best combo.\nI dont like that it takes so long to level up a class to the max, and the campaign could be longer.\n\nOverall is a fun game, and if you like 3rd person shooters you might like it","February 3, 2015","true","14.4"," 26 of 29 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","26","29","0","1"

Do you like killing gigantic monsters and aliens that take up your whole screen? Then get this game. It's definitely worth the price it's at and extremely fun but I'd recommend bringing a friend or two along and take note that the co-op is only 3 players. But the wave defense mode can go up to 6. All in all if playing as cool looking soldiers with four different classes who kill gigantic alien bugs and huge bosses. All while having an epic arsenal at your hands sounds fun, then this is definitely the game for you. It does only have three chapters with 5 decently lengthed missions each in them so the game itself is kinda short but definitely does have some replayability like the different difficulties. I'd recommend starting on normal but after you get your characters leveled up boost it up to the next ones and try playing again. The game becomes much more challenging almost dreadfully so. I give it an 8/10.","December 16, 2013","true","4.8"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","19","21","0","0"

You are pitted against endless amounts of ants, tarantulas, ticks, and more because they are trying to end all life on the earth. I mean, come on. That sounds awesome, and it is. The story is lame, but the game play is pretty solid.  I really liked the different classes that had differing strengths and abilities. It adds a bit more flavor to game. Oh, and don't get me started on the arsenal. It's overwhelming. A plethora of weapons from , If I am correct, around six categories.  Now imagine all that, but with friends. It's a damn good time. The co-op adds so much more fun and I loved the survival mode. Literally endless amounts of bugs versus you and whoever you wish to tag along. And as for bugs, I encountered millions (haha get it? Humor). But the bugs that ruin a game? I encountered none. It ran smoothly and nothing hindered me from enjoying the game. It's cheap, fun action. $10 is a steal of a price, so if it goes on sale pick it up instantly. It might BUG you if you don't (I'm funny). Oh, and if you like weapons be sure to pick the DLC as well because it adds more of them which is always a good time.","March 20, 2014","true","6.2"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","0"

However, for fans of the series, this will leave you with a bitter taste in the mouth, as it's nowhere as fun or as long as the other games of the series - some could even say that it's somewhat unfinished. Instead of giving you a lot of missions, they've replaced it with an equipment grind-fest and missions that are nowhere near as epic as the ones from previous games - heck, there's not even an "EDF! EDF!" chant anywhere to be found.

I ended up buying 2 copies during a sale so my gf and I could play together.\n\nSecond, lame tone/aesthetic. This game was developed by Vicious Cycle Software, a western developer who, from what I can tell, has never made a decent game.  They took the kaiju tone of the originals and tried to turn it into a meathead military game. Gone is the simplicity of shooting and diving. Gone are the slightly too loud sound effects of picking up power-ups and navigating the menus. Gone are the physics that result in bouncing ant carcasses. Gone is the awful dialogue spouted by your fellow soldiers, well maye not gone but not as enjoyably terrible. The missions are longer and this may appeal to some but I prefer the plentiful bite size missions of the previous games.\n\nIt's just a let down.

It doesn't have the free-roam element like it did in Earth Defense Force 2017. In EDF 2017 you could choose where you wanna go first while clearing the map.

It doesn't have the best graphics, no... But why in the hell should that matter if your looking for a FANTASTIC game.\n\nThe game revolves around big ♥♥♥ alien bugs and machines, massive explossions that can and WILL level every building in sight. The bugs are BIG, BAD, and they SWARM. If there was ever an enemy that uses it's numbers to overwhelm you, this is it.\n\nThere are 4 main classes, and ALL of them are unbeleivably well balanced. Want a Jet pack? Check. How about a heavy with an energy sheild that absorbs damage, shocks enemies, and if surrounded detonates a small nuke? Check. Or how about a sniper who can massicare the massive swarm of enemies from afar without ever smelling them? Check... or how about your average Joe soldier who just HAPPENS to be able to hold every kind of weapon imaginable? Check.\n\nThe weapons... oh the weapons. So many weapons and gun turrets and oh, did I mention they have tanks? No? Well they do... and sometimes, you will need them. BAD. especially when your up against enemies that are a little over 15 stories tall and shoot lazers out their asses while dropping giant jumping spiders who happen to have giant ant friends, that have flying hornet friends... and yest they're also giant... who happen to have flying machines that swarm and suicide bomb you when they're too damaged to fight... who happen to have more friends who are just bigger... and Biggers... and BIGGER... You see where I'm going with this?\n\nOh yes and... there is a rocket launcher that happens to be able to level 6 city blocks...\n\nBut hey if your not into that sort of fast paced, unforgiving, brutal, and adreniline pumping action with 3 player co-op then hey.

I couldn't imagine that they really did something wrong with the PC version (EDF Insect Armagedon) but they messed it up. The other EDF's are large, you have tons of levels and 4 difficulty to repeat. You find constantly armor to improve health and at least a dozen weapons per level. Not in EDF Insect Armagedon. I played it through within 3 hours (first of 3 difficulties)! You find weapons but only from special monsters (just a view per level if at all) and you have to unlock them with experience points. Additionally all weapons of the same kind (rocket launcher, assault rifle ...) look identically. No matter if your rocket launcher shoots one missle or 10 homing missle at once: it looks the same (this is different in the other EDF). The exciting item hunt where you felt like a real badass got a lame and boring game. I guess fans of the series still have some fun in multiplayer but the game cant compete with its brothers on xbox360 and ps3.

It's just a terrible single player experience.\nI bought it primarily because I wanted a single player game where I slaughter waves of enemies, and hence my review is from that perspective. I could see how this game could be very fun with a few friends.\npros- the armor classes look cool\n- when it's not being unfair it can be very fun\n- some humor and funny lines that will make you laugh\n- A lot of content for a game of this price\ncons\n- Weapons look way to similar, and have names you can't possibly remember and look nearly identical (even the icons) meaning it's easier to just remember what ammo/damage the weapon did if you want to swap in and out. (a minor issue but still irritating)\n-Constantly unfair meaning you'll die too often not from hordes of insects, but from a single powerful blow from one of the stronger enemies, that wipes half your half.\n-Many of the machines that spawn other enemies take too long to die. It's not difficult to survive, they simply take way too long to die which gets old very fast.\n-Friendly AI is just pathetic and love to run in front of you while you're unleashing a barrage of grenades/missiles which ends up damaging you from the proximity to the blast.\n-when the 'ticks' latch on to you, you need to mash E (or whatever you have it set to) I really wish games wouldn't do this, I have no interest in wearing out my keyboard (another minor point)\n\n\nSummary: it's not the worst game ever, I didn't enjoy my time for the most part so that's why I don't recommend, but I would say to anyone who knows a friend who wants to play it or already has it, for 11$ it's not bad and I would recommend it.","May 16, 2015","false","83.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Shooting games where you fight giant insects is a rarity, so points for a concept that hasn't been explored much. The game aslo has a grand sense of scale, with huge buildings getting destroyed as collateral in the fights and huge boss-type foes that are taller than lots of the buildings themselves. It also usually introduces a new enemy or a new vehicle every mission (at least for a while). Although far from a perfectly implemented, the game also gives the player several classes with their own abilities, and the ability to change your gun loadout between missions.\n\nHowever, this game has a number of problems. First, it is extremely repetitive. There is very little variance in mission objectives. It's always go here, kill all the constantly spawning enemies, repeat. There's little in terms of varied environments; Where you are on the map has almost no effect on how any given situation is approached. Combat is also repetitive, with waves and waves of the same four enemy types with an occasional bullet sponge boss. Waves of enemies tend to go on for entirely too long, and I found myself wishing for a change of scenery halfway through most of the firefights. As mentioned, most of the bosses are bullet sponges, not particularly difficult to defeat, but it takes a very very long time. Only occasionally are boss battles fun.\n\nThe system of armor classes and unlockable weapons is a nice thought, but it is poorly implemented. Weapons can be found on the battlefield, usually after killing some boss monster. However, weapons are also divided into tiers, and even after collected can only be unlocked via leveling up the armor class that uses said weapon. The problem with this is that it can take too long to level up. If you change your armors for the sake of varying the gameplay, level ups are few and far in between, so the weapons you pick up become unused, and the enemies become increasingly durable (the game uses skin swapped versions of some enemies with more health later in the game). Either the game becomes repetitive because it gradually  takes more time to kill enemies or it becomes repetitive by sticking to the same class.\n\nOverall, the game has some good ideas, but most are not very well implemented. Some people might find enjoyment from this game, but the giant bug novelty isn't enough to salvage the gameplay","April 4, 2014","false","5.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

However for those who have not had the chance yet to experence EDF, you will not exactly be blown away with this one. Unfortunately it lacks immersion, gameplay, graphics, optimisation, sound, weapon quality, enemy AI and general quality, and thats just the top of the iceberg. It's whole foundation compared to the rest of the franchise is just dripping wet with nonsense.\n\nYou may think this then to be a negative review, and typically you would be right, but I still had fun playing it. Still had fun bringing down the bosses, still had fun collecting the weapons and leveling up and still had fun rolling through the game again after completing it. Ultimately I have to recommend this title even with it's flaws as it still anchors onto the EDF franchise and there is a smidge of amusement to squeeze out if you want it.\n\nIn summary, Earth Defence Force: Insect Armageddon is a title that under-shot it's potential to be a good game, and landed firmly in the OK camp.

It's not a 'real' EDF game as it was outsourced to an entirely different studio halfway across the world but thankfully they understood enough to keep things goofy. The biggest departure from the Sandlot EDFs is this game's modern Western mission structure where it's all waypoints and overt setpieces as well as the odd (infuriating) linear vehicle segment. It kind of made me realize the canon EDFs are a lot better designed than they typically get credit for as they manage to get a lot of these moments to happen organically (like, in IA there will be an anthill and a prompt for you to stick a bomb on after which a counter starts running and you have to deflect waves of insects until it blows. In canon EDF there would just be an anthill with bugs streaming out so you end up deciding for yourself to wade in and destroy it so they'll stop coming.

Despite the technical issues which I will go into further in detail, the game is surprisingly fun, albeit a little frustrating at times. First and foremost, the controls are a little jenky. Plain and simple. They do not always respond the way you want to, however, they are not terrible. The teammate A.I. is horrible. In a game where you are getting swamped left and right literally hundreds, if not more, enemies at once, your teammates ability to hold their own is very important... and the A.I. completely drops the ball. They are inaccurate, will just stand there soaking up damage and dying a quick death and also, for some reason, seem to have an inability to revive you if you fall in battle. This is especially problematic in major boss battles where you are getting swamped with 2 or more boss enemies and the usual barrage of hundreds of normal enemies and when there are few wide spread checkpoints in the level.\n\nAll this being said however, the game is unusually fun and entertaining despite these issues. There is something gratifying each time you make an enemy go splat and a great sense of accomplishment when you do actually complete a level. The charterer leveling system is fulfilling as well. Each tier unlocks new weapons, deployables and upgrades, which in turn makes playing single player more enjoyable and less frustrating. The game really shines in co-op mode however and makes most of the technical issues much more bearable. The story is really not anything that special. It is pretty much just an excuse to blow away tons of abnormally large insects, arachnids and aliens... which is just fine as long as you know what you are getting into.\n\nFinal verdict: Despite the technical flaws the game is a fun kill fest that is worth the minimal money it costs.  4/5 stars","November 13, 2012","true","6.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

First this was made by a DIFFRENT developer than the other EDF games. This game is a mess it takes everything that makes a EDF game and throws it out the window, the way the bullets stop 10 feet infront of you and dissapear the reload system blows its a Gear of War type of system. The way you get new weponds suck in the other EDF games you get random drops for killing the bugs and stuff and you get new ones that way it was cool cause there was over 150 of them. This game alot lacks scale the levels and super small not to mention the destruction sucks and its really just overall a buggy game, do yourself a favor and buy a 360 and play EDF 2017 or get 2025 for 360 and PS3 you will see what i mean.","December 11, 2014","false","0.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game overall is good, but not worth the price of full admission, and here is why:\n\nPros\n+Graphics\n+Engine\n+Keyboard/Mouse & Controller support\n+Online Co-Op\n+4 Different Player Classes\n\nCons\n-Very Short Game\n-Singular setting (no Fields, Undeground, Metropolis variants, or Beach settings\n-Not Giant Mechas/Godzillas\n-Certain weapons are tied to certain Classes\n\nOk, so overall the game is NOT as good as EDF 2017. Sure, the game looks great, but the designs are highly "western". They've removed those chromed Hectors and flying ships (like in 1950s sci-fi movies) for more Americanized grimdark enemies. Very little color in the game at times, ants and spiders practically blend into the Detroit setting (which is the ONLY setting). You play a very short amount of levels in city that looks the same. No green fields with small buildings, no ravines, no beach areas, no different city changes, no underground missionss.\n\nIt plays like EDF, it sort of looks like EDF, but honestly its not worth the current 9.99 price of admission. If you can get it for 4.99, go for it if you're wanting some gun-and-run action. I would not recommend this to 1st timers, but a fan of the series might enjoy it.","July 7, 2014","false","6.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

Even with the rose-tinted glasses of having played and immensely enjoyed the original EDF. The first had its good and bad points, but it was the good points that salvaged the game's bad ones. Yes, repetative gameplay is pretty much the staple of this series, but it never got too boring because of the campy, B-horror tone, the hilarious enemy physics (dead ants bouncing gloriously into the heavens) and the scale and variety of the creatures.\n\nUnfortunately, IA seems to have decided to do away with all that. Gone is the humor. Replaced with a more serious (but still somehow silly) gritty approach. Gone are the physics and the scale. Gone is the variety (well, you get some variety...if you like Spider Type A, B, C. Mix that up with Bee Type A, B, C, etc.). It's nice to have larger maps to explore, but they're hardly inventive or varied enough.

After my first 15 hours, I got bored and wrote a rather bad review. However, after dusting the game out of forgotten diskspaces for a second time, I actually found it rather enjoyable and when I got my two gaming buddies to get it, it turned into a blast. (Literally)\n\nSo, let's take a look at the game itself, shall we:\nEDF is a franchise that was actually around a bit longer, but usually console-exclusive. EDF:IA is (afaik) the sole PC-avaible title of the franchise.\nThe original franchise relies on 'So bad it's good again'-style of voice acting, cinematics, plot and really doesn't try to take itself too seriously. Combine that with a full-arcade 'omg shoot the aliens' exploding spamfest, and you got a rough draw of what EDF does.\nThis specific instance of the instance is, as mentioned, the only PC title and, sadly, wasn't developed by the original developers, but by a foreign group. And many fans complain that EDF:IA is nowhere near as good as any of the old titles and a bad joke compared to EDF:2025 (one of the more recent titles).\n\nEDF:IA itself is straight forward: Aliens invade Earth, you are an elite soldier group with absurd weapons utilizing endless ammo, and now fight your way through a 15-mission campaign. Doing so, you unlock more and more powerful weapons, till killing the enemies actually becomes a sidequest next to leveling the entire battlefield. Because that is what you can literally do: Level the (exclusive) city-maps to a heap of rubble. And damn, that's satisfying. Especially because your teammate is a jettrooper direly trying to get into a high spot.\nAs with it's ancestors, the main progression point of EDF:IA lies in unlocking new weapons for the four playable classes. Not that every class comes with 5-6 weapon categories, with dozens of (often unique) weapons each, from which you can bring exactly 2 to each mission.\nStandard assault rifles? Sure. SMG's for the Tac Officer? Jep. Rocket Launchers? Duh! BIG rocket launchers? Too.\nTactical Nuclear missile launchers which fires rockets slower then a hulking heavy? Included. Giant multi-missile 8-tuble super-sized nuclear flare ANTI-AIR rockets? Je, this game goes silly at times.\n\nOf course, the game DOES have a fair number of downpoints: First off, it's limited campaign. You get one campaign of 15 missions, which maybe cover ~3-5 hours. Then you get a 'Campaign Remix' which plays on the same maps, but with different objectives and enemy groupings. And lastly a rather crude Survival mode. The game offers 3 difficulty degrees which SEVERELY ramp up said difficulty: On Normal, you have to put effort into actually dieing. On Hard, you will despare in the first mission because those tiny ant enemies suddenly survive your best rocket launchers and actually kill you in a few hits. On Inferno... let's say I didn't yet make it into Inferno.\nCreativity in enemy design is another weak suit of the game: You get Ants. Spiders. Ticks. Wasps. Robots. Then you get Robot Ants, Robot Spiders, Robot Wasps. And another Robot Spider. The game tries to compensate for that by making jokes via the radio. "Hey intel, what can you give us on this new enemy?" "Well, it seems to be... a robot ant! Probably faster, better stronger and more dangerous." "... Thanks, intel..."\nAnd, one of my biggest complaints, is the stupid AI for your squadmates. When playing solo, your team will be filled up (toggleable though) with AI troopers which are... simplistic. They follow you around, shoot aliens with a rather solid accuracy and do their job quite well on Normal, dieing occasionally. On Hard, however, the AI dies rather regularyly, because it doesn't grasp the concept of dodging attacks, or eventually avoiding those incoming instakill carpet bombers. From what I'Ve heard, it becomes completely useless in Inferno.\n\nWhich clearly states one thing: This is a MULTIPLAYER COOP GAME, to the core. And boy, once I got my buddies into buying this, we had loads of fun blowing up aliens, buildings, each other and some more aliens. And AI teammates, occasionally. But mostly aliens.\nOf course the game has no terribly comlex depth, past organizing a solidly spread out weapon layout, assigning directions/roles to the team (F.e. the heavy battle suit takes care of the frontline, the tac provides carpet bombing support with his launcher and the jet keeps an eye out from above and snipes distant enemies) and learning the bosses' movement patterns to avoid the hard-hitting special attacks.\nBut the sheer amount of enemies and the intense difficulty ramp-up make the game very challenging, nontheless. (Or maybe the fact one of my teammates keeps insisting on using the 9999 damage missile launcher which oneshots most enemies and players alike, and keeps killing either himself or somebody else.)\n\n\nFinal judgement? 7/10\nSolid game, not as good as I would have hoped for, and judging by the countless critique definitely not a high point of it's franchise. But if you get two buddies to play it with, you will very well be busy fragging robot ants for dozens of hours to come. And for a price of mere 10€, this makes it a really nice budget purchase.\nIf you see it on sale (which I doubt, because this was never on sale, ever), it's a must have!","June 16, 2014","true","49.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

And, in my opinion, if a game doesn't pull you in within the first few hours, then it's usually a game that's not worth the money, or full price, depending on the situation. The game itself has mediocre graphics, ok sounds and very basic gameplay. It basically all comes down to shooting as many insects as you can. Later on the enemies get increasingly harder but that's about it. There is a bit of tactic involved by selecting your weapons and armor before you start a mission and you'll level up by completing levels. It just... gets very repetitive.\nI can name a dozen mindless shooters that ARE fun.\n\n[Rating: 66/100]","January 1, 2012","false","1.1"," 3 of 14 people (21%) found this review helpful","21","3","14","0","0"

First, there is a severe lack of missions. EDF IA has a total of 15 missions. I believe EDF 2017 had around 60 missions of crazy bug shooting, giant robot destroying, campy sci-fi goodness. Yeah, I like that there's a survival mode and a 'remix' of the campaign but I'm sure the devs could've cranked out more than 15 missions. The graphics aren't bad, but EDF was never about having 'amazing' graphics, considering the sheer amount of stuff happening on-screen you hardly have time to notice as you're running from an army of ants and spiders while dodging the blasts of robots that are towering over skyscrapers. The weapons and different soldier types are pretty cool too, and I'm glad to see that the devs decided to bring some variety in that form. I'll recommend this game if it's on sale, but at full price it's kind of hard to suggest, especially when this game has paid DLC, which was a horrible idea for this game. PAID DLC should not have come anywhere NEAR this franchise. In the end, however, this is EDF for the PC and that's quite alright. I just wish it was the EDF that I fell in love with on the Xbox360.","January 1, 2015","true","11.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The FOV is unchangable (This is a 3rd person game, why do you even need more FOV?). Game is capped at 30 FPS (I'd like it to be uncapped, but the game runs pretty smooth. Only notice the 30 fps cap in multiplayer matches but its not really that bad. Its something I'm sure someone will fix). This game has Poor Graphics.(If you've played the console version of this game or EDF 2017, you'd know this game isn't about looking pretty. Its no Uncharted or MW3 or BF3 lol, its about slaughtering giant bugs and robot invading earth in instanced based missions and it does that part well. There really isn't much of a story, and this one doesn't have as many missions as the first game. This one however has more weapons and class based armors.) Co Op too\n\n\nwhile its priced at 20$ pretty much for PC, the Console version is still 40$, that alone makes this better.","December 15, 2011","true","14.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It'll throw you into the level straightt away with no cutscenes. First you are just fighting ants then next thing you are fighting these Tyfoo fighters things.\n\nThe Survival mode is good too. It gets challenging wave after wave.\n\nThe only down bit of the game I can think of is there's no local split screen for the PC version like there is on the Xbox 360 version.\n\nOverall though, the game is good.","June 21, 2015","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

On its own, however, I believe it to be a solid game, doing exactly what it sets out to in a more than playable fashion.\n\nEven Serious Sam has a difficult time comparing to the sheer scale of Earth Defense Force's battles, where the smallest of enemies is at least the size of the player and the largest stand as tall as an apartment building. With hordes in excess of hundreds at almost every turn and the player's arsenal constantly increasing in shock value and near-absurdity, things can get a bit more than hectic.\n\nIn terms of variety, EDF is a mixed bag. Much of the combat begins to drag on as the game enters the later stages of the oddly short campaign - doable in roughly seven hours by one's lonesome - as the relatively limited selection of enemies begins to show through.\nIn terms of weapon and playstyle variety, however, I would draw a considerable amount of comparisons to Borderlands. There are an enormous amount of interesting weapons, ranging from run-of-the-mill assault rifles to airburst missiles that rain smaller warheads down on their targets after detonation. Four different classes, such as the unmatchably maneuverable Jet and the nigh-unkillable Battle, give good options for players of all persuasions.\n\nGraphically, the game is another toss-up. The streets of the cities feel somewhat empty and undetailed and, while undoubtedly pretty to watch and true game-changers for the battlefield environment, the collapse of buildings leaves much to be desired in their wake. Skyscrapers end up leaving little but a neatly-confined pile of rubble, cars explode piecelessly, and the thousands of enemies slaughtered in the campaign leave little but a brief, fading corpse - which, humorously, is often sent hurtling into space by some of the higher tier weapons.\nHowever, much of the model work is definitely up to par, and while the lack of graphical options and locked framerate makes the game feel much like a console port, the game runs flawlessly.\n\nThird party support, unfortunately, seems to be nonexistent. There's not much else to be said here; unless I've simply failed to find it, there's no possibility of a modding community for any but the most die-hard fans.\n\nIn the end, at its cheap price point of $10 USD, it'd be hard to turn this game down. If you're looking for something with longevity, that price point may be less exciting. Even still, for someone looking for a quick, frantic, larger-than-life game that charmingly follows every cliché in alien invasion movies, this is most definitely the game to be sought.","February 14, 2013","true","57.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are a few things that make me sad, weapons are earned through leveling, not being one of countless dudes. But the balance of still finding weapons on occasion, the very fact you get to level up something other than your health bar, and the addition of various armors that grant abilities and buffs is pretty awesome.\n\nIt also adds a huge degree of replayability. The game ends about where I would put the halfway point of campaign, but that being said there is a lot of awesome stuff happening. The ability to pretty easily play with any friends that have it makes for a very enjoyable time.  I prefer the heavy battle armor and massive destruction of missles, but the jet armor will let you fly around, and the tactical armor allows you to drop turrents. EDF is mostly about fun. It's a grind about killing giant bugs and doesn't throw too many suprises or puzzling things your way. That being said I highly reccomend this game if for no other reason than the sheer aggression and letting of steam qualities.

Three players coop with a basic leveling system it allows the player to simply jump in equip some weapons and then go all out against humanities ennemies.\n\nFour classes to play from each with their own abilities and weapons(though similarities for the weapons will be obvious for some) three chapters with five missions each give you a good taste of what Earth defence force is about. The varying degrees of difficultie make the game a fresh challenge with its basic in missions objective give you something better to do then "Kill every ennemies on the map" style.

The FOV is unchangable (This is a 3rd person game, why do you even need more FOV?). Game is capped at 30 FPS (I'd like it to be uncapped, but the game runs pretty smooth. Only notice the 30 fps cap in multiplayer matches but its not really that bad. Its something I'm sure someone will fix). This game has Poor Graphics.(If you've played the console version of this game or EDF 2017, you'd know this game isn't about looking pretty. Its no Uncharted or MW3 or BF3 lol, its about slaughtering giant bugs and robot invading earth in instanced based missions and it does that part well. There really isn't much of a story, and this one doesn't have as many missions as the first game. This one however has more weapons and class based armors.)

It has 4 classes of quite different experiences, some minor RPG leveling and weapon purchasing elements, and a robust campaign. Although the campaign has kind of an abrupt ending, it's not really an issue as the entire point of this game is bug squashing. Do you like choosing between dozens of different types of guns, anywhere from launchers, rockets, sniper rifles, shotguns, assault rifles, and so many weird types of weapons that there's something for everyone. I change up my weapons frequently. The environments are destructible as well, so most of those weaopns will decimate all the buildings as well. I find playing this game very carthardic, as it takes little effort to play it and isn't terribly frustrating as long as you treat the difficulty settings like Diablo ones. Start normal, level up and get better weaopns and more health, then move to the next difficulty. I recmmend getting 1 level below the level cap per each difficulty.

I can say that this game has given me and my steam mates some of the best laughs.\n\nNothing beats shooting spiders with small nuc's. And when you can do it with mates, all the better.\n\nThe 4 classes vary widely. There is, Tactical (Support), Heavy (Tank/DPS), Jet (Exotic) and Soldier (Jack of trades).\nAll the classes have strengths and weaknesses. Though Jet gets VERY overpowering in levels 6-8.\n\nThe Story is simple, and the dialogue is purposely cheesy (Cheesy good).\n\nAs stated in other reviews, there is alot of replay-ability with remix campaign that randomizes that enemies spawn where. The levels you get are limited by difficulty. Normal is 1-5, Hard is 5-7, Insane 7-8. With the way gear unlocks the games stays challenging without being overwhelming.\n\nI would recommend this game as a good laugh. The DLC is with it.\n\nThe only negatives I can find is the 3 player limit. (Though with Level 5+ weapons 4+ would make the game a cakewalk).\nAnd that in the wave survival mode you can only play as Soldiers.","January 9, 2014","true","59.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's not a BAD story, but it's not very deep, and it has plot holes and hand-waving galore.\n\nBut that's just part of its charm: it doesn't take itself too seriously. The creators KNOW you bought the game to blow up hundreds of giant bugs - the story was of secondary importance, and just added a little bit of variety to the "Go here, kill everything with more than two legs" factor. That said, the interplay between the Ops and Intel voice actors was amusing.\n\nI feel no shame or hypocrisy in recommending this game when my normal criteria requires an engaging plot. This game is a guilty pleasure, with plenty of replay value thanks to the four types of armors.","December 21, 2012","true","32.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Certainly a different feel from the original which I am sure turned some people off to this particular game. Felt like a decent succsessor although certainly went for a little less old Japanese horror film feel and more of a serious game. My biggest isssue was with scale. The first game had tons of missions and weapons for you to unlock. I am currently going through EDF 2017 again with another friend and we are at approx. 20% after completing over 50 missions, while IA only has 15 missions they do feel a bit longer.

(Up to 6 Players Online)\n\nNew 4 Classes (Like Trooper for example) and leveling up the Classes too.\n\n\n\nI think that's all the new features for this game.\n\nThe Campaing is good. It'll throw you into the level straightt away with no cutscenes. First you are just fighting ants then next thing you are fighting these Tyfoo fighters things.\n\nThe Survival mode is good too. It gets challenging wave after wave.\n\nThe only down bit of the game I can think of is there's no local split screen for the PC version like there is on the Xbox 360 version.\n\nOverall though, the game is good.","June 21, 2015","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Three players coop with a basic leveling system it allows the player to simply jump in equip some weapons and then go all out against humanities ennemies.\n\nFour classes to play from each with their own abilities and weapons(though similarities for the weapons will be obvious for some) three chapters with five missions each give you a good taste of what Earth defence force is about. The varying degrees of difficultie make the game a fresh challenge with its basic in missions objective give you something better to do then "Kill every ennemies on the map" style. We can't forget that the game offers some vehicles between turrets, tank and a walker for your enjoyment.\n\nAll in all great game to play with friends and gives a good introductions to EDF saddly though the later releases aren't on pc which is a bummer.","May 28, 2015","true","44.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you’re familiar with the other games in the series, like 2017 and 2025, be aware this is a different game due to not being developed by Japan.\n\nOverall, the game is nice. While best played with friends, the game does allow for AI teammates that will try their best to revive you when you go down, as well as supplying supporting fire. Dialogue in the game is humorous, in a silly sort of way. Guns are somewhat unique, although on a much smaller scale than other EDF games. (You ever shoot a rocket launcher and find out it splits into a bunch of swirly plasma missiles that crash down and bombard the area?) The feel of each class is enjoyable, and I don’t feel completely useless if my class’s specialty fails (looking at you, 2025). Each class has their own thing they do, and they stand out from each other. Except... maybe Trooper. That's the normal jack-of-all-trades class. No specialty, just "flexibility" to choose from any weapon class to use. Bless your soul if you choose to play Trooper.\n\nCons. Campaign is short. I suppose this is meant to be remedied by the Campaign Remix mode, and three difficulty levels, but I know some people tend to drop games once the campaign is finished. Not to mention that repeating missions can get very boring. As far as I’m aware, absolutely nobody plays Survival mode. Story is weak. It doesn’t even get resolved, even with the alternate ending. It's assumed you're just here to shoot bugs and aliens, and doesn't give you much more. This game is kind of old and not incredibly popular, online multiplayer will probably be a little empty. I can’t say I checked. If you want to keep playing after beating the campaign, maybe you think Inferno difficulty will be a fun challenge, understand you will be in for a real grind. Achievement hunting? Haha. You’re in for a long ride.\n\nIf those things don’t really seem that awful, well, give it a spin. The game was fun enough for me to play it on two systems.","March 6","true","30.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Vehicles are easy to control and powerful, even the turrets, but do not expect them to last very long.\n\nJust beware I have found a 'bug' in the game. In certain missions not all the bugs will come out to hunt you, one or two may get stuck where you cannot reach it or hit it with LOS weapons. (seems a common problem in almost all EDF games i play) It happens mainly when I try to get into the sewer.

Or you can replace the NPC's with online players (a much more helpful prospect, the NPCs are tragically underprepared for air combat). While the game advances or the waves of survival continue the types and abilities in enemies introdces new ways the enemy tries to bring the battle to you. The enemy types range from simplistic, to ludicrous health walls, or in the case of most flying enemies extremely challenging targets unless you are carrying the right weapons.\n\nLuckily the game gives you a massive list of weapons to choose from as you play through and unlock more weapons with interesting differences like specific weapon spreads, tracking, DOT and explosion radius. These all may sound like basic shooter fare, but when coupled with the class abilities for each armor (which each have thier own weapon classes used and level up seperately) makes the experience drastically different for each armor. Wether you fly around with the jetpack, taking carefully aimed sniper shots (or rain death with a rocket launcher) from far above the battlefield, or use the tactical armor to drop turrets to add another gun while blasting with your weapon of choice, or play with the largest weapon selection with the solider or use the heavy to deliver maximum firepower to the enemy.\n\nUnfortunately after beating the main campaign, there story remains totally static, difficulty increases simply give enemies more health, even in the Game + mode the only difference is that enemy types are changed so advanced enemies show up earlier than normal. This makes going back into the story (the only way to advance armor level since survival uses a set level core trooper armor) something of a chore, but with a few friends playing for fun it becomes more enjoyable. Survival is a fun distraction, but without any advancement beyond a number of waves it can become stale once you stop trying out new weapons (especially since you can't unlock new weapons or amor levels in survival) and maps.\n\nAll in All: I really like this game on principal, my first playthrough solo was a huge blast, but I regretably didn't get as much out of subsequent returns to the battlefields of New Detroit. Initial Playthrough: 9/10 (only the prolongued sequences of me trying to shoot down aircraft with a shotgun or gernade launcher prevented the ten). Subsequent Playthrough: 6/10 Man.... it just feels grindy once I change to a new armor... and the NPC playstyle only compounds this issue.\n\nFinal score: 8/10","February 27","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
