So if you played UBERMOSH. You'll be able to beat it in an hour or two. Would be cool if there was an endless mode or a co-op mode or something. Still a good game to pass the time.","February 17","true","0.9"," 19 of 25 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","19","25","2","0"

The only problem with this game is that it's only fun in short bursts. I know that this is the second game, but an update with some extra stuff would be great. I'd recommend buying the UBERMOSH Collection, since it comes with the original UBERMOSH, the soundtrack, and UBERMOSH:BLACK, and it's only six bucks. People need this game in their life, it's a great time waster.","February 26","true","0.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

There is quite a bit of modes making it interesting and fresh to the point where it doesn't feel to repetitive, in other words i see myself having lots of replayability to this game.  A new power is given to the player making you feel mlg in that sense.

The colors looks more polished and the AI also improved. Liked the changes and maybe I didnt get to play the last version with controller, but this one actually supports it and makes the game even more enjoyable. Oh, also mobs are spawning a lot faster, so, it's even more hard core, watch out! 10/10","February 17","true","0.1"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","7","11","0","0"
