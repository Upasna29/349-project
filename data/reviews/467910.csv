Love the music, combat, customization, and the devolopers.\n\nThe music was so awesome. During a fight with the boss the music made me play outta my mind because i thought i was the main character in an anime. :)\n\nThe combat is smooth. The only thing i hate is that magic items or spells can only be used a certain number of times. So building a mage character will be harder especially since the spells also cost mana(I'm fine with mana).\n\nYour weapons can be enchanted to have special effects. Fire, water, wood..etc.\n\nI started a disscusion to ask about adding a camera that centers the character instead, not expecting them to put it in or anything but just ask if they planned on adding it and got an almost immediate answer saying that he would add it in with the patch the next day just for me. I was so surprised and thought he was joking but the next day the patch notes said it was added. So i went in game and there it was. Awesome developers. The game itself is really fun to play and having awesome developers behind it and always improving it for their players is a 10/10 in my book!\n\nOverall: The game is awesome and i would definitely reccomend this game!","May 19","true","11.5"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

Although it's not perfect, this game definitely exceeded my expectations.","May 20","true","68.8"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

The music is great, the writing is good, the gameplay is top-notch (especially for magic), level design is smart, and it has online co-op and online features like messages, with more to come. The game is lengthy with tons of build options and plenty of secrets, there is just simply so much to do, like the Souls games themselves. There are some nice metroidvania elements as well: you unlock power-ups here and there and those let you traverse to areas of the map you couldn't before, and it's implemented very well; finding these power-ups is exciting, just like the Castlevania and Metroid games themselves. Absolutely top-notch game and highly recommend it to anyone, Soulsborne fan or not.\n\nThe game is currently a 9/10 and, with the rate the developer is adding content, will probably only get higher than that. As an avid Souls fan I really want to see this game do well.","May 24","true","32.9"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

It's also a good gateway into the DS series for any one who wanted to try it but were too scared of getting rekt.

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198256797577/recommended/467910/","76561198256797577","Atticus","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198256797577/","26 products in account","First off, I would like to clarify that I am in no way directly affiliated with the developer of this game. The opinions contained herein are my own, and are shared here to attempt to give an accurate and comprehensive picture of my experience with this game. I omit commenting on the plot itself, as I don't feel I have enough information at present to comment accurately on the componant, and won't bother giving input on the multiplayer since I live a ocean away from everyone I've tried to play with. That said:\n\nEPOCH is a 2-D adventure game with a strong influece from the BloodSouls series. The mechanics are inspired by those found in BloodSouls games, in which the player is encouraged to pay close attention to attack animations, enemy traits, and one's environment while reacting appropriately. Much like BloodSouls games, the strict difficulty of the game is just lenient enough to convince the player that difficult obstacles CAN be overcome given the correct strategy. This draw to overcome challenges serves as an excellent hook that leaves one fuming at seemingly 'unfair' enemies and puzzles, only to return to the game minutes later as a potential solution claws at the player's mind. Whether the solution lies in upgrading a weapon, reconfiguring one's equipment, or approaching the obstacle differently; EPOCH continuously offers the player a sense of challenge, with the proper tools to succeed lying in wait. This balance between difficulty and mechanics is exactly what makes the BloodSouls experience so engaging, and it is just as well implemented in EPOCH.\n\nThis drive to overcome obstacles lends itself to EPOCH's unique approach to exploration. The player levels up by acquiring  'Essenses' hidden throughout the game. Each essense gained earns the player 1 experience point, which can be allocated to improving the character's stats, upgrading equipment, or gaining new skills. Some of these are left directly in the player's path, some are neccesary for progressing further into the game, while others are more subtly hidden in nooks and passageways. This encourages players to actively pay attention to the environment, and serves as incentive to revisit previous areas in the hopes of uncovering more experience. Many have alluded to this mechanic as remeniscent of 'Metroidvania'-style exploration, and in a sense this is not inaccurate. However, by giving the player the agency to decide how this experience will be used, one never has the sense that their efforts are wasted on perks which aren't beneficial to one's character. In this sense, exploration in EPOCH very much feels like a hunt to complete a jigsaw puzzle, with the final picture looming ahead of the player as they try to conform the game's mechanics to their own style of gaming.\n\nThe levels themselves are divided into about a dozen areas which are interconnected by small hubs populated with NPCs. The levels themselves are not terribly large, and new avenues open up to the players as they progress through the game which allow for more convenient passage between hub-areas. That said, navigating these mid-ways can be confusing at times as one struggles to recall the path to a particular landmark. The areas themselves are visually unimpressive (with noteworthy exceptions in the form of pixalated statue-art) and contain countless corridors which can be difficult to distinguish from each other in one's mind, save for trace color cues. Further, at the time in which this review is being written, the game features no over-world map which might alleiviate this frustration. While these shortcomings are cetainly forgivable given the nature of the game's engine, it's unfortunate that the environments themselves are rather bland when one of EPOCH's greatest pulls is it's incentive to explore.\n\nYet EPOCH compensates for it's visuals with a well-utilized soundtrack. While the environments may not be visually impressive, each boasts distinitive, memberable tunes from the sombre tones of the game's main theme at The Tower to the sharp, unnerving notes of the spider-infested tunnels of  Bloodrood. The tracks also compliment EPOCH's sprarce, yet compelling, plot as each evokes feelings of anxiety, drama, awe, and tranquility at the appropriate moments. The quality of the soundtrack is one of Epoch's strongest assets, as it manages to engage the player's imagination with EPOCH's melancholy reality.\n\nMaybe I'm wrapping too many words around my experience, and appear overtly partial to the game. In closing, I'm happy to promptly list a number of things I dislike about the game. The dodge rolling mechanics can be unresponsive at times, which sometimes hamper combat; there's a lack of diverse end-game equipment; the inability to respec experience can lead to frustrating handicaps that compromise the player between restarting a character 50 lvls in or bearing one's past judgements; bugs are quite common; &c.\n\nAnd yet, I insist that EPOCH is a worthwhile and unique exeperience. Rather than a 'rip-off' of its insiprations EPOCH is more appropriatly a tribute to these influences. It is one of the few games of its kind that manage to manipulate its constraints while providing enough original content and ingenuity to distinguish itself from the crowd. Despite its constraints, it manages to deliver a genuine, underivative BloodSouls experience tempered with its own individual aethetic and passion. Further, the growing community coupled with the developer's drive to improve the game promise to help the game steadily improve in the future. EPOCH is a must-try for avid dungeons crawlers, lore hounds, and retro 8-bit enuthisiats alike.","May 22","true","39.8"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

If you like dark souls, it's for you, if you like zelda, it's also for you. There's something about 2D games that makes things better, perhaps we're too used to 3D by now that going backwards is entertaining.\n\nNevertheless this game accomplishes things other 2D games aren't even attempting, clever movement, the weapons are drawn with full 360 rotation unlike the common 4 direction frames.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jopperz/recommended/467910/","Jopperz","Jim","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jopperz/","441 products in account","Firstly I wanted to state that this game was created in the Byond engine and all the art work was done in paint I believe (mistake me if I am wrong, Yut) which makes this game all the more impressive that it even exists seeing as the Byond engine is known for being ♥♥♥♥. Though I was a beta tester and I am a friend of the main developer and I have been following his byond Epic series since his first game I will try not to be too biased in this review:\n\nTo begin with you are dumped in a dungeon for the tutorial level which is a straight rip from Dark Souls. Though this tutorial level is arguably one of the best tutorials I have ever seen and the pinnacle of what a tutorial should be I would have preferred something a little more original within this game. How ever unlike Dark Souls you can return to this area later with more skills and knowledge of the game to unlock more secrets with the Essence (Experience points) you have collected. After completing the tutorial level you will then be boated across to the main hub where you will meet some unique characters and get a feel for the story which is rather complex. There are a lot of references to his two previous Epic games hidden through out the wall and a lot of secrets to uncover. As you progress through the story you will see a lot of diverse levels and it suddenly stops being a Dark Souls clone and begins being its own game. My favorite level being the Fire Temple as the main boss offers some humorous lines of dialog along with the puzzle aspect it was an amazing level which was really well designed. There are multiple different weapons and armours in the game each with a unique design and the majority of them hidden away in secret areas. On top of all the weapons there are also some which can only be crafted by visiting an anvil and dragging one weapon onto another. You can find recipes also hidden away which will tell you what combining one weapon with another will create. As to the exact number of armours and weapons that I do not know.\n\nA major gripe I have with some of the secrets is that there is never any indication that there is a secret there but then again I guess it wouldn't be a secret if it wasn't hidden well. Some of the bosses I feel were rather underwhelming and really easy to defeat and would have liked to see them have different attacks to mix things up and make them more challenging. The game was fairly challenging over all how ever I felt that Bows were extremely broken and made the game become extremely easy once I started kiting around enemies and spraying arrows into them without getting touched. Multiplayer worked well once we managed to get it tested how ever it was glitchy when trying to connect to some one as it took a long time to load and there was no indication that it was loading up as you was simply greeted by a black screen and if the server was closed mid way through a game session it would kick you out and say 'Game Session is full' or something a long them lines.\n\nOver all I recommend getting this game just based on the fact it blows my mind this was created using something as ♥♥♥♥♥♥ as the Byond engine (most famous for producing NEStalgia and Space Station 13) along with the attention to detail, the secrets and the puzzle aspects.

It is a more difficult game however. Which is what I was looking for -I beta tested this game- if I didn't I probably would've bought it today! If your not looking for a more difficult game, be careful with this one. It isn't the hardest, but it is unforgiving.

Even though the art isn't amazing, I still bought it because I try not to judge a game on it's art. I started the game and I was instantly put into a deep storyline. The combat reminded me of a fan-game called The Legend Of Zelda: Black Crown. The battle system is really cool, and I can see a lot of Dark Soul-esque themes in the game. So far I'm having a lot of fun with the game.","May 18","true","0.7"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/yourwolfsdengaming/recommended/467910/","yourwolfsdengaming","yourwolfsdengaming","http://steamcommunity.com/id/yourwolfsdengaming/","660 products in account","Product received for free\n\nTitle: EPΘCH\n\nDeveloper: Nick Everlith\n\nPublisher: Nick Everlith / Ryzal Games\n\nReleased For: PC (Windows)\n\nReviewing: PC (Windows)\n\nDRM Versions Available\n\nReleased On: May 18th, 2016\n\nMSRP: $14.99\n\nReview Copy Received By Developer\n\n\n\nWelcome to the world of Epoch, where the game seems destined to fall under the comparison of ‘It’s like Zelda but with Dark Souls stuff’ and we’ll get into that comparison later. You play as a random generic hero with generic goal #1025 of saving a dying world. You create your character from a barebones set of races, hair options, color and charge your way forward through a vast, yet somehow still claustrophobic world. In the game you’ll explore dungeons, caves, the lack of a menu with a quit button (What is it with pixel-style games not having quit buttons on the main menu? First Bit Dungeon II, now this?) and some castles as you wonder to yourself why you chose the worst possible class in the game, all the while still unable to fully grasp why there’s no control support to game that clearly would benefit with it, and why there’s a magic element to the game when magic is clearly the weakest type of combat style.\n\nHave you played Dark Souls, meaning Dark Souls III, not the other ‘From Software’ games? Congrats, you’ve discovered about 90% of the inspiration for the game. At least, that’s what it seems every other review in existence would like to tell you. In actuality, it takes far more inspiration from the recent comeback of rogue and roguelike games. Combat is slow, you’ll often rely on a shield that seems rather determined to never actually block what it’s supposed to block, all the while relying on an axe (at least, that’s what we relied on) that seems to only hit enemies like spiders when it feels like it. You can even leave messages for other players like you can in Dark Souls, and trust us, it’s worth reading some of them if you get stuck. Despite some of these grips with the combat, it was okay enough. We liked the multitude of different types of armor, weapons, gems (things you use to add magical abilities to your weapons/armor), and the ability to level up different perks without any of the perks being locked behind a certain level. You as a player can also only carry so much in terms of armor and weapons, so it’s a good idea to plan ahead why style of fighter you want to be. You’ll fight a fair variety of enemies as well, but none of them have the consistency or cohesive style to them. In example, you’ll fight these giant robot like guardians in the first castle you’ll find. The problem is that the characters are sized up, making them look blurry and rather ‘meh’ as to what they actually were. If we weren’t blatantly told what they were, we’re not sure it would have been clear. Same goes for many of the other enemies. Along the way, players will find ‘essence’. These are the equal to finding lost souls. The premise is that in order to save the world, you need to unlock this huge tower, because all the essence-souls are trapped in the world, and can’t ascend up. This is basically your leveling up system. Every time you find an essence, you get a point to spend either leveling up your gear, or leveling up your character through a selection of perks.\n\nThe game is also by no means a short game. We played for 9 hours before we felt comfortable giving an opinion, and you could easily pool over 30 hours into the game.\n\nWe should also briefly mention it’s the developers first published game. It doesn’t change our review, just thought some may be interested in that fact.\n\nAs you explore the world, you’ll end up dying. Oh yes, you’ll die quite a lot in Epoch. Rather than using hard saves specifically, you find save checkpoints you can use. When you die, you drop your gold and you spawn at the last point you saved at with all your gear. That’s more typical with the continuing in popularity ‘roguelike’ genre of games, but it works fine. Some enemies are too difficult however, and because there’s no way to resource the tips and moves the game gives you unless you just happen to remember literal dozens of text dumps, you’ll often forget many of the things your character can do.\n\nSpeaking of difficulty, the game prides itself on being a learning experience through death, but we’re not sure it’s really “tough but fair” so much as “really cheap deaths, glitches, and things we had no idea where possible” death. For example, we were stuck on a portion of the game for a full hour, just trying to figure out what we were doing wrong, only to find out that we can apparently jump like rabbits over the big, huge crevasses that no one with any imagination could even dream of being the solution. Yes, it’s made clear you can jump and leap, but over 50ft+ black voids that aren’t completely clear are voids to begin with? Again as previously mentioned, the sword and shield sometimes would just arbitrarily not work, even with full stamina and when you drop all of your gold doing this, it gets really tedious doing the same thing twelve times because the game decided to attach you on a wall until your stamina ran out, thereby falling into an abyss you had no right to fall in.\n\nOn a better note, the characters you’ll come across are interesting, and some even got a smirk out of us. Some feel very out-of-place, but they were at least funny. While the story falls onto the side of generic, boring and meh, we still enjoyed going through the world.\n\nVisually, it’s off. Certain sections of the map won’t appear until you’re close enough (presumably to avoid just using the bow and arrow on enemies a thousand miles away), but it really makes the game look janky, which is a pity because some of the visual ideas look nice, and the use of color (take note roguelikes and FromSoftware ) is well done and makes the game look like they actually know more than just different shades of brown. The problem is that the field of vision isn’t active, and is more ‘once you’re in this area, this area is visible’ rather it just being a big circle around the player. It also seems to have some issues with the framerate, and we'll take a guess the frame rate is tied to the movement speed of the character. That's our guess anyway.\n\nAudio wise, it’s nice. The music is well presented, orchestrated, and fits well with the game. Some of the transitions are a bit too drastic, but nothing one couldn’t glance over.\n\nThe game has rebindable keys, but visual and audio settings are sorely lacking.\n\nThe question then comes down to this, do we like Epoch? From a concept perspective, yes. From a critical perspective? Not really. It just feels far too much like a very long roguelike with no real way to die. It was enjoyable enough, but we wonder if “enjoyable enough” and “okay combat” is truly enough to suggest a game asking $14.99 with meh visuals and a combat system that only works when it stops going into the liquor cabinet, after it's already drunk all the expensive wines. It is long and if one can look past the issues, we’d suggest the game more at a discount than at full retail price. If it fixed the issues with the visuals, we’d be much more inclined to be more on the side of a recommendation, so until they improve the visual errors and some of the bugs, just consider it a “buy at a discount” from us.\n\n\n\nPROS\nGreat soundtrack\nFairly diverse level and enemy design\n\nMEH\nCombat is okay\nHaving a way to reference abilities you have would be niec\nSome characters are interesting, but some feel out-of-place\n\nCONS\nReally dumb AI\nThe visual and graphical oddities\nThe minor glitches and bugs present\n\nIf you'd prefer to read the review on our website (it's the same thing, but with pictures) click here: http://yourwolfsdengaming.com/2016/05/23/epoch-review-yourwolfsdengaming/","May 23","true","14.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"
