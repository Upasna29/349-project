"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrnasalcongestionman/recommended/241720/","mrnasalcongestionman","Mr Nasal Congestion Man","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrnasalcongestionman/","328 products in account","Steam may say I only have a few hours, but I've played it for hundreds of hours back when it was on Desura.\n\nThis game had potential, but turned out awful due to poor execution.\n\n\nLet me start off with the gamemodes. Some game modes are good, some are bad, some are okay. There are 8 gamemodes: Team Deathmatch, Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, Lava Survival, Meteor Survival, Siege, Spleef, Onslaught and Paranoia .\n\n-The Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, and Capture the Flag gamemodes are all exactly what they sound like and follow the typical model.\n\n-In Lava Survival, lava is rising from the bottom from the map. If you touch it you die. The last man alive wins. When players shoot each other, they don't die, but instead they are frozen for a short duration of time.\n\n-Meteor Survival is about the same as Lava Survival, except you are surviving from lava meteors falling from the sky.\n\n-In siege mode, two teams must build an outlined structure while preventing the enemy team from finishing theirs by destroying it. What usually results is that instead of working to help complete the structure, the prepubescent children which your team consists of will all just be running around and killing enemies. Alternatively, they will rocket-spam the enemy structure. Since the rate of destruction greatly outmatches the rate on construction, the match usually goes nowhere and it ends in a draw when the timer runs out or everybody leaves the match. This is by far the worst game mode of all.\n\n-In spleef, you shoot and destroy the blocks beneath other players so that they fall to the lava at the bottom of the map and die. There isn't any skill requirement, people just run around in circles. It's pretty much a copy off of minecraft spleef. This is also a particularly awful game mode.\n\n-In onslaught, you and three other players defend against wave after wave of AI monsters. This includes mainly kamikaze spiders, enemy soldiers, giant underground worms, and occasionally something else. The game ends when your entire team dies.\n\n-In paranoia, one player starts as the zombie queen. The zombie queen runs around and tries to infect survivors by meleeing them or using on her abilities. After this, they become zombies and try to infect other survivors. The survivors of course run away or shoot the zombie threats. The game ends when all the survivors become zombies, or the zombie queen and all of the zombies are dead. However, there is minimal distinction between zombies and survivors. You'll instinctively see anyone you see, and if that's a survivor, he will become a zombie and your guns will be revoked for 15 seconds.You'll likely lose. This another poorly designed game mode.\n\n\nOnto the gameplay and mechanics. They're horrible. I have never, ever, in my entire life played an fps as flawed as this one. I don't even know where to begin. Here's a list of all the problems;\n\n-Match Size. It's capped at 16 players.\n\n-Netcode. It's really bad. I can be playing on an official server, and everyone in the server will have a perfect connection with low ping, but yet the game still has lag problems. I've had times where I would shoot and kill someone, only for the game to say they died 3 seconds later. This means that it would have to waste an extra 3 seconds as well as the rest of my clip to finish an enemy. That bit of time lost on killing the enemy plus the time needed to reload can be the difference between life or death.\n\n-Snipers. They have high projectile speed, are super accurate, and have almost no bullet drop. Combine this with the fact that the characters heads are so large and you get a guranteed  headshot.\n\n-Mines. You have the option of carrying deployable mines with you. Not only are they insta-kills and have a large blast radius, people spam them near the spawns of the enemy team. Sometimes, getting out your spawn section on some maps without being sniped or blown up by a mine is a challenge all in itself.\n\n-Weapon Balance. The weapons used to be way to powerful. it used to be that if you happened to do as little as enter an enemy's crosshair and you were dead. I once made my own SMG. It had 100 ammo per magazine, shot 25 shots per second, and dealt 20 damage per shot. Unless you have a special perk, you have 100 health. That meant that it would take a mere .2 seconds to kill an enemy. The aim-down sight accuracy of it was rated "40"(500 is lowest accuracy, 2 is highest).\n\nI once used it  on a map called "Bridge". The teams spawn far enough away from each other as to the point where the are extremely tiny. When I spawned, I saw a few enemies. I unleashed my SMG. Within less than three seconds, I had completely wiped out the enemy team of eight. True story.\n\nLater on, however, they severely nerfed all weapons (especially customs) as to the point where they are extremely weak. Using the default assault rifle at close-medium range, it now takes over 2 seconds to kill the enemy if you hit every shot. As a result, the gameplay has evolved to the point where people just sprint  around (you can sprint super fast, and even faster with the scout perk) the map (or fly using the grappling shot) and instakill you by meleeing you with the sword.\n\n-Vehicles. There is a machine-gun hoverbike, helicopter and tank vehicle in this game. They are extremely strong and get plenty of kills with. They also have very quick respawn times. Consequentially, in maps with vehicles the gameplay begins to complete revolve around them, rather than any infantry gameplay. Also, vehicles are treated like infantry as far as collisions go. They have no armor. Just a large amount of health. Do you remember my SMG I mentioned earlier? It could take down a tank in a matter of seconds. Thus, the vehicles tend to be killing powerhouses which are also destroyed extremely easily.\n\n-Recoil. None of the weapons have recoil. When you're crafting a weapon, there's an option to add recoil if you want, but it's really unnatural and synthetic and who wants to add recoil when its easier without it? As a result, the shooting in this game requires zero, and I mean absolutely zero skill.\n\nThe crafting system can be fun, but it isn't very useful/helpful.\n\n-Gunsmithing: You can create a gun with its own design and stats, but after the huge nerf they had, the custom guns almost always pale in comparison to the default ones. Also, the entire process of making a quality gun (one that looks like an actual gun, not just 7 random blocks you spammed together) takes several hours. In addition to that, all guns require an ironsights image (what you see on your gun when you aim down the sights). This will require you to use 3rd-party software to design those images. So ultimately, gunsmithing isn't really worth it unless you want bash people with your giant custom ♥♥♥♥♥ (I'll admit this is the one part of Guncraft which I think is kind of fun).\n\n-Prefab Making: Prefabs are pre-made structures which you can put down. In the editor, you can design them. The problem is that to place one in a match, you need money to do so. A good prefab can be really expensive. Also, when you choose to build, you must wait for it to build. It will construct itself at a couple blocks every few seconds. It is a super slow process and isn't viable for the high-speed gameplay of guncraft.\n\n-Map making. The game comes with a map editor. With a ton of time and effort, you can actually make something decent.\n\n\nAbout the community:\n\nThe community of guncraft is long dead.There once was a time where you could always log on and find about 30 players online (Even if most were immature children). Now, on a lucky occasion you can log on and find 4 friends or so playing together, but that's about it. If after I've said you still ended up getting this game, then you'll be stuck all alone. Playing with yourself.\n\n\nTL,DR: Mediocre gamemodes,  poorly done shooting mechanics and gameplay, mostly useless crafting system, and dead community.\n\nDon't get this game.","February 22, 2014","false","16.1"," 311 of 377 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","311","377","0","34"

Concept is cool, Make a gun or a map, use your creativity, and then use them to play the game.\n2. Workshop is full of awesome weapons and maps, and every(yes, every single one) gun is compatible with every map.\n3. It has some cool gamemodes.\n4. You have awesome vehicles, and you can build or destroy parts of the map, even add a giant building to it.\n5. Read the other reviews for some more pros.\n\nCons\n1. Game is pretty much dead, There's barely any players playing the game and that's really where the game balances on. So it's best to just start a lan party if you'd want to play this game.\n2. It gets a bit boring after a while of playing, so it's hard to really play for a long amount of time.\n3. It's hard to understand the game when first playing, and really isn't a game for people that just started with the fps genre.\n\nIf there were more people to play the game, i'd rate it a 8.3/10.\nSo i recommend to play the game only if you have a lot of friends nearby, or when people actually start playing the game.\n","May 26, 2015","false","5.5"," 85 of 95 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","85","95","3","7"

Here's why I can't recommend it right now\nNo players, you don't get a chance to play many of the different play styles becuase you can only usually find 1 mostly full Team Deathmatch server and a few other servers sprinkled with 2-3 players.\nThe game could also use a few min building stage when each map starts.. This would diferentiate it between Ace of Spaces, Build n Shoot, and whatever other Blocky shooting games there are out there.\n\nWhat I liked:\nVaried game styles (see above)\nAbility to customize content (Althoguh the approval method seems random)\nBuilding mechanic: You can set up prefab bunkers or bridges pretty easily.\nFun vehicles.. A bit more warning on being shot would be nice but still fun to blow thorugh blocks with tank or chopper\nVaried guns. Want to blow up blocks then snipe thorugh the hole.. sure.. want to carry an assualt rifle grenades and a hacksaw sure.\n\nEdit: After the fall sale this game is still pretty much a wasteland.  If you like Deathmatch or Team Deathmatch then you may find this game pretty fun.  I picked it up for the other game modes and am unfulfilled. I log in every once in awhile see that no one's playing the alternate modes and log off.. Maybe I'm part of the problem, but I don't feel like sitting on an empty server waiting for someone to join up.","November 25, 2013","false","20.9"," 219 of 304 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","219","304","0","4"

Other than those three things, they are very different. Minecraft is a open world sandbox game. Guncraft is a multiplayer shooter.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMany people say that Guncraft is just some cheap knockoff of AoS, but such statements are untrue. Guncraft and Ace of Spades are quite different from one another.\n\nYou may be saying. "You have no idea what you're talking about. They're exactly the same. They both have blocks, and they both have guns. What makes them different from each other?"\n\nThe following will answer that question.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nGuncraft gives you the ability to make and use your own custom classes, custom guns, custom melee weapons and tools, custom maps, custom prefabs, and custom character skins.\n\nIt has hookshots that let's you make a quick getaway, get to that perfect sniping perch, or just get somewhere fast.\n\nIt has parachutes that let you rain down bullets while floating up high, or just slow down a fall so you don't hit the ground with a lifeless thud.\n\nIt has vehicles you can use such as helicopters and hoverbikes.\n\nIt has unique gamemodes such as Meteor Survival, Racing, and Paranoia.\n\nIt has awesome devs that listen and respond to the community and constantly improve the game.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nOther than custom maps, Ace of Spades has none of the things listed above.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThere are no mods or combination of mods for Minecraft that can give you what Guncraft has to offer.\n\nSeriously.\n\nCan anybody show me a Minecraft mod, or combination of Minecraft mods, that lets you build your own custom gun, put your own custom ironsight on that gun, give it custom stats (player/vehicle damage, accuracy, clip size, rate of fire, etc...), then use it to blow up a helicopter piloted by the enemy, see him plummet to the ground in the form of a funky-looking snowman, then watch as a deadly rain of meteors obliterates him?\n\nI didn't think so.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGuncraft's customization is what really makes it stand out from other shooters. Did you ever want to make that super cool high-tech ninja class equipped with dual laser guns, a hookshot, an epic katana, and proximity mines? Guncraft gives you the ability to do that.  :)\n\nThe only negative thing about Guncraft that I can think of is the lack of players, but in time, I'm sure more people will start playing.\n\nGuncraft is an enjoyable, customizable, and unique shooter that lets you be creative. It's not well known, popular, or very populated, but it's still a great game worth checking out!\n\nBlock&Load! :D","November 25, 2013","true","462.2"," 166 of 250 people (66%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","66","166","250","0","8"

It has auto-build features in-game for what are called prefabs, this way you can be building, and defending at the same time which is very useful. The maps vary in sizes from small arenas too very large castle ridden hills with tunnels all over the place. Every map plays very differently from the last.\n\n\nIt is true, the game has a small (really small) player base, sometimes to the point where 4 people are playing in visible servers and that's it. However, this is why you should buy this game and spread the word about it. It has everything to be a very well populated game, it just doesn't have the advertising strength.\n\n\nSome people may argue the game isn't balanced because Sniper Rifles are OP, however, they only kill in one shot with a head shot (if the rifle is max power which results in one shot per clip) and characters move at about 1% of their normal speed when reloading a sniper rifle balancing out the power well, because they become a sitting duck when reloading. Each weapon type has a certain level of skill needed to be used effectively, and each gun certainly does work differently from the next, so everyone will have a gun they can excel with.\n\n\nVehicle play in this game makes it very unique when compared to games such as Ace of Spades, I mean, who wouldn't want to fly a helicopter over a football stadium and blow a hole through a wall for your team mates to rush the enemy flag through?\n\n\nPros:\n- Unique Maps and reflect varying Gameplay\n- Vehicles\n- custom guns you can make or download\n- Good Balance, even with custom guns\n- Kill Streak Perks\n- Construction block by block, or automated pre-fabs\n\nCons:\n- Small player base\n- Poor advertisement resulting in a very very slowly growing player base\n- Some maps can be too large for idealistic game play\n- The active servers often have a high ping (90-130), but they are still playable.","December 25, 2013","true","13.4"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

When i first started sure it had its rough spots, but it fun and very competitive. Now its one of my most favorite games. Still working through a few kinks here and there but every game has them. Those who put it down because of minecraft need to think again. Minecraft was inspired from Infiniminer, and Guncraft from minecraft. You also must understand its a very different game. Instead of mining you blow peoples heads off on custom made maps, with custom made guns for a limited amount of time. Your on a battlefield like Halo, CoD, StarWars Battlefront, 007 Golden eye. The population maybe a little low right now but i see it growing in the future. I want to thank you if you read this and i shall see you on the blocky battlefield. ;)\n\ni love how most of the reviews are within 5 minutes of playing the game... at least give it the weekend, i mean sure you dont know the controls (which are in the settings), you get your ♥♥♥ kicked (you just got the game what did you expect), its laggy (well then dont play on the player servers). These are simple problems and every game has them. If you have a problem, instead getting mad just simply post it on the website and the staff will be at your service.

The community is small but friendly and helpful and the staff tends to listen to their clients (Us!). Weapons aren't so much 'Overpowered' as it is a case of there being a plethroa of playstyles/weapon loudouts and classes which offer an all but endless mix of play options and it can take people awhile to find a set of each that works for them. The editors take a bit of learning to use but are extremely quick and easy to use once you get used to the options and shortcuts and one can often find themselves wasting countless hours in the map editor or gun smithery getting their tools of destruction jusst right. Overall I'd give this a 7/10, Like I said it has some growing to do but the company's learning as they go and I for one support them. :D","October 9, 2014","true","506.7"," 22 of 34 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","22","34","2","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jack_Spade/recommended/241720/","Jack_Spade","Jack_Spade","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jack_Spade/","66 products in account","Guncraft is a voxel-based shooter, but it's not just Minecraft with guns.\n\nThe standard FPS Deathmatch/Team Deathmatch is reminiscent of the Call of Duty franchise, albeit with a much more light-hearted and playful vibe. Combat is fast-paced and unpredictable, as players are free to destroy and rebuild the environment on the fly. The mining mechanic has been simplified from Minecraft because it's no longer the focus of the game. Mined blocks are traded for Resources, which are measured in dollars and correlate with the mined block's durability; resources can also be earned by scoring kills or achieving objectives. Resources can then be traded for new blocks, Killstreaks (a la COD), or prefabricated structures, which cost as much as their constituent blocks but spawn much more quickly.\n\nIn addition to maps and prefabs, players can also craft their own weapons. Players build their weapons using the same controls as in map and prefab editing, then select an archetype (assault rifle, shotgun, etc.) and assign points to different categories (hipfire accuracy, shoulder accuracy, damage, etc.). Players can make anything they want as long as it's not obscene or trademarked, and share it with the community on Steam Workshop.\n\nGuncraft gives players plenty of opportunity to enjoy their new maps, prefabs and weapons. In addition to the stadard DM/TDM, Guncraft also offers plenty of unique game modes:\n-In Spleef, players have only a drill and are trying to dig the floor out from under other players so they fall into the lava.\n-In Paranoia, one or two players are randomly selected as zombie queens, who try to infect normal players and turn them into zombies. Normal players can't chat and don't know who's a queen, ratcheting up the tension.\n-In Lava survival, players try to push each other into rising lava. The similar Meteor survival mode has them trying to survive a meteor barrage. In both modes, players only die from contact with the environmental hazard; weapons only freeze the target for 12 seconds.\n-Race is just what it sounds like.\n-Onslaught pits a team of up to four players against ever-increasing hordes of enemy bots. Very difficult, and very exciting.\n\nOverall, the game balance is surprisingly good. It definitely feels like an Indie game, but not in a bad way. The developers are very responsive to community feedback and concerns, and the game is always improving. The community is small at the moment, but loyal. We could always use you if you want to join.","March 1, 2014","true","380.5"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","13","19","0","6"

I really, really, really want to like this game.\n\nBut.. I can't.\n\nIt's got varied and unique game types. This game has not only the standard CTF and Team Deathmatch modes, it also offers a Horde mode, a RACING mode, and a "Lava Survival" mode where you scurry and climb to the very top of a map while keeping your opponents from doing the same, whether that is by shooting the ground out from under them, or shooting them and temporarily turning them into snowmen.\n\nYou can create your own maps, weapons, or skins with the built in editor. You can make maps in Minecraft and import them! You can do literally anything with this game. You can even place helicopters in random parts of your map!\n\nHowever... you won't WANT to do anything with this game. The shooting is very clunky, it's serviceable but not something you'll crave and want to come back to. When you die, you get shuffled to a killscreen with no notification. You are often killed instantly with ZERO feedback on what or who killed you 99% of the time. You hear no gunshot or explosion and just instantly get kicked to the kill cam to watch your opponent and see where he was for two seconds. Then you spawn and hope that doesn't happen again.\n\nThe driving mechanics are also very poorly done, and take quite some time to get the hang of- and even then, they're not something you want to use often.\n\nFor all the hate Ace of Spades gets, at least it makes shooting fun. This game falls flat on the very basics and doesn't do anything very well, outside of letting you make some great maps. Then again, Minecraft serves that purpose much better.\n\nI'm not going to recommend anyone buy this. Watch some gameplay on YouTube, get a feel for how bad the game was crafted [lol.] At the same time, I'm always going to come back and try to give it another chance. I love the idea and even though I know it's not going to improve, I still have some dumb blind hope that I'll actually have fun with this someday.","October 1, 2013","false","10.9"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","12","19","0","0"

Variety of guns to choose on default! Creators are not greedy and want players to join and so do the people. Ace of spades has shaders and no dynamic lighting. Guncraft has Dynamic lighting and the full optization of freedom you will enjoy! Believe me, I am a true support.

You can make your own guns with your own unique, balanced (Keyword, BALANCED) weapons, and your own skins for your player. The editor is basic enough for new guys to make weapons, while the Minecraftian artists will still have plenty of fun making detailed, fine crafted ones.\n\nWhile the killstreak list is tiny, aiming can be difficult, and the controls can be frustrating, gameplay is still okay.\nIt plays like a normal shooter, with grenades, two guns, and a melee. The keyboard controls are spread out everywhere, so finding what button does what can be a challenge.\n\nOne of the funnest game modes to play is the lava survival, provided you can avoid everyone else. Most of the time, however, you'll find yourself inside a pit with a half naked man standing above you lobbying grenades down to make sure you stay there. All in all, it's really good for customizing, but not worth 15 bucks juuuust yet.

But nothing can compare to the awesome experiance I get when I play Guncraft. The latest updates added some really nice shading, to make the game look more professional, and now this small indie company is coming to Xbox. For $15, I would buy this game, I already did, and I can say that it was most certainly worth the money, I've been playing for 3 years, so I can tell you this review is accurate.\n\nOnce you enter a game, you may have some challanges to overcome (Deadsin, Redcorpion, and a few other players come to mind). I highly reccommend taking the tutorials, first thing. It will prepare you for whats ahead, there are a variety of clans you can join if you like, Clan of Bacon [Bcon] is the best one, you should join that.\n\nThe game has aspects to it that no other Voxel shooter has (AoS, Blockstorm etc.) The Hookshot! It's a grappling hook that if used correctly can amount to you flying over the whole map raining bullets on your enemies below.\n\nDo I recommend the game? YES, Do I think it's worth the money? YES, Do I think you should ignore all the people who don't recommend this game? YES.\n\nOne small issue though.... There are not a ton of players, but if you hang around the game, you can find people online.","September 25, 2014","true","515.1"," 20 of 36 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","20","36","2","1"

Guncraft is your typical FPS taking on the gameplay of CoD/Battlefield rather than TF2, then adding elements of Minecraft. It's very easy to learn to play yet takes lots of practice to master. Also, the customization options are great, and you'll spend a lot of your time customizing the game until you have the exact loadout you want, whether you're a flying sniper or a stationed demolitons man. Only problems I have are a few bugs such as the ones others mention with joining servers, and how overpowered most vehicles are.

Yes, it's called Guncraft, which emphasizes the guns and shooting part, but this game was promoted as being open to building things as well and the choices are not that much. In build mode you get a simple list of blocks you are able to insert into the map, and if you are crafty enough you can build your own structures with the blocks. But for all the promoting and advertising done on this game it's obvious playing it long enough that it is mainly an fps shooter game and secondarily a block building game.\n\nThe multiplayer aspect though can be fun, with a wide range of weapons classes to use, as well as the option for anybody to build a custom gun and submit it for later use. Killstreaks add benefits to the game if you do well enough in a match to get them. The default map list is large, with various types of maps to choose from that are quite creative. Overall, this game is a fine fps multiplayer game but it does not do so well on the building part.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/InsanitySubject/recommended/241720/","InsanitySubject","FantasyRow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/InsanitySubject/","7 products in account","Do I really need to explain this?\n\nOk, so when I saw the trailer, and the IGN review, I was like "Oh my gosh, this looks fun!" When I got it, my first day playing it went well suprisingly, and I looked forward to playing the next day. Then I looked at the servers, and they were unpopulated. So I played some AOS, my only other game. For the next few day the servers were still unpopulated. This went on for several months, so I bascically stopped playing. When you actually start playing, it's a whole other story.\n\nThe graphics SUCK and that is an understatement. You cant even tell what the heck what's going on half the time, but that isn't usually a bad thing, since there is no playablility.\n\nIf you're going to ignore the graphics and the many bugs, then this game still sucks. That whole "approval" trash that guncraft does to approve something is rubbish. I've seen and felt first hand the power and the over-poweredness (is that a word?) of the fact that a one hit kill minigun with 100 rounds with 10 bullets per second is approved? What the heck?!\n\nSpeaking of making guns, that system is the only decent theing in the game. However, that still kinda sucks, because in the trailer it never says that you have to make an ironsight. This is what commonly happens; you make an awesome and detailed gun, only to realize you know nothing about computers, and you have to make an upload an iron sight, with some unknown program. That right there is the definition of a rage.\n\nOk, now to the killstreaks. they're kinda cool, but not really. the best in my opinion is the hover bike, which is the only thing people will ever use. How the heck would you even get the kills for the big things like the mega suit. It is so laggy you might commit suicide and not even know it!\n\nThe equipment. By that I mean, the grenades. They SUCK, and that is being kind and considerate. They do NO damage at all! Gunk grenade is like the blooper from mario kart but much less annoying. The regular grenade I threw the last century and still won't explode. The others, I'm not even going to talk about, they make want to puke.\n\nOne last thing. Isn't there a law in the constitution or something, that you can't advertise that another game sucks? The first guncraft trailers were just that, back stabbing AOS (which is VERY fun by the way) saying how it is better. But really, it is just the opposite. Sure there are helis, tanks, grapples, and parashutes (correct my spelling is i'm wrong) but those suck. Even the helicopter, which I was excited for, you can't even fly correctly. It doesn't give you a turtorial, ao you end up going staight up until you explode for some reason.\n\nVerdict;\nDONT get this game for your life, you're mom's life, or even your girlfriend's and/or boyfriend's, because it'll just make it worse. If you're going to buy a game that includes building and placing, get AOS. That is fun, and isn't buggy, runs smooth, and the graphics are exceptional. This thing is a discrase to the gaming world, and shouldn't be on steam. Dont get this, please, it will make you're hard earned 13 bucks go to some lazy developer that couldn't make a game correctly.\n\nDisclaimer;\nMy graphics card isn't the best, but is I can play AOS smoothly, then there is no reason for this game to lag so freaking hard.\n\nTo the Devs;\nHonestly, your game sucks, there is no other way to put it. Pro tip, adding texture packs won't change the game, it make you look lazy. I mean seriously, a game with this bad graphics can't take so long to update with a benificial update. If you update this, i may have a different opinion, but as it is, that wont happen in the next millenia","June 3, 2014","false","25.4"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","2"

That statement may have you confused because of the game's obvious similarities to Minecraft. Some people may not be able to turn from that mindset, but I will tell you that this is not a Minecraft clone with some first-person shooter sprinkled on top; it's a unique first-person shooter with Minecraft-like elements embedded into it. The game certainly has its flaws, but these are mostly outweighed by the unparalleled involvement in the community and readiness to improve the game displayed by the developers.\nGuncraft does not simply encourage creativity. It provides the best possible tools and environment for endless customization, and that doesn't apply only to aesthetics. Everything about the game—weapon appearance, weapon performance, maps, player appearance, playstyle—is extremely customizable. For example, if you're about to play on a large map full of vehicles, you could choose your class with a sniper rifle and anti-vehicle gun. Since this class wouldn't enable you to be very mobile (you wouldn't have a space left for a hookshot, which allows you to quickly travel places), you would have a jetpack as one of your multi-kill rewards in order to traverse vertical obstacles quickly.\nIf you don't feel like making something of your own—which I highly recommend—you can always go pick up some amazing stuff off the workshop. If you do want to create something yourself, you will find that it's quite easy. If you want to dual-wield a gold-plated chainsaw with a grenade launcher attachment, go for it. When you're building, instead of having a 1x1x1 area that you can place a block in for days until you finish your project, you can adjust your brush size on every axis by pressing keys; you can even use offset, which will move the brush along any axis away from the block your reticle has selected. Any color on the RGB scale can be used in gunsmithing. Shading really improves the quality of a weapon, even if it isn't very detailed.\nI highly recommend this game. The things that I assume turn people away are the name, the similarities to Minecraft, the fact that it's Greenlit, and other smaller things such as the terrible "block and load" pun and its childish appearance. At least give this game a try if you have an extra fifteen dollars or want to experience something new. I've made use of every cent, and gotten much more than I paid for.","February 14, 2014","true","058.7"," 20 of 37 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","20","37","0","1"

Let's get the less convincing things out of the way first and spare you the loss of build up:\n\n- The movement is a little floaty and not like any other FPS I've played. When you slide off a surface, you act like Bubsy the Bobcat and just continue to glide and slip all over the place when you just want to land. Be careful with themz ledges and edges.\n\n- Also there is no stairblocks added so far but you can sprint up the blocks, although that gets tedious really fast. Jumping across them is no faster.\n\n- The concept of throwing out Bouncing Betties are a good feature from more popular FPS series that they tried in this game. But the reason why it worked in those games and not this one is that there was a limit to one per person. Now, what happens when Guncraft allows players to throw out five Bouncies', die, respawn and repeat?\nYou get a mine field. And that's NOT fun nor strategic.\n\n\nWith the bad side aside, let's move to what Guncraft did right:\n\n+ If you like those FPSs that I just mentioned then you are in for a treat because Guncraft uses some of those better elements in its own favor such as Perks, Killstreaks and Vehicles.\n\n+ While you are equiped with Guncrafts Hookshot, you can fly and parachute all over the map if you have a tall building to cling on to. It's really satisfying!\n\n+ An obstacle in your way? Pull out your Sword/Hammer/Pickaxe/Drill and get to work and show that hinder whos the baws! That's right, you can dig and place blocks in battle using build mode to get through a wall or build a barricade to gain that tactical advantage.\n\n+ Now to the big one: The idea that the game depends at like 70 percent of your creativity! That's right, you can craft anything like, your own guns, skins, prebuilts that you can just plop in in the midst of battle and to build your own maps and levels and use help from the built in filters and generators incase you want the right terrain like mountain, field, taiga, etc. When you're finished you can also add your new made work to your Workshop Page and let your friends have a look even though they don't own the game.\n\nIn conclusion, the game does have bad stuff but it quickly makes up for it with its gameplay that's dependant on the player and his commitment.\n\nI give the game an 8 out of 10.

In my expierience, I found a decent amount of players, enough to get a match going. But that's not the reason why I'm not recommending this game. I don't recommend it because this is a boring, non-satisfying multiplayer shooter. The graphics, the audio, the animations, and the UI are very dull and don't give me an adrenaline rush like other shooters. Add that to the fact that I absolutly suck at the game and I just can't get any sort of satisfaction from this. I also lack the third party software to make guns, which was the main reason I bought the game in the first place. If your interested in a voxel based shooter, I reccommend Block N Load, Ace of Spades, or Blockstorm. They are a lot more polished, and exciting.\n\nBut to the game's credit, it has some of the coolest gamemodes ever! The rising lava one is ingenious for a voxel game like this.

You can create, customize, and balance your own guns, class, maps, and even your own character.  Creation not your cup of tea?  There's a moderate amount of default and community-created items already at your disposal, so you can just jump right into the action from the start! Although this game is not without flaws (Sniper-Oriented classes tend to be far too over-powered, which also seems to be the cause of a small player-base), Guncraft is a game with huge potential, an interesting selection of game modes, and a nice balance between action- and leisure- gameplay.","November 7, 2013","true","24.3"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","11","20","0","0"

It combines many features from minecraft like the building. It also has a wide variety of gametypes to play. Onslaught is an amazing gameype you can play with up to four players like call of duty zombies. Its just the zombies are robots and some have guns and some explode like creepers. They also have all the normal gametypes like capture the flag and deathmatch. But my personal favorite is paranoid. Paranoid is like infection from Call of Duty or Halo. It starts out with two zombies and they have to try to infect all the other humans.\nGuncraft also has a wide variety of customization options. You can build your maps, guns, and even make your own skin like in minecraft but with a lot more pixels. It also has Steam Workshop support so right of the bat you can start some awesome guns, skins, and maps made by the community. There are a few problems though. The helicopter controlls are a bit confusing and the graphics are lacking some detail. Some of the physics just dont seem right. The hookshot is way too overpowerd. You can almost get from one end to another end of a map. But overall I would give this game a 9.5/10. Its a great game. It just wouldnt be the same without the Workshop. Even though there are some minor issues the game is pretty dang good. So I reccommend you get this game.","June 24, 2014","true","6.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It allows you to create any gun that pops up in your head. Weather it is a space lazer gun, or a wild west revolver, you can make it. Honestly, this has been one of the most creative games I have ever played, and probably will stay that way for a long time. It is very exciting when you finish your guns, and most the work will pay off in the end. If you get guns approved, you can use them in game. Not only that, but it allows other users to use your creations, if its a skin, gun, melee weapon, or vehicle and gets approved, anyone can use it. This game deserves a 10/10 in my opinion.","June 23, 2014","true","4.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BenMcGinn/recommended/241720/","BenMcGinn","DeadPolygon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BenMcGinn/","60 products in account","This game is made on a beautiful idea that really works on paper, the idea of FPS meets Indie Cube World. But it just doesn't deserve the money they charge for it due to its community. This is an all multiplayer game with such a lack of occupied servers that you wont EVER find yourself engaged by the game types. Most servers are barron and in addition most occupied, good ping servers are private.\n\nThe gameplay is mostly as expected but nothing special, it has movement issues in its jump arcs and having to jump over every block rather than seemlessly running over them. (which can be done while sprinting, but with an odd dely that isn't made from a bad ping or lag). As well as a TERRIBLE physics engine which will always make in game gravity just feel odd. Oh and there are no water physics, at all.\nThis game takes good ideas like block level design modes and even gun creation modes and screws them up. It has a terrible UI that is clearly trying to be like a development kit (and failing) rather than being a user friendly, creative game type. It has loadout and character customization but no leveling or progression system, which ultimately defeats the point of customizing and therefore makings the core gameplay feel half ♥♥♥♥♥. It feels like i am playing a beta test when there is a heavy focus on customization, but no progression and therefore no rewards to be had from killing enemies.\n\nThis game is good but ultimately a huge disappointment from what i had expected and really doesn't execute this fantastic idea for a game very well. It needs a SERIOUS price drop for now, just to bulk up the community a little more. This being its most pressing problem on the top of an entire stack of issues. Its just not worth £11.99. Unless it undergoes a price reduction, i cannot recommend this game.","January 8, 2014","false","4.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Thats what I and most likely a lot of people do with GunCraft, and Im here to say dont do that. Originally I thought this would be a shameless ripoff of minecraft, and boy I was wrong. In fact crafting has little to do with this, and only comes into play when placing blocks. Thats about it. The game is really just a mix of Call of Duty, battlefield, and minecraft.\n\nIt gets its CoD gameplay from the shooting, which is surprising good feeling. You start off with your normal array of weapons, like sub machine guns and snipers, but going to the steam workshop you can get crazy guns, and extra skins, that fit your play style in multiplayer. Dual weilding miniguns, ftw.\n\nThe battlefield likeness comes from the 100 percent destructible enviorments and the vehicles. There are hover bikes, tanks, and helicopters. Each is balanced and controlled well And are fun to use.\n\nThe minecraft part comes from the look of the game. You can also break and place certain blocks with in game money you get from kills. You can do an array with the blocks, such as building a small sniping bunker, to a sheild wall. Where the block placing is mostly used however is in the expansive map making. The game allows you to create some unique mulitplayer maps.\n\nThere are also many gadgets you can use, such as grappling hooks and swords. And I cant begin to describe how good it feels to jump off a building and parachute down, while blowing your enemies heads clean off.\n\nThe only thing I can think that the game could benefit from would be kill streaks and leveling up. Technically there are kill streaks, however they arnet very rewarding, giving you only slight advantages. Overall the game is a fun package, one i can recommend to anyone. 8/10","June 2, 2014","true","12.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I hoped this was going to be Ace of Spades done properly, but I'm surprised to say it's even worse.\n\nMovement and controls are clunky, so don't expect to be running and jumping and shooting skilfully. This (and the target audience) is probably why most matches are just sniper wars.\n\nPlenty of things don't have sounds, which is actually a big deal because it makes things feel unresponsive. Even taking/capturing/returning the flag doesn't have sounds, only a small message. This makes it very difficult to tell what's happening.\n\nEven with those things fixed, the gameplay just isn't balanced. As expected, the sniper dominates. CTF is poorly done - nobody really wants to take the flag because of snipers, and because you have to walk the flag back on foot, unable to use any weapons. The flag returns quickly enough that you often can't get back to it in time after dying, and sadly most of the team don't try to help.\n\nThere is a building system too, but it's redundant. Nobody has time to build things because the controls are too cumbersome and will get them killed. Anything other than stairs and bridges are useless anyway.\n\nIn short, this is a game that had potential but plays like an alpha, which is unforgiveable given the amount of time it's been on Steam.","May 28, 2014","false","5.2"," 10 of 19 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","10","19","0","4"

It seems to be a modern Ace of Spades with vehicles, which if you were to strip most of the content from Ace of Spades out it would be, but it fails. Horribly optimised, poor building/breaking system, mainly empty, high pinged servers and glitchy multiplayer movement makes for a poor playing experience. Gunplay is ok, vehicles are pretty awesome but can be glitchy at times. The game constantly crashes while trying to load maps, making it really difficult to actually play.\n\nIf you find a server with some people, it's alright though","December 30, 2013","false","105.6"," 11 of 21 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","11","21","0","0"

Being able to dig trenches, a small wall, or even a fancy bunker made for an interesting game where the key to winning isn't just shooting people, but being able to build things to keep people from killing you as easily, be it as simple or complex as you desire.\n\nThis is not the case here.... All this game turned out to be is a simple run and gun game that provides silly killstreaks ala CoD.. Hell, it is nothing more than Blocks of Duty if anything.. The whole building aspect is utterly pointless in game, because there is no way to shoot over anything two blocks tall, meaning you can't use cover to protect yourself while you reload and fire from it. Heck,  the mere act of building takes ages, and it is much easier to just ignore building all together and just shoot at each other. Even breaking the map isn't fun, let alone the fact that it can sometimes be very easy to fall off said map without warning in some places.\n\nSeems the only building element in the game is for the guns, which of course is easier said than done, since it requires third-party programs in order to fully complete your gun, and even then it could still get denied if it doesn't meet certain requirements.. The guns that do pass, however, are frustrating beasts to deal with.\n\nSo, you can't build (let alone even use) cover in a game where you die really easily, the combat is pretty much CoD in block form, and oh yeah, some of the maps suck pretty bad too.. Can it get worse? How about the fact that the community is so small that it is depressing to just think about it?\n\nReally, if you want a fun block builder/shooter game, stick with Build and Shoot, it is free and much funner than this, let alone it probably has more players than this game ever will.. And BaS doesn't even have a large community either, so that is saying a lot.","October 31, 2014","false","5.2"," 14 of 27 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","14","27","0","8"

At many points I'll create a gun thinking it is good and have it actually suck horribly against the default guns. Naturally, one would tweak it to accomodate for its errors, but every gun has to get approved, and this process could take hours.\n\nSo, due to its mediocre gunsmithing feature and its mediocre gameplay, I'm going to tell you to NOT get this game at full price.

It was pieced together with about as much finesse as some of the shoddier Minecraft mods, but without all the advanced base functionality that Minecraft brings to the table. This is literally a voxel-based shooter, nothing more, nothing less. If you were hoping to spend hours immersed in servers, alternating between building and shooting, then you will be sorely disappointed.\n\nThat being said, the maps are impressive, if not somewhat awkward occasionally. They certainly seem to be where 99% of the development work was concentrated.

From what I've played the only things that actually stood out for me was that you could create guns then submit it to the public and do something like minecraft where you can destroy blocks and place them. However, I wouldn't call this a Minecraft spin-off at all because Minecraft is much more fun. Even the attributes has major problems, such as finding any good weapons that are fun to use is rare, and placing blocks down costs currency rather than gathering blocks, still with the currency there's no purpose to place or destroy the blocks in the first place. Building a base is pointless because the map designs have been made so that there are nearly no cases whatsoever where this block system would be useful, and destroying blocks most of the time take so long that it'd be shorter to walk around the obstacle rather than tunnelling through. Thus, the final nail that's driven into this game's coffin for me is that besides both the poorly made attributes above it's nothing more than the mindless "press the button to kill whatever's on your screen" strategy which a lot more games do, and a better job of doing it as well. So if you're into mindless shooting at pixels on your screen with a minute amount of varity in it than buy it, other wise can't recommend.","January 12, 2014","false","4.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

You can litterally build anything you desire, from a rocket shooting cat to a SMG doughnut.\n\nI know the games has its flaws, but the developers are hardworking and tries to fix everything they can as quick as possible. A lot of the negative reviews on steam was before the game got its facelift and new features, and I feel people should change their review to reflect the changes made. The game wasn't perfect at launch, but it has blossomed into a great FPS you can enjoy with your friends and family.\n\nPs.

I just enjoy them ALOT.. :)\n\nLets start with the good stuff:\nMultiplayer online is really fun. You can crete your own characters and choose your outfitt. There is also veichles avaliable to enjoy online: You can drive tanks, helicopters, hoverbikes or use stationary  machinegun nests and more. All maps can be destroyed so never expect to be able to hide for to long. :) The game is created so that the community can make there own guns, skins or maps for sharing. Fun fun fun...\n\nI would recommend that you buy a 4 pack and share with your friends for some fun gaming.\n\nAnd sadly some tumbs down:\nHonest opinion singleplayer is onslaught played in lan mode. Is it hard to put a menu singleplayer onslaugt? with some medals to unlock or something???\n\nTo publish the skins or guns content you created. The community has to vote ingame before it comes online. This may sound good on paper but then you must HAVE AN ACTIVE COMMUNITY AS WELL.\n\nTexture DLC's should have been included ingame from the start. Because its promoted as a creative building game "maps and guns" so why not give the tools "textures" so people can make something usefull and fun???\n\nAnd yes the score:\nGFx 8-10 (Usefull comparisons Minecraft, Blockstorm, Murder Miners, Blockland)\nSfx 6-10 (its okay but nothing more)\nMusic 6-10 (Fits nicely to the game)\nGameplay 9-10 (Easy to create maps and fun to play online)\n\nI will recommend this game because its really fun online. And who does not like blowing stuff to bits or creating your own maps to play with your friends. (( Get it on 50-75% SALE ))\n\nOther games to look for: Blockstorm or Murder Miners","December 28, 2014","true","19.8"," 13 of 26 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","13","26","0","8"

The thompson (custom gun, downloadable through steam) is by far the most overpowered gun in the game, it has the best accuracy of all guns, increadably fast fire rate and high damage. That's why all the noobs use that gun.\nThe heads of the player are bigger than their body, so headshots are way too easy.\nAnd if that's not enough overpowered things, you have the vehicles. Vehicles should make this game, but sadly they break it.\n\nCommunity\nThis game has a very small but fun and noob friendly community.\nShout-out to Redcorpian, Zusheqiel and turbozack for keeping the community kind of alive.\n\nUpdates\nShort: None\nMore in-depth: When you ask the developers of Guncraft when a new update will come out, their answer is "soon". But their interpretation of "soon" differs a lot from most peoples interpretation. From 1 january until now we had no big update. For a long time they were saying that a big "thing" would come, but it turned out to be the Humble Bundle sale -_-\nThey also made some block packs so they can make some more money before the game finally dies.\n\nGamemodes\nThere are some nice gamemodes that I haven't seen in other games, but sadly there is nobody to play these gamemodes with.\n\n\nI had hope for this game, but not anymore (like a lot of people). If the game is on sale again and you can convince your friends to buy this game, you should buy it and you can have a lot of fun. But otherwise, don't buy it.","August 10, 2014","false","121.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","9"
