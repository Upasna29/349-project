Under it hides one of the most engaging serial murder thrillers ever written for a point ‘n’ click adventure game, completed by a bit cruel, but somewhat realistic puzzles.\n\nLong version: I’ll be honest: Still Life is my favourite adventure game. It was developed by Microïds, a French company known for their unique titles, and uses the same gameplay system that was introduced in Benoît Sokal’s Syberia. This system is also its main drawback, since it is designed for very slow play. Everything will seem sluggish, even for this genre: walking speed, dialogues, even the user interface. It’s not as bad as the old FMV adventure games, but it’s up there.\n\nOn the other hand, all the other areas in game design are almost flawless. The main character, Victoria is a little bit clichéd tough-girl FBI agent stereotype, but she quickly evolves into an interesting character. Throughout the game, she is placed into a lot of neo-gothic scenery that just oozes atmosphere, all to emphasise the urban fantasy theme of the Jack the Ripper style killings she is investigating.\nThe story has another side though: we learn that these killings copy events that already happened in the 1920s in Prague, and Vic’s grandfather (the protagonist of the quasi-prequel, Post Mortem) was involved in them. His segments not only offer insight, but serve as a contrast to Vic’s world with its washed out tone and almost cruel grittiness.\n\nThe plot may have sort of a fantasy vibe to it, but the gameplay doesn’t. Progressing feels quite natural and realistic, but not without obvious adventure game puzzles like the clock at the morgue or the cookie recipe. Some of them may be a little too cruel, but the reward is always worth it… even if the ending won’t give the satisfaction of closure one may expect– unless they are accustomed to modern French thrillers.","October 7, 2015","true","5.2"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","20","23","0","0"

Overall, it was more frustrating and lame than fun, so ultimately I can't really recommend it. If you already have it (and SL2!), you might as well try and see for yourself. But I did think of abandoning the game quite a few times during it.\nIMPORTANT: The story ends with a huge cliffhanger, which I hope to be the starting point in Still Life 2. It doesn't even feel like an ending to a game, but to a chapter. So don't get/play this one if you don't plan on buying/playing the sequel.\n\nPros:\nAlthough unoriginal, the story is interesting\nIt was nice changing back and forth between the two ages in the game\nSome characters are interesting and well-developed\nCons:\nThey've missed the mark on difficulty--puzzles are either ridiculously easy or insanely hard. Either way, it's never rewarding\nLack of BGM on most scenes is lame\nMost of the game consists of moving back and forth to solve boring puzzles... and moving back and forth is a really slow process\nSome characters and dialogs are stupid\nThe ending is really frustrating--seems like the end of a chapter\nDialog system makes you click for each topic... but there's almost no topic do choose from. Basically, sometimes you have two options: left click for important dialogs, right click for idle chat. But most of the time it's just the left-click. So instead of going smoothly through the dialog, they make us click every three phrases just to pretend we're actually doing something\nBought on / for: Arctic Bundle by Bundle Stars, for an average price of US$ 0.36.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MiCi462/recommended/46480/","MiCi462","MiCi 💜","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MiCi462/","50 products in account","I'll start off by telling that Still Life is the second game of a trilogy. Post Mortem, introduces one of the protagonists, Gus McPherson but playing the prequel is not mandatory to understand what's going on, although it can help in understanding some of the background story. This game itself ends in a cliffhanger, so playing Still Life 2 is necessary to complete the story.\n\nYou play as Victoria McPherson who is a young FBI agent in Chicago with a reputation for ignoring procedure. She's investigating a series of brutal murders. When visiting her father during the holidays, she has a peek into her Grandfather Gus's trunk. He was a PI in the 20's and it seems that one of his last cases bears an eerie similarity to the one Victoria is investigating now.\n\nThe game allows you to use forensic tools such as dusting for fingerprints, using a revealer spray to show cleaned up blood stains, taking photographs and looking for bits of clothing or hair left on the scene but it's used sparingly. Some of the puzzles definitely require the use of a walkthrough and keep in mind that the game switches protagonists on occasion between Victoria and Gus.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=671555250\nWhile it may not be one of the best or innovative adventures ever, it certainly is one of my personal favorites.","April 24","true","7.2"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","0"

We start the game straight with a crime scene and you have to do the classic actions: talk, examine and so on. It's interesting the accurate level of interactions, when you need to use forensic tools. Unfortunately the title is old so it isn't updated or anything. Fortunately I didn't have any bad issue with my laptop (which is quite new: i5, nvidia 840m, win 10 64bit) and I've been able to play without any trouble such as crashes or freezes.\n\n+++Pros+++ STORY. Victoria McPherson is an FBI Agent working on a serial killer case. Reading her grandfather's diary (Post Mortem's Gus McPherson) she will realize he worked on a case where a serial killer was operating with the same Modus Operandi as her Serial Killer. You will both control Victoria and (through a sort of flashback) her grandfather trying to solve both their cases. A small note: consider this title as a first chapter of a whole story, which is concluded in the second Still Life. I won't say more to prevent spoilers.\nCHARACTERS. I loved the characters. Each one with his or her own personality, all their dialogues are so credible, and they're well dubbed, I believe. A cast very well built.\nGRAPHIC. OK, the game is quite old so it's not a matter of resolution or shaders, but of visual aspect. All the scenarios are so beautiful and fascinating, with desaturated color tone that gives them a very dark aspect and creating an excellent atmosphere.\nRIDDLES. The game presents a nice variety of riddles that involve the classic interaction between items, a more deep and precise interaction between multiple items, scheme puzzles, lockpicking (very tough one, solutions in the web are wrong as well, I had to improvise in the last section), Verbal clues that hide codes and so on. ---Cons--- Dialogues. when you're talking with someone you can choose with left or right mouse click to talk about the case or generic stuff... You don't get to choose the line parts like in old classic point & click adventure nor you don't see what you're about to say. It's not an important thing since you inevitably end up talking about everything with everyone but I kind of missed this option, as a Classic point & click lover.\nResolution. Unfortunately the game has quite the age, you can't change any graphic detail, nor resolution.\n4:3. Considering the age the other problem is the aspect ratio. Unfortunately it wasn't studied for 16:9 monitors.\nSpeaking animations. I Have no idea if it's a problem caused by my OS (Win 10), the OS Bit (64bit), the modern hardware (Intel i5 + nVidia 840m) but when characters talk they move their mouth at the speed of light. literally. I can't distinguish the frames, they're super fast...","January 22","true","6.8"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

She soon gets personally involved as her family seems to be connected to the investigation from the past. Here it is going to get really interesting. You are jumping back in time and witness some elaborated places in Prague in the 20’s playing Vic’s granddad who was the former PI in a very similar case. While stranded in the past and finding out how everything started you get interrupted by reality, just as new information comes up for our present investigation. While talking to possible suspects and witnesses, doing usual detective work (including going rogue after an argument with the boss, being suspended and facing the bad guys on your own), you will also discover some brutal murder scenes.\n\nYou will be presented action scenes, outstanding storytelling and good character development. The gameplay requires some getting used to, especially the use of the inventory. While playing, you can easily miss out on objects, but you do not carry a lot of things at the same time, so putting everything in a useful combination is pretty obvious, but it did not bother me that much. And, like a typical point-and-click game, you also have to solve some puzzles (most people say this is unrealistic and dull, but I always like that most in such kind of games…).\n\nAt first I thought it would be just a usual point-and-click adventure, but afterwards I would say it is one of the best games I played in a long time. The case you have to investigate is getting under your skin - I seldom played such a thrilling point-and-click adventure. Released in 2005 the graphics are not the finest, but it is still enjoyable. The amount of settings is enormous and I praise that the story kept its mystery elements until the end. The sound acting was really good, even though not always in sync.

You play as detective Victoria McPherson who is investigating a string of prosti tute murders, all of whom's bodies were found badly beaten and mutilated. The atmosphere is well done and each crime scene is quite graphic. The style of this game is a classic point and click adventure. As far as game play is concerned, adventure games tend to be vague and it can be difficult to figure out what you are supposed to do next, but that rarely happens in this title. In fact, in Still Life, it is usually very obvious what you are supposed to do - but that's the hard part. The puzzles in this game range from rather simple to frustratingly demanding. While the puzzles do become immensely complex, the puzzles are also very logical. I personally spent about 30-40 minutes trying to figure out one of the difficult puzzles in this game. So if you are going to play this title, you need to have patience and a strong penchant for puzzle solving. This isn't a title you can just rush through (unless you look up all the solutions, but that seems kind of silly). The graphics are a bit dated and the voice acting while good/ok, isn't top notch.

The plot revolves around an agent investigating serial murders in Chicago and discovering that her grandfather investigated the same type of murders in Prague decades ago. While the dialogue is pretty campy, the story is amazingly gripping at times and the pre-rendered backgrounds are extremely well done and atmospheric.  Smooth transitions between the Chicago story and Prague keep the game interesting as you uncover clues from the past and present, playing as both Victoria and her grandfather. Nothing can hurt your character but there were a few moments of dread as she searches through some intensely disturbing areas of the game and gets uncomfortably closer to finding the killer. Movement is a bit clunky though and there are times when you feel like you're waiting endlessly for her to reach her destination, even when can run (more like brisk jog).

The 800x600 maximum resolution is disappointing. A game of this caliber with a 2005 release date on a PC platform deserves higher end graphical support.\n\nCharacter development is genuine providing a sense of realism, but there is a lack of involvement on the players part to really control events--the result is a lot of mindless clicking to advance conversations. You also have to do everything in a predefined order which in many cases seems pointless. For example you can't pick up certain objects until you discover a use for them and you can't leave certain areas without completing necessary tasks.\n\nOverall, it was worth the play through, but I became weary near the game's end due to the abrupt turnaround in the main character combined with minor game annoyances. The ending sets up for Still Life 2, but ultimately leaves a feeling of unfulfillment as a stand alone game.","August 21, 2011","true","15.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Still Life 1 pretty much avoids both these pitfalls, but at the cost of making it incredibly simplistic: 4 hours in, and I still know exactly where I'm supposed to use any of the few items I find. The only challenge comes from Professor Layton style puzzles, which I actually think err a little on the heavy side; get ready for matching rows of interlocking rotating cylinders and extended versions of the "the wolf can't cross the river with the sheep" puzzles. If these were a little easier I'd want to attempt them myself, but seeing all the variables on each of these is pretty daunting. While the plot sounds interesting, the dialgoue has been tortuous so for, both in writing and voice acting. People seem to speak too slowly, try on "jokes" in the middle of a macabre crime scene, and none of the many foreigners are even attempting to do an accent. Not to necessarily dissuade you from this point-&-click, just make sure you know what you're getting into.","January 10, 2013","false","3.8"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","11","20","0","0"

Since it is currently the Autumn Steam Sale I figured I write up a review for those currently looking to buy it.\n\nStill Life is a 3D interactive puzzle adventure that follows a single muder mystery case that unfolds from the perspective of two different characters, FBI Agent McPherson (In 2004 US Chicago) and her PI Grandfather Gustav McPherson (In 1920s Czech Rep Prague) . Neither of these two characters interact directly with the other; Gustav McPherson's story is told through diary.\n\nIn general there's not much difference in gameplay that occurs during a switch of characters as it is mostly done for narritives sake. In terms of gameplay Still Life's is fairly weak. Much of the interaction in the game mainly comes from chosing the correct person to talk to, using the right items/objects and solving a few puzzles. The puzzles themselves are actually very well thought out and surprisingly difficult! I actually found myself at wits end on a puzzle and am ashamed to say that I actually had to find help online!\n\nGraphics wise Still Life looks quite dated now a days. A lot of the lip synching when a character speak looks incredible jarring. Mouths on some characters look more like nutcrakers when they talk.... On the flipside character models themselves are well designed and look quite decent too! Where Still Life really shines though is in the Pre renderded enviroments. If you're a fan of early Resident Evil games or like looking at background art in general, you will enjoy the look and immersion of the enviroments that the visual departments in Still Life offers.\n\nThough honestly the main reason anyone should really play Still Life would be for its story and characters! Over all I feel like the characterization of everyone in Still Life is done very realisticly. A lot of the dialouge does a very good job explaining the lives and personalities of the people they are suppose to represent. It's been more than a few months since I've played this game and though I can't recall completely by heart all the names of the characters; the use of the voice actors and the roles the characters played in the story themselves are embedded quite well into my mind.\n\nAlso mild spoiler alert but I have to point this out as it's a slight ♥♥♥♥ move on the developers part. The story ends on a cliff hanger! You don't catch your murderer. You have to buy part two to wrap up this case. Because of this I recommend that if you want all of your monies worth that you buy this game when it is on sale.

Very linear adventure game with a classic "detective" story. Two time-lines are nice idea. Visual is not the best, but taking year of the origin, its quite alright. What is not OK is almost everything else. Dialogs can not be chosen what to say, you just click and click and listen. No interaction. Puzzles are most of the time dumb. The worst puzzle ever is baking cookies. WTF? Lockpicking is another messed up puzzle, that is not a fun to play. Gameplay is very slow, just waiting until your character goes over the screen (yes, you can run, but it is not much of an improvement). This is real game killer in last part game puzzles, where you wait like an idiot until your "robot" walks slowly to the position.\n40%","July 20, 2015","false","8.5"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

No there isn't a cool Hannibal character, but this game has a gritty realism to it. Most point and clicks deal with fantasy and sci-fi subjects and puzzles that would not be in real life. This is a point and click for adults if there ever was one. A serial killer with a twisted sense of art is on the loose and you are the agent who is going to stop him. This game does not shy away from gory details. Get ready for autopsies, visiting gory crime scenes, and delving into the mind of a lunatic. If thats not enough, get ready to visit some sketchy locations such as a house of ill repute with a serious S&M complex. Without spoiling the story, the game feelis like you are playing two games, since this game spans two time periods, and you are playing as two detectives. I love the look of the game. For those familiar with Syberia, expect the same level of excellence, just a completely different atmosphere. The cut scenes can be very exciting to watch. Some of the cut scenes can be gratifying to watch while others can be difficult. I believe this game is one of those overlooked gems that seriously needs more press.","October 25, 2012","true","30.2"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

However, as with other Microid adventure games the game is filled with nearly empty screens with beatiful art and just 1 or 2 clickable objects. Also the very fact that the game actually does NOT end at the end really reduces the value of Still Life a lot.\nMost of the time the game holds your hand about what to do and where to go. So until you hit a puzzle or a weird item search sequence, Still Life is very similar to an interactive movie. Everytime during the game, you have a VERY limited set of options about where to go and what to click. As for the puzzles, while some of them are good there are several puzzles which hugely disrupts the narrative of the story (ex. a cookie baking puzzle). Also, the dialogues and characters are usually very one dimensional and filled with clichés.","February 24, 2014","false","10.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Not because it was well done, but because it was so poorly done.\nPlay this game just to notice flaws, laugh at the sheer retardation of the entirety of it, and enjoy yourself.\nBut if you wanna be a downie debbie and demand perfection from your games, do not buy this.\nBut if you want just a fun ♥♥♥♥ game you don't feel guilty blasting through with a walkthrough for the puzzles, just to laugh at its sheer unrelatable in any way circumstances, you could do ALOT worse.\nPicked up the second one to see if they managed to keep it nice and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ like this one.\nGL, HF.","May 1, 2014","true","7.5"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","7","16","0","4"

It sucks. Hard. It sells itself as a video game CSI type adventure and it is..for exactly 20 minutes at the start, but then it turns into one of the worst adventure games I've ever played (seriously, there's actually a Christmas cookie baking puzzle in this). The bad acting is maybe forgivable, but not so the plot which is a tedious hodgepodge of warmed over serial killer film clichés, the terrible dialogue, and the horrible out of context "puzzle" puzzles (I don't mind overt puzzles when they fit the narrative, but why, for example, would construction workers lock their crane using an elaborate logic puzzle rather than, you know, a key?). And on top of this it doesn't even have the decency to have a real ending. Instead, it just kind of ends abruptly leaving all mysteries entirely unsolved.\n\nAnyone who says this is good should be sentenced to an eternity of solving its lock-picking puzzle.","May 23, 2012","false","16.3"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","6","15","0","1"

The voice acting is so bad that you might as well put the game on mute and read the subtitles which aren't any better. Better yet, dont' even bother playing it. I wish I could go and undo this purchase so that it's no longer a constant reminder to drink and play video games during steam sales. Seriously ♥♥♥♥ you steam, you reeled my broke ♥♥♥ in again while i was hammered. On another note I should probably stop drinking. This game is so bad that is made me stop drinking. Most people would call this a positive thing, but ♥♥♥♥ you I love drinking. I also love playing video games. This game left me stumbling around town sober and not wanting to see a single screen lest it might contain something close to digital entertainment for fear that it could bring back painful memories. I'm a complete wreck now. I had to build up the courage to crack open a cold one and write a review for this game. NEVER AGAIN STEAM, NEVER AGAIN!

The game's original dialog is in French. The translation to American English was not a responsible or subtle one. I made it to just past the opening credits when the first character the protagonist comes in contact with is an American black police officer. It appears that those responsible for the translation are only familiar with American black people through 19th century minstrel shows. As I can only find one review that discusses this atrocious characterization, and they only refer to it as "borderline racist," I feel some responsibility to inform the Steam community (a community that I consider mostly comprised of responsible and open-minded game consumers) to think twice before purchasing something so offensive.

This game was originally released in 2004 and has aged well. It's a standard graphic adventure game wherein you walk the protagonist around various locations, collect items and solve classic puzzles.\n\nPros: Good story/characters. The graphics are still acceptable. Puzzle difficulty increases as the story progresses. Gameplay length is acceptable: You'll get a minimum of 4 hours from it. A PDF walkthrough is included with your purchase.\n\nCons: Can't play in windowed mode. The resolution is locked at 1024x768, making the graphics a bit grainy on a 1920x1080 desktop. 95% of the f-bombs and exposed breasts are gratuitous and exterraneous to the tale. A couple hiccups in the French-to-English translation (re: the cookie recipe uses metric tools but gives you imperial instructions.)\n\nMicroids "Syberia" series is far superior so buy that instead.

La trama prende molto, non si riesce davvero a smettere di giocare, si ha sempre voglia di sapere come va avanti... La grafica è tipica dei giochi un po' vecchi, ma i luoghi sono molti e davvero molto carini. Personalmente adoro la casa del padre di Vic. Le voci non sono male, ma dipende dal personaggio. Non ci sono molti hot spots (come accade in Black Mirror, dove sentire i commenti del protagonista fa fare sempre due risate), ma forse la cosa migliore del gioco è che a differenza della maggior parte delle avventure grafiche (come ahimè anche nel sequel) non bisogna fare abbinamenti assurdi e impensabili tra gli oggetti per andare avanti: è tutto molto logico.

The first game required very exquisite guess work, and was very hard. This game removed all the talking options that I loved in Post Mortum. Yeah I found that mechanism annoying at times, but it allowed for a personal touch.\n\nStill life was great, although I didn't like how every mechanism was only used once. We used black lights, plastic machine, finger prints and etc. and all of them are barely even used. It is completly on rails with few puzzles along the way. Of course I used a walkthrough cause I was in a hurry to get to the puzzles and unfold the story quicker, but you can easily tell why this game isn't that popular, and only a little game that is only relevent because Steam is around, and cheap gamers looking for cheap games.","March 13, 2014","true","12.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A young female agent working for the FBI in Chicago who stumbles upon a series of murders that are all connected to a case Gus was involved with 80 years prior. Unlike the Post Mortem game, this entry of the "Still Life" trilogy is done differently. There's no series of multiple dialoge choices so it's a more linear storyline and the cast of characters are what make this game a real joy to play. I did enjoy the characters from Post Mortem, but the cast of Still Life takes the prize on that category. Vic is a cool heroine full of attitude, humor, and spunk. She's the type of woman I would ask out on a date. While the background designs are much more elabrate and the music score is very top notch than what was present in Post Mortem. The Chicago masked killer is more memorible than the Paris masked killer with the whole motif of Jack the Ripper meets the Phantom of the Opera. Overall the game is a living form of art that will please the eye of art lovers or video game designers.","March 19, 2015","true","10.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/r3nie/recommended/46480/","r3nie","r3nie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/r3nie/","75 products in account","Personal Rating: 9/10 - category "point&click"\nThis game has everything that a fan of point&click games would desire and is an absolute must-have for those who are into the genre!\nIt focuses mostly on an intense story with a great atmosphere, that is only accompanied by random puzzles here and there. The game makes the player actually think about what would be the next logical step to do, instead of just hinting to the next location or which object to click next. And it actually always is logical! As opposed to so many other point&click games that just drive you crazy because the actions are just so stupid and random.\nIt generally emphasizes on an actual realistic feel to the whole game, which goes from random character interactions, over cut scenes to animations for waiting for the elevator, getting inside your car or walking. Looooots of walking in this game.\nYou switch between two playable characters that are bound by plot (and blood as well!).\n\nCharacters & voice acting:\nThe female protagonist is very likeable. She's smart, devoted and the player can always relate to her actions. Also she has a great fashion taste (...them bunny slippers).\nThe male protagonist is just as clever, and his story is even more horrid and disturbing.\nThe realistic feel of the game and it's characters authenticity are surely thanks to the great voice acting. Bad voice acting can really ruin a game for you, but that's absolutely not the case here. The voices fit the characters and they also emphasize the words just perfectly, always fitting the current situation. (That's usually a thing that really pisses me off with other games).\n\nStory/Setting/Atmosphere/Graphics:\nThis game has an overall intense and authentic feel to it which is also thanks to the very interesting setting we have here.\nThe story takes place in a modern Chicago with 'flashbacks' to the Victorian Era at Prague. There's a moderate change of scene in the game and you can switch through all the detailed locations at will at any time. What really makes the game interesting is the great location scenery with very detailed graphics in variation with animations as well a lot of cool cut scenes, which really make it feel like you're watching an action movie at times!\nThe buildings and some of the rooms are made in a futuristic style which is interesting as well (a brothel that looks like it's taken from a sci-fi movie and her house just looks like a giant church.)\n\nPuzzles:\nSo, there is not a lot of actual puzzles in this game. Maybe 10 or so, I'm not sure, but it wasn't that many. Which wasn't neccesarily a bad thing, since they really have what it takes. Maybe they're too hard even, but I eventually all figured them all out, except for one where I had to use a guide.\nLike I already said, the game focuses more on "logical" puzzles as to where to go/what to do next, more than actual puzzles.\n\nControls:\nSo. Here it is. The reason why I could give the game only 9 points and in my opinion it's only flaw.\nRight at the beginning of the game I was totally unable to figure out the item menu and it took me a while to understand the functionality. It wasn't explained anywhere. There were a few other moments during the course of the game, where it still made me some troubles.\nAnd then there's the walking. Like I already said, looooots of it. You have to change locations quite a lot, especially if you're not sure on where to go next, and just randomly want to check out some places. See if you missed something. That's when the frustration starts. First there's the animation of getting into your car, then the animation of you getting out of your car (and walking a few steps). The characters can actually run, by double-clicking somewhere. But you can't "speed travel" to the next room, by double-clicking on the door for example. So you have to watch your character walk all the way to the end of the screen. Then walking to the elevator. Then the animation for pressing the elevator button. Then the animation of the character inside the elevator. Then the animation of getting out of the elevator... and so on, you get where I'm going with this.\nI get that they wanted to make the game seem "realistic", but that's just too much, it's still a game after all. Also, the whole game seems to take place in one single night! (which doesn't really fit to the story at all).\nThey never mention her going to sleep or anything, she's a freakin zombie! So much for realism.\n\nConclusion (tl;dr):Great game with great characters, a great atmosphere, challenging puzzles, but bad controls.\n\nI hope they fixed all the negative aspects in the 2nd game, that's next to play for me.","March 25, 2015","true","10.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Non ci sono molti hot spots (come accade in Black Mirror, dove sentire i commenti del protagonista fa fare sempre due risate), ma forse la cosa migliore del gioco è che a differenza della maggior parte delle avventure grafiche (come ahimè anche nel sequel) non bisogna fare abbinamenti assurdi e impensabili tra gli oggetti per andare avanti: è tutto molto logico.

Decent story.\nEverything else is bad. In terms of both: a gameplay and an implementation.\nHowever, Still Life 2 is different case; second part includes the escape room gameplay which is much more ineteresting,","April 12","false","30.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is interesting enough, though the ending is a bit of a cop out to get you to play the second game. The port is OK, but a lot of times the walking messes up. I also found the walking painfully slow. I imagine 1/2 the time spent on the game, is walking.\n\nSemi-spoilerish points:\n\nI like the little dated references like the X-Files poster, and the windows screen savers.\n\nThe storyline between present and past was really interesting. But in some spaces it had so much detail almost too much, and in others left giant holes. There are a few characters we meet that dont seem to do much for the story or progression at all but they are given big chunks. The ending felt like a bit of a copout for me.\n\nSide note I totally cant stand that they keep saying "sweety" and "honey" it makes no sense.","May 29","true","15.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Getting to places inevitablyy involves watching the same clips of your character walking to the edge of the screen, standing in a lift and so forth. It gets boring quick.\n\nOther than that, it's a solid game.","May 28","true","10.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
