Sometimes you aren't visibly touching one of the red bullets, but you die\n- The music gets repetitive really fast (even more that in Orborun)\n- Unispired level designs\n- It's really fast to complete. I didn't finish the game, but I reached level 14 of 30 levels in about 40 min\n- Really buggy, sometimes if you fall to a platform the hit detection disapears and you glitch through it, resulting in a restart of the level\n\nIt's worth the full price?\nNo.If you really want it, I only reccomend it at, at least, 75% off (1 euro)","September 19, 2015","false","0.9"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","16","17","0","0"

There are gameplay issues, technical issues and just a lack of experience in my opinion. For starters, it doesn't support resolutions over 1080p. This game shipped July 2015. I'd expect higher resolution. The dyanamic shadow resolutions is absolutely horrendous and there is no settings to increase it. Performance wise it runs fine but changing v-sync will require a restart for it to apply properly. Worse part is there is no sensitivity setting, in a game that is all about 3D physics movement. Also you can't rebind your joystick axises. Finally some playtesting would have highlighted some pretty big flaws with the game where you end up in a broken state too often. To sum up, I was looking forward to a finished game and would have been happy to pay more but instead I got this.","August 20, 2015","false","0.1"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","60","6","10","3","0"

I love that is challenging, it has some kind of difficults mechanics. If you love platformers and games that will make you rage on frustration this is the game for you. Highly recommended.","July 31, 2015","true","2.9"," 7 of 28 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","7","28","0","0"
