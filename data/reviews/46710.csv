The gameplay is barely there, all you can do is steer your columns of ships and tell them when to start firing.  you can't target specific enemy ships, you get very little info about the status of any ships.  I was very dissapointed as I really wanted this game to be at least ok.","June 21, 2015","false","0.4"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","17","20","0","0"

There's only one mode of play - buy a fleet of ships then set them against eachother in a fleet action.  In the battle phase of the game there's very little to actually do.  Your ships are grouped into three squadrons and for each squadron you can pick a speed and course, and whether or not the ships can open fire or not.  And that's pretty much the total gameplay.  You can't pick your targets.  You can't choose ammunition types.  There's no damage control or firefighting.  You can't grapple and board.  Because the game is set in the "High Seas" (despite using river monitors!) the battles are in completely open ocean, without so much as an island to add variety.  I finally gave up on this game when a ship ramming another amidships had absolutely no effect whatsoever.\n\nGraphics are barely adequate, music and sound effects are okay.  It's like someone started a project to do a naval combat game and got the code to the absolute minimal running state before abandoning it.  You might be tempted to buy this if you see it cheap.  Don't.  However little you pay for it, you won't get your money's worth.","September 20, 2015","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
