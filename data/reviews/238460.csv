Horse .. its called capture the horse which is same as CTF but a horse that looks like a piece of walking candy, and even more fun\nOr Basketball which is my personal favorite and its something you wont play just once : )\nAnd a lot more Modes from soul catcher ( Kill and get their souls) To "Grab the gold"  9 Different fun modes.\n\nThe mechanism of the game makes it possible to do a great teamwork in adventure mode.\nYou can pick up your friend and throw him or he just simply jumps on your head to reach a high place and then lifts you up to join him, or use a weapon to blast your friend to a certain places, and just be creative with what you wanna do :).\n\nA huge selection of weapons and faces, ( You can make your own face and put it in game folder for everyone to see)\nthe game is basically Get the (Certain number) of Gems in each level and reach the end in the best time ( And the hidden yarn ball )\nGems buys you Faces, Yarn balls buys Weapons.\n\nWITH! the ability to Trade them in-game or in steam trading system, or even sell them on steam market.\nWhich is a good feature because you cant buy a certain thing you just buy and the outcome is random.\n\nEach weapon is different and has a different use and great ways to make combos with.\nYou can either play good to finish, play dirty team killing, or see who can reach the end first.\nSome levels however relies on teamwork cant afford to be selfish there.\n\nWith this ADORABLE looking graphics and soundtracks fun can never end, They made it even more fun by making Level Editor to make your own levels/playlists of levels, arenas or whatever the hell you want to make.\nSteam workshop was definitely a great feature for the steam version.\n\nTHIS Game has the FUNNIEST STORY I have ever seen in a video game, Every Cut scene you will be a FOOL to skip it because its just ... too .. funny and perfect with that amazing narrator.\n\nits sad that they asked that no one posts a review or livestream or a video while on beta, but everyone did anyway .... and so i tried to make this review as resourceful as possible, so people would actually get a clue of what this game is if they never heard of it before or was wondering about it.\n\nThis game is worth every penny, watch some youtube commentary videos on its gameplay and decide for yourself :)\n\n\n\nA Few updates.\n\nthey keep adding some special faces you can get by finishing every once and a while so its cool\n\nand for summer sales people are wondering if the game is worth playing just for singleplayer\nyes , i have maybe 20 hours stored only singleplayer playing this wonderful game alone is also fun and the levels changes when you play singleplayer to be set to solo mode ( Makes it possible to do everything solo ) and in multiplayer they are set for double so you need someone else to help you finish the level or you can also use the weapons to do it alone if you're good enough with them.\n\nSo yeah its pretty much fun singleplayer grinding for faces and achievements is always fun : )\nhopefully you'll make the right choice and buy this and make sure you have friends to play with\nits more fun that way","May 14, 2014","true","55.2"," 1,568 of 1,704 people (92%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","92","568","1","4","41"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dahdoctow/recommended/238460/","dahdoctow","Gorbis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dahdoctow/","349 products in account","Amazing game. I honestly wasn't expecting this to be as good as it was, despite being a good fan of Castle Crashers.  The videos of it didn't look too terribly interesting, but lemme tell ya. This is definitely a game worth picking up. This game actually has much smoother framerate than the previous The Behemoth release on steam, Castle Crashers. It runs without a hitch, and without a framerate cap.\n\nI thought the voice acting of one of my personal vocal heroes was top-notch. (Definitely left a "stamp"... Dohohohoho...) The jokes were often corny, but it was tightly written in kind of a "I know this writing is bad, so I might as well go all out" kind of way. Makes it feel very light-hearted which is much appreciated in this barrage of "oh ♥♥♥♥, another gray Call of Gooby."\n\nThe controls feel very tight, although I do actually find the combat to be rather clunky. However the combat isn't as important as the platforming aspects, which are top notch. The variation of weapons are also a plus. Speaking of variation, I have a lot of work ahead of me if I want to unlock all of those heads hahaha.\n\nThe music fit the game nicely, and while it doesn't stand out, it is the perfect ambiance I need to push through and play in a "zenned out" state.\n\nI recommend this game to everyone who is into platformers. It's such a great game and you should not pass it up.","May 9, 2014","true","18.4"," 289 of 321 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","289","321","0","0"

- YouTube\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5EaBkeo_7E\n\nThe gameplay itself consists of taking on various level's (as you open up new part's of the prison---"SORRY THEATER") and whilst doing so trying to collect all the green gem's and also the ball's of wool (this game does have cat's in so naturally ball's of wool-trust me it goes along with how nutty this game is),now you dont need to collect all of them in the level to get past it,no you just need to find three of them and then the lock opens and the exit is clear.But that is part of the fun of playing the game as you try to find all the gem's and ball's of wool to get that A++ rating for that level.\nAs you progress through the game the challenge's on the level's get tougher and you end up having to pull of jump's and move's that have to be spot on for you to progress,now this doesnt matter on the normal level's but on the timed ones can cause you some absolute "SCREAM OUT" moments of pure frustration (honestly i didnt get like that-OH YES YOU DID-NO I DIDNT-YES YOU DID-OK I DID ALRIGHT),but this all add's to the charm of the game as you have that "one last go" moment which can last you for hours (trust me i KNOW).\nThe sound in game is one of the highlight's also,and the narrator is one of the funniest thing's i have ever heard in a game in a long time (dare i say i will remember him as much as the narrator from BASTION) and the thing's he say's (his constant "OH DEAR" and other comment's as you die are hillarious) and the song's he sing's will stay with you for quite some time.\n\nBattleBlock Theater Development: Narration by Will Stamper ...\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FR1MXOb50c\n\nNow the gem's you earn and the ball's of wool you find are used in game as currency for the thing's you will eventually find yourself buying.Gem's purchase head's and some of these are great and have had a lot of thought and some seem to be just after thought's,but trust me that "POKEMON" bug will grab you and you will find yourself wanting to "GOTTA GET THEM ALL" (see just like pokemon),the ball's of wool you trade to the cats (WELL THAT FIT'S DUH) for more weapon's and these all seem to play out slightly differently from the boomerang to the grenade they all work slightly differently than the last one did.\nHaving finished the solo version of the game (and the later level's get really challenging-especially the timed one's),i moved on to the multiplayer side of the game.\nNow this seems to play out just like the solo game and that's what i thought until i realised that without the other person to back me up i would get no where (in some game's like this it doesnt really matter about working together but here it does).\n\nBattleBlock Theater - 4 player coop -\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHUntfXN4tc\n\nYou see in co-op the challenge's are actually aimed at there being more than one player and try to play it solo and you will die and fail straight away.I will be playing it more in co-op now i have finished the solo game and find that this actually does add longevity to what is allready (in this reviewers opinion) a top notch and well developed piece of entertainment.\nWill you want to play this game,well answer the 2 following question's and you'll know.\n1 - Do you like game's to have a wicked sense of humour and consist of laugh out moment's ??\n2 - Are you prepared to loose hour's of your life as the bug grabs you and you must A++ that level no matter what ???\nIf you answer yes to both then buy this fantastic game straight away and if not buy it anyway and trust me you will never and i mean "NEVER" regret it.\n\n(I DO NOT OWN ANY OF THE CLIPS OF VIDEOS PUT UP IN THIS REVIEW AND THEY BELONG TO THEIR RESPECTIVE OWNERS AND ARE THEIRS BY COPYRIGHT)","May 25, 2014","true","247.9"," 198 of 242 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","198","242","0","15"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shikono/recommended/238460/","shikono","Elfee","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shikono/","382 products in account","The Behemoth’s 2D platformer BattleBlock Theater is full of quirky humor (like in Castle Crashers which is also a Behemoth game).\n\nThis game is not only for platformer-lovers. It's for all who like great entertainment, for gamers who love to play alone, for those who love to play coop, for the creative people and level builders, for the achievement hunters, the item collectors and people who want to own others!\n\nHumor:\nI really enjoyed the opening monologue and all the other little movies between some levels. You will also hear funny comments when you are playing. How to describe the jokes? I would say it’s a mix out of poop jokes with pop-culture references. About some jokes you will laugh and about other jokes you will raise your eyebrow. In harder levels when you are frustrated because you die so often the speaker also makes some taunting statements which motivate you or make you wanna find him and kill him. :o\n10/10\n\nSound:\nNarrator: The narrator talks clearly and with a great accent. I’ve understood everything and my english isn’t the best. So he did his job very well! ^^\nMusic: The songs are always convenient and make a funny, peaceful atmosphere.\nSettings: You can change the volume PLUS how much you want to hear from the talker.\n10/10\n\nGraphic:\nThe game has an amazing quality of animation. Even too the characters have a simple design it’s still cute and clearly what they represent. It animates you to collect more characters in a curious, partial addicted way. And there are so many character styles to collect that everyone will fall in love with one! If you don’t get your favorite with your green diamonds you can also swap with other players.\n10/10\n\nGameplay:\nYou have so many possibilities and different game modes that you don’t know with what you should start. lol Seriously if you really want to do everything in the game with a perfect result you can spend aplenty of your time there. For example there is a storymode (playable on normal and insane difficulty) for singleplayer and a bit different one for coop where you have to throw your partner to some places or to pull him up. Sometimes you just have to jump on his head to reach a gem and sometimes you have to shoot him somewhere… which is really funny especially when your mate dies cause of an accident (stupidly). xD\n\nYou can play features and levels made by other players. PLUS you also can create OWN LEVELS… There are no limits!\n\nBesides you can play with 2-4 players in the arena (choose a fast game or a special game mode). Some modes you can play versus other players: Capture the Horse (it’s like capture the flag in other games e. g. “Booster Trooper”), basketball, teamdeathmatch, soulcatcher and so on!\n\nIn all game modes you can get ‘Gems’ and ‘Yarn balls’. With Gems you can buy faces, with yarn balls weapons. The weapons all make different stuff (e. g. freezing someone into an ice-cube) and different damage or they just blow the enemy away. There are also different ways to make combos with. So you can evolve your own tactic.\n\nFor so many possibilities and no lags in multiplayer I give:\n10/10\n\nTradesystem:\nYou can see all your items (faces, weapons, gems, yarn balls…) in your INVENTORY in Steam. So you can make your trade in-game or with the steam trading system. Means even when you are out of the game you can send someone a trade offer about which items you want to swap. You can also sell some of the items (those which are marketable) or buy some of them. So also those who have no luck with the drops in the game can reach on every way what they want.\nThat’s just awesome!\n10/10\n\nConclusion:\nI am totally in love with this game and I highly recommend it! ♥","July 1, 2014","true","6.0"," 57 of 60 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","57","60","0","14"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cantisque/recommended/238460/","Cantisque","Canti","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cantisque/","2676 products in account","BattleBlock Theater is an updated port of the XBLA version released on Xbox 360 in early 2013. The "Steam version" (as it likes to call itself) adds a wealth of Steamworks features, possibly the most of any game released so far, as well as a few gameplay and visual tweaks. These Steamworks features include Workshop for creating, sharing and downloading user-created levels, Inventory support for item trading, online multiplayer and SteamOS support just to name a few.\n\nThe game comes from The Behemoth, who you may remember as being credited with Alien Hominid (as far as I am aware, the first example of a Newgrounds Flash game making a leap to a commercial gaming console) and more recently with Castle Crashers. Two well-received games under their belt and you’ll be happy to know that you can count BattleBlock Theater as their third.\n\nYou control a miniature Pillsbury Doughboy lookalike, who along with his friends have crashed their “Friend-Ship” onto a mysterious island. Taken prisoner by a legion of insane cats inside a derelict theatre, you are made to run the various obstacle courses (formed of various blocks) and collect gems as you go, purely for their amusement.\n\nDuring the story mode, your goal is to run through 2D platforming stages, collecting any gems and balls of yarn you see as you go. Not only do these collectables contribute to your overall ranking and score for a stage, you can also spend them in the theatre gift shop. Spending gems will free your captive friends (and allow you to play as them) and the yarn, which is usually the trickiest item to find, can be spent on new weapons. Fitting with the crazy theme the game has going for it, weapons range from guns that fire top-hats, to marching frog dancers that explode. Both weapons and unlocked characters can be traded either in-game or through Steam’s own trading system.\n\nYour character comes equipped with the standard platforming skills. They can perform double-jumps, duck and slide to avoid unpleasant things happening to their head and a basic set of melee attacks for the odd occasion where a villainous feline blocks your path.\nAs you progress, the stages become increasingly difficult and complex. The blocks you run and jump over may help you get from start to finish, but not all of them are helpful. Block with spikes, blocks of water (you can’t swim!) and even blocks that fire lazer beams will become more and more numerous as you advance through the 8 chapters the game offers, with 13 stages in each.\nThe puzzles also increase in their level of dastardliness, requiring some extra precise jumps, timings for triggering certain switches that can open new paths or create bridges and some time-trial stages where time is certainly not on your side.\n\nThe story is narrated by the absolutely wonderful voice of Will Stamper who manages to synergise his unique energy with the quirky and slightly demented theme the game has on display perfectly. Add to this that the majority of the spoken dialogue is exceptionally funny, it works wonders to break up the monotony of what would otherwise be a rather mundane platformer.\n\nThe graphics are vivid and colourful, the animations fluid and adorable, capturing The Behemoth’s trademark style that is in itself a thumbs-up to the Flash games of yesteryear. Despite the trailer claiming near infinite FPS and resolution support (made in satire of the “PC master race” mostly), the game is locked to 60FPS and does not scale to non-standard resolutions such as ultra-widescreen displays… I am also guessing you shouldn’t take the “Oculus Rift support” seriously either.\nThe audio mixes bouncy sound effects with a great soundtrack, with Will Stamper lending his vocals to a couple of the song “lyrics” for added hilarity. These are usually limited to the ends of chapters and bonus stages, so as not to overdo it.\n\nThe campaign alone is rather lengthy, but being able to replay stages to get a better ranking, find missing treasures and unlock more goodies really adds to the replayability. To top it all off, there are plenty of great user-created levels to download and a comprehensive level editing suite included, as well as a special event list of downloadable levels released every Friday with a unique unlockable friend as a reward. There are also a heap of multiplayer modes, both competitive and co-op for up to 4 players. These range from classic “king of the hill” and “capture the flag” modes, to races and even basketball. Some fiddling with your firewall may be required to get the multiplayer working, though.\n\nBattleBlock Theater delivers a fantastic package of content that is both highly polished, well-paced and with enough variety to keep you coming back even when the main game is done and dusted. With its delightful audio/visual aesthetic and solid controls on both gamepad and keyboard, this is a platformer that anyone can enjoy.\n\nPros:\n~Great presentation and consistently funny\n~Amazing value for the price\n~Well-balanced difficulty, suitable for all skill levels\n~Incredible number of Steam features supported\n~Developers still actively supporting the game\n\nCons:\n~Multiplayer connectivity can be fiddly on certain routers and firewalls\n~Can’t rebind controller buttons (can rebind keyboard keys, though)","July 14, 2014","true","18.8"," 54 of 62 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","54","62","0","5"

It’s a real shame as I had played and finished the whole of Normal Mode story, and was exactly halfway through Insane Mode story. That data wipe has given me time to pause and think as I write this review.\n\n========================================================\n\nBattleBlock Theater is The Behemoth’s 3rd game release, and 2nd game (after Castle Crashers) to be released on Steam.\n\nThe premise of the game is simple - you and your friends, including a certain Hatty Hattington, are shipwrecked on an island where there is a theater run by cats. Hatty is captured and forced…erm, bewitched…no wait, mind-controlled…you get the point…to become the theater in-charge, while you, along with 200+ prisoners, have to perform in the theater’s wide array of dazzling, death-defying, plays.\n\nThe game is a fast-paced and frantic platformer. Comparisons to other platformers like Super Meat Boy become rather inevitable - both gradually introduce new tricks and mechanics, both have speed goals for each level, and both can get incredibly challenging.\n\nHowever, the similarities end there. For starters, as already mentioned above, BattleBlock Theater has at least 200 playable characters. Unlike SMB, all of them are purely aesthetic. However, it is rather fun for collectors to accumulate every single prisoner that is available. I’ve developed a rather fond attachment towards Aquarius and now use him regularly.\n\nSecondly, your character is able to utilise weapons to fight off enemy cat guards (fattened up for the Steam version! I find they look better too) that you will encounter in the levels. If my troll review did not already make it clear, my favourite is the FrogBomb - a moving proximity bomb that explodes when an enemy is near. Other weapons range from normal (Grenade) to outlandish (“Forceball”). Very varied and interesting types.\n\nRather interestingly, all your BattleBlock Theater inventory is integrated with the Steam inventory. You can trade off your heads, weapons, gems and yarn (the last 2 being the currencies you spend) with other people, or sell off/buy the first two types in the Marketplace. A great way to earn some extra Steam wallet credit by selling off your spare weapons, AND a cut of every sale that takes place goes to The Behemoth too! :)\n\nBesides the solo story mode where you have to save Hatty, there is also multiplayer. While playing online, you can choose to play the co-op story or just smackdown random people in random arena modes.\n\nThe game runs VERY well on my computer - the cutesy 2D hand-drawn art and animation is buttery smooth, I found no instance of lag whatsoever. Kudos to Dan Paladin, he has illustrated yet another hit. Sound effects and music are also rather soothing and energetic in equal measure. (The song that plays during the Finale in each stage is called Buckle Your Pants, composed by Newgrounds moderator Will Stamper, and is the source of all the “Buckle Your Pants” reviews on Steam - it made me feel that that was an over-used joke as a result.)\n\nOhhhhh, but Stamper’s role in the game is not just that. Oh no. His main role in the game is as the voice of the Narrator, who tells the story and also acts as commentator in each of the games levels, giving (occasionally snarky) remarks whenever you die, or collect gems, or yarns, or…a whole bunch of stuff.\n\nOverall, this game is stunningly brilliant for such an indie development studio, I’d really recommend getting it if you can.\n\nWhen to buy: Worth full price definitely, highest it's been discounted is 90% off (though not recently).\n\n9/10 + 2 bonus points for post-beta freebie and Will Stamper = 11/10\n\n========================================================\n\nI hereby concluded the review on June 20, 2014, the start of the Steam Summer Sale, and by then I had already made enough funds from selling prisoner heads and immediately blow it on Castle Crashers. Now THAT is awesome.","April 3, 2014","true","79.6"," 105 of 147 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","105","147","0","0"

While it would have been easy to simply rig up a basic menu and some customisation options to string all the levels together, The Behemoth has carefully crafted an outrageously humorous and addicting experience that will keep us entertained its next project is unleashed on the world.It’s not only surprising that BattleBlock Theater has a story that is more than an intro cutscene, but it’s surprising just how funny it manages to be at the same time. It's juvenile, but it's funny.The game's story follows Hatty Hattington who is shipwrecked on a mysterious island with hundreds of his close friends. Hatty is then taken captive by the island’s feline natives, and brainwashed to become their leader as his friends are forced to participate in deadly theater performances.This rather bizarre setup paves way for the hundreds of levels, which make up the majority of the game. Each level plays out on a theater stage, with catlike silhouettes creeping in the foreground, standing in for a ‘virtual’ audience.It’s ironic given how creative the setup is that the actual gameplay is simple, but what BattleBlock Theater might lack in novel mechanics and flashy gameplay is made up for with tight controls and excellent level design. Every level is laid out on what is essentially a grid, with various block types making up the floors and walls you maneuver your little avatar on.However, levels aren’t as simple as racing towards a finish line or taking out a certain number of enemies.Weapons, along with a standard repertoire of punches and kicks, can be used to defeat enemies, but to be honest, the fighting system never felt as tight as the platforming did.BattleBlock Theater wouldn’t feel right if you weren’t able to tackle the game with a friend by your side, and The Behemoth hasn’t forgotten its Castle Crashers roots. Playing the campaign solo works perfectly fine, but BattleBlock was designed with co-op in mind, and it shows.BattleBlock Theater feels like it was designed for the child that still lives inside me. It’s juvenile, colourful, and silly. But more importantly, it achieves everything it set out to do, with a near masterful level of execution. The addictive multiplayer and excellent level creation tools are just the icing on the cake.","December 12, 2014","true","15.5"," 37 of 41 people (90%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","90","37","41","4","0"

All the while, Hatty Hattington watches on from the vault behind the gift shop. Boy, he's not moving much. But I'm sure he's fine! You'd better go rescue him, though! He doesn't look like he's taking this predicament very well.\n\nIn the main story mode, there are 8 chapters, each with 9 normal stages, a 2-part finale, and 3 encore stages. In the normal stages, you must find at least three green gems and reach the exit in time. Each one you complete unlocks the next one, and the final one unlocks the finale. In the finale, you're racing against the clock. You still need three gems in the first part, though I'm not positive about the second. May as well collect them, just to be sure! You have to do these two stages back-to-back, you can't select one individually. Which is a little annoying when you've only missed the A++ grade on one of them, and aren't positive you even got it until after you've finished both and checked. The encores are all unlocked at the same time after the finale is completed. These are basically timed, more challenging normal stages, and are completely optional. But, you know. Do 'em.\n\nAt heart, BattleBlock is a solid platformer. Beyond solid. The level design in this is pretty rather darn expert-tier, and there's enough variety to it that you won't get bored before the end. I mean, you've got your typical platformer fare. Ice floors and spikes and water you can't touch for... some reason. But then you have weird rideable squarish pig things, cats that breathe in really hard to pull you towards the hazards near them, these magmatic blocks that launch you off when you so much as lightly brush them, and some sort of... duck... shark... Yoshi's Island-lookin' guys that help you onto ledges and also poop you at things!\n\nIt's also got the one thing that no other platformer that I've ever played has, and that's Stamper! I don't know if I can adequately describe this to you, but where the exceptional gameplay and endearing visual style make this a great game, Stamper's narration then makes it phenomenal. Every silly line is spouted in the perfect way to get the most comedic mileage out of it. I mean, the lines are already pretty amusingly written, but man, that voice, that energy... of all the best friends in this game, the narrator may as well be your bestest friend of all! He's right there with you, every step of the way. Advancing the plot, chatting with you as you play, commenting on and reacting to the situations at hand. We're talking Bastion levels of unforgettable narration, right here.\n\nSo, what else.\n\nThere are plenty of other modes besides just rolling through the basic story mode by yourself. There's also an insane mode which forces you to start the entire level if you die even once! Did I mention there's an achievement in it, for you? There's also a co-op story. That also has an insane mode, in case there's anybody left in your life that you don't completely hate, yet (Stamper notwithstanding)! There's also an arena, which has eight different gametypes, including a fun sort of basketball game, a race to finish a level first, one where you have to rub up on all the tiles to change them to your team's color (my personal favorite),  and of course just plain ol' beating the crap out of each other!\n\nYou can, of course, play community-built stages, as well, in single player, co-op, AND arena varieties. These don't get you gems (the currency for unlocking new prisoners) or yarn (the currency for unlocking new weapons) unless they're featured, but they'll help ease the shakes you'll get when you're jonesing for a BattleBlock fix.\n\nAlso, got a few bombs of knowledge I should drop, here. First, there's a new Furbottom's Feature every Friday. Every other week, it's a new arena playlist. On the non-arena weeks, it alternates between a set of single player levels, and a set of co-op levels. You can be notified whenever there's a new feature by subscribing to this BattleBlock Steam community subforum. Also, every so often special prisoner heads are released for a limited time, and can be collected either by simply booting the game, or by completing a current feature. I check in on this guide this guide every so often to see if there's one up. If you don't care about prisoner heads and just want to have fun, ignore all this garbage and go about your life, unburned by the hellish draw of completionism!\n\nBattleBlock's difficulty is fair, and has a good learning curve. The music is all pretty groovy and gives you something easily worth listening to as you step on that obvious trap and die like an idiot.\n\nI mean succeed wildly and without error.\n\nAlright, I hope that's everything because I've got stuff to do. So, uh, buy BattleBlock Theater! Enjoy it! It will enjoy you back!","January 7, 2015","true","42.5"," 26 of 30 people (87%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","87","26","30","12","0"

The controls are super responsive, the game is challenging without being punishing and provides a ton of laughs with the narration and other sight gags packed in.\n\nThis game's great!

The perfect platformer. And let me tell you why.\n\nThe art style is perfect, as usually. Way more improved then Castle Crashers one, so a better thing on an awesome thing its a "uber-awesome thing", right?  Dan Paladin Ladies and gentlemen.\n\nThe controls are superbe: you can totally feel the character in your hand, and you will move it in the way you want it to. Of course, if you don't own a controller, well, that can be a problem, since the keyboard mapping its not much confortable.\n\nThe music its glorious: I could stand 5 minute in the title screen just to listen to that sick tunes. Each level haves randomized songs, except the boss section and the finale. Add these songs are great, but sadly you will hear them a lot, so it might get a little annoying after a while.\n\nThe narrator is Stamper. If you know his works, there is no need to add anything else about this section. His voice can cure tumors. (But not cancer, for that you need to call Kevan Brighting)\n\nThe game itself its just grand; you'll find 8 chapters, each one haves 9 levels and a boss section + 3 encore levels. They go to easy to hard really smoothly and never feels unfair to you. Well, if you don't count ONE encore level.\nYes, I'm talking about the last Encore level. That was probably the most unfair thing I've played in my life. If you're willing to complete it, God helps you. Still, it's an optional level, fortunatly, so it doesen't remove point to the final score.\n\nI really don't know what to say about the story, just because there isn't much to say about it without spoiling it, so I leave you that to find out by yourself.\n\nHowever, there is a problem with this game: Furbottom's Feature community maps. Each Friday the Devs pick up one community map pack and upload it so the whole community can play it to get a special prisoner-head (decorative misc). So, what's the problem with this you may ask? 50% of the time they seems to just pick a random map pack, giving us some unfair, terrible, painful levels to complete just for complete the heads collection. I really wish they could check first what are they gonna publish before doing it.\n\nFinal score: 9.5/10\n\nYou can get it for a cheap price pretty much each big steam sales, or just buy it full price, it totally deserves it.","July 6, 2014","true","107.8"," 26 of 31 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","26","31","0","1"

This game is about a bunch of people with you which sadly you dont have a name (unless you check your invneotry to see what your characters name is and inside details). If you didnt know already but this indie game company made 2 other games, Alien Hominid (which is supprisingly on the Nintendo Gamecube and Gameboy Advance), and Castle Crashers. Both of those games were great but you guys might be wondering "what does those 2 games have to do with Battleblock Theater?" well ill get to it so shut up and drink your cup of water. This game has many refrencesfrom those 2 games like unlockable characters and even hidden backgrounds from those 2 games.\nAhm so as i was typing (logic), You take on the role of a prisioner which is forced to play daredeveling levels at a certain time and collecting gems, the currency of this game. You also find yarn which can be used to buy weapons to either help you or kill a cat who are the guards in an abandoned theater which is currently the biggest theater in the world since it takes 1 entire island to make. The gems are used to buy prisioners, yes, you have to buy your friends and the more you buy the bigger the price is, total logic everyone.\nThe multiplayer is acutally quite fun since arena mode has up to 12 modes to play on and you can even play story mode but with only 2 people.\nFYI if you were a beta tester for this game, you literally got this game from 15 bucks to free since its already stuck in your steam library.\nThere is a level editor which by the name you can make levels and share them on Steam Workshop. I hope everyone enjoys making levels and sharing them.\nif you remember Insane mode from Castle Crashers well guess what, theres one in this game but you can play it whenever you want (phew) the only catch is theres no checkpoint which is really helpful.\nThe acvhivements in this game are actually harder to get than from Castle Crashers, 1 of them requires luck and that is to play with someone from The Behemoth or someone who has the achivement (i got it already during beta).\nI give this game 10 out of 10 since this game is already good the way it is, lots of modes to play online with, show off all your prisioners/weapons and barelly any lag from this game. I'm suprised i didnt lag during the beta cause most people were suppose to and i was using a bad laptop","May 4, 2014","true","163.6"," 23 of 31 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","23","31","0","1"

Even on normal difficulty did I find myself rage quitting multiple times. Most of the people buying this are buying it because of Aleks and James, I figured so if you are then you know what I mean.\n\nThe story line is pretty strange but the story is pretty hilarious. In fact the entire game is just comedy. Don't let that fool you though; it looks like a silly and simple game but it is pretty complex. There's puzzles to solve and certain paths to take that will take you to either the exit or right back to where you started from. Paying attention is crucial in game play.\n\nCustomization is fun; there's a lot of strange masks to get and colors to choose for your team. It seems pretty simple because it is--through the levels you collect gems and yarn. Gems are for buying new heads, and yarn is for buying new weapons. Which brings me to the fact that there are a lot of weapons in this game: good for killing enemies or your teammate. (Or yourself on accident.)\n\nIn short, if you enjoy playformers, puzzles, cats, stupid puns and challenges, you'll love this game.","June 1, 2014","true","50.6"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","17","22","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nightingaleella/recommended/238460/","Nightingaleella","ArtistNightingale","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nightingaleella/","7 products in account","Product received for free\n\nIt's about time I reviewed this one.\nBattleBlock Theater is one of the best platformers I've played in recent memory, and considering my background with Nintendo games, that's saying something. The Behemoth's (known for their previous game Castle Crashers) trademark style really comes through here, with it's quirky humor, simple yet aggrivating level design, and a surprisingly emotional and depressing ending. It's an experience you won't soon forget.\n\nThe story follows you, a friend of Hatty Hattington (the best friend of all) after you, Hatty, and all of your other friends are shipwrecked on a mysterious island. You attempt to take shelter in a suposedly abandoned theater, only to see Hatty kidnapped by a bunch of giant cats, forced to wear an old top hat. You (and the rest of your friends, who serve as extra character skins that you can later unlock) are then taken in as prisoner, forced to "act" in deadly performances, while Hatty runs the whole thing. The object of the game is to complete eight chapters (seven of which are supposedly shows, while the last one is a vault that leads to Hatty's office) and rescue your friend.\n\nSo at face value, the story follows the typical damsel in distress needing to be rescued (though it's not nearly as blatant here as it was in Castle Crashers), though there's much, much more to it than that. The cutscenes that take place after each chapter in the game are all voiced by Will Stamper and Will Stamper alone, with an adorable "puppet show" motif in the visuals. These cutscenes all deliver what you would expect from Stamper: a hilarious yet mildly immature animation that knows how to use it's voice actor to his fullest. That being said, Stamper does give a very heartfelt and touching performance in the final cutscene, where Hatty is revealed to be more or less a vegetable by the time you save him. There is also the famous "Secret Song," which Stamper does entirely in scat, and the results are nothing short of amazing.\n\nAs far as the actual gameplay goes, it's a platformer with all the standard tropes. You got your powerups, enemies, environmental hazards, currency, weapons, checkpoints, and secret areas. The only truly unique thing that BattleBlock Theater offers in it's standard gamplay is the fact that you need at least three gems (the ingame currency) in order to pass each level. This is very easy to do very on, but towards the middle-end of the game this can become difficult to do. However, that doesn't make the gameplay bland, though. The game is very well paced and has only one very mild difficulty spike (not counting the final chapter, which is supposed to be insane and test your limits) that will only trip you up for a while, but you'll adjust pretty quickly.\n\nThe game also has an "arena mode" which allows you to play one of twelve different competitve games against either the computer, friends locally, or anyone online (if you are lucky enough to have someone join you in the mode you want to play). All of these are extremely fun with the right people and are best played locally, but they can become very boring against the CPU or someone you don't know online.\n\nAll and all, this game is a gem and HIGHLY recommended for those of you who want a platformer that isn't excessively hard or mind numbingly easy. It's the perfect balance of both with a lovable narrator and commedy straight out of early YouTube and Newgrounds to boot.\n\n9/10","May 11","true","43.2"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","12","13","0","0"

The premise is that you're shipwrecked on an island inhabited by cats who are forcing you to 'act' your way through life-threatening stages for their entertainment. Along the way, you can set your friends free with the in-game currency, gems, as well buying cool new weapons by bribing the guards (who are cats, of course) with yarn. All of this is accompanied by hilarious commentary which has been specifically designed to leave you in stitches. All of this can be done with a friend, either local or online. If you want to be a bit more competitive, there's even an Arena mode which allows you to compete with up to three other people in ridiculous challenges such as capturing horses or collecting gold. This game also covers the community connoisseurs with a cornucopia of community-made challenges on the Steam Workshop. Overall, this game is worth it for the comedy and even more worth it for the gameplay.","November 17, 2014","true","25.2"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

The game itself I bought a while back for retail and at that price it is entirely justified as it is a really fun game and even better when playing with a friend. The game consists of several platorms to jump with each level getting progressively harder. The game to some may seem a tad repetitive and those views are completed justified as each level just consists with you getting from point a to point b but each level gets mopre complex and fun and it also contains jewels and balls of yarn which are used for multiple things.\n\nThe jewels are used to buy new characters (I say new characters but it really is new faces for your character... still really good though :D) and the balls of yarn are used to buy new weapons. This collecting element makes the game more fun as you don't have to collect evey jewel or ball of yarn they are just in it to make your gaming experience more enjoyable.\n\nThe presentation is very close to that of castle crashers (Made by the same company) and  it really fits what the game is going for.\n\nThe gameplay is very fun as it sees you jump between platforms using weapons and either chosing to help your friend or letting him fail while laughing maniacally. The controls are great very tight, however I'd highly recommend a controller as the keyboard can be used but is no where near as good as a controller (The keyboard does work very well by no means a bad port controller but the controller is better).\n\nThe sounds of this game from the music all the way to the narrator were superb. The music was grat to listen to while playing the game and didn't get boring. The narrator has a hillarious voice and very funny lines, he is on youtube and has voiced a few animations online; also his name is stamper.\n\nMy verdict of this game is that it is a very fun game to play with a friend however they didn't implement a feature that allows you to play with 3 friends during the main story which imo this game could have really benefited from. That was my only gripe with this game as everything else about it was fantastic. I'd give this game a 9.5/10 for very fun gameplay and funny moments while also being a very reasonable price of £10.99 (as of november 2014). It gets taken down a bit though for only having the ability of 2 player story when they could have easly made 4 player.","November 20, 2014","true","6.9"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

The game plays like a 2D puzzle platformer, but the story and narrator will keep you laughing until your sides hurt. You can make the experience even more enjoyable with a friend.\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory:  “Oh no! the Cats have captured Hatty Hattington and are holding him hostage! Hold on Hatty, we’re coming for ya! …It would be nice if you could meet us half way, or something…” You are a prisoner-slash-performer *cough* who is trying to save “Hatty Hattington, the friendliest guy of all, he’s the friend of friends, and a real stylish gentleman too”.\nI don’t want to give anything away on this story; it was witty, hilarious, and absolutely awesome. It’s worth playing through several times just to watch the cinematic’s again. The animation is hilarious and downright brilliant. These are the same people that brought you Castle Crashers, so if you enjoyed that game, this one is ten times better.\n\nGame Play: The game is a 2D platformer, usually the word “platformer” is a swear word to me. However this platformer gives you a little bit of slack with various accessories that help you complete levels (if you’re creative). The controls are tight, the puzzles change for multi-player so you’re not simply just playing single player with another person, and there’s many features for player-made-custom maps and even battle modes.\n\nAchievements: I haven’t finished getting all the achievements for this game, but most of them just took care of themselves while I played the game. Thankfully there *isn’t* an achievement for getting “perfect on each level”. There are achievements for both single player and Co-op, so you might want to make a friend or have a friend help you out as you play through this game.\n\nPrice: The price for Battle Block Theater is $14.99, I received this game as a gift from someone thankfully it was on sale, but with all the laughter we had playing the game, and considering I’ve put 20 hours into the game so far (that number will most likely increase) the price is quite fair for the entertainment, but as always I recommend waiting for the game to go on sale.\n\nConclusion: Why are you still reading my review? You should totally be playing this game. I cannot say all the amazing things about the game; it’s easier to say what’s not good about this game: Nothing I can think of. I highly recommend this game to anyone hard-core gaming or soft-core.","September 22, 2014","true","25.8"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/arborday/recommended/238460/","arborday","arbor day","http://steamcommunity.com/id/arborday/","595 products in account","Now that Battleblock Theater is out of beta, early access, and the embargo is lifted, I can finally talk about how much I love it.\n\nThe most obvious thing is Dan Paladin's art, which I always love. He has this simple but unique style that I never get sick of. A lot of his art manages to be a bit cute, without pushing things to a place that its so over the top that you want to vomit. Even getting killed manages to look adorable sometimes.\n\nThe platforming here, which is the main draw of the game, is stellar. The levels may look simple at first glance, but as you play they will introduce many new blocks with their own mechanics, and drastically ramp up in challenge. The game has enemies as well, but they serve more to hinder your platforming progress than to actually act as a barrier to gameplay. This is more true in single player, where the game is about trying to clear each level with a high grade so you can unlock more content. In multiplayer, you can play on teams and try to disrupt the others by punching, shoving, or any other means. You can also do this to your team mate, if you need to.\n\nSpeaking of content unlocks, you can unlock and trade a few weapons, each that act vastly different. Some have uses that aren't apparent at first glance. For example, there is a force ball that shoots a ball of energy out in front of you, that quickly arcs upward. If you shoot it next to a wall, you can jump on top of it on the rebound and launch yourself into the air. There are also many different heads to unlock. Each head and weapon is added to your Steam inventory, and they even have the option to market them if you want.\n\nSpeaking of teams, the game has a lot of team based mechanics as well to help keep multiplayer interesting. If a ledge is too high, you can hang your arm over the side and offer an assist. You can jump off the head of a drowning player if you're quick enough, and escape his fate. There's also a button to make your character scream for help, if your partner isn't paying attention and leaves you stuck somewhere. The game lacks any real type of chat system otherwise, but honestly things get so crazy that you wouldn't have the time to type out messages during a match.\n\nThe game has a level editor, and it's pretty powerful. Not only do you have access to all the various blocks, enemies, and what not, but you can change the size of the level a bit, to get things just right. It even has built in tools to help with things like building a level that is mirrored, either vertically or horizontally, as well as a 4 way split. This is a really nice addition that many developers would have over looked.\n\nThe sound and music is fine, with the voicework standing out. Not only is the story unique and often hilarious, but it is well done as well.\n\nIf I had to come up with a complaint, it would be that sometimes the control is a bit touchy. An example that comes to mind is trying to jump on the edge of blocks. There is a spike block that kills you if you land on it. If you manage to jump on the exact edge of the block, you won't trigger the trap. The room for error, if there even is any, is so minute that this can't be done in a reliable manner as to use this as a point in your level building without becoming overly annoying to players.\n\nOther than that small complaint, the game is another great entry from Behemoth, which is pretty standard stuff for their releases.\n\nIf you like platforming, with more focus on the actual platforming challenges than on enemies and such, I can't recommend this enough. If you're expecting something deeper, like a Castlevania or Megaman, you might want to pass.\n\nAs a side note, I'd like to add that Behemoth gave the full game to it's beta testers for free, which was a really cool thing that they didn't have to do at all. <3","May 16, 2014","true","10.4"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

The truth is: it's nothing like any of those games. It's nothing like anything made ever in ever forever. It's an completely fresh and utterly unique platformer with colourful graphics and an absurd story-line.\n\nMost of the fun comes with finding out and trying to deal with how bonkers this game actually is... You play as what I can only guess are doodles of humans who shipwrecked onto a mysterious island. The captain of the ship, Hatty Hattington, is possessed by a magical top hat he is forced to wear by the humanoid ginger cats who inhabit the island's creepy run-down theater. If you're having trouble grasping this, then you are not alone. These humanoid cats, or at least the security-worker cats, name you and all other crew members of your ship their prisoners and force you to entertain the civilian population of the island, who are also cats.\n\nThe humour had me laughing the whole time, and I played for thirteen hours. I'm not even anywhere near completing even the main story-line; the game has so many levels and only sometimes gets repetitive, even despite it's simple premise. On the rare occasion it does get redundant it throws in another mechanic or unlocks another weapon and the fun returns. The story-line is only two player, but there are some sports-styled games for four of you to anger each other over. Oh and Stamper as the narrator: Genius.\n\nThere is just so much here in one tiny package. Good old simplistic platformer gameplay, colourful goofy graphics, tons of levels and collectibles, make-your-own-level content creator, huge replay value even if you aren't a completionist, funky soundtrack and everything about it is hilarious and entertaining throughout.\n\nThis game is good to buy!","August 9, 2014","true","13.7"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

There's SO much to do in it, like play the story mode, collect the prisioner heads, play arena mode, co-op, and much more.\n\nMy only gripe: There's no real incentive to not die. Once you collect a gem or yarn, it's yours to keep. So if you kamikaze at a really tricky collectible, you're free to die and keep it. It's not very challenging (although I have yet to play it on insane mode...), but it's still worth it. Although to be fair you do drop the occasional Golden Hat upon dying, and if you're above water, say bye bye to that hat of gold.

An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game.\n\nOne Hour Reviews - Game 21\nBattleBlock Theater\nPurchase Date: 12/29/2014\n\nI was already familar with The Behemoth having played Castle Crashers in the past.  So when I saw this for 90% off during the Winter Sale of 2014, I couldn't resist picking it up, even if it did take me 7 months to finally get around to playing it.\n\nBattleblock does have a few things in common with Castle Crashers, such as the same art style, and the same quirky humor.  But Battleblock is in other respects a much different game, with it's focus on platform gameplay mixed in with some puzzle solving.\n\nThe story, such as it is, has you crashing your ship full of friends ("friendship", get it), on an island where you become a prisoner to a bunch of cat guards.  Inside the prison you enter a series of theatres.  Each theatre is a level that you have to escape from, to the entertainment of your guards who are all watching.\n\nI appreciated that the levels did not start out overly difficult.  Instead the game becomes more progressively difficult to give you time to pick up the basics of gameplay, which are easy to understand.  Each level has an exit which is unlocked once you gather 3 gems.  But most levels have additional gems that you can get as well.  Many levels also have a bonus ball of yarn that you can collect.  When you exit a level, you get a letter grade based on the number of gems and yarn collected, as well as how long you took to beat the level.  So the game definitely encourages replay.  Also, the gems and yarn you collect can be spent on upgrades like new characters and weapons.\n\nI love that the game comes with it's own level editor, but I did not actually check it out in the time I played.  In fact, it felt like my hour really flew by as I kept making my way through various levels.  I can see myself spending a lot of time in this game.  This was so worth the $1.49 I spent on it, but honestly even at full price it's still worth checking out.","July 18, 2015","true","0.9"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","0"

It can be played both competitively and casually and has a wide array of additional content other than the main storyline to keep you entertained. This game has a really good sense of humor and the levels all feel entertaining and unique. Also with the addition of the workshop it means that you can download even more levels offline which means limitless fun. If I have one main problem with this game it would be the combat. Don't get me wrong the combat isn't horrible but at the same time I feel it could have been a lot better.

An exciting theater where everything is run by cats and nothing could go wrong! That's what Furbottom, the theater's owner, said before he died in an horribly hilarious accident. The hat of Furbottom is the only thing left to remember him... but then the hat starts to glow. The cats look for a new owner, and they quickly find one! They put the hat on him, but then he starts the change. His eyes start to water and his hat glows more brightly in a vicious red color. He starts to float, and he turns into a total bummer. Sadly, he died too. This repeated over and over again. The cats found an owner, the owner did weird things, then he either died or somehow managed to escape. This had gone on for days, and then the days turned into months, and the months turned into years. When would the cats find a permanent owner?\n\nShortly after their latest owner's death, a man by the name of Hatty Hattington was with his friends on their ship. They crashlanded on an island, which unfortunately for them was the island that BattleBlock Theater had been sitting on all those years. When all the friends woke up, they realized Hatty had been stolen! They rushed inside the theater to search for him. They hear noises and see strange figures that keep running away. Then, suddenly, the see Hatty being held down by two cats! The cats put the magic hat on him, and his eyes begin to water and he begins to float. The cats then attack all of Hatty's friends, and they have no weapons to defend themselves!\n\nAfter a long while, they all wake up from the battle. They're all seperated and one cat walks up to a cage. The cat unlocks the cage and pulls the prisoner out. The prisoner is pushed into a room with tons of spikes, sawblades, and other cliche death items! Now, all the prisoner can do is preform in this big death trap in order to escape the theater!\n\nYOU are that prisoner! You must battle your way through all those countless, seemingly impossible death traps, arena matches, and hilarious cutscenes to rescue Hatty, save all your other friends, and get the heck out of there! So buckle your pants because you're about to experience the ride of a lifetime! Woooooo-hoooooooo!!!","April 4","true","395.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dirtbagdressing/recommended/238460/","dirtbagdressing","Dirtbag","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dirtbagdressing/","27 products in account","Bro, this game, bro. This game, this is it.\n\nFirst it's an XBOX Exclusive, and now it's on PC. Out of nowhere. What a dream!\n\nAnyway, this game; it's BattleBlock Theater; it features one of the whackiest stories of all time. But this game isn't all about that, of course not! The story has a deeper meaning to it. Seriously, there's A WHALE IN THE STORY. YOU HAVE TO KNOW THE STORY IS GOOD IF THERE IS A WHALE IN IT.\nOn a more serious note, the story, again; whacky, fun, and still deep at the same time. Now I'm not gonna go and spoil it - that's for you to find out when you buy the game! Well, *if* you happened to buy this game. But really, who wouldn't? I mean, this game attracted me with its awesome humor and showcasing of simplicity in its own gameplay - which brings me to my next case.\n\nThe gameplay; ultra super important in a game, obviously. The gameplay is simple. Platformer physics and platformer ideas along with requirements of a strategizing mind - also a hint of combat for your desire. Good balance, right? Yep! That's what's good in this game. It features a way to unlock new weapons and tools to serve the odds in your favor of getting past combat. The puzzles included in this game require, as said before, a mind that can locate a good way to solve that puzzle in the form of an obstacle or simple combat. Every aspect of certain puzzles is important to the overall gameplay in the game itself.\nThe progression of difficulty is shown in this game very well. As you progress through the game, the difficulty increases with harder obstacles and such. It gets bigger. Harder. That's what sh- nevermind.\n\nThe game encourages you to do better and manage the puzzles and obstacles put into the game, which make for a good gameplay and difficulty in the balance of clever design. Really, the puzzles are almost godly. They're very creative and I can understand every single one of them.\n\nThere's also arena with many game modes to choose from. I'm not going to go in depth with each indiviual one, but let me say that these game modes are very good and the creators have done it the right way. Arena mode encourages competitive gameplay in contrast to the teamwork (or traitorous acts) of story mode co-op.\n\nThere's also a level editor that allows you to make your own playlists or arena levels. It has everything, and you can do as you wish on it.\n\nThe music in this game is catchy. It gets stuck in your head, but in a good way. I really love the music in this game. It really satisfies and motivates me to get past a level. I love the choice of music and how it fits the levels. It just never gets old.\nThe art in this game is what you can probably expect from an indie game. It's clean, cartoon-ish, but in a good way. The art is very nice and reveals a depth of the story. It's up to par and it's very nice.\n\nOn the other hand, I've praised this game's progression of difficulty, as said above. However, the difficulty is a bit steep compared to encores and required levels. I see that the encores are optional challenges, but for the chapter they're on, it might be easier to backtrack compared to finishing encores right off the bat.\n\nIn conclusion: This game has everything. Parkour, combat, puzzles, competitive gameplay, and some more. I would give this game a steady 9.3333333/10. This game has a very awesome gameplay and a variety of them. This game has great elements, but some could also be improved. (Like the ♥♥♥♥ING ENCORE LEVELS AAAHH) But seriously, this game is really good. Go get it, and keep shining on, Behemoth!","May 20, 2014","true","42.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","4"

It crashed against the shore of a nearby island, and the survivors soon found themselves imprisoned by a race of giant cats that made their prisoners battle for their lives in a dilapidated theater. Meanwhile, Hatty watched in silence, sitting in a chair with a malevolently glowing top hat resting on his head\n\nThe story in BattleBlock Theater isn't especially memorable once you put aside the creepy imagery of homicidal cat people. What really sells the tale is the energetic narrator, who tears through one line after another of cheesy exposition littered with enough poop jokes to fill an adult diaper. Hopefully, you don't mind that sort of juvenile humor, or you're at least willing to look past it so that you can enjoy what is easily one of the most satisfying downloadable titles to arrive on the Xbox Live Arcade.\n\nIf you've been playing 2D action platformers for years, one of the aspects you'll appreciate most about BattleBlock Theater is its refusal to hold your hand unnecessarily. The interface and objectives are designed to communicate their purpose clearly, so a tutorial is neither needed nor provided. All that you must do to win the game is reach your friend, which you do by clearing one portion of the theater after another. As you work toward that end, you explore more than 100 carefully constructed stages that put your platforming and puzzle-solving skills to the test.\n\nAs each stage begins, you jump out of a cage that is positioned somewhere within an arena. Your specific goal is to pass through a glowing exit gate, but first you must collect a number of emeralds that are located somewhere in the vicinity. Collecting three of them is enough to do the job, but you can also gather additional ones to use as currency at theater gift shops. An oversized ball of yarn is also stashed in each zone--usually in a fiendishly clever place--and there are sometimes bonus stages that are hidden behind portions of the landscape in out-of-the-way places. Though you don't always work against a timer, you still want to hurry because completion time and any optional items gathered both count toward the letter grade that you are awarded upon completing a stage.\n\nYou encounter new hazards and more demanding situations as you advance. Figuring everything out usually takes only a moment, and then negotiating the additional obstacles becomes second nature until you're faced with a particularly devious area and find yourself pausing to ponder the best course of action. Such moments come up quite often, since BattleBlock Theater can be quite the difficult game. By the time you're partway through the sixth chapter, you're wall jumping, dashing, sliding, and double jumping like a champion, and you still might not be able to avoid the buzzsaw blades, spike traps, and grenade-launching cats thrown your way.\n\nFortunately, the normal difficulty setting includes a generous checkpoint system that prevents you from ever losing much ground. You can try your luck at some of the more challenging gauntlets a few times over the course of a minute, until you get everything right, and the feeling when you come out the other end is exhilarating. If you prefer a less forgiving system, try insane mode. It doesn't play a lot differently than its standard counterpart--until you die. Then, you have to collect all those gems and that pesky yarn ball all over again because there was no checkpoint to catch you when you fell. Considering how crazy things get by the end of the adventure, you'll likely be doing yourself a favor if you start with the easier default setting.\n\nAlthough the charismatic narrator and the thrill of each new stage are ample incentive to advance toward the closing credits, the developers also included a bunch of unlockable content that lets you personalize your experience. In addition to a variety of special attacks that include vacuum cleaners and exploding paper airplanes, you can choose from one of four head types for your character. That's a nice touch since the head makes up about half of the hero's body mass. Most of the available options are wonderfully zany; there's simple pleasure in watching a ragdoll with a giant, triangular head and curlers leap around an arena while launching fireballs and narrowly avoiding homing missiles fired by oversized robots.\n\nPersonalized characters make sense in BattleBlock Theater, especially because the game features a robust selection of multiplayer modes. There are eight distinct events that place you in similar arenas with unique objectives. In one mode, you attack your foe to knock his soul loose so that you can carry it, while you avoid letting him do the same thing to you. The longer you possess your adversary's spirit, the more points you accrue. In another attraction, you must tag more blocks than your opponent does within the provided time limit. There's also a mode where you grab a ball and score hoops on your opponent's goal, while in yet another selection, you ride your rival's steed back to your goal to score points. You can also work with possible allies to complete stages, and even take a break from the action to trade collectibles with friends.\n\nMultiplayer modes allow as many as four people to participate at once either locally or online, but it's also possible to interact with other players less directly. The game includes an intuitive level editor. A tutorial is included, but you'll barely even need it if you've already played through the game. You select dimensions for your desired arena, then place blocks and objectives as you see fit. Once you create a "playlist" that contains three stages, you can upload your creation and other players may vote it up or down. Your creation could even be featured as a top-rated community selection if enough people like what you've done. Though there aren't as many creation and sharing options as you'd find in something like Little Big Planet, the tools could keep you and others entertained for hours.\n\nEven if you find BattleBlock Theater too challenging after the initial stages, you'll want to keep playing just so you can see where the story goes next, or because you're every bit as addicted to the platforming action as expert players are. There's no shortage of ways to play, whether that be alone, cooperatively, or competitively, and the capable level editor is the icing on the cake. Hatty Hattington and his friends may be living through an absolute nightmare, but you're bound to be so thoroughly entertained that you won't have time to empathize.\n\nThe Good\nHilarious narration\nChallenging, freewheeling platforming\nExtensive multiplayer options enhance the nuttiness\nIntuitive content creation\nLots of great, expertly crafted levels\n\nThe Bad\nJuvenile humor can occasionally grate\n\n8.5\nGreat\n\n","May 16","true","2.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/emperorgandhi/recommended/238460/","emperorgandhi","[CotC] King Conga Gandhi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/emperorgandhi/","194 products in account",""Pants buckling intensifies"\n\n\nBattleBlock Theater was created by popular indie dev The Behemoth, known for two of some of the greatest indie titles pre-indie game era: Castle Crashers and Alien Hominid. Now, after quite a wait, the third popular title of The Behemoth's games is released, but does it live up to expectations? Yes, but not by much.\n\nGraphics\nI'll start with visuals. It honestly isn't much different from Alien Hominid and Castle Crashers, but I still do like the simple style of the game. Oh yes, and it does have the "1,000,000,000p graphics with high resolution super texture technology that modern human eyeballs can't even see." Trust me, that narrator does NOT lie. The graphics in this game make my eyeballs melt at times. It's so simple that I can't see the amazing hyper realistic textures this game has!\n\nGameplay\nNow, I'll move to the gameplay that includes the "state of the art ragdoll physics." Sorry to doubt you Mr. Narrator, but there isn't much ragdoll from what I've seen. Is there "particle physic future systems?" Yes. The gameplay is simple, if a bit dull. The combat is somewhat clunky and can be annoying when playing PvP. Not much to this platformer, especially from Behemoth.\n\nStory\nStory time? I believe that would be a yes. The story, believe it or not, is humorous and pretty enjoyable. I'll try and not say much, but I'll explain the main plot: Your best friend, Hatty Hattington, you, and other friends go on a trip on the S.S. Friendship, but get shipwrecked on a mysterious island run by cats. Yes, cats. They give Hatty a corrupt top hat that makes him betray his friends and make him the leader of the cats. Especially when you add the humorous narrator that is quite underrated, great story overall.\n\nAudio\nNow we move to the audio. Okay, there isn't much to the audio, but the narration is very humorous and well done, despite not getting much praise compared to The Stanley Parable and Bastion's narrators. The music is above average, and uses choir in some rather creative ways. Oh yeah, and there's people make sounds when you do stuff. "11/10 its okay" -IGN\n\nReplayability\nFinally, we hit the replayability. Honestly, there isn't much to do that I saw post game, although I did enjoy making some levels. PvP, like I said, has clunky controls, Insane Mode doesn't seem as fun as it was in Castle Crashers, and that's about it. You could get a couple hours into the game, but I wouldn't expect too much.\n\nVerdict\nOverall, BattleBlock Theater meets expectations, but not by much. It did need some work in some very important areas, but was successful with the narrator's humor and large amount of content. I would buy this at about half off and say it was well worth it, so I would wait for a sale to get this game. However, it still is a game you shouldn't try to miss.\n\nGraphics- 7/10\nGameplay- 6/10\nStory- 8.5/10\nAudio- 8.5/10\nReplayability- 6/10\n\n.:7.2/10:.\n+Awesome narrator\n+Lots of content\n+Great story\n+Lots of creative songs\n-Clunky combat\n-Not much to do post game, depsite all the content\n-Dull overall gameplay","May 29, 2014","true","13.0"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Play alone or online or with your friend sitting next to you, in any form, the game is extremely fun and never stops leaving a grin on my face.

There is a never ending supply of user made content through the Steam-workshop, as well as a hard mode included for the main story too.\n\nOne of the most attractive features about BattleBlock Theater is that you can play local Co-Op, a feature that these games often skip over.\n\nI absolutely loved the cinematic in between each stage as well, the dialog had me in stitches the whole time.\n\nI wouldn't recommend doing what I did and powering through this game in 2 sessions as you will end up wanting to scream the walls down, but you should definitely pick this game up, even when it's not on sale its a huge bargain for the amount of content and giggles you will get out of it.\n\nMore Reviews at - http://completingthebacklog.blogspot.co.uk/","August 24, 2014","true","7.3"," 15 of 25 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","15","25","0","0"

But I just had a co-op game with a relative of mine, and what I played was enough to clinch a recommendation out of me.\n\nThis is Super Meat Boy lite - much smaller levels, much scaled back in terms of difficulty and without uber-hardcore gymnastic moves you have to pull to pass the levels (except for the ♥♥♥♥ing double-jump. Grrrrr.).\n\nUsually when a game goes "It's like (insert game name here), but easier!", it usually ends up playing like a damp squib, like a pat on the back and a reassurance that you are totally good at video games! Not so with Battleblock Theater. It has smaller levels, but they are more creatively designed, do more with their set of tricks, and the game itself has tons more atmosphere - mostly in the form of the Narrator, who makes silly quips to egg me on to continue playing. They could have ♥♥♥♥ed up and made him immensely irritating. But the writing and the delivery of said wrting straddles between irritating and flat, hitting the sweet spot between the two.\n\nAnd, most importantly - they've made different sets of levels for single and co-op experiences, which is all I need to recommend a co-op game to other people. Seriously, have you seen some of these co-op games? They pretend to have single player modes, but those modes are actually the co-op modes with a huge amount of restraint to keep from screaming "YOU DON'T WANT TO PLAY WITH OTHER PEOPLE? WHY NOT GO BACK TO READING BOOKS, YOU BIG DUMB FAT DORK, AND LEAVE THESE COOL VIDEO GAMES TO THE HIP FRIEND-HAVERS." The fact that the developers actually bothered to create campaigns to differentiate between the two is an automatic recommendation by itself. Kudos, The Behemoth. Battleblock Theater is the game for co-op hating people who want to play the game without friends, and then play later with friends if they so choose!","July 26, 2014","true","8.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","2"

And when I finally managed to buy it.. My oh my I was surprised! It was amazing! I laughed so much during the cutscenes, I raged during the frustrating levels especially on insane mode, man that's frustrating as heck omo, and the ending.... I just.. ;_; HWAAAAH--\nOkey, sorry about that, sometimes I go crazy when I think about sad things.. o_o\n\nSo anyways, you can play multiplayer! Two for Co-Op and up to four for versus mode! You can kill your friends or keep them as your slaves~ What the heck did I just say.. And you can trade prisoner heads! Wat\n\nOverall this game is FANTASTIC! I really recommend that you buy it whenever you get the chance because it's gonna be so worth it! It can trigger all of your feelings at the same time whatever that means and you will love it!\n\nSo, that's about it!

Alongside the fact I had heard it was an amazing game on the internet and through friends was what lead me to get BattleBlock Theatre.\n\nPositives:\n\n- Fantastic, interesting yet hilarious plot.\n- A wide variety of characters and powers/weapons achievable.\n- Each map is designed differently with chalanges such as fighting 'cats' and walking 'toast'.\n- There is always an aim/task at hand from completing maps on 'insane mode' to completing 'Furbottem's Features'.\n- How one uses the gems and balls of yarn they have collected through maps to buy new characters and weapons.\n- Online with friends is great with teamwork and completing maps causing much satisfaction.\n- Fubottem's Features is a great ad on with a much wanted character as the prize for completing the specific chapter.\n\nNegatives:\n\n- There are only 8 chapters. At least make it 10!\n- As much as it is a great game for many the £10.99 pound price tag on steam may be too much.\n\nTo conclude I think by far the positives in BBT out match the negatives. It is by a mile my favourite platform and indie game of 2014. The 28 hours I have played so far have been unbelievably fun having completed all 8 chapters of the plot and Furbottom's Features.\n","March 30, 2015","true","28.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","5","6","2","2"

In the normal stages, you must find at least three green gems and reach the exit in time. Each one you complete unlocks the next one, and the final one unlocks the finale. In the finale, you're racing against the clock. You still need three gems in the first part, though I'm not positive about the second. May as well collect them, just to be sure! You have to do these two stages back-to-back, you can't select one individually. Which is a little annoying when you've only missed the A++ grade on one of them, and aren't positive you even got it until after you've finished both and checked. The encores are all unlocked at the same time after the finale is completed. These are basically timed, more challenging normal stages, and are completely optional. But, you know. Do 'em.\n\nThere are plenty of other modes besides just rolling through the basic story mode by yourself. There's also an insane mode which forces you to start the entire level if you die even once! Did I mention there's an achievement in it, for you? There's also a co-op story. That also has an insane mode, in case there's anybody left in your life that you don't completely hate, yet (Stamper notwithstanding)! There's also an arena, which has eight different gametypes, including a fun sort of basketball game, a race to finish a level first, one where you have to rub up on all the tiles to change them to your team's color (my personal favorite), and of course just plain ol' beating the crap out of each other!\n\nYou can, of course, play community-built stages, as well, in single player, co-op, AND arena varieties. These don't get you gems (the currency for unlocking new prisoners) or yarn (the currency for unlocking new weapons) unless they're featured, but they'll help ease the shakes you'll get when you're jonesing for a BattleBlock fix.\n\nBattleBlock's difficulty is fair, and has a good learning curve. The music is all pretty groovy and gives you something easily worth listening to as you step on that obvious trap and die like an idiot.\n\nPro´s:\n\n+ Extremely creative and fun level & puzzle design\n+ Slick gameplay with precise controls\n+ Fantastic humor\n+ Easy to create servers\n+ Great co-op and multiplayer modes\n+ Editor with Steam Workshop integration\n+ Character customization\n\nCon´s:\n\n- Few very minor bugs, barely worth mentioning\n\n\n- Overall rating: Is a 14/15 (Must Own!)","February 16, 2015","true","23.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/238460/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","BattleBlock Theater made its debut in 2013, where it was released on the Xbox Live Marketplace. Finally coming to the PC in 2014, nothing has really been added to the core formula. However, the presentation is still wacky and irreverent; the platforming remains fun, and the level-editor is just as approachable as ever. Combine this with Steam Workshop integration, and you have a cute platformer that will keep you and your friends entertained for quite sometime.\n\nHatty Hattington, glorious leader and “best friend to one and all”, leads a crew of mates with humourously-shaped heads aboard the SS Friendship. That’s right - a ship, filled with friends. Friendship. Even after this very first, very blunt joke, it becomes almost unsurprisingly obvious that Castle Crashers masterminds The Behemoth are behind 2D puzzle-platformer BattleBlock Theatre, as they serve up some familiar slapstick-♥♥♥-tongue-in-cheek banter the way they know best: via garish and whimsical characters, button bashing brilliance, and diarrhea-infused humour.\n\nAfter a tumultuous voyage across the ocean, the SS Friendship runs aground on a mysterious uncharted island run by evil cats. Brought to life by the amazing narration of Will Stamper, we learn that the peninsula is controlled by a colony of nasty prison-keeping cats, hellbent on abducting the ship’s remaining crew, and pitting them against a series of twisted challenges for their amusement within a makeshift theatre. Placing their trust in Hatty to save the day, the crew are amazed to discover he has flipped allegiances, but do become inherently suspicious of the evil-looking, yet entirely stylish, glowing red tophat he has forcibly acquired since crash landing on the island.\nThis rather bizarre setup paves way for the hundreds of levels, which make up the majority of the game. The theater motif finds its way into the game’s layout as well; worlds (which are referred to as acts) are composed of nine or so individual levels (stages), and each world ends with a ‘finale’ level. Each level plays out on a theater stage, with catlike silhouettes creeping in the foreground, standing in for a ‘virtual’ audience. It’s all window dressing, sure, but this attention to detail and unwavering dedication to keep the player engaged is what makes BattleBlock Theater stand out from the rest of the platforming pack.\n\nIt’s ironic given how creative the setup is that the actual gameplay is simple, but what BattleBlock Theater might lack in novel mechanics and flashy gameplay is made up for with tight controls and excellent level design. Every level is laid out on what is essentially a grid, with various block types making up the floors and walls you maneuver your little avatar on. Some blocks might launch the character into the air or explode after a second or two, while others allow them to climb up or slide down walls. It’s actually quite impressive how much level variety the developers have managed to curate with a fairly limited set of tools, but the game’s nuance and depth becomes more apparent the deeper into the campaign you get.\n\nA mere triplicate of gems are required to unlock the exit in each level, but there tends to be a minimum of six in the stage. Plus a roll of yarn, which can be traded with corrupt feline guards in exchange for special weapons. These are handy for dispensing with roaming enemies that lurk in certain portions of some stages, but some also have additional uses like the gun which fires a sticky pellet that can provide you with an additional, temporary platform. One of the PC version’s tweaks is the ability to carry a pair of these weapons and switch between them.\n\nIf you want to get the elusive A+ grade and all of Stamper’s praise, it’s also necessary to finish each stage within a time limit. Early on, this happens practically by default, but (if you’re anything like me) you’ll quite rapidly turn into the school kid who knows he’s smart but feels like just coasting along on A’s and the occasional B rather than putting in the extra effort. If you’ve got the supple reflexes necessary for completing all of the Encore stages with an A+, then I salute you. If you can do it on Insane Mode (which removes all checkpoints, meaning any death returns you to the start of a stage) then you may very well be a witch of some kind.\n\nYour incentive for hunting down more gems is that they can be exchanged for one of BattleBlock Theater’s hundreds of prisoner heads. The heads come in all shapes and forms, so if you hoard enough gems the start of every level can be an identity crisis of your own making.\n\nBattleBlock Theater wouldn’t feel right if you weren’t able to tackle the game with a friend by your side, and The Behemoth hasn’t forgotten its Castle Crashers roots. Playing the campaign solo works perfectly fine, but BattleBlock was designed with co-op in mind, and it shows. There’s a great sense of urgency and pressure when playing co-op; not only will you have to work together in order to succeed, but collecting every gem and beating par times will require excellent teamwork.\n\nThere's good fun to be had in competition, too. Up to four players can duke it out in a handful of match types, both in free-for-all or in teams. Standard modes like King of the Hill and a basic challenge mode (essentially time attack) are rounded out with more creative ones, such as ‘Horse’, which tasks you with stealing the opposing team’s horses and riding them back to your own goal. Another favourite of mine was ‘Ball Game’, which is BattleBlock’s minimalist take on basketball. The multiplayer mode is complemented by robust matchmaking options, allowing you to play both online and off, with playlist modes mixing different multiplayer modes into one, well, playlist. To cap things off, there’s a robust level editor at your disposal, which provides you with the exact same toolset that The Behemoth used. Since each level and arena was designed with the same set of block types, it’s remarkably easy to break down your favourite layouts and incorporate them into your own custom design.\n\nIn essence, BattleBlock Theatre is not without its frustrating moments, but such is the nature of all puzzle platformers. Any negatives noted here exist, but are slight and surely nothing more than minor blips in what is a very rewarding, very well presented, and very enjoyable and hilariously funny puzzle platformer. As the landscape of these types of games becomes increasingly bigger, it’s nice to see a game strive so hard for innovation. And in doing so can make the player feel like the cat who got the cream. Perhaps I should leave the jokes to The Behemoth experts....\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=384796536\n\nA Must Play\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","January 31, 2015","true","28.5"," 16 of 28 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","16","28","0","0"

Battleblock Theater. Behemoth. Stamper. Cats.\nIn the begining this game will seem extremely fun and laughable like crazy.\nThe Campaign is great, the co-op Campaign and games are extremely fun.\nBut then comes the issues of a meh port.\nThere are many bugs, and exploits, such as the darts, that make the game either extremely fun or extremely frustrating.\nAlso, there are the custom levels. Oh Baby...\nThese custom levels featured in the Furbottom's Features are frustrating as nuts, some being buggy like crazy, and some being downright bad.\n\nYou can get heads from going on occasionally but theres also the hat that you unlock from the Features.\nThere's also the option to buy heads, and weapons.\nI find my self needing to shell out cash for some of these heads (being a collector of heads) when I can't do the Features due to shoddy craftsman ship, etc.\nSo yeah.\n\nTLDR: For those of you who want a great platformer that's some hallarious fun. Get this.\n\nBut remember, try not to dip into the Furbottom's Features or Custom Levels, as a good few of them will just make you frustrated on how it's broken.\n\nEnjoy, and prepare to buckle yo pants.","May 25, 2014","true","35.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bucchus/recommended/238460/","bucchus","Bucchus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bucchus/","1045 products in account","Great & funny platformer. The solo campaign could be compared to Super Meat Boy except it's not as merciless and doesn't require that much incredible precision. Don't be fooled by the easy first chapters, it does crank up the difficulty around the middle of the game. There's also puzzle influences with lots of levels utilizing switches.\n\nThe co-op campaign seemed fun too, with hilarious friendly fire accidents. The arena modes induced lots of yelling with the 2v2 local multiplayer modes that were more like chaotic brawler games instead of skilled platforming. Since there's an editor built-in you can play random assortments of uploaded levels if you find the official levels dull.\n\nIn addition to the gameplay, the main draw of the game is the comedy side. The story makes no sense but it's really entertaining, mostly thanks to the narrator. The cartoony animated artstyle is great (very similar to Castle Crashers), the soundtrack is awesome and the excellent constant narrator quips make everything funny. There's hundreds of stupid looking unlockable heads to collect. Check the Steam store trailer to see if the game's particular style of wacky lolrandom crazy works for you.\n\nAs a pure platformer I'd most likely gotten bored before finishing the game, but the cartoony aesthetics carried it and I finished the main story because every raving cutscene after a chapter is a treat. The 4-person couch arena chaos is a fine addition to Broforce and Gang Beasts evenings.","August 25, 2014","true","50.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I have played through the story on co-op and have gotten all As and A+s except for one B. Let me be the first to say I was absolutely wrong to be skeptical. This game got my expectations, blew them out of the water, caught them, pooped on them, then punched them into spikes and lava. It is an absolutely amazing game to play co-op. I would recommend getting this game even if you do not enjoy platformers, though I would suggest getting someone to play it with. Single player is still very fun.\nPros:\n-Difficult levels. They start easy but get much harder later on.\n-Co-op is fun and works well for the most part (will explain in cons).\n-Steamworks and player-created levels.\n-Smooth controls and very easy to learn.\n-Nice controller support.\n-Good and well-made game mechanics, but still very silly and enjoyable.\n-Some gems and yarn (collectibles) are difficult to find and get.\n-A lot of different faces to unlock.\nCons:\n-Keyboard controls aren't the best, but are tolerable. (Me and my girlfriend went through all of co-op, her on a keyboard, so very much doable and tolerable, but controller is recommended)\n-Boulders. If you are playing with an internet friend that is relatively far from you (probably 100-150 ms), the non-host can sometimes be killed by simply picking up a boulder and doing nothing with it.\n-Yarn becomes useless after a while. It is used to purchase weapons, but you can buy all of your weapons by chapter 5 or so.\n-Not a lot of replay value aside community maps.\n-Some weapons are essentially useless, but can still be fun to mess around with.\nOverall 9.5/10. One of the most enjoyable games I have played in a long while. It's honestly just pure, straight fun.

The co-op is great, there are some lag issues that I look forward to being fixed. The arena is fun if you have friends to play with, or just in a public lobby where strangers can join in the middle of the game and leave whenever. I can only assume the local co-op is just as great as online with no lag. The steam workshop is a great add-on to include endless amounts of fun playing with maps and arenas. I think that the part where you sell heads and weapons on steam trades is pretty much useless on how easy it is to get them.","June 3, 2014","true","43.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The game doesn't have a tutorial level or anything. You learn what to do with little signs that could give you hints about an area, and you develop your skills over some time. BattleBlock Theater lets you learn about the game as you play without any interruption, and it still manages to throw something new at you once you think you've got it all down.\n\nThe platforming is flat-out fantastic. The different blocks/obstacles they created can be used in a million different ways, and the storyline perfectly demonstrates that. You can also create your own levels! There can be a million types of levels. Whether it's a speed run, or a level based on rythmic timing, you name it,  it can be made!\n\nI give this game a 10/10!

The co-op is great, there are some lag issues that I look forward to being fixed. The arena is fun if you have friends to play with, or just in a public lobby where strangers can join in the middle of the game and leave whenever. I can only assume the local co-op is just as great as online with no lag. The steam workshop is a great add-on to include endless amounts of fun playing with maps and arenas. I think that the part where you sell heads and weapons on steam trades is pretty much useless on how easy it is to get them.","June 3, 2014","true","43.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Wow this is a super addicting Platform game with alot of cool elements! It's has lots of funny bits in it and I rate this 10/10 I would say that this is super fun and I love that you can edit your own puzzle. I also love that you can customize your character with items you have to earn. Like TF2, but you get items quicker, and you don't spend a penny after you have bought this amazing game. I got this for the steam summer sale, the trailers where halarious, and my dad bought it just then! I would say get it now while its cheap. Its so worth buying this game! I'd say that this is my favourite game of the year! If you don't have it, I am sorry for you.... So save up to get it. You won't regret buying this. Yes, there is mild blood here and there, like on the stage fail screen, but really its not bad at all. GET THIS GAME! AWESOME GAME! Btw one more thing, I have played maybe a little more than an hour and I have 22 items for this. Its easy, so don't be like (Errrg I don't want to look like a noob with noob stuff and I want more items without spending my money any more) There are steam cards for this game and I like that part of it too. The story is pretty funny, and well written. A little random too. So seriously I could've said Get this game. then posted this, but I like this game so much I put time in the review. So if my message isn't coming through completely; I THINK YOU SHOULD GET THIS GAME! :D Thank you.

The different blocks/obstacles they created can be used in a million different ways, and the storyline perfectly demonstrates that. You can also create your own levels!

With a 10+ hour story, a lot of extras and secrets to find to get A++ rating in a levels, it's a game with a lot of things to do. if you are planning to do all those things, prepare to play for 30+ hours. Battleblock have cool cartoon graphics, easy gameplay, a lot of cool weapons, and hundreds of heads for customization!

Wow this is a super addicting Platform game with alot of cool elements! It's has lots of funny bits in it and I rate this 10/10 I would say that this is super fun and I love that you can edit your own puzzle. I also love that you can customize your character with items you have to earn. Like TF2, but you get items quicker, and you don't spend a penny after you have bought this amazing game. I got this for the steam summer sale, the trailers where halarious, and my dad bought it just then! I would say get it now while its cheap. Its so worth buying this game! I'd say that this is my favourite game of the year! If you don't have it, I am sorry for you.... So save up to get it. You won't regret buying this. Yes, there is mild blood here and there, like on the stage fail screen, but really its not bad at all. GET THIS GAME! AWESOME GAME! Btw one more thing, I have played maybe a little more than an hour and I have 22 items for this. Its easy, so don't be like (Errrg I don't want to look like a noob with noob stuff and I want more items without spending my money any more) There are steam cards for this game and I like that part of it too. The story is pretty funny, and well written. A little random too. So seriously I could've said Get this game. then posted this, but I like this game so much I put time in the review. So if my message isn't coming through completely; I THINK YOU SHOULD GET THIS GAME! :D Thank you. Have a nice day :3\n\n\n~LittleBigBug","June 22, 2014","true","9.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Oxymorion/recommended/238460/","Oxymorion","Oxymorion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Oxymorion/","8 products in account","BattleBlock Theater is one of the funniest games I've played. The game takes place in a deserted theater that is now overrun by cats. After your boat crashes the cats kidnap your best friend Hatty and force him into running the theater. You and all of your other friends are now prisoners being forced to perform for the audience that will pay a good amount of gems to see you get destroyed in any way possible. To complete a level you must evade all the obstacles and collect gems along the way, until you reach the exit (Note: The exit will only open if you have collected three gems or more) Like I said before this games story is hilarious but that doesn't mean the game itself is all that soft. No, the difficulty grows higher and higher until you get mad of seeing your character blow up, drown, get pierced by spikes and get eaten. The closest i can compare, in the case of despicable enemy/trap placement, is Mega Man. But don't worry your not just some helpless little performer, because you get to carry two of many insane weapons that may come in handy to kill something or to reach some areas. Control wise this game has really responsive and tight controls, but it would be best to play with a controller and not your keyboard. The multiplayer part of the game is fantastic, you can play through the story with a friend or get four people together to play a new form of basketball or challenge each other  by creating your own levels in the level creator.\n\nThis game is great for when you just want to try something different that’s  fun but at the same time challenging, so if you have money and you dont know what to do with it I really suggest buying BattleBlock Theater.","May 7","true","7.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's a very intense platformer, particularly if you've got a "go big or go home" attitude like myself and try to do hardcore mode. The difficulty progression is fairly cozy; it doesn't hold your hand, but eventually you're going to have to do quite a bit of thinking to try and get some decent scores. Absolute tons of character heads to get if you're a customization-savvy person, as well as several weapons to use, although they aren't as useful as I'd like them to be. Trying to get those perfect scores and find the hidden gems gets really tough, but you feel pretty accomplished once you find them all and can still speed your way through the level fast enough. Co-op is really fun as well, with different challenges so you can enjoy a whole new world of levels with a friend.\n\nThe voice acting is phenomal, as I would expect from Stamper. The story-line is fairly light, but still hilarious with said VA. Music isn't something I usually comment on, as I don't really pay attention to it for whatever reason, but I really enjoyed the sound-track. Various songs on each of the levels,\n\nGraphically, it's pretty similar to any of The Behemoth's other games; not to say that's a bad thing. It's very good, with plenty of dynamic animations everywhere to keep your attention to what's going on. As usual, a nice, clean, consistent look to it, and overall looks great.\n\nTL;DR - If you enjoy challenging but rewarding platformers, and are looking for something new and interesting, I definitely recommend Battleblock Theater.","October 19, 2014","true","11.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The Steam integration with it is fairly unique for a third-party title and allows a new way of building your collection of prisons and your arsenal, although the ability to import your own custom heads makes the market feel slightly redundant if you use it. The level creator allows for endless replay-ability with the Steam workshop, and the brilliant narration just seal’s the deal and adds to the overall charm of the game.\n\nSummary:\n+ Charming art style.\n+ Fantastic writing and narration.\n+ Great Steam integration.\n+ Brilliant co-op mode.\n+ Great level editor.\n- Custom content makes Steam integration feel redundant.\n- Combat feels slightly clunky.","May 16, 2014","true","7.7"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","1"

Why, didn't I buckle my pants. now its everywhere, my excitement that is! BattleBlock Theater is the newest (and coolest) game from The Behemoth yet! It uses the same familiar art style combined with, in my opinion gameplay that feels like Castle Crashers and Super Meat Boy had a baby. Its great and coupled with a huge variety of co-op and pvp game modes makes for hours of fun. If hours aren't enough though BattleBlock Theater comes with its own "in house" level and playlist creator, if you want even more customization though the game has a bunch of weapons and hundreds of character heads but BattleBlock Theater even comes with the feature to import your own character head as easy as drag 'n' drop! BattleBlock Theater is worth your time whether you are a fan of The Behemoths games or platformers in general, try BattleBlock. A fair warning though you really should buckle your pants.

In order to complete a level you need to adleast get Three gems. But if you want bonus points get the rest of em inorder to gain more gems. Almost each level there is a yarn ball(there kinda secret to find but some are easy) after you complete 3 levels in a chapter it will take you outside where you have 2 options either got to the next level/chapter or you could spend your gems and yarn for heads and weapons. to get a Head it costs 10 Gems and the Weapons cost 5 Yarn balls.\nAlso there are other gamemodes in the game to. such as VS or co-op where you can go 1v1 or 2v2 or even 2v1.\nThe main story can also be co-op But teamwork is always requierd in this.\n\nSo i hope my review has help you alot and enjoy playing :)","July 6, 2014","true","3.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Oh, wait, that's three. Oh well. Did I mention it was fun? But in all seriousness, this game is really rather addicting due to its unique personality. Being a platformer, the basic gameplay style is the same: jump platform to platform and avoid death. There is combat if you so wish to kill the cat guards that try to end your fabulous jumping spree, or very little if you choose not to (though you'll miss some gems, used to unlock prisoners (new faces), for that perfect score!). There is a decent variety of melee moves and a good armory of weapons, each with different effects both harmful and helpful. For example, the acid bubble: as the name implies, it's acidic, and you or any enemy who gets caught in it or going through it is killed; however you can jump on top of it and bounce off to reach new heights for some more gems or maybe the ever-so-precious yarn, used to unlock weapons. The silly storyline (it involves a boat of friends appropriately called the S.S. Friendship) and annoying-but-not-in-a-bad-way narrator are enough to motivate you through the solo campaign, though the option of the co-op campaign (same storyline, new levels) is really rather tempting, and is rewarding. Both players earn all gems and yarn earned in every level, except for the mysterious, shiny, golden hat, which keeps a slightly competetive feel to it, even though you're best friends now! There are separate achievements for beating the game on normal difficulty, co-op normal, insane, and co-op insane, so there are reasons to replay it, besides being outstandlingly fun that is. And once you tire of the storyline (or at the very least want a break, because who can ditch Hatty? Nobody, that's who.) there are several different "arena" modes and the exclusive features to play through. Arena games (including King of the Hill and a silly form of Basketball) offer a competetive PvP side while the Furbottom Features offer more co-op rewards and player integration through the Steam Workshop. There is a level editor of course, meaning that you can endlessly spawn new challenges for you and your friends or to listen to the tears of the other players who don't realize you put some invisible block somewhere (I don't think that's possible, and if it is...don't be heartless, we're all friends here). If you're not big into silly, happy, carefree, happy-go-lucky-e-t-c. games, well, deal with it, because this game is worth every penny you'll spend on it. It's a good platformer with incentives to replay and to do more than just the campaign, and I suppose you could mute it, if you're masochisitic. Another valuable point I think is worth mentioning is that this is a semi-popular game, and it's on Steam with an interactive community and game developers (Chicken Toucher achievement anybody?) so this game has really good potential of being updated frequently. With a base game already worth the full price and more, additional content really pushes it over the edge. Hope to see you on!","May 24, 2014","true","37.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Coming into the game having watched a few videos on it, I'd thought it would have been a nice time to just fool around and murder your friends and whatnot. I got that, but what I had expected should have been more. I underestimated just how fun the game was.\n\nYou're given tight controls, clean and art that is very good to look at. The music fits the game very well and for me, personally, much like Newgrounds music does. I've found myself rather focused on the game itself to even notice the music, and when I do, Stamper's off, meowing a few times, or something. It's humourous, it's comical, the cutscenes are done in a pesudo-puppet show fashion and pulls out plenty of fun visual gags.\n\nThe level design works very well for the platforming-puzzle mechanic is has going on, and each level seemingly has those optimal designs which makes killing your friends a breeze.\n\nThe weapon seem simple at first, but they can be used to bend the game or make certain aspects easier, considering you're skilled enough to use them, which can make speedrunning much more viable.\n\nIf you are going to play this game, however, Grab a Friend, and preferably one who is perfectly fine with dying a few times by your hands, and willing to do the same!

The full written review can be viewed at http://coasterdude.moonfruit.com/#/video-game-reviews/4579924389/BattleBlock-Theater-Steam-Edition-Review/8472882.\n\nThe Behemoth have returned with another game that will blow your pants off, so be sure to keep them buckled.  The game I'm referring to is the Steam edition of  “BattleBlock Theater,” a unique platformer filled with more than enough content.  This game takes the iconic game mechanic of “press A to jump,” and twists it into a brand new experience.  It takes place on an island of prisoners that have been imprisoned by cats where they are then forced to participate in deadly stage productions that require a lot of battling and a lot of blocks.\n\nEach level is linear, but requires you to find at least 3 gems that happen to be scattered throughout the level to unlock the exit.  There are at least 5 gems to find, and a majority of the gems are hidden inside mini-puzzles that deviate from the main path of the level.  This gives each level a much needed sense of complexity.  More importantly, the 3 gems that are required to exit the level are usually placed in spots that are almost impossible to miss.  To give the player the motivation for finding more than 3 gems, the game allows the player to use gems to purchase additional characters to play as.  However, I rarely felt compelled to find gems for the sake of a new character.  I honestly loved finding gems because of the feeling of satisfaction that I'd get from finding them in the first place.  This system of reward for exploration is astoundingly perfect.  Players that feel the need to collect as many gems as possible are well rewarded, and players that don't want to collect all of the gems are not punished.\n\nIn addition, each level has 1 ball of golden yarn, and a majority of the levels contain combative cats.  The cats I'm referring to are the enemies of the game.  Their primary purpose in life seems to be to stop the player from getting to the exit via fireballs, bouncing balls, nerf guns, etc.  Although some of the cats are placed in spots where they can easily be killed by solving a minor puzzle, there are times where the player can be ambushed and must defend themself.  This game has many weapons that the player can use to attack or defend with.  Each weapon can be purchased with 5 balls of golden yarn, and each ball of golden yarn is found within the hardest mini-puzzle of each level.  Although getting 5 balls of golden yarn for just one weapon seems like too much effort, the reward is great.  The ability to kill a cat by throwing an exploding paper airplane at them is one of the greatest satisfactions to be had from this game.\n\nWhen playing a level, there is a chance of a golden hat randomly popping up somewhere.  If the golden hat is found and taken to the exit, the player is rewarded with 10 gems.  However, this is harder than it sounds because dying will cause the player to drop the hat.  If the hat is ever dropped in water, which is abundant, the hat is lost forever.  Not to mention that dying is very common in this game.  This game finds the perfect balance between having fun and being challenging.  Although it can be incredibly hard to get to the end of a level, The Behemoth make dying in this game an easy thing to handle.  This is thanks to the checkpoint system in the game.  There are many checkpoints placed on the way to the exit, so any progress lost due to a death is not too irritating.  However, for the maniacs out there, The Behemoth gives the player the option to play the whole game on just one life.  This option is called “Insane Mode” and is justly named.\n\nWhere the game truly shines is in its co-op campaign.  Although the solo and co-op campaigns are similar, the co-op levels are more fun and more hilarious the whole way through.  Each death stops being a punishment and becomes an excuse to laugh at your friend's failure.  This laughter is usually followed by the death of the laugher's character.  Solving puzzles in the co-op campaign are infinitely more fun that solving the puzzles in the solo campaign.  There truly is something magical to be felt whenever a puzzle is solved with two minds as opposed to just one.  However, the co-op campaign has one huge problem that hinders how much fun the campaign could actually be.  Although the checkpoint system still exists in the co-op campaign, the game seems rather confused about where to respawn  characters.  These respawn areas usually end up being next to the co-op partner, at the latest checkpoint, or at the previous checkpoint.  This can end up in some puzzles being solved earlier than they should or some players spawning farther back than they should.  Either of those scenarios don't seem fair.  Thankfully, even with the respawn problem, the co-op campaign never stops being fun, even in the last 2 chapters.\n\nOne of the greatest parts about the campaign mode actually has to be the plot.  That may seem like a silly thing to praise about a platformer, but the plot was surprisingly well made for this game.  Giving any of it away would be a spoiler, but how the plot is exposed is what makes it so much fun.  Each cutscene in the game is animated wonderfully and contains some of the funniest narration I have ever heard in a video game.  Each cutscene is shown at the end of a chapter, so each cutscene feels like a well-deserved reward.  The ending definitely has to be one of the most enjoyable endings I've ever seen in a video game and will definitely be creating a new fad of belt-buckling.\n\nAside from the campaign mode, there are also many competitive multiplayer modes that can be played by up to 4 people, but most of them fell flat for me.  They can all be described as unfair and chaotic in a bad way.  For example, there's a gamemode called “Challenge” which simply let's two teams race to the end of a level.  The team that takes the least amount of times wins.  As fun as that may sound, playing that mode was severely disappointing to me.  This was mainly because the two teams do not race at the same time.  One team goes while the other watches.  This is a major problem because a majority of the time spent on a level is puzzle-solving.  In this scenario, the team going second will always have the upper hand.  However, the “Muckle” and “Ball Game” modes are rather fun to play.  “Muckle” is simply a team deathmatch mode, which is hard to screw up, and “Ball Game” is a unique take on basketball.  However, there are many multiplayer modes out there in the gaming world that these multiplayer modes simply cannot compete with.\n\nIf you feel like this game needs more content, then you should know that there's even a level creator.  The level creator is a very useful tool that will give this game the longevity that it deserves.  Even if you're not the creative type, created levels can be downloaded.  Chances are that this game will give you many puzzles to solve and many platforms to jump on for a long time to come.\n\n“BattleBlock Theater: Steam Edition” is a very refreshing take on a genre that has been flooded with games.  Not only is the story worth noting, but the levels are as well.  This game is challenging, but rarely stops being fun.  The co-op campaign adds a whole knew level of hilarity and fun that most co-op campaigns miss.  The level creator  definitely gives me a reason to keep checking back on the game once in a while.  However, the competitive multiplayer modes left a bad taste in my mouth.  Overall, this is definitely a game worth jumping for joy about.","July 25, 2014","true","32.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There are lots of reasons to buy this masterpiece, including the ones below:\n\n-The Gameplay\nWhat Battleblock Theater esentially is is a 2-d platformer with lots of fun mechanics, blocks with various behaviours, and most importantly, things that can kill you. This action is divided into 8 different chapters, with 9 levels each, a finale consisting of 2 timed levels in each chapter, and the optional encore, bringing you and the crowd back for more.\n\n-The Story\nThe gist of the plot is that a boat of friends were going on an adenture, but then their terrible fate got them shipwrecked on a mysterious island. It turns out that the island is a prison maintained by cat guards, where the prisoners are put on stage with obstacles of death coming from everywhere. This pleases the audience and racks up a lot of cash, but you have one goal: to rescue your friends and escape. More of this story is told in detail with the 8 HILARIOUS cutscenes throughout the story.\n\n-Story Mode\nStory mode is the original campaign mode, which is fun to do and has VERY funny cutscenes (unless you're a cat, then it is very much offensive) and that's all there is to that.\n\n-Insane Mode\nWhen you've beaten story mode, you can play a version of campaign that makes you restart the level whenever you die. This way, it's not a game that remains unused in your inventory after beating the story. Insane mode is also an infuriating nightmare which will unbuckle your pants when you try to finish it, but a shiny golden trophy for your prisoner is the prize when you beat it, so I guess that's that.\n\n-Collectibles\nEvery level has 3-7 gems and 1 yarn, plus a certain set time limit for a bonus. If you get all of these in a level, the A++ award is given to you. You can spend the gems on more prisoner heads and you can spend yarn on weapons, both of which are marketable and tradeable. If not that, you can keep the yarn and gems to trade later. This game also features trading cards and acheivments. Custom heads can also be made with the right software.\n\n-Steam Workshop\nThe Steam Workshop contains levels all rolled up in a playlist, which are of course user-created. The level editor allows you to do this too. Furbottom's features are the weekly event in which Behemoth picks a user-created playlist that's really well-made and features it. The prize for finishing the feature is a special head.\n\n\n=-Multiplayer Features\n*ALL OF THE CONTENT SHOWN ABOVE IS IN MULTIPLAYER MODE TOO*\n\n-(The campaign in multiplayer is slightly adjusted so that it has co-operative features)\n\n-Arena Mode\nArena mode is the place where players can get into a competitive play. There are 8 different Arena gamemodes.\n\nThere's Muckle, all-out combat.\nThere's Color the World, a game in which you try to color the blocks with your touch.\nThere's Ball Game, basketball with carries and a soccer ball.\nThere's Capture the Pig, kinda like Capture the Flag.\nThere's Grab the Gold, where you grab gold and put it in a safe place.\nThere's Challenge, a race to see who is fastest.\nThere's King of the Hill, a fight to maintain your position.\nand there's Soul Stealer, where you grab the souls of the other team.\n\nFurbottom's Features and Steam Workshop both apply to Arena mode too. Have fun beating your friends.\n\nSo, choose for yourself. Would you like this game or not? (I know I would.)","June 17, 2014","true","123.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Sounds simple, but the levels get much harder with different kinds of puzzles to solve and enemies to avoid. The game voiced by the wonderfully talented Newgrounds animator Will Stamper. Definitely more fun to play as couch co-op with a friend but it works online if you have some commuication. Definitely worth every penny. A perfect 10/10 game for me.

It has nice level designs and if you don't want to play by yourself, don't worry because there is a some minigames you could play with four people or you could play with another friend to play campaign. (4 players - minigames) ( 2 players - campaign). There is a whole bunch of cool items you can get and also a rediculous amount of heads. ( also if you get castle crashers you will have a head of the knight, and also so you can play as hatty in castle crashers).\n\nI would rate this game 9/10 because one thing i had a problem was bad respawns on co op campaign.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrivateGodfrey/recommended/238460/","PrivateGodfrey","Captain MooMoos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrivateGodfrey/","490 products in account","This is a long review so if you want a brief summary of why I recommend BattleBlock Theater then skip to Results and read from there.\n\nThe Behemoth creates yet another comedy as they strive for gold in the ever ending cosmos that is the adventures of a shipwrecked crew on a terrible, no awful, wait… no terrible works, Island!!! BattleBlock Theater is a wonder game, with amusing anecdotes, rides, and all sorts of malarkey.\n\nStory:\nYou play a member of an amazing crew of friends on you could say a friendship. As it sails across the ocean you are all having fun. Then a little storm rolls its way, the ship sways, but don’t worry nothing is wrong until suddenly out of nowhere the storm rocks a ghastly blow. Your crew is thrown everywhere, it’s very scary, trust me I saw it all. Your ship is marooned on a small little island, and the crew is held captive where else but BattleBlock Isla *cough* Theater. You leader, Hatty Hattington, is being held captive by some cats, as he sets up theatre spectacles that involve death and traps. It is your job to save him and escape from this woe, but will you succeed… well I don’t know but it will be fun to watch.\n\nCampaign:\nThe campaign is broken up across eight chapters; each one has an outro cinematic that adds to the overall story. Each chapter consists of eleven required levels and three encores. The encores are drastically more difficult than the normal levels, and if you do not go back to a previous chapter to view the levels again you may not even know they exist. As you progress through the campaign you receive two forms of currency “Yarn” and “Gems”. You can use Gems to unlock prisoners; this essentially allows you to change your appearance. You can use Yarn to unlock weapons, each weapon costs five Yarn. Each level offers anywhere from 3-9 gems (typically 7 or 9) and 1 yarn. Be careful what you buy, as you can only get the max numbers of gems for each level one time. If you get six gems one time and then plays it again and get seven you get only onre gem.\n\nGameplay:\nBattleBlock Theatre is a unique platformer that combines puzzle solving, item collection, enemies, and abilities into an incredibly in-depth game.  There are thirteen weapons you can use, each have their own purpose. In order to progress through a level you must collect at least three gems, although if you don’t collect everything and get the best time you’ll only at most get an A rather than an A++. One of the brilliant elements of this game is how each level has its own puzzles and secrets to solve. Unlock a typical platformer this game gets you to go through sections again moving blocks and manipulating enemies in order to solve complex puzzles and tasks. As you progress further through the campaign and especially on the encore levels you will notice how difficult the game can really get. Insane mode is the exact same as normal, except if you die it’s over. I would recommend normal, as insane is more likely something you’d want to do with a friend, that way if one of you dies at least the other can make it through.\n\nSteam Support:\nThis game has workshop support, which is awesome as it allows you to download custom levels and upload your own. There are a huge variety of custom campaigns out there, which give you a whole bunch of new levels to play once you’ve beaten the original game. The community provides loads of new campaigns which is great if you are looking for a game with high replay value.\n\nResults:\nBattleBlock Theater is a spectacle to see, with action, and puzzles, and comedy that is just plain awesome. There are loads of levels, and depending on your play-style the campaign can take easily up to eight hours. Of course the levels in the campaign have high replay value, but to push it even further this game provides workshop content that continually updated by the players. There are loads of custom made campaigns and levels which you could try. Plus there are fun arena games where you can battle with/against friends or even random people. BattleBlock Theater has a lot of offer and if you love platformers you will want to get this game.\n\nPros:\n+Combination of action, platformer, puzzle, and objective.\n+Great cinematics (there is a lot of comedy in this game and the cinematics between chapters were one of the big reasons I beat this game so quickly)\n+Loads of workshop content including custom campaigns\n+Keyboard/Mouse Mapping and Controller Support\n+A built in level-editor\n+Awesome multiplayer arena battles\n+Complete character customization (with over 300 prisoners)\n+Thirteen amazing weapons, not including your fists\n+Brilliant Soundtrack, I couldn’t help myself dancing at the end of each level.\n\nCons:\n-The keyboard and mouse support seem flaky, it was as if they didn’t really try to port over a good control system.","July 19, 2014","true","13.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Oh, wait, that's three. Oh well. Did I mention it was fun? But in all seriousness, this game is really rather addicting due to its unique personality. Being a platformer, the basic gameplay style is the same: jump platform to platform and avoid death. There is combat if you so wish to kill the cat guards that try to end your fabulous jumping spree, or very little if you choose not to (though you'll miss some gems, used to unlock prisoners (new faces), for that perfect score!). There is a decent variety of melee moves and a good armory of weapons, each with different effects both harmful and helpful. For example, the acid bubble: as the name implies, it's acidic, and you or any enemy who gets caught in it or going through it is killed; however you can jump on top of it and bounce off to reach new heights for some more gems or maybe the ever-so-precious yarn, used to unlock weapons. The silly storyline (it involves a boat of friends appropriately called the S.S. Friendship) and annoying-but-not-in-a-bad-way narrator are enough to motivate you through the solo campaign, though the option of the co-op campaign (same storyline, new levels) is really rather tempting, and is rewarding. Both players earn all gems and yarn earned in every level, except for the mysterious, shiny, golden hat, which keeps a slightly competetive feel to it, even though you're best friends now! There are separate achievements for beating the game on normal difficulty, co-op normal, insane, and co-op insane, so there are reasons to replay it, besides being outstandlingly fun that is. And once you tire of the storyline (or at the very least want a break, because who can ditch Hatty? Nobody, that's who.) there are several different "arena" modes and the exclusive features to play through. Arena games (including King of the Hill and a silly form of Basketball) offer a competetive PvP side while the Furbottom Features offer more co-op rewards and player integration through the Steam Workshop. There is a level editor of course, meaning that you can endlessly spawn new challenges for you and your friends or to listen to the tears of the other players who don't realize you put some invisible block somewhere (I don't think that's possible, and if it is...don't be heartless, we're all friends here). If you're not big into silly, happy, carefree, happy-go-lucky-e-t-c. games, well, deal with it, because this game is worth every penny you'll spend on it. It's a good platformer with incentives to replay and to do more than just the campaign, and I suppose you could mute it, if you're masochisitic. Another valuable point I think is worth mentioning is that this is a semi-popular game, and it's on Steam with an interactive community and game developers (Chicken Toucher achievement anybody?) so this game has really good potential of being updated frequently. With a base game already worth the full price and more, additional content really pushes it over the edge. Hope to see you on!","May 24, 2014","true","37.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Well too bad if you don’t because Battleblock Theater is entirely a multiplayer game. I vouched for the local co-op option via Steam’s big picture feature. This game from The Behemoth, the guys who produced Castle Crashers and Alien Hominid, so you can be guaranteed a game with an odd sense of humour. The game is starts off telling the story about how hundreds of friends set sail on the S.S Friendship with the bestest fried of all, Hatty Hattington. And you know the rest, ship crashes on mysterious island, Hatty is mind controlled by an evil top hat and all the friends are captured by cats to be thrown into gruesome theatre productions orchestrated by the new evil Hatty.\n\nBattleblock Theater is fun game to play with soon-to-be ex-friends, not so fun by yourself.\n\nFor full review, visit:\nhttp://icarusreviews.net/2014/07/23/brief-write-of-a-brief-flight-battleblock-theater/","July 23, 2014","true","1.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The levels go easy to hard with 8 differnt chapters with 13 levels in each one of them. You collect gems and golden yarn balls that you can trade in for differnt player heads and a varitey of weapons. The voice acting in this game was fantastic, also the level designs were interesting and very challenging during the end. I spent about 20ish hours completing the game with a few breaks. There is also level deisgn which is simple enough to use. I made my first level in about 30ish minutes. I'd rate the game alone about 9/10.\n\n-The game does have alot of bugs when it comes to multiplayer. It's not very lenient with higher ping players. I myself have around 150 ping on a regular bases. When it came to pulling up players it made them spin and then fall. Collecting gems and golden yarn was also a problem it wouldn't count towards the score, I never did find out where they went. I also wish their were more customazion like maybe ramps or differnt styled blocks you could use in workshop levels. Which don't get me wrong this game is fantastic but higher ping players have a hard time enjoying multiplayer.

The amount of levels you go through are close to endless. The great thing about this game too, is that it has a story line, although the actual fun part are the levels. Its creative how they put that together. Also, if you arent having alot of fun by yourself, you even play online with other people or with your friend in your own prived lobby of 2 or 4 friends.

This game is a big ball of fun, happiness, colors, hats, and more fun all rolled up together. You play as a person betrayed by your best friend and imprisioned by cats. The cats force you to put on these elaborate shows (The levels) for their entertainment. Out of the box its a fun simple quirky platformer. The first levels are simple, but they do good to explain the simple mechanics of the game. The single player is quite long and gets pretty hard. I recommend playing this with a friend. friends will also enjoy the insane multiplayer arena. The arena features a wide variety of amazing minigames. You can play with a few friends or random people online or if you have no friends there are bots. There is also a level editor that works with steam workshop. I have not used that in the full release but is looks quite fun. I was interestd in this game when it was just for Xbox, and quickly signed up for the PC beta when it was announced.

So, now it's been released on Steam a year later, and I completely believe that it was worth the wait. I appreciate the amount of love and effort was put into this game, and making it unlike any other game I've played (yes, it's a platformer, but it's more than that). The only thing I can criticize is the amount of players on the "Online" mode. This might just be because people are in Private Lobbies, but I'm not sure. Even if that's not the case, it has nothing to do with the quality of the game.\n\nThe storyline is fantastic (in my opinion) and it shows character (just like Castle Crasher's did, but with actual narration. Probably more so.). I enjoyed the narrator (StampyTV) throughout the entire game, and laughed a bit each time he had something to say. The multiplayer is great. Unlike their previous title (Castle Crashers), Battleblock Theater has many more gamemodes (both Co-op and competitive). All of them are fairly entertaining. I highly encourage any fans of Castle Crashers or platformers to take a look at this game, and perhaps buy it if they haven't already!","May 17, 2014","true","28.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The result is that it feels like you are playing a party game which is wonderful when playing punishing platformer puzzles.\n\nThe Positives\n- As a platformer the puzzles are excellent and there are many levels/stages\n- big variety of new and old platformer gameplay mechanics; eg. enemies that chase you and bump you around\n- a story in a platformer, yes I know 'who cares', but it is a delightful non-sequitur intermission to the rest of the game.\n- whimsical humour - from the story narration to commentary on your deaths & level completion\n- 4 player co-op online or 2 player local\n- great soundtrack & Voice Acting\n- Cartoon-y art style is pleasing\n\nI didn't feel that a gamepad was necessary, so that means if you do have a gamepad then 2 player local co-op will be easy.\n\nThe only real problem I/you have is that the game strongly prefers to be online. You can't get all the bonus gear if you are not online (largely cosmetic items which you trade for with in game collectable gems).Steam Cloud Sync is buggy and you may all lose progress switching between online and offline. If you discover you have to start over again (i.e. saves wiped), immediately kill the game so it doesn't autosave - then resync online. Got me twice, sigh.\n\nConclusion:\nA very good spin on the platformer genre - highly recommended if you want a platformer or a 2 player "couch co-op" game.","July 28, 2014","true","2.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The result is that it feels like you are playing a party game which is wonderful when playing punishing platformer puzzles.\n\nThe Positives\n- As a platformer the puzzles are excellent and there are many levels/stages\n- big variety of new and old platformer gameplay mechanics; eg. enemies that chase you and bump you around\n- a story in a platformer, yes I know 'who cares', but it is a delightful non-sequitur intermission to the rest of the game.\n- whimsical humour - from the story narration to commentary on your deaths & level completion\n- 4 player co-op online or 2 player local\n- great soundtrack & Voice Acting\n- Cartoon-y art style is pleasing\n\nI didn't feel that a gamepad was necessary, so that means if you do have a gamepad then 2 player local co-op will be easy.\n\nThe only real problem I/you have is that the game strongly prefers to be online. You can't get all the bonus gear if you are not online (largely cosmetic items which you trade for with in game collectable gems).Steam Cloud Sync is buggy and you may all lose progress switching between online and offline. If you discover you have to start over again (i.e. saves wiped), immediately kill the game so it doesn't autosave - then resync online. Got me twice, sigh.\n\nConclusion:\nA very good spin on the platformer genre - highly recommended if you want a platformer or a 2 player "couch co-op" game.","July 28, 2014","true","2.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The levels go easy to hard with 8 differnt chapters with 13 levels in each one of them. You collect gems and golden yarn balls that you can trade in for differnt player heads and a varitey of weapons. The voice acting in this game was fantastic, also the level designs were interesting and very challenging during the end. I spent about 20ish hours completing the game with a few breaks. There is also level deisgn which is simple enough to use. I made my first level in about 30ish minutes. I'd rate the game alone about 9/10.\n\n-The game does have alot of bugs when it comes to multiplayer. It's not very lenient with higher ping players. I myself have around 150 ping on a regular bases. When it came to pulling up players it made them spin and then fall. Collecting gems and golden yarn was also a problem it wouldn't count towards the score, I never did find out where they went. I also wish their were more customazion like maybe ramps or differnt styled blocks you could use in workshop levels. Which don't get me wrong this game is fantastic but higher ping players have a hard time enjoying multiplayer.

Don't worry if you have a hard time with it. Everyone does, but everyone always goes back to it. The levels are made differently for two players that add a little more of a challenge. Either way it's fun. While Castle Crashers is massively more fun with friends, this game is good on its own.\n\nPros:\n-Challenging, but addictive.\n-Super cute art style\n-Fantastic music!\n-Narrator is hilarious. The opening scene itself was worth the admission.\n-Custom heads!\n-You get a Hatty knight for Castle Crashers!\n-Game is easy to run on toasters.

He never played that game!? What is WRONG with him, was he dropped on his head when he was born!?" Well to answer that question simply, most likely; but if you want the real answer, it was because the lad was known to be socially unaccepted, and to be discarded from society like nothing more than a tissue used for secrety things. So then oneday our protagonist decided to get BattleBlock theature, and HO, was his life in for a spin! For only 2 HOURS, the boy heard a knock at the door, there he saw Justin Beiber at his door, looking faggy as usual. So then our protagonist punched him in the FACE! It was huge, so huge that the boy became an oscar award winning 'Justin Beiber Puncher'. Now our lad gets the ladies whenever he wants, and to call the shots on what should explode! And our friend only thanks BattleBlock Theater, because if it wasn't for the game, he would have never gotten this far! But you too can be as awesome and cool as our friend! Why, buy this game, and soon, you'll be consumed by it's awesomeness, and became the living definition of awesome!

In order to complete a level you need to adleast get Three gems. But if you want bonus points get the rest of em inorder to gain more gems. Almost each level there is a yarn ball(there kinda secret to find but some are easy) after you complete 3 levels in a chapter it will take you outside where you have 2 options either got to the next level/chapter or you could spend your gems and yarn for heads and weapons. to get a Head it costs 10 Gems and the Weapons cost 5 Yarn balls.\nAlso there are other gamemodes in the game to. such as VS or co-op where you can go 1v1 or 2v2 or even 2v1.\nThe main story can also be co-op But teamwork is always requierd in this.\n\nSo i hope my review has help you alot and enjoy playing :)","July 6, 2014","true","3.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Besides basic controls, it's up to the player to figure out how to play. Personally, this adds depths to all games. If you can play a game, get better at it only because it makes you better by observing and trying first hand, it's probably got a better shot than those that don't.

I haven't played singleplayer very much so I can't tell much about it. So don't buy this if you are playing only Singleplayer\n\nMULTIPLAYER The CO-OP multiplayer is really funny to do with friends some levels are really hard! The voice over is f**king brilliant!\nI enjoyed every single piece of this multiplayer CO-OP adventure!\nThere is also an BATTLE MODE! Where you can fight the one who helped you complete the Multiplater campaign!\nYou can use you're weapons and skins and earn gems for the 100% completion!\n\nWORKSHOP The steam community workshop is something what made this game even more fun!

Oh, wait, that's three. Oh well. Did I mention it was fun? But in all seriousness, this game is really rather addicting due to its unique personality. Being a platformer, the basic gameplay style is the same: jump platform to platform and avoid death. There is combat if you so wish to kill the cat guards that try to end your fabulous jumping spree, or very little if you choose not to (though you'll miss some gems, used to unlock prisoners (new faces), for that perfect score!). There is a decent variety of melee moves and a good armory of weapons, each with different effects both harmful and helpful. For example, the acid bubble: as the name implies, it's acidic, and you or any enemy who gets caught in it or going through it is killed; however you can jump on top of it and bounce off to reach new heights for some more gems or maybe the ever-so-precious yarn, used to unlock weapons. The silly storyline (it involves a boat of friends appropriately called the S.S. Friendship) and annoying-but-not-in-a-bad-way narrator are enough to motivate you through the solo campaign, though the option of the co-op campaign (same storyline, new levels) is really rather tempting, and is rewarding. Both players earn all gems and yarn earned in every level, except for the mysterious, shiny, golden hat, which keeps a slightly competetive feel to it, even though you're best friends now! There are separate achievements for beating the game on normal difficulty, co-op normal, insane, and co-op insane, so there are reasons to replay it, besides being outstandlingly fun that is. And once you tire of the storyline (or at the very least want a break, because who can ditch Hatty? Nobody, that's who.) there are several different "arena" modes and the exclusive features to play through. Arena games (including King of the Hill and a silly form of Basketball) offer a competetive PvP side while the Furbottom Features offer more co-op rewards and player integration through the Steam Workshop. There is a level editor of course, meaning that you can endlessly spawn new challenges for you and your friends or to listen to the tears of the other players who don't realize you put some invisible block somewhere (I don't think that's possible, and if it is...don't be heartless, we're all friends here). If you're not big into silly, happy, carefree, happy-go-lucky-e-t-c. games, well, deal with it, because this game is worth every penny you'll spend on it. It's a good platformer with incentives to replay and to do more than just the campaign, and I suppose you could mute it, if you're masochisitic. Another valuable point I think is worth mentioning is that this is a semi-popular game, and it's on Steam with an interactive community and game developers (Chicken Toucher achievement anybody?) so this game has really good potential of being updated frequently. With a base game already worth the full price and more, additional content really pushes it over the edge. Hope to see you on!","May 24, 2014","true","37.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This game is the best co-op game I've played, ever. The trailers are what led me to the game in the first place and Stampers narration will win you over immediately with it's goofy humor. The game has lots and lots of it. So I got it, and started playing it with my friends.\n\nFirst thing I noticed is that the music is amazing. It's the kind of music that you search for later on youtube just to listen it on your time off from Battleblock Theatre. Then we started playing. While the campaign is co-op the game allows you to screw over your partner at every opportunity which is encouraged by quick respawns and various hilarious ways to cause your friends demise. The levels are wonderfully designed, containing exceedingly cleverer puzzles and traps and more and more different situations to fail with laughter. The controls are precise and once you get good, you can pull off stuff you wouldn't believe. If that isn't yet enough, there are arena gamemodes which all feel different and polished as well from basketball to king of the hill to capture the horse. Then there are extra levels. Then there are the levels made by other players. Then there is the level editor.\n\nThis game has made me laugh more then any other coop game and I've played a lot of them. Do yourself a favor and check this game out.","March 8, 2015","true","19.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If you play it alone you will at least have 20-30 hours of gametime. If you try to get all the achievements you will have 50-100 hours of mixed feelings (happines, sadness, anger, pride, etc.). If you have friend that play the game you can have up to 200 hours of fun. Game mechanics are really good and it has a easy learning curve. When you pass the story you can go replay it for achievements and if you get bored with the story there are a lot of community levels. If you have a friend/s to play the game with you there is a co-op story and there are community maps aswell for co-op. There is an Arena with 8 different modes and you can play up to 4 players. If you ever get bored with the game there is a level editor that you should try out, its really easy to build levels.\n\nThe only thing I was dissapointed with is that there are not a lot of players online, but that not a big deal because you can play with bots.\n\nSo to end this review I would recomend this game 100%.

This game may not have really won every game of the year award ever, but by gum it deserves it! Where to start?\n\nWilliam Stamper.\n\nI have always been a fan of Stamper's humour and when I heard he had done the naration on a game I was blown away. But that's not the reason why I had to throw all my money at it.\n\nGameplay.\n\nThe controls were responsive and easy to learn, for a title that was ported from xbox, my logitech controller has yet to misfire (hem hem, Darksiders COUGH!)\n\nCustomizability (do you even into the english language?).\n\nFrom changing my colour to the shape of my head, I was able to make the perfect prisoner, but I find myself changing my head daily JUST BECAUSE I CAN!\n\nStory.\nI was in tears, THE PLIGHT OF HATTY IS STILL FRESH IN MY HEART AND MIND!\n\nMultiplayer\nIf, like me, you're tired of the moaning "MLG PROS" on tf2 mix servers, then my son it's time for a change. If you enjoyed super smash bros, feel free to try at the game mode of the same name (don't you quote on me that) I had a righteous giggle, molesting two other players because my team mate "lost connection"\n\nVerdict\n\n11/10 would play again, if only to hear Stamper cry "NO!

Oh hell yes I would, are you kidding me. I never actually heard of BattleBlock Theater until I had a friend who told me that this game was coming out for the PC, and so I was curious about this game and decided to find out more about this game. Just watching the trailer for this game alone got me hooked on the game, but what got me even more interested about this game was the voice actor that doing all of the hilarious remarks. Since I actually knew about Stamper before I ever found out about this game I admired Stamper for his voice, cause his voice is pretty Godly, if you ask me.... I wish I could speak like that. Never the less when I had figured out that Stamper was the voice actor for this game I was absolutely thrilled about this cause it would be hours upon hours of listening to Stamper's voice constantly mocking you as die absolutely hilarious deaths. But enough about the voice acting, I'll get back to the rating of that later. To continue, the graphics on this game was in my opinion very good and very fitting for this game the layout style or genre of this game also was very fitting which does play into the story quite a bit in all honesty. So in the end I would deffinetly give this game 10/10 in graphics. Now the game mechanics I can't complain about what-so-ever, so 10/10 in game mechanics and style and so on and so forth you get the idea by now I hope. The story, oh the story. I love the story and with Stamper doing all of the voice overs you simply can't go wrong with this game's story and the humor tops it all so I would totally give this story a 10/10, which overall rating of this game would have to deffinetly be a 10/10. So back to my original question, would I recomend this game? Of course I would yet again, now in my opinion is it the best game I have ever played? Not really, but it would totally be my second favorite game that I have played (first one being FTL and third one being The Binding of Isaac). In my opinion it's just one of those games that sparks memories of me being 8 years old and playing Metroid Fussion on my Nintendo GameBoy Advance SP and constantly raging at that one dammed spider boss for some reason. But enough about my memories, just go get the game and as always, enjoy your experience.","June 22, 2014","true","12.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

And they are all cats.\n\nSingle Player story is introduced through simple story-cutscenes after every chapter, using narrator. This narrator will often speak during the game, usually saying something hilarious... Whole game is constructed to be funny. The point of every level is to grab as many diamonds, as you can and get to the exit. In your way will be deadly spikes, hostile cats and... more random obstacles. Story also allows co-op mode. Even though most level are in coop slightly modified, it brings very different experience. Everything is more fun with friends, right?\n\nBesides story mode, there is arena, that contains many PvP modes like King of the Hill, Capture the Horse and more - not just made by developers, but also player-made. There are also player-made adventure playlists. Multiplayer can be played locally or online, which is currently weaker, but you can usually find some games.\n\nStory mode and official arena maps will earn you diamonds and yarns, which you can use to buy new head skins and weapons. These can be later traded with real players, directly ingame.\n\nGame also has its ingame level editor, where you can make your own maps of any type - adventure playlist or arena.\n\n+ Local Co-op\n+ Narrator\n+ Level Editor\n\n- Weak (but alive) online Multiplayer\n\nThis game brought many laugh-hard moments and its always well wasted time. :D\n9/10","June 18, 2015","true","274.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The Behemoth really knows how to make a fun game with lots of characteristics like the interesting story, lots of levels, cosmetics (no DLC, just in-game currency), jokes, and everything their games have.\n\nPros:\n- An amazing game to play in Co-op with a friend/your girlfriend, or against two other persons (Custom made match, or even searching an Open Public game)\n- The community is really kind and the players are funny and cool to play with.\n- You have an interesting Trade system in-game to trade your diamonds/faces for something you like/want from other players.\n- Each level has it's own challenge, where you can Co-op with your friend, try to kill him in a funny way, or simply try again and again until you complete it.\n- With near players, the lagg is almost none. Really well made for network gameplay.\n\nCons:\n- I had some problems playing with 3 friends Local against 1 other friend Online. There is a restriction of 2/4 players in the same computer that might bring troubles to uneven players, but it works perfectly when inviting from Steam.\n\nScore: 10/10, a must have for all the players that love Co-op, funny challenges and annoying friends with friendly fire :P","July 15, 2015","true","15.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Coming into the game having watched a few videos on it, I'd thought it would have been a nice time to just fool around and murder your friends and whatnot. I got that, but what I had expected should have been more. I underestimated just how fun the game was.\n\nYou're given tight controls, clean and art that is very good to look at. The music fits the game very well and for me, personally, much like Newgrounds music does. I've found myself rather focused on the game itself to even notice the music, and when I do, Stamper's off, meowing a few times, or something. It's humourous, it's comical, the cutscenes are done in a pesudo-puppet show fashion and pulls out plenty of fun visual gags.\n\nThe level design works very well for the platforming-puzzle mechanic is has going on, and each level seemingly has those optimal designs which makes killing your friends a breeze.\n\nThe weapon seem simple at first, but they can be used to bend the game or make certain aspects easier, considering you're skilled enough to use them, which can make speedrunning much more viable.\n\nIf you are going to play this game, however, Grab a Friend, and preferably one who is perfectly fine with dying a few times by your hands, and willing to do the same! It keeps things fun, the air light, and you'll be smiling and laughing all the way.","May 18, 2014","true","49.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

So, now it's been released on Steam a year later, and I completely believe that it was worth the wait. I appreciate the amount of love and effort was put into this game, and making it unlike any other game I've played (yes, it's a platformer, but it's more than that). The only thing I can criticize is the amount of players on the "Online" mode. This might just be because people are in Private Lobbies, but I'm not sure. Even if that's not the case, it has nothing to do with the quality of the game.\n\nThe storyline is fantastic (in my opinion) and it shows character (just like Castle Crasher's did, but with actual narration. Probably more so.). I enjoyed the narrator (StampyTV) throughout the entire game, and laughed a bit each time he had something to say. The multiplayer is great. Unlike their previous title (Castle Crashers), Battleblock Theater has many more gamemodes (both Co-op and competitive). All of them are fairly entertaining. I highly encourage any fans of Castle Crashers or platformers to take a look at this game, and perhaps buy it if they haven't already!","May 17, 2014","true","28.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Feels very organic and freshly aired. Fast paced. Makes you twitch you Angus as you try to make leaps of faith in the brink of a second. Complemented by an Announcer that makes you feel warm and cared for in the scenery of a muppets movie. Not to mention the online action you can have with replaceable human specimen to join you in shared anguish in the hunt for jewels.\n\nCums with a shipload of levels and most importantly colletable hats and heads for leathal hatshots.

RIGHT?\n\ni was right.\nI knew i made the right decision as soon as i started playing.\nnow something about the game itself:\nThe game is story-driven, but plays in separate levels accessible from a hub.\nThe story is delivered in a funny way and has a real good flow to it. you can play in story mode in singleplayer, as well as in multiplayer. multiplayer can be played cooperatively as well as against eachother in arena mode, so there's enough choice there.\nthe one thing i could complain about is how the levels start looking the same after a while, but that's just a minor complaint because they more than make up for it with the other elements in the game, including the level editor (did i mention there's a level editor?)\n\nAll in all, a nice game with action as well as platforming fun, but it could get boring after a while for an avid gamer.","June 22, 2014","true","7.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"
