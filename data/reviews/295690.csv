"http://steamcommunity.com/id/epilexia/recommended/295690/","epilexia","Epilexia","http://steamcommunity.com/id/epilexia/","691 products in account","Particle Mace is a masterful lesson in game design that with its perfect scoring system and haunting beautiful abstract world will put you in some sort of hypnotic trance. While you leave your mind behind you, tracing circles like in a Sufi whirling dance ritual. One of the most captivating game experiences since Tetsuya Mizoguchi‚Äôs Rez, that gives a true meaning to the expression videogames as an art form\nIn my first 5 minutes with Particle Mace, I wasn‚Äôt so impressed. Sure, the main mechanic was original and a brilliant twist respect to the typical twin stick shooter. But I wasn‚Äôt able to understand why it was the favorite game for some of my most beloved friends. But after I spent half an hour with it, when I dominated its psychics mechanics and I understood its scoring system realizing the masterful and completely perfect game design behind it, I became anxious.\n\nI felt my pulse accelerated with each heartbeat sending unconscious signals to my mind. Full of binary coded verses talking about the overwhelming sense of beauty suspended in the abstract and almost ethereal world behind Particle Mace.\n\nIt‚Äôs the same sense of accomplishment that you can feel when you meet for the first time a lifetime love, this person who you will spend some of your more pleasant and intimate moments. Sometimes this tempestuous love will induce you to obfuscation, making you to feel a bit dumb about yourself for every bad step taken in your relationship, this meteor that you stupidly crashed while you were concentrated trying to evade a pursuing enemy‚Äôs red ship. But then you reconcile with it and the previously induced rage only takes you to a next and much more passionate encounter in which you have a better understanding of every particle in its body, allowing you to achieve a higher score.\n\nSometimes, Particle Mace is a meditative experience that puts you in some sort of state of trance while you are tracing circles at a constant pace that flows like a mantra. An experience similar to a Sufi whirling dance ritual in which the participants are able to elevate his minds from his bodies through the constant act of swirling with the rhythm of the music.\n\nAt other times, Particle Mace turns into a fast pace and frantic arcade experience with the screen inundated with menacing objects floating in the vastness of space. And you feel inside of a space opera, while you maneuver your ship tracing impossible parables. Creating complex strategies to destroy the enemy ships, trying to not lose the momentum while you increase even more an epic chain of explosions.\n\nIt has a perfectly crafted level design, that like Nintendo‚Äôs most beloved classics, works on a two-dimensional level of complexity. There is a first layer in the game that makes it instantly pleasant to play only to be absorbed in its universe, being an experience close to meditation and with a main mechanic that is instantly fun. And then comes with its second layer of complexity, because the better you learn its level structure, scoring system and enemies patterns, the more you can improve your runs in a competitive way. In each run you can feel your progress, how you have a better knowledge of the game rules every time. At the end, destroying the enemies becomes an instinctive reflex skill.\n\nParticle Mace is a game almost eternal. Its three main infinite modes are truly differentiated among them. Each mode has a completely different layout with a diverse range of challenges that can immensely alter the gameplay. And every layout is in a constant change. The more you score, the more new elements are included. Its level of creativity is incredible, slowly introducing new ideas, patterns and obstacles.\n\nAnd then you have a glorious 150 missions mode that constantly amazes you with new design ideas, new menaces, new rules. This mode exhibits a level of ingenuity in its construction that is on par with the constant sense of surprise and novelty found in each of the levels of Super Mario Galaxy. With Particle Mace, Andy Wallace reveals himself as one of the better videogame designers of his generation.\n\nAnd all of this is embraced with one of the most beautiful and evocative abstract worlds seen since Tetsuya Mizoguchi‚Äôs Rez. The game is enveloped by a special sense of loneliness, an intense feeling of melancholy and introspection that can let us spend hundred of hours in it, while we‚Äôre absorbed in a universe constructed via suspended and ethereal backgrounds. A feeling that is intensified thanks to a hypnotic soundtrack that rises in a perfect crescendo to highlight the most action packed moments.\n\nParticle Mace is one of these games that like Rez years before, makes that you couldn‚Äôt conceive a single hard work day that not end in feeling for a mere instant its abstract beauty while you are immersed in the still of the night. Captivating your soul and showing you the true meaning of the expression videogames as an art form.\n\n\n( The writer of this review is not an English native. So you should expect occasional grammar errors. I apologize in advance. )","October 22, 2015","true","8.1"," 83 of 92 people (90%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","90","83","92","10","8"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CueZero/recommended/295690/","CueZero","CueZero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CueZero/","1640 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nPARTICLE MACE is a frantic blast of space trash smash'emup action where you will spin it to win it. The elegant movements of your ship are like a ballet of geometrical anarchy. In the same way that games like Nidhogg bring the local multiplayer insanity to the platforming brawler genres, PARTICLE MACE brings the same level of abstract and chaotic couch co-op to the action arcade genre.\n\nThe controls and the physics revolving around your cluster of tethered space garbage really hit the nail on the head. There's a serious feeling of weight to the mace you're swinging around as you swerve to each side trying to get it's momentum going, and when you do it feels very natural. There are different ships of different speeds to accommodate each and every play style, ranging from the super slow ship with a large and effective particle mace to the extremely fast and speedy ship with a longer and harder to control mace.\n\nGetting into the groove of the game is a very zen-like experience, becoming lost in the motions of your ship weaving in and out of clusters of asteroids. The movement of your chosen ship feels incredibly fluid and responsive, giving you the edge you need to navigate through the narrowest of passages in-between asteroids and your intimidating red foes.\n\nThe multiplayer co-op is where PARTICLE MACE really shines as it isn't just the simple addition of new players on the screen, but features some discoverable techniques like the combining of Maces or the revival of fallen teammates floating by helplessly which will require the full coordination of each participating player.\n\nEven in it's early stages there's already a whole slew of really great modes and options you would expect from a polished full release, including the progressive mission mode which dishes out a series of unique and increasingly harder tasks to take on  that will earn you new ships, √† la Luftrausers. Although seemingly simple on the surface, PARTICLE MACE is a huge game with incredible polish and an almost infinite learning curve, making this one hell of an addictive ride to pick up and play for the shortest bursts of play to the longest couch co-op jam sessions.","September 19, 2014","true","18.6"," 31 of 38 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","31","38","0","1"

The game mechanics are deceptively simple: use any stick on your gampad to move your spaceship in any direction. The weights attached to the lines will then accelerate (rotate around you if you do it right) and smash things; but don't try that with your ship, because then you will be smashed. There are few different setups of spaceship mass, speeds and weight/line arrangements, and some do require different tactics. I tried this game out in local MP (it seats 4 players, though we tried it with two), and it really shines there: co-op is well done, and death match is fun, especially if you're using different ship types. I'm not certain I can say the same for the single-player "campaign", which comes down to doing 150 mini-"missions" (aka achievements); consider it "practice mode".\n\nImmediately awesome.

You know how sometimes you're just looking for a good, cheap game that you can sink your teeth into right away without having to think too much about it? A game that has an interesting new mechanic and is instantly addictive? This is that game. It takes about five seconds to learn the basics, and then it grabs you--that whole whip-the-mace-at-rocks-and-ships thing.\n\nFor those who don't know: Imagine chunks of space junk tethered (by bungie cords) to an agile spaceship. The trick is to, with a single thumbstick, use the ship's momentum and direction to fling those tethered chunks like a mace and pulverize asteroids and enemy ships. (Yes, there is a local, four-player muiltiplayer mode.) It's simply divine.\n\nWhile it is inspired by arcade classics, it instantly sets itself apart. There's a whole lot of variety here for just a few bucks. This is that game you'll play as your warm-up for a marathon session of some bigger, grander game. Only...you'll probably look up after a few hours and realize that you spent all your time flinging the PARTICLE MACE.\n\nWARNING: Like a lot of folks, I was disappointed about the lack of Steam Controller support.

There are 3 levels (normal, hard, astroid) to play for your highest score, and the gameplay is fun enough to keep you trying for a little bit.  There are ships with different characteristics to unlock, which change how you might play the levels.  And what keeps me engaged are the 150 missions that vary things up to meet some objective, like kill 5 enemies within a circle around the starting point, or kill a certain number of astroids, or don't kill anything for a certain amount of time, etc.  There is a decent amount of variety to the missions, and then they increase the mission level.  This is a surprisingly competent game.  I am very happy that I gave this a shot.\n\nPlays great on my Windows 10 Alienware Alpha on my 47" TV with an xbox360 gamepad.","April 17","true","4.4"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

Still in early access, but lots on enjoyment to be had. It fills a "quick, easy, twin-stick-ish, unique arcade game" hole that I had in my heart/library.\nPros:\n-The controls are very tight and the "mace" responds as expected\n-Good variation "ships"\n-Game modes are entertaining: easy, hard, asteroid field, challenges\n-Unlocks give you something to strive for if a new high score is not enough.\n-And unlock goals are set well; high, but not too high.\n-Music is atmospheric and fits nicely.\n-The sounds and graphics make it feel retro, but still polished.\n-Leaderboads makes a lot of sense\n-The gameplay keeps you coming back to do better / change strategies / destroy all the things. "just one more time"\n-Have not tried multiplayer yet\n-Developers hosted a high score competition with prizes! How cool is that!\n-On mac so even my silly iFriends can play too.\n-Great pricepoint!\n\nPossible improvements:\n-Other game modes could be added for further variety (time attack/pacifism)\n-Could add some customization for difficulty/ease multipliers: set number of particles/asteroid density/enemy strength/ etc.\n-An "adventure" mode to pick up more particles/ gain shields/ pseudo bosses?\n-Power ups?\n\nExcited to see what is yet to come! 8/10\n","September 23, 2014","true","2.2"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","11","12","0","0"

However there is no volume bar to turn it lower or higher. Only ON or OFF.\nYou can play this game in fullscreen or windows mode. However there is no resolution size available.\nThere is Color Blind Mode.\nYou can play this game with a Xbox controller.\nThere are Several game modes availables. Arcade(Survival+Endless mode), Co-op Arcade, Deathmatch and 150 missions/Levels.\nThis is Local Co-op up to 4 players.\n\nAbout the game.\nYou play with a ship that has a wrecking ball around him. You have to move your ship in order to move the wrecking ball. You will have to kill targets with your wrecking ball by swinging it around. While the game is easy to understand with easy controls, It isn't easy to hit objects with the wrecking ball. Sometimes this could be even frustating too. But the game idea is totally there.  There are like 150 missions with each of their own objective. Like "kill this within 5 secs" or "stay here for 15 secs" and so go on.\n\nGame controls are good.\nMusic is alright.\nGraphics is okay.\nHitbox is perfectly accurate.\nThere is a small tutorial.\nThere is a difficulty settings.\nLocal Co-op up to 4 players. (Xbox controller required)\n\nOther things.\nAlot of colorful objects. If it starts to hurt your eyes, then turn on the color blind mode.\n\n-------------------\n\nI Give this game a 6/10\n","April 8","true","4.5"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/recommended/295690/","atratzu","Atratzu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/","180 products in account","-Quick Review-\nPARTICLE MACE is an indie-2d-space-ship game that plays like "asteroids", only instead of going pew pew, you go swish swish, you swing particles behind your ship to smash asteroids and enemy ships.\n\n\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory: There isn't much of a developed story, supposedly everyone is dead and now you're the only survivor in a ship trying to survive. (Good thing they let me respawn though. Because if I didn't get to respawn all hope would be lost because this game take a bit of getting used too)\n\nGameplay: PARTICLE MACE was inspired by old classic video games, ergo it feels very much like a classic video game. While still very challenging and difficult, the game feels far more playable then classic video games because this game can actually be beat! (props to all of you classic video game deities, we all want to be like you, only with a real life too.)\nAs I have already eluded too, you don't have laser ‚Äúpew pew‚Äù weapons, instead you have pixels holding on to the back of your ship for dear life, you need to use these ‚Äúparticles‚Äù to smash into objects to do damage for you. As the game itself says ‚Äúyou use these games like a Mace‚Äù Thus the name ‚ÄúPARTICLE MACE‚Äù.\n\nThere are a few different game modes; Missions, Asteroids, Easy, and hard. Each game mode plays a little differently.\nPersonally I enjoyed trying to finish the Missions the most, you always have 3 different missions that you can try to accomplish in one attempt, or just get one of them and it'll shuffle to a new mission.\nThe game mode "Asteroids" is what it sounds like, you just have asteroids that you're up against, however it is definitely just as tough as any of the other game modes.\nEasy, supposedly an ‚Äúeasier‚Äù arcade version of the game, quite honestly I can't tell; it's one hit and you're dead with all but one ship.\nHard, supposedly a ‚Äúharder‚Äù arcade version of the game, quite honestly I can't tell; it's one hit and you're dead with all but one ship.\n\nThere  are also a number of ships you can unlock and play as, some move faster, some have bigger Particles dragging behind them, others have other advantages. All in all, there isn't much to say about the ships without giving away some of the few surprises within the game. In the end I found myself using only one or two of the different unlocked ships.\n\nLastly, there's Local Co-op, I wish it was online multiplier, I have a tough enough time joining my steam friends in game (lining up my free time with someone else's) having a friend come over and play on the same machine as me... yeah no, that unfortunately will probably never happen.\n\nAchievements: There are 21 achievements on PARTICLE MACE... none of which are easily obtained. After my first play through I had a total of none of them (that's 5 hours of playing... with no achievements. Any other achiever would flinch after hearing that)\nThere are four types of achievements in this game: Single Player, Co-op, Mastery and Grind. About 13 achievements are able to be earned on your own, 7 achievements earned in Co-op (Aye dn't haz N-E frnds, stahp mak'n meh mahke frnds), 1 achievement for doing everything, and out of those 21 achievements, at least half of those achievements require extensive grinding.\n\nPrice: PARTICLE MACE is priced at $4.99 for 5 hours of entertainment out of the game. (so far, 08/03/15, I have a lot of grinding to do before I'm ready to give up.) All in all, that's a fair price. Even if you're tight on money, I always feel good about recommending indie games.\n\nConclusion: I recommend PARTICLE MACE to gamers who enjoy playing older games, or are just looking for a change of pace. Unless you're an achievement hunter this game won't take very long to play through the missions and finish.","August 10, 2015","true","8.4"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

While my clocked hours may not seem significant, trust me when I say I've played this game A LOT outside of steam.\n\nPARTICLE MACE is an arcade game that you can pick up and play in seconds. The only input is movement. That's it. You only press buttons in the menu. This makes for an easy to learn, difficult to master experience... gamer or not. It's great to play alone, and even better to play with friends.\n\nPart of why I love this game is how refined the movement is. PM doesn't try to be anything other than a rad arcade game. It doesn't stretch itself too thin, choosing instead to be a surgical strike of awesome. You want to top the charts on the high score list, or you want to destroy your friends by elegantly weaving through every obstacle and hitting that PERFECT swing of the mace into lesser players. You won't find branching dialogue, super crazy 3D graphics, or dozens of intricate maps. What you will find is an environment you think you've mastered, only to realize (either by high scores or deathmatch) that you aren't anywhere near as great as you thought you were. Killed by a stray asteroid? You failed. Dodge it next time. This is what PARTICLE MACE is.\n\nThe ships all change the way you move / play in a meaningful and drastic way, which really made me eager to unlock and try them all. The music is amazing (again, friends with the composer), and the game is really nice to look at. The background is awesome to look at. While it can be played on damn near everything, I prefer the controller. If you live in the NYC area, track down the actual arcade cabinet for the best experience.","September 19, 2014","true","1.3"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","11","17","0","0"

The game feels great and is very satisfying to play. The controls are polished and intuitive, the physics of the mace weapon are easy to learn, but there's clearly a high skill ceiling for tricks and techniques. Enemies, obstables, and level have simple and easy to read designs, very well done.\n\nIn spite of how easy the game is to learn the missions (meta objectives) add a surpising amount of depth. For instance, some require you to limit movement or avoid killing things for a period of time. This challenges you to alter your style of play to complete a goal and think tactically rather than turn off your brain.\n\nI can't say how the game feels over a longer period time but the core mechanics are very well polished. You can pick this up and play it for just a few minutes and get quite a bit of enjoyment out of it. I feel like the psychological rewards in the core game loop are capable of making longer play sessions enjoyable too. I definitely recommended this if you like physics-based gameplay and/or bullet hell shooter types, and don't suffer from epilepsy.","September 29, 2014","true","2.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

The concept of the game is simple. Don't let your ship get hit by the meteors, ships, and other enemies around you, while staying inside your designated zone. Around you there are multiple "particles" attached to your ship. Your goal is to move around, and maneuver the particle so that they hit (and destroy) all of those nasty little meteors and what I can only assume are alien ships. The physics in the game are absolutely amazing as well, seeing as all of the particles pretty much revolve around them.\n\nAlso, just so that the game does not begin to get boring early on, you have extra ships to unlock, with varying amounts of particles, and speed. Not only are there added ships, but there are also multiple missions that you are assigned or tasked with completing.\n\nThis game is absolutely amazing, and most definitely worth those ten dollars!","March 7","true","0.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The game controls just like every other twin stick shooter out there but instead of using the other stick to pick a direction to fire, you must master inertia to swing around a handful of tethered particles in order to strike down the enemies. There are several ship variants to unlock and each handle markedly differently but all feel wonderful and responsive to pilot. In addition, there are also many modifiers applied to the the tethers in the ‚ÄúMission‚Äù mode to mix things up a bit.\n\nOn the subject of modes, there are 4 total of which I have only dabbled in two of them. I didn‚Äôt try out coop or deathmatch but I spent extensive time with the arcade (survival) and mission modes. The arcade has 3 endless difficulties-easy, hard and asteroid only-and they scale remarkably well as time passes and you begin to rack the points up. The mission mode constantly cycles through objectives and conditions to meet and is a blast to work through. Unfortunately, this can get rather frustrating because you may get assigned 3 very conflicting quests at once and they each can hinder the others from being completed. It would be really nice to be able to pass on a mission temporarily when it‚Äôs causing trouble. However, Particle Mace is still a blast to play despite this quirk as the Arcade mode provides more than enough challenge and replayability.\n\nI was honestly not expecting much booting it up, but I‚Äôm so glad to have discovered this little gem.","September 19, 2015","true","19.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The mechanics are pretty straight forward: you have these tethers attached to the back of your ship which you must use to smash asteroids and kill foes (usually little red things that pursue you).\nIt starts off fairly easy and gradually gets more difficult, the foes also seem to increase in complexity.\n\nIt is such a relaxing and wonderful experience playing this game. You will probably find yourself replaying it over and over in a single setting to try and beat your/ friends high scores, or to do the 150 challenges. There is immense replayability here.\n\nI originally bought this to farm for trading cards but found myself unable to stop playing. I discovered you can unlock a large number of ships by accomplishing various objectives. All of the ships I have unlocked so far are all quite diverse and have their own pro's and con's (my favorite currently being the Catalyst).\n\nThe soundtrack is also really lovely and relaxing.\n\nDo yourself a favour and grab this game, it's so cheap right now and you won't regret it!","August 4, 2015","true","3.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I get that 8 way keyboard movement wouldn't be as smooth as an analog stick, but don't force people to use a mouse, especially when you don't constrain the mouse movement in any way. Far too often my mouse wanders off onto the other screen and I find myself unable to move in any direction that isn't left.","February 25","false","0.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I wouldn't recommend it personally but if you're a fan of arcade games, go for it.","March 7","false","0.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

This is my first review, but I'll try to be as informative as I can to try and help you make your decision of either to buy or not buy this game. :D\n\nTo buy or not to buy... that is the question.\n\nFYI: I'm writing this only after having the game for one day... I actually just purchased it today.\n\nPros/Cons:\n\nPros:\n-Cheap!\n-Not a shooting game! (not sure if that's considered a pro, but just letting you know)\n-The pro above this one rhymed\n-Addicting\n-150 missions\n-Arcade-style (which I'm guessing you must like if you're even considering this game. :P)\n-Many different unlockable ships with their own unique traits, try to collect 'em all!\n\nCons:\n-Not really a multiplayer game (you can play in multiplayer but then you'd all have to be sitting in front of the same computer, and don't quote me on this but I'm 99% sure multiplayer requires a controller)\n-No way to get rid of the border around the area where you're allowed to travel, meaning that you are always stuck in that little space.  There's no option for an unlimited world, so you are always stuck within the restraints of that border.  Just something that bugs me a little.  Just a little.\n-The soundtrack isn't included with the game.  You have to purchase it separately.  This is my first time encountering this so I'm not sure if it's common practice, but something I didn't like.\n-Graphics are well... arcade-like.  But it's an arcade style game, so...\n\n----------\nOverview\n----------\n\nYou're a small, tiny ship stuck in the middle of space.  You have no weapons except some orange trash particles attached by strings to your ship.  You must maneuver your ship around to get the trash particles to hit the asteroids and other enemies.  Your enemies are the red shapes, which, unlike the asteroids, will actually aim for you.  In mission mode, you can try and complete various challenges.  In arcade mode, there are no preset challenges, so you just try to top your previous high score.  There are 3 different difficulties, 4 if you count tutorial mode: Easy, Hard, and Asteroid.  Easy and hard are pretty self-explanatory, while asteroids has no enemies in it, only asteroids.  There's also 2 different multiplayer modes, but I can't say much for those because I'm unable to play them due to a lack of controllers.  Overall, I would definitely reccomend this game to anyone with time to spare and prefers a strategy, arcade style game over a violent shooting game.  If what you've been reading sounds like your cup of tea, then I'd definitely reccomend you pick this game up.  It's worth the money, although I did get mine for 53 cents as it is on a 92% discount as of this moment (39 cents for the game, 14 cents for the soundtrack).\n\nThanks for reading my first ever game review! :D Hope I helped you with your decision.  If you have any questions, just let me know.\n\n-CommanderClasher\n\nOh, almost forgot to mention- the narrator (not really a narrator because they talk using text, but I digress) isn't your typical boring narrator.  I was very entertained by their "well, you're screwed" type of attitude.","August 4, 2015","true","2.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Just a little.\n-The soundtrack isn't included with the game.  You have to purchase it separately.  This is my first time encountering this so I'm not sure if it's common practice, but something I didn't like.\n-Graphics are well... arcade-like.  But it's an arcade style game, so...\n\n----------\nOverview\n----------\n\nYou're a small, tiny ship stuck in the middle of space.  You have no weapons except some orange trash particles attached by strings to your ship.  You must maneuver your ship around to get the trash particles to hit the asteroids and other enemies.  Your enemies are the red shapes, which, unlike the asteroids, will actually aim for you.  In mission mode, you can try and complete various challenges.  In arcade mode, there are no preset challenges, so you just try to top your previous high score.  There are 3 different difficulties, 4 if you count tutorial mode: Easy, Hard, and Asteroid.  Easy and hard are pretty self-explanatory, while asteroids has no enemies in it, only asteroids.  There's also 2 different multiplayer modes, but I can't say much for those because I'm unable to play them due to a lack of controllers.  Overall, I would definitely reccomend this game to anyone with time to spare and prefers a strategy, arcade style game over a violent shooting game.  If what you've been reading sounds like your cup of tea, then I'd definitely reccomend you pick this game up.  It's worth the money, although I did get mine for 53 cents as it is on a 92% discount as of this moment (39 cents for the game, 14 cents for the soundtrack).\n\nThanks for reading my first ever game review! :D Hope I helped you with your decision.  If you have any questions, just let me know.\n\n-CommanderClasher\n\nOh, almost forgot to mention- the narrator (not really a narrator because they talk using text, but I digress) isn't your typical boring narrator.  I was very entertained by their "well, you're screwed" type of attitude.","August 4, 2015","true","2.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I felt that I had failed as a gamer for not having known this existed till I got it for ¬£0.13.\n\nIf you like twin stick shooters you will like this "single stick swinger". Take an asteroids/arena shooter and use what skills you've learned from more traditional games and flail around pressing buttons not really getting it. A few more deaths and it's sinking in and before long you are tearing around as you would in most shooters but applying as best you can a really cool and totally fresh feeling mechanic.\n\nThe long story short is you are dragging balls behind your ship on stretchy string and you play a hectic game of homicidal swingball. The mission structure is really cool. You are tasked with 3 objectives per life, like "get a multi kill in 12 seconds" and "get 4 kills without destroying any asteroids". If you die, the missions you didn't complete roll over and the ones you did get replaced. There isn't a great deal of variance in backdrops as far I could see but this kind of thing doesn't need vajazzling. It really thrives on the mechanics and if you are the kind of person that likes blowing stuff up and scoring points, you would be the mental not to get it.","November 1, 2015","true","7.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It may be not the most graphically impressive game, or the most complicated game ever. But it is fun. It is very fun. In this game you're a ship with a mace behind you, and you use that mace to kill the other ships trying to ram into you, but on top of that you have to worry about crashing into asteroids, because you're constantly surrounded by them. On top of this their is also missions which are small objectives you complete to progress onward, but while you complete the missions, the level has a slight twist to it like it's been generated with a few things thrown in. You'll have missions where you won't get to kill anything for 25 seconds, missions where you must go to the marked locations, missions where you must smash asteroids at a fast rate. What I'm saying basically is that it's a fun little game that constantly throws new ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• at you. Like Nintendo did when they made Mario 3. Do I recommend it. Yes, for 5$ it's not a waste at all. It's a good time waster and man it feels like time dilates for a bit. I beat 21 missions and unlocked a  new ship on hard difficulty. That took 20 minutes.

(local multiplayer, competitive and coop, as listed in the About This Game section above. I wonder why 1-player coop is given as an option? That's basically what single-player mode is, I suppose.)\n\nDetails:\nYou start with an 'average' ship. There are nine other ships that can be unlocked upon on reaching specific goals in the game. Another ship, for example, can take one extra hit before being destroyed (making two in all) but it moves more slowly and its "particles" are therefore closer to the ship and easier for me to control, based upon the number of goals I've completed using that ship when compared to the others I've unlocked. (A very nifty statistics screen lists many statistics, such as the number of goals completed, which ships you've used and how many times, the amount of points and damage done with each ship type, etc., which is where I learned what I've just stated about my better success with the slower ship. One of the ships is very fast but the particle tethers connected to your ship are much longer and more difficult to control with precision.\nYou play in an arena, which is typically a moving, rotating polygon. Asteroids and baddies move around without regard for the polygon, but contacting it with your ship will destroy your ship. In some of the timed goals, the polygon might be huge and you might only be able to reach the objective while dodging asteroids and baddies if you're flying a fast ship. Sometimes, the polygon is shaped like a cloverleaf or is a rectangle in which your ship is confined.\nBecause three goals are active at a time, sometimes they conflict, for better or for worse. For example, in order to complete a "pass through all the points marked around the arena in 30 seconds" you'll have to disregard‚Äîfor now‚Äîan also-active "stay within the marked boundary without killing anything for ## seconds". Or, you might have a goal which requires you to eliminate a large number of asteroids and another goal which requires that you reach a specific point value using only two particles. That will mean you have only two particles as long as the two-particle goal is present in the list.\nEach time you fail a goal it will be unattainable until the next mission you warp into. If you complete all of your goals your ship will warp out and you'll have three new objectives for the next mission. Any goal you complete is crossed out and will be replaced with a different goal for the next mission.\nThe variety in goals combined with having multiple goals active simultaneously adds a great deal to both the enjoyment and the replayability of Particle Mace!\nA colorblind accessibility mode is present in the game for those who have difficulty with color perception.\nParticle Mace is, in my opinion, worth its full price of $4.99 USD, but (if I didn't already own it) I'd grab it immediately at the (current, week-long (03-10 August 2015) sale price of $0.39. If you don't own PM, this 92%-off sale is a no-brainer! (Whether you'll be able to play it without a brain is another matter.)","August 5, 2015","true","2.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you get such a combo, your only option is to either play the game until you get lucky or hack the mission XML file to change the missions you're playing - neither is what I'd expect to do to complete a game.\n\nEverytime you kill an enemy the game pauses/shakes the screen.  This is fine when there are a few enemies, but when there are lots the game becomes a stutterfest and it's almost impossible to control your ship/avoid hitting stuff.\n\nWhether a controller works or not seems random - restarting sometimes fixes it.  A controller is advisable here - being able to sneak or dash is key to completing missions - so it's a pain having to restart the game a few times to make it work.\n\nSome achievements seem reluctant to unlock - most are REALLY hard so it's even more demoralising when they fail to trigger.\n\nAs I said earlier, it's a fun concept but it needs a BIT of polishing/some bugfixes and - well - doesn't seem like the developer plans to do any","December 4, 2015","false","7.1"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

To me it seemed like an updated version of Astroids. You destroy rocks and enemies through the use of a destructive tether (the mace). The tether responds to any small movement you make. Find enough room to fly your "ship" in a cricle, and it'll cause the tether to gain speed and momentum; this makes for an efficient destructive force that any astroid and red triangle would tremble by. There are 150 Missions ranging from pure point accumuluation to not destroying anything at all within a certain amount of time. It sounds and looks easier than it is. The hectic nature of the game means random chance is a bigger factor than skill. Certain moments cause needless difficulty such as a the camera shaking after a nice chain of kills.\n\nThere are several "ships" each with its own unique movement and weight. Heavier ships are slower and may hold larger particles on its tether. There are no levels, the game area changes after completing missions. You have 3 missions to complete at any one time. One area might be designed for one of those missions, but you can still complete the others in the same area. This also causes difficulty, as you might end up with a mission that was meant for an easier area, but since you've progressed past it, you'll just have to somehow finish it in a more diffcult settings. Finally; great soundtrack that works well with the visuals.\n\nThe suggested retail is $5.00. I purchased this on sale, I personally would not get it at the full price, but I'm tight with my cash. It may be be worth it to some if you're in the market for this sort of game. It is only 5 bucks!","August 13, 2015","true","4.3"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

A new mission goal will replace each goal completed in the previous round. There are 150 mission goals in all, and I'm still 27 short of finishing all of them.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GadgetGamer/recommended/295690/","GadgetGamer","GadgetGamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GadgetGamer/","669 products in account","First of all, I played this game on my netbook at 1024x600 resolution and it worked perfectly (which is handy to know because most developers never specify the minimum resolution for their games). I also used a mouse rather than a gamepad. I suspect a gamepad might be better, but the mouse is perfectly usable too.\n\nI initially didn't like this game. I started in the arcade mode and found it way too difficult to reliably control the swinging action of the trash particles that you use to smash the astroids and ships (especially without swinging myself into something else). Unlike the classic Asteroids game where you generally have plenty of space to move, it's a very crowded universe and it just made it frustrating to be able to build up momentum.\n\nHowever, the lure of trading cards made me persevere and I tried the missions. These were much more accessible than the arcade mode since it gave me just three small goals to try at a time. Rather than just keep swinging around wildly in a vain attempt to clear the level (impossible), I had to use some finesse to complete a mission and this really improved my experience. Sometimes I had to go racing around to get to certain points within a time limit so that rather than smashing the asteroids I just weaved around them like Han Solo. Other times I had to only destroy a certain number of the enemy, which can be tricky when they all group together. I learnt to let them chase me and trick them into ramming my trash. Other missions have you staying within a small area for a certain time, or destroying a particulary fast enemy ship.\n\nI still have a fair way to go in the missions, but I know that I will keep this game around once I have finished it just to have quick sessions when I find myself with a bit of spare time. Just for the sake of this review, I tried playing the arcade mode again to see how I fare this time. It was much better than my first attempt. The skills I had learnt in the missions really paid off in the arcade mode. Rather than spinning around wildly, I could do surgical strikes on any asteroid or ship that took my fancy. I am so glad I spent the time building the skills to be able to find this game such a blast!\n\nNow if you don't mind, I have just unlocked a new ship so I have to go run it through its paces.","July 8, 2015","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've only been playing the missions, so no multiplayer for me - would be nice if there was some form of online multiplayer though!\n\nThe controls are simple and feel really smooth (I use a controller).  The missions get suitably more challenging and often affect the gameplay style as they affect the environment which keeps things varied and interesting.  I really like the different ships you can get (I've unlocked 2 on top of the starter ship so far) and I like the fact that some are better for some missions than others, meaning I often switch between them rather than finding that one is too OP and using that all the time.\n\nThe only problem I had was that when you kill an enemy, the screen jolts for split second and you get a +10 on the screen (or whatever number it is) which is fine and feels really good when you kill an enemy, but when there were a fair number of enemies being killed, it sometimes made my ship a bit harder to control as it was constantly stopping and the +10s were blocking my view!\n\nI've played around 4 hrs and have completed around 130/150 challenges so I'd guess the missions part lasts around 5 total. There's also an arcade mode and multiplayer (co-op and versus) which I have yet to try.  It's a really fun game and wonderfully frustrating at times, so pick it up, play it.

The shaking is unnecessary and tough on the eyes and it makes it impossible to control the ships because you have no idea where the asteroids, the borders and your ship are while its shaking violently. There are quite a few different types of ships but most of them are worthless or have worthless features like all the mace parts clumping together at speeds necessary to keep them circling or drifing off to one side from some invisible wind and not having any snap when you need it.\n\nThe missions are pretty clever and will keep you entertained for 6 hours or so but after that I think Particle Mace has limited appeal as too much depends on luck. Definitely worth a few bucks though and no regrets that I bought it.","June 27, 2015","true","22.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When the social anxiety started to kick in, I grabbed another drink and shuffled over to where they had a few indie games set up to project against the walls, thinking that if I looked like I was engrossed in watching others play, no one would bother me.  People seemed most excited about a game that looked like some sort of colorful modern Astroids, except they were sling-shotting particles around and fighting with four players in a battle royale.  I don't really recall everything that happened that night, but at some point I had a controller in my hands and was playing Particle Mace against three others.  It was one of the most intense and fun gaming experiences I've ever had, and I somehow managed to outmanouver everyone and claim victory.\n\nYes this game is beautiful and silky-smooth fluid, but most of all it's SATISFYING.  Every time your particles smash into an astroid, enemy, or player, the game emphasises it in a way that scratches an itch I didn't know I had.\n\nA++ would recommend especially as a (drunk) couch co-op game.","December 16, 2015","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Also, I could go for a few more game modes or some sort of online play.\n\nBut I'd say this is definitely a solid $5 game.

Also, I can kinda see what they wanted to do with the 'Hyper' ship, but I think it could use a little bit of tuning.  Also, I could go for a few more game modes or some sort of online play.\n\nBut I'd say this is definitely a solid $5 game.

I've never played a game with this same inertia-based combat, but I love it. There are about 8 different ships you can unlock, each with their own advantages and disadvantages, they are pretty evenly balanced. The three different modes keep you pretty busy, with arcade ranging from easy to hard, to a special asteroids-only mode where there are no enemies, but that only makes it harder. There are 150 different challenges in challenge mode and some of them are pretty creative, such as avoiding the black hole, or destroying X amount of enemies with only two particles.\nSurprizingly enough, I love the soundtrack for this game. When you first jump into the game is has a calm, 16-bit sounding rhythm, but slowly speeds up the longer you survive, and becomes frantic as the map itself tries to kill you. I went ahead and bought the soundtrack with the game, and I am not disappointed.\nSince this game is currently $0.19, I suggest buying it right now before it goes back up to $9.99.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/recommended/295690/","Maxmetpt","Maxmetpt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/","704 products in account","Particle Mace is a neat little arcade game with a more modern approach!\n\nI'm not very into arcade or score-attack games, in general, so this is definitely not a game I can get much out of. Regardless, I think it's a pretty good game, getting quite a lot out of such a simple concept.\n\nThe gameplay is very simple: it's similar to asteroids, but instead of shooting in front of you, you have a bunch of particles tied to you by "strings". These particles kill enemies on contact, so you're trying to swing them around you while avoiding collisions.\nOne hit KO ensures pretty fast rounds, for the most part.\n\nAside from the more traditional arcade modes, where your objective is to get the highest score, you get Missions mode. In this mode, you get 3 missions to complete at any given time, out of 150. When you beat a mission, you get another, and so on. This is pretty standard, these days. But Particle Mace gets the upper hand by introducing missions with tweaks to the actual game. For some missions, there are no enemies, asteroids and much bigger, maybe the background color hides certain enemies, maybe you need to race for certain points, etc.\nThe changes are quite varied, and they mostly bring something new to an otherwise repetitive experience, focused on score alone.\n\nThese missions also unlock ships (and does scoring high on arcade modes). Unfortunately, there few ships, and most of them aren't very usable, in general. Maybe in some specific situations, but I kept using one or two of the ships 80% of the time.\nPerhaps some more manual customization (with perks) would have worked better. Of course, it would have a different balance, so yeah... The point is just that the ships didn't seem to balance towards one particular direction, but actually be more gimmicky.\n\nSo far, so good.\n\nThere are 2 problems that I have with it, though. One of them stopped me playing. The other, I think could have extended my investment in the game, but seems to be tailored towards the score-attackers, which is a shame, as it could have appealed to both!\n\nThe first is how some of the missions are conflicting with one another. Some are synergistic, but some make others almost impossible. For example, wanting to kill X enemies while having to survive for Y time without particles. You can't kil anything until you beat the latter mission... Some are more subtle, like trying to race through all the points while avoiding killing anything -- they're not mutually exclusive, but close.\nThis problem is aggravated, somewhat, by this being a physics driven game -- It's more unpredictable, leading to some undesirable situations. Nothing new, I guess.\nBut hey, overall, I thought the game was still pretty cool! Unfortunately, when I was at 137/150 missions, I had a set of two missions that made progress literally impossible.\n\nI had to survive for 60 seconds (60!) without particles. Also, I had Mega Asteroids that filled the screen. The asteroids closed in on me in less than 5 seconds. There was absolutely no path to take. It's certain death. And there's no failsafe for these situations. The only "solution" is to reset all of my progress. Yeah... no thanks.\n\nAs you can imagine, that's rather annoying. Specially with no accounting for it.\n\nThis could be solved by, for example, getting some currency for score in Mission Mode, and then using it to "re-roll" a mission into another, for example. It would be back sometime later, but you could postpone an immediate problem like this. Either that, or actually disabling a mission.\n\nSince it's impossible to make progress, I simply quit playing.\n\nThe second problem is how the achievements' bar is far, far too high. There are quite a few achievements, but they're *all* for very high scores. You can only start earning some when you've already invested time and effort into it -- sure, that may be the idea of an achievement, which I recognize. On the other hand, achievements can also be a way of keeping people interesting. For me, as I'm not a score-attacker, having some easier achievements to pursue could be good. I'd still be pursuing something, get invested, and then may even by invested enough to go for higher scores.\n\nAs is, the achievements are purely for higher level players, I guess. Not too big of a deal.\n\n\nAnyway, I've written a bit too much about this game.\nIt's neat, and it works well, for the most part. I definitely feel like 10‚Ç¨ is too much, but since the game is on sale for 19 cents, you should definitely buy it, as it is pretty fun and well made!","November 1, 2015","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When the social anxiety started to kick in, I grabbed another drink and shuffled over to where they had a few indie games set up to project against the walls, thinking that if I looked like I was engrossed in watching others play, no one would bother me.  People seemed most excited about a game that looked like some sort of colorful modern Astroids, except they were sling-shotting particles around and fighting with four players in a battle royale.  I don't really recall everything that happened that night, but at some point I had a controller in my hands and was playing Particle Mace against three others.  It was one of the most intense and fun gaming experiences I've ever had, and I somehow managed to outmanouver everyone and claim victory.\n\nYes this game is beautiful and silky-smooth fluid, but most of all it's SATISFYING.  Every time your particles smash into an astroid, enemy, or player, the game emphasises it in a way that scratches an itch I didn't know I had.\n\nA++ would recommend especially as a (drunk) couch co-op game.","December 16, 2015","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And I am not joking when I said that.\nI bought the game, thinking "It's another one of those stupid indie games, but it's 99 cents so why not."\nI played the game and I was instantly in love with it. Let me tell you why, well first off you just want to keep playing it over and over and over. Because everytime you die you just have the rather urge/rage to respond again. Not only do you keep having the urge to play it, there are challenges to do to unlock new ships for an example there is a ship called "Fast" which obviously makes you move much faster, and your "circles" move faster with you. It's just an awesome game, there is multiplayer and I reccomend you getting it on sale. ONE THING I DON'T LIKE! it's 9.99$ which, as much as I love this game and love every single detail, it's not worth the price a single bit. I just got it on sale for 99 cents. If you have the money BUY THIS GAME FROM 9.99 it's worth it when you have the money. But don't try hard on your mom to get you this game. Look, it's not game of the year and not even that popular with only a couple of hundreds of ratings and came at January of 2015, but yet again another indie game impressed me, with proper updates and updates every so then. This game is great with frequent updates and other details you'll have to find out about yourself.\n","December 17, 2015","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Reason? The missions are very creative, and it allows you to experience the different types of scenario of what the game decides to give you. The CO-OP/Deathmatch are the most fun to play with your friends, hell, as hard as the game seems when you play it on the big screen, it's very entertaining to watch everyone work together. The game supports controllers, which is pretty cool imo (but tbh, it's easier than using the mouse, however it's just preference on what your game style may be when it comes to this game) Thank goodness it was a dollar, get it while you can before it's back to ten.

Particle Mace is one of the rare games that proves the phrase correct.\n\nGraphically, Particle Mace is an obvious direct descendant of the original vectored Asteroids, just prettied up a little.  Instead of pivot-and-shoot gameplay, however, your gunless ship battles by dragging little objects around on tethers, and using inertia to swing them around.  It's a fairly simple concept, but the game keeps it from getting stale too quickly by gradually introducing variant ships with slightly different performance characteristics, and missions (challenges, really) that provide twists on the core gameplay.\n\nParticle Mace is a simple but addictive game.  Part of the secret of the addictiveness is that the game gradually gets harder, but is scrupulously fair.  It gives that "one more try" feeling because, when you die -- and you die a lot -- the death always feels like your fault.  I've yet to have a death in this game feel like the game cheated or presented an impossible situation; I always get the sense that if I'd only played a little bit better, I might have triumphed, and that draws me back for another round.","December 13, 2015","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The concept of the game is simple, you fly around dragging a bunch of weights that are smashed into enemies while trying not to crash into obstacles. It reminds me of Hammerfight quite a bit, with a dash geometry wars thrown in. It's incredibly satisfying to control, especially when you accomplish something tricky. There are a number of different ships with their own quirks and features, I really enjoyed the differences they each provided, especially in the multiplayer versus. They're not really balanced, but that hardly matters when you're playing by yourself or with friends.\n\nNo online, but local multiplayer is pretty solid if you've got people around and multiple gamepads. There aren't very many maps, but they're dynamic and faily distinct. The game also slowed down quite a bit in multiplayer as players moved apart and the game had to zoom out. This was on my laptop however, which is nothing close to a powerhouse, but still suggests some optimization issues.\n\nI don't think I'd recommend the game without a controller, I just can't imagine fluidly controlling the ships without one. Fortunately, it's been friendly with all types that I've tried (360 and logitech).\n\nIf nothing else, it's great arcade time waster.","January 4","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You face off in the ultimate arena known only as "arcade."  This game is different from most games on the market because your decisions actually mean something, just like the original Super Hexagon (no TellTale here!).  For instance, the "score" in the bottom left corner isn't a score at all; it shows how many humans the combine will keep alive to enslave when they take over Pandora (the higher number the better btw).\nThe story is very complex.  There's tons of sexual tension between the rocks and a triangle, and you, the player, can decide where to put it.  Will you release the tension by having alien sex like in Star Effect, or will you build it up to become stronger like in 1984 by George Orwell.  Like I said, your decisions really affect the story, and the better decisions you make the more story you get.  But of course, the best decision you can make is to get this game.\n9.8/10 "good game"","December 23, 2015","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
