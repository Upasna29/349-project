Done simple, but very well. The less hints you use the more points you get. Also if you find skip tokens you can use them to skip the puzzles if you get stuck. The characters are funny and so are their voices. You get to pick a character out of several, and you must travel place to place in a village. It is just a really good hidden object game. I always have trouble finding the last few oblects, because they are hidden so well. I love that. It is just simple but really well done. I will finish this game, and really enjoy it.","June 10, 2015","true","7.9"," 28 of 30 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","28","30","2","2"

If you played Al Emmo the Lost Dutch Mine, you will be familiar with things here. if not, that's okay. The game works as a stand alone experience too. You start out by selecting one of five playable characters. I thought this was a nice touch, as each character has different things to say and their own audio speech for every postcard collected. Game play involves finding a list of random objects in each scene before the timer expires. Along the way you can find different types of tokens to assist your game. Points tokens, time increase tokens, and skip puzzle tokens. There are 29 levels to solve and 29 postcards to collect from completing scenes at various locations.\n\nPROS:\n*Nice colorful scenes\n*A large variety of hidden objects\n*5 playable characters, individually voiced. Good replay value\n*With 29 levels, it's quite a large game\n*There's a relaxed game mode without a timer\n\nCONS:\n\n*At times certain objects were hard to see\n*On a few rare occassions there were some doubled objects in a scene (like 2 coffee cups) but only one of them would register as the correct object.\n*Resolution could be higher, but I suppose this is a limit of the AGS engine.\n*Some non-HOG puzzles may grow a little tedious (Find the Differences puzzles)","July 18, 2015","true","7.7"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

The hidden object scenes are plagued with stylistic incoherence, low-rez objects that barely look like what they're supposed to be, and repetition.\n\nHowever... there are a lot of hidden-object scenes, enough content to keep you busy for a good few hours. Again, if you don't absolutely love such games, you will likely hate this one.\n\nI played as Koko, and can't get enough of him! He's hilarious!","August 27, 2015","true","4.7"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

I clicked on a toe mound of a footprint. It didn't work, so I clicked again. I got punished by removing a small amount of time. I tried to click another area...heel. It worked. Ha. In a list, it wanted me to find grapes, there were three or four clusters look similar to grapes. I clicked on a green one, it failed, so I clicked on red or something, it failed, I clicked on a purple or something one, it worked. Maybe they didn't know that grapes come in different colors. I was also supposed to find a moth. It was tiny and sand colored on slightly darker sand soil. The game is somewhat low resolution.","June 20, 2015","false","5.6"," 13 of 24 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","13","24","0","2"

It was in bundle, so I paid about 0,30€ - not so bad. But the game is bad and ugly. I played whole campaign with one of five characters, but as I saw, it doesn't matter who will you choose, because campaigns are all the same. The postcards are different, but gameplay won't change. Clicking is badly made, even though I clicked right in the center of an object, game wouldn't agree with me and poof! Try again. Some items are hidden in ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ places.","July 19, 2015","false","6.6"," 0 of 9 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","9","0","0"

You can apparently find skip tokens in the game but if you're like me and hate a certain type of puzzle (slide puzzles) and it's the second puzzle in the game which means you won't have any skip tokens....this game might make you rage quit and just never play it again. =p","June 13, 2015","false","0.3"," 3 of 17 people (18%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","18","3","17","0","2"
