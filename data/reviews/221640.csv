It has a flawless, timeless perfection, right up there with Tetris. This is not a puzzle game, though. It's a tight, twitchy game about perception and nerves, with a bumping soundtrack worth the price of admission by itself.\n\nYou are a triangle in the center of the screen, rotating around a hexagon. The only keys required to play the game are left arrow and right arrow. You move at one speed: fast. So the moment and amount of time you press provide all the challenge.\n\nThe screen is divided into light and dark sections that radiate from the points of the hexagon. Walls stretch across a section or multiple sections. When you start a game of Super Hexagon, the walls start closing in toward you. If one hits you, game over.\n\nBut there's always a way out. You navigate a kind of maze by dodging the walls coming toward you in their multifarious configurations. With practice you can get the timing down and get around a few walls, no problem.\n\nThen the hexagon distorts, and starts throbbing in time to the music, and the screen starts spinning, and flashing, and changing colors, and other tricks that are similarly hard to notice because it's all happening so fast.\n\nPrepare to be punished.\n\nBegin!","July 15, 2013","true","25.4"," 631 of 683 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","631","683","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xKanaris/recommended/221640/","xKanaris","Kanaris","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xKanaris/","104 products in account","TL;DR- Super Hexagon is amazing and well worth the $3. Heck I would even buy it for $10. Just be prepared to cry a little, and don't buy it if you get nauseous looking at flashy things or are prone to seizures.\n\nThis game.. Wow. Where should I start? At this point I've only had about 5\nhours of playing it, but they have been some of the most frenzied and enjoyable\nhours of my life. I've got to say I've never seen a game like this, and I probably\nwon't again for a long time.\n\nIn Super Hexagon, you control a triangle which orbits around a hexagon, centered\non the screen. Around you, there are light and dark sections, made up of the space\nbetween vectors. Within those sections are walls of an outstanding color that\ncome racing toward the Hexagon. You're essentially within a maze of color. If you\nget hit by a wall, it's game over and your score is submitted automatically so that\nfriends can compete. It may seem like you're trapped, but there is always a way\nout, no matter how small the gap or how crazy the maneuver you're required to\npull. Meanwhile, you have a bunch of crazy lights and effects bouncing around\ndistracting you from the real goal, yet still managing to make the game so much\nbetter. On top of this, the music is classic, and superb.\n\nSuper Hexagon will provide you with 6 different levels, ranging from Hexagon ->\nHyper Hexagonest, and from Hard -> Hardestestest. You initially start with the\nfirst three- Hard, Harder, Hardest- but once you last for 60 seconds or longer on\nany of them, the levels go into hyper mode, and you also unlock their hyper mode\nforms in level select, where you can begin from the 60 second mark at 0 seconds.\n\nThe way the levels work is that each level has a set of 5-10 'gauntlets' or patterns\nthat it cycles through randomly. So for example, Hexagon will start as a few stray\nblocks, then it might run its 3x 180 Degree pattern, then its Double Zig-Zag\npattern, and then the hexagon in the center will... You'll see ;) . Each level has\ndifferent patterns, though some are shared throughout the game. Hyper modes\ncontain advanced versions of the patterns used in previous 'normal' levels.\n\nPossibly one of the best things about this game is that it only requires two buttons\nto play. These are Left and Right Arrow, or Buttons 1 and 2 on your mouse. You\ncan also connect a joypad if that's the way you roll. The fact that there is only one\nspeed for the triangle (fast) makes things difficult. After a while you will adjust\nthough, and learn to love the way the game works.\n\nAnother great feature of Super Hexagon is the fact that once you 'die' from hitting\na wall, you can start over within one second, so even if you do somehow manage\nto rage within this beautiful setting, it probably won't last long, because you'll be\noff with another try. Other than this, there is an annoying voice when you lose\nthat tells you it's 'gameover' and also one that says 'again' when you retry, but\nthese can be disabled by accessing the game's files and moving the sound files.\nOn top of these things, this game can be booted up and you can be playing any\nlevel within 3 seconds. It loads SO FAST.\n\nNow, do you think this game is worth it? Would you spend\n$3 (less than the price of a Big Mac) on this game? I think that you shoul go out and spend your three damn dollars on this amazing game!\n\n90/100.\nENJOY ^_^","January 3, 2014","true","29.5"," 112 of 118 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","112","118","0","5"

Is this some type of new drug? Very likely... Is it some type of common drug with a twist? Still very likely... Is Super Hexagon a new type of parasite bent on taking over humanity? OF COURSE IT IS.

Still, no matter how much this game hits you the face with failure states you still keep playing "just once more" because you believe you can do better.

I remember the time before, when the hills were green and the sky's blue seemed to stretch forever.\n\nBut it's gone now.\n\nI remember hearing about it from one of my friends. I saw him, twitching slightly, staring at the screen in a cold sweat, two fingers moving at a freightning pace. Later, I asked him what it was he was playing. He told me. Told me about the triangle. The hexagons. The pulsating lights. The music, upbeat and never ceasing. I laughed, and said I would pick up my own copy. Said it sounded fun. He warned me against it, the look in his eyes something I had never seen before: desparation, no, begging. I ignored him. I was young and stupid back then.\nI still remebered the day I first pressed "Play." A woman's voice called out the game's name. Softly, as in a morning sunrise. Smiling, I placed my hand upon the mouse, waiting to see what the game had in store.\n\nThat was a few months ago.\n\nIt's been a week since the nightmares stopped. But I never stop seeing it. I never stop living it. I'll look into a woman's eyes, but not see their color. I see only the triangle, slowly circling her pupils, taunting me. Sometimes I awake in the night, and I hear the music. Never ending. Never growing softer. Once, I was with my friends, having drinks at th bar. I looked down at my hands. Pulsing red. My arms purple. My friends were unaware that they were all kinds of colours, blue, then green, then an off-white. Then the triangle began orbiting my head. Slowly, I watched it pass. It almost seemed that it was looking back. I heard the music, slowly and softly, but then loud and sped up. Eveything was changing colors. I cried out, but all I heard was "line." I cried out again, hoping someone would hear me. "Hexagon. Hexagon. Hexagon. New Record."\n\nI... I...\n\n\n\nI'm sorry. I'm sorry for everything.\n\nFinal score: 11/10\nNo choice but to play again.","June 14, 2014","true","1.2"," 89 of 98 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","89","98","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LadyZana/recommended/221640/","LadyZana","Lady Zana","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LadyZana/","451 products in account","WARNING: this game may let you experience every possible emotion.\n\nSuper Hexagon Review\n- Genre(s): difficult, indie, soundtrack\n- Platform(s): 	Windows, OS X, Linux, iOS, Android, BlackBerry\n- Developer(s): Terry Cavanagh\n- Publisher(s): Terry Cavanagh\n- Release date(s): 2012 (iOS, Windows, OS X) until 2013 (Android, BlackBerry 10, GNU/Linux)\n\n"Game over. Begin. Game over. Begin. Game over. Begin ..." is something that you will hear very often once you decide to give this challenging, fast paced game a spin (no pun intented). A game that can be beaten in just 6 minutes, but that'll most likeley take atleast a couple of hours instead. If you think you won't feel the urge to throw your computer out of the window after spinning around mathematical shapes for hours and hours - whilst listening to amazing music - read on. Or better said: begin!\n\nA closer look\n\nYou take on the role of a little triangle and have to avoid getting hit by mathematical shapes that close in on you at high (and increasing) speed. You do this by moving your triangle to the right or left - very simple indeed - which is quite difficult (at first). That is just about it as far as gameplay goes and may seem to get boring quickly, but that is luckily not the case. There is just something about moving around different patterns and objects at high speed while headbanging to the amazing music.\n\nControlling the triangle is easy: you either use the mouse, arrow keys or a controller. The controls are also very tight, so if you lose, you can only blame it on yourself. You should then either practice more or you could try to switch between kb/m & controller to see with which you truly shine.\n\nAs I mentioned above, completing the game could take as little as 6 minutes - 1 minute per stage. Naturally it'll take much longer, as your brain doesn't know how to react to this game (yet). That makes it highly replayable since learning these patterns is not something you can do right away. It's all about that muscle memory. Each stage has different patterns that occur somewhat randomly, however, after playing for a while you'll be able to react quickly and appropriately to (almost) any given situation.\n\nGraphically, this game is nothing special, but it does have an interesting art style (like most indie games). There are a lot of different colors to be found in each stage that change and vary. The shapes are also straightforward (as they should be) and don't tend to be vague. Something that may keep people away from playing though: The combination of bright/changing colors and the fast rotations may cause headaches.\n\nThe best feature of this game - for sure - is its amazing soundtrack composed by Chipzel, who makes 8-bit music for different games. Were it not for these amazing tunes, I would've never had the courage to keep playing and eventually finish the game. Some say playing the game without sound may let you focus more. Honestly though, you really won't get the 'true' Super Hexagon feeling and experience without the music.\n\nI wouldn't describe this game as being a 'pure fun' one per se, but it sure gets your blood pumping. Besides the adrenaline rush, there is also a high sense of satisfaction when you finally beat that one stage. Or even more so when you beat the whole game: I felt ecstatic when I witnessed the end, which is a really weird, yet unique ending to a game. I never knew that a 'silly, little' game like this could make me feel so emotional after completing it, but it sure did. Even now, I like to come back to the game regularly to try and increase my highscore or just to enjoy the soundtrack some more.\n\nPros and cons\n\n+ Simple, yet fun concept\n+ Addictive & satisfying\n+ Amazing soundtrack\n+ Sweet pricetag\n\n+- May cause headaches (though that is personal)\n- /\n\nFinal verdict\n\nFor this low price, I definitely recommend it for everyone to try. You may be surprised at how good you are at this game. And even if you aren't: practice is key! People who love difficult games on the other hand, will probably enter heaven. With that being said: begi- GAME OVER.","February 15","true","40.2"," 72 of 77 people (94%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","94","72","77","13","5"

Entering the dimension of Super Hexagon is a trip that your body and mind alike will never forget. From the minute you press play and select your first level, you are immersed in a world where nothing is wrong. All your worries escape you. For the few seconds you play on your first level, and even every time you enter a level afterwards, you are filled with joy and all fears become easily conquerable. It truly is a feeling of bliss, and I can't get enough of it. Be careful when you enter this utopia, however, because your mind has the possibility of getting emotionally attached. You might not want to leave this wonderland. You might want to drop out of school, or leave your job. You need to remember that reality is where you earn the money to pay for electricity, and you need electricity to play Super Hexagon. The two realities live in perfect harmony. When you play Super Hexagon, you can feel the small triangle as a part of you. You develop feelings for the triangle. It becomes your best friend. It becomes YOU.

Its simple graphics and controls hide an incredibly challenging and addictive game that only gets better the longer you play it.\n\nThe beat of the music drives the entire experience, sucking you into the epileptic colors and lights of the moving levels. Super Hexagon never goes easy on you or even pretends to want to give you a hand. Its meant for those that love a challenge, that get goosebumps over seeing they beat their hi-scores, and that will spend hours practicing a single level.\n\nIf that sounds like you Super Hexagon will not disappoint. Though it began as a mobile game, the move to PC with improved controls only enhances the experience, and I can't imagine playing it any other way. If you are looking for a game that put your reflexes to the test, you've found it.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","June 23, 2013","true","2.1"," 69 of 82 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","69","82","0","0"

The essence of game is simple to a disgrace: it is necessary to hold on as it is possible more long, operating a triangle and wagging between figures. In game there are six levels of the complexity three of which need to be unblocked the infernal torments. The task becomes complicated that the field on which is your triangle turns, spins, changes corners, figures are transformed, from octagons smoothly turn into squares, and speed doesn't think at all to decline. When you look how other people pass the last levels - the head starts being turned. Music in game is simply divine. Because of it I didn't throw game right at the beginning.\nGame pulses and moves under music, synchronization between the events on the screen and a sound in earphones absolute, as gives special charm to game. To fly between "хексагонами" under such special electronics takes and inspires. Chipzel' huge respect for an excellent soundtrack.

I can feel it.  The experience is euphoric.\n\nThere are many, many hours yet ahead of me in Super Hexagon, and I have only attempted half of its content thus far.  Even so, I feel confident in saying that this is an all-time classic, one of the greatest games ever made.\n\nBuy Super Hexagon.  Play it for dozens of hours.  Play it with a gamepad's shoulder buttons; using your hands separately will improve cognitive separation between moving left and right over, say, clicking a mouse, and the response is much better than keys on a keyboard.  Turn off v-sync.  Practice using your peripheral vision.  Don't confuse the music tempo for the game speed.  Learn precise button timing so that you can move to your desired position without always staring directly at the center of the screen.  Develop the ability to remain calm at the moment of greatest pressure.\n\nExperiment with your mind: distract yourself while you play, reminisce about something unrelated, talk to somebody, look through the screen, put yourself in an abstract place as you try to visualize a vast plane of shapes converging upon you, just zone out, or try the opposite and allow your eyes to dart about the screen in a hyper-aware state.\n\nFall in love.  You'll feel such admiration for the simplicity of this game design, the mechanical and visual beauty of the patterns, the perfect balance that somehow always keeps the accelerating and randomly generated landscape plausibly navigable, and the devious implementation of visual effects to sabotage your sense of absolute motion.  You'll develop an inexplicable punk zeal for geometry as Jenn Frank nonchalantly announces your longevity: "Triangle.  Square.  Pentagon."  You'll ♥♥♥♥♥♥ uncontrollably at the sound of "Hexagon" as the colors melt into a deep blue or shift to white and candy pink.  You'll know that this is where the true game begins.  You'll suddenly notice the enormous unrestrained grin on your face as you finally, finally beat your previous record... and go on for another fifteen seconds.  You're in the ♥♥♥♥ing groove.  You're zen now.\n\n"Game over."  You feel ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed amazing.  You need to take a break for a minute because your hands are shaking and your heart is pounding.  Just for a minute.

That's also part of the reason why Super Hexagon is so popular, because it is one of the few minimalist games that test your raw skill, and is not afraid to punish you for the smallest of mistakes.\n\nThe level design is fairly linear, besides the frequent break-off points that let you choose which semetrical path to follow; these are fairly important in the later levels, where positioning and pre-planning is important for your continued survival. In other words, Super Hexagon will only allow you one or maybe two methods in which to pass by any particular obstacle, and that's it. It's your job to keep up with the ever-changing deluge of shapes rushing to crush your tiny triangle.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics are fairly solid, and I haven't had a situation where I can blame my death on the game, but rather on my lack of speed and pre-planning. The only thing I can tell you is that you will die. At lot. That's part of the beauty of Super Hexagon, it's the challenge that forces people like myself to continue the onslaught of shapes, and anything less than victory is an insult; make no mistake, this game is winnable, but you'll have to dedicate large chunks of your time in order to gain the necessary reaction time to complete the levels.\n\nI would estimate that it would take upwards of 20-40 hours for an average player the beat the game, but that's just a guess. Regardless, after all the deaths and failures, final victory has never been sweeter, and you may proudly display your achievements on your Profile page to show to the world just how badass you really are.\n\nSo enjoy the game, and make sure to stick with it; if you're not playing this game and learning from it, then it's playing you.","October 8, 2014","true","45.8"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","17","21","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/processing/recommended/221640/","processing","Chris","http://steamcommunity.com/id/processing/","161 products in account","I never suspected how much fun I'd have as a small triangle, restricted to a circular orbit of movement around a pulsating hexagon. The goal is to avoid colliding with an endless pattern of incoming geometric shapes. The complexity and speed of the patterns increase with each level. While the patterns aren't random, the order in which they appear is. This keeps the game challenging and unpredictable, and adds a surprising amount of replay value.\n\nIn a video gaming era marked by graphical excess and flash that ages even faster than the computer hardware it runs on, the flat, minimalist, timeless graphics of Super Hexagon are a welcome change. The frantic music by chiptune artist Chipzel also deserves a mention. It is a great complement to the fast pace of the game, and enriches the experience significantly.\n\nPeople often complain that this game is too hard. But one ought to keep in mind that the levels are also extremely short. All it takes to beat one level is to survive for 60 seconds. Yes, few will make it past 15 seconds on their first few tries. There will be many "deaths". But those 15 seconds represent 25% of the level, and there are only 6 levels to go through. Completing all the levels will probably take between 20 to 40 hours, which is close to the average for video games.\n\nThe sense of accomplishment that accompanies completion is significantly above average, however, judging both by personal experience and by what I've read about other people's experiences. And the enjoyment, or pain, depending on your point of view, doesn't have to end there. I've continued to play the game past completion, because there is endless room for improvement, as reflected by the ever increasing high scores on the world wide leaderboards.","March 6, 2015","true","71.4"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","11","11","0","1"

Its ludicrously low price during Steam sales makes it a quick fifty cent game for avid users to send to friends (and foes) as a seemingly harmless gift. Most people who receive Super Hexagon even believe it's some sort of joke—after all, it's hard to take such a cheap game seriously at first. But on top of being ridiculously contagious, Super Hexagon tends to leave users in a stunned, almost feverish haze of incredulity. This minimalistic, no-frills action game uses hypnotic trance music and fast-paced action to present players with a heart-palpitating test of mindless reflexes and quick thinking that will keep you coming back to it over and over again.\n\nYou play Super Hexagon as one of the simplest characters known to gamers: a triangle. Your triangle acts as a little arrow that circles around the center figure of a hexagon. The goal of Super Hexagon is to stop this arrow from being hit by shapes that come into the center hexagon at a speed that ranges from hectically fast to cataclismically hypersonic. The gameplay is incredibly simplistic, but skill-intensive. The levels are short: it takes only sixty seconds to beat each one, though those sixty seconds must be done without any errors. Completing a level can take hours of retries, each one pitting the player against their best time so far.\n\nBesides its desperately addictive gameplay, one Super Hexagon's most attractive features is, surprisingly enough, the atmosphere of this psychedelically simple action game. Super Hexagon's arena is something like a dance floor: a rhythmically pulsing, spinning, and twisting battleground set to delectably fast-paced trance music from the artist known as Chipzel. Combined with the outlandishly colorful, outstandingly mesmerizing patterns and shapes that make up Super Hexagon's swirling vortex of "GAME OVER. BEGIN.", this music forces an attractively frenzied pace on the player.\n\nWithout a doubt, Super Hexagon is worth the $3 price tag, even though most people purchase it when it's less than a dollar. This game will vex and annoy you to the point of fury, but Super Hexagon's irrationally cutthroat gameplay will always keep you coming back for more punishment. Super Hexagon gains an absurdly strong commendation from me—and the players who manage to complete Super Hexagon with all of the achievements unlocked earn an even more precious look of dazed stupidity and awe on my face.","September 27, 2014","true","0.5"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

But trust me, you won't.\n\nTo beat a level you have to avoid hitting walls. And that's it.\n\nHowever, it is not that easy. When I first started level 1 I died within 4 or 5 seconds. After more than 20 attempts I reached 10 seconds and thought "60 seconds? Nope, not possible.". Anyhow, you are never frustrated as the game is always a 100% fair and you will always come back.\nEvery situation can be beaten, each obstacle can be passed. The game hides nothing from you and is never unfair. If you die it is you and only you to blame. And with each attempt you get better. In the meantime I am able to relax in Level 1.\n\nThe soundtrack fits perfectly and somehow never gets old.\nThe graphics are as simple as possible so you are not distracted (and that is good as the levels are rotating, pulsing and changing their colours all the time).\nThere is no story and no cutscenes (besides a ... let's call it "music-video" after beating level 6 that does not interrupt the game flow).\nEven the achievements are simple: 1 for each level that is beaten (nothing useless as "die a hundred times" which would not add anything meaningful to the game).\nThere are no powerups and no enemies other than walls.\n\nAnd after beating level 6, the final level, I felt rewarded like never before in my video game carreer.\n\nOf course the game is not over yet as there are more records to be set (no level has an end, they are only beaten after 60 seconds but go on infinitely).\n\nAlso: After the first 60 seconds in the last level a "black and white" mode is launched. The music slows down and is relaxing, the rotations only happen rarely and everything seems to be peaceful ... until you die after 3 seconds.\n\nAnd then you will hear something you will be used to by then: "Game Over ... begin!"","February 8, 2014","true","28.1"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","3"

It's obvious that this was intended and, for the easier levels(hard and harder), is what makes the game difficult. It's a very simple concept, don't hit the walls. It's much harder than it looks though, and requires some good reaction times. As a note: turn off v-sync, doing so reduces input lag which is quite helpful. Me and a friend are currently playing againsed eachother to figure out who can get the best times.

You take control of a triangle positioned in the middle of the screen and have to dodge the walls coming your way. The game has a total of six levels (three normal levels and three "hyper modes"), each of which presents you with new patterns and challenges. If you survive for sixty seconds, you essentially "complete" a stage and unlock its hyper mode, although it goes on until you die, which allows skilled players to achieve high scores and compete against each other. Due to the overall difficulty of the game, patience and practice are very important factors. If you want to challenge yourself with a fun and hard game, then Super Hexagon is for you!","November 28, 2015","true","5.2"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","0"

Those are Sonic Colours, Sonic Generations and this Game. To date this is the fastest Sonic game to live. It has a unique gameplay style which is like Sonic Lost Worlds but good, or at least the tunnel sections in lost world. The game starts off slow like lynbrith, then goes to lost world, then to Sonic 06, then to Sonic Adventure, then to Sonic CD and the last level is so fast its faster then anything else. Also this is the first Sonic game music in a while that was does not have music by Crush 40. This is not a bad thing nor a good thing and if you really miss Crush 40 then you can put Crush 40 music into the game. The only negative is the fact that you can't play as any character but Sonic (unless you can find mods).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jadarma/recommended/221640/","Jadarma","Jadarma","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jadarma/","267 products in account","OverviewSuper Hexagon is in my opinion the perfect example of when simplicity does not impact on gameplay. The concept is simple, ridiculous, challenging and to a certain point, addictive. A great, minimalistic rythm game where you control a triangle in its struggle to survive from the evercollapsing environment while nodding your head to some cool electro music.\n\nThe Pros: Simple yet Fun - The game's objective is simple. The music keeps it entertaining. The beautiful changing colors make it fun to watch. Even the frustrating deaths make it enjoyable. This is one of those games where you will die. A lot, a lot of times, however you will still try to move on.\n\nGreat Music - The game uses groovy, fast paced music that surprisingly won't seem repetitive after listening to it countless times (due to how much you will have to restart the game). I don't even like electro music, but this is amazing. My compliments to the author(s)\n\nInteresting... Art? - The game has a nice rainbow filter and a geometric generating pattern. It blends perfectly with the music. I cannot compliment the graphics that... are not even there, but the minimalist, colorful aproach is something I personally like.\nThe Cons: Short - The game has 6 levels, or should I say 3, with two difficulty steps each. Although they take a long time to bead, I would have liked to see some more customisability, like a end game feature where you can alter the parameters.\n\nDifficult - I'm not going to sugarcoat it, this game was pretty hard. Look at my playtime. That's how long it took me to beat the last level. While I don't necessarily find it a con, unpatient people will, so heads up before saying: "Oh, just 6 achievements? I'll do it in an hour!"\nConclusion A great rythm game for cheap, both fun to kill time and test your reaction time. Definitely buy it if you see it on sale!\n\nIf you enjoyed this review and want to see more of my work, consider joining my group and follow my curator page!

You're gonna need it.\n\nThe gameplay is so immersive I once thought I was a real hexagon for several hours after I finished playing. Eventually starvation kicked in though, and as with all my dreams, I realized that it would never happen and I returned to being a human.\n\nThe soundtrack is flawless, it has been described by several experts and a mix between the classiest of jazz and the funkiest of funk. Only way cooler because nobody likes that sort of music.\n\nIt has a 5 star safety rating with inbuilt airbags and has been tested in all weather conditions.\n\nIt even has super in its name.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thistauruslovesgames/recommended/221640/","thistauruslovesgames","Hermix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thistauruslovesgames/","193 products in account","Super Hexagon. A simplistic addiction. A small and short action-retro game.\n\nThe objective is to survive a minimum of 60 seconds (one minute) in a hexagonal world of collapsing walls. The player (you) are a tiny triangle that's free-roaming rather than stiff and static in motion, which adds a bit of a challenge to the game. In this game, upon first start, are three basic modes, nicknamed Hexagon (the easiest, apparently), Hexagoner (medium difficulty), and Hexagonest (the first hardest). Your time on these stages is your overall score, and after lasting one minute in the first three, you unlock a much more harder mode of the same stage (Hexagon/er/est Hyper). And if you wish to "practice" for one of these difficulties, there's an Acrade mode under Options.\n\nMy opinions of it all:\nThe Good\nRestating what I said earlier: Super Hexagon is a simplistic addiction. If you enjoy hypnotizing yourself as you try to move a triangle through an infinitely rotating hexagonal labyrinth, this is a worthy game to play. With the leaderboard, the purpose of the game can be to beat friends by lasting longer than they did in these six stages. The fact that you can last beyond 60 seconds (120 seconds, in fact) is proof enough that you possess what it takes to beat such a mermorizing challenge. And that soundtrack; play the game for that retro-arcade soundtrack.\n\nThe Bad\nOnly six achievements? Though it might not do much, but the game could be give me more worthwhile challenges to reach, like an achievement for lasting 120 seconds in the third stage Hexagonest or 300 seconds in the first stage Hexagon. Is it wrong to ask for something humorous to be implemented into this game as well, like maybe a dot that serves as a power-up or temporary upgrade? Eh, the prize was fairly low, so that could be considered "too much." And for me, for a game this small, it has managed to upset me at how I was unable to accomplish something as simple as move out the way of the walls for so many seconds.\n\nOverall\nI would darely appreciate if the creator of Super Hexagon create a hilarious yet addictingly amazing sequel that plays with the human mind. The low prize for something like this? Fair enough. It helps pass the time (since I'm not using it wisely like others). It really does feel like a standard arcade game as well, graphics-wise and soundtrack-wise. However, it's up to the individual(s) to determine whether it's worth spending the subtle amount. Screenshot scores... Uh, colors were alright. That's all I can say about this abnormal form of hypnosis.\n\n--Sir Shinigami.","February 1, 2014","true","16.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thistauruslovesgames/recommended/221640/","thistauruslovesgames","Hermix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thistauruslovesgames/","193 products in account","Super Hexagon. A simplistic addiction. A small and short action-retro game.\n\nThe objective is to survive a minimum of 60 seconds (one minute) in a hexagonal world of collapsing walls. The player (you) are a tiny triangle that's free-roaming rather than stiff and static in motion, which adds a bit of a challenge to the game. In this game, upon first start, are three basic modes, nicknamed Hexagon (the easiest, apparently), Hexagoner (medium difficulty), and Hexagonest (the first hardest). Your time on these stages is your overall score, and after lasting one minute in the first three, you unlock a much more harder mode of the same stage (Hexagon/er/est Hyper). And if you wish to "practice" for one of these difficulties, there's an Acrade mode under Options.\n\nMy opinions of it all:\nThe Good\nRestating what I said earlier: Super Hexagon is a simplistic addiction. If you enjoy hypnotizing yourself as you try to move a triangle through an infinitely rotating hexagonal labyrinth, this is a worthy game to play. With the leaderboard, the purpose of the game can be to beat friends by lasting longer than they did in these six stages. The fact that you can last beyond 60 seconds (120 seconds, in fact) is proof enough that you possess what it takes to beat such a mermorizing challenge. And that soundtrack; play the game for that retro-arcade soundtrack.\n\nThe Bad\nOnly six achievements? Though it might not do much, but the game could be give me more worthwhile challenges to reach, like an achievement for lasting 120 seconds in the third stage Hexagonest or 300 seconds in the first stage Hexagon. Is it wrong to ask for something humorous to be implemented into this game as well, like maybe a dot that serves as a power-up or temporary upgrade? Eh, the prize was fairly low, so that could be considered "too much." And for me, for a game this small, it has managed to upset me at how I was unable to accomplish something as simple as move out the way of the walls for so many seconds.\n\nOverall\nI would darely appreciate if the creator of Super Hexagon create a hilarious yet addictingly amazing sequel that plays with the human mind. The low prize for something like this? Fair enough. It helps pass the time (since I'm not using it wisely like others). It really does feel like a standard arcade game as well, graphics-wise and soundtrack-wise. However, it's up to the individual(s) to determine whether it's worth spending the subtle amount. Screenshot scores... Uh, colors were alright. That's all I can say about this abnormal form of hypnosis.\n\n--Sir Shinigami.","February 1, 2014","true","16.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Despite Super Hexagon's simplicity, it quickly becomes addictive and becomes a game worth playing. If you can give the game enough time and dedication there's an amazing sensation of beating a level and unlocking a new one. The difficulty of the game quickly poses a threat and will eventually stop you in your path. Once you reach the point where you're simply not skillful enough to complete the level, the game is over for you.\n\nOverall, Super Hexagon is an addictive game that will take away a few hours of your time but definitely isn't anything you'll want to be playing on the long term.","June 23, 2014","true","25.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","1"

Super Hexagon is what I'd say what happens when videogames go to a rave. It's a very simple game. Make sure your little triangle doesn't touch the flashy lines and shapes coming in at you at a relentless pace. Very simple, very addictive, and put it this way, the end of a level is you lasting >25 seconds, so it's perfect for when you only have a couple of minutes to kill. The music and the pulsing and swirling of the game is hypnotic, I would definitely not recommend it to those who get dizzy or nauseous easily, and never to an epileptic.

Well, folks, welcome to Hell.\n\nBe prepared to restart the game after a few secs, 10-20 times in a minute. Rinse and repeat, again, again, again, until you're done - or good enough.\n\nThis game consists of "only" 6 stages, I rather call them "circles of Hell". That ♥♥♥♥ It's hard. Very hard (already told it's HARD with capital letters?).\n\nTheorically, this game could be completed in less than 10 minutes, if you are an autist, or have a great mind for detecting patterns, since each stage lasts 60 seconds (could be more, but 60 secs are the minimum needed to clear the stage, get the achievement and proceed to the next torture).\n\nI've completed this game in 9-10 hours. You get used if you play hours and hours in one sitting. Your mind learns how to read and, most importantly, antecipate the patterns. It's all about patterns, folks. My results were way better when I turned the music off and started to listen Two Steps from Hell (name quite apropriate, but not intentional), by the way. The game's music might be a more adequate challenge for being quite disturbing (that's the idea, I guess), but it gaves me headaches.\n\nThat all said, this game is awesome for those looking for a mental challenge more than a game. Super Hexagon is hardly a game in the way the most are used to. It's more a competition between your brain, eyes and hands.\n\nMy final advice is to avoid to buy it in full price, Wait for a sale or bundle, since this game could - and will be - frustrating and gives you no reason to replay it when you finally finishes (its like breaking the chains).","June 23, 2014","true","9.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

However, I started to regret saying that when I got the game and started to play it. I then thought it was immposible to beat after I beat the first level, but then I remebered something that the game designer said; "If you can beat the first level, there's nothing stopping you to beat the game." And now, I'm alot better at this game because of my fast reflexes (and fingers) and good hand-eye cordination. I'm still on my way to beat the final level, though, but here's a heads up: play a harder level before a easier level because it makes the easier level even more easy by spinning slower then usual (this is caused by a illusion). I would defenetly recommend this game, give it a 10/10, and a 5 star rating.","March 19, 2014","true","38.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","2"

The objective of the game is simple enough navigate your triangle through the obstacle for sixty seconds on every stage to win. Well its a bit more complex than that there are hyper modes you need to beat in order to win and the stages get faster and faster as you progress. The game also has one of the greatest sound tracks i have ever heard with 3 different songs all made for each level with there very own hyper twist.

All of which affect your wonderous adventure as much as possible.\n\nEach character you meet has a distinct personality that you never get to completely get to know. Some smart, some dumb, some quadralaterals, some triangles. The main villian, General Deathshape, as soon and you see the kind of terror he can unleash you want nothing else but to end his life, and let nothing stand in your way.\n\nMy favorite part has to be the advanced inventory setup and HUGE amounts of items to find and use. the first game i can relate this to is borderlands, with its expansive weapon, shield, and other gear variants. the list just goes on and on\n\nNo 2 areas you step into are alike, the developers over at Disney Pixar took countless minutes developing different landscapes, enemies, and vehicles.\n\nThe graphics of this wonderful myth have to be its strongest point. the lines are so smooth and straight, not a circle in sight.\nthis really help immerse you into the experience trying to be displayed, you feel like your part of the game, and every step taken is one of your steps, every shot fired is one of your shots, avery butt secksed is one of your butts.\n\nThis game is so amazing i simply dont know where to begin. or end\n\n2/10 best game ive ever played","June 19, 2014","true","16.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","1"

The only way to describe it is that you are a damn triangle spinning around a damn hexagon avoiding shapes that go to you.

Ther's  the point when you don't even know how many hours you have spent since you started it, your eyes hurt and you quit the game and still hearing the music (very good music, btw). When you pass the "hexagon" stage you feel like a pro, "hexagoner" puts your feet back on the ground. It's easy though.

However, I started to regret saying that when I got the game and started to play it. I then thought it was immposible to beat after I beat the first level, but then I remebered something that the game designer said; "If you can beat the first level, there's nothing stopping you to beat the game." And now, I'm alot better at this game because of my fast reflexes (and fingers) and good hand-eye cordination. I'm still on my way to beat the final level, though, but here's a heads up: play a harder level before a easier level because it makes the easier level even more easy by spinning slower then usual (this is caused by a illusion).

It blends a splendid time of fun and joy (this before you actually open it) with the wrath of Zeus, the anger of Kratos and the sour taste of your tears, while you ask "how?" and "why?" and come back for more with the sweet ilusion of progress and steam achievements.\n\nHere are some characteristics:  Replay value:\nHonestly, I haven't done anything besides replaying the first level. Offline time was spent on the task. Success was not  yet achieved. It teaches you the true meaning of the word "hard":\nI thought i knew it... I played league and ♥♥♥♥... I can't even... It shares simmilarities with sexual intercourse:\nSometimes you can´t find the spot.\nSome(most)times you don't last long.\nUnadvised for the ladies to practise it while on the period. Rage Simulator:\nI used to play league. The time i spent with that community made me calmer. I became able not to shout my lungs at the screen because of the one 0-10 mid laner at my ranked promos. Well, league ain't got nothing on this.\nYou will now scream at walls, lamps, your laptop, that girl (which for some reason you've just remembered of) that called you a b1tch in 3rd grade, and so on... It endangers your health:\nStress, nightmares, insomnia, suicidal tendencies, heroin-like addiction\nHallucinations about passing the wretched 1st level (oh god why?)...\nSudden war-like flashbacks\nDehidration due to excessive crying Introduction to philosophical thougth\n"What am I doing with my life?"\n"Was it the chicken?

The only way to describe it is that you are a damn triangle spinning around a damn hexagon avoiding shapes that go to you.

Ther's  the point when you don't even know how many hours you have spent since you started it, your eyes hurt and you quit the game and still hearing the music (very good music, btw). When you pass the "hexagon" stage you feel like a pro, "hexagoner" puts your feet back on the ground. It's easy though.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sarcastic_fantastic/recommended/221640/","sarcastic_fantastic","Sarcastic_Fantastic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sarcastic_fantastic/","91 products in account","Super Hexagon is a simple, yet fun and addicting arcade, bullet-hell style game that will both infuriate you and greatly elate you. An indie game by Terry Cavanagh that probably didn't take long to make but should keep you coming back for many hours.\n\nWhat is Super Hexagon?\nThe game has one simple goal, to move your triangle around the center hexagon to avoid the oncoming trapezoids for as long as possible. This is the only objective in the game, there are other features such as an arcade mode (for tournaments and events) and hyper mode which is a harder variant of the first levels, but that is the core activity.\n\nThe game comes with 6 levels (7 if you count the ending sequence), Hexagon, Hexagoner and Hexagonest plus 3 Hyper versions of these 3 too. It has a progressive unlocking system meaning you have to complete Hexagon to unlock Hexagoner and Hyper Hexagon, so if you can't complete the first level you're stuck (if you can't do the first one however it's unlikely you'd be able to complete the others as they are harder).\n\nTo complete a level you have to navigate your triangle through the gaps and paths in the onslaught of shapes. Reaching 60 seconds will "complete" the level and unlock the next and the relevant hyper stage, however you can continue on to try and beat the records of longest survival.\n\nControls & Options\n\nThe options menu is lacking, it doesn't have any graphical or audio settings except windowed or fullscreen mode, enable or disable sound and enable or disable VSync (which I would recommend disabling as it causes issues for many making it that much harder to play). You can also enable Arcade mode from here and delete your records. The lack of resolution selection means you may have letterboxing or black bars on the side of your screen.\n\nSurprisingly for a small indie game like this the game does support Xbox360 controllers (and steam controller but that goes without saying). The gamepad controls can be configured here, however there is no joystick support as far as I can tell which would be my primary reason for using a controller. On the keyboard side of the things, the keys (left and right arrow keys to move, space to select stuff, esc for going back, tab to see leaderboard) aren't re-bindable.\n\nAesthetic & Music\n\nThe aesthetic is minimalistic while also being vibrant with colour. The scheme varies from level to level, but is always pulsating and moving around - add this to changes in colour while playing makes the whole thing very psychedelic indeed. After playing for more than a few minutes your eyes will start focusing on different things and you become completed entranced in the game, like being hypnotised. This might be a bad thing, and you might experience visual sickness but for me it just becomes that much more "intense" of an experience. You feel on the edge of your seat, thinking so hard to just get those last 2 seconds.\n\nThe soundtrack is absolutely wonderful, but I'm biased as I already like chiptune. Chipzel the composer has made 3 tracks (plus a special for the ending), one for each set of levels, that last roughly a minute and will loop if you survive longer. A genius decision by Terry Cavanagh (the designer) was to start levels at different points in the music tracks, so if you aren't very good you don't just hear the first 5 seconds of music every time you start, and instead hear most of it eventually. The soundtrack, which is also available from Chipzel's Website[chipzel.co.uk] is exciting and fast-paced. The shapes will also pulsate in time with the rhythm for extra effect.\n\nEnjoyment & Value\n\nI think people's primary concern with this game is that they'd either get bored too quickly or it'd be too difficult and they'd give up after not long. Firstly, I've played this game for 6 hours, purely in 10 minute bursts (and others in reviews here have played for much longer). If I can't decide what game to play, or I'm bored, hit up Super Hexagon and play for a couple minutes. Its great for these moments, because you want to keep coming back to the game. Unless you've played for ages there will normally be something you haven't completed yet. And even then you can shoot for the top records.\n\nIn terms of difficulty, yes it is difficult, and at first you will wonder how on Earth you'll complete the first level. I felt the same too, but now the first level is a slow breeze. You improve and you learn patterns and you get better. You might see a video of someone surviving the hardest level for an hour but that's because he/she has played the game for many many hours. The game also has the advantage of its purity in mechanics. It's simple but fair, and if you died you know for sure that was your fault. You say to yourself: "Darn that was close. I'll remember that bit for next time though, I can do better." Then you start again and maybe get a second longer than last time, and so on.\n\nFor its price, it's well worth the value. I have had so much fun with this game, and those special moments when you beat a level for a first time - it just feels amazing, you feel like a Zen master of all shapes and it really negates those hundreds of frustrating tries. I will admit this isn't for everyone though, some might get frustrated at the game and not bother, rather than persist. It requires a certain amount of effort, and to be fair, skill to really get the most enjoyment out of the game. Another improvement that could be made, would be more content and levels. More great music, more beautiful kaleidoscope images, possibly some easier levels to ease people in and some harder levels for the veterans, or maybe an endless mode where you can sit back, watch and listen.\n\nShould you buy Super Hexagon?\nI picked this game up when it was only sale for something like £0.50 GBP, and even if it's not, I would highly recommend purchasing this if you need a small game on the side. It's challenging and nerve-wracking in its mechanics but also tranquil and eloquent in its design. It isn't perfect, and maybe suited more as a mobile game (which it is). It doesn't have all the features that you'd want from an arcade indie game and is lacking a bit on the content side, but you could argue that adding in more levels and slightly useless modes and leaderboards would take away from its simplicity. But for those moments when you need to take a break from hardcore games, but still want something difficult, you can go into your own little bubble of colour and music and just focus on one simple task - to become a Hexagon.\n\nThis is my first review and if you have any questions or criticism then feel free to leave a comment.","May 20","true","7.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","3"

The six achievements are earned when you reach this goal for each level, so the pressure is on. Although it looks like there isn't much to do in the game, the friends/global scoreboards will push you to keep raising your personal high scores even after you get the achievements. Also, if you are an achievement hunter, this game is one of the easier ones to get all the achievements in, since there's only six of them.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/abilitypowered/recommended/221640/","abilitypowered","Short","http://steamcommunity.com/id/abilitypowered/","415 products in account","Super Hexagon is an arcade type game where you try to keep your triangle from hitting the walls of spinning hexagons while they come at you very quickly.  This is a review by a disabled gamer (I only play with a mouse).\n\nhttp://youtu.be/fAtaCmT_YnI\n\nAs soon as I opened the game I hit an immediate roadblock.  You begin full screen with your left and right mouse buttons only scrolling the menu.  To actually select anything on the menu, the game says to press space bar.   I later accidentally discovered you can press both mouse buttons simultaneously to act as a space bar. but the game itself never tells you this.  So the first 5 minutes of my experience was spent trying to find someone to come to my PC to press space so I could access options.  Once I had help and could access the options, I could change to windowed mode.  Windowed mode is borderless and worked well with onscreen keyboard.  You can play with your mouse or keyboard only.  There's also an option for joypad.\nGameplay itself can be completely mouse controlled.  Left click to spin board left, right click spin board right.  Clicking needs to be quick to help with precision.  While Fun and adictive, it can also be frustrating. I could only last a few seconds.  The game is difficult for everyone with game modes starting with hard and moving on to harder, hardest & several locked levels.  With that in mind, I also had someone without a disability play and noticed it was still difficult to get far but moves seemed to be more precise.\n\nThe game is playable with only a mouse or keyboard.  That is Assuming you can press both mouse buttons at once or have someone who can press space to get it out of full screen, it is mouse only playable.  That being said, if you can't make quick agile clicks, get easily frustrated, or have issues with flashing spinning graphics...  I would avoid this game.\n\nBesides issues you might have with accessibility, the game IS addictive fun, even when you're losing.","November 25, 2013","true","11.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It´s pretty simplistic, but completely genius in certain way.\n\nPoint of the game is to avoid obstacles, coming from six directions (or less, when map changes the pace), with little triangle moving 360 around the center.\nSimple, right? Not so fast! To complete the stage, you need to survive for 60 seconds, during which game changes speed, rotation, tilt, patterns, number of directions and colors. If you die, you start from the zero. And you will die, A LOT. I think that having easiest mode labeled as "hard" speaks for itself. Compared to this, every nightmare mode (insert game of your chioce here) feels like a child´s play. Prepare to have you memory and reactions challenged.\n\nImportant aspects to be talked are actual fun and enjoyment. While it is really challenging and satisfying, I miss something that would make me to come back. All you can really do is to practice and die until you get to some point, where you would even dream about hexagons. Idea is great, music is great, voices are great. But it just feels to me there are so many other games that you would like to spend time with, rather than Super Hexagon.\n\nI´m sorry, but recommending the game would be hypocritical at this point, I will have to go different way than the crowd.\n\nBut still, you might want to check it out, before trusting some random guy.\n\nAnd, also, big respect for those that managed to complete the game!\n\n*Played with controller (alternatively playable with keyboard or mouse - all are OK)\n\n***** 5/10\n***** 50%","July 25, 2014","false","1.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It's a neon-chiptune reflex puzzle game where you dodge the hexagon pieces. Super Hexagon does pattern recognition, and Super Hexagon does reflexes. Super Hexagon doesn't care about the other stuff. It slams its crushing difficulty on the table with a rumble, plain for all to see, then stands in front of the table with its arms folded. "Do it, or walk away," it seems to shrug.

With only 1 song called "Courtesy" which belongs to beloved 8-bit musician Chipzel. I played this game for only 6 minutes now, completing the first three chapters and trying on fourth, all I can say Terry and Chipzel did a great job with this and added so much on the original title, It definitely deserves 1 dollar which is it's sale price on Steam right now.

The price, in my opinion, is a bit expencive for the game but it's relatively cheap so when there's a sale for this game GET IT! The game is very simple but very hard. You are a small triangle that cango around in circles trying to avoide obstacles. Each level gets harder and faster and each level has it's own funky music. Each level you have to avoide obstacles for at least 60 seconds so then you unlock the new level. There are only a few levels but hey take a long time to complete. The first time you play a level your brain goes; 'WTF! WHAT THE HELL! AGHHHHHHHHH! ' but eventualy you learn routes to avoide them and eventualy you'll complete it if you keep on playing it (which it was hard for me not to stop playing it as it's very addictive). And the further levels you play the previous levels become very slow to you. They're the same speed but they feel soo slow and your like: How was this so fast before?\nBut if your the person who rages at games, then: don't buy it cos you'll thrash your pc. I've got a friend who gets angry easily and he played a simular game to this and he smashed his pc. So if you rage then don't buy it. If you don't rage at games: then do buy it\nThere isn't much more to this game as this is it.

You will imagine past people you have met, people you know and love cheer you on towards the end. You will learn to control your breath. You will learn music is your best friend, and your worst enemy. You will feel the adrenaline rushing through you. You learn to control it. You finaly find out how to get past every part. You have opened the key and unlocked this game. You then laugh at the game's face, as you tread to victory. No matter how many times it kills you, now you only smile, knowing you can do it this time. You have do doubt. As you get to the final level, attempting to keep the excitment from bursting out. You finaly reach 70 seconds. As you let it go. You let it all go, and watch your past appear right infront of you. You start laughing of such happiness you will never feel again. You did it. After going through so much...\n\n\n\nand then you shove it up your friends asses.\n\n\nTL:DR this game will put you through alot of ♥♥♥♥, but i think its worth it.\n\ngg super hexagon.... gg....","September 23, 2014","true","16.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/drschwartz/recommended/221640/","drschwartz","Hellfire Hydra","http://steamcommunity.com/id/drschwartz/","193 products in account","Probably the most addicting game I have played in my entire life. Its complexity of maneuvering around the hexagons combined with the trippiness of the maps, makes this one hell of an experience. The difficulty of the game is quite high, so play this game with a mindset that you ARE NOT in fact the master. However, when you crash and burn in the game, it never becomes a rageful experience. You immediately are pulled into the draw of playing just one more round. The rounds are short enough that you don't feel as though you wasted time when you die.\n\nThis game is almost a replacement for drugs. While Audiosurf is like smoking weed, Super Hexagon is like being on straight acid.  It fits under Level 3 of the Psychedelic Experience ranking:\n\nLevel 3\nVery obvious visuals, everything looks curved and warped, patterns and kaleidoscopes seen on walls and faces. Some mild hallucinations such as rivers flowing in wood grain or 'mother of pearl' surfaces. Closed-eye hallucinations become 3-dimensional. There is some confusing of the senses (synesthesia). Time distortions and 'moments of eternity'. Movement at times becomes extremely difficult (too much effort required). Can be achieved with common doses of LSD, psilocybin mushrooms, peyote, ayahuasca, and Super Hexagon.\n\nWelcome to Super Hexagon, the cheapest, but most addicting game you will find in your lifetime.\n10/10","December 24, 2013","true","14.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It messes with your mind in an effort to make you lose your concentration by flashing different colours, changing directions and even the angle of the game itself. The music keeps you playing and sometimes you'll only press restart to hear the fast-pased chiptunes that change depending on the difficulty. Probably the best value for money game on the market to date, I'd reccommend this to everyone with fingers and eyes, because that's all you need.","January 2, 2014","true","54.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The games attractive interface at the start and lovely female voice belies the eye pain that you will endure. If you have a gamer friend with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder and you want to torture them, gift them this game. The quest for those mystical levels will surely cause pain and suffering.\n\nAmazingly I made it to level 2 with a score of 13.x seconds. Until i achieved it, i believed it to be in the same league with Unicorns, in that unless your on some type of banned substance, it's not something you will ever see.\n\nThe music in the game is great, and I wish I could have heard more than the 13.x seconds of it.\n\nIf they make a revision or new version of this game, they need an easier mode, even if only to get you going, with a gradual build up. They need to give options for colors and flashing so that i don't break into convulsions trying to make it to level 3. Lastly, they need to not have the music start over when the level does so you get to hear the entire song rather than the first seconds of  it.\n\nI recommend it if it's on sale, but otherwise I would wait and hope for Super Super Duper Hexigon.","December 26, 2013","true","0.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

That's all there is to it and by now you have guessed that this is very minimalistic game. The goal of the game is to survive for as long as possible as walls and shapes approach from all around. This sounds simple and easy enough you start up the first level and are met by pulsating chiptune music and a few seconds later a resounding "Game Over". Super Hexagon is a difficult twitch based game and you will fail to survive the goal of 60 seconds many many times. Avail ye not however as the game is the modicum of fairness. With practice and memorization you'll learn all the patterns it throws at you and your times will increase. By surviving longer and longer you start to enter into a kind of zone were everything fades away except the game and you eventually get highscores in the high 200s! Since on avarage one round doesn't last more than a minute, this game is a great timekiller, and with enough practice can become a way to reach a cathartic state of focus and relaxation.

The hexagon has recently been overlooked by its sister shapes; the pentagon and the world famous octagon. With its new improvents to the two-dimensional graphical interface of the hexagon, this game has brought back my unbeknownest love for the incadesent, six sided shape, the hexagon. With its new and improved dynamic motions, dodging moving and converging edges of hexagons have never been more fun. The replayability of the three offered levels is unmatched by any game on the market today and for years to come. I have an unrelenting devotion to this game that I have began my own of project creating my very own version "Super Septagon". It will feature all new levels and playstyle. It will hit the Market in January of 2018 for only $39.99. Click HERE to donate to production.\n\nEDIT: Super Septagon is well on its way in production! We're only in need of around 2.5 million USD of funding for the finishing touches.\n\nEDIT: Super Septagon IN IMAX 3D hits theatres Fall of 2020!\n\nEDIT: Despite huge pledge support, the funding of Super Septagon has fallen behind its projections! We have raised an exact .0000003% of out the $2.5 Million goal!

It's 2-D and simple, and that's all the game needs\n\n+Each level is unique and brings its own level of difficulty\n\n+THE SOUNDTRACK DESERVES 11/10\n\n+The levels have randomly generated patterns, making it so you can't just memorize when to hit a button like some other "difficult" game out right now that people feel the need to make entire YouTube channels for *cough* Geometry Dash *cough*\n\n+It has to be memetic or something because I keep coming back to play this game over and over, even if for 10 minutes\n\nI'd rate this thing an Apeirogon out of Hexagon for a game that is difficult yet extremely fun to play, and it's one of the few "rage games" that I actually enjoy playing.\n\n=EDIT=\nI've beaten the game after 9 hours of lethal geometry.

The hexagon has recently been overlooked by its sister shapes; the pentagon and the world famous octagon. With its new improvents to the two-dimensional graphical interface of the hexagon, this game has brought back my unbeknownest love for the incadesent, six sided shape, the hexagon. With its new and improved dynamic motions, dodging moving and converging edges of hexagons have never been more fun. The replayability of the three offered levels is unmatched by any game on the market today and for years to come. I have an unrelenting devotion to this game that I have began my own of project creating my very own version "Super Septagon". It will feature all new levels and playstyle. It will hit the Market in January of 2018 for only $39.99. Click HERE to donate to production.\n\nEDIT: Super Septagon is well on its way in production! We're only in need of around 2.5 million USD of funding for the finishing touches.\n\nEDIT: Super Septagon IN IMAX 3D hits theatres Fall of 2020!\n\nEDIT: Despite huge pledge support, the funding of Super Septagon has fallen behind its projections! We have raised an exact .0000003% of out the $2.5 Million goal!

It is a simple concept, yet it is well executed, addictive and satisfying to improve at. While it is a difficult game, it is very fair; at no point did I die to something which I felt was 'cheap'. As a result of this, dying didn't particularly frustrate me; instead I kept going to see if I could improve. This was further aided by the fact that the death animation is pretty quick so you can hop back in to the game quickly. It is a very honest game in that sense - your performance is based on skill alone. This game also has a neat retro aesthetic and soundtrack.\n\nOverall, I would definitely recommend this game to fans of simplistic, retro-style games or to people who want a challenging but fair game. I wouldn't advise you get this game if you are new to gaming in general due to its difficulty, however.\n\nIf you are struggling to improve, my friend gave me some great advice that helped me get better at some of the earlier levels. If you play on a harder difficulty for a bit before going back to an easier one, the level will feel much slower and you should find dodging everything much easier.","March 14","true","2.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The hexagon has recently been overlooked by its sister shapes; the pentagon and the world famous octagon. With its new improvents to the two-dimensional graphical interface of the hexagon, this game has brought back my unbeknownest love for the incadesent, six sided shape, the hexagon. With its new and improved dynamic motions, dodging moving and converging edges of hexagons have never been more fun. The replayability of the three offered levels is unmatched by any game on the market today and for years to come. I have an unrelenting devotion to this game that I have began my own of project creating my very own version "Super Septagon". It will feature all new levels and playstyle. It will hit the Market in January of 2018 for only $39.99. Click HERE to donate to production.\n\nEDIT: Super Septagon is well on its way in production! We're only in need of around 2.5 million USD of funding for the finishing touches.\n\nEDIT: Super Septagon IN IMAX 3D hits theatres Fall of 2020!\n\nEDIT: Despite huge pledge support, the funding of Super Septagon has fallen behind its projections! We have raised an exact .0000003% of out the $2.5 Million goal!

It is a simple concept, yet it is well executed, addictive and satisfying to improve at. While it is a difficult game, it is very fair; at no point did I die to something which I felt was 'cheap'. As a result of this, dying didn't particularly frustrate me; instead I kept going to see if I could improve. This was further aided by the fact that the death animation is pretty quick so you can hop back in to the game quickly. It is a very honest game in that sense - your performance is based on skill alone. This game also has a neat retro aesthetic and soundtrack.\n\nOverall, I would definitely recommend this game to fans of simplistic, retro-style games or to people who want a challenging but fair game. I wouldn't advise you get this game if you are new to gaming in general due to its difficulty, however.\n\nIf you are struggling to improve, my friend gave me some great advice that helped me get better at some of the earlier levels. If you play on a harder difficulty for a bit before going back to an easier one, the level will feel much slower and you should find dodging everything much easier.","March 14","true","2.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Not only is it Fun and challenging it can also boost your memory and reflexes too. A great game when you are in a waiting queue or just plan to have some fun.\n\nI highly advise to give this game a chance, it's a low cost, and Im sure you'll love it as most others do too.
