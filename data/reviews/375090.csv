There are only 20 minutes of decent puzzle solving + 20 minutes of fairly nonsensical dialogue (set to repetitive music and a flipbook of 'quirky' art), before you're left with the credits and the unsettling feeling of 'Well... guess that's it...."\n\nTake your $5 and go rent some 'meh' movie like the third Matrix, as it will last longer, make more sense, and leave you feeling quite a bit more satisfied.\n\n===\n\n11/21/15 EDIT:  The base price of this game has been greatly reduced from $8 (the non-sale price when I purchased it) to $3.  While this may not help those of us who bought in early, the current price of this game is now more on par for the limited gameplay it offers.  At the new base price, you may want to consider picking it up during a sale to quickly run through the unique puzzles.","July 29, 2015","false","3.9"," 17 of 23 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","17","23","0","0"

It's take on puzzle solving is one of the most unique I've seen in a game.\n\nPros:\nGreat art style\nGood soundtrack\nInteresting story/premise\nChallenging puzzles/interesting take on problem solving\nNeat characters\n\nCons:\nThe voice acting is a little weak, but it's still pretty good\n\nAll in all this is a really great game and I'm enjoying the hell out of it.\n\n\nEDIT:\nI just finished the game. I gotta say, 10/10 man. Very well done. I only wish it was a little bit longer. An hour for a game like this isn't nearly long enough.\n\nYou should definitely get this game though.","June 4, 2015","true","1.2"," 19 of 28 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","19","28","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jatan11t/recommended/375090/","jatan11t","GAR","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jatan11t/","4334 products in account","The Eigengrau Menagerie is a fantastic little artsy puzzle game.  It's a little short, perhaps, for the money, but it's certainly one of the more unique experiences on Steam.  You play as a pilgrim, wandering to find the great Thoughforms of the world.  The gameplay is pretty simple: you start each challenge with time frozen, and you can take as much time as you need to read the descriptions of all of the highlighted objects and people around you.  Each challenge is a pretty simple puzzle, but must be solved within a couple of seconds, before the challenger kills or captures you.  Luckily, you do get infinite tries, but therein lies one of the problems - because of this mechanic, you can pretty much just brute force all of the puzzles if you choose to.\n\nI found the best part of the game to be the backgrounds art - you can clearly tell that it was drawn as a labor of love.  The background music complements the art style quite nicely, and the story, although quite esoteric at times, is acceptable.  Overall, I'd definitely recommend the game.\n\nPros:\nFantastic art style\nNice BGM\nGood atmosphere, and a good experience overall\nPotato Erotica\n\n\nCons:\nWriting is perhaps a bit pretentious\nLength - game is far too short\nNo save option - you have to finish in one sitting (although It only took me around 30 minutes to finish, so it shouldn't be a problem)\nBGM and voice acting are recorded at different volumes\n\nOther thoughts:\nThe writer really likes the color "bronze-gold" for some reason.  Does it mean something?","July 12, 2015","true","0.7"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","9","10","2","0"

All of which is hand drawn.\nThe music is very appropriate for each scene.\nThe gameplay is interesting and highly immersive.\nThe potato erotica.\n\nCons:\nThe game is rather short.\nNot enough potato erotica.\n\nAll in all I give this game a 10/10 and recommend this game.","June 11, 2015","true","0.3"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","67","8","12","7","0"

I haven't even gotten to the second thoughtform, and I've run into:\n- "spiraling obsidian staircases spiraling up the tower"\n- amateurish voice acting\n- the narration switching at random between two sets of pronouns when referring to Raw Gut\n- there's a character named Raw Gut. I am supposed to like Raw Gut, or at least not gag whenever I say aer/her name\n- gold-brass brass-gold gold-brass everything\n\nBasically the written parts need serious workshopping, or at least not to be hammered home by the community-theater stylings of the narrator.\n\nOn the other hand, I love the puzzles. The solutions are all things you arrive at logically based on the information provided. The challenge comes from the time limit and figuring out what info is relevant.\n\nUIltimately I like the puzzles more than I dislike the writing style, plus I only paid two bucks, so I recommend it.\n","January 1","true","0.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

If you're a fan of high action paced stuff this isn't the thing, but if you liked animes like 'Mushishi' it's perfect. As for the game, it took me a couple hours the first time I played and 3 minutes the second time. The programming isn't anything special but the art is beautiful. Sure it's not GTAV but it still feels good to knock a bodyguard off of the obsidian tower.\n\n7/10\n\nAs for the low time played. I bought the game pre-steam on a website called 'itch.io'","June 12, 2015","true","0.6"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

The aesthetic is fantastic and the world building though small does give details that satisfy my interest. The Game was an hour long from start to finish with me playing it.\n\nThe Challenges were simple but they required reading into to find their solution so the game has that credit. One fault I did find when playing the game was the transitions during the action sequences being a little too sudden, Having to replay it over and over a few times due to their jerkyness. The Puzzles themselves didn't provide a consequence for failure and just allow you to try them again, For those who want to blaze through and miss the details in the objects you interact with. Which brings me to another point.\n\nThe Arrow to click continue sometimes obscured some of the text making it hard to read. It's still readable but it can be troublesome especially for those who may have a hard time reading the text.\n\nA lack of options Menu really detracted from this game, As with my thoughts on the voice acting. I'd like to hear the songs proper themselves without voices in the way. Another feature I feel is missing that each scene could have a remove visor option as to view the entire scene without them obstructing the view As they do obstruct as much as the arrows over the text in some places.\n\nThe Price point for this game I feel at the time of writing ($8.00) Is a little steep for an short 1-2 hour experience but the experience is worth it for the brief time you play it feeling a bit like a good short story you'd be able to pick up in a book store.\n\nPros:\n-Beautiful traditional art style\n-Good music.\n-Not too complicated puzzles. Challenging enough.\n-Decent lore and world building\n-Good atmosphere at specific parts of the story (Won't reveal much as to prevent spoilers)\n-Trading cards give quite some insight to the characters and settin if read. (Gotta collect 'em all!)\n-The characterization of the cast.\n\n\nCons:\n-The game is very linear.\n-The voice acting was rather weak in some parts.\n-The price point.\n-The Credit Sequence (which honestly made me squirm a little due to the drastic change of style)\n-The Puzzles were a bit too easy. And rather Trial and error with no major consequence for failure.\n-Animation Transitions were jerky\n-A lack of Options Menu\n\nI feel it's a good introduction to the creator's career, But there is obviously room for improvement. I would reccomend this game for those who like a short story, If you can personally justify the price.\n","June 12, 2015","true","1.2"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Fails the dollar per hour of entertainment scale by quite a bit. There's something very endearing to how much effort has clearly been put into this though, like art made by a child: not good but fills you with a kind of hope for future development.","July 6, 2015","false","2.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Such a beautiful structure of words that really reeled me in during development.\n\nThe story introduction to this game is strong.\n\nI got a very strong feeling from the hand drawn work.\nIt reminded me of the Dark Souls universe in a very bright and hopeful manner. You can tell time and appreciation went into it.\nI enjoyed taking in all the backgrounds, characters, objects, maps and locations as they came.\n\nThe voice acting is competent, however this is a game where I want to listen, and then solve puzzles, so I did not enjoy the voice acting for a character abruptly ending to be replaced by reading.\nThe music is soothing, catchy and enjoyable. It fits comfortably with each scene and area. It does however loop a bit, but I was happy to just sit back and listen to the soundtrack a few times aswell.\n\nThe controls are very simple. I was slightly confused with the mechanics at first, but eased into it in no time.\nI also am color blind and still was able to play relatively simple. It took me a while to see the light green components.\n\nI will have to finish it fully for the remainder of the narrative as I left the game and had to start again due to there being no save function.\n\nI enjoyed what I played, especially at the very beginning.\nI adored the focus on empathy and thoughtforms.\n\nI recommend this game for the time and effort put in from the developer. It is a bright looking point and click solver and the art really is something to appreciate.\n\n- Nerf","December 23, 2015","true","1.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
