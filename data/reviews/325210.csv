Finally. Or 13yo camp-snipers. Those two aspects alone are reason enough to buy it. It's permadeath, for you, and your dogs, and you are the village 'champion' - if they run out of supplies, they can die, and you lose. GG. Game over.\n\nI say 'zen-like', because of the pacing of the game, I'd like to say that things happen slowly, but it's more like there are interesting things to do, interspersed with time spent admiring the scenery as you look for the next area to loot. Also, you learn that you can choose your engagements - animals (prey and predator) have an invisible circle around them - stay out of it, and you can leave each-other alone. (however, they are also meant to be your main source of food, so it's a matter of choosing the engagements that you want to).\n\nOverall, its a very enjoyable experience, just being out there, just you and your dogs, exploring new stuff, finding lighthouses and windfarms and all kinds of interesting Landmarks. It's the overall 'feel' of the game that will bring me back again.\n\nGraphics:\nSimple, clean, beautiful (especially with the dawn/sunrise updates)\nFoxes look too much like wolves from medium distances.\ngame seems to need optimisation - for the tiny amount of what's going on in the game, it seems to draw a LOT of GPU cycles\nmany models feel too simplistic - mostly the people and their animations. Especially the 'dead' ones you come across - they look wonky. But it's not a deal breaker, and it's EA, so we shall see.\nYou can turn the render distance of trees down, and that helps a lot.\n\nCombat:\nJumping off the sled, pulling a weapon, and releasing a dog is difficult to  do, especially inside the small-ish detection radius of predators. without a little planning, that will get you (or your dogs) killed.\nBullet travel and drop are a thing, but difficult to judge as you can't really see their path once they leave your weapon.\nNo auto heal and med supplies are finite in the world (for now)\nYour dogs have to be set to the right mode: attack for prey and Defend for predators, else they will ignore them completely and won't even defend themselves.\n\nSurvival.\nAs I said earlier, it has a slower pacing, feels more focussed on exploring the map and scavenging than on  getting into fights - but that makes fights more immersive, as you do them because you have to to survive - for food for your village, rather than because some zombie wants a Bloody Mary for breakfast, or a Wolf decides it want to set your base on fire  :dshound: . That one aspect changes this into a true survival game, as opposed to the survival/horror genre we have become so used to. there is a day/night cycle, and sleep is a thing, But the only reason to sleep in this game is that is how you update your save-point. There are no other benefits ATM. Also, remember to pick up your bedding before you go, or you won't be able to camp/sleep int he wilderness until you find it again.\n\nSound;\npretty good, adds to the ambience. There are a few moments in the sound track which are out-of-place, but these have been brought to the dev's attention, and they have said it will be fixed (children laughing at the end of one of the tracks - it's the creepiest thing you can imagine when you're supposed to be out there alone...)\nYou can turn off the start/stop whistle sound, Whew. I'm thankful for that one.\n\nBugs/crashes/EA issues\nIt has a couple of bugs,  the most consistent one is that if you let your dog off, whilst on ice, he falls through it, and cannot reattach to the sled, meaning you cannot move the sled, creating a catch-22 that ends your run.\nImportant items, critical to your survival are finite you can run out of stuff you need to survive. eg. You need matches to cook food. there are only 103 matches on the entire map. I know, I searched it (and made a map, too)\nMedkits, bandages (to stop bleed out), bullets and bolts... all finite.\nThe compass isn't useful enough - if you set a new waypoint, you will not be able to find home base again (unless you made a map...) And it doesn't show NSEW.","September 11, 2015","true","40.3"," 67 of 71 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","67","71","0","3"

That's the best I will ever be able to describe this game.\nThe developer, a one man crew, is planning to release the game with a single player mode, as well as a 4 co-op player mode. Either way, the maps are so big, I'm pretty sure you'll have a hard time finding anyone anywhere! This leaves you with four best friends, your dogs. Your dogs will live and die for you, and you will live for them, and die without them.\nEternal Winter is a survival game where you've to make sure you survive, but you also have to make sure your dogs survive, or else you can be damn sure you'll be the next in line.\n\nGraphics wise, the game is very cartoonish, but the movement are very fluid. There's a possible tweak here and there, but not even close to being a game breaker.\n\nThe soundtrack will make you feel isolated, with only your four best friends around, and no one else in the whole wide world.\n\nTo resume all of the above, Eternal Winter is a great game, and an even greater one when considering the one man team, which keeps pumping out updates, and good updates I must say (/points to the dogs coming out of the sled to help hunt).\nYou'll either love, or like this game, there's no hating, unless you've serious problems, or simply don't like survival games. There are no zombies, there are no sharks and there is also no one else around (at least for now), but you'll never feel alone.\n\nMy previous review can be viewed on the spoiler tag.\n\nI'll try to keep it simple, as I know I can't be as funny and original as most, if not all, as the other\nreviewers.\n\nSo, here it is.\n\nI adore this game. I wish I had more time to play it.","February 5, 2015","true","3.6"," 63 of 71 people (89%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","89","63","71","6","0"

Set in a harsh winter environment, survive and take care of both yourself and your huskies, and mine goes by the names of John Wick, John Madden, John Doe, and John Snow. *happy face*\n\nNow, it's going to be said, as I said it too, "it looks like The Long Dark", so let's talk about that.\nBoth share similar art style, but one is using cel-shading and a cartoon direction, that being TLD, and the other is using a simpler style with a focus on shades and shadows on its objects. Both are set in the same setting, a harsh winter environment, but EW is more open in it's world compared to the narrow structure of TLD. Both are survival games, but EW is more simple in its approach with more easy and fluid controller system in comparison to how more feature focused, more hard and complex TLD's gameplay system is.\n\nI can keep this going for a while, but to rap it up, Eternal Winter and The Long Dark are very similar to each other, but also very different with their approach and structure of the games.\n\nThe game itself looks nice with its simple shaded graphics, but obviously it still need much work. I like it's simplicity, it's graphic style, and it's openness, but I don't like how it feels bland, and how there isn't much to do in it yet. There isn't much 'things' to do or look at in the game, just going from one point to another to check for supplies for your and huskies survival.\n\nI want to see stuff that will make the game more lively, more interesting to explore in, like adding more creatures to the game, and not necessarily hostile like birds, rabbits, bears that attack once attacked, and other environmental structures like a rabbit hole, or a cave, maybe a fairly big lake that's iced where you can cut a hole and start fishing, with mountains surrounding the area.\n\nAlso the building in the game, while i do enjoy how they're open with no loading in them, they all feel like cheap plastic, even that not run down ones feel hollow, it doesn't look like a place where any one would live or take shelter in. I hope it's made more closed, more texture and details in it, I want it to feel more closed in and not so open that i can see everything in it from 20 meters away. Doors and windows won't hurt too. I hope they add music soon by the way, from the trailer it sounds nice.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRFQKlm2Hxw\n\nIt looks like I'm bashing on the game, but I'm just giving my honest opinion, giving feedback to make the game as awesome as it can be, and doing this conveniently while it's still really early in development. I like the game, and I don't have an issue with the price for what you get in the game, aside from being extremely plain at the moment, I'm keeping myself neutral on whether or not to get the game. If you want to give feedback and see the game flourish, then by all means get it, if not and want a good experience then wait until beta/release, like with all in development games.\n\nShameless link[www.ksalue.com] to original post.","November 24, 2014","true","1.2"," 67 of 82 people (82%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","82","67","82","4","0"

I am thoroughly enjoying it. Much slower than all the other survival games out but a very chilled out gaming experience indeed. Cannot wait to see where this goes in the future.\n\nI got it in the sale for just over £2 and thought its an absolute bargain too at this stage its at.\n\nTake very good care of your dogs as they are your life line. Keep them fed and watered and monitor their health if you use any for tanking or hunting prey.

Collect 5 water bottles for the survivor.

It's probably the best survival type game I've played. The map is large, the since of adventure is really here, the graphics are done just right. What's cool about this game is you build up your village to produce things such as wood, water, metal, etc. so your village can survive. In addition you have to hunt for food and bring it to the village before the next storm hits on day 6, 15, etc. Each time the number of what is required to survive the storm increases. You can build multiple villages with lumber mills, etc. to help out i production. There is a decent amount of wild life as well.\n\nThe controls work well (W, S, A, D, and then E to interact). Until the 2/5 update you have to use P to get to the menu instead of escape like other games. I have run into some bugs like sometimes one of the dogs disapears when I have more than 1 hunter dog (dogs 3 and 4 in the back), so I'm trying to use one hunter dog for now.\n\nI definitely recommend this game. It will get better as they add more maps, etc., but this game is not one of those boring survival games where you don't have goals, and the adventure/exploration part are nicely done.\n\nEDIT: 2/10 They've now added more areas to the map. :)","February 1","true","11.3"," 19 of 23 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","19","23","0","0"

The developers go as far as to say that "The Long Dark" is what inspired them to develop "Eternal Winter" in the first place.  While you'll run across familiar foes like wolves and still have to manage your personal stats like hunger and fatigue, the game promises a less hardcore approach to it all.  It'll support co-op and vehicles, features that "The Long Dark" doesn't have.  You can even name your dogs and go dogsledding...how cool is that?  "Eternal Winter" isn't as polished as "The Long Dark" currently, but I'll be anxious to see how it develops over the next year.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUw-t1qa1ZA","November 24, 2014","true","1.5"," 20 of 27 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","20","27","0","1"

And it is, without a doubt.\nEternal Winter is a raw project with fantastic and promising ideas and is obviously being made with soul behind it and you can easily see it by looking closer at the details of the world or simply listening to the acoustic tunes while riding your sled in the tundra.\n\nAs a surviror in this harsh, post-apocalyptic world, your main goal is not only to survive, but to also keep your tribesmen alive by all possible means. Unlike the other survivalist games that try too hard to be gloomy and edgy by pressing your really hard into their depression, this game and its atmosphere don't do that at all, but rather accept that fate and harsh reality all around you, as if saying - yes, all it's gone, yes the conditions are harsh beyond any reasonable measure, but the life goes on and we all have to keep moving. This is one of my favourite ideas and if we are going to see some story, plot in this game - this one might be one major cornerstones of the plot and the core of this game.\n\nThe idea of riding the sled with faithful and loyal dogs, which you can name, is also rather fresh and not only gives you a better means of travelling/scavenging, but it also simply makes you feel better and not lonely, which this will make you feel a lot, trust me. Although their functions are mostly basic at this point (riding the sled/following you/attacking/defending etc), this another great idea might become an incredible feature later, if given enough support.\n\nBut wait, there's more! The game actually implements something I've been waiting for far too long and does at its current state rather well - the strategy/adventure elements. The goal is to keep your tribesmen alive by not only scavenging for meat/bullets/medicine and the necessary, literate people, but also make sure the village has enough resources to mantain itself therefore allowing you to build different building, objects, traps all over the world. The only thing left wishing is for devs to implement the RPG elements by adding different survivalist skills/relations between the NPC etc. But it's a long way to that.\n\nIf you read carefully enough, you might have noticed me mention the word raw a bit, Because it is. While I deeply like the game, the ideas and the progress so far, I have to mention the problems that are obviously there. It's rather unfair to demand from the devs excellent models/animations of characters or sound design, these ares require high profile and experience, so this is not that much of a problem. But when the dog "falls through the ground" permanently thus leaving your dogsled with a vital part of it (if all the dogs are gone, so is the dogsled and ALL resources you've gathered so far. And you can't get the dogs back) or some glitches by pressing ESC and Q right after another thus messing the controls of the whole thing a bit or having a negative total mass in your backpack, though to be fair it didn't break the game yet. Some questionable design choices, like when you ride the dogsled, you're fully immersed in this cold, deadly place, but when you leave it - there are GIANS icons of the animals all over the lands. I assume so you could easier notice, but it breaks the immersion and makes it look rather weird.\n\nDespite all of this (there are more very minor things that make it a not ideal experience) I wholly recommend this game, because even at the current state - it's a fun and immersive game. I only wish at this point that we had more often updates and full guide from the devs. There are three early access games, which I've ever bought and needless to say it's one of them.","February 5","true","5.7"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

I watched the trailer, nearly died of anticipation while waiting for the release date, bought it the second it was available, and was thoroughly delighted. I will never have any regrets on that front; if I could only ever play this game as it stands now, I'd be getting far more than my money's worth. My computer's a bit of a failure, but this game runs incredibly smoothly on it; beautifully, I'd say, and is updated consistently and with truly exemplary care, thought and communication. In other words, not that I know a single thing about game development, it's being done precisely right.\n\nA unique, poignant, and visceral a-roaming of the frigid, haunting and exhilarating post-apocalyptic wilds awaits you. If you grew up (again, like the dork that is me) running around icy landscapes wishing you had a dogsled and nobody to tell you to wear your mittens, it's a thrilling dream come true.\n\nBut...wear the mittens.","January 12, 2015","true","8.6"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","82","14","17","3","0"

Whether you buy in now or wait for release is up to you, but I personally feel there is more than enough content to keep you occupied for at least 10 hours, but this truly depends on the type of gamer you are.\n\nI recommend this game based on the potential it has. People throw that term around a lot, I know. I am reviewing this on the 25th of November, the release date therefore it is far from being a complete game, but if you are looking to fund something that will one day provide you with hours of entertainment, look no further. If you are after a game that will be fun to play right now, add this to your wishlist and wait for the full release.\n\nPros\nMinimalist graphics that are aesthetically appealing\nAcceptable world generation\nRandom spawns\nRandom loot generation adds replayability\nSuperb atmosphere\nThe dogs add a unique dynamic to the game\nDogs have many uses\nSled has many uses (carry loot, etc.)\nNaming your dogs helps grow personal attachment to them\nSteady learning curve\nLow system requirements\nImpeccably smooth framerate\nCons\nNo music/ambience noises\nSounds are unfinished and sometimes feel out of place\nVery scarce amount of loot/buildings\nNot much to do other than sled around looking for buildings\nNot much variety in map\nGlitches but none gamebreaking so far\nBelow I will go over a few of the points I made above that require more clarification.\n\nMinimalist graphics\nBut Moses, what do you mean, "minimalist" graphics? Well my dear fictional, rhetorical gamer that has been used as an example for my selfish reviewing purposes, what I mean is that the graphics aren't particularly detailed, but they are still appealing. Just by looking at some of the screenshots you can likely tell that this game is pretty, but not because of the HD next-gen graphics. The graphics are very unembellished. Trees look like trees, snow looks like snow, but if you take a close look you can see that it is just a very humble texturing. I am personally very attracted to this style of art but I know a lot of people who do not share my enthusiasm. In the end I suppose it is up to your personal preference.\n\nSteady learning curve\nThe learning curve in this game is very balanced. Over the hour or two that I played the game I was still learning things, but all of the things I needed to know to survive were all somewhat facile to learn. I personally liked this. No mucking around googling how to do things, I was just playing the game and learning as I went. You spawn in and are given a list of controls that seem overwhelming at first, but upon inspection you'll notice that they are all very similar to other games you've likely played. Shift sprints, tab opens the inventory, just like a lot of other games. Upon opening the inventory I was presented with a few self-explanatory buttons that I understood as I clicked them. Upon finding loot I opened my inventory and scrolled through my inventory until I found the item and I immediately understood what it was for. For example a can of food, a crossbow or matches were all very self explanatory and easy to use.\n\nVery scarce amount of loot/buildings\nBut Mooosseessss the point of the game is that it is hard to survive and that food/items are scarce. You are correct, yes, and I appreciate the need to keep food a scarecity in a game like this, but honestly I was just traveling across a very large snowy plain for minutes at a time without seeing anything more than trees and snow, and considering the weather doesn't appear to have an affect on your health just yet, I didn't feel any particular urgency to find somewhere to hunker down.  I feel like there needs to be more to do rather than just riding endlessly across a plain of snow looking for houses to loot. This being said, I do think the developer will have a very easy time defeating this issue as he has a lot of options.\n\nSummary\nOverall I do not recommend this game for anyone looking for a game to play right this second, though I do believe it is a great investment. It is on sale right now and the game definitely has the foundationsto be a damn good game. Hell, the game as it is is quite fun, it is just lacking a lot of the fundamentals that are required to make the game rewarding to play. The world feels very atmospheric but also very empty at the same time and the audio in the game can be awkward to listen to at times.

At the moment though its just a basic survival game and by that I mean basic, eat, drink, sleep. There is very little in the game other than to do this, it's your sole goal and aim. There has been parallels drawn to The Long Dark, but any survival in the snow will and to be honest this game feels a lot more open, your character and situation feels full of hope, not the 'it's not a case of if but when will I die' that The Long Dark gives you.\n\nYou have 4 dogs to pull your sled, you have to keep them fed and watered too. And this is the first thing that doesn't fit, you only seem to be able to feed the dogs meat (which you get via hunting). Now I have an Alaskan Malmute and it'll eat anything, as most dogs will. OK I don't feed it anything in the cupboards but if you're in a survival situation and you have to keep your dogs alive to live then I'm sure they wouldn't turn their nose up at a loaf of bread and tinned beans.\n\nSecond is the hunting, I hit a wolf with 3 arrows and it didn't show any signs of giving up...in fact it killed me. Ducks are a easier target, I've seen deer but never had a crossbow at the time to attempt a kill.\n\nAs the only thing to do seems to be to search houses and cars looking for food and water (and maybe a gun and crossbow) then it gets repetative quick, especially as the content and map seems to be static (eg on the times I've played a new game I always start in the same place and the houses all have the same items). In fact with the game in it's current state you only have to focus on finding 1 thing, a hunting weapon. Without this you cannot hunt and provide raw meat (the only thing your fussy dogs will eat). If your dogs die it's pretty much over. Once you have a weapon then you have meat, you have snow to boil for water and it's pretty much 'I win', there is little else to drive you to continue playing at this point other than the RPG voice in yoor own head.\n\nIt's early alpha and all this could change, the game is at a delicate point in it's development. I feel it was designed more as a 'working demo' and now it's getting a following the dev looks lost as to which way to continue with the game and what to make it into. A sandbox crafting/survival or a story driven game. There is no road map and he is actively asking questions like 'What should I do next?' This could either be a game driven by gamers into a great game or simply a mis-mash of a game that doesn't know what it's trying to be.\n\nIt has masses of potiential and even at this stage is very atmospheric. Depending on the dev's focus it this could be a cult classic. It's worth jumping in and investing in this at it's current price before it increases and seeing what it turns into.","February 22, 2015","true","5.0"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

Not only surviving yourself, but sustaining a village community and currently 4 pups.  I love how you have to go out and hunt/search for items to bring back to camp but there are a few issues I have with the current state of the game.  A few things that don't quite make sense, and definitely several bugs and lack of explination as to how things should work.\n\nYou are able to pick different traits for the dogs but I still have not figured out how to hunt with them.  My dogs either stand by and watch me get eaten (even though I have one on attack and follow), or don't understand the concept of chasing animals like geese and fox.  The only successful animal I am able to attack with the dog is boar (2 meat!).\n\nI feel like there are too many houses for how little you can find in them.  I searched a community of about 20 houses and only found a book of matches and some arrows.\n\nYou start with an axe, and there are a ton of trees around, but you can't chop them down.  In order to get wood, you have to build a lumber shop which currently seems to spawn 1 piece of wood per day.  What I find really cool is that you can't build multiple lumber shops next to each other, they must be 400m apart.  I would be even more behind this if instead of starting with an axe, you start with a hunting knife.  Just makes much more sense.\n\nTravel is pretty fluid, graphics are very nice for the style.  Game works and is playable to a degree but when you get attacked by an animal, and your "best friend" doesn't jump in to help, you are dead.  Very frustrating to die that way.  I have yet to kill something with an axe before it kills me.  Often times it doesn't even feel like I'm landing hits even though im swinging an AXE at this animals HEAD.\n\nWill definitely revisit this game after a couple updates!","October 3, 2015","false","2.2"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","13","20","0","0"

We hitch up, I whistle and we're off. It's cold, deserted but beautiful. Eventually I come across abandoned houses, shops and garages. I find some basics, chocolates, water and even some bread. I vainly try and chase down a fox... without even knowing how to hurt it but it's much too wily.\n\nI eventually find a crossbow... but there are no bolts to be found, I unhitch a dog he follows with true loyalty, we spot a goose and HE'S OFF! He is swift, he catches up and takes a swipe, then pounces and we have lunch but only for two and there are five mouths to feed. Plenty of water, we all drink and I eat some chocolate and beans though feeling guilty my pack cannot eat yet.\n\nWe set off again, there is a watchpost on the hill and it'll give good sightings. We sight another abandoned village and there are crossbow bolts in the tower, what luck. Down the hill to the new town, nothing but scraps... I figure out I can search the trunks of vehicles... if only I'd realised sooner. There is a boar it's charging, one shot it's raging... two and it's down. Bolts plucked from it's hide and skinned my pack will eat today. They've earned it.\n\nWe return in the twilight before dark, the sky turns green before sleep. Off early in the morning  to a new direction, there on a hill is a majestic Deer, standing proud in full rut. He charges when I get close... he's faking and dashes away, 1 bolt shrugged off... he's far now two and down! The bolts went deep and cannot be found but we have dinner today.\n\nThere is a roar and a bear bolting across the snowy field out of the trees. Confident in my weapons I do not even unhitch a dog... take aim and the bolt flies true... but the bear doeast care, it skitters off his massive thick hide... I am backing up now scared, two bolts skittering off this giant monster... lying on the floo being mauled... if only I'd unhitched one of my faithful pack. If only I'd not been dumb enough to think a crossbow could defeat a bear.\n\nYou survived 0 days.\n\nSecond attempt I choose a hunter, a tank and 2 swifts and spwan in an unknown place, it's smaller there isn't much inside so we head out ... there is a howl and a wolf is coming I jump straight to my sled and whistle, We're off but the wolf is relentless... oh the woes how could this be I only just started and nature is trying to eat me. I take a breath and hop off, unhitch my closest pack and he valiantly defends me, killing the wolf and securing them all dinner. I am half dead but he fought bravely and deserves every bandage I have, he's alive and we're all safe... and he was only a swift!\n\n\nLesson learnt, never go anywhere without one of your pack and never fight a bear with a crossbow!","March 22, 2015","true","1.7"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","1"

The art style is quite nice and fits well with the atmosphere of the game. As of this review there isn't much to it which means it's bare bones however the map seems to be very big although I haven't explored in 1 direction for that long so I'm not sure how long it goes for.\n\nThe main basis of the game is survival with dogs and for now you can name, feed and bandage your dogs. Oh and they are attached to a sled which you can ride! Which is pretty cool. There are other animals aswell, for instance, I found a boar that attacked me, I would have killed it but a small ammo reloading bug made me lose all my arrows.\n\nBugs\n\nThroughout my time playing I have come across few bugs, one in particular is pretty hilarious which is where changing the graphics quality makes NPC's and your sled float into the air, spam it and weird stuff will happen. I also died where my screen faded black then suddenly un faded and I was then able to fly by spamming spacebar. Others are minor such as clipping through trees at a certain angle. Obviously these will get patched in the future.\n\nConclusion\n\nFor now there isn't much to the game other than barebones survival with dogs but the game does have HUGE\npossibilities for the future. I believe this game will turn out great but for now I would wait a little while unless you want to support the developer. I give the game a 8/10 for being a good solid Alpha with only few bugs.\n\nYouTube Video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjcC9yld2zQ","November 24, 2014","true","0.7"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","12","19","0","0"

When I write a new story/book it is often somehow tied to autumn/winter. So, when I see a game named "Eternal Winter" I'm totally on board to give it a try.\n\nEternal Winter is truly an enjoyable, atmospheric, and immersive game. While the graphics may seem cheap or low quality at first glance, after playing for a while you will begin to notice the beauty of the world created here. The changing times of day, the weather effects, and the simplicity of the graphics and objects gives the game an almost hand brushed feel. That, along with the music, creates an experience that will make you feel cold--even sitting in the warmth of your own room. And occasionally coming along a dead and frozen body can be a strangely disquieting experience.\n\nNow, with those things being said, there are a few initial things I found that are bothersome--keeping in mind this is an early access game. First of all, there are occasional problems with the text boxes in the game. Sometimes words overlap, get cut off, or disappear off the side of the screen. This can make updates, instructions, notices, item names, etc. hard to read at times.\n\nSecond, I can never seem to find a way to exit the game proper once I have started. It may just be I missed something, but I always have to hit my Windows button to exit the game. Hitting the esc does nothing. I tried a bunch of different keys and buttons with no exit or return to main menu option.\n\nThird, there is a map of the game world which will need to be referenced often. However, you CAN'T view the map while riding the dog sled. If you want to check the map you have to whistle for the dogs to stop, hop off the sled, open the inventory menu, and then open the map. It would be preferable to open the map with one keystroke from wherever you are at the time.\n\nFourth, there is A LOT of open space in the world. It would be nice if there were a few more places, landmarks, embellishments to make the longer stretches of snowy landscape interesting.\n\nLastly, there was a lot of detail spent on making the dogs, objects, ice, sunsets, etc. look good. I emphasize the dogs because they are very good looking models and fit into the world well. However, the other "people/villagers/survivors" etc. are really poor looking. They all look exactly the same and the design is odd. It doesn't fit with the rest of the world here. They are sort of jarring and can break the immersion at times--especially when one of them is just standing in the middle of nowhere like they've got nothing better to do. I'd like to see a variety of other people, women, men, children, of different sizes and shapes. And I wish they would look a little more realistic like the dogs. Even just one male and one female model or at least changing the color of the jackets would be an improvement over what we currently have.\n\nIn the end my one main wish for the game would be to have multiple maps, or to have a way where the world is randomly generated when you begin a new game. It would add some interest and variety to the game.\n\nI can't compare this game to The Long Dark since I have not played the later--although I would like to at some point. However, based on looking at gameplay and screenshots, they seem awfully similar. Eternal Winter, at a glance, appears as the poor man's version of The Long Dark. However, that doesn't mean Eternal Winter doesn't have merit. It does. It is an extremely enjoyable and immersive experience. And, at the moment, it is fairly inexpensive.\n\nSo, if you enjoy immersive games, atmospheric games, survival games, or just plain enjoy winter time, you'll probably enjoy this game.\n\nEDIT: Just wanted to point out that there is now a varitey of different types of people in my village and throughout the game, including women, children, and men. Whether they were there before and I just missed them or just added in I'm not sure. Either way, it is nice and adds to the immersion of the game.\n\nAlso, as a side note, I get occasional drops in frame rate whenever I'm close to or inside a building.","December 1, 2015","true","1.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

With the earliest stages still being very basic  it still has such a great atmosphere and captures you in its vast basic beauty with rich smooth gameplay. What this survival game does, that no other survival game does, it gives you that overwhelming sense of protection and companionship with those dogs! The whole entire time I play I just want to do right by my pups and make sure they are fed and safe. Come into my first small village, whistle my dogs to a stop and go around to unhook luna from her harnest to journey with me further into the small village, shes my hunter and then... *YELP* I cringed inside literally.. I hear one of my dogs yelp in pain as we were leaving and I turn to see Marx getting mauled by a huge white wolf! I felt Marx's pain in my bones it was awful!\nI unleashed the attack mode on Luna dog and she and Xavi went to town on that wolf! Although Marx escaped with minor injuries, I was so mad at myself for not being able to protect my buddy! What I wasnt expecting but what really sealed the deal for me supporting this game is it gave me that same awesome rush that other survival games do in that moment; Like in DayZ for example, your traveling through a city and every thing seems calm, you feel safe to a point, and... that first crack of gun near by or that bullet whistling past your ear, it just makes your heart drop for a second and that is exactly what I want in a survival game.\n\nNo other genre then survival games give you that burst of adrenaline and energy through sets of dynamic situations played out over the course of a game with the addition of that I dont want to lose it all feeling in your gut.\nSome survival games capture that, some survival games don't, and then theres the gems like Eternal Winter.\nI support Eternal Winter one hundred percent, and personally can't wait for further develope and watch it unfold into the complete game you can clearly see it is going to be.\nSupport Eternal Winter people!","February 28, 2015","true","4.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/blackenedsoliloquy/recommended/325210/","blackenedsoliloquy","Kaddock","http://steamcommunity.com/id/blackenedsoliloquy/","242 products in account","Early Access Review\n\n*EDITED DEC 6 2015\nI just checked in after a couple of months and the game has really changed for the better!\n\nThe town actually means something and can produce its own resources with your help, the flow of the game seems to be a lot better with the new looting system as well. All in all, this game continues to impress with each new update! I can't believe how far we've come from aimlessly sledding the wastes to be eaten by wolves or starve to death to actually having a purpose and people to provide for. :-)\n\nAnd now - BUGS that just really f-ed up my gaming experience today:\n- I went to sleep the day after a storm (new game, day 6 storm) and awoke to find my water storage and wool barn had just disappeared, which sets me back a lot of wood and metal and kind of screws me... my wood mill was still there.\n-One of my dogs seems to be possessed (front left dog, default dog type and name) - I had a medpack in his fourth inventory slot which allowed me to exploit infinite med packs! Great, except when I turned them all into med boxes for the town, the weight (68 lbs or something) stayed with me, meaning I am infinitely encumbered - instant karma for exploiting?! LOL\n-That same dog did a flip as I backed my sled into the town to drop those med boxes off and simply disappeared. I tried to see if I could still interact with him even though he was invisible and I couldn't. The sled works fine but I think my dog just basically "died". I'm not sure since I haven't lost one another way yet.\n\nAll in all, still LOVING THE GAME!!!\n\n\n*EDITED REVIEW AFTER MAJOR UPDATE August 11, 2015\n\nThe graphic updates are really showing some shine! The water / ice looks really nice and the game is looking more interesting and also the addition of props (dressers, more cars, tables) is a nice touch, even though almost nothing is interactive at this point. It's awesome to see the villagers and houses and feel a sense of purpose and shelter, unlike the unforgiving wastes in the Long Dark (one of my favorite games right now). Your game is definitely showing that it is not attempting to compete with TLD which is cool, by the way.\n\nI'm not hating, but I found the game to be nicer on the eyes yet boring on the mind after the new update and here's why (I know everything's temporary but I'm just reviewing my latest experience):\n--The dogs don't seem to work as well as they did before - for example, my hunter won't run after animals and kill them when they are in range anymore (crappy)! Even worse, my tank does not attack before I put him directly between me and danger, even though he's in "attack" mode...\n--The addition of the village is nice, but more stressful than interesting. That's mainly because in the last half hour or so of playing I found a huge town with nothing but a water bottle in it - no food crates, let alone food to eat while I search. Please bring the items back ASAP. There is practically nothing to give me a reason to return home since I can barely survive! My last playthrough before the update was actually the best run I've had since I bought the game. I was comfortably surviving and even prospering slightly, until a pig killed me! There were many things to find and I want them back! ;-)\n--Not being able to search the bodies of the dead people I find is infuriating. LOL. I do love the addition of the frozen dude in the boat on the river. I tried to talk to him and wasn't expecting a blue face. :-P\n\nHonestly, those are my only criticisms right now!\n\n:-)        Thanks for the update, keep 'em coming!\n\n\n*ORIGINAL REVIEW - January 7, 2015 -\n\nI've been playing for maybe 45 minutes and here are my first reactions-\n-A ton of potential! I feel isolated, bewildered and hopeless.\n-Give me a reason to survive! I found some supplies but am curious yet uninvested.\n-Some items are just too obviously unavailable. I now have 3 water bottles, some arrows and a match book after drinking a water bottle and eating a power bar. I found a lantern half-buried in the snow in a house... I really think I'd feel like I was in the wilderness if I could pick it up and dry it out and see if it lights! The point - I felt jazzed to pick up the arrows; I would feel better if I could have stabbed that wolf in the eye with one instead of escaping! I know you're going to do it but I think a huge part of making your game solid before you enhance graphics, stabilize everything and create a "feeling / story" will be creating a feeling of driven interaction; every item is exciting because each has the possibility of extending my life in your game. Your game is amazing in its own right and I can't wait to see it evolve. I've been playing "survival games" in the hopes of finding one that feels truly open and bewitching - you have the foundation tackled!\n\nMORE THOUGHTS\n-Cop cars could have guns in them; in fact, vehicles would be amazing with more content in general. I've also found a walkie talkie, several fridges, etc which were calling for a touch but unatainable!\n-One waypoint is not going to hack it unless there are visible waypoints that an explorer can associate with. Maintaining a sense of urgency within a\nn environment with distinctive characteristics is something that would make this game explode!","January 7, 2015","true","5.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

So far i bought it about 2 hours ago, and havent stopped playing it, and i still cant! I give this a 9/10(alpha rating) and the only reason i dont give this a 10/10 is just the lack of content, and some of the graphic designs that break immersion.\n\nPros: The dogs. I ♥♥♥♥ing cared about the dogs. They arent just some person who the story tells you are important. One, because there is no story, and 2, you could name them! I just loved i could name them. The game makes it farely easy to take care of yourself, and, in my opinion, the game more focuses on you taking care of your dogs and keeping them fed and healthy. I was actually clenching every muscle in my body when i stepped out of a house and saw a wolf rushing my dogs, and the relief i had when i shot it and patched up Ruby(The Dog).\nMore Pros are that i love the massive landscape, loot is fareley rare, but if you follow a road you can sustain yourself.\n\nCons: Graphics, I love the graphics, but i would be so much more immersed in this game if it had realistic graphics, or atleast semi realistic. Houses are very boring and you dont even have to go into them to see if they have loot. Darkness doesnt really matter, it is really just my opinion that i know most people dont share, i love it when a games night time is actually dark, not just a blue filter over the screen, like i feel is the case in this game. Items are pretty generic, not very important. After about an hour i haad all the food i would probably ever need for me, and the only thing i could focus on was feeding the dogs, which wasnt exactly bad, but seeing as how i had already aquired the rifle, it was kinda just like farming for something in borderlands 2.\n\nIm already in love with this game, it has that amazing feel of being in a massive expanse of openess, and yet you feel so isolated, and i truley love that. As soon as this game is done, i plan on spending a good couple of weeks exploring all it has to offer! :D\n\n9/10 Highly Recommend","January 19, 2015","true","1.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I think I was lucky, but finding tools to hunt is rather easy. You can see that some parts of the snow are a little darker. If you follow them they lead you to houses and resources. Whatever you do, dont try to hunt a bear. Even with a gun. Dosent work out well. You might consider it anyways because animals are harder to find than ceral bars. I wish it had some sort of crafting system in place, but  it dosent seem to have one. So far I see no advantages for wasting matches(really valuable) on lighting a fire and going to sleep seems pointless.

Unlike in 'The Long Dark' there is no fun to be found here at the moment. Avoid.\n\n\nEternal Winter was supposed to be a competition for 'The Long Dark' title.\nThis one is also a 'survival' game set in never ending wintry environment, where you have to tend to basic needs of your character and search for items in order to survive.\nA plot twist here is that you also have a village of a dozen or so totally useless toons to take care of. Instead of just worrying for yourself you also need to provide for the bunch of total social parasites who spent their entire days doing absolutely nothing useful.\n\nSounds fun, doesn't it?\n\nThe game may look cool, but it has absolutely no fun factor. There is no tutorial to speak of. There is not even a page which displays you all the key shortcuts that you will be using.\nDid you know that by pressing ',' button you will advance time forward by few hours, with no prompt or confirmation request?\nMe neither. I figured it out because colour of the sky was changing and suddenly info 'day 1' appeared on the screen.\n\nThis is just a tip of an iceberg. You are given a rifle but no bullets. You are given a crossbow but no bolts. And the only weapon you can use is machette agains wild animals who will kill you in few hits - all while you must fight them in order to get meat.\n\nYour dogs are useless for anything but pulling your transport, they won't fight back against the wolf no matter what.\n\nYou cannot save your game in any other way but to sleep in bed. Going for a long and dangerous trip?\nSingle wild hog can end your adventure - the game features PERMADEATH which in the current state of development is simply criminal.\n\nMusic is annoying as hell, and sound effects aren't that great eitgher.\n\nTo sum this up:\n- no proper user interface\n- no content\n- no proper save system\n- no help and key rebinding - to open main menu you need to press O or P or something\n- no real feeling of survival\n- no AI system for your dogs\n- no reason to help those parasites from village\n- no reason to play this title either.\n\nAvoid. Until all the problems with this game will be fixed, this game is simply not worth your time and money.","January 6","false","0.5"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","44","7","16","2","4"

It genuinely feels like a prototype that hasn't reached any tangible state that would warrant a release.\n\nGood idea, but ideas are cheap. The idea of working with a team of dogs to survive in a harsh environment is interesting at best, but throwing in some camp/community management, along with bland NPCs and lack lustre visuals just makes for a mess.\n\nThe tutorial is a mess. Its an info dump that really just tells you some features and thats about it. Dropping you into the game it really just expects you to do what you want. But god forbid one of your dogs slip into some ankle deep water and they drown somehow and die immediately. The dogs which I'm supposed to care for have no real characteristics and you can name them whatever the hell you want, which naturally means I named my dogs after the Spice Girls.\n\nThe UI and overall feeling of the menus felt very poor. Cobbled together blocks with some standard font broke any minor immersion I had in the game.\n\nIn the end, this is all my opinion. I'd gladly actively discuss my annoyances with the product with the developers but I do have hopes this will turn out rather well.

That box offered me some medicines, anyway i didn't want to take them since i already had bandages in my inventory so i tried to close that window with no success. Maybe an UI bug, i guess nothing serious, anyway, I opened my inventory and, of course it showed right over the box window.

There just isn't enough to warrant staying on the game. I explored and found a gun. shooting something wasn't satisfying and taking the bits back to the village then repeat just doesnt feel like a game.\n\nDisclaimer - I will keep this installed and up to date as I am interested to see where it goes, but for the time being I cannot recommend it.","August 4, 2015","false","0.7"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

This brings the unique feeling of having to care for something besides yourself. I've never seen a survival game do this before, the addition to your dogs as simple as it is brings a lot to the survival aspect. I love this idea and on top of that the simplistic yet beautiful graphics leave a true feeling of being in the middle of nowhere and truly lost. I also appreciate that this is a realistic survival game and what I mean by that is no zombies, no chaos and warfare, just you and your dogs out in the wild.\n\nThat being said this is an EXTREMELY early version, the game is playable sure, but after 30-40 minutes you will have very little to do. I also don't like how easy it is to survive, my pack of 4 dogs took down a bear on their own. In a survival game I like to have a challenge and I hope this comes with future updates.\n\nOverall I think the game is pointed in the right direction but I cannot recommend it to the masses, that being said if you want to support the developer as he is creating the game the project looks good. I wish him all the best.","November 24, 2014","false","1.2"," 15 of 36 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","15","36","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bossgalka/recommended/325210/","Bossgalka","[AoK] Bossgalka","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bossgalka/","615 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nFirst, let me preface this by saying that I am not a big survival genre player, I got this in a bundle. The idea of survival games are fine, and some seem fun to me. This one, however, was not.\n\nMost survival games are the same. You start off with very little, and you find very little, barely surviving. In that sense, this game is as good as the rest. Perhaps it has more scarce resources and you start with even less, but it just isn't very fun. You are in a very hig, very empty, winter wasteland. Occasionally you see a wolf, or a boar, and you might even get a crossbow with no ammo.\n\nThe graphics aren't even decent enough to seem pretty. You are literally going over nothing but white, snowy hills, with the exact same tree copy and pasted everywhere. There are 2 boats, empty houses, (that aren't even fully built) and hardly anything else at all. I don't care about graphics, but if it has no content, it should at least look good, right?\n\nThe only thing new this brings to the survival genre is the fact that you have 4 dogs. So not only is it harder to find food and water in this game, but you need 4x as much to feed your dogs, too. The combat is so basic, even minecraft's vanilla combat was better done. The dogs are so clunky, the sledding, which is what you will be doing 90% of the time, is also clunky. The animations are poor, at best. How this game is even in early access is beyond me. If you can't even fund your game to basic stages on your own, don't make it, imo.\n\nBasically, in short, this feels like an early alpha stage game that is way too early to be in Early Access. I have had this game sitting in my inventory forever, so it should have been into beta by now. If the game had less content than this a couple of months ago, I can't believe he even put it up on the store, it's a shame. It's bland, boring and lacks any "content". I am fully aware of how scarce and open world most survival games are, most of them do have at least a decent amount of content, this one absolutely does not have the bare minimum, imo. The developer couldn't even be bothered to make more than 30 models for his entire game before he threw it up on EA to get money for what is essentially very little.\n\nI might come back and redo my review when it is out of EA, but I can't recommend this game right now. Maybe in 2 years, (at this rate) if the developer actually finishes the game, it might be worth the $10 for HARDCORE survival fans. Even then, I don't see much improvement coming, but who knows.","June 21, 2015","false","0.4"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","3","11","0","0"

[ I consider myself humbled ]\n\nPros : Great devs, consistant updates and bug fixes, great gameplay and really stable game for alpha.\n\nCons : Nothing...\n\nWish it would go online multiplayer with saveable maps but this game is in alpha so who knows where it will go in the next few months/years but in my opinion i think this should be released on Xb-one and ps4 in the future for sure.\n\nI strongly recommend this game to any person who likes survival games and looking for a bit of a challange.\n\n","January 1","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Eternal Winter has this simple yet deep charm to it. You play as what seems like a village leader, thus comes the responsibility to keep your village alive. You go out and seek out every bit of supplies that is needed, you can send out others to do the same. While you are out, you have a beautiful wilderness to explore. Animals are out to get you, but not in an annoying way. Random supplies can be found. This is really what a survival game should be; Simple yet beautiful. 10/10 in my book.","August 3, 2015","true","11.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I spent a short amount of time on this game beucase of some bugs that are minor and  not game breaking, im not going to get into them becuase I want you to play it and not come to this reveiw to determin wether or not you should play it. PLAY IT. There are game mechanics that i have never seen in any other survival game. Now follow your Alaska native calling and supply your village with food.\n\n(sorry for spelling errors)","July 28, 2015","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They've reworked the whole system, making a much better survival game over all. It's a really good game to play, with difficult survival elements to make it a challenge. Get it a shot.","March 9, 2015","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was hard for me to not recommend this game, but as of right now, that is the case.  Not enough to do, and too many game-breaking bugs.  However, it is surprising how beautiful the sky and snow can get in such a simple looking game.  Aesthetically, given the simpleness of the art style, it's still pleasant to look at.\nThis game has a little potential.  I would get it if $6 or under, but otherwise I'd wait.\n\nUpdate 4/10/16: They keep updating the game, and trying to make it better, but it is still unplayable due to game-killing bugs, like one of your dogs going ♥♥♥♥ up for no reason.","September 28, 2015","false","7.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
