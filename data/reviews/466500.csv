Whilst I don't entirely regret my purchase, I honestly cannot recommend this game. Let me tell you why.\n\nThe story goes as follows: A global pandemic has struck and an unknown virus has beaten down billions of people. With only a few left in the world, 2 'friends' travel together to reach an entirely undiscussed location, dealing with whatever troubles they encounter along the way.\n\nWhilst the post-apocalypse scene isn't new, the story, in its own attempt to be fresh, comes across as too vague and pretentious. There's nothing evident at all to suggest the protagonist and his walking partner are in fact, friends. Conversation is sparse between them. You could argue the journey is more important than the destination, but this journey is entirely lackluster and unsatisfactory. Being at the shallow end of the pool in all of these aspects, it simply just falls flat.\n\nControl wise, combat is not the strong point of the game, and that can be entirely forgiven, however, you'll find there is legitmately no use for the knife at all, through the whole game. Gun play is fine, nothing groundbraking, but not poor. Interaction was somewhat interesting, but limited to a little variety of objects in the game world. The head bobbing, which is nowhere near as bad as STALKER's, reflects negatively on the game for a lot of people, especially with no ability to disable it. Walking, and even sprinting are on the slow side, which goes hand-in-hand with the small areas you are able to explore.\n\nGameplay overall, I found to be tedious, and tiring. Most of the game consists of running, or walking with your incredibly slow 'friend' from point A to point B with hardly any deviation or need to stray from the main path. Exploration is kept to a minimum, and the game punishes you with invisble boundaries, barring your way to new and uncertain horizons. Goals aren't entirely clear cut, and sometimes you find yourself wondering aimlessly trying to find anything of value, whilst this isn't entirely bad, add that on to the already mysteriously vague plot and poor story-telling and you've got a recipe for boredom. The survival elements of the game come in the form of hunger and health damage. By the end of the game I found myself excessively packed with food items and loaded with batteries for my torch, I was never really pressured into using anything save the med-kits, which there seem to be very few of, and ironically are the one thing I believe you need the most. Overall, a very weak, and almost unnecessary 'survival' aspect to this game, slapped on merely to support the 'post apocalpyse' setting. The title leads you on to believe that the camera the protagonist wields, serves as a plot device and is instrumental to the game, this is false. The camera is merely another 'tool' in which your character can use to add 'depth'. You never have to use it. On the topic of tools, the knife and axe are both only necessary to proceed through the very occasional door bound by rope or as a device to break into the extremely limited amount of rooms that exist to cater to that purpose. Which I only found myself using the axe 3 times in the whole game. Prior to acquiring the gun, you will never see a reason to use either of them, at all, outside of the specified context above.\n\nThe one thing I can say this game did a good job of was atmosphere. There were a few times I found myself anxious to continue. Two such times are the village at night after the bear attack - which is entirely scripted, and only has one outcome, unless you don't know how to run - and the subway after you are split up with your 'friend'. These experiences were entirely short lived, but well played out.\n\nIn summary, there is little to no replay value. The 'choice' system in the game mainly consists of objects or useable items that can be entirely missed, very much so like the Metro series. The atmosphere being done well does not merit the game a positive review, all things must be considered, and my stance is what it is for exactly those reasons. This notion is reinforced by the fact that the majority of the game is scripted events. Even with the 'exploration', you are confined to such small areas that only serve infuriate you with the absurd invisible walls they host. In the very first 'level' there are 6-7 houses a short distance from your starting position, you can only enter and approach 2 until you are greeted by a pop-up stating: "Do not need to go far".\n\nGraphics aren't a major player for this game, but this can be overlooked. Whatever goal they were achieving, graphical fidelity had no part in it. They are satisfactory, though I believe the lighting should be somewhat, brighter. A lit kerosene lamp in a moon-lit room should illuminate a generous area, but instead, only offers light in a 1 foot radius. Your torch does a less than steller job of lighting your way too. Torches never seem to be done correctly, in any game I have played.\n\nThe game being in Russian is ideal, as ultimately you are in Russia after all.\n\nIf you've read all the way through I congratulate you. To be brief, I can't recommend this game to anyone, maybe with a 50% discount but even then I'd be reluctant. I feel like the game could have been so much better, and the trailers certainly portrayed a game of considerable depth and interest, but their delivery seems to have been the opposite.\n\nYou're better off waiting for this game to go on sale, or better yet, save the money and purchase something else. I can appreciate the effort and intention behind this game, but after completing it and contemplating my journey, it unfortunately leaves a sour taste in one's mouth.","May 31","false","5.8"," 127 of 161 people (79%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","79","127","161","3","5"

But his games were not represented at Steam untill now. And I'm really glad that he's now here, and you, guys, can get introduced with his works. His games are not just amusement. They always have a deep sense. Before 35MM Sergei made his games totally by himeself as Lucas Pope does for example. This game is the first Sergei experience of working with a team and at the same time first experience of entering Steam. Please welcome him.\n\nAs for the game. I've played a while, about an hour. Graphics and atmoshpere are awesome as usual in Sergei's games. And as for story - I don't know why people wrote here that it slow-paced and totally walking simulator (btw, there is nothing wrong with walking simulators, we indie love them if they are unique and atmospherical - and this one is). For the first hour of playing I walked the forest, found some weird stuff, got attacked with bear, got some flashbacks, got a bit of lore and now are serching for a well in night empty country (or how to say "derevnya" in English). I don't think that's slow-paced at all!\n\nPlease use some patience as you always do with small indie atmospherical titles as Dear Esther of Firewatch, or Everibody is Gone to Rupture, or Protheus, or... should I continue?  I love this genre and totally recommend it to other indie-atmospheric-philosophycal lovers.","May 28","true","1.1"," 132 of 181 people (73%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","73","132","181","10","5"

They start off in this forest, where the user has to collect items to pass certain obstacles. Later on the game develops and there are events such as being chased etc.\n\nThere is no real crafting in this game. It is a journey/adventure type of experience. The atmosphere is very well done, and it is not a laggy game by any means. There are a few issues users may have with making it full screen.\nWhen you initially start the game, everything is in Russian so you will have to change the options to English yourself. It's in the settings menu, which is near the top. The first option is to start your game. There ARE english subtitles in the game, however they're not the best. They're good enough to be understandable for native English speakers though.\n\nThe key to this game is how immersive it is. Rummaging through houses and encounters are what engage the user into progressing to the next part. The atmosphere in the game is what makes this game.\n\nSomething annoying you may find is the progression of your partner. He is quite slow and will walk, however that gives you time to rummage through the area of houses and things, but make sure that you don't lose him!\nAnother annoying thing you may encounter is the lack of instruction at some parts. You may become lost or not know what button to press so here:\n\nTAB opens inventory, the numbers displayed in your book show what to press for what item. ESCAPE simply brings up the menu, E interacts with objects and that's pretty much it.\n\nIf you start the game with no events occuring, i.e the opening scene doesn't show, restart your game because the rest of your game won't work very well.\n\nOverall I am enjoying it so far and I think I am about halfway through the game. I have to work tomorrow so I will update when I have completed the game a little later!\n\nEDIT: The game has multiple endings depending on what you interact with and what you do, it has quicktime events, a gun fight, and much more! A WORKING interesting game to say the least. I would recommend it for those who like immersive games with surprises.","May 27","true","6.1"," 233 of 338 people (69%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","69","233","338","15","0"

Something that seems to stalk the two protagonists where ever they go. Exploring woodland, underground and urban areas, you search to unlock what happened to your loved ones. The only downside to this game was i encounted a couple of bugs that required me to restart my game and play back from a previous checkpoint. Also the translation isn't the best.

The atmosphere is unique and very Tarkovskian (you literally feel the influence of his movie "Stalker"). Minimalism of gameplay possibilities is great, spare dialogues are very fitting.\n\nI am playing it in Russian, so the voices acting is pretty good so far (even if there weren't an actually dialogue till now). The absense of background story explanations or such things is very immersive. You forget about meta level playing this game. You are playing not the aftermath of disaster, you are playing just presence with its dangers. The spare sentences and speech lines are very good, being deep without pretension to be deep.\n\nThe forests are very authentical. I know such places, since I roamed alot as a kid across such forests with forgotten villages, broken cars and calm quietness of nature. Graphics are what they have to be: good, smooth, awesome light. You literally want to make photos all the time. It's not a photorealistic orgy like Uncharted 4 or such, but you don't need it here.\n\nShort: everything fits in one piece of art. I don't regret not to wait till sale - because the nature calls. OK, I'll gotta go into the muddy greyness of the forest again.

It's somewhat reminiscent of Metro, but instead of shooting radioactive mutants, I'm shooting pictures with my 35mm camera. And no, it's nothing like Pokemon Snap. However, for a game I had little to no expectations of, I can say I'm pleasantly surprised and constantly catch myself thinking that it's pretty decent for being developed by a single person.\n\nAnd now I'm off the cart and into a new area that can only be described as quintessentially "russian", my friend whose name I have yet to hear marches onward towards our first encounter with other humans. This is where they introduce game mechanics similar to Telltale Game's Walking Dead series, e.g. timers and button mashing. It's obviously not there to create a challenge, rather it serves as an instrument to the game's atmosphere, narrative, stream of consciousness, or whatever you want to call it.\n\nSomething that I keep encountering when I'm playing this game, or in one example, while I was on a short little mission to fill up a bucket of water outside in the dark, is a sense of dread that's not unlike that of a horror game. But what makes this unique over any of those games is that there's this prevailing sense of dread in certain moments, and it's mostly derived from I think is fear of the unknown. Everything about the game is mysterious, from its Russian origin, the shoddy translation, slow paced gameplay, it's all so silently overwhelming. And that's incredibly clever. I think that sums up what this game is to me. It's clever and it's obviously the summation of many hours of love and diligence that only a one man production effort can possibly accomplish. It's not polished, it's doesn't make your eyes pop out, at least not yet. But it's a GAME, whatever that means, and it's interesting and original, despite being yet another post-apocalypse game.\n\nt.b.c.","May 28","true","3.1"," 48 of 67 people (72%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","72","48","67","3","0"

The Atmosphere is really what wins it for this game, its amazing. Truly. Its spooky, its creepy, its dark, the atmosphere is also maybe depressing? in a way but a good way infact, but that is what makes it what it is.

Not because it was lacking interest, but because of the same reason I stopped playing Tomb Raider. The shaky camera gave me motion sickness. I don't understand why developers still do this. Yes, I understand it adds to immersion, but scientifically, it's well known that video motion sickness is real. So in my honest opinion, immersion is not worth your well-being. I wanted to like the game so much, but I just couldn't get past the shaky, first person camera work. Either give the option to stop camera shake in first person, or take it out all together. The game play is simple and in truth, because it's always dark, it does give a very erie feel. However, with no backstory and limited directions, it does move pretty slow.\n\nIf you can handle the camera shake and don't mind a slowly developing story, I would recommend. For an indie company, this is a wonderfully designed game. If you're wanting something like Fallout 4, then you're better off just buying Fallout 4. But If you're not an action gamer and you like story development, then give it a go.\n\nOfficially I'll give it a reccomend because I think this indie developer deserves recognition, but personally, I can't play it anymore because I was getting too dizzy and I've been on it less than an hour.","May 29","true","0.7"," 25 of 37 people (68%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","68","25","37","3","3"

But it has a great deal of charm - the general world design is quite pretty, and I enjoy the quiet nature of trekking through a forest, stopping at landmarks to scavenge for food and supplies, all the while having tension build and build. It feels more like 'The Road' than Fallout in terms of it's apocalyptic design, and to me, that's refreshing. It's a strange feeling being near-defenseless and having to wander through the world, unsure of what will happen next.\n\nSure there are quick-time events and wonky animations, and it could easily be passed off as a walking simulator, but the game doesn't advertise itself as anything else - it's an interesting, almost relaxing game that clearly has had a lot of effort put into it. I especially appreciate the work gone into making English subtitles for the Russian speech; even if they aren't perfect, it speaks to the level of commitment that the developers have had in making this game accessible to a wider audience (although I had to blindly feel through the default Russian menus to change it to English at first!).\n\nThe camera element of the game is also very interesting - taking photos of the surrounding area and buildings reguarly makes for a new perspective on your journey when you flick through each photo chronologically in the menu screen, making every photo feel like a frame from a creepy, found-footage thriller.\n\nIt's a niche game, but a good one at that - if you like more ambient, slow burning experiences, you'll love this.","May 30","true","1.0"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","12","19","0","0"

However there's definitely more to it than that. Yes, there is quite a lot of walking but there are other elements to it such as looking for supplies in empty houses/buildings, getting chased, and some combat. It's no Stalker game, but as far as atmosphere, it is certainly there and very reminiscent. I would highly recommend it for that last point if you did enjoy the Stalker series.","June 3","true","3.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","100","4","4","4","0"

You are wandering through deserted forests and villages searching for food and medicine. Never let your alertness go down, you'll always have the feeling something scary and terrible can happen any moment.\nThere is not much fighting in this game, but nonetheless you get the feeling of the post-epidemic world being a place were you struggle to survive.\nI really enjoy the slow pacing of the game. It feels natural to walk slowly, explore all the places you pass by and take pictures with your 35mm camera.\n\nA downpoint of this game is the translation, a few times it was annoying. However i wasn't bothered by the russian only voice acting.\nAdditionally, you will probably encounter a few bugs here and there, but overall thats not a big problem.\n\nI can definitively recommend it to players, who enjoy slow placed exploring and a relativly open story, which is led only by few lines of text.

The graphics was not how I would expect of, especially when I saw animals and some of the npcs being animated, but I was giving this game a chance, since this was one of the first ever story/post apocalyptic game I have played (most of the time I play things like terraria or don't starve) and that the graphics does not matter if the actual story itself was gripping enough. Talking about that, the story itself felt rather gripping at the time, but had no real plot, and overall I was worrying more about the scenes that would scare me to death because of the unknown. But when I come back to think of it, it did not have anything to interest me, its not the sort of story that would give you so much emotion and give you something to remember about. It gives you puzzles that are hard to solve, and most of the time you are walking. Most of this may not seem like a bad thing, but a proper game should be trying to grip the player. After about half way through the story, the game seemed to tip itself upside down. I spent this half of the game listening to creepy sounds as I would crazily run around, trying to find out the puzzle. Yes, its atmospheric, but it got to the point that it was uncomfortable. It took ages for you to actually get back to the real story and there was no proper guideline as to what to do. I'm fine with a game with really hard puzzles but when it gives you no pointers and then you have to put up with a story which is not interesting, a game that mostly makes you hear creepy sounds rather than solve the puzzle, its just not how it should work. I am currently so close to the end yet I cannot find any solution at all. At some points of the game I had to use walkthroughs to actually solve the puzzles because I was too focused on the fact of how scary it was. Although to some that is fun a) it spoiled the game and b) this game, along with all its other traits, made most of it seem like the game was just trying to creep you out rather than a proper story as to why you should experience this in the first place. It reminds me (remotely) of fnaf, where its just having scary things to 'compensate' for the weak story. The story is like the backbone to a game yet its not there!\n\nThe conclusion:\n\nThe way it scared you was brilliant, but it had no proper story and like I said before, it would just compensate this by adding creepy scense. I'd love to finish the game, but it's overall not convincing enough to go through these poorly made scenes. If it had improvement to the story and such, maybe I would change my mind, but It would probably be better if the price was lower, for it just doesnt have the traits you would want to pay for in this sort of game.","June 5","false","9.0"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","3","8","0","1"

I can see it's merits as a game and why other people do and will enjoy it. I just wouldn't recommend it.\n\nPros first:\n--Everything, game-wise, worked just fine: All the graphics were fine, I found no bugs, nothing glitched for me and my game never crashed. So kudos on that front.\n--It was definitely atmospheric like the tags suggests, and the horror tag I understand as well. The game was more or less as I was expecting (tag-wise)\n--Certain aspects of the game (that I won't mention for spoilers) were unique and I'd never seen before in a Walking Simulator\n\nCons:\n--I didn't personally find it to be story driven until literally the last two minutes of the game where a large chunk of the story is thrown at you at once.\n--My ending of the game left massive plot holes in the game. (I have discovered that there is more than one ending, so perhaps that ending explains more)\n--The two main characters really don't talk to each other enough, making parts of the game incredibly dull. Also with them not talking, you learn nothing about them and as such I found myself not caring about either of them or what happened to them.\n--THE PASSCODE\n\n\nLike I stated above, I don't think it's a bad game per-se, I just didn't enjoy it. I thought it was going okay if a little slow until the ending which I found to be awful. (Like I also stated, I found out there is apparently more than one so maybe that one is better than the one I saw) I really wish that there was a "mixed" option for steam reviews because that's really what this is. Game-wise it works fine, I just didn't find the game that good as I really didn't care about the characters.","June 4","false","4.0"," 8 of 22 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","8","22","0","0"

The trailers and game footage looked promising, but this game was lacking and I personally feel like more time should of been spent on it before it was released.\n\nPros:    Ambient lighting effects were awesome\nEerie setting & atmoshpere was definitely there\nMysterious storyline\n\nCons:    Graphics are not as great as everyone is making them out to be\nOther traveler walked extremely slow and would not stray off of set path\nEXTREMELY LINEAR; you'll actually run into invicible boundaries....\nNo clear instructions most of the time\nSound elements could of been better:\n-At night the sound of crickets drove me mad. It's audio levels way surpaced any other sound levels, which was ridiculous\n-First time I jumped I got startled and thought someone was grunting behind me; you'll sound like a caveman....\n-Walking is just a repetative gravel crunching sound that becomes irritating\nVery little insentive to "Explore" the little there is to explore. It's rather a waste of time rather than a rewarding experience\nOverall: [4/10] Totally requested my money to be redeemed..\n"A" for effort, for an indie game","May 28","false","1.6"," 36 of 83 people (43%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","43","36","83","4","0"

The GUI is practically non-exsistant, I feel they were going minimal but it's just uninformative. This basically makes it very hard to know what you are supposed to do and what you can interact with within the game. To further break any feeling of emersion the voice acting is in Russian, now I don't have a problem with that, it's the rubbish translations that have been provided. In the game play I tried you are plunged in with no idea what's going on and no sense of what you should be doing and tied to follower who goes at his woefully slow pace leaving you to wait at every point to see where you have to go to stop you running into very limiting invisible walls.\n\nMaybe this game would have got better if I'd given it more time but if a good hour it's enough to give me one idea of why I'd want to play this game then you need to rethink a few things.

All these game assets were downloaded from some website with free 3d models and textures, all these sounds recorded by the author in 32 kbit/s in his bathroom. All character animations are comparable in terms of quality with Uncharted 4, I believe they all were captured from the author's mother in the same bathroom where he recorded sounds, and perhaps they have even been recorded at the same time. The dialogues are written by some fen addict who thought something like: "this is how real men talk on my block.. before they start giving each other head". In the game the main character has a "friend" and the first thing that the game does to introduce him is that it shows you that he is a full degenerate with partial paralysis of the legs and all your further adventures will be only in endless waiting for your new barely walking buddy.\n\nThe most funny thing is that this apocalypse does not support screen resolutions higher than 1080p. Mankind has never seen a game with such a performance, and with so many so beautiful pixel on your screen.\n\nAnyway, the game is better than new Doom.","May 31","false","0.2"," 5 of 24 people (21%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","21","5","24","3","0"

Interesting story and I felt the connection between the two main characters. However, I do think the graphics and the stiff movements made the characters in the game not so human-alike so it did not felt so real to me. I would also say that the game would be more fun to play if the graphics were better because the nature was very well done and I love games with wonderful nature.\n\nThe cinematography and the manus script could also be better because the story did not became deeper and deeper the more you played so it was hard for me to feel the feelings the game was meant to make the player feel.\n\nBut I would like to see more games like this in the future! Hopefully with deeper story and better graphics, like "HomeSick".

Actually...I wouldn't call it a "bob", so much as it is a "sway", a slightly hypnotizing sway that is terrible on the eyes; it's like doing sleep REM eye-movements with your eyes open and awake.  I tried moving my mouse left/right in the opposite direction of the head-sway to try to negate the motion of it, but that sucks. The head-sway just hurts my eyes and I'm not sure if I'll be able to complete the game because of that.\n\nThe terrible cut-scenes don't bother me, but not being able to skip them is dumb.\nThe terrible animations and voice over audio doesn't bother me, but not being able to skip the cut-scenes that play them is even dumber (wait...which one is dumb?).\nThe game's atmospheric quality really takes a drag from those cut-scenes.  I would rather sit at a loading screen, even a blank loading screen, than watch those cut-scenes.\n\nNo controller support bothers me.\n\nIndie or not, and at this price, the game's impression it has upon me would benefit greatly if it had:\n- an option to disable the head-sway/bob.\n- controller support.\n\nThe game feels fairly atmospheric; the music and environment audio is pretty good.  The atmospheric quality of the game really pulls me in and make me want to like/review this game, but, as I've stated, there are major things that yank me right out of the game every second.","May 28","false","0.6"," 43 of 143 people (30%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","30","43","143","3","0"
