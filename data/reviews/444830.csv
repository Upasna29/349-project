Can't wait for more parts to be added, either by the developers or via mods. It is a sandbox; so don't expect any gameplay as such (except for a very short tutorial level).","May 27","true","10.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

This is a sandbox game with no other components and its in a very early access state. Keep in mind the following quote from the Developer.\nCalling this a "final completed game" in it's current state would misrepresent the game, and we do not want to upset or disappoint people that buy the game in its current state thinking that it's a final, completed, shelf-ready game.\nPlease watch my video below for alot more information.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/0O9FG0bW1_s\n\nGraphics, Average quality graphically, but very functional and works well for the construction.\nAudio , very minimal, alot of work required on audio.\nGameplay,. Fantastic concept, UI is easy to use, but can be very frustrating, a lot of room to improve on the UI. You can easily spend a few hours in this game making whatever you can imagine, playing multiplayer really opens a lot of potential.","May 27","true","7.7"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","6","9","2","0"

And the game runs at about 120 fps on singleplayer for me and 60 on the public multiplayer server.\nNot optimized for (very) bad internet connections. If the server has too many objects, it's possible you'll timeout.\n\n\nDon't let the cons discourage you, this game is worth trying! You'll love it, I'm sure.\n\n- Engitly","May 27","true","10.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","3","6","2","0"

Now, while I love creative games, this one fell short for me. I'm not sure if it's because of the pretty early state that the game is in, but I think really what did it for me was how frustrating the controls were. And in the end, it really didn't do much more than what other games already do. I kind of don't see a point in playing this when there are so many games that are exactly like this and actually perform better. So maybe you can build really cool big structures with this, but I couldn't see myself continuing to be frustrated by the controls any longer.\n\nI generally do hope that the developers find fun ways to differentiate this game from others, because right now it doesn't feel like an improvement over games I already play.\n\nIf you want to check out some gameplay of this game:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsxpFwcK7mA","June 5","false","0.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I am a trainee electrician and enjoy anything to do with construction and architecture. Just the game for me very impresed and would recomend this game to anyone who likes to use their creative side. :)","June 5","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
