The graphics and physics certainly become better in latter ARMA2 updates and in ARMA3: vehicles respond to rugged terrains, ragdoll systems etc. Yet that is the only thing I feel "realistic" about this game. Other elements are not at all close to real. The map is huge but monotonous(I guess because it's largely computer generated); the way objects interact is ultimately awkward(they still struggle with it in ARMA3); close-up scenario looks beautiful but depth field is very ♥♥♥♥♥♥. These ruthlessly dim the only few other highlights of ARMA.","December 27, 2013","true","10.2"," 16 of 26 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","16","26","0","0"

The missions are fun and it's full of drivable vehicles. Commanding a squad of soldiers is a little tedious because of the clunky command system but you get used to it. Other than that, I rather enjoyed my time in this game. There isn't anything particularly bad about it, the missions were challenging and I died a lot but I did manage to get by eventually. The campaign is non-linear, it gives you simple choices between differing fronts of engagement and those choices have benefits and consequences. I recommend it to anyone who fancies tactical shooters.\n\nPros:Challenging missions\nFull squad commands\nMany drivable vehicles (air, ground, sea)\nNon-linear campaign\nLarge open maps with fairly detailed environments\nInteresting tactical firefightsCons:Some distant sounds will sound like they're near you.\nLarge scale engagements will sometimes resolve themselves before you even get there to take part. I often got lost and had to take detours through hills and towns just to get to the engagement point and by the time I got there, the battle was already won or lost. You need to be quick when you get your objective.\nObjectives are not always clear. Might require some exploring, trial and error.Neutral:Menus/UI feel touchy and don't always respond to the first click\nNo music (for me it isn't a con because I usually turn game music off anyway)\nAI is sporadic at best. It will either spot you from 800m away and snipe you or it will walk in random directions 100m off until you shoot at it. But once you do get it's attention, it seems to do alright in a fight.\nOverall, I liked this game, it was fun.","May 14","true","22.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

They claim to be real but all it is it's a broken game. Realistic games don't need to scroll a wheel to interact with everything. AIs are dumber than a hamster. On top of that making everything hardcore doesn't make it real. They have to learn from America's Army games what is realistic or not. They did do a great job with the map. That is the only thing I like about it. But, no matter what this game feels broken to me. Oh and one last thing. This is clearly an imitation of Battlefield 2.

I love the campaign and the multiplayer (singleplayer) warfare. I've got an Intel processor that this game doesn't work well with, so if you want to play this game, try to find a cracked version of arma.exe on the internet for version 1.14. Version 1.18 doesn't work with Intel graphics.\n\nThis game can be really fun. Some people say it's not too good because of the graphics, but does that really matter? The graphics are fine to me, and the gameplay is awesome! Especially since you can play in 3D. That's what you usually don't see in most FPS games.\n\nIf you're used to games like COD, I don't recommend having the float option on at all; it will make you move around your gun before turning. Since COD doesn't do this, it's a bit harder to get used to if you're used to games like COD. Also; Don't ever expect under-a-second kills. It's not a couple shots with a pistol or half a second of shooting to take down an enemy; even in multiplayer!\n\nSo, overall, it's a very great game, but can take awhile to get used to for COD fans.\nRating: 957/1000","February 7, 2015","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
