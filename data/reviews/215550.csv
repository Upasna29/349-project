The sheer amount of content is very disturbing and the poor animations when running and hitting made the game feel very stale. I got no enjoyment out of slaying all those zombies. It just felt plain and boring. I want satisfaction out of dominating zombies and with smoother animations I think the game would be much more enjoyable.\n\nHopefully this game will be worth coming back to at a later date, but at the moment I can't recommend it.","August 12, 2015","false","0.6"," 73 of 94 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","73","94","2","8"

They could've easily just have dropped the project long ago with the difficulties they were having and I wouldn't have even noticed, so I really admire their dedication to it and the backers.\n\nWith that said, the game still needs a ton of work done on it, but I feel like they have a pretty solid foundation with pretty much all the basic gameplay elements laid out. They really just need to add more of everything, smooth out the controls and combat, and of course do a lot of bug testing and gameplay balancing. The game is pretty playable the way it is at the moment, but lacking so many of the promised gameplay elements you might do everything there is to do pretty quickly and grow tired of it.\n\nStill, if the concept appeals to you and you like these kinds of games, it may be worth looking into and see if you'd enjoy watching it develop into a fully fleshed out game.","July 28, 2015","true","1.7"," 39 of 51 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","39","51","2","0"

Nope.\nDoes it have fun issues like Zombies coming through doors? Yeah, occasionally, But so does DayZ and that's been out since December 2013.\n\nThey're not the same game of course. DayZ is survival and this is, well fun.\n\nYou get to run around as a kid, customize your character to wear gas masks, have backpacks and a dog. Plastic baseball bat? You've got it. Nail guns (not child friendly) they're there too.\nPaintball gun? Yep.\n\nRemember those paper cutters you had in school that you used to be terrified of because you thought your hand was gonna get chopped right off? Well those are weapons too.\n\nIt needs some work, sometimes in Multiplayer you'll get locked in place. Sometimes one of your friends is just floating and sliding about, but on his screen he's being a bad A 3rd grader. No one is judging.\nIt's challenging enough that it holds my interest.\n\nI posted a screenshot and the dev commented. How cool is that? They're paying attention.\n\nit's really easy to get into a game and play when you've only got a few minutes to kill, and if you want to invest more time I'm sure it's the same level of easy.\n\nI don't normally write reviews, but I saw this one had mixed reviews on the first day, and I don't think that's fair. It's fun, Worth the 15 dollars in my book and I've only played for a little over an hour and a half, however, I see myself putting a lot more into it.\n\nIf you're on the fence, watch some gameplay or streams of it, if you're a fan of supporting devs get this, but remember it's in Early Access so as mentioned, there will be some issues.\n\nIf you have no desire to play this then you probably didn't have a childhood where you got to play on a playground and pretend you were saving all your friends from monsters.\n\n","July 28, 2015","true","37.5"," 20 of 26 people (77%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","77","20","26","4","1"

I followed the Kickstarter campaign, the forum updates and finally the Steam early access. I feel like I need an option for in between Yes and No. I like the art style, the options for customization, the music and the a lot of the gameplay. I have a huge problem with the camera work (more on that later) and the seeming lack of story/objective. I understand that this is a work in progress so here is what I'd like to see; the option for story mode and simple run and gun gameplay. More character options. More levels. Achievements.

I love how I customized my character, but that's slightly off-topic.

Anyway, it's definitely a good way to spend your money, even if you can barely afford it.

It's a promising game, but right now it has a few issues that make playing it unenjoyable.\n\nWell, the core of the game at least is in a promising state. Combat is fun enough to justify fighting zombies for hours and there is a fair amount of customization options already in the game. Probably more unlocks than one would be willing to grind for.\n\nThe problem is that in less than 2 hours I've already experienced everything available (apart from multiplayer). Another "bugger" (pun intended) is the framerate as the game runs terribly bad. There are complaints about the camera controls, though I quite like it as it is, provided that performance is fixed at some point.\n\nStill, the dev remains relatively active in the forums so it's not an abandoned project, and once they fix the performance and add a bit more variety in terms of enemies, it would be quite fun to grind for those unlockables.","February 9","true","1.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Yes it is in early access and it has potential, but there are a lot of issues. It hasn't been updated since Halloween and there really isn't that much content. You pretty much get to play the school area over and over for all missions. Online mode bugs out for the person who isn't the host, causing them to force close the game.

Are they not equipped to handle such peril? Perhaps their death would be taken too harshly by the audience? Zombie Playground pulls off the seemingly impossible, delivering superb class-based arena combat featuring children against hordes of the undead. The enemies and environments are endearingly creepy. The cartoon style with its stylistic black blood, serves greatly to ensure that even while eviscerating tens of opponents with a nailgun, the game never feels like it is taking things too far. Just look at the sparkles! OOH!\n\nClass-based means this game is infinitely more fun with a friend or two, but even alone the fluid controls and easy-to-master combo system makes Zombie Playground just feel nice to play. Currently only two classes are available, the Bully which takes on a Berserker role and the Rascal who serves as more of a Scout. The dynamic works well enough, with the Scout finding the path of least resistance and the Bully keeping it clear. However, with only one level to explore maybe double-Bully is the way to go. As more classes are added the game will develop some much needed complexity.\n\nCustomization is extremely vast in this game. Hair, clothing, and accessories abound to ensure that no two survivors will look the same. You can even choose between a few different school-related weapons. I experimented briefly with the level-up system, which gives a fair incentive to continue playing. Eventually you will unlock all of the few available game modes, and find yourself waiting for the next update. There is a lot to love about this game and it is an extremely promising Early Access title, but the variety will need to be stepped up if it hopes to make itself known in the horde of zombie games available today.\n\nI greatly enjoyed my time with Zombie Playground, but lack of variety hurts this game a lot. The difficulty score is flogged by the beat-em-up nature of the game and the sheer amount of items dropped. This games unique aesthetic and fluid controls are what eventually won me over. This game could surely be amongst the greats if it offered a more complex combat system and maybe some RPG elements. If it seems like something you would enjoy, please leave a comment on the youtube video mentioned previously and your name will be entered to win one of two Steam keys. Thanks to Stealth Studios, and I can’t wait to see whats in store for the future of Zombie Playground.\n\nGameplay:\n\nControls- 10/10\nFun Factor- 8/10\nDifficulty- 6/10\nReplayability- 2/10\nInnovation- 7/10\n\nAesthetic:\n\nGraphics- 10/10\nMusic- 8/10\nSound FX- 6/10\nStory/Lore- 0/10\nLevel Design- 7/10\n\nFinal Score: 64/100 for graphics, controls, and fun factor.\nSummary: Arena-shooter about kids cleansing their school of zombies. Oozes style and potential.\nVerdict: Lacking content at the moment.

I clicked on that one assuming it would be a tutorial. No. There is no tutorial.\n\nThe next objective: "Kill 10 zombies". These objectives get larger as you go, with little to no variety. If you enjoy mindlessly clicking mouse1 while facing zombies, this game is for you.\n\nThis is the real kicker though. One of the video settings presets is "ALIENWARE". In all caps.

The game has six different missions to play and challenge your self in the current school area. The equipment option gives a large scale of costumization of your child character, which gives a enjoyment to be the cool kid back in the days. There is currently two classes, which is either a bully as tank or Rascal as a agility class. Every player has a mele weapon aswell for pistols. - And for those who like dogs, then you can get a dog.\n\nWhile playing the game we notice the EA stage has the same design of zombies everywhere besides the bosses. The school environment is damaged and should be any childs nightmare, but with the skill set and feeling of character control, should not stop them to wipe their asses.\n\nOverall, the game has potential where i can imagine that the game has alot to come in the future.

From the awesome character customization, crazy weaponry, and over the top action, Zombie Playground has plenty of good ideas and shows potential. In the audio/visual department, Zombie Playground is also looking nice. While the game focuses more on slime and less on gore, this doesn't stop it from looking really fun and crazy. The characters animations flow well and combat is highly explosive. What Zombie Playground does lack is simply content and polish. The game has all it's ducks in a row, it just needs to turn itself into a game with a cohesive direction. Goals such as kill 500 zombies isn't necessarily dynamic gameplay, however, this is Early access though. Combat and level design need a little bit more polish but are just about where they need to be.

I saw the art cover for it and it looked amazing. Once I saw the main menu I kinda frowned a little. When I got in the game after customizing my character, it wasn't fun. The combat doesn't feel like fun and the ranged combat confused me. The kid's voice annoyed me to the point where I cringed. It felt boring and stale.

Running around a school yard and smacking around creepy zombie kids & faculty with a paper cutter blade is a nice twist to the generic "shoot a zombie" approach. Though in it's early stages, there's a fair ammount of customization to your character's appearance, and I suspect more would be added upon a completed release. So far there are just two classes "Bully" & "Rascal", and personally, I'm hoping for a "Geek/Nerd" class. Perhaps a quirky looking kid who can use a modified Bunson Burner to set his enemies a flame. There's lots of possibilities here and I hope all aspects are fully fleshed out for it's release. Controls could be a bit more solid, and there are the expected hiccups with an early access version, but I believe Zombie Playground can inject a bit of juvinile glee to a bloated genre of gaming that's made me somewhat weary of the walking dead. More classes, More fun weapons, More customization, better control handling and I think it will be a solid release.","August 2, 2015","true","3.0"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

You need a proper currency system, more customization options, allow us to customize our characters faces, style and physique.\nA tutorial from the get go wouldn't go amiss and actual modes, kill 10 zombie to 500 zombies mode is basically the same thing, same ♥♥♥♥ diffrent option which could be done as survival mode,done.\nThis game barely has a frame rate and looks like ♥♥♥♥ for it's style, the camera movement is jerky and aiming with the guns is inaccurate.
