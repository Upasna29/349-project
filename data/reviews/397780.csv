I felt a lot less involved with characters and the story than normal, and things just felt rushed. It's not a bad game, but it might be among the weakest "choice of" games I've played, so I can't recommend it unless you've finished all their other games, and just "need" to play a new one.","September 4, 2015","false","3.0"," 154 of 179 people (86%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","86","154","179","5","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/_tokidoki_ai/recommended/397780/","_tokidoki_ai","Talon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/_tokidoki_ai/","351 products in account","I'll preface this review by saying I love the "choice of games" series and CYOA novels in general. As a standalone CYOA game, I believe that it performs admirably especially when accompanied by a suitable youtube mix (I recommend most epic music ever by HDSounDI). While as a whole, the text was uniformly above average, there were certain sections where I thought that the choices presented and the outcome that results were disjointed or even directly contrary to what I chose. These moments only occured twice, yet it was the first time I've ever encountered an event like that in any of the choice of games series.\n\nWhen comparing this title to previous choice of games I couldn't help but to feel a little disappointed. While the obnoxious use of weird pronouns evident in the previous title "Versus: The lost ones" was not present, the choices presented seemed less meaningful. Directly prior to playing this I played "Choice of the Deathless" and when I finished that, I felt a deep sense of contentment; a belief that the choices I made in the novel shaped how the story unfolded. Sadly, I did not experience anything similar to that when I finished this interactive novel. In fact, I had barely any sense of closure from finishing this, which makes a certain degree of sense due to it being the beginning of a new series but was still quite disappointing.\n\nDue to my profound love of this genre, I would still recommend this game, yet if you are just getting into the choice of series, I would advise you to play choice of robots or choice of deathless first as they are much stronger novels. Following that I would play the greek hero story, then Versus and the heroes rise trilogy. Once you finish those and are still aching for more, there are a variety of text adventures on their website which can be bought easily using google wallet. Basically, what I'm saying is play their other games first, and if you need more then come back and buy this.\n\nTLDR: Yes, but only if you are a veteran to the Choice of games series. Otherwise go buy choice of deathless or choice of robots. They are much better uses of your money and time.","September 5, 2015","true","3.6"," 38 of 50 people (76%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","76","38","50","3","0"

I forced myself to play to a conclusion, where I died, though I'm not really sure what I did wrong. The stat mechanics, though much more simplistic, weren't as intuitive to me as most Choice of Games titles are (Heroes Trilogy, Hero of Kendrickstone, SLAMMED!); sometimes you can use your powers with no or very little ill effects, others you'll do something that seems much simpler and generate a huge amount of fatigue. I basically focused on the powers all the way through, learning more about them and trying to get better at them without overusing them, but I suppose it's possible I was too cautious.\n\nThough I never attempted any of the romance options, I suspect there's likely a lot of content there as is typical of CoG games. Overall, if you're REALLY itching for a CoG style CYOA, this is pretty inexpensive and you might like it, but as for me, I'd say to give this one a pass.","September 21, 2015","false","7.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Yes, I know I gave a thumbs down to it's previous game - Choice of robots - which will make me seem biased torwards text games. However, even though I gave a thumbs down to Choice of robots, I had some fun with it, and at least finished the game to the end.\n\nThis title, "A Wise Use of Time", however, I cannot bring myself to even FINISHING it.\nThe pacing... is slow. Oh my god is it slow. I appreciate the fact that it's trying to build itself up, but it managed to break my will to read another chapter.\n\nBut really that's not the real problem I had with this game. I do not enjoy the fact that the choice of this game is mainly divided into 2 factor. "Good" or "Evil" - like the "Paragon" or "Renegade" system in Mass Effect. I personally hate this, because it over simplifies our emotion and desire. Previously in the "Choice of Robots", you had to choose what purpose you will give to your robot. Will it represent beauty and grace, or will it spread fear and overwhelming power? Or, will it act like a living human being, and become your friend? It was up to you. The world evolved around you, which is the sole purpose of a "text adventure" game.\n\nHere, it's not like that. Yes, it has many branching paths, but the main dilemma is "Will you, or will you not overuse your power to bend time for your own benifit? Consequences may happen." And this alone may be an interesting book or a conversation - but not a game, which is about the "game play". And it feels like the choices that this game presents are not intriguing enough for me to choose this game over a well written book.","September 16, 2015","false","2.9"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

While the concept was interesting, I felt it was poorly executed. You find your character in a number of contrived situations and you get the choice of how, or whether or not, to use your power to stop time. In my first playthrough I chose the options that best represented what I believed I would do, and while I found that the options were (usually) sufficient for that, between chapters I was given a narrative about how my character had been fighting crime and helping people with his power, which was completely contrary to how I had been behaving, as for the most part I'd been conservative with my powers, and those few times I had used it, it was for the gain of myself or my direct friends, not random people on the street.\n\nAside from that, I feel that many of the things that happened were quite unrealistic. For instance, stopping time, doing something, moving back to the position you were in and then starting it again - There is simply no way that you'd be able to get your body back in the exact same position it was in, and to other people, it would appear as if you suddenly jerked in an unusual or perhaps even impossible way, and this wouldn't be ignorable.
