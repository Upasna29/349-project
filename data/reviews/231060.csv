So naturally, when I heard there was to be a sequel, a 3D sequel at that, I was ecstatic.\n\n-Insert several years of waiting here-\n\nThen came the day when I heard Ragnarok Online 2 was available for play. I was stoked. What followed was roughly 45 hours of the most generic game I've ever played and refused to finish.\n\nWhere do I even start? I can safely say that I've played my fair share of ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•mes, reaching into experiencing roughly 30+ different games. In the ones where I could make a character specific (Such as Mage, Warrior, etc), I would choose to make the healer. The most sought after, rarely played, and hardest to solo of them all. I also had a few other friends who were playing RO2 alongside myself. Well, over the internet of course.\n\nThe whole time we were playing, it just felt like a tedious run here, do this, run back kind of game. At first, I wanted to give RO2 the benefit of the doubt, but after hitting the 2 hour mark, I could see, and sadly admit to myself, that this game was just not that fun, even with other people!\n\nDuring solo play, I found myself just mashing the 1 key to do my basic "Holy Light" attack, or whatever the skill was called. I barely gained another useful attacking skill for practically the entire time I played.\n\nPlaying with the group however was a more enjoyable experience. At least then, I was able to use my Heal, Revive, and Buff skill.\n\nOne of the cool things this game did have was the Card System. Almost every monster in the game would drop a card. These cards could be equipped; up to five. Certain sets would give you bonuses, and it gave the game a somewhat Pokemon-esque feel.\n\nWhile the quests were generic, there was always a plentiful amount. Story, Side, Dungeon, Monster Hunters, and more. You never needed to worry about needing something to do.\n\nSomething Ragnarok Online 2 does that I absolutely LOATHE is having items, equipment, and mounts that had time-limits. Yep, you read correctly. Time-limits. The worst possible feature a game can have.\n\nOh, and the class change in this game is nowhere near as awesome as the first game. You finish the quest and the person just says: Congrats, you're now a X, whereas in the first one, you had a light beam down on you and your clothes would change.\n\nEventually I just got to a point where I said "I'm done." RO2 eventually becomes more of a chore than a game.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nQuests: As basic as they can get; Split into the trio of: Go Kill X, Talk To X, Gather X.\n\nCharacter Customization: Limited. Pretty much just Hair, Face, and Eyes.\n\nGraphics: While it's a nice touch to have Ragnarok venture into the 3D world, it lacks the detail of the original. From character models to environments to monsters, everything is very, VERY, bland and lackluster. One thing I will give RO2 is that it is quite colorful.\n\nGameplay: Auto-Attack or Mash 1st Skill in HotBar.\n\nMonsters: RO2 definitely took the easy way out with its creatures, having many of the same monster models with varying color schemes.\n\nSound: Nothing really stands out as bad, yet nothing stands out as great.\n\nFun Factor: 4/10\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBright and Colorful settings, A unique card system, and some interesting boss fights just aren't enough to save this overly generic, bland MMO.\n\n~3 out of 10~","November 26, 2013","false","45.1"," 291 of 352 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","291","352","0","1"

I am addicted to this game with nearly 30 characters scattered throughout various accounts and have experienced every single class available in the game. Seen the ups and downs of the game. I've decided to stick by this game for better or worse.\n\nEveryone that has reviewed this game in the past has experienced some unfortunate bugs that have been long since patched. If you haven't given this game a try and are going by the reviews, judge this game for yourself. This review might get a ton of thumbs down but whatever.\n________________________________________________________________\n\nDue to numerous people asking for me to go more in depth with this review, here we go.\n\n---HISTORY---\n\n2 years ago this game was released as Ragnarok Online 2: Legend of the Second, a wonderful & more challenging time. Everything was kind of difficult to do and most of the time people rejected you because of not having a specific amount of health for raid dungeons.\n\nSeptember 12, 2013, they released the Noel class.\n\nDecember 2013, (can't remember the specific date like the previous one) this game was renamed to Ragnarok Online 2: Advent of Valkyrie introducing Master Level. ***[Side Note, master level is pretty much rebirth on RO1 but ONLY your display level is reset back to 1 (51).]*** With master level, the older content became easy to do. Until the ramped up the difficultly on the raid dungeons, still soloable if you have the right gears and junk. That same year, the korean server closed.\n\nOctober 2014, the SEA server merged with us making the game iRO2 (International Ragnarok Online 2) and a sperate server called "Freyja."\n\nJuly 28, 2015, the TW server merging with Freyja.\n\n---UPDATE---\n\nThe last major update was the remake of Forgotten Payon and boosting the level cap to 85 (ML35). In August they will be releasing Jawaii, the honeymoon place from RO1. Awhile back they said that a marriage system would not be added with Jawaii but according to the "Will you marry me?" event on the forums, it might be added. (Ovvvvvver jooooooyed)\n\n---GAMEPLAY---\n\n***People have complained that it just a clone of WoW. I have not played nor will ever play WoW so I do not know about that. There are folks on the forums here on steam saying that the camera and movement is terrible. Everyone will exerience different things according to their machines and their connection to the server.***\n\nThe basic levels, 1-50 are so easy to fly through combat level and professional levels alike. There are EXP events every weekend and sometimes during the weekdays to help players with grinding. Level 51-85 aka ML1-ML35, is just grinding of course you can do the Morroc and Dayr Desert quests to boost for MP this could be the main questline or all of the Daily Quests. This is where the EXP events mentioned before comes into play making grinding so much less painful. The current end game gears is Eddga, the "powerful" gear which was specifically designed for PvP. Most of my friends and myself, have stuck with the previous end game gears Cazar & Himmelmez. Now for the what you can do after reaching the max level, anything that you want to do. PvP in WoE (Guild vs Guild, located in Prontera & Morroc), helping low leveled players, collecting items, taking part in Trivia for prizes, farming for items, gears or pets and so on.\n\nIf this is not in depth enough for you, just say so. With so much experience in this game I just picked key points and just touched on specific topics. I apologize if this is unorganized, this is my thought process.","June 3, 2015","true","747.0"," 164 of 199 people (82%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","82","164","199","10","5"

This only works half the time and there is no way to manually log in. After every update it stops working or sometimes it just stops working for no apparent reason. Second, quests are bugged. I've had a main storyline quest just break with no way to recover it and no other quests available, effectively making the entire character useless. Google revealed that there are several quests in particular that have been broken for years without anyone working on them. Third, the prices for items are different depending if you are on the Warp Portal website or if you're on Steam. The best deals are on their site. Also, some items expire after a couple of days (which is bad if you can't log in half of the time.)\n\nThe game has been doctored so that Warp Portal can make more money. In the original Korean servers, there are quite a few Tiger mounts that you could purchase for in game money. All of these have been removed and put in a cash shop were you have a CHANCE at getting them permamently in a box. (There is only one mount available that does not require real money.) Costumes are not permament either. Most costumes expire after 30 days and you need to buy extenders to keep it. Both these items cost real money. If you want a permament costume the only way to get it is by more chance items, or by getting a lot of rare stones to play a pyramid game (which has an extrememly low chance of getting an item.) Inventory / Bank space is severely limited. Only 'medium' bags are dropped / purchasable which hardly have any slots. You will get these at level 10. If you want actual space, you need to buy bags from the cash shop. RO2 may not be a 'pay to win' but it sure is a 'pay to do anything fun' sort of game. Server population is pretty low. No one seems to be socializing. In fact, all the social interaction I had was a creepy guy hitting on me. So, if you play MMOs in hopes of finding some new buddies to talk too, you won't find them here.\n\nIf you insist on plaything this game, do not do it through Steam. Go to the site itself, or better yet find another company / private server. Warp portal is not doing a good job integrating RO2 with Steam. If the game actually worked as intended I might suggest it for someone looking for a casual game to play with friends (if you don't mind old school rpg grinding) but since Warp portal provides such a terrible service, I suggest trying one of Aeria Games' anime MMOs instead. They have a cash shop too, but they are more fair about what they give you.\n\nOverall RO2 is a HUGE DISSAPOINTMENT and I am not saying this because it is different from the first game. I am saying this because of the bugs, Warp portal's poor choice of business model and all the issues I've been having. I've played a ton of f2p mmos and none have quite been this bad.

Comparisons aside, Ragnarok Online 2 is still one bad game. Stay away from it.\n\nRO2 is ridden with a horrible pay2win system; bugs that never or take hell of a long time to get fixed; unbalanced classes; a ridiculous amount of grinding to earn enough money to catch up with those who can buy from the cash shop; and endgame content that is almost impossible to get through unless you use glitches. The staff regularly release new content and events but leave a lot of the game's problems to the side. If you check their Facebook page, people still complain about bugs and other problems with the game all the time.\n\nThe community is also pretty toxic since there are a lot of immature players who are super competitive about the silliest things, including sitting space in town. The only reason I stayed for as long as I did was because I had an awesome guild and really good friends who still played, so I was able to do endgame dungeons with a decent party. But when a majority of them moved to other MMOs, there was nothing left to do but leave as well.\n\nJust... stay away.","December 16, 2013","false","394.5"," 148 of 194 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","148","194","0","2"

Although the early game aspect is fun and exciting, that facade quickly slips. Despite easy and quick leveling in early game, late game content is still severely lacking, and heavily unbalanced. Constant gamebreaking bugs, pay-to-win events, poor server optimization, lag and latency issues, incredible graphical defects and compatibility issues with regional settings on your computer make the game nigh unplayable at times, especially after big patches.\n\nThe Pay-to-win model breaks balance between free to play players and paying players, and the gap between them is offputting to say the least.\n\nThe biggest problem I have with the game is the ridiculous amount of RNG uses in places where there shouldn't have to be random attribution. Random chances to get an item that once opened up, gives a random chance for an item, and combines with other items with a random chance to get a good item. So many recursive random chances that player advancement is purely luck based, rather than progression based on player activity is unbearable to say the least.\n\nThere are many good things about the game, but honestly, it's hard to talk about them, when the first thing you think of after a long session of raiding dungeons or grinding was: that was pointless.","December 15, 2013","false","244.6"," 152 of 203 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","152","203","0","5"

The visuals are subpar from its contemporaries and its gameplay is seems to be very common with other Korean Online games. The early game bosses doesnt offer that much challenge as the bosses from old RO. Although the inclusion of raids is good, that is also the only place where you can get an actual challenge because this game is too easy.

The most unprofessional game management I have ever seen. The only reason I could see anyone giving this game a shot is for nostalgia's sake and even that isn't worth the headache. There's hardly any semblance to RO1 other than a few mobs/cities. The actual mechanics and gameplay are completely different.\n\nYou might be lulled into the game starting out but once you hit level 50, you get slapped by the AoV update which changed the game from a quest based/storyline progression focused on dungeon raiding to a full grind progression with only daily repeated quests and few true raids. I find the beginning levels to be extremely misleading now, as the game completely switches focus once you hit the level 50 cap. If you make it that far, then you run into the issues in the rest of my review.\n\nThe game constantly suffers from bugs, glitches, and exploits. You can expect every content patch to come with atleast the same amount, if not more, bugs. You can expect these bugs to be fixed in the next 5 months.... maybe. I actually quit, only to come back and see that it STILL suffers from the same issues. WP/Gravity continue to release patches that do nothing but break more aspects of the game. Meanwhile it takes months to get any bugs fixed.\n\nExamples:\nWoe update- invisible bridges for over a month, texture glitches, guild cape fiasco\nPet update- immobilize bosses, gm dna handout, hacked pets lvl 4(near impossible to get)\nAoV update- imbalanced all classes, pvp broken, sp consumption abnormally high still\nSEA Merger- brought over op items, bound items could be unbound stacking with newly obtained items, bound seeds could be sold by rune removing, costumes with unobtainable stats, hacked lvl 4 full pet inventory, guild/char name conflicts glitching people's accounts/chars\nCard refine hack- massive influx in duped/hacked +9 refined cards, some still exist\nThai Merger- broken zeny conversion%, freyja economy destroyed\nJawaii update- storyline quests broken, job change quest broken, quest glitches\n\nI don't think they even play their own game. That or they have no idea what they broke or how to fix it so they throw attempts at a fix at it, and hope something sticks.\n\nIf you like button-mash, endless grind boredom with random periods of glitched/broken/bugged class/skill/environment mechanics, you will like RO2, as that is what it has become sadly.\n\n\n\nTL;DR: If you're looking for a Ragnarok sequel, just wait for Tree of Savior.","December 26, 2013","false","261.4"," 40 of 50 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","40","50","0","4"

There is a cash shop involved in which the game will shove in your face any chance it can get. Despite what my profile says about my play time, I leveled up a character to Master Level 1 outside of Steam, because I couldn't launch it otherwise. The graphics are decent and very cutesy if that is your style. Some environments are colorful and quite eyecatching. Players who enjoyed the original Ragnarok Online will recognize a few NPCs, and then become disappointed at how bland they are. The dialogue is very simplistic in order to match a certain personality type assigned to a character. The translation is rough and you can spot quite a few typos. Quests give plenty of experience, so it is easy to level up a character to 50. However, it is hard to find players to run through dungeons at later levels. It's not uncommon to wait up to an hour to find a tank or a healer. PVP is pretty much P2W and laughably unbalanced. After you hit level 50, you can complete a quest to become a "Master Class." This is where I lost interest in the game completely. The game becomes a pointless grindfest. Every time you die as a Master Class, you lose experience (called master points)... unless you purchase an item from the cash shop to avoid the penalty. Players have been leaving and many servers have been shut down since RO2's inception. The developers have put less effort into keeping players interested and more effort into milking as much money as they can from a F2P game.

The original Ragnarock was a massive success in the day, where the world felt alive, and the gameplay was pretty fun at the same time. The sequel was in the works for a VERY long time, and now that its been released... Its a pathetic game, to say the least. There was a unique feel of how the original Ragnarok played, and the second game is NOT unique in any way. Its a pathetic attempt to cash in on the Ragnarok IP, while not taking any risks, nor keeping any of the charm that the original game had.\n\nIf this game came out 8 years ago, it might have been somewhat ok, but its just sad how low quality the game is by today's standards. Its using an ancient engine with low polygon-count, low-res textures, and is filled with extremely generic gameplay, just click on the enemy and mash ability hotkeys until its dead. It is nearly identical to the hundreds of Korean made free-to-play MMORPGs, with the only thing that sets it apart, is that it uses Ragnarok art assets.\n\nIf I had to sum up the game with one word, it would be "Generic", if I had to use one sentence, it would be, "stereotypical outdated Korean F2P MMORPG that uses Ragnarok art assets"\n\nThe makers of this game should feel ashamed for being so damned lazy. Thanks to them, the Ragnarok name will likely slide into obscurity.","December 30, 2013","false","2.6"," 24 of 31 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","24","31","0","3"

It's really boring to play alone after you've reached master level(based on my experience). Don't get me wrong, I had fun playing this alone, up to a certain point.  The storyline is good IMO, the characters are quite lovable, and the graphics are not that bad either. I suggest you give this game a try.

I want to say "not as good as it should be" but instead I find myself saying "Not good or fun at all." I give a lot of chances especially to something I want to be good, this took 3 mind numbing chances after waiting a while for the bugs to be worked out first. Give it a try of course, but don't expect much at all.\n\nLong Version :\nRunning back and forth between 2 characters over 6 times before killing or collecting an item is downright boring as hell. I have played Ragnarok Online the original and it was/is much better than playing Ragnarok Online 2. The game went 3D and lost all value in community and leveling gain. After multiple times of scrapping and redoing the game it should have been much better than this.\n\nTime should have gone to giving Ragnarok Online 1 a huge update or cloning the game with a different storyline. This was awful and I cant play anymore than the 8 hours I have pushing myself to like it. Sorry Gravity but you value your profits too much for this game to be any good.\n\nAnime cut-scenes were interesting. New card system is not as inspiring. Music loops so much it may have made me nauseous, Running up and down a hill shows obvious bugs that should have been fixed in Korean Beta, none of my costumes fit me (hat was floating 4 feet aboive my ehad at all times) All of the items are timed. Peco usage for 3 days. VIP access was generous but pointless, the people are NOT fun to play/talk with (original has that locked down better than any game)\n\n","February 9, 2014","false","7.4"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","17","21","0","0"

Card System\n\nI actually like this part, I'm a person who loves completing collection and like it even more if those collections have a point to them. Each card has a set of stats on them that boost your character, and you can have up to 5 cards at a time (You unlock up to 5 slots as you level). You can also upgrade the cards to be more powerful, though this is more luck than anything eles. It takes 5 diffrent cards to give it a go, however if you fail you lose ALL those cards, so if you have been farming a monster for hours to get that one card you wanted and you fail upgrading it, well...sorry.\n\nStoring of the cards is also probomatic at best, unless you pay for the card album, your patheticly small bags will overflow with these and other junk you need for quests and crafting. Now paying for the card album itself wouldent be bad except you only get that storage for 30 days at a time, after which you have to pay more real world money to keep it open.\n\n2. Storage: this brings us to one of my pet peeves for any f2p mmo, having to constantly buy storage. You will never have enough space, and they know it. want a 30 slot bag just so you can haul that crap around? better bust open the wallet. Expand your bank a little? Swipe the card sir! In a perfect world, this stuff would be managed with in game currancy, not real world money.\n\n3. Comunity: I know that gold spammers are the bane of any mmo, however they are not even present here, which should be a good thing until you see the chat. Some of the most annoying chatter i have seen. The chat channels are not even regulated. The filter also does more harm than good, bleeping out half of every 4 or so words it 'thinks' are swear words. So while I do not see gold sellers spaming in the game, I know its not moderation, its just they think the game will tank apperently.\n\nThere are a few things that are good in this game, and from time to time i run into people who are willing to help a newbie out instead of just spouting off some insults just because i asked a question. So while I did press 'not recomended' let me just add this....Its worth playing if you have nothing to do, just do not spend any money on it because later on down the road you  will regret it.","December 31, 2013","false","51.4"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

It's quite hard to do the Mastery Quest at 50 if you don't know other players to go farm the gears needed or the Rank up. Back then, the quest was hard, but it wasn't that hard. (During the Beta days). It'll take you at least 3 days to get to 50 then possibly quite a lot of time == if you're just starting out -- to get prepared just for the quest. Once you rank up, the gears that you've farmed from the end game dungeons will be obsolete because the base Master equips are incredibly strong.\n\nIf you really love playing Ragnarok, there's a sense of nostalgia there from the first one. However, if you're expecting the same gaming experience as the first one, you're in for a big disappointment. They took it to the generation of generic mmo's. Still a good time to play, but it's best to play with friends -- or get a guild ASAP.\n\nJust a fair warning, once you get to Master Ranks (50+) the game'll change into a HUGE grind fest so be ready for that.\n\nTL;DR : I'mma give this game a 6/10.

Dropping the player into the midst of an epic battle for control of Middle-earth right from the start, Ragnarok focuses on delivering an individualised single-player experience comparable to that of the Dragon Age series. The player meets his/her love interest, the knight Hans Rapad, early on before he is taken prisoner by an evil sorceror and trapped in an ancient castle ruin. Without spoiling anything, the second act of the game focuses on Hans' rescue, and as an avid Hammerwatch player I know that other fans of that franchise will feel very at home here. As with previous Online 2 games, abilities and combat strength is determined by a vast, inclusive skill tree--think Path of Exile, but without an initial choice of class at the beginning of play. Instead, the main character and all unlockable party members (each available for purchase in-game for $3.99) each start with a simple choice of Focus (Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, Constitution, Speed,  Charisma, Presence, Corruption, Agility, Fertility) and build outward on the skill tree from there. This makes play highly customizable, and gives huge replay value to the game. Combat is similar to that found in the „Åã„Åü„Çè Â∞ëÂ•≥ series, with fast-paced and innovative combos being the bread-and-butter. The unique combo system allows players to create their own combos, offering even more customization and crazy action possibilities. Overall, I would rate this game a 7.76 out of 10; while it offers a lot of options, great gameplay, an amazing story, and awesome replayablity, purchasing additional party members forces the monsters to scale their difficulty, which means one cannot simply pay real money to succeed at the game more easily. I'm looking forward to Nintendo adding that feature in the next Online 2 installment.

This game plays and FEELS exactly like a generic Korean MMORPG: Fetch quests, do them, mash down your hotkeys, right click, loot all, run back to town.\n\nDoing this RIGHT off the bat is a huge turn-off. Would you like to do this for 15-20 hours before you get to your first job advancement at level 25? By then, you'll be able to do dungeon runs and raids. TANK? KEEP AGGRO. DPS? KEEP DAMAGING. HEALER? WATCH THE HP BARS AND SET UP YOUR BINDINGS!\n\nThere is literally nothing else that keeps the user interested. If you're comfortable with the 'Point-and-Clicker' WoW style based game without subscribing, then this is right up your alley. And it's free naturally. Unfortunately, the cash shop is still questionable. I have not even seen what COSMETICS you can get out of it, it only works with a raffle based system and you don't even know what you're getting. 100 of these points equals a dollar. These raffles costs 6 dollars each. I don't even know if it's permanent or if it runs on a 30 day expiration. If it's the latter, that is sad.\n\nThe log-in screen music kicks ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•.... But every other BGM is generic. Animation is a bit cheesy. A bit downgraded from most MMOs I see in 2010+.\n\nThere are people that already 30s and 40s.

You're really left with people who made guides on their blogspots from the Philppines. HEUEHUHEUHEUHEUHEUHEUHE! Because it's really important that a Acolyte's Job Advancement are Priest and Monk. And those TWO are very DIFFERENT classes. One turns to a more robust healer while the other one turns to a DPS and Off-Tank Fighting Machine with his fists.

I just can't. I've spent my fair share of hours playing it and I can tell you: It's as dull as it gets. The idea in itself was not bad, but the execution is plain terrible. It's fun for a while, but after putting some time into it, it gets old pretty fast (and you realize it's not going to get better).\n\nMost of the classes are pretty boring after some levels, with only a few skills to use. All of them feel very generic and uninteresting, unlike RO classes.\n\nYou will also get bored of the quests real quick. It's not just the nonsense they put you through sometimes, they are also BLAND and MONOTONOUS. The kind of BLAND and MONOTONOUS that makes you wonder why are you still playing the game.\n\nAs of summer 2013 it also struck me as a pay2win game, as you could enhance your HP, SP and movement speed by spending money.\n\nIt pains me to say this, but you're better off playing the original Ragnarok Online. I so wanted this game to be at least half as good as Ragnarok Online was.\n\nAll in all, the login screen music is great. That, and the Led Zeppelin reference in one of the towns are the only good points about this game. That, and the characters don't look half bad either.","December 29, 2013","false","118.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NaaliAave/recommended/231060/","NaaliAave","Naali","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NaaliAave/","65 products in account","If you want the fast and skinny (TL;DR): This game is a greedy pay to get ahead WoW clone that will ban you for no reason. Don't play it, especially if you want to remember Ragnarok Online as being good.\n\nThe Analogy: Divorce. She gets half your money, breaks your heart, and did it for no reason other than she heard a rumor through a distant relative's distant acquaintance's 2nd cousin's roomate that you could possibly be cheating (even though you weren't).\n\nThe long Answer:\nWouldn't work through steam for me, but I still managed to play it. Clocked in several hours (despite my hours on record, which consists of me trying to get it to work through steam) made it to level 35 and tried to look past the problems:\n\n1. Clone of every other MMO out there (I know this has been said a million times, but it can't be emphasized enough).  Way to think inside Schr√∂dinger's box after a radioactive element found in said box has decayed leading to a series of events in which the game can accurately be described as the condition of, lets say a cat in that box, after an outside observer has say opened the box.. They took out original classes, so now you have standard sword guy, magic guy, bow guy, healer (and slightly a religious stereotype) guy, and sneaky guy. Also thanks for the crafting system which took less imagination to create than any reality show ending in "wars" (seriously, occupation + wars = new TV series). They scrapped the interesting card system to turn it into a trinket system (Oh cool, +3 strength. Where's my "Immune to magic" or "Can see invisible dudes" or "You can do more damage to this type, but this other type will pwn you"). Type advantages also seems pretty arbitrary, as I've taken out water type enemies with fire moves fairly readily, sure electric does more, but not super substantially so like in the previous game, and some enemies/dungeons are so difficult you HAVE to over level even accounting for all boss mechanics.\n\n2. Buying way too heavily into the whole fee to play thing. CONSTANTLY reminding you that you can buy these things for crafting or reviving yourself or to look pretty. Also 14 day limits on things? That's Microsoft levels of greed. Take down the time limitations, people will still spend lots of money at your shop. Also, the clothing (at the time) was random, so you could potentially spend hundreds of REAL DOLLARS and get absolutely nothing you want. It is absolutely the greediest game I've ever played including cell phone games that ACTUALLY HAVE POPUP ADS EVERY FEW SECONDS PANDERING TO YOU ABOUT GIVING THEM MONEY. Oh and did I mention that the clothing is worth more on the auction house than pretty much anything else? So, they complain about buying gold (which I am not for in the slightest, I hate unbalanced games where you can pay to win, and bots drive me up a wall, you're playing the game to PLAY IT, not let someone else play it for you, then pay them for the work), but then they just indirectly sell you gold, with the potential to ban you anyway (see below). Oh and if you want to talk balance, thanks for having a VIP card that you PAY FOR AGAIN, which gives you a large stat boost, and is basically just a monthly fee. JUST CHARGE THE MONTHLY FEE AND RAISE EVERYONE'S STATS.\n\n3. The graphics are just terrible. With all the other "free to play" MMO's out there being substantially ahead. I would rather pay 10 bucks a month and get a decent graphical upgrade. So many clipping issues, and camera angle issues... ugh. That's all you could come up with? Even after tons of people paid you 12 dollars a month for YEARS (I think RO1 was 12 bucks). I really don't care about graphical quality all that much, but when RO1 looks better to me, and it looks like you changed the skins on some PS1 game, come on.\n\nBut then, even after ignoring all these glaring signs they decided that wasn't enough. They permanently banned me for absolutely no reason. I contacted them and said that if a person who bought gold bought something of mine from the auction house the anti-botting security might have picked that up and banned me. Nope. You banned me, and that was the straw that broke the camel's back. I hope you choke on the money you're extorting out of people for a 14 day mount, which in any other game would be permanent.","January 1, 2014","false","0.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I would finally get to see that fantasy world I had spent so many hours in in full 3D!\n..That's also about it. The graphics are cutesy and really scream RO, and there are a lot of throwbacks to the first game. You will quickly find yourself killing Porings and Chonchons once again, and each of them still have their respective soundeffects I have personally come to dread (in a loving way!)\nOther than that though, RO2 is just your typical MMO. Although there are definitely upgrades from the first game (Actual quests, flight paths, group finder), it doesn't really bring anything new to the table and is pretty much just your average MMO. Yes, you could play any other free MMO to have the same experience, but if you are a Ragnarok lover or dig the graphics/gameplay, go for it!","April 24, 2014","false","47.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Economy based, grind fest with repeatative music from the very get go. While it has a certain charm style-wise (as all Korean mmo's do) it's a pretty distraction at best. It's a cookie cutter mmo....same tired concept of unoriginal questing and there's absolutely nothing inspiring about it. If you enjoy cute things, then go ahead and play....if it was cute and had substance that would be one thing but it's just cute, that's it. Find me a slightly chibi style mmo that doesn't have the same exact play style and quest system and you will have found the unicorn. I don't see how these same style mmo's keep getting made and never managing to be original as they continue on. I've been fooled before by good looking Korean mmo's, Lineage 2, Aion, Rf Online, Terra online, and been disappointed. I guess there's a big enough population of gamers that like these uninspired things.\n","January 27, 2014","false","1.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

For me it was so distracting that I on more than one occasion was scratching my head and had to go back and read the dialogue again.\nsome of the quests are simply find a character, then that starts another quest where you have to talk to that same person again.\nEarly on there is a time where you meet the person then have to talk to them four times, this could have been swayed by just haveing an actual dialogue with the person.\nWhen you meet the king you are given the offer to become an apprentice knight.\nthen it actually says that your character says yes. removing your choice.\n\nIn a medium founded on naritive (JRPG) and a style founded on choice and player empowerment (3D quest based games) this fails at both.\n\nI love the look and feel of the Ragnarok world. (Poorings are just to cute to ignore) but without a solid story to add richness to the world and more consideration given to the NPCs and the PC choices this one is going to likely be forgotten fast.\n\nHowever I am considering reinstalling the original Ragnarok to get my pooring fix in a fun and lite hearted world.

Better with friends, boring alone.\n\nAs a MMO, R√ñ2 is below average, quality-wise. Some might chalk it up by saying it's Free2Play, but I've played better F2P MMOs before; R√ñ2 gives an aftertaste of unfinished game, a Forever Beta whose developpers bit more than they could chew. The character design isn't particularly original, and the voices are standard. The graphics are okay at first, but get rather dull after the tenth hour. However sometimes you will stumble upon a beautiful scenery (and sometimes, stumble through), but it's not often enough to make it acceptable. The gameplay is entirely standard; the good thing is that you won't be lost with the controls, but if you were looking for something original/different: look somewhere else. As for the story, it isn't grandiose, but if you played the first game, you might like some elements of it.\n\nOne big issue in the game, that I hinted at earlier, is how buggy it is, and how little the GM support is. In all the time I played, I managed to contact a GM only once, and managed to get stuck in [trees, houses, mountains, invisible rocks, broken stairs, dunes, out of bound, water, wall, boat, ...] more times than I can count. In one occurence, I got stuck in a mountain; when trying to use a move skill to get out, I warped through the map, fell under it and stayed stuck. When I logged out and back in, I was 3 zones ahead, monsters were 10+ levels above me. Another time, I simply swum my way out of the map, then fell again; same scenario. Although it was hilarious when it was discovered, this kind of bug quickly grew annoying.\n\nThat being said, if you've played R√ñ1 before, and have some friends who did too, you might want to give it a try; despite everything, it's still fun to play it with friends, even if only halfway through.","August 5, 2014","false","121.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

This item is not permanent, and the shop seems to only currently sell it at one week increments.\n\nSecond of all, this game is bound to your steam account, so that means that if you were playing this before the steam version came out, or were unlucky to begin playing on the first day, you can't actually run this game through steam.\n\nThird of all, this game plays like a generic MMO where your main source of experience is fetch quests, so either find x person or gather x items, as this game has level barriers, which means that if you encounter enemies 5 levels above you, it basically means it won't be worth trying to kill them as they will probably one-shot you or you will not deal enough damage to make the experience worth it.\n\nFourth of all, the steam cash shop is actually more expensive than if you were playing through the original game client.  This is because they made it so that steam users are bound through their steam account, so the cash shop transactions go through steam, and I guess steam wanted a cut of the profits or else this game wouldn't have gotten onto steam.\n\nFifth of all, the endgame of this game is only raiding with people.  This might not be a downside to a lot of people, but if you check youtube for any videos of raids in this game, it looks horrific with the horrible camera controls and boring combat.  There actually is zero reason to play this game, as there are better free MMO's out there such as Neverwinter or Path of Exile.\n\nThe final complaint that I have about this game is probably centric to only me, as other people seem to get by fine.

As with many reviews and opinions, take this with a grain of salt and do your own research. It is a shame I have to put up these notes telling people what they should already know on to do their own, but due to inflammatory commentry, I do.\n\n\nI quit the game running ym hands through my hair and slapping mself to help make me feel like I was alive again.  @_x\n\nWow. Didn't think the game would be bad as I heard the first game was spectacular. Wrong. I got a headache from this game due to monotonous crap, horrible camera controls (spent a good 30 minutes fixing it), and the lack of character individuality. My god, there were five characters that looked the same only that the colors were different. On the topic of colors, they were washed out and muted, more like pastels. The color black does not exist nor does any definition in design and contrast. The little Pouring icon at the top of this store page is much better art than in the actualy game. At least cuter in my opinion.\n\nOf the "massive World of Ragnarok" there are only four jobs that the six classes can do. Speaking of gameplay, your inventory gets filled up quickly with no NPCs around to sell to, and you have to buy another pack to make it bigger, but that takes a while. An estimated three hours of playing the game and I never left the local area you start the game in. The chat controls are the worst, spending a good 15 minutes trying to join a public chat from the "normal" or general one I was in and back, especially they don't list the channels you can join and go searchingfor the proper channel name.\n\nSo what's good about this game? For newbs like me who never played the original Ragnarok, this game was horrible. For elites who played the original, this game was horrible and a big letdown. From many I heard from it's severely lacking much from the original. yeah, it's a new game, yeah it's different, but not a good diiferent.The name brought me here after much praise and this game made me walk away with a big headache and three hours wasted, as well as probably most of my brain cells, most likely after being given a mission to "find the mailbox" (which was right behind me) and given a reward, and then "talk to the mailbox" (again given a reward)  when you click to talk to it.\n\nI think this sums up your first three hours of this game: When not hurting cute bouncing things was "accept mission, run to mission, complete mission, accept reward, accept mission, run to mission, complete mission, accept reward, accept mission, run to mission, complete mission, accept reward. Kill Pourings. Accept mission, run to mission, complete mission, accept reward. Kill Pourings."    After three hours....  "Yay level 2" -_- .......  so yeah, I've lost my mind. Game over.\n\nP.S.: You can't complete your mission unless you accept the reward so if your pack is full the mission will not be completed. -_-","July 12, 2013","false","4.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/flyingtaxi/recommended/231060/","flyingtaxi","FlyingTaxi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/flyingtaxi/","86 products in account","Based on my experiences of playing this game for about 20hrs (the Steam timestamps are somewhat screwed up here) I'd like to warn fellow sympathisers of Ragnarok Online who are rushing into its successor with high expectations:\n\nI expected Ragnarok 2 to have something to do with the original Ragnarok Online. I installed the game full of anticipation it would be a Ragnarok Online in 3D ! With a beautiful and diversive world to explore ! With new skills and a better fighting system ! I'll be able to make a completely individual char, a wholly black knight and ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• like that ! This will be awesome !\n\nAfter starting the game I figured that I would be disappointed in even my lowest expectations.\n- The gameplay is a simple WoW copy and utmost boring. Why would you limit the fights to auto-attack rounds in a game like this? Let me fight myself.\n- The "open world" is more of a path you follow - from village to village - doing your repetitive 'kill 20 of these', 'get 10 of those' quests. Always the same type of quests with no emotionally involving content behind. Couldn't they think of anything to evoke the player's passion about playing this game?\n- Using the exact same job class system as in its predecessor I was very surprised to see that Monks now can't use the Acolyte skills they acquired before. I am sure there are similar rip-offs with other job classes. I am not against inventions, improvements and new stuff but there is nothing positive about this.\n- Everything is very colourful and cute but the game fails to surround me with spectacular, astonishing or inspiring environments - Ragnarok Online does that even in 2D.\n- I don't know why but I had difficulties crafting items, using items, buying items, trading items, ... maybe it's just me but it felt very complicated and not as conveniently accessible as it should be.\n- Almost all usable items are timed, which makes you lose interest in getting or using those in the first place.\n- Do you remember the feeling that you got in Payon Dungeon? Orc Dungeon? When entering Prontera? The Geffen fields? The Comodo Beach? You won't get even close here...\n- "Ragnar√∂k" is an event in the old Germanic and Viking mythology. The meaning behind all terrains, quests, names and monsters in Ragnarok Online is a combination of different culture's mythologies (i.e. Munak and Bongun referring to Chinese Jiangshi, you also find Korean, Taiwanese and other references).\nNow in Ragnarok 2 I am told to obtain the crown of the Sunflower King. wtf?\n\nI wished it was a Ragnarok Online turned into 3D graphics, with an active fighting system, some cool character individualizing stuff and maybe even some open world building elements (I'd love to build my own in-game house with my own obedient Kafra servant) but what we got is all annoying stuff about WoW put together in pretentious Anime style, claiming to be the successor of Ragnarok Online. I am sorry but I couldn't think of anything positive to say about this game. I guess the in-game music is not as disturbing as it possibly could've been. A few musical references to its predecessor would have been nice, though.","February 2, 2014","false","0.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/flyingtaxi/recommended/231060/","flyingtaxi","FlyingTaxi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/flyingtaxi/","86 products in account","Based on my experiences of playing this game for about 20hrs (the Steam timestamps are somewhat screwed up here) I'd like to warn fellow sympathisers of Ragnarok Online who are rushing into its successor with high expectations:\n\nI expected Ragnarok 2 to have something to do with the original Ragnarok Online. I installed the game full of anticipation it would be a Ragnarok Online in 3D ! With a beautiful and diversive world to explore ! With new skills and a better fighting system ! I'll be able to make a completely individual char, a wholly black knight and ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• like that ! This will be awesome !\n\nAfter starting the game I figured that I would be disappointed in even my lowest expectations.\n- The gameplay is a simple WoW copy and utmost boring. Why would you limit the fights to auto-attack rounds in a game like this? Let me fight myself.\n- The "open world" is more of a path you follow - from village to village - doing your repetitive 'kill 20 of these', 'get 10 of those' quests. Always the same type of quests with no emotionally involving content behind. Couldn't they think of anything to evoke the player's passion about playing this game?\n- Using the exact same job class system as in its predecessor I was very surprised to see that Monks now can't use the Acolyte skills they acquired before. I am sure there are similar rip-offs with other job classes. I am not against inventions, improvements and new stuff but there is nothing positive about this.\n- Everything is very colourful and cute but the game fails to surround me with spectacular, astonishing or inspiring environments - Ragnarok Online does that even in 2D.\n- I don't know why but I had difficulties crafting items, using items, buying items, trading items, ... maybe it's just me but it felt very complicated and not as conveniently accessible as it should be.\n- Almost all usable items are timed, which makes you lose interest in getting or using those in the first place.\n- Do you remember the feeling that you got in Payon Dungeon? Orc Dungeon? When entering Prontera? The Geffen fields? The Comodo Beach? You won't get even close here...\n- "Ragnar√∂k" is an event in the old Germanic and Viking mythology. The meaning behind all terrains, quests, names and monsters in Ragnarok Online is a combination of different culture's mythologies (i.e. Munak and Bongun referring to Chinese Jiangshi, you also find Korean, Taiwanese and other references).\nNow in Ragnarok 2 I am told to obtain the crown of the Sunflower King. wtf?\n\nI wished it was a Ragnarok Online turned into 3D graphics, with an active fighting system, some cool character individualizing stuff and maybe even some open world building elements (I'd love to build my own in-game house with my own obedient Kafra servant) but what we got is all annoying stuff about WoW put together in pretentious Anime style, claiming to be the successor of Ragnarok Online. I am sorry but I couldn't think of anything positive to say about this game. I guess the in-game music is not as disturbing as it possibly could've been. A few musical references to its predecessor would have been nice, though.","February 2, 2014","false","0.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

RO2 is honostly an empty game. It feels empty because not even the trailer can give you a story to what your fighting for. They love using P2W tactics and take a backseat to players trying to grind the hell out of levels. If your reading this and you want an MMORPG worth it then think like a Miner looking for a job.

They're fun to play and each feels unique without feeling too much like the same classes from other MMOs. In short, it stands out and not just because of its heritage.

And i can honestly say that I really like the graphics/game play of the first one (if the phone one is anything close to the actual first Ragnarok). Ragnarok Online 2 is a game that I personally enjoyed and from the first night of playing it me and my friend got to lvl 10. Now being the huge MMORPG fan that I am and like any MMO, Ragnarok 2 has some faults that any MMO will have. One of the biggest faults of RO2 is the grind between levels and the amount of exp that some quests will give you. In the early levels of RO2 you don't really realize the grind since it's not hard to level up a new character from.. lets say 1-10, then 10-15 and then 15-20. The leveling system is all good until you get to lvl 20 and then try and get to lvl 25 so that u can learn your claases new job (mine being thief going to rogue). With knowing that you can learn a new job soon and get some new moves, you get all pumped and go the hardest you can to lvl quickly. This is where you quickly notice the change in the exp rate and how much exp you need to actually lvl.....This is where the grinding starts to really get annoying.\n\nIf Gravity fixed the leveling system past level 20, it would make the game a whole lot more fun and make it feel less than a chore. Over all I would recommend this game since it has bought me and countless friends that I have already recommended this game to hours of fun! My advice for this game is to make sure that you have a friend with you when you get to lvl 20, so you don't have to get bored out of your mind when trying to lvl!","March 27, 2015","true","60.2"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

Unlike the first Ragnarok the game is far less grindy, however in comparrison to let's say Tera and Guild Wars 2 leveling up still takes quite a long time. While most quests are "kill this" I still find myself enjoying them. There's only one server and the community seems just fine. Just a few days ago I helped someone by giving them potions, they gave me a blue staff and then I teamed up with a group killing a world boss. Having in mind that I'm completely new and this game doesn't have a lot of new comers I did not expect to get into groups at all.\nIf you're unsure whether the game is for you or not, the download is only 5GB, so you might as well try it :)","November 26, 2013","true","34.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

RO2 is more of a 'WoW Clone' instead of being a 'true' sequel in terms of gameplay and structure. That being said, it is not a bad game especially for being completely free. Fans of the original should keep an openmind should they wish to check it out. If you're a fan of standard MMOs then this is not a bad option. Visuals are decent but some spell effects look somewhat lazy, character models are good and the musi is alright but there are some odd quips. Overall 3.5/5, its free so you got nothing to lose in trying it out.","May 14, 2013","true","149.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Not so great if you want to feel you accomplished something. RO1 was the epitome of grind/reward.\n\nI played RO1 from closed beta to at Niflheim, and was in some of the very serious guilds. It's fun to see how the old was integrated, but it's VERY different. The world & monsters are AMAZING, but I get a bit annoyed with all the "run there, talk to XXX" quests. The quests are rarely confusing but most are too easy (laughable vs RO1 quests). Another annoyance is the incredibly low inventory space they give you.\n\nI experienced zero bugs and video performance was outstanding. I was blown away how big they made some of the maps & some of the intricate details. The character/NPC models & movements always make me smile. I'm not exactly sold on the music (still better than Lutie s***), but the SFX are good.","December 13, 2015","true","8.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Here in RO2, it feels like a poorly made clone MMO. Animations cut themselves off or repeat suddenly. Sound effects are insanely annoying due to the sheer amount of enemies that repeat their stupid sound effect over and over again. The UI is entirely made to look cutsy and just cludders up the screen with useless crap. (Yeah, I get they love the poro but give it a rest already!)\n\nThe camera movement starts off stupidly fast for some reason, as if this is some fast pace FPS or Third Person Action game. It's far from needed as you'll just walk to target, smack target and then walk to next target. In short, it doesn't feel right. The game is played without issue on my computer but the actual gameplay is not smooth. It feels janky and unfinished; basically lacking quality polish. Then it bombards you with Cash shop stuff and tries to ease you into all their related items and options. It's content first then ask us to buy your crap, not the other way around.\n\nI'm sure the game has all the End level nonsense as RO1 did or jobs within jobs of jobs but I couldn't be arsed to play the game any longer than I did. It litterally brings nothing interesting or new to the table. It takes from existing games and doesn't take the really good parts from them.\n\nI want to enjoy the combat, I really do but if I wanted to play an extremely slow paced MMO there is still RO1 or a list of many other similar games.\n\nIf you aren't really wanting to play this game then just don't waste your time downloading the game and then having to patch it afterwards as the game obviously doesn't send patches to steam to download. Play something else.","August 1, 2015","false","0.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I've tried a couple but none of them seem to pull me in very far and I get bored and leave in the first couple hours. But this game is one amazing exception. The artstyle and look of the game is beautiful, so colourful and detailed. The voice acting is really good as each character and NPC has a voice rather than just a silent protagonist. Gameplay is as you would imagine it to be with an MMORPG with you levelling up and buying new skills with your points. This game has some nice additions, my favourite being the 'Card' system. When you kill and enemy there is a chance he will drop a card, this card then can be equipped and add special bonus stats to you character. That one thing alone makes me want to go out and fight as many monsters as I can and believe me there are many, all of which looks beautiful and unique. The story is well crafted and I've managed to stay with it with no confusion at all. For a free to play, you should definately get it and play with friends. It get's a lot better when you create a party and devise your strategies together which become incredibly effective.\n10/10","May 25, 2013","true","12.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","2"

Unfortunately, it's a bad MMO in everything else.

If you want a game with no bugs, or P2W, then pay a monthly fee. As you can see I like this game for many reasons, but I will be unbias in my review. Let's prove it by talking about the downfalls:\n\nThe three worse parts about RO2 are the leveling and the [lack of] PvP, and the release of new content. In my thousands of hours of WoW, it is fair to say, that a much better Quest line system from lvl 1 to max level is available in other games. The leveling is very, very grind-till-you-drop style. There are three kinds of Quests: 1. Kill this monster twenty times (some times for an item it drops to give to the quest giving npc) 2. Talk to this npc  3. Gather this item.\n\nPoor planning of Patch release dates that bring new content to the game. There have been three, no wait, four new dungeons in six months added to the game. I have the best gear in the game (^^) but to be honest, a lot of people are either skipping new raid dungeons to go to the newest one, or moving to the most recent raid dungeons half geared from the one before it (my point is a "new" dungeon shouldn't become redundant after a month an a half). They would be better off releasing 4-8 dungeons a year all at once, or six months at a time, and letting players work through them tier by tier.\n\nPvp is entirely under developed, but they did add a new PvP map, which is actually pretty awesome, if you have a DPS cahracter. Healers are not really needed unless they are a hybrid (DPS mixed with Support). There are three maps: 1. Colo (it is a big open circle so not really a map) on this map you free for all with 30 other players for 5 rounds and people are eliminated each round 2. WOE (don't even get me started) this is a poorly designed map with too many choke points and you can only enter with your guild (fyi: I am in a very large, strong guild) and the big, strong guilds always win (my guild is PVE based) 3. Jehoon Training Site (nice map and game play) uses a lane and tower mechanic like DOTA or LoL with merchants to buy buff scrolls and monsters in the "jungle" which you kill for a quest to obtain items and points to win the match or buff your team (also debuffs other team).\n\nPVE: The Good Stuff  : D\n\nThe best PVE content in my opinion is end-game. Like anything there are good and bad sides. Let's get one thing straight, I have done every raid a bunch of times on my own and in a guild, and they are all doable with Pugs (random people) aside from AoD (unless you are over-geared, but for review sake, let's assume you have gear from the tier below the raid you are doing). The bosses in the ten-man raids are all fun. They aren't too hard that you rage out and quit the game, but aren't too easy that you get bored and quit the game. There are two bosses though, that are extremely difficult to most people (Rat Master and Zoda). I did Rat Master with only pugged raids and killed it almost every time, but never the first try (Rat Master: two tries, four tries, nine tries.) in order to enter the Chaos Dungeon (newest raid dungeon). People say it is impossible and cry, and cry, and cry. Put simply, it takes chatting software, strategy, practice, and skill. Not every one is meant to make it to the furthest endgame content in any MMO, and those people, usually have trouble accepting it. For me, PVE is the best part of the game, and reason I have played so much.\n\nInteresting Content: There are a lot of unique aspects of the game that I hadn't seen in others. 1. Costumes: these are either "grind your face off" or P2W items, but overall it is an interesting and "fun" aspect of the game. The amount of power you get from costumes depends on how many Runes you put in it to give you bonus stats. You can also combine costumes with a chance to get "rare" costumes. I have only gotten one "rare" from thirty combines total over a span of months of game play, but lucky people in my guild have gotten "rare" costumes with only one fusion.  2. Cards: cards are only dropped from monsters and bosses. They give you bonus stats, and you can combine them to get rare cards, with great stat bonuses. 3. Phantom Pyramid: this is a P2W mini-game that you play in order to win content. It is based on RNG and can provide great rewards, or waste money (in-game or real life money) and time.\n\nOverall this is a great F2P *once you hit max level*. There are bugs, and the only real issue I have is the lack of attention put towards fixing those bugs faster. If you are a talented PVE player in any ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•me, be prepared to be surrounded by the most idiotic players you have ever seen (mainly Tier 1 raids and early game five man dungeons). You have to find people that are awesome players to raid with from the pugs you do, or join a great guild. There is a decent job system, and class system (with a nicely set up talent tree for each class). And even though I say to myself, "why would the developers do that?" more than I would like to, I ffind myself logging back in to play (way too often).\n\nPS: Thanks for reading my book.","December 18, 2013","true","136.1"," 9 of 21 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","9","21","0","0"

If you don't expect the game to be something it's not (a AAA major mmo with an extensive raiding end game, RO1 in 3D etc) and just enjoy it a fun, casual game it's very enjoyable. The art style is pleasing, smooth with a beautiful color pallette and a very animated feel to it. The classes/stats have a build system that reminds me quite a lot of the original game and the story is even pretty decent, if the translation is very hit or miss.\n\nThe highlights of RO2 are it's non-combat sytems like card collecting and pet building as well as crafting. I'm sure that someone who plays the game for 1000+ hours will find many things wrong but if you're looking for a light hearted escape with some old school mechanics it's well worth a few hours a week.","February 3, 2014","true","71.1"," 7 of 17 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","7","17","0","0"

Bite me ^^\n\nRagnarok online 2 I picked up by accident, clicking it while trying to get rid of an ad, and then downloading it out of curiosity. I am quite pleased I did.\n\nThe game itself is (from my limited experience), reminiscent of the playstyle of early WoW. Focused on the usual core classes and the first person MMO style I very much enjoy. The core classes are pretty varied, with option to diversify into two subsets when you get to a higher level.\n\nAtop the core classes there is a Job system which is while second to your class, has its own leveling system and, through proper use of the job system will allow you to level much quicker. Simply put, you can make your own armor and weapons, make your own potions, or buff yourself even as a fighter before a match, depending on the job you pick.\n\nThe game is Free to play, so I would say it is at least worth a brief look at if nothing else. (As a note, the graphics start of fairly high end, nearly crippling my laptop on my first go. I would advise reducing the render distance to 2-3 to make sure it wont interfere with gameplay).\n\nI would say that the game greatly benefits from having friends to play with, but it can be a fairly enjoyable solo adventure, with a surprisingly interesting story. I expected a simplistic, insulting reason to just go and murder several areas of color swapped creatures. Instead I got a large variety of creatures, many different NPC's and points of view. While not perfect there has been honest effort to make an interesting and involved story in which you participate, including an earlier section whereupon you end up fighting your own repressed memories.\n\nI certainly would rate this worth a try, and possibly to keep.\n\n7.5/10\n","December 1, 2013","true","55.1"," 7 of 17 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","7","17","0","0"

Currently a level 40 Full support priest 2 things I do love about this game is that it's free to play. and most of the cash shop items are tradeable. So when people argue "OH IT'S PAY TO WIN!" well.. Yeah you can spend real money to get a SLIGHT EDGE but you can also buy THE EXACT SAME STUFF with in game cash. So yeah. The fun doesn't really start to happen until levels 15-20ish though.","May 7, 2013","true","0.2"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

Unfortunately it's still in the middle of development and every patch bring a bug and fix the previous one. On the other hand every patch bring a lot of new contents so the game has always something new to do also if you reached the cap lv. If you have patience to all the bugs that this game still has is a nice game (you can see how many hours i played until now). As EVERY free to play has buyable content that give you shortcuts to gain items and cute costumes to wear or mount to travel a bit more fast trought the world. The so hated vip pachage that increase your stats and your drop rate by 5 points it'a a nice thing but don't trust who say that makes this game a Pay to Win. It's a free game download it and try it you will see the items in the shop are not so powerfull, most of them are just costumes, or paints for your costumes. I repeat it's a free to play game but developers need to eat too so it's normal that there is a shop in game where you need to use real cash and where you will find helpfull things. You don't want bugs? You don't want and in game shop? go and play world of warcraft and pay 14 euros every month and don't try to jump a payment.\n\nPS yes there is a lag after the last patch but they recently improved the graphics and they still need to optimize it, they recently introduced a beta tester server and developers will be more focused on EU and USA servers soon AND even more these days is going on an event for new caracters created these weeks.","July 2, 2013","true","453.2"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","1"

The graphics are stunning making you feel immersed in the game. Unqiue NPC's and carefully designed zones are everyone. This game hosts a wonderful community with a bit of the downside also though. Since this was originally a Korean MMO, the text has been translated yet it is very poor one at that which can lead to confusion for the player. Majority of the quests are the same as well us the usual of MMO's, re-using rigs. Ragnarok Online 2 is a point and click game which while seems annoying, it is also very useful too as the 3D graphics provides multiple mobs. One of my personal peeves of RO2 is the abundance of glitches, bugs, and others alike. I am able to experiance more then fifteen different ones a day (playing for maybe 10 hours or so). All in all, this is a wonderful game and absolutely my favorite.","February 23, 2014","true","476.8"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

Simply find people to sell those VIP passes, then go to the auction house (Yes there's an action house. It took me forever to realize that) and pick and choose which costumes you want.

Is it a worthy successor of the original RO?  Some ways: yes, others: no.  The graphic style translated very nicely over to 3D and the game definitely has the Original's feel.\n\nWhat is missing, however, is the level of accesorizing, number of jobs and even number of skills available to classes.  Accesorizing is still there, but limited and difficult to find good accesories that are not limited time items.  They over came some problems the original had and dropped new ones in your lap.\n\nMy #1 gripe remains the 'support' given to the game.  Warp Portal, the service used as launcher and forums/tech support system is unfriendly to use and hard to locate what you need.  If you make an error filling out a form, they don't tell you what is wrong.  When you ask for password recovery, you're still waiting on the promised email hours later.  GMs are still aloof with no way to contact one.\n\nTo thier credit, they did manage to fix the chat issues.\n\nOverall, I say play the game. If you like it, you'll love it.

The graphic style translated very nicely over to 3D and the game definitely has the Original's feel.\n\nWhat is missing, however, is the level of accesorizing, number of jobs and even number of skills available to classes.  Accesorizing is still there, but limited and difficult to find good accesories that are not limited time items.  They over came some problems the original had and dropped new ones in your lap.\n\nMy #1 gripe remains the 'support' given to the game.  Warp Portal, the service used as launcher and forums/tech support system is unfriendly to use and hard to locate what you need.  If you make an error filling out a form, they don't tell you what is wrong.  When you ask for password recovery, you're still waiting on the promised email hours later.  GMs are still aloof with no way to contact one.\n\nTo thier credit, they did manage to fix the chat issues.\n\nOverall, I say play the game. If you like it, you'll love it.  But pray you never get technical difficulties!","May 15, 2013","true","219.2"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","1"

I was a long-time fan and player of Ragnarok Online back when I was in high school, but once WoW came along...well, we all lost a little of ourselves to that behemoth in its good days. Anyway, seeing this old gem get a repolish is nice, and there's lots of references to old RO still in this version. I enjoyed playing it up to a point, and if you can tolerate some of the Freemium stuff floating around (It doesn't effect the gameplay NEARLY as much as some of the other free to play MMO's out there like RotMG) it can be an enjoyable experience.

At first I thought it was just a crappy Korean Cash Shop WoW clone with Ragnarok imagery, but was i quite wrong.  It DOES feature some of these things, but does so with a style and flair that was quite unexpected.  At first you will think otherwise, but after a few hours of leveling and exploration you soon learn that this is a whole other beast.  Quest based leveling without the grind is a nice plus, not to mention the PvP that is alot of fun to participate in.  The cash shop is not a requirement to compete/enjoy the game, but is there for those who want it.  VIP is only 9 bucks a month, and worth every penny as well.  It's enjoyable without putting a penny of real world money into it, and even more fun if you do.  All in all, RO2 is not as cheesy and crappy as it appears, and the endgame content for gear is also pretty fun for what it is.  Give it a shot.  The community is nice, helpful, welcoming, and much like the previous game MAKES this title worth playing for hours on end.","January 7, 2014","true","839.8"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Nothing worse then eliete players with their swords suved so far up their... you know whats.. in a game that you had been playing the game since it was first launched...and be called a "noob:. or even worce...\n\nI was called a d i c k s u c k e r in a dp for i told someone to wait for our tank....\n\nEven in Guildwars 2, Eve online, Star craft 2, Star Trek i had the same issues... no one to help me figgure crafting, perks, or armour... nothing but stuck up and dishounorable people.\n\nThis game has problems, but not in a way that makes you want to stop playing, but are hard to play around.\nFor example, i have, and i mean HAVE to reset my bottons for crafting and armour everytime i click on them to use them.\nAnother, in areas of the first lower level zones i get attacked by non existing enimies..\nThat is a problem....\n\nCards can be a problem, you have a time limmit when it comes up to your card album in whitch i find really anoiying.\n\nInfact, most of the stuff you do get has aa time limmit, it is at times a pay too win but it is free if you don't let it bother you too much.\n\nI have a good computer... iv had one one issue with a lag spike but that is erelevent...\nTheir are progreming flaws, but i am sure they are working on it as we speak..\n\nThe main problems with some enviroments is the suroundings sometimes randomly building as you get closer to them, and i dont mean slightly i mean.. right infront of you sometimes it will sprout a christmas tree 0_0 or a building...\n\nThe voices for the npc's are horrible... and some fit, that is due to budget.. and lazyness... can't complain too much\nI would just take them out if it was my game and just make people read more, but its not my game .. XD\n\nThe music is.... AMAZING!  Some areas have music that is a tad anoiying but it fits the enviroments... Im not sure who made the music but i bow down to your greatness!\n\nThe selects for your new creations if you want to start a new game are limmited, but aren't bad..Eyes, Eye color, hairstyles and faces, colors, voices.. are pretty good!\n\nThe side jobs  are very limmited, Chef, Cook, Alch, and Light arm, Heavyarm. Pretty good.\nAnd the main jobs are also incredibly limmited, Swordsman, Arch, Healer, Mage, and Theif... They do have Another pick besides Humans, but only one other... can't complain too much.\n\nGeneric is the name for it...\n\nThe animations are okay, the idol animations make you look like for in a fastion show.. pretty stuid\n\nBut, all and all.\n\nNot bad at all for a game that is FREE!

At first I thought it was just a crappy Korean Cash Shop WoW clone with Ragnarok imagery, but was i quite wrong.  It DOES feature some of these things, but does so with a style and flair that was quite unexpected.  At first you will think otherwise, but after a few hours of leveling and exploration you soon learn that this is a whole other beast.  Quest based leveling without the grind is a nice plus, not to mention the PvP that is alot of fun to participate in.  The cash shop is not a requirement to compete/enjoy the game, but is there for those who want it.  VIP is only 9 bucks a month, and worth every penny as well.  It's enjoyable without putting a penny of real world money into it, and even more fun if you do.  All in all, RO2 is not as cheesy and crappy as it appears, and the endgame content for gear is also pretty fun for what it is.  Give it a shot.  The community is nice, helpful, welcoming, and much like the previous game MAKES this title worth playing for hours on end.","January 7, 2014","true","839.8"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Nothing worse then eliete players with their swords suved so far up their... you know whats.. in a game that you had been playing the game since it was first launched...and be called a "noob:. or even worce...\n\nI was called a d i c k s u c k e r in a dp for i told someone to wait for our tank....\n\nEven in Guildwars 2, Eve online, Star craft 2, Star Trek i had the same issues... no one to help me figgure crafting, perks, or armour... nothing but stuck up and dishounorable people.\n\nThis game has problems, but not in a way that makes you want to stop playing, but are hard to play around.\nFor example, i have, and i mean HAVE to reset my bottons for crafting and armour everytime i click on them to use them.\nAnother, in areas of the first lower level zones i get attacked by non existing enimies..\nThat is a problem....\n\nCards can be a problem, you have a time limmit when it comes up to your card album in whitch i find really anoiying.\n\nInfact, most of the stuff you do get has aa time limmit, it is at times a pay too win but it is free if you don't let it bother you too much.\n\nI have a good computer... iv had one one issue with a lag spike but that is erelevent...\nTheir are progreming flaws, but i am sure they are working on it as we speak..\n\nThe main problems with some enviroments is the suroundings sometimes randomly building as you get closer to them, and i dont mean slightly i mean.. right infront of you sometimes it will sprout a christmas tree 0_0 or a building...\n\nThe voices for the npc's are horrible... and some fit, that is due to budget.. and lazyness... can't complain too much\nI would just take them out if it was my game and just make people read more, but its not my game .. XD\n\nThe music is.... AMAZING!  Some areas have music that is a tad anoiying but it fits the enviroments... Im not sure who made the music but i bow down to your greatness!\n\nThe selects for your new creations if you want to start a new game are limmited, but aren't bad..Eyes, Eye color, hairstyles and faces, colors, voices.. are pretty good!\n\nThe side jobs  are very limmited, Chef, Cook, Alch, and Light arm, Heavyarm. Pretty good.\nAnd the main jobs are also incredibly limmited, Swordsman, Arch, Healer, Mage, and Theif... They do have Another pick besides Humans, but only one other... can't complain too much.\n\nGeneric is the name for it...\n\nThe animations are okay, the idol animations make you look like for in a fastion show.. pretty stuid\n\nBut, all and all.\n\nNot bad at all for a game that is FREE!

I like how you can be a vendor without sacrificing your ability to choose a class for fighting.\n\nIt's also cool how you can get slots in your bag for free.\nThis is a real F2P.\nPLAY IT. NOW!\n\nNew Edit: I quit due to the fact I was tired of daily questing, since my important quests wouldn't show up after leveling soo much, New Edit #2: But now its fixing up. :O since I need an mmo to play I'm getting back to this and all other mmos ive been trying are utterless crap. This game is really smooth to play which is why I miss it, so if you haven't played World of Warcraft which lures you back in all the time, I reccomend this game.\n\nNew Edit: its pretty fun and dungeons are good. Its balanced IMO and there arent so much skills but not so little. Im playing it again and probably not quitting for a while. My friend finally got to play it again on her new Windows 8. Now that was off-topic, its a pretty great game. I SAID IT SO MUCH.\n\n+Pros:\nFun partying and guilding\nLots of timely rewards like EXP boosters, which make grinding easy.\nProfession Classes!\n\n+Cons:\nGets boring sometimes when grinding\nHard to find parties in a timely manner.\nMORE to come","July 2, 2014","true","58.5"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

I am also a original Ragnarok series fan and let me tell you Ragnarok 2 is no where near the originial Ragnarok But there are the good things and the bad things. So heres my break down.\nSo far ive reached lv 25/25 combat and job proffession so im pretty much halfway the game.\n\n1. Crafting System - 9/10\nThe crafting system is simply great. At the beginning of the game you choose your specific proffesion. for example blacksmiths gather materials from minable rocks around the whole map while artisans carve out leathers from your hunted enemies. this system is really engaging and makes grinding more fun!\n\n2. Gameplay/Mechanics - 7/10\nRather than the old skill point and click Ragnarok 2 lean more towards on modern MMORPG 3rd person view press "tab" to change target. I def. prefer the original series game mechanics. But im not gonna lie there is something interesting with the new system. The new skill mechanic has a combo counter and you use this counter to use stronger skills. A good combo strategic style of gameplay\n\n3. Raiding - 8.5/10\nExtremely difficult almost impossible to solo unless you are 20 levels over the dungeon. nonethless its how you play the game. with parties and cooperative. Raiding in ragnarok 2 is as fun as the original series. no difference from other mmorpg usually played in roles. tank etc etc\n\noverall verdict, ill give it 2 thumbs up and would let everyone to try! its fun and its new forget the old era its suppose to be innovated.","June 24, 2014","true","92.7"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

If you like anime and mmo's then this, by far, has the best anime based graphics available in an mmo.  Personally, I think the content needs to be darker.  It is all well and good to have your happy forest full of goofy creatures, but you need to have your dark forest (or cave, that'd be cool for a zone...) full of zombies and necromancers too.  If it is in the game, then they need to introduce it earlier in the game. (of course it is too late now...).\n\nThis game is good about the whole 'buy power' thing.  Only thing I've noticed is the VIP pass that provides a stat bonus and earns more currency in dungeons (which i assume is used to purchase stronger end-game gear).\n\nAll-in-all, it is a balanced game with a classic mmo playstyle and a unique crafting system.","November 25, 2013","true","29.3"," 6 of 17 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","6","17","0","0"

Best played with a group of people, which is pretty normal, but solo-ing at least up until the first dungeon is viable. You can party with random players at anytime, and as long as you have a good healer, dungeons are possible. Just the right difficulty level to keep you interested with a minimal amount of roaming. First mount comes earlier than you'd expect, and is really nice for traversing the map so you dont get bored early on when you're just farming anyway.","December 8, 2013","true","79.3"," 5 of 15 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","5","15","0","0"

But as it  goes you feel it has nothing new like Ro1 did in its time , its a decent game especially for the ones who played the first one , it will inmerse you back on the feeling of those days but it wont go further if you want to try something new . Anyway it gives you a lot of fun with a fresh and childish humor .","November 29, 2013","true","155.5"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"

This game despite being an MMORPG is actually very good for both hardcore veterans, and casuals. The jobs are very good, and easy to level, and very useful once you join a guild, ect.","November 27, 2013","true","199.2"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"

Ok, i downloaded and i dont know but i created an Account while downloading on their website. Now i launched the Game and it tells me to create an account before i could start the patcher, anyway i own 2 accounts now xD Patched, started, Character Selection.... TERRIBLE PERFORMANCE, the Creation runs with 5 fps or something, and i dont know why, because the game itself runs very smooth (most times) and i can run much more resourcehungry games. The Game features a autorouting for quest, so you can play it brainafk... i played till level 10 and noticed at lv 5 already that it is just a generic MMO and now go play Ro1 !","April 20, 2014","false","0.1"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"

I myself wasted around 100‚Ç¨ (yeah I am that stupid) with useless lottery systems and the try to get more money to use.\nSecond thing is that there are still a ton of bugs, it seems like it was programmed with no love at all, the most serious bugs got fixed (Dungeonfinder and some graphic-elements) but there is still a long way to go.\n\n\nAll in all I recommend this game for every fan of Ragnarok Online to try it out at least.\nLeveling is relatively quick and you do not really have to spend any money until you reach higher levels.","December 7, 2013","true","143.8"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"

Most cards just give +x to str/dex/etc, and its not fun at all, when you have 300+ str and find a card that gives +8 str, yay.... no... There are some interesting cards but they are rare from high level bosses.\n\nAlso stats on lvl up doesn't seem very impactfull because later on you start getting gears with a lot more stats than you get in all 50 lvls.\n\nI don't have much play time but other than cards system i really enjoy this game. Leveling is easy and reaching lvl50 solo is fast and only then the real game starts. When you quest for master level 1 and equip new master gears you feel so OP compared to what you were at lvl50. But once you enter master lvl zones.. ouch :D\n\nQuesting always gives nice EXP and is faster lvling that way than just grinding. Something about questing that just keeps me doing quest then the next one and the next one.\n\nOverall it is fun game and as big Ro1 fan i can say that they did good job remaking Ro2.\n\nOh, if you loved monk in Ro1, you will hate it in Ro2. Monks here are tanks as a heard.","December 18, 2014","true","82.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Everybody looks the same (because the best gear right now is the one from the quests). It does a rather poor job of explaining itself. Especially in an MMORPG you want players to understand all the features, not just some information about every feature. If you like RO 1 or WoW, I guess you're gonna like this as well. If you don't (like me), keep your hands off this time sink. After 3h I still feel like I have achieved a whole bunch of nothing.\nAside from stuttering in the crowded areas and lags everywhere, there is nothing to complain regarding the technical standpoint of the game. I don't get why such low poly models and low res textures cause it to stutter so much.\nThe graphic style is lovely, and the jump to 2D really helps the experience. But while being lovely, it's nothing extraordinary.\n\nI appreciate what they did with RO, but unfortunately it's still not for me.","May 4, 2013","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The first thing you would notice is that  the combat system is totally new as compared the older ragnarok game. The new combat system is now similar to most of the MMORPG games wherein you press buttons to cast skills and to attack. Also, you will notice that you can no longer rely on pure attack speed alone. Unlike in the previous ragnarok, where archers and assasins have builds that has a very fast ASPD, this new game heavily relies on your skills. Another thing you would notice would be the mobs. There are new mobs in here but some mobs from the previous game is still in play. Also, the new game employs a dungeon system that is not in the previous game. So basically, you will feel that you are playing a VERY different game from the ragnarok you already know.\n\nFor those who didn't played the old ragnarok, this is an game with excellent graphics as well as sound. They have quests that help the new players in understanding the gameplay. But it isn't too boring as to render old MMORPG players dozing off while playing the initial, or introductory, stages of the game. They also provide various items for new players such as free mounts, costumes, potions, etc. So overall, its a game that can compete as the best MMORPG","December 12, 2014","true","27.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Most cards just give +x to str/dex/etc, and its not fun at all, when you have 300+ str and find a card that gives +8 str, yay.... no... There are some interesting cards but they are rare from high level bosses.\n\nAlso stats on lvl up doesn't seem very impactfull because later on you start getting gears with a lot more stats than you get in all 50 lvls.\n\nI don't have much play time but other than cards system i really enjoy this game. Leveling is easy and reaching lvl50 solo is fast and only then the real game starts. When you quest for master level 1 and equip new master gears you feel so OP compared to what you were at lvl50. But once you enter master lvl zones.. ouch :D\n\nQuesting always gives nice EXP and is faster lvling that way than just grinding. Something about questing that just keeps me doing quest then the next one and the next one.\n\nOverall it is fun game and as big Ro1 fan i can say that they did good job remaking Ro2.\n\nOh, if you loved monk in Ro1, you will hate it in Ro2.

Everybody looks the same (because the best gear right now is the one from the quests). It does a rather poor job of explaining itself. Especially in an MMORPG you want players to understand all the features, not just some information about every feature. If you like RO 1 or WoW, I guess you're gonna like this as well. If you don't (like me), keep your hands off this time sink. After 3h I still feel like I have achieved a whole bunch of nothing.\nAside from stuttering in the crowded areas and lags everywhere, there is nothing to complain regarding the technical standpoint of the game. I don't get why such low poly models and low res textures cause it to stutter so much.\nThe graphic style is lovely, and the jump to 2D really helps the experience. But while being lovely, it's nothing extraordinary.\n\nI appreciate what they did with RO, but unfortunately it's still not for me.","May 4, 2013","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

RO2 has adopted a generic WoW-style interface and play style that aren't made up for by other features. Customization is limited to pasty beanpole types. The combat and questlines are bland and uninventive. The auction house and party finding systems are poorly designed. The music is nothing special, but there's a player-made patch to replace it with bgms from other Ragnarok titles. The good is that the monsters are the same cute critters from RO that we know and love, and there are plenty of classes to choose from. This game isn't awful, but it needs a lot of work before it can be called a quality MMO.","May 27, 2013","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The first thing you would notice is that  the combat system is totally new as compared the older ragnarok game. The new combat system is now similar to most of the MMORPG games wherein you press buttons to cast skills and to attack. Also, you will notice that you can no longer rely on pure attack speed alone. Unlike in the previous ragnarok, where archers and assasins have builds that has a very fast ASPD, this new game heavily relies on your skills. Another thing you would notice would be the mobs. There are new mobs in here but some mobs from the previous game is still in play. Also, the new game employs a dungeon system that is not in the previous game. So basically, you will feel that you are playing a VERY different game from the ragnarok you already know.\n\nFor those who didn't played the old ragnarok, this is an game with excellent graphics as well as sound. They have quests that help the new players in understanding the gameplay. But it isn't too boring as to render old MMORPG players dozing off while playing the initial, or introductory, stages of the game. They also provide various items for new players such as free mounts, costumes, potions, etc. So overall, its a game that can compete as the best MMORPG","December 12, 2014","true","27.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

After so many hardships,  so many searches and so many troubles.  I have finally played the game long enough to Review.  (If you are wondering yes, my time is only 0.8 minutes,  playing the game but I will give a explanation)\n\nI will say this, it is not as bad as people say it is.  By far it is a average game with a nice story telling.  It has the Ragnarok Feel, to the world,  though of coarse it is nothing like Ragnarok 1.    You level up normally like most MMO do,  with grinds and dungeons.  The quests are of coarse straight forward Talk, Kill and Collect,   Combat is standard with a little movement based.\n\nThis is just my oppinion but it not a bad game,  If you already a veteran MMO player it probably something you would like to Play,  if you are new MMO Player, its a nice starter choice.  I recommend you to atleast give it a try.\n\nBut you might question why I do Not Recommend it.  The thing is,  I have tried Playing this game on my Laptop,  which is a WIndows 8.1,  I have tried playing the game on my sister's laptop a Windows 8.1,  I tried it on my Gaming House Computer which is 8.1,    It just does not want to work Properly I have talked to support, they do not help.  I have done many things from firewall, to protects to administrations and so forth.  It will not work.  So i tried it on my parents PC,  Windows 7  Acer,  can't even play Runescape with Medium Graphics and it Works.  I used my Windows Vista that gives my games a Frame rate of 15-20.  IT WORKS.\n\nSo my conclusion is, that  the game is not accessable to Windows 8.1.  I have looked into boards and many  Windows 8 users have trouble with the game.  Talking about SpeedHacks when their is none.  This has been happening for about 2 years.   Their has been a few,  very few people,  who actaully get into the game with out problems.\n\nIf you have a Window 7 or lower.  Feel free to try.  If you don't you could be lucky,  but if you don't want to waste time.  Don't try.","March 7, 2015","false","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

RO2 has adopted a generic WoW-style interface and play style that aren't made up for by other features. Customization is limited to pasty beanpole types. The combat and questlines are bland and uninventive. The auction house and party finding systems are poorly designed. The music is nothing special, but there's a player-made patch to replace it with bgms from other Ragnarok titles. The good is that the monsters are the same cute critters from RO that we know and love, and there are plenty of classes to choose from. This game isn't awful, but it needs a lot of work before it can be called a quality MMO.","May 27, 2013","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I can't even get past the registration. To simply quote someone who has gotten through.\n\n"This kind of game has its own sub category besides WoW clone. I call it, sweat shop Korean MMO. It's when a Korean company pushes out a low budget, graphically outdated, copy pasta game that wouldn't have impressed anyone after 2002. The controls are just terrible. The choppy camera movement alone makes it seem like the game is running at half the speed that it actually does. The quests are cheesy and overly done. There's no depth in the combat either. Like most bad MMOs, it's just pressing buttons to activate skills in a certain order. There's literally nothing about this game that makes it worth playing."","May 2, 2013","false","0.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Standard free to play/buy premium items for real money setup, but thankfully not very "pay to win".\nIf you want a cutesy styled MMO to ocassionally throw time into, go ahead. If you want to seriously play it or get to the later levels, don't bother. It just gets frustrating and boring. Not to mention the bugs. My favorite are the animation bugs though, because they're actually hilarious. Like suddenly becoming 2D if you jump on a gate, or sliding around instead of doing the running animation.","February 13, 2015","false","16.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
