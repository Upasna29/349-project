If you’ve played LucasArts adventures in the 90’s, you are in familiar territory (and also, lucky). Same if you played 90’s Sierra titles (except you weren’t so lucky). Indeed, you’ll find again every emblematic ingredient: look/use/talk/walk commands, inventory management, branching dialogs, humour…\n\nThe story begins with our two heroes, Ben and Dan (who happen to be digital incarnations of the game designers) coming home from a jungle expedition, just in time for watching Magnum P.I. on the TV. Unfortunately, the aerial is broken and you must help our heroes fix it. It very soon happens that Ben and Dan get abducted by aliens in the process. They (and you) must therefore navigate through alternative dimensions if you want to go back home.\n\n\nThere are three areas in which Ben There, Dan That! shine. The first is its humour. It is plentiful and very funny. It touches on many topics and doesn’t avoid controversy (positive discrimination of handicapped workers gets laughed at, for instance). It’s neither politically correct nor polite. Ben and Dan are not above “♥♥♥♥♥” and “♥♥♥♥♥♥” jokes. So it may not be to everyone’s taste. Most of the humour, however, consists of meta-jokes, aimed at adventure game mechanisms themselves. Those are equally funny, although by the end of the game, that theme will have overstayed its welcome. It also means you probably won’t enjoy the game that much if you’re not an adventure game veteran.\n\nThe second remarkable feature is the puzzles themselves. Despite the completely bonkers story, the puzzles remain logical and avoid frustration for the player, without feeling childish like the recent horde of “casual” adventure games. I didn’t need a walkthrough in order to beat this adventure and I never stayed stuck for long. Despite the relative easiness, my intelligence never felt insulted. It was therefore the perfect balance for me.\n\nPolish is the last award-deserving area. In other adventure games, when you are bumping against a particularly devious (or illogical) puzzle, it is common to start trying everything, using every inventory item on every element in the room. Here, because the puzzles are not very difficult, it is rarely necessary to do so. But I encourage you to adopt that behaviour nonetheless. Because almost all combinations, stupid or smart, have been thought of by the developers and there is almost always a funny line of dialog to reward any desperate action. It’s really remarkable, as other games too often punish you with something bland, along the lines of “I can’t do that” whenever you try something original/stupid.\n\nThere are weaker aspects to the game though. The story is unimpressive. And despite their individual qualities, the environments (or “rooms”) lack coherence. The game universe feels disjointed and the “parallel dimensions” premise doesn't really excuse that.\n\nI'm not a big fan of the technical aspects either. The art style is primitive and something of an acquired taste. The backgrounds are made to look goofy but mostly they are bordering on the ugly. I got used to it in the end, but it means I didn't get a very good first impression. The animations are very basic, and frankly idiotic. I know some will defend them, but to me it looked stupid without looking funny. The best that can be said about the music is that it is unobtrusive. It must also be said that there is no voice acting, but that can hardly be held against the game.\n\nIf you can live with the graphics, and if you've played enough adventure games to appreciate the meta-humour, then by all means, I recommend you purchase the game. It's funny and it's designed with care and attention to details. It's enough to pleasantly fill the better part of a lazy Sunday afternoon.","November 26, 2013","true","9.7"," 86 of 103 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","86","103","0","6"

If this is among your first point and click adventures, you won't understand or appreciate this game.  Play a few others first.  At the very least, play the Monkey Island series first.\n\nThese two games contain two types of humor: absurd, potty humor and jokes that poke fun at point and click game design and the thought process of players.  Some of my favorite moments in the game happen when Ben and Dan bicker about picking up random objects or trying to combine two very different inventory items.  Ben and Dan frequently break character to talk about the merits and downfalls of the genre.  They are aware that they are living in an adventure game world.  I view these games as commentary on point and clicks first and a ridiculous tale about time travel, aliens, and Hitler second.  The art style feels intentional rather than amateur.  One of my favorite aspects of adventure games is the wide variety of art styles, so the graphics here don't bother me at all.\n\nThat said, I think that the first game (Ben There, Dan That) is slightly stronger because its jokes don't stoop to the same level of disgustingness as its sequel.  Some of the sequel's jokes nearly cross the line and seem to exist for the shock value.  I appreciate the humor more when it's better integrated with the point and click meta commentary.  There are also a few puzzles which, while funny, aren't very intuitive.  Especially in the sequel, you'll be asking yourself "What's my overall goal again...?"\n\nI'd rate both games 4/5.  I enjoyed them because I enjoy point and clicks.  And when I play other adventure games in the future, I have no doubt that Ben and Dan will be in my mind cracking jokes about the silly inventory items I try to combine out of desperation.","May 9, 2015","true","9.1"," 27 of 35 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","27","35","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Futurato/recommended/37400/","Futurato","Futura&!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Futurato/","610 products in account","Ben and Dan are a pair of seasoned point-and-click adventurers who also happen to be your average British smartasses – though their jokes tend to be noticeably dumber (in a good way) and dirtier (again, in a good way). While trying to fix their TV in time for a relaxing episode of Magnum, P.I. they set off a chain of events which leads to the universe-hopping and time-jumping plots of Ben There, Dan That! and its sequel, Time Gentlemen, Please! The places and times they visit get sillier and sillier, but who really needs a deep plot when you've got good jokes?\n\nHeavily influenced by classic point-and-click adventure games, both of the Ben and Dan games take their sense of humor and game feel from those old titles. Every line is a bad joke, an embarrassing pun, or an eye-rolling bit of meta-humor, and it's all a blast to read. The writing hits that perfect tone of "smart in the dumbest way" and keeps the energy high with line after line of funny, stupid goodness. It's hard not to be impressed with the writers when the necessary evil of attempted item combinations yields lines that are just as funny as the main dialogue. There must be thousands of lines across both of these games, and I can't think of even one that I didn't enjoy. The art style works into this, too, with a rough look that is nevertheless very charming, colorful, and quite cohesive across every level.\n\nOf course, while old adventure games were remembered for their writing and aesthetics, their gameplay isn't remembered quite so fondly. Unfortunately, Ben and Dan sometimes dive headfirst into those nasty pitfalls. For every few puzzles that goes along smoothly and logically, there will be a puzzle that will absolutely stump you, leading to far too much time mucking about in an overflowing inventory or with the finicky interface. The later puzzles of both games tend to throw logic out the window and require solutions that, while amusing once you know about them, are basically impossible to find without a walkthrough. Still, despite taking the bad with the good of the classic adventure genre, I'd say that the good is easily good enough to outweigh some awkwardness in design. Worthy new entries into a near-forgotten genre.","December 2, 2013","true","5.3"," 26 of 35 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","26","35","0","0"

While rigging up a makeshift television antenna, our heroes transported to an alien ship, to different eras and to different dimensions. As they try to solve their way back to their own home and return to a much needed television break. (Alice in Wonderland type traveling)\n\nGameplay is like standard point and clicks. You interact with objects, sometimes bring them along or use them on other objects or NPCs. There are puzzles but not too difficult to solve which jokes and riddles. Some may be a bit tough, but in hindsight it's "why didn't i see that or get that joke". The story is easy to follow and easy to pick up.\n\nThese games are filled with humor and quick quips about the events around them. Dan Marshall and Ben Ward do a marvelous job integrating humor into their game. The game may not be for everyone but for people who like jokes and like point and click adventures, this game is worth buying and worth your time trying. It's light on your wallet and can give you a few laugh in the few hours you play through this game.\n\nOnly issue may be if you don't really get the humor that can be off-putting. Some humor may be seen more mature. But simply you will recognize in time, it is a lot Dan and Ben taking shots at the environment, npcs, and each other.\n\nDefinite must play.

The humour (though more adult) will likely have you not only laughing out loud (genuinely) as it lovingly takes the p**s out of itself and the games it's inspired by. The puzzles are just off the wall enough to be interesting but not massively frustrating. Although the graphics aren't 'great' (well, not fancy, anyway) they fit the games perfectly. I really have not played a game as funny and enjoyable as this in quite a long time.\n\nMy only quibble about them would be that they're too short - but that's only because I wanted more. Even at full price, there's plenty of value for money here for the playtime.\n\nIn summary, buy this. BUY IT. Why are you still reading this? BUY THIS GAME.

You cannot undo this in any way, so you must sit and wait and scroll... a lot.  And if you click one extra time while scrolling (at the last click), then you must go through the process again.  Virtually everything you examine has a multi-phase text dialogue you must click through in this fashion.  So much time wasted.  There is also a right-click-fest required to go from "eye" to "hand" and back (buttons would be better).

Like many other games of this genre, the puzzles aren’t particularly hard but they are ridiculously arbitrary; more so in this game than in others. As a result, some players may have a hard time figuring out how to solve a problem because it’s not very obvious. The story is extremely over the top, one plot example is the main characters traveling to a different timeline to stop Hitler and his dinosaur army. The art appears to be very experimental, but does have a sense of style to it. That can be bad or good depending on what you consider art to be. The humor is very British and adult so unlike Sam & Max I can’t recommend this to children’s. Overall a good title to buy if you are hardcore in to the Adventure genre, for everyone else steer clear as you will likely not play this game beyond the intro menu.","August 16, 2012","false","5.7"," 16 of 29 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","16","29","0","0"

These games were obviously crafted by people who have experienced the history of point and click adventures, as there are a lot of tongue-in-cheek jokes relating to this genre.  While the games were humorous and I had fun, neither of these games are particularly revolutionary and the backtracking can get repetitive.  In addition, they're obviously low budget affairs compared to other point and click adventure games on Steam.  If you can pick these games up for cheap when they're on sale I say go for it, otherwise there are better options for the price.

It's crude (in many senses of the word), definitely. It's locked into a tiny resolution, puzzlingly. It's paying homage to its roots, certainly. It's poking fun at pop culture and specific events, absolutely. It's short, unfortunately.\n\nIf you can get past the presentation and all its warts, and you have a bit of a warped sense of humour, you'll probably find more than a fair share of chuckles (or at least smiles) within this game.\n\nI do stress that it is s a love letter to classic adventure games, right down to the occasionally frustrating puzzles. Know the genre, and know this game. If you don't like point and clickers, and all that they stand for, you'd best pass.\n\n-----\n\nTime Gentlemen, Please! is what would happen if LucasArts made an adventure game adaptation of a Bill and Ted movie written and directed by Edgar Wright. What more needs to be said?\n\nMore than BTDT, Time Gentlemen, Please! is a proper, fleshed-out game. It looks better, is polished, has a stronger narrative, is funnier, and... well, it's better. Not that BTDT is bad, but TGP is great.\n\nI do think that the puzzles can be a bit...

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/talgaby/recommended/37400/","talgaby","talgaby","http://steamcommunity.com/id/talgaby/","334 products in account","Ben There, Dan That and Time Gentlemen, Please! are two typical indie point & click adventure games that try to bring back the atmosphere of the old wacky LucasArts titles with a large dose of British humour. And it’s not just a gut feeling: the games are full of references and easter eggs about titles such as Sam & Max, Full Throttle, Day of the Tentacle and all other loved classics.\n\nThe first game was originally released as a freeware, and like most of the freeware adventure games, it’s more of a showcase of the writing and game design capabilities of the two creators, not a full game. Still, the story works in its own completely absurd way, the places you visit are designed well, and the puzzles are sometimes hard, but not too difficult. And it’s one of the few adventure games where item usage does not equal the main protagonist robbing every person blind, the items come from very logical sources. (Well, mostly.)\n\nThe sequel was made as a commercial game and the developers really wanted to give as much as they got. And the problem is that they gave too much. The story takes a very drastic turn in Time Gentlemen, Please, and in the end it becomes too convoluted even for the writers. The puzzles start as quite challenging and I the end they reach almost impossible levels. In the meanwhile the trademark absurd humour start to fade slowly to give room to the increasingly complex plot.\nBut the game has saving graces, and mostly in the main ideas behind the different time periods, where the developers constructed the most far-fetched, zaniest alternative timelines you can see outside of Doctor Who. And all of those are featured in Day of the Tentacle-like four-dimensional puzzles of course.\n\nTo sum it up, these games – particularly the first one – are excellent for those who love British humour and still hold a special place in their hearts for the LucasArts adventure library. And if you like a good challenge in brain-twisting puzzles, then all the better.\nBut if you don’t like games where some puzzles remind you of Gabriel Knight 3, or absurd humour is not your cup of tea (or pint of ale), then you will find very little enjoyment in these two.","July 29, 2014","true","8.2"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

But a quick google search for the missing manual and a quick flip, you are good to go. It would have been better if they included the instructions in game but considering it's age...well.\n\nDespite it's shortcomings, not working with steam overlay, weird resolutions and such, it is worth it for the sake of reading those dialogue (try interacting with everything!).

How does it hold out?\nStory- Ben and Dan are two programmers (both real people who put themselves in their own games) who must go on an epic quest in order to catch reruns of Magnum P.I. On the way, they are kidnapped by aliens bent on world domination and so Our intrepid heroes must travel through the very fabric of space and reality in a race against time to save the world and catch old 80's sicoms. In the sequel, a week has past since the end of the world so Dan and Ben now find themselves traveling through time to fix everything (making things worse actually) and try to stop Hittler and his unstoppable robo-dino army from ruling the world. As you can see, the story is as rediculous as can be but then again, it is a commedy. The humor of the game and its story may not be for everyone but any fan of Monty Python-style humor will get a kick out of this game. C+\nGraphics- The graphics have a rather charming appeal that grows on you, and what I mean by that is that it looks like the microsoft paint doodle of a 15 year old kid when he is board. The animation of the characters are almost non-exsistent. But the enviroments are varied and do draw you in wanting to know what you will see next. Like I said, it does grow on you. D+\nSound- There is vertually no sound effects in the game and music is sparse but what music there is is quite fun to listen to and reminicient of the old 8-bit days. C\nGameplay- The game follows a simple P.O.C. format and you can interact with nearly anything with anything for humorous effect. It does kinda get annoying when you have to scroll your mouse through a number of command points (look, talk, touch, etc.) and if you accidentally past the command you want, you have to scroll through everything again so it would have been nice for a reverse scroll to be available. The challege of the game itself is actually very fair, as in not too easy (via Telltale) and not too hard (via Lucas Arts), and is quite fun to explore the different resposes to different actions and very rewarding even if you don't get it right.B+\nOverall- This game is obviously not for everyone. But it is an absolute blast to play and one of the funniest games to play. Highly recommended. C","January 18, 2014","true","3.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

They are also quite amusing for what they are, so I definitely recommend them for the target audience.\n\nThe only downside is one that is shared by many such games, in that many of the puzzles make zero sense, requiring either a great deal of random guessing or the use of a guide to get through the games. Yet, at least in these games, the randomness fits. The entire storyline is so absurd to begin with that it's actually all to be expected in this case. Regardless, the real appeal here is the British humor, the adult level of the story, and the crazy storyline. It being a point and click game is really just a means to an end in order to convey all of that to the player.

Hats off to those of you which find the solutions easily, but I found that difficult to the point of zero fun. If you absolutely LOVED sam and max original, this game is likely for you.

The humor is funny enough, but you need to click for the most basic things like walking across a room way too much to change the cursor, access Inventory and such. Maybe modern times made me lazy, but I recall that I didn't like this control scheme on the old Sierra games back in the day either which is why I barely finished any of them. I have the same issue with these games and not finishing them either. A verb menu or context-sensitive cursors would've helped alot here. On the upside, these kind of controls allow for some funny additional dialogue and obscure attempts that are absent in most modern games.\n\nIf you can look past the controls (I can't), you will find a strange and funny game that you might enjoy - and it's plenty 'o cheap to buy too!","July 25, 2011","true","0.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

You like old Lucasarts adventure games, right?  Monkey Island, Grim Fandango , Sam and Max, stuff like that?  Of course you do, because you have a soul.  And a heart.  And a nerve.  And that being the case, I would highly recommend that you drop a Lincoln on two of the best games ever to pay tribute to those classics of a better time, a time when cleverness was rewarded, when you could experiment as much as you wanted without worrying about death at every turn.  These two games are loving tributes to all those favorites in Lucasarts' back catalog, and they have an unmistakable cheeky British influence that gives them a little extra flavor.  The love is apparent in the attention to detail.... every combination of items, correct or not, has its own bit of funny dialogue programmed in.  If you've enjoyed any of Telltale's recent episodic games or are just hankering for a very good pointy-clicky adventure, you won't go wrong with Ben There Dan That and Time Gentlemen, Please.","December 20, 2010","true","8.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Seriously.\n\nIt's a pretty simple point and click puzzle adventure game. Okay, cool. But what really lets it shine is the humor.\nIt has tons of jokes, puns, Sci-Fi references (along with other references too!), dinosaurs, Nazi dinosaurs, Britishness, etc.\n\nBen There, Dan That is the first game, and I found it shorter than the sequel. I think it took me somewhere between an hour to three hours to beat the first time? I can't really remember. I'm almost done with the second (Time Gentlemen, Please!), and I have over six hours in that one.\n\nAs I play the game I can't help but examine, talk to, and otherwise interact with everything on the screen. The creators really don't hold back the punches here; the characters will comment about almost everything! The puzzles are very creative and I always get a rush of satisfaction (and usually a laugh) when I figure them out.\n\nSo in a nutshell, it's a fun and hilarious point and click puzzle adventure game that is well worth the price.\n\nNow I have to run off and figure out how to beat Hitler and save the world.","May 17, 2014","true","8.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/testify3/recommended/37400/","testify3","Mirin Dajo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/testify3/","297 products in account","Ben There, Dan That\n\nA fun, quirky, goofy point and click romp throughout alternate dimensions. First, the gameplay: your controls are the usual point-and-click fare, no surprises. You have an inventory of objects you find along the way that you use to accomplish specific goals- and almost any of these objects can interact with one another, either to make something useful, or to get a remark from Dan about how stupid the combination you just tried is. There's trees and subtrees and subsubtrees of interactive dialogue with characters you meet along the way. You may also interect with literally everything in your environment, too. Basically if you can see it, the developers wrote an action for it.\n\nStyle is very cartoony, but fun. Don't be looking for top-end graphics here, it's quite choppy! I personally feel like this just adds to the silly, goofy feel. Character design is pretty standard for Dan and Ben, but some other characters you meet are pretty funky looking.\n\nThe game constantly makes one-liners or jokes. It's very tongue-in-cheek, and they break the 4th wall all the time. I promise some of these things will literally have you laughing out loud at least once. Funny dialogue, funny situations, funny level designs... the whole game is one giant cheesy gag and it's fantastic.\n\nThe one con Ihave to say against this game is it's length. It was over far too quickly and left me wanting more. Luckily there is...\n\nTime, Gentlemen, Please!\n\nA continuation of the first game with even more exploration, interactivity, and fleshed out story arc. Much longer than BTDT, too. Everything good about the first game is in here too, but better. Some of the puzzles are *really* hard in this game, miles beyond anything in  the first. They also added a time element that involves crisscrossing timelines and seeing alternate versions of people and places.\n\nTwo thumbs up. Buy it. For an even sweeter deal, get it on sale.

The humor was outstanding with lots of references to P&C classics, the game doesn't take itself seriously at all and doesn't hesitate to break the 4th wall, which is a good thing in my opinion. Gameplay-wise it's very Lucasartsy, no verbs or anything but you cycle through actions and click. There is a rudimentary inventory and you can combine objects.\n\nAfter playing through the game though it's clear that it was meant more as an homage and a parody than an actual game. The puzzles are very easy and while the art has a unique identity, the music and sound FX can certainly be improved. Voice overs would have been welcome but the game plays fine without them.\n\nAll in all a very solid B+ and a must for any P&C veteran","May 25, 2014","true","3.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

IMO are unappreciated gems.\n\nWhile these games are kinda short, they have enough novel concepts and interesting events to keep the player entertained; there was almost never a dull moment.\n\nThe humour in these games is absolutely fantastic, and there were so many times when I found myself laughing out loud while playing.\n\nStoryline:\nYou Play as Ben and Dan, two british best friends and roommates, who embark on an epic quest to create a makeshift TV antenna so they can watch their favourite show, Magnum, P. I. and you follow their adventures which somehow lead them to alien encounters, time travel and more.\n\nGameplay:\nYou switch between playing as Ben or Dan at a time, each having unique actions that the other doesn't, and throughout both games you will find yourself enjoying the hilarious dialogue sequences between the two, and the conversations they have with the other characters in the game.\n\nLike most games of the genre, these games have an inventory system, and puzzles that require the use of certain items that you pick up on your adventures and their combinations, but the puzzles are most of the time hilarious and intuitive, not the frustrating kind that requires a  ridiculous amount of guess work.\n\nGraphics:\nThe games' graphics are in 2D, but they feature a unique and pleasant art style that I found quite nice and a refreshing change from the usual murky graphics in modern games, and while the first game's visuals are considered outdated by today's standards, the second games' are definitely an improvement.\n\nOverall, these games were a tremendous amount of fun, I have thoroughly enjoyed both of them, and at their price (often on sale for $0.5, yes that's 50 cents) they are certainly worth a try.\n\nI fully recommend them to anyone looking for some relaxing fun that doesn't require a huge time investment.","February 14, 2014","true","9.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Both games are less than a pack of gum, so maybe others will have the will to carry on where I got bored.\n\nStory wasn't interesting enough to keep going. "It's wacky Sam & Max inspired nuttiness!" But it's too on the nose and the characters talk too much and I didn't think the dialogue was that interesting or funny.

The depth of them and the similarity I felt to a game type I almost forgot surprised me, and left me wanting to come back to play every time off I took a time off. Hell, I got bored with other games after having another taste of a real quest game!\n\nBoth games have a unique atmoshpere, which makes me feel how some good old adventure games I still remember made me feel.\nThe dialogue is very funny, the puzzles are sophisticated, and solving them gives the same old satisfaction of a complex riddle being cracked.\nReminds me of my favorite quests, such as Monkey Island and Day of the Tentacle, and competes with them easily and fairly.\n\nSome scenes are so tough, they leave you wandering for a while, trying to 'get' what the solution is, sometimes even what the puzzle is!\nThese games are hard in a good way, in which using the brain in a different way (or a hind guide) is a must.\n\nThis game is a modern rebirth of the classic quest genre. Recommended for everyone, specifically for those who know they like quests already, but also for those who don't - and will find out about it soon.","February 15, 2014","true","11.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It smoothly and consistently breaks the 4th wall, and does not sacrifice humor to vulgarity, but uses it to enchance the humor instead. There is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ "Racism" slider in the options. How could you say no to that?!\n\nThis game does something amazingly right that I've never seen any other adventure game do - it continues to be funny and interesting even when you're stuck. There is dialog for almost every object and item interaction; the normally annoying job of trying to use every object with every other object is actually RECOMMENDED in this game. It really is no exaggeration when I say it has literally 10x more dialog than even the most verbose adventure games.\n\nDo start with Ben There, Dan That! though. It is simple and short (~2 hrs), and you'll quickly see the humor this series employs.\n\n4 out of 5 foxes.","August 6, 2011","true","26.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

So there's that.\n\nTime Gentlemen, Please is the sort of point-and-click adventure throwback that gives you a bunch of ridiculous items and asks you to find practical uses for them. Unlike a lot of the classics I thought the solutions to puzzles were genuinely clear and the few times I got stuck I felt like it was my own fault for not trying something obvious.  There are enough puzzles that need you to find out a specific way to use an item rather that just using it in the right spot so it doesn't feel like a case of just using everything on eveything else until you stumble on the solution. On the whole it's on the easier side as far as these games go.\n\nThe writing in the game is more the star of the game than anything else. It's a pleasant change of pace if you get sick of adventure games that simply repeat "I can't do that" for everything that isn't solution related.  Attempting to combine most items or use them with most things in the world will give you unique dialogues for each action. Often with little hints towards solutions hidden in them. The humor alternates between referencing classic adventure games and toilet humor. At first it's pretty funny to examine random items and get rewarded with ♥♥♥♥-jokes, but it wears a little thin by the end and if you're new to adventure games all the references will probably fly over your head. It's definitely has an intended audience that will find it hilarious and the rest will probably scratch their heads. Overall I thought the jokes and one-liners were funny way more often than not, just by the sheer volume of them it's a little tiring by the end.\n\nAlso I'm not a fan of having to click through the different look/talk/use/move options, I'd rather be able to select the one I want, but it's not horrible by adventure game standards, just frustrating after a while.\n\nBen There, Dan That is also included in the package. It was a freebie game that was the blueprint for Time Gentlemen, Please. It's much shorter, but it still has the same mechanics and clever writing. The puzzles are pretty one-dimensional though though.","January 31, 2014","true","10.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The first, "Ben There, Dan That" is not great, suffering from a lot of linearity, but it was still fun enough to play through, and definitely worth playing as a preface to "Time Gentlemen, Please". This one had more polished writing, better puzzles, and felt more open than the predecessor. After the opening stages of the game, there are a lot of paths of exploration and puzzles available to be solved. I did get stuck a few times, but on all but one of them I was able to figure out the solution after taking a break from the game. One puzzle I did have to look up a walkthrough for, but it was only because what I thought was one game-object was actually two, and I needed to click on the "second" one.\n\nOn the whole these were fun for me to play through, with many good puzzles and few bad ones.\n\nTwo things that may impact your enjoyment of the game. The humour is quite crude. If that's not your bag, then I think you'll find the writing grating.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tarma_steam/recommended/37400/","tarma_steam","tarma","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tarma_steam/","106 products in account","Tedious.  BTDT and TGP have been sitting in my games list since the 2012 summer sale and I finally looked at them and though "I should really play at least one so I didn't waste the money."  Unfortunately now I feel like all I've accomplished was to throw a few hours of time after that money.  I've only played BTDT and as another negative review stated that it is the better of the two, I'll pass on TGP.  I quite liked the artwork in BTDT, and that's the only good thing I can think to say about it.  Beyond the artwork, there is nothing to take hold of.  You are in charge of two characters, whose differences seem to boil down to:\n\n- one is a slob and one is tidy (the only time this comes up is when you view their bedrooms, which is about 30 seconds of gametime, and leads to nothing)\n- one has slightly darker hair than the other\n- one wears an outfit referencing one popular 80s movie franchise, the other wears an outfit referencing a different popular 80s movie franchise\n\nI played the entire game and I still can't tell you which was Ben and which was Dan.  The characters, as demonstrated above, give you nothing to grab hold of.  In fact, other than "because two people made it and they bot hwanted to be in it", there seems no reason to even have two characters.  One tags along making comments about tagging along, and does nothing the main character couldn't have done himself.  The 'banter' was overflowing with references and fourth-wall breaking comments, none of which were actually funny and seemed more like they'd just been put there to fill up a word quota.  Quite honestly, it reminded me of my time spent managing others in the food service industry - guiding a couple of interchangeable slackers with a 12 year old's sense of humor, whose only driving motivation in life is to get home and watch TV, through tedious task after tedious task in mindnumbing detail.  Only at least in the food service industry I was getting paid to do it.\n\nThe story was no better.  If you're interested in the game, stop now if you don't want to know the ending, but quite honestly... it's not going to spoil a thing for you to know what happens.  One starts out needing to repair the tv antenna so they can watch 80s TV.  Hardly motivating, but surely it will pick up?  Not exactly.  They are kidnapped by aliens and spend a lot of time getting back only to find the aliens are themselves and have set them up for world domination.  The story ends with Ben and Dan being world leaders.  That's it.  If you think I've lied and spoiled everything, you're wrong - this isn't stuff you find out as the game progresses.  No, the entire game is spent with the aliens making vague references about "the plan" and the last 2 minutes of the game is a cut scene where the story is told entirely in the age-old method of "tell, don't show".  The rest of the game is just the failed humor and "combine things until something works."\n\nOther complaints:\n\n- there appears to be no option to mute (at least turning down sound effects did nothing for me, and that's the only option given), and the music is midi-like and *really* repetitive.\n- the 'following' one would frequently stand in front of what I needed to click, meaning a few attempts at clicking only to get another variation on stop trying to pick him up/I don't want to touch him/whatever dialogue\n- there was a very weird problem with the 'cow' door where clicking on it would lead to a tedious scene where both characters would walk all the way to the opposite end of the hallway and then back again before entering.  There is no way to speed up the characters' walking speeds or 'skip' walking scenes.  Which means if you miss a few items in the previous rooms, you're going to be spending a lot of time watching that hallway go by in both directions.","April 19, 2015","false","0.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.\n5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.\n6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

The sketchy artstyle matches the humor: gross, awkward, unpredictable. One moment you're digging through dinosaur boogers, the next you're collecting samples from Hitler's toilet. Your reaction to those two examples will probably give you a good sense of whether you will find the jokes appealing.\n\nWhat's underneath the crudity is a lovingly rendered, shockingly well-executed pastiche of the best LucasArts adventures. The comedic timing in these games was carefully studied at the foot of Monkey Island, and the inventory puzzles call back to the most infuriating moments of Day of the Tentacle. The puzzles in both games can be extremely challenging, but none of the solutions go into cat-mustache territory -- every puzzle makes sense within the world's twisted logic, and most seem obvious in retrospect once you tease out the solution. The size of your inventory helps push you towards reasoning out solutions instead of trying everything on everything else (though the volume of funny responses will maybe push you to do that anyway.) Finishing each game gives you that deep feeling of smug satisfaction, which is really the highest recommendation for a point & click.\n\nAlso, these games are probably way underpriced because each would have individually stood as a full-price, 6+ hour adventure game back in the 90s and you get both for one low, low price.","February 16, 2014","true","9.8"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

If you aren't into British humor, it is probably going to be painful to read through the game dialog. But if you like Benny Hill / Monty Python type humor, they are bearable. Although separate games, they really should be treated and played as one single long adventure since Time Gentlemen, Please! is an immediate sequel to the much shorter Ben There, Dan That! Combined, these two games hold overwhelming entertainment value for their wild and crazy adventures, completed by truly bizarre and humorous inventory item uses. In comparison Ben There, Dan That! is simply a prototype for the much more refined Time Gentlemen, Please!, but together they complete a highly enjoyable adventure game.

While Ben There, Dan That betrays its orgins as a free tribute to adventure games in its sometimes uneven puzzle pacing, it manages to overcome those origins through the often hilarious banter and its attention to fine detail. My ongoing recommendation in both of these games is to click on everything with everything multiple times.\n\nTime Gentlemen, Please! in contrast is one of the most refreshing and inovative adventure games to come out in recent years, not only is it massively polished but its puzzles manage to simultaneously pay homage to the great adventure games of the past and to genuinely surprise.\n\nCompared to the often overly ornate, plodding, and cumbersome modern adventures of Daedalic and King Art, these games are a breeze and a joy to play.","November 26, 2013","true","0.2"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

Because of this, they look like ♥♥♥♥ but they have a very interesting art style (almost hand drawn). The point and click nature of the gameplay means that they are heavy on the story while being light on the gameplay. The story is not bad as it deals with time travel, aliens, hitler, dinosaurs, and other weird ♥♥♥♥. It has its moments and got a few chuckles out of me but nothing that I was bursting out laughing about.\n\nThe puzzles are very "use this thing from two rooms ago with this other thing from three rooms ago in a weird way that you wouldn't have gotten normally and makes no sense in the context of the game." They often involve strange combinations with a specific thread of logic to the point where I just ended up using a walkthrough. I say that with no shame either because the solutions are the most contrived things ever. Plus, the amount of backtracking will leave you just pizzed the ♥♥♥♥ off.\n\nOverall, its OK. The puzzles drag down the story which was creative but fell a little flat. If you like old adventure games, go ahead.
