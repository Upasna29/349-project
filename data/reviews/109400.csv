I would play this game 24/7, and never get bored of it. It had no lag, great artstyle, and everyone was evenly matched. Ever since the game updated, it went straight down the drain, and now it's a Pay-2-Win game. I think that if this game had no overpowering DLC, even characters, and even weapons, then it would be a much more enjoyable game. If you could unlock every weapon and character with in-game money, that would also help, by giving everyone more variety, and an even chance to play. Some weapons and characters that are Payed For, are stronger than others, and that's not fair nor fun. If this is a Free-To-Play game, then don't make it a Pay-2-Win.\n\nNote: If these changes were made, the companies Rock-Hippo and NQ-Games would be making a lot more money, gain a lot more populatarity, and overall, have a happy community.\n\nOverall Rating | Should I Play This Game?\nYes: 15%\nNo: 85%","December 27, 2015","false","66.0"," 118 of 129 people (91%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","91","118","129","6","5"

Most of the time if you want something cool like a weapon, you're gonna have to pay for it in some way, and hell if you want to buy it with the in-game system of currency then you're out of luck because a lot of it's temporary (which...I admit is good because it means that people aren't over powered 24/7, unless they're willing to pay for it, which 90% of the time they are).\n\nUnfortunately a lot of the core elements to MicroVolts have purchasables embedded in them that limit your ability to fully customize and create your own character and loadout (if your wanting to stick to the "Free" model).\n\nIt's a fun game, I admit, I often return back once in a while and get a couple of good matches in because the gameplay can be very enetertaining. That being said there are many other good free to play shooters out there on steam which I'd recomend over this one because they don't heavily rely on the purchase model, if you want my honest advice get the game Hawken and you will see that it is possible to have a great Free to Play game where you feel obliged to pay for stuff rather than obligated to.\n\nMADE FOR: Fans of Anime who are looking for a decent shooter to kill time.\n\nNOT MADE FOR: Player's who've had experience with other (better) F2P games.\n\nMICRO VOLTS SURGE\n6.5/10","December 30, 2014","false","17.3"," 51 of 68 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","51","68","3","0"

Then they received an update for 'Surge'. Once this update went live, it set in motion their in-game shop.  Once you start playing you start to notice that everything thing can one shot you, which is never fun and causes raging. Instead of fixing the problem they exploited it. Did you want to have better guns then the enemy? Simply $10 will get you that one gun you always wanted. It doesn't stop there, no! Since virtually everything can one shot you in this game you start craving to get better weapons and armor. Meaning more money you spend. This game has turned into a Pay-2-Play game, which is disheartening.  Another problem is that the hacker prevention system that comes with the launcher, doesn't work. There are so many hackers in this game is stupid crazy.

The fact that all official tournaments outright BAN two incredibly problematic paid weapons states more than anything I could say in words. They KNOW it's a problem and they're not doing anything about it. On top of that, almost every all-weapon Team Deathmatch is simply won by whoever has the better explosives spam, which more often than not means "whichever team has more Hermes and Zeus users." Compile that onto what's probably the whiniest paid user base ("You can't nerf 'God Weapons' because I paid $200 for one"), incredibly poor balance (explosives spam & aforementioned 'God Weapons'), and infuriating design decisions (The Sherlock. That is all.) and you get a Quake-style shooter that is only fun if you're playing with friends, which means it will get stale rather quickly, especially since trying to find a good map is like trying to search for a diamond ring in a pit of quicksand.\n\nOn the flip side, this game probably has, visually, the best melee weapons of all time, though you'll never see them because all everyone ever uses is four weapons that are visually unappealing (two of which are bulky swords with ugly particle effects.), boring, and only see use because they are one-hit kill weapons, which is a shame because your other choices include a fork & sausage, a slappy hand toy, a pink lollipop, and a cocktail umbrella. This alone symbolizes the massive waste of pontential that is Microvolts. They had the potential for a quirky-Quakey shooter and instead opted to squeeze as much money out of it as possible while having massive balance issues that take years to resolve, if at all. This game isn't awful, it's mostly just disappointment. I liked it at some point, but now it's just a shell of it's former sel- BR? BR? BR? BR? BR? BR? BR? BR?\n\nEDIT: After the more recent updates to this game, I can certainly say my opinion has changed. I now hate this game with more passion than I had ever defended it with. I hope RockHippo and NQ Games go bankrupt. It appears they are going to soon. They just lost a massive chunk of their playerbase thanks to their removal of Daily Rewards and thanks to their shortsighted money grab - sorry, I mean "God Weapons That Can't Ever Be Nerfed Because By God I Spent $7000 On It",  trying to get new players will be incredibly difficult and making things easier for new players will cause their "loyal" players to ragequit. I have uninstalled Microvolts and implore any prospective players to play Team Fortress 2 instead. I now, with nary the shadow of a doubt, believe TF2 to be entirely superior in any way.","August 3, 2014","false","119.6"," 36 of 49 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","36","49","0","2"

I like shooters.  I like the art style, this could be fun.\n\nDO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME.\n\nOnce you get it installed you'll see it comes with a 3rd party "security" suite.  I assume to keep cheaters out.  I never got that far.  The entire time you're trying to do anything the program will keep freezing up to the point Windows will regularly ask if you want to wait or kill the program.\n\nThe first thing you're asked to do after logging in to something other than Steam is select a character.

Awesome.\n\nI thought I'd give it a shot anyway and selected a free character.  I get a tutorial loading screen and am presented with a map and interface but can't actually do anything.  A couple seconds later I'm presented with a connection failed message.  The only option is to click ok.  Repeat for however long you feel.  Didn't even get to try the tutorial.

The pay to win is strong here; the best weapons (and kawaiiest clothes) can only be bought with actual dosh, the biggest offender being the one-shot kill sniper rifle at any range or body part hit. ♥♥♥♥ that. That said, unlike most other F2P-P2W games, you are able to "permanently" purchase stuff rather than leasing it for a week or so. Thats cool. Also you can upgrade them, so perhaps with enough time your "free" weapons could outperform bought ones. Maybe.\n\nGameplay is kinda slow but still quite frantic, the vast arsenal you have at hand lets you play in many different ways and certain ammo types are restricted in amount so you cannot simply spam rockets or whatever.

In the start, all of the Cons listed above existed. The most notable differences that I've seen are the Playerbase and the P2W of MicroVolts. Over the time that MicroVolts has been out, many-many-many cheats and hacks have been released and continually swarm the game. Speed hacks, instant captures, auto-aim, infinite HP, one shot, free money...they've all been there.\n\nFor months, the company behind MicroVolts released nothing to fend off these hacks. The result? An overly defensive community and a reinforced focus on P2W...or H2W. Fremium players relying on MP are a lot better off now...mainly because they can now take part in the stat-based war. When I first started playing, fremium players were forced to grind heavily and play with the utmost skill in order to earn better items so that they could compete against RT players with unfair stats.\n\nAnd now, as I return to MicroVolts, all of these issues remain. And they have all appeared to worsen. You may enjoy the fast gameplay as you take down opponents...but save your wallets and enjoy something much more palettable and better coded!\n\n~ Recommendations ~\n- Loadout\n","April 20, 2014","false","83.4"," 42 of 63 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","42","63","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pengutheking/recommended/109400/","pengutheking","✾Cinna✾","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pengutheking/","59 products in account","Microvolts is a toy-themed, TPS MMO with terrible servers and people who use all of their money to buy OP in-game weapons. Needless to say, the game isn't all bad; however, there are several reasons why you should play and shouldn't.\n\nGAMEPLAY 7/10\n\nI honestly really liked Microvolts - it was unique, cute, and fun to play. However, the servers really messed up that experience, as you can get kicked out twenty seconds before the match ends - or kicked out at any time, for that matter. It also has many bugs, which a lot of people abuse (ex: glitching outside of map to kill people and not take DMG).\n\nAs all F2P games have, Microvolts has a cash shop with OP CS weapons and outfits to help those who have the money for the game, whereas ACTUAL F2P players get crushed - with or without skills.\n\nAside all of the bad things about the game, MV is actually pretty unique (and similar to TF2). You have 7 weapons you can use on one character, which are the melee, rifle, shotgun, sniper rifle, gatling (heavy), bazooka (rocket), and grenade launcher. Not only that, but with the melee weapon, you can do so much more with these weapons. Such as, using it to fire faster, dodging while shooting, switching weapons faster, and etc.\n\nMicrovolts has a unique way of giving users a way to differentiate themselves from one another. They give you several characters (that are gender-locked), and a massive amount of accessories you can buy to customize them (some of which are only available by real money). Note, the charcters don't give you any advantage over anybody else (except for the outfits, which have stats), and they don't affect the way you maneuver around the map.\n\nEach accessory or article of clothing has a stat, such as extra health or bullets for a certain weapon. This gives users to customize how they want their weapons/whatevertheywantittobe. However, the only downside is, that the CS weapons and outfits/faces give better stats, giving people who play for free the disadvantage.\n\nGRAPHICS 7.5/10\n\nThe graphics are smooth in high settings; however, a cruddy computer can cause you to lag a lot. There are a lot of players from different countries, so your connection sometimes depends on where the hosts live.\n\n(A/N:I enjoyed the toy-theme MV has going on, it's actually one of my favorite things about the game).\n\nAUDIO 5/10\n\nThe soundtrack is mediocre, with the same happy-go-lucky tunes playing repeatedly. It does go well with the game's theme, though.\n\nOVERALL 6.5/10\n\nMicrovolts isn't bad, not at all. However, with their cruddy servers and P2W store, you can only really enjoy it if you have the money for it. This does not mean you can't play and win just using in-game money, though. I played MV without paying a single penny and still managed to get #1 in some matches. (A/N: Zombie mode is my favorite).\n\nNOTES\n\nIf you do want to play this game, I suggest timing when you buy new weapons/outfits, as there is a time-limit on them, unless you get them permanently.\n\nPROS\n\n+ Cute theme\n+ Unique customizing system\n+ Unique gameplay\n+ Melee gives users to expand on the other 6 weapons\n+ Good amount of modes/maps to choose from\n+ Good amount of characters to choose from\n\nCONS\n\n- Boots you off of the game frequently\n- Bugs are abused by users, and can sometimes get you stuck\n- P2W\n- Can be very laggy\n- Some hosts AFK ._.\n\n(You can say I'm NEUTRAL about this game. I don't recommend it, but then again, I do).","June 1, 2014","true","99.9"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","15","21","0","0"

I recently went back to this, and was glad that they added an Assist Point feature in the game now, so now players are rewarded with Assists if they caused damage to the enemy, but another teammate makes the kill. The customization, has improved slightly, as now players can choose either "Bullet" or "Explosive" resistances when choosing parts. The game's cartoonishly violent feel is always enjoyable, with tons of weapons that compliments how you want to play.\n\nHOWEVER, I said it's enjoyable when you play with friends and the right kind of people, because this game has one of the worst online communities I have ever seen. Apparently you are the spawn of Satan himself if you happen to shoot an unsuspecting enemy player in the back, use the Minigun at all (even just holding it out), and you can be kicked for the stupidest f***ing reasons that I have seen players give out. Every now and then, you'll also cross paths with players who feel the need to use unnessecary hacks, such as aim bot, speed, rapid fire auto-shotgun (whatever the hell you call it), Infinite health, etc, that I really hope the Administrators fix soon.\n\nHonestly, I am torn at whether I should reccommend this game or not. The Community, like I said, is absolute s***, probably as bad as Heroes of Newarth and League of Legends (Shots fired), but the game itself is really damn fun when playing with your friends. It's such a shame to see such a fun game just get destroyed by how the various players act.","January 22, 2014","true","69.8"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

That's all I have to say.","June 6, 2015","true","20.3"," 13 of 22 people (59%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","59","13","22","3","0"

Now there are 5 new characters which is awesome. There are more RT items then MP items. You can only get RT with real life currency and MP which is in game currency which you get by playing matches.\n\nI enjoy playing this game a bit to much but I will admit I havent been playing as much as I used to.

The shooting is actually satisfying in this game, especially the Rocket Launcher and the Shotgun, but every weapon feels good in it's own right.\n\nBe warned, as the game is filled with some pretty bad maps that encourage sniper nests and spawn-camping.  The best maps I've found are the smaller maps, with the exception of the truck level.\n\nAlso of note, it took me nearly 24 hours game-time to earn enough points to keep a permanent outfit on my character.  That's WITH the Steam starter pack items which boosts your MP intake considerably.\n\nThe chief thing that people are afraid of when they hear about this game is pay-to-win.

Micro volts. My friend that I ran to whenever I was sad, which I would then rage to because it is a pay to win. In all seriousness though I played this game back when it was at it's core roots. Back when there was only a few guns that were overpowered if you payed for them. I haven't played it in a long time and steam may say I haven't played it for that long but I played on the launcher from the official website. I have logged many hours into this game and I am sad to say it was amazing. It had such potential and it grabbed that potential and it knew what to do. Then they added microtransactions and  then microvolts turned into a p2w. It's a sad story really I would reccomend this game and I feel bad not reccomending it. If the developers want to get rid of over half of it's population just from adding pay to win features then they deserved what they got. Farewell my dear friend....

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/blackcrowbar/recommended/109400/","blackcrowbar","Medic Kimino","http://steamcommunity.com/id/blackcrowbar/","65 products in account","Long Review, I'll probably put a tl;dr at the end.\n\nHonestly, I didn't want to put either I recommend or don't recommend. I'm kind of neutral towards recommending this game to anyone. Basically, try it out yourself, see if you like it, that's that and besides, it's free. I only put recommend because I feel as though there are too many negative reviews. Which is understandable. Everyone giving negative reviews are saying that this game turned pay2win. Which again, understandable because there are a ♥♥♥♥ ton of microtransactions in this game. There's your basic in-game shop with, "PAID WEAPONS ARE UPGRADED VERSIONS OF IN-GAME MONEY WEAPONS!" Then the capsule shop which is basically way to waste all of your money because you're basically opening up crates or cases like in TF2 or CS:GO. There's your standard, "WHAT'S IN THE BOX?" waste of money microtransaction. And lastly, the coupon shop. Coupons are racked up from capsules at random and then once you've gathered enough coupons, you can buy some of the best weapons in the game, which would mean pay2win, right? That would be the case. However, I've seen people run around with in-game money bought weapons and still dominate the match. Granted they did upgrade those weapons to its maximum potential. I've also seen people with paid weapons get demolished by said people. I will say that there is a certain amount of skill that can break through that "pay2win" barrier. But who has the time for that?\n\nNow as you can see, currently I have 145 hours wasted onto this game. Why the ♥♥♥♥ did I do that? While I do indeed think that this game is absolute garbage, I also enjoy it... A LOT. It's a casual game for me to play after I'm done raging over my friends and teammates in League or CS:GO or any other "competitive" games that I play. It's like why people play CoD (I mean I hate CoD with a burning passion but I understand why people like it) It's a nice casual time waster. The skill ceiling isn't too high, you can find matches rather quickly, can leave any time and if you have friends, an all around good time. Same goes for this game.\n\nFurthermore, something that I do appreciate in this game is the usage of your arsenal. You must take advantage of every single weapons that you are given. Being versatile and always swapping weapons mid fight will give you that upper hand in that fight. The is a set fire rate for each weapon; however, they can be increased by swapping to another weapon and back. Think of it as CS 1.6 with the awp or reloading mechanic. People would double tap Q to end the reload animation faster and be able to shoot again at a faster time. Utilizing your double jump is also important. A nice mechanic that is in this game is that you can only double jump when you have your melee out, but be careful because there's virtually no strafing once that first jump goes out. You're locked in that direction if you decide to jump a second time.\n\nHowever, there is a slight issue with other players in this game. Most of them seem to be of Spanish speaking descent (I don't speak Spanish so you can see how this is an issue for ME, if you do speak Spanish, then GREAT! It won't be an issue.)  and their pings are always over 100. I've met a few people with under 100 but it's quite rare to see. I have a constant 20 ping and it can be frustrating at times to dying to the same lagging person over and over and over again. Just be mindful of that fact if you decide to play this game.\n\nFurthermore, hackers exist in this game. I used to play this along with the people in the review sections who are saying, "I remember when this game was good, now it's just pay2win." (Basically 3 years ago) There were a lot more hackers then than there are now. I run into them here and there. There would be some days in which I wouldn't run into them at all. And other days maybe 2 or 3. So on average... 1. Which isn't all that bad. I mean, every games have their fair share of hackers... granted  this game is dying. FML man, why do I play this. There are also kick protection items that everyone can receive from daily missions; you can't buy those in the store. I personally think that these items are stupid. Who the hell thought of a kick protection. WHAT?! H-HELLO?! WHY?\n\nFinal thoughts:\nDid I spend money on this game? Hell yea. I am ashamed of it but at the same time I don't really give two ♥♥♥♥♥. I give three. Haha what a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ joke. Anyways, Yes I did spend money on it, do I get kills because of the damage boost that comes from these weapons? Yea, I do think that I get some kills because of the paid weapons. However, I have some in-game money bought weapons in my list of weapons too. And I'm glad I use and have those weapons as well because they are on par with some of the paid weapons. Am I good at the game because of these paid weapons? Lol no, I suck balls. Is my waifu kawaii? Yes. I'm a weeb ♥♥♥♥ even though I don't even watch anime anymore. I enjoy the costumes and designs a lot in this game. There are some that I absolute adore.\n\nHoly ♥♥♥♥ this is long. I don't even write reviews for games.\n\nTL;DR:\nI would say it is a little pay2win but in game money weapons can be on par with paid weapons.\nI play it casually and enjoy the living hell out of it. (Why the hell would there be competitive MV anyways, dafuq.)\nThere are some advanced mechanics in this game that I like and appreciate, which would also help out against those darn pay2win players.\nMost players speak Spanish (And English, there are a few that I've met that don't speak English, unfortunately)\nHackers are present in this game, there are kick protections items (You get those from daily missions, calm down) which I think is just stupid.\nI suck at this game yet I have 145 hours logged onto it. This is my PayDay 2.\n\nWhy the hell did I write such a long review for such a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game?

It's an indie game made by amateurs who gave up the whole game to instead overprice everything to get money. It was going so good but they stopped adding more content and only removed a lot of it and added more events where you give them money instead. Some people say it's pay to win, but it's not very pay to win since I got banned so often for hacking because I was so skilled with the default weapons. Paying only gives random items and you'd have to be extremely lucky to get something useful, and the price of random capsules is incredibly high. Also incredibly swarmed by brazilians.\n\nWow and this game is dead now. They haven't updated for months.","April 18, 2015","false","126.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Yes some people may be to OP but if you can do well with MP weapons then you will do great with the RT ones. The game has many modes such as Capture the Battery, Zombie mode, Team death match, Boss battle, Etc.. As well you may get kicked from the some matches due to people thinking your "hacking" when your good at the game or just plan better then the other players..or its because you are actually hacking.\nThe game includes 7 character modles, 3 girls 4 guys. Each one has there own type of outfits, voices, and taunts.\n\nNow there are capsules that you can spend RT/MP on they each have different things inside, some are unlimited meaning you can keep them forever ( They are hard to get and you will probably spend alot of money unless you VERY lucky ) and some are just for a few days, or a month. Now not every capsule you get will have a weapon or a piece of gear in it, they will probably most likely have little things such as MP or EXP boost, battery charges, MP and other little things that you could use in order to upgrade items.\nThe MP capsules do not have as many choices as the RT capsules for some reason- that I do not know - There are also events mainly in the mornings that grant extra MP/EXP for 1-2 hours (that iv seen for myself)\n\nYes there will be other people who are on a much higher level then you, but just because they are doesnt mean that you still cant kick their butts, now if you give TDM a try and you encounter a higher level, and say your level 5 and someone on the other team is around level 20-30 dont think just because their higher means there better, test your own skills out and see what you need to fix, such as sensitivity or acceleration, or emprove something such as aiming, or certain weapons you want to work on more.\nThere is a game mode/match mode (what ever) that is called a "Schrimmage" in which you can play with friends or random people, your not scored and you never die.\n\nNow than to the shopping area\n-MP items are the only items in the shop that can be bought as an unlimited ~ RT items can only last atleast a month depending on how much RT you spend on the item\n-MP accessories are not unlimited and can last aslong as a month as well\n\nThen again there is a Coupon Store\n-In order to buy things from this store you must first get 'coupons' now coupons can only be gotten from trying to get items from the capsule machine which give 1 per spin if your lucky, second way is to long on every day for a week, at the end of the week you sometimes get a box, they box has unlimited items and other things such as coins, MP. items that help upgrade and all them goodies, but you can on get one item from that box and its random, of course Microvolts changes the daily login items at some points but from what iv seen its between 1-2 months maybe longer depending on the items or when ever they wish to change it.\n\nOh yes, there are people who may not speak your language, now if your like me and can only speak English the NA server may not be the best although if you wish to not lag as much and dont really care about talking then that would be a good server to pick. The other server is the Europe server, they on the other hand have more people who speak english rather than another language.\n\nNow then, they added a new feature and if your new you may like it, everytime you level you get this little box with items inside - Though there isnt any gear inside id say its came in handy alot with upgrades and sometimes when I need MP its a big help instead of trying to farm MP.","December 20, 2014","true","583.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The main reason I quit was that the leases were too expensive for a F2P'r to afford. I'd been meaning to revisit it once I saw it pop up on Steam and I recently did just that. Not only are the leases still too expensive but the hacking has gotten out of control. When I first played it there were hackers, of course, but nothing aside from aimbotting and wallhacks, the usual stuff. Now they have full-auto rocket launchers, shooting through walls and super jumping hacks. I played for about 3 hours and only got into one legit match.

For some time now, the development has been communicating with the players, in order to address the issues the game has been dealing with. Some improvements have been made since, but every new patch also adds new bugs to the never ending list of problems. It feels like the company only cares about the money of their players, and they just keep reintroducing new paid content instead of fixing the obvious problems. I actually used to work for the company and was part of the journalist team in 2014; I was in Forbidden and other well known clans and call some of the old players my best friends - hence, it makes me even sadder when it comes to downvoting this game which used to be so cool.\n\nDon't install this game if you have serious hopes in it. As a very old player, I know how difficult it is to master the play style of MicroVolts; "swapping", etc, is not so easy. The game is not really newbie-friendly. Furthermore, the game has been exploding with hackers, and no matter what the development does, the hackers keep coming back. From jump hacks to auto-aim, bored players can find anything. Sadly, the game developers now also do not care about their devoted players anymore. They have been re-releasing old sets and weapons, without giving the original owners any compensation. Anybody who cares about their customers gives the old and devoted ones something in return, in order to make sure that they will stay customers. A lot of players have been leaving, and I do not recommend installing the game. It's fun to play with friends, but that's it. It's been slowly dying and it feels like the company itself has given up.\n\n\nPositive aspects:\n\n+ anime graphics\n+ moderate shooter difficulty (aiming, shooting)\n+ active forum\n+ many characters to choose and more costumes to come\n\n\nNegative:\n\n- difficult to master\n- toxic community (and no option to report toxic behavior)\n- hackers\n- bad moderators (some are too young for the job and, also, rarely online)\n- no compensation for beta/ and early players\n- new bugs with every update, and no fixing of old bugs\n- many unfixed glitches\n- huge gap between paid weapon and free weapon\n- in-game cash is expensive","August 16, 2014","false","195.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","2"

Its the clearest definition of P2W, if you don't pay, you're left with weaker weapons and worse stats and you inevitably lose.  Its a shame, the core gameplay is fun: fast paced, a big inventory of weapons, and you can dress up your waifu in kawaii-esque outfits.  But you have to put down a decent amount of money to be on par with everyone else.\n\nAlso, compared to most shooters, these maps are terrible.

MicroVolts is a MMO Third Person Shooter that also features real money in game purchases. Recently, the game has turned into a case of Pay To Win. Now then, someone can get along with skills alone, as I've seen in a recent match, but most low levels have Pay To Win items, so it's hard to outmatch them if you're like me, and not very good at the game. Also, from experience, MicroVolts seems very easy to hack. I've had a run in with several hackers and unless you can take an obvious screenshot of someone hacking, it's hard for the devs to put a stop to it. The in game community of MicroVolts also tends to be either rude, angry, racial, or overall annoying. You will be insulted for every little thing, be kicked for no reason at all, or will be accused of hacking if you're a very good player.\nAnother thing is, if you do pay for Rock Tokens, the real money currency, the game features a gambling system of acquiring items, which means, you'll have a chance to get a good item or not. For me, the gambling process is very addicting, and based on certain characters, you're mostly trying to get individual items, such as leggings, tops, pants, hairs, ect. and not a full set.","April 13, 2015","false","363.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There is nothing wrong with my connection ffs i can download 10 GB file in 30min while my brothers watch youtube vids and downloading other stuff.\nit is also hard to complete a match or even have a decent one without the game either crashes or filled with some kind of hackers.\n\nthe devs are just filling their game with new stuff but forgets to fix the older ones,\nthey do not improve the game but filling it with stuff that people can spend money on which means the game is a unfair pay to win.\nthe support is also horrible try their forum, people i have seen had sent a ticket and waited on answers for several weeks and still waiting.","March 23, 2014","false","0.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

MicroVolts is a MMO Third Person Shooter that also features real money in game purchases. Recently, the game has turned into a case of Pay To Win. Now then, someone can get along with skills alone, as I've seen in a recent match, but most low levels have Pay To Win items, so it's hard to outmatch them if you're like me, and not very good at the game. Also, from experience, MicroVolts seems very easy to hack. I've had a run in with several hackers and unless you can take an obvious screenshot of someone hacking, it's hard for the devs to put a stop to it. The in game community of MicroVolts also tends to be either rude, angry, racial, or overall annoying. You will be insulted for every little thing, be kicked for no reason at all, or will be accused of hacking if you're a very good player.\nAnother thing is, if you do pay for Rock Tokens, the real money currency, the game features a gambling system of acquiring items, which means, you'll have a chance to get a good item or not. For me, the gambling process is very addicting, and based on certain characters, you're mostly trying to get individual items, such as leggings, tops, pants, hairs, ect. and not a full set.","April 13, 2015","false","363.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There is nothing wrong with my connection ffs i can download 10 GB file in 30min while my brothers watch youtube vids and downloading other stuff.\nit is also hard to complete a match or even have a decent one without the game either crashes or filled with some kind of hackers.\n\nthe devs are just filling their game with new stuff but forgets to fix the older ones,\nthey do not improve the game but filling it with stuff that people can spend money on which means the game is a unfair pay to win.\nthe support is also horrible try their forum, people i have seen had sent a ticket and waited on answers for several weeks and still waiting.","March 23, 2014","false","0.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I have about 550 hours of gameplay.\n\nThis game is really fun, whether or not you want to play competitive or just for fun, there is modes for both of that. I play for fun, While I'm pretty decent with a 2.0 KD ratio, I still play for fun and for fun only, there's zombie mode, boss battle, single player, and the multiplayer games are just as fun.\n\nTo the people that say it is pay to win, trust me, it doesn't help as much as you think. The paid currency is called RT, and the regular currency is called MP. I have an account with all RT gear and with all MP gear, yes my account with RT may be better at gameplay, my MP account is good too, and i'm not even that great at the game, if you learn the mechanics properly and you're skillfull at shooters, you can be better than anyone with RT.\n\nNot only this, but they have a section on the website where you can earn free RT, through mobile application downloads, website registrations and surveys. I have made about 50,000 RT through this ($50) worth of currency.\n\nI am a beta player, and the game has changed a lot, and it is really still fun, give it a try!\n\n","January 16","true","44.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I mainly play melee only because it is the most balanced I feel. Even if someone is full tank its still only 2 shots to the face with a tracker head. The maps are beautiful with lense flares for the sund and they really submerge you into this beautiful toy world. The character roster (as of today) inclue the figures Knox, Kai, C.H.I.P, Simon, $harkill, Naomi, Pandora, Amelia, and Sophitia in which each has their own default stats that can be changed by buying mp clothes, or spending your money to get amazing outfits (which is kind of an addiction of mine). They have a capsule machine that you can spend al your money in and its so much fun to do, but leaves you ♥♥♥♥♥♥ if you didnt get the part you wanted.

The characters were pretty and I really liked the customation option. Voice acting was good.\nAnd that's it...\nEverything else was bad. Tutorial was painful because it couldn't be skipped.

Yes its another shooter, though in third person, so i guess its like a version of Team Fortress 2 (TF2), TF2 being better though, obviously. Anyway, I love this game, especially since my TF2 isnt working so I find it an alternative. Its really fun to play, always users so you never get bored. I like most of the game modes.

I do advise you look at the tutorial videos in the stem forums to learn how to play 'efectivly' or you may not live to see many kills.  Other then the constant need to log back in at first, both steam and non steam it has a very good setup.  It is more a Pay to Improve vs a Pay to Win, everything can be gotten via 'mystery capsules' it's just chance to get what you want.  The capsule option also allows free to play players to also gain what they need/want.\n\nThere are a few random crashes, but when the game plays fine it is worth the time and effort.  It's a 3/5 in my book, and rather adicting once you actualy get into it.","July 24, 2014","true","35.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I do advise you look at the tutorial videos in the stem forums to learn how to play 'efectivly' or you may not live to see many kills.  Other then the constant need to log back in at first, both steam and non steam it has a very good setup.  It is more a Pay to Improve vs a Pay to Win, everything can be gotten via 'mystery capsules' it's just chance to get what you want.  The capsule option also allows free to play players to also gain what they need/want.\n\nThere are a few random crashes, but when the game plays fine it is worth the time and effort.  It's a 3/5 in my book, and rather adicting once you actualy get into it.","July 24, 2014","true","35.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's just as fun as it looks. It's probably one of the most unique TPS games I've played in a long time. It really does feel like playing with your toys.\n\nIt's worth the free price if you ask me. DLC is only cosmetics as far as I care. Give it a whirl. You won't regret it. I think.\n\n\n\n\nThat's what I thought before giving the game more time. My opinion has changed for the most part. The Pay to Win mechanic is basically the blood in this game's once pure veins. I've heard from a lot of veterans to the game that the game was a lot of fun originally.\n\nApparently that has changed because of the pay to win mechanic. And I can see why. Any free to play game that forces you to invest in the game with real world cash as a necessity makes me sick. It's a loathed business practice that needs to stop cold turkey because it ruins the experience for those who can't even afford to invest money in the game.\n\nNot only that, but the community is absolute garbage. It's a cesspool of asshats, possibly from obscure third-world countries, that try WAY too hard to win, try to add vote-kicking to the competitive edge, or are just generally so entitled they think "god weapons" (yes, the p2w system is THAT bad) are not good enough.It's just as bad, if not worse, than the stereotypical image branded onto Call of Duty, except you leave on the branding iron too long.\n\nAnd the gameplay. Oh, god the gameplay. There are so many experience-ruining exploits (i.e. bunnyhopping, quickswap) and the fact you can use weapons (which are usually cash-bought and overpowered [again, pay to win]) in such asinine ways that it makes me squeeze my mouse like a stress ball in frustration sometimes. Not from the fact that I can't get a single kill in some situations, but from the fact that the developers thought that the only thing they should do to remedy the situation is having a crappy anti-cheat program that doesn't even work (according to other players) be co-installed with the game, rather than actually commiting to the game and fixing these problems and instead either making more pay-currency-only items that will further alienate the non-paying players or working on some fantasy rpg moba (that is yet to be released at the time of this re-review) that will probably follow the same fate as this game.\n\nIn conclusion, this game is an example of what happens when developers let their greed take over game developement. In my opinion, I don't think anyone would care if Valve took this game off of the store list. And frankly neither would I. But instead, I say it should still be on the list, not for the fact that I still kinda like this game despite my complaints and would be willing to return to it once in a while, but rather it be an example of what NOT to do when making a game that is supposed to be "free to play".\n\nSeriously, Rock Hippo. You don't even want to improve the problems with actual gameplay?","May 7, 2015","false","41.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Animations are a little blocky at times, and  there used to be lag problems.  Only downside is it's a lot like Team Fortress 2, with the only thing different that it brings to the table is a larger focus on full character customization.  Even still, though, items are only owned for a certain amount of time instead of being permanent so if you're not for that kind of system then this isn't for you.","July 5, 2012","true",""," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
