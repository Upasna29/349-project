Dawn of the robot empire is just in it’s infancy and only scratching its potential. Please don’t stop developing this little gem because you are really close of giving us a robotron like VR fix.  I also see great potential in your boss battle with the snakebot.\n\nSuggestion to the dev...Imagine the player being able to dispatch robots from all sides while being able to spear the robot, lift him up, take a few blasts and then throw or bash the little bugger into the ground hulk style. Revenge for all those quarters dropped into robotron in VR bliss.","May 17","true","1.4"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Gravity on shots adds to the skill needed. Shield and stick thing is just cool as hell. Havent got past wave 2 yet but I am very impressed. Also the Dev is super involved","May 18","true","0.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I once found myself with a meteor shower while in the main screen and just tried whacking them with the staff.\n\nI think this is a great vr introduction game and despite it being repetitive to a point, it holds up very well and im sure the dev(s) will add more content in the future.\n\nWell done you guys, well done.","May 22","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
