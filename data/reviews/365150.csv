Sure, I figured it would be quite similar in concept and overall feel, but this is kind of silly.\n\nThe changes from the basic prototype that I created in the series are pretty lacking. You have a few more levels, but the new levels are not anything special. A few lines of the player movement code has been adjusted slightly, but again, that's nothing. This is pretty much my game, you used my color scheme, you used my models, you used my code, and you even used my name. You had all that given to you, but you still couldn't pull out a more satisfying attempt at a rage-inducer?\n\nThere's no feeling of reward when you complete a level, there's no feeling of defeat when you die, and there sure isn't a feeling of "I can't stop until I've beaten just one more level!"\n\nIf you have so much given to you from that start, I'd think you would have the time to fix some of the issues as well. And what's up with the timer and coin counter still just being thrown into the top left corner? I did that in the series because it didn't matter as a learning experience, not because it looks good.\n\nYou took what I said too literally. When I said "take what you learn here and make an actual game," I meant make an actual game. Not download my assets and SOMEHOW get it published on Steam. This isn't worth near what you're charging for it. Look at the other games in the same price range. You put a week of work into this game and you're charging a pretty penny for it, it isn't going to work out.\n\nI hate that the game isn't good. I really do. I had a video ready to go showing the game off, getting set for the big key giveaway, but then I realized it isn't worth me doing the video or the giveaway. I'm sorry, but you have a lot of work to do before this game is decent.","August 31, 2015","false","5.7"," 114 of 115 people (99%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","99","114","115","7","6"

Unable to design a good platformer or even animate a simple sprite, he provides us with a blue cube in a beige 2D labyrinth made difficult by a 3D camera angle, spikes with overlarge hitboxes, and a timer. A good rage-inducing game 1. gives you something to strive for, and 2. then withholds it, laughing at our puny lack of skill. Since this game fails at step 1, it's not worth playing unless you're friends with the developer; and it's not worth paying for, either.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwuPiaFU37w\n\nP.S.: Sascha, du solltest auf jeden Fall auf syntergames.com ein Impressum einstellen; seit 2012 gilt auch in der Schweiz die Impressumspflicht für gewerblich genutzte Websites.","August 31, 2015","false","0.3"," 40 of 44 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","40","44","2","1"

It's supposed to be this very hard timing oriented game that I assume is supposed to irritate you into rage because you keep making mistakes. However, for me the real challenge was the aspects of the game design itself. I didn't try multiplayer, so that mode isn't being evaluated in this review.\n\nThe goal is to get your square to the home location, and on some levels it's required that you pick up tokens. Other levels require you to finish the level within a certain amount of time. Sometimes the timer kicks in once you get to a certain part of the level. Overall the idea is not very complicated.\n\nSound: No idea, I had it muted while I watched Netflix.\n\nGraphics: This was one of the areas I believe that was unintentional rage. If you're slightly red-green colorblind like a good portion of men, playing the game is more difficult because of the issues with color choice. There is no color blind mode. Further, you NEED to play on the highest graphic setting for level 25. What is the only change that occurs between fastest and this setting? You can see wall shadows which is extremely useful. So, if yoiu want a harder challenge, play on the fastest graphic settings. Other than that, the game has extremely simple graphics which is all it needs. Don't expect a masterpiece.\n\nControls: This was one of the irritating aspects of the game. If you were pushing against a wall in a diagnol direction, you would push into it and then stop. So this could cause problems as you needed precise manuvering. Another issue was if you use the analog stick to control your character, clicking it will activate the level reset. This was my major rage issue. I'd be going along the level just fine, and then accidentally press too hard on the analog stick and it'd reset. Joy2Key would not override this setting either.\n\nRage incoming? Sure due to control issues and graphical issues. The actual gauntlets weren't that hard. They were quite fun, until the combination of all the issues together.\n\nOverall: 4/10 unless you get it on a discount... and even then, it better be cheap. Forget that, wait for a bundle. If you get it that way, then it's worth the time and effort, but $5 as the base pricing is way too high. 25 levels, easy to complete, and honestly not really any replay value at least in single player. Still probably better to skip it: not really satisfying.","May 28","false","2.9"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

Where's the rage? Let me tell you; the level 24 made me hunger for that 13/10...

But I doubt they had this in mind. I just keep hitting the "thumbs down" button because it makes me feel a little better.\n\nWhen I boot up "Go Home - Rage incoming," you know the square that's sometimes centered on the screen at the beginning of a game that gives you the initial set of options? Yeah well, I have that, and It never goes away. If I choose singleplayer, what I get is the surreal experience of guiding the menu screen across a maze. Much of the visibility is obstructed, but it is possible to make it past the spikes to that first goal. When I get there, it seems to reset me to the begining. The "multiplayer" option appears to do nothing.\n\nMy first thought was that this was a joke. THE joke. That "Rage incoming" was somebody's smart*** idea of making a game as broken as it could possibly  be, just to see what happens.\n\nBut a quick look around shows lots of people apparently managing to at least play the game. Would liked to have been one of those people, but under the circumstances, it's easy to feel I'm not missing much.","September 19, 2015","false","0.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

It's like Feel-A-Maze controlled over WASD with Cubes and Spikes. I don't understand why you must rage at all. It has just 25 levels and the player has infinite lives.\n\nAt some point a timer starts and you must get through the obstacles in time. Other levels are without time limit but you have to collect all the yellow cubes in each corner. The challenge of the game is from easy to medium. It's quite easy to beat in 1-2 hours.\n\nThe level design could be more balanced. It doesn't feel like a straight rise of difficulty. Some elements like teleports are just used once. Maybe there are more levels planned in the future. But atm it's just the small package and even without any noticeable story.","September 1, 2015","true","2.2"," 12 of 22 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","12","22","2","0"

It will take around 2 hours to complete the game, based on your skill level. Unfortunately, both the spikes and the enemies are based on cycles - once you know how to avoid them, the same tactic will always work. Therefore the game has no replay-ability. The graphics are simplistic, making the game load very fast and play very fast. However, the harsh hitbox detection (and limited camera angles) make it very easy to get stuck around corners or bump into enemies.\n\nOverall, Go Home - Rage Incoming is a very fun way to kill a few hours. However, I can't say the game warrants such a high price, as many other similarly-priced games contain hundreds of hours of gameplay, with much better graphics. If you can get the game on a good special or as part of a bundle, it's a fun one to pick up.","September 10, 2015","true","2.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"
