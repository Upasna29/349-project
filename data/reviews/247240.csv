Even the most engaging epics (Xenoblade Chronicles, Skyrim, etc) can only hold my attention for a few hours, MAX, before I need to do something else. Maybe it's because they don't feel as rewarding any more, or the stories just aren't as engaging as they used to be, but I know that I peeled off the "hardcore" label from my gamer card long ago.\n\nI tell you this anecdote because I just spent nearly 10 straight hours playing Volgarr, and didn't even realize it.\n\nThis game is a pungent distillation of everything that I loved and hated about video games in the 80's and 90's. Back then, memory was at a premium, so in order to make a game feel like it was worth the $50 price tag, developers make them hard as nails in order to extend the play time you would need to devote in order to complete the game. This meant hours upon hours of committing each level, every enemy and all the boss patterns to muscle memory, and knowing how to react in each situation. It was an arduous process, but when you finally mastered a level and beat the boss, you felt like you had accomplished something. I realized, upon completing Volgarr, that this is what I had been missing from most modern games, where victory is all but ensured.\n\nVolgarr is hard. Words like brutal and unforgiving don't really do it justice. Its smartly hard. I had quite a bit of trouble with the game, and actually gave it up for almost a year after I got stuck on stage 2. When I finally picked it back up this weekend, I approached it as a puzzle game; each encounter, every enemy's placement and movement, was done with care - all I had to do was find the pattern and "solve" the puzzle with Volgarr's moveset. This made every advancement feel like a real victory, and this game is one of the first in a long time to elicit actual cheers of joy when I completed a stage for the first time.\n\nVolgarr never felt cheap, exploitative, or unfair. I died hundreds of times, repeating stages over and over, but it never made me angry or frustrated, only determined. Determined because every playthrough got me a little bit further: into the next room, understanding a new monster's attack pattern, or solving a new section of platforming. Every death had an "aha!" moment attached to it. If I died at a section I had played through before, it was 100% my fault. Overall randomness is low, so it is extremely rare that a strategy you succeeded with once will fail the next time.\n\nI could wax poetic telling you about how good the controls feel, or the quality of graphics and music, but there are lots of other reviews for that. I simply wish to convey how satisfying this game is to play, and how accomplished I felt (and hopefully, you will too) when I beat each and every stage. I experienced a range of emotions, from trepidation, anger, fear and elation, something that few modern games can achieve, even with their grandiose storytelling and advanced visual presentation.\n\nI'm not going to assign a number value to my review, because I think that trying to quantify any gaming experience is fairly pointless. Games aren't commodities with certain valuable characteristics, like a vacuum cleaner or toaster oven. Ultimately, what each person gets out of a game really depends on what they expect, what they like from an interactive experience, and how the game meets those needs. Games, in this regard, are like art, and you can't rate art, you can only relate how it makes you feel.\n\nVolgarr challenged me, it made me feel young again, and it gave me a sense of accomplishment.\n\nI dig it.","September 29, 2014","true","14.3"," 216 of 230 people (94%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","94","216","230","3","11"

And what a game it's been. A testament to classic, hardcore, do-or-die Arcade platformers, Volgarr the Viking never disappointed me. Each level was cooler than the one before and I've only even played the "normal" levels. That's right, the game has "hardcore" levels which you unlock by basically playing the game flawlessly.\n\nIt's hard and the "checkpoints" aren't generous, if at all present. Each level is divided in 2 parts, with a boss at the end of the second. If you stop playing, you can skip levels, but you'll always start at the first part. I had to replay each level from the start a few times and didn't really have a problem with it. It's that good.\n\nI've read a few negative comments on its brutal "save"-system which isn't really present at all. But don't let that hinder you. It's fantastic, stylish and I love it. It's metal.

It is very challenging. It isn't a bad game by any means. In fact, it is very well designed action platformer;  it is just very challenging. I only recommend this game, if you want a very challenging but good game. If you are looking for a game you can breeze through, stay far, far away from this game.\n\nTo give you an idea of how hard this game is,  I can't believe I've been playing this game for over an hour, and I still haven't beaten the first level. I have never played a game, aside from the original Ghosts n Goblins, where I haven't beaten the first level within an hour. And I bet you it will take several more hours before I finally get good enough to beat the first level.\n\nThis game is very challenging for the following reasons.\n\nFirst of all, it only takes two hits to get killed in this game. You can increase your hit points to three hits with an armor upgrade (so you can get hit no more than two times), but that's about it. By default, you better not get more than once, or you are dead.\n\nThe levels are long, and full of hazards and enemies that can kill you. The checkpoints are few and far between, so you have to last for a very long time without getting hit. Lastly, many of the enemies and hazard are VERY cheap, and there is no way you can avoid them  on your first encounter. Sometimes enemies and hazard can appear out of no where and kill you before you can even react. This can be especially frustrating when you made considerable progress, and then you are sent back to a checkpoint, losing five or more minutes of progress in the process. The only way you can avoid these hazards is to first get killed , know in advance that the hazard is coming, and then avoid it.\n\nAlso, you have to beat an entire world/level before you can save, and the worlds in this game are very large. If only you can save your progress and start from each sub-section of each world. That would be nice. But no, this game requires you to beat a very long and difficult level in just one-sitting, so you better have good endurance.\n\nBasically, the only way you can make ANY progress in this game is to play the levels over and over again until you can reach the end in one sitting.  You need perfect precision to avoid getting hit in this game. In other words, you need VERY GOOD hand-eye coordination, and LOTS of trial and error before you can beat this game. You need to memorize the entire level, where each hazard and enemy is, and play almost perfectly (get hit no more than once) to reach each few-and-far-between checkpoint and beat each level.\n\nLuckily, this game gives you unlimited continues. You can continue from the same checkpoint as many times as you want. Thank god that's the case, because you will die many times until you reach the next few and far between checkpoint. If you had limited continues, this game would go from very challenging to downright frustrating and near impossible.\n\nControl-wise, this game is very responsive and accurate. The only downside is that, like in Ghosts n Goblins, your character cannot change his direction in mid jump, so you need to be very precise in the timing and positioning of your jumping; otherwise, you will get hit and DIE.\n\nOverall, this is a well-designed, albeit very challenging, action platformer. It remains me alot of Ghosts n Goblins, because of its stiff jumping mechanics, challenging level design, two-hit deaths, and medieval/fantasy setting in the format of an action platformer.","May 15, 2014","true","2.2"," 60 of 65 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","60","65","0","2"

Amazing, right?\n- Attack with your sword, jumping, crouching or not.\n- Throw spears, both standing upright and while jumping. When you get the iron shield (Thor's Shield), you can hold the spear and let loose SUPERCHARGED spears which usually skewers all enemies it passes through instead of just killing the first thing it hits.\n- Dodge roll, which lets you pass through most enemies to get a better angle for attack, or for just simply getting through small enterances.\n\nImportant to note (and this is one of the games best mechanics) is that thrown spears will get stuck in walls it hit, making it a platform to jump up to. This gives you tons of possibilites and great potential to work around certain difficult places by using the room to your advantage.\n\nWhen in the air you can also press down to make Völgarr point his sword downwards, making the impact you make, rather messy (if you catch my drift)\n\nYou can also double-jump which makes you pull out your sword and perform a somersault which is a good way to challenge enemies midair or secure landing on a platform. Of course it also helps your platforming as you can change direction in your otherwise fixed jump arcs.\n\nNote that there are many ways to use these techniques in conjunction or in different ways to make for some very interesting solutions! (Example: Try jumping, point your sword down and successfully touch an enemy and immediately use your second jump!)\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nYou start with a simple sword and later you can find chests with upgrades like a wooden shield, an iron shield, a helmet and lastly a great sword of fire!\n\nWhen you are hit you lose the last gear you obtained and you have to find another chest to restore it, if you get down to only a sword left and get hit, you die.\n\nSpeaking of dying, you have in the regular levels only 2 respawn points per world and it's in the beginning of the level and one half-way through (I just call it stage/phase/part 2), so if you die you have to often play through larger parts of the level.\nIt sort of becomes a longer, adventurous version of Super Meat Boy, you get a level with fixed enemy positions (most of the time) and you get to learn by trying.\nWhen you finally beat the level you will most likely have remembered every single enemy position and how you best handle them.\n\nIf you manage to play the levels without getting hit you will start finding treasure instead of gear as you hit your upgrade cap. The gold acts as a hi-score along with your completion time but what matters more is if you find Warrior's Spirits which lets you play the special levels if you complete the level without dying (you lose one spirit per death).\n\nThe game have regular levels and special levels, the difference between them is that you have unlimited retries for regular levels but in the special levels you have as much extra lives as you have found Warrior's Spirits the levels before.\nIf you manage to complete the special words and find all the Runes you get the best ending, if you just complete the special worlds without runes you get the second best ending and if you don't beat the game through the special levels you get the "worst" ending.\nSo it's really challenging to get the best ending but just completing the game for the worst ending will be a challenge enough for your first playthrough and will feel rewarding enough (believe me on this one!). Later you can try and go for death-less runs, damage-less runs, speedruns or try and collect achievements and get all endings.\n\nFINAL WORDS:\nVolgarr the Viking is an absolutely stunning game which will test your limits. Whether or not you have never bought a game in the "retro" section or you are tired of "another Pixel Art Indie game". I definetly think you should look past that and give this game a try.\nOne of the few gripes is that the game can be rather short if you turn out to be a fast learner,\nWhatever you decide to do you will get a lot of hours of fun, charming and passionately crafted gaming in world that wants nothing more than to break you!\n\nI strongly recommend this game if you want some classic fun, a good challenge or to just make blood and bones fly all over the screen.","September 22, 2013","true","42.1"," 69 of 79 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","69","79","0","0"

With only 6 levels each only taking around 10 minutes to complete...IF you know what you're doing.

My parents were pretty lenient, I was allowed pretty free reign on what I did growing up.  It was pretty sweet.   The reason I decided to bore you with this little anecdote mind you...is because one of the few times I remember getting banned from my Super Nintendo for a week was due to Super Ghouls and Ghosts.   That game was hard as hell and instigated fits of anger on a regular basis.  Controllers were broken, swears were shouted loudly, and about the time the controller bounced off the screen of the TV as I screamed "♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥!", it was all over.\n\nDespite all that?  I still loved it.\n\nEnter Volgarr the Viking.  That little love song to Ghouls & Ghosts was written, because Volgarr is a love song written to Ghouls & Ghosts.  The game feels straight out of the Super Nintendo long box.  The challenges are unrelenting and difficult from the very beginning.  Yet, there's a lot of nostalgia and enjoyment packed in here that leads you to keep hitting retry and going back over the same deaths time and time again.  Veterans of Volgarr the Viking will say that the game is easy and comes down to memorization.  Sure, it does come down to memorization.  That memorization comes from a drive to perfect the game and push through to the end that leads to you eventually become a master of the game.  Just like its predecessor, Super Ghouls and Ghosts.  (Important note:  No, I haven't mastered yet.  By god, I will though, just to spite this game!)\n\nAnd yes, the loud swearing still happens with Volgarr.  Not the controller breaking though.   I mean, I'm an old man now; I'm above throwing and breaking controllers.  Not from any kind of evolved self-control mind you, simply because I know what it costs to replace those things!

That's because regardless of how I feel about it, Volgarr exists to do one thing, and that is imitate the old hard-as-balls 16-bit platformers of yore. And it does it really, really, really well.\n\nYou play Volgarr the Viking, unsurprisingly, risen from his grave by some totally metal deity to kill a whole bunch of everything. He controls like a slightly less-sticky Castlevania protagonist, with no air control unless you double-jump, certain attacks locking him in place, and being launched backwards (usually into pits) every time he gets hit. He does have a bevy of moves like a downward strike, a roll, and some very useful spears to throw that can also form platforms. It feels just like playing a classic SNES side-scroller, and that extends to the graphics and sounds as well. Pixel blood and bones fly as you hack and slash through the game's many varied levels.\n\nIF you can get to them. The make-or-break issue with Volgarr is how much patience you have for punishingly hard platforming. The game uses a very Ghosts 'n' Goblins system where you find bits of armor to bolt on to yourself that then get knocked off a couple pieces at a time by enemies. Your shield is one of those pieces, and if you lose it, certain traps are going to be all but impassable. This is to say nothing of the many bottomless pits and trap enemies waiting just off screen to knock you into them. All of this would be fine, except that the levels are made up of two quite lengthy sections with only a single checkpoint between them. This means any mistakes you make are punished with redoing the last couple minutes of exacting platforming again. And with no checkpoint before bosses, just learning their patterns or performing less than perfectly can force you to replay 5+ minutes of level you've already had to suffer through.\n\nThis to me is just straight-up bad design, evidenced by how few games make use of similarly punishing systems now. It is forgiven only because it was the standard for NES classics such as Castlevania and Mega Man, except that even those games had multiple checkpoints per level. It becomes a question of how much of your time a game is allowed to waste when you make a mistake, because doing the same level opening ten times because you can't quite get a boss's pattern down immediately is very much a waste of time. Modern games like Dark Souls have found elegant solutions to this problem, such as allowing you to accumulate resources across attempts. Volgarr makes no provision for that, forcing the same actions over and over until it (hopefully) becomes muscle memory.\n\nI really did hate Volgarr when I started playing it, but after a little more time with it I came to at least appreciate what it represents. When I was a kid, I had the patience to beat my head against Ninja Gaiden II for weeks and weeks until I could finally finish it. I don't have the time or the inclination for that kind of dedicated memorization anymore, but I can see where there might still be space for it. Volgarr is very much not for everyone and smacks of the kind of game that gets recommended by everyone and played by no one, but if you really, truly are looking for that brick wall NES difficulty curve, look no further.","December 3, 2015","true","1.1"," 42 of 46 people (91%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","91","42","46","6","0"

You can't change direction mid jump (except by double jumping), your melee attack is very short range, and your projectile locks you in place for a second unless you do it in mid-air, so you really have to commit to your attacks in this game.\n\nIt's pretty much a thinking man's action game. It rewards precise timing and execution, but it's very difficult to get out of bad situations unscathed once you get put in them. The emphasis here is more on carefully figuring out how to safely go about things and avoid getting trapped, and the game is excellently designed in this regard: there's tons of different ways to get past obstacles, the level design is really clever with a lot of attention to detail, and the game generally feels pretty fair even when it's hard (though some of the bosses do jump off the deep end into pure trial and error).\n\nSo if you want a thinking man's hack and slash platformer that doesn't leave you feeling "oh, I should have reacted to that faster" when you die, but rather "oh, I should have thought that through better", than consider Volgarr since it does a fantastic job of accomplishing that.","November 30, 2013","true","7.0"," 47 of 54 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","47","54","0","3"

Don't listen to them.  The implementation of the "Double Jump" makes the mechanic very flexible and versatile.  You can initiate a double jump at any point in the ark, and in any direction, giving the player ample control.  It all feels very natural and intuitive.\n\nAlthough some weak enemies respawn at a few set locations in each level, the majority of the enemies are completely predictable, appearing in the same locations and behaving the same way every time.  This makes the game feel more like a puzzle-platformer to me.  "Solving" levels requires figuring out what sequence of jumps, spears, and sword attacks to use, and remembering the enemy placement and patterns.  Some reflexes and good timing are required, but learning the levels is the most important thing.\n\nIf you get stuck, keep persevering and experimenting with different approaches.  Eventually you'll discover a viable strategy!  I recommend NOT watching a walkthrough or guide before solving the levels for yourself, since that's where most of the satisfaction comes from.

Well, Volgarr the Viking is their grandson.\n[TL;DR at the bottom as usual]\n\n1) INTRODUCTION\nThis is a game that, for those who were born in the 80's like me, rings many bells (Ghosts 'n Goblins, anyone?). Volgarr is an old style 2D arcade platform that shares many aspects with games like the one I just mentioned, first of all: the difficulty. You WILL die in this game, so many times that you will reach new levels of frustration that you didn't even know they existed (unless you already experimented them by playing videogames during the 80's and early 90's ... I did). However, even as I died every 10 steps, I couldn't stop playing. The game purpose is to make you learn by your mistakes; did you try to kill that enemy by throing a spear at him but he killed you ? That must be the wrong approach then, keep that in mind and try again. Learning each level by heart is the key to achieve victory: one step too much, one hit of your sword that is not timed correctly, a double-jump too high and you're one step closer to your doom. Oh, I almost forgot, did you see that hole in the wall that shoots arrows ? No? Ow, sorry you're dead.\n\n2)TECHINICAL ASPECTS\n***GAMEPLAY 9/10\n2D sidescroll platform, there isn't much you can do. 4 movements : Left, Right, Jump, Crouch and 4 actions: roll, sword hit, throw javelin, die. Ok, that was a joke... you can even block with your shield by standing still, so I guess there are 5 actions you can perform. Also, your javelins can be thrown at walls to create platforms (usually secrets are hidden high up in the levels). There is also a zoom key that will allow you to see further than usual and you can toggle it, it is useful for obvious reasons and you basically play with that always on, I don't see why you shouldn't.\nGood thing about the game is that you can play with a keyboard or a joypad, and you can bind any key as you see fit. Speaking of actions and buttons, I wish there was another action you could perform, which I believe it's kinda coomon in games like this one. I'm referring to the action that allows you to jump down a platform by passing through it. Usually you can do that by pressing down+jump, but hitting those keys will make you roll instead. I guess this is a choice made by the devs rather than a flaw in the game, I admit that kind of action would have made my life easier in some occasions.\nAs I said before, you are challenged by the difficulty of the game, if you die you start from the beginning, no savegames, and no checkpoints until you reach the end of the level and kill the boss. Then you can start the game from the latest level reached (but with basic equipment).\nYes, you have some equipment and it represents your total hit points. You start with a sword, a wooden shield and unlimited javelins. You get hit once, you lose your shield (you can block attack with the shield but only 2 or 3, then it breaks); you get hit twice, you die. If you manage to find equipment, without getting hit, you gain more equipment and hitpoints: a better shield that can withstand unlimited hits, a helmet that will boost your attack speed and a flaming sword that does double damage. There is also a special item hidden in every level: Thor's Mjolnir. This is basically an ♥♥♥ saver in case you get hit; the power granted by the hammer will wipe almost everything on screen and you will lose its power but not your equipment.\n\n***STORY ???/10\nYou are a viking raised from the dead by Odin, you go chop chop and that's all. No storytelling at all, this game is minimalistic [<---overstatement] on this aspect. That's the way it was in the 80's, the limited memory space available didn't allow for cutscenes or much text on screen and the game strengths were its gameplay and graphics. However, even though this game doesn't need a story to be played, I would heve been happy to hear something more than "Rise Warrior!" spoken by Odin. "Yeah I have risen, now what Odin? You want foot massage? Coffe? Ow, killing! Sure! Sorry, I should have guessed. Killing, ok, but what ? Everythig ? Well, allright, no problem, cheers mate, see ya later!"\nAnyways, I don't think I can judge something that isn't there, but only the fact that is missing. The game seems to function perfectly even without a story, so it's not much of a bad thing, but still I feel it would have added some epicness to the game.\n\n***GRAPHICS 9/10\nPure 80's 2D style, I like that. Sprites and animations make you go back in time (if you have been). If you didn't grow up whit games like Contra, Gosts 'n Goblins or any other similar titles you might not feel the same as I did while playing Volgarr. Animations are simple, both yours and those of your enemies, maybe a bit too much, but there is nothing wrong with that if you think about what Volgarr the Viking wants to be: an homage to the classical era of videogames.\n\n***SOUND 9/10\nI had goosebumps when I first heard Odin's words: "Rise warrior!". It reminded me of a game I used to play on the SEGA Mega Drive: "Altered Beast". In that game you were, like Volgarr, resurrected from your grave by some sorcerer who spoke almost the same words "Rise from your grave!". Maybe I'm too nostalgic, but I'm almost sure that's been done purposely as an homage to that game, which is much alike Volgarr.\nFor what concerns the rest of the sounds in the game, I can say that "Volgarr the Viking" is coherent with the 80's style even under this aspect.\n\n3) TL;DR\nIf you have played hard platform games during the 80's and loved them, this is the game for you.\nVolgarr will keep you playing for hours challenging your memory, your refelxes and, most of all, your patience.\n\nOverall score 8/10","April 19, 2015","true","15.9"," 23 of 29 people (79%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","79","23","29","4","0"

Really, this is executed with perfection on what it proposes which is to have a game that punishes every mistake harshly but provides controls that are perfectly responsive in a way that once you understand your character and your enemies fully, everytime you die you can blame no one but yourself.\n\nSome people are just gonna play half an hour and say it is crap because they didn't have time to understand the controls. The jumping mechanics are pretty weird at first because you don't have full control of your character once you're in the air, it's only possible to change the direction you're moving if you use the second jump, therefore you must plan carefuly where you want to go before inputing the jump command.\n\nFor me the difficulty is comparable to the "Souls" series. You must proceed every stage slowly, paying attention to everything that's happening. Trying to learn how each enemy works. It's really really rare for you to get attacked or fall into a trap without an opportunity to react, therefore the luck factor is kept to a minimum, After a while you'll be able to complete each stage in a blink and it'll feel so good!\n\nI've just finished it and the difficulty was just on point the whole game aside from maybe the 2nd boss that was just annoying because it required memorising its complicated pattern.\n\nIt's worth pointing out that the exploration is pretty enjoyable! It has a mechanic of fixing a spear into the walls in order to access different places, I've never seen anything like that in other games and it is really well implemented but it's not the focus.\n\nTruly one of the best games I've ever played on steam.","July 3, 2015","true","8.2"," 19 of 24 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","19","24","0","3"

This game is incredible. It might be a bit discouraging because the difficulty tends to ramp up quickly. Especially the first and second world are good examples of this. But as challenging the game is, it is even more rewarding.\n\nI love the feeling of flawlessly beating a boss which at first I couldn't even reach without dying 50 times. That's the beauty of the game. It rewards you by showing how you slowly got better. There's little to no randomness or luck to the game. Every single time you get hit it's your own fault, and if you manage to overcome a situation without getting hit, it's all thanks to you: the player.\n\nAs you progress farther and farther in the game the areas you already cleared before become a breeze and you can easily jump, roll and slash through hordes of enemies that you used to have trouble with. I never felt a situation or enemy was particularly unfair. Got hit by an arrow? Duck faster next time! Fell into a pit? Time your jumps better! Like I explained before, the hazards in every world won't change, your skill will. Greatly.\n\nIf anyone who reads this is having a hard time completing the game, or heck, even the first world.

The player controls a Viking that must fight his way through an army of monsters.  By the way that the game looks and plays, it has a style similar to Taito’s Rastan, a classic from 1987.\n\nOne thing that makes traveling through the levels more interesting is that your weapons are for more than just combat.  For ranged combat, you have a spear to attack from a safe distance.  However, it is also useful for navigation.  If there is a wall that is too tall to jump over, throwing a powered-up spear will cause it to stick to the wall acting as a ledge.  By making the weapons multifaceted, it makes for some well-designed platforming.\n\nOf course, the combat is the real draw of the game.  With the simple and tight controls, fighting is as easy as it was back in the 8-bit days.  As for the fighting, the action is as varied as the environments.  In one stages, you are dodging spears while sliding down slopes.  In another, you are fending off mermen while riding on a raft.  With the action constantly changing, it makes you want to continue progressing throughout the game.\n\nOne problem about this progressing is that it is too generous with progressing.  If your character dies, you lose half your treasure and return to the latest checkpoint.  Otherwise, the game does not hurt you.  With unlimited lives and saved progress, it makes finishing too easy.  Having either is good, but having both takes away from the old-school feeling that the game was going for.  In order to make the game play like it should, the player should stick to a lives cap.  Otherwise, it is possible to finish in a single day.\n\nEven though the combat is good, the enemies, while interesting, are not as deep as the combat.  The stages have its own enemies to make each location visually interesting.  The problem with this is that there are only a few enemy types in each stage.  In most cases, it is only a palette swap to turn the same enemy into a new one.  Once you see the first enemy, expect to see it repeat constantly until reaching the boss.  This might have been acceptable in the 80s and 90s, but nowadays, more variety is expected.","December 30, 2014","true","3.5"," 21 of 33 people (64%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","64","21","33","3","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/indieluchador/recommended/247240/","indieluchador","Indie Luchador","http://steamcommunity.com/id/indieluchador/","398 products in account",""The Sega Genesis." It's often the answer that I give when asked what my favorite game console is.  It was a great console with a lot of hidden gems and an appealing art style.  But the Genesis somehow never released a game called Volgarr the Viking.  Wait, this just in-- Volgarr is a brand new game from Crazy Viking Studios and Adult Swim Games, but it looks and feels as if it would have been right at home on the Sega Genesis. Hell, it even has a Genesis-inspired manual.\nTransient\nVolgarr the Viking is exactly what it should be: an assault to the senses of those willing to take the plunge into this ultra-violent romp through a minion-drenched hell.\n\nTo many that have gotten their hands on it, Volgarr has chewed them up and spit them out. The difficulty seems to be too much. The hardest thing about Volgarr is understanding one main rule that was shared with me: there is nothing unfair about Volgarr.\n\n\n\nSo, now comes the hardest part-- putting what Volgarr is into words.\n\nVolgarr is an old-school 16-bit side-scrolling beat-'em-up in the vein of Castlevania and Golden Axe. But what sets this game apart is the extreme difficulty when it comes to figuring out what every enemy's attack pattern is. Every enemy attacks in a certain manner, and Volgarr (while only using two buttons other than the movement keys) always has a way to dispatch them.\n\nThe other beautiful thing that this game adds is how Volgarr traverses the world that he is a part of. Volgarr is a viking, not an all-powerful god. He still has to climb ropes to get to higher places, and in some cases he has to throw his spears into walls to make new platforms. This becomes one of the most satisfying things about this game, especially when those spears double up as a weapon or a way to block projectiles from above.\n\nTo add to this already epic adventure, Volgarr the Viking has a decent soundtrack. It fits the action, and the Clash of the Titans-esque world. While it isn't the best music ever heard in a game, it totally matches the action and look of the game. Just don't go in thinking that there will be epic viking chants.\nTransient\nSo, if Volgarr the Viking sounds this great there must be something horrendously wrong with it deep down, right? No. There are some things that some gamers will have difficulty with. Problems like the extremely brutal checkpoint system. Currently, if  players die, they will find themselves all the way back at the beginning of the area of the screen they are on. This can mean losing 5-10 minutes of progress. Thankfully, players will learn something new along the way every time. This system seems crazy in a world of extreme simplicity, frequent 2-minute checkpoints, and hand-holding tutorials that never fully release players from its grasp, but players willing to stick with Volgarr will feel some of the greatest satisfaction in recent memory.\n\nVolgarr has so much to offer for players that want to feel a deep satisfaction when completing an area, or personal task. The difficulty only adds to the dark style of the game, and everything fits perfectly into the presentation of this game. Volgarr the Viking is the type of experience that has been missing from the gaming world. Do yourself a favor and pick up the best offering from Adult Swim Games yet.\n\nFinishing move:\n\nI love Volgarr the Viking. Like, really love it. It brings back so many memories from my childhood gaming career. I wasn't handed anything in games. Instead, I had to bust my ♥♥♥ to progress all of the time, and it was a great feeling to tell all of my friends on the playground about the strategy I had used. Now I find myself talking to friends that I handed my USB NES controller to on my couch. Learning the patterns was satisfying in a way that words can't truly explain. Quick doodles were made to explain how we handle the upcoming area, and we quickly found that Volgarr, while being a single-player game, was a great game for two people to pass a controller back and forth to.\n\nThis game has lovingly stuck a spear through my heart, and is easily in top contention for game of the year.\n","January 1, 2014","true","5.5"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

This game rewards persistence; the more you play and die, the more you learn about how to tackle certain obstacles. Learn from your mistakes! It's extreamly satisfying when you complete a level, something that many modern day games lack. You cannot button mash your way though this game, you need to think about each situation and work your way though it slowly (a little bit like Spelunky). Death is punishing as their is only 1 checkpoint per level, so take it slow and be cautious. The level design is great as are the monsters and the graphics will satisfy every pixel art fan. I highly recommend this game to anyone who appreciates a good platforming challenge. I cannot recommend this game to people who are new to platformers, or with bad timing/hand eye coordination.","August 30, 2014","true","16.0"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

This game is brutal and is in no way short on ways to punish every little mistake you make. If you want a game that's very true to Capcom's Ghosts 'n Goblins/Ghouls 'n Ghosts series, look no further than Volgarr The Viking.\n\nIt's a very intricate and meticulous platformer in almost every way. Stage designs and enemy layouts are all constructed and placed for the very specific purpose of you dying over and over again. There's a heavy-handed focus on memorization, and only nigh-perfect execution will see you through the many obstacles in Volgarr's path. This game doesn't play nice, and no victory in Volgarr is ever handed out. You'll have to think your way through each enemy or boss encounter and then execute that plan with nothing short of perfection. It can be intensely satisfying to crack open the game's stages and enemy encounters.\n\nThat said, frustration is very likely to set in at times due to the game's heavy reliance on memorization and perfect execution.  The only way out of any situation is usually the one the developers set up for you to figure out. While Volgarr himself has a lot of great tools at his disposal, it never feels like you're really free to use those tools in any way you want, which is a real shame. Additionally, attempting the "Path of the Valkyrie" route through the game is almost a task too herculean in nature for most to have the patience to ever see, which is a shame since it's the only way to access the alternate stages.\n\nVolgarr The Viking is a game made for someone wanting a very specific type of experience. Newcomers to this style of game may still find enjoyment through the frustration, but it's tuned much more for arcade junkies who don't mind a bit of repetition and tedium in their experience.","March 12, 2014","true","13.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

It had all the feelings of being a 2d fantasy sword-and-board platformer, where you can get into cool sword fights with skeletons, use magic, and do all kinds of cool moves.  Unfortunately, besides Battle of Olympus (eh...), there's not really any game that feels like Zelda II.  No game, that is, until Volgarr comes along, and shoves everything I love about Zelda II into one place, like being able to use your shield to block enemies, and using the down strike move.  I saw the trailers and some playthroughs of the first level, and I instantly fell in love.  Volgarr the Viking is the Zelda II I've been looking for.\n\nIt's not just those things that make Volgarr such a great game.  All you have is a sword for close range attacks, and a spear for long-ranged attacks, and using it against a wall will give you many platforming possibilities.  Throughout the game are treasure chests, and hitting them twice will give you an item that will power-up Volgarr with a piece of armor or weapon.  More stuff out of these chests means more hit defense on your character (up to 3 hits), and getting a flame sword means doing more damage to enemies, so the game rewards you for doing well.\n\nAnd trust me, you'll need every piece of armor you can get.  It may not look like it from all of the trailers and gameplay videos, but this game is hard.  Regardless of your gaming experience, you will die.  A lot.  This isn't Candyland the game.  This isn't Seseme Street: Count with the Count.  This isn't Diablo III.  You will die.  Not only that, but each stage has a checkpoint only half-way though the game.  That means if you die on a boss, you go all the way back to the half-way point and have to do the rest of the stage plus the boss.  Is it frustrating?  Yes.  Is it teeth-grindingly difficult?  Yes.  Is it rewarding?  YOU BET YOUR SECOND-BORN SON IT IS.  You get exploding treasure when you beat a boss!  If that's not rewarding enough for you, than you need to see an optometrist.\n\nThe way I see it, the game is not NES hard.  NES hard would be falling off a cliff because the game won't let you get a hit off of that supid bird.  NES hard would be getting knocked back and forth all over the place because the game thought it would be best to have 2 enemies side by side.  This is more SNES/Genesis hard, where it's tough as steel, but fair as a ref.  I see people play this game, and they get frustrated.  What's to be frustrated at?  It's not the game's fault you fell into those spikes: YOU jumped into them.  It's not the game's fault that you ran into those arrows: YOU didn't roll in time.  The game's fair but difficult challange gives me more of an incentive to complete it, because I feel like I'm not cheated when I play it.  I played the whole game.  I died a lot.  I never felt angry or frustrated the whole way through, becuase I knew the reason I keep dieing is because I didn't learn.\n\nIn video games, what kills you makes you stronger.\n\nTo conclude, I absolutely love this game.  It's the game I've been looking for for a long time.  I'm surprised people who are usually into hardcore games didn't this game a try.  This game has every bit of hardcore and more.  So, if you're into fun, fair, challenging platformers, give this a go.  The demo is a free download with barely any space holding it up, so what have you got to lose?\n\nThis game will kick your ♥♥♥, but not if you kick it first.","November 25, 2013","true","58.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","1"

If it's in the sense of playing the game over again, then I can tell you I am almost 100% positive once you complete this game fully you will never want to play it again, unless to show someone else or submit yourself to more torture. That being said, you are going to put so many hours into this game that it justifies the $12 price tag ten times over. You are going to die so many times that technically you can consider that your "replay value". If you beat the game and feel like it's not hard enough for you, then you can go back through the first level and not die. At all. Do not die, get to the end of the level, and defeat the boss. In one sweep. You will then exit off of the stage and be taken to a seperate set of levels that are called the "Path of the Valkyrie". These levels are much more challenging and give you all of the migraines you crave. Enjoy!\n\nReview Summary:\n\nNever have I played a game for four hours straight to still be on the first level.\n\nI am on the fourth level now and I have put 23 hours into this game.\n\nIt teaches you how to play by spanking you like a little school girl.\n\nYou will yell. You will cry. You will never laugh. You will step by step memorize enemy locations, level traps and upgrades to the point of madness...and then you'll continue to the next level and do it all over again.\n\nThere is one checkpoint in between each level, splitting them into two for each world. There are six worlds in total, making it twelve levels total. If you do not make it to the checkpoint then you will start at the very beginning upon death.There is a boss fight at the end of each world.\n\nYou have two weapons the entire game: a sword and a spear. Use these to navigate and decimate your way through each uniquely designed world. There are upgrades. If you can manage not to take any damage, each upgrade you get builds on top of the last one. It starts with a wooden shield, next upgrade is a metal shield and you can charge your spear throw. After that comes a viking helmet, then a flame sword. Only once you have claimed all of these upgrades can you truly claim you are still only mediocre at this game. There is also a bonus item you can find called Mjolnir, that gives you temporary invulnerability.\n\nBEWARE: This game instills hope just as fast as it takes it from you.\n\nIf that's not your cup of tea, then you are a sissy.","August 18, 2014","true","24.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

It's not impossibly hard, but it doesn't hold your hand at all.\nThe only thing that I find negative about this game, is how much of a difficulty curve it is to get the controls down. It can be really frustrating to be confused as to how to do things, but once you do figure it out, it's only uphill.\nMusic? Calm, but alright, and it certainly achieves a tone where you won't get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off but you'll definitely feel like a wimp once it stops from you dying.\nGraphics! Yes! I love the aesthetic! Very nicely animated, nothing feels too out of place and things that SHOULD pop out, DO pop out! (although it was a bit frustrating when a few things blended into the background but were hazards)\nGameplay/Game Design! THIS is where the game shines, Every level starts off with overwhelming information and danger, both of which you'll slowly learn over the course of your hundreds of deaths on each stage. After finally crafting a careful strategy as to how to get to the end of the level, you reach the bosses. At first they're not too hard, specially when you get their pattern down, but I can definitely not say the same about the later ones. These will test how quickly you can learn and adapt, because if you ♥♥♥♥ up now, it's allllllll the way back.\nAgain, a GREAT challenge, where knowledge and skill are both HEAVILY needed. Then there's different endings, but screw those amirite.\n9/10: Fantastic, but VERY little away from being perfect.

Volgarr takes the best parts of classics like Altered Beast and Ghosts n' Goblins/Super Ghouls n' Ghosts and turns them into something unique, impressive, and refreshing in a sea of sub-par retro games. The art style is also great. Even the death animation is badass... which is good because you're going to see it a lot.\n\nVolgarr is FairEach level has 1 checkpoint and a boss. Throughout each stage you'll find a series of chests (many are hidden) that give you a power up (sturdy shield, helmet, flame sword, etc.). Getting hit means you lose 1 or more powerups, so if you want to beat the boss you're going to have to get through the level with your 'A-game'. You don't have lives in this game, and you can keep playing until you give up or beat it, but there are no save-points. However, when you beat a boss, you can choose to skip that level when you start a new game. So if you've made it all the way to level 3 you can skip level 1 then 2 on your next session.\n\nVolgarr is for Non-Casuls OnlyThe platforming and combat in this game are excellent. I've seen complaints that jumping is difficult and movement is sluggish, but I say the controls are strict and predictable. You can double-jump, for example, and you can change your movement mid-air - so you need to be smart about when you press buttons. The enemies are varied throughout the game, and their attacks are also telegraphed and predictable - but don't let that fool you into thinking that makes them any easier to get past.\n\nVolgarr is... a Viking!I've had this game for quite awhile now and it's one of the few that I frequently come back to for 15-30min sessions. There are a couple levels I play more than others, but all the levels always present me with a challenge. I've only recently learned that if you righteously kick a levels ♥♥♥ you'll get a rare opportunity to play an alternate, hard-mode version of the following stage (So, at my game just got twice as big and I haven't even beaten the final boss yet).","March 18","true","17.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","2"

Almost every step is a challenge with death waiting around every corner. The game lives and thrives off of an old school feel and an incredible challenge that only the hardcore will be able to tackle. If you want a challenge, this game is for you. It looks and plays like a new school Rastan.\n\nThe graphics are amazing and there is an old school vibe to them. The world is detailed and looks fantastic. There aren't that many secrets in this world and you'll mostly be moving left to right with a few times that you'll go up or down. Vulgarr will also climb chains and vines, jump over arrows far quicker than you, ride boats, slide down slopes and jump over spikes. The enemies are big, detailed and deadly. There is a lot of enemy variety and you'll face off against waves of lizard men, giant snakes, spore spitting plants, giant spiders that wait for you to come to them before they spring into action, zombies that split in half if you attack their lower half causing the top half to tumble forward, shielded skeletons that will jump and downthrust at you and so much more. These enemies are probably the best designed enemies I've seen in years. Almost all of the enemies and areas are a homage to games like Rastan, Castlevania and Zelda 2.\n\nThe controls are simple and could have been done with an original Nintendo controller, but there is some depth, left and right to move, down to duck, attack with a sword, and jump (double jump that works as a screw attack). You can roll under things by holding down and the jump button. You can duck attack, jump and down thrust to break through floor tiles and enemies. You can also throw a spear by pressing up. The spear is not only a long range weapon, but a way to create platforms. You can also hold up to charge the spear and throw it across the screen to impale several enemies at once.\n\nAs Vulgarr you are slow and deliberate like the original Castlevania. You need to time attacks, and know where to stand in certain situations. You will need to kill or be killed rather than dodge enemies. Most enemies can be dispatched with a single swing of your viking sword, but Vulgarr is just as fragile as most of the enemies. One hit will result in death. You can break open treasure chests to find upgrades, first the wooden shield, then the helmet & iron shield, then the flame sword. All of these upgrades that allow you to take an extra hit that will lose a piece of armor. So if you have a flame sword and get hit, you will not only lose the flame sword but your helmet. When you have the shield, you can block attacks by not attacking. Then it becomes a case of knowing when not to attack. However, wooden shields break after taking so much damage. There are other secret power ups that you will find by breaking through walls and floors ala Castlevania.\n\nThe game is painfully difficult with long challenges between check points. At least the game offers unlimited lives. There are tricky jumps that rely on knowing where to throw your spears. Finding where to stand might result in playing the same level over and over countless times. Doing the exact same thing over and over with no real deviation to what you just did your previous life. Eventually, you will remember what to do, where to stand for specific enemies and you'll get better like all murderous old school games.\n\nThis game has a lot going for it, but because this is a painfully challenging game, I can't recommend it to players. But judging from the downvotes. I'm wrong and people love difficult games.","August 28, 2014","false","11.3"," 98 of 187 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","98","187","0","10"

It’s a colorful game with tight controls and well-designed levels, most of which are broken into two areas with a challenging boss waiting at the end of each. Unlike many modern games that allow progression with minimal commitment from players, it has an unabashed difficulty that demands the player master enemy patterns, learn ambush locations, and find secret power-ups. People looking for a challenge akin to what you may find in a Souls game will find a lot to like about Volgarr the Viking. It’s highly recommended that you use a controller for this game.","June 24, 2014","true","17.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Or die trying, a lot! Having actually finished this game I feel qualified to recommend it to anyone who likes extremely difficult platformers. Volgarr is something of an anomaly, a game that could have been made back in 1990, but works so very well today. It is not the same kind of fast paced action featured in games like Super Meat Boy, though. It is slower, more deliberate, and much more violent. Every movement must be deliberate and you will die a lot just figuring out when to jump, what the boss pattern is, etc... However, you do get unlimited lives and the most you have to backtrack is maybe 5-7 minutes after dying to a boss, if that. If this doesn't sound like fun to you, it might not be, but it feels great once you've mastered the levels and bosses, eventually being able to clear them without even getting hit once. Oh, and you do get armor pickups that enhance your abilities and you can take 2-3 hits before dying depending on your items, and can block most ranged attacks. The game is very fair, just very hard.\n\nThere is a lot more to the game than most people will ever see, as well. By completing levels perfectly (or near perfectly) you gain "lives" you can use in extra-challenging alternate levels. There are 4 or 5 of these, and when you run out of lives in them you get dropped back into the main game levels, at which point you can try to win them without getting hurt again and get back into the alternates. There are 3 different endings based on how many of these you complete.\n\nI'll wrap up with a quick tip for anyone who buys the game and wants to actually finish it... Press left on the title screen to warp to the next level. You can keep doing  this all the way to the end game tower assuming you actually beat the boss of the level you're skipping over.","December 8, 2013","true","17.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Kudos must be given to the developpers for creating a game that is very impressive in many respects. I have no criticism to offer when it comes to the presentation, ergonomy, core gameplay or level design. This is 2D action platforming at its finest. A great homage to Rastan, Ghouls & Ghosts, and many more.\n\nHowever the devs have made the conscious decision to include almost zero checkpoints. There is one checkpoint mid level, and that is that. No checkpoint before bosses either. Since this is very much a try & die game, with long & challenging levels, the result is that you will be replaying the same sections, over and over, and over and over, until you are sick to death of them. One mistake can & will set you back 5 minutes or more. This will happen many, many times. This is basically balanced for NG+ from the get-go / for people who already know the levels by heart. The joy of discovery & the fun of the challenge offered are completely ruined by the sheer numbness of repetition.\n\nThis is a common complaint & one that the developpers have chosen to ignore - instead writing a impossibly long faq, listing reasons/excuses why they would not. These range from "the game can be completed in 20 minutes" ( sure, in a speedrun world record ) to "git gud". The kind of arrogant attitude one expects to see from young players, not professionals. It is worth noting mosts requests are most not about making the game easier. The difficulty is part of the experience, and is much appreciated. The only common request is to have a decent number of checkpoints. Not excessive, simply decent. One or two more per level is all it would have taken - at least for the first playthrough.\n\nIf you value your leisure time, I regret to say, the right move is to avoid this one.","February 20","false","1.9"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","10","17","0","0"

HELL NO!\nThis game is truly amazing, takes many good things of old classic arcade games and adapt them to new styles of gameplay.\n\nThe mechanics of the game are really similar to Ghost'n'Goblins. While you progress you find chests with items inside, if you get hit you'll loose 1 or 2 items.\nYou can get the items only in a specific order:\n-Shield  (you start with it but you can lose it, it can parry a few hits) ;\n-HammerShield  (can parry every hit, unlocks the power to charge super spears);\n-Helmet  (i havent found any specific ability for this, it just grand another layer of defence);\n-Flame Sword  (deals increased damage).\n\nOverall the difficulty could feel a bit frustrating at the beginning, especially if you're used to save your game every few steps.\nIt's gonna be brutal, you'll die a lot, but each time you'll learn a bit more about the level and slowly you'll progress and be able to finish a level without dying.\nIt is really hard, like the old Rastan and Ghost'n'Goblins were, it took me roughly 1 hour to complete the first world, which is divided in 2 levels + boss.\nOverall i love it, it brings me back to when i was a kid and couldn't wait to go to the Arcade and spend tons of coins to play these beautiful games.

Then buy this. Don't know what they were about? Read on.\n\nChallenge\nIf you're looking for a game that will hold your hand or provide a lot of guidance, then don't buy this game. Save for showing you the controls at the start and showing a few hints, you have to figure out everything for yourself. The checkpoints are spaced out quite a bit, especially compared to most modern games. Don't expect checkpoints right before the bosses.\nOn the other hand, the levels are short, so once you get the hang of them, getting back to the boss won't take much of your time. Breezing through a level that made you grunt and curse like a viking initially is a clear indication of real progress, not just haphazardly making it to the next checkpoint.\nYou're expected to find safe routes through the environment, and solid tactics for defeating your enemies.\n\nEnemy variety\nAt the start of each world you'll encounter a new set of enemies, and you'll often see new ones in the second part of the world as well. While some enemies are very similar in appearance (not just palette swaps, though), their moves and properties will differ. The bosses vary greatly in appearance and attack patterns.\n\nLevels\nThe levels must be attempted in a linear order, though you can choose a harder version of the next world after defeating a boss, provided you're able to loot enough chests without getting hit. You can sometimes choose more difficult paths within levels, which often lead to chests or secrets.\nThere aren't any blind leaps of faith, provided you use the "look ahead" button, though it comes close at times. You can spot hazards by carefully observing the level.\nThe levels have distinc looks and the hazards change as well.\n\nConclusion\nIf you think a 2D action platformer which will punish you for your mistakes sounds like fun, then buy this game.\n\nEdit: Formatting","June 24, 2014","true","25.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This one from Crazy Viking Studios reminds me of the NES version of Dragons Lair, not so much the gameplay but the almost impossibility of completing the first level. Very unforgiving Volgarr The Viking has one difficulty setting, and thats Ralph Wiggum HARD. This is one of those games where what you see is what you get, and reminds me a lot of a SEGA arcade machine that would cost you 25 cents every run. So trust me, if that were the case with this game, you would lose your entire paycheck trying to beat the first level. BUT, that isn’t exactly a bad thing, and I’ll explain why.\n\nWhen I initially started this game, the powerful music combined with the 16 bit SEGA graphics kind of takes you back a bit. I like games with unique introductions like this one, where the start screen is the beginning of the game as well. Volgarr the Viking takes elements from games like Castlevania and Contra, and brings them into the new age while making sure not to jeopardize the retro feel. Not only is this game more brutally violent than a relationship with Chris Brown, but brutally hard. My first time playing after 30 minutes and multiple deaths I still hadn’t made it to the first checkpoint. One of my main concerns reading the early reviews of this game revolved around what many called “clunky, unresponsive controls.” Thankfully after buying Volgarr I found this not to be the case. The dynamics and mechanics are perfectly balanced for this game, and are what I would like to describe as “solid.” Meaning each move must follow through before making the next, so if in the time you are swinging the sword you are hit, you won’t be able to react fast enough and will suffer the consequences.\n\nThe Game itself doesn’t have much of a story line. When you first start, the Gods declare “Rise Warrior!” as a bolt of lightning strikes the ground Volgarr appears. From there on you start the game immediately and begin the adventure. Starting off you are given a shield, which will act as your main form of defense against the lizardish bird monsters that you are put up against. When you aren’t attacking you are able to block the simple attack so each of the monsters, but the moment you attack you are leaving yourself vulnerable. The shield acts as a hit point. If you get hit, you lose the shield and you are now exposed to everything making your next hit fatal. You can pick up different forms of armor throughout the game by finding and breaking open chests. After getting the shield and helmet you can upgrade your weapon to a flaming sword which is considerably more powerful than the one you begin with. Each different item you are wearing acts as single hit point, each time you are hit you lose an item.\n\nAs for replay factor, that seems to be all that you will be doing when it comes to Volgarr The Viking, or at least that was my experience. I can say that I have played the game for a good 5 hours in preparation for this review, and within that time I’ve learned to love and hate the game all at the same time. It certainly is hard, and seems impossible, but I guess thats what gives it mystery. The way I look at it, Volgarr The Viking is yet another classic from Adult Swim Studios, and no matter what you love or hate about it, thats what makes it so awesome.\n\nVolgarr The Viking stays true to the 16 bit retro feel all the way through. Everything from the controls, graphics, music and mood all remind me of after school gaming sessions with friends, trying to prove who could get further and beat the level. Taking everything into account Volgarr The Viking is a good game, fun to play, and bleeds nostalgia. If you think you have what it takes, go for it, you won’t be disappointed.\n\nGraphics: 7/10\nPlayability: 6/10\nStory: 1/10\nChallenge: 10/10\nReplay Value: 6/10","November 27, 2013","true","1.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Volgarr isn't as difficult as these, but it certainly owes its existence to Ghosts N' Goblins and fans of that title and fans of punishing old school games should love homage to the "Golden Age" of arcade gaming.\n\nVolgarr features hand-made pixel animation, epic soundtrack, simple controls and of course...challenging level design.  It isn't a looker, but it doesn't need to be.  Each level never changes, so when you die you will know what is coming and must try and improve for your next attempt.  This meticulous design offers a highly rewarding feeling of accomplishment when you finally overcome a level that has been making you tear your hair out for the last 40 attempts.  This is what the game is all about.  If you hate dying, hate a challenge, need a story and dislike repetition then you must steer clear of this title.  Otherwise, you will be able to flex your gaming muscles and really challenge yourself.\n\nThere isn't a lot else to say.  It is a well designed homage to an older generation of games and will instantly appeal to fans of the NES platformer era.  The game is never unfair, so if you are apprehensive about picking this up, at least look for it on sale and give it a chance.\n\n","April 7, 2015","true","15.2"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

The controls are smooth, and the irreversibility of jump directions and such give the game a bit of an original-Castlevania-esque feel, where you have to plan your moves a little more carefully. However, the level layouts are completely static, save for some weak-enemy spawn points. You have unlimited lives, but lose a little gold each time you die.

When you first start a stage, move immediately to the left to skip that world.\n\nThe platforming mechanics are solid, which is what you want in a platformer. You can –with timed double jumps– be precise with your movement once you learn how. The enemies are ok, including bosses none of them have random elements from what I can tell, so you can plan everything before you jump into a fight once you've learned the patterns. This is a good thing for speed running, but it makes the game feel sanitary sometimes. The game usually shows you a new enemy or trap relatively safely before including it in the rest of the level too, which is nice. The graphics are pretty much what you'd see on a SNES or Sega Genesis/Mega Drive, which better suits this style of game in my opinion.\n\nOverall I'd give it an 8/10, not the best platformer ever, but it's the best one I've played in a long time. There is also a hard version for all (but the first?) worlds, which is explained to you in the credits if you hadn't figured it out already.

The graphics are a little odd- they look kind of like a SNES game with the "filtering" turned on to make the pixels look smoothed, but I actually do like them. More importantly, the mechanics are top notch. With these kind of games, controls and mechanics absolutely make or break the game. Volgarr has Rastan style swordplay (attack while moving, block with shield, etc) and Ghouls 'N Ghosts style platforming (a nice, crisp-feeling double jump) and powerups (chests upgrade your shield/armor/weapon depending on what you've got currently, allowing you to use new moves and take more hits).\n\nVolgarr has a sword and a spear, and that's it. The game really makes it work, giving you a range of options. You can fight while moving, play defensive and trade blows with your shield, dodge roll, jump attack, downstab, throw spears, charge spear attack, throw spears in midair, throw spears into walls to make new platforms, and so on. All of this is highly intuitive and you'll find yourself doing some really cool maneuvers very naturally. I kind of amazed myself just now when I jumped into an area, threw a spear in midair to kill a wasp, downstabbed to kill a lizardman, dodge rolled past an arrow trap, and then jumped onto a spear I threw earlier to climb out of the pit before another arrow could fire.\n\nIt's important to know that Volgarr is very oldschool. That means no saving. Every time you launch the game, there isn't even a start menu, Volgarr is borne out of blood and bone and you start killing lizardmen immediately. You begin from level 1 every time you launch the game. You do have infinite lives, but checkpoints aren't highly frequent, and you'll need to beat the game in one sitting. I believe that beating a level without dying takes you down an alternate path for the next level, and beating the entire game without dying gives you a secret ending.\n\nMy only complaint is that I wish that the game had better music.

The spear's simple/easy to use, and is necessary for traversal. The games core is its difficulty. It is very hard to get from checkpoint to checkpoint, but when you do progress the sense of achievement is genuine. It never feels like the obstacles are impossible or cheap.

Völgarr is a bloody plateformer with stunning animations and more importantly, extremely accurate controls. Of course, this is a very difficult game, with almost no checkpoints, and you will die a lot before successfully finish a level, and even more to see the real end which requires fulfillment in a single run. For the more competitive gamers, Völgarr also offers speedrun with a built-in stopwatch. Gentlemen, your records!\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\nJe recommande fortement ce jeu qui est une véritable ôde aux vieux jeux d'arcade. Völgarr est un plateformer sanglant doté de superbes animations et, plus important, de contrôles extrêmement précis. Bien sûr, c'est un jeu difficile, avec presque aucun checkpoints, et vous mourrez beaucoup avant de finir un niveau, et plus encore pour voir la vraie fin qui demande de finir le jeu d'une traite. Pour les plus acharnés, Völgarr propose aussi du speedrun avec un chronomètre intégré.

The classic days of old-school gaming had artificial difficulty to ensure that gamers never finished a game too fast. Recently, the trend has been to make gaming accessible so that more people actually get to the conclusion instead of simply throwing things at the players to test their mettle.\n\nVolgarr the Viking is not that type of game. While there are certainly plenty of enemies, the game doesn't revel in being cheap. Some of the pitfalls may be unfairly placed, but the game constantly asks you to utilize your entire moveset to get the best of the environments.\n\nWhile combat plays a decently big part of the experience, the game is mostly focused on the platforming. Learning how to maneuvere between projectiles and death traps will play a big part of your journey with Volgarr. That and getting hit is pretty damn deadly as you can only ever attain three hit points.\n\nIt makes for a game that starts with a near vertical cliff face for a learning curve. The first level is easily the hardest part of the game, with the second level coming in pretty close. You aren't yet acquainted with the combat or very deliberate feel of your character, so you tend to die on the simplest of things.\n\nI wanted to smack anyone who said the game was "fair," at first. Then, as I kept playing, I realized that most of the difficulty stems from how impatient one can get. You really need to analyze what is coming at you and perform on the drop of a dime. It's not for the faint of heart, but it's definitely very rewarding.\n\nI am still torn on how Volgarr moves. The game is fashioned after Monster Hunter or Demon's Souls in that every action has specific frames that cannot be cancelled out of. It can lead to some controller throwing fits, but learning to not repeat mistakes is the best way to overcome the obstacles in your path.\n\nThe levels are pretty well built and there is even a hidden path that leads to a harder challenge. Since I suck, I didn't proceed that way, but I'm inclined to give it a shot. Even with the design being solid, the game eventually gets easy. The final boss for Ending C is a god damned joke, which is a bit upsetting.\n\nI also wasn't terribly fond of the music and default camera style. The game is zoomed in and it makes every 10 times harder. The graphics don't even look that great with the default style, so I'm not sure why that was chosen. If you toggle the zoom, the game becomes a little bit easier to deal with, in addition to making the sprite work shine.\n\nWhile I was initially going to say skip this unless you're hardcore or dedicated, I actually think that would be doing a disservice to the game. It's well made, despite some frustrations I have with it. Most of my issues are my own, though the lessening of challenge towards the end does kind of suck.\n\nI also don't really see myself returning to this in the future, but in the present, I'm a bit hooked. It's a really fun game and that is what matters most. It's cheap (can be cheaper on a Steam sale) and it won't be a breeze to get through.

Gameplay and Story get a rating scale from 1 to 10, and the AV stuff gets a rating from 1 to 5. My philosophy on this is that there are some instances in which a game may not necessarily have that much in the way of gameplay (take Amnesia for example), but the story/atmosphere/whatever it may be is reason enough to pick it up. Also, take the cumulative score with a grain of salt; it's just a numerical feeling about the game as a whole. That's part of why I do these subscores. Also, keep in mind that I'm not going off of school grade based rankings. A 5/10 denotes what I feel to be an average game. Likewise, 7/10 is a game that I think is pretty cool, and something that gets a 2/10 is near-abomination level. Pinning scores to an even further obfuscated rating scale is kinda senseless, but for the sake of my backloggery, I'll repeat again that 1.0-2.7 is a one-star game, 3.0-4.7 is a two-star game, 5.0-6.7, 7.0-8.7, and 9.0-10 are three, four, and five stars, respectively.\n\nGameplay: Man, Adult Swim Games sure have been publishing some pretty great titles. I think this one is top of the pile, though. The fact that this game doesn't have a Wikipedia page as of the time of writing is a great injustice to just how good this game is. In fact, a friend of mine named this game his Game of the Year for 2013. After playing through the game myself, I can certainly see why he'd say this. One phrase he used to describe this game is "a 2D Dark Souls." While the best phrase to describe this game is a "newer Ghouls 'n' Ghosts game;" in fact the studio's vision for this game, that can conjure up negative ideas about the game's design and how it handles difficulty. For now, just think of it as a 2D Dark Souls.\n\nAfter some retrospection, I found that my first playthrough of this game was auspiciously similar to my first playthrough of Dark Souls. In both games, I was never too sure of the control scheme at first, but once I got used to it (and in this case, stopped using the analog stick in favor of the D-Pad (no seriously, the D-Pad on any controller beats the analog stick for this game)), I found that the control scheme worked perfectly for the game. Combat, much like Dark Souls, is very accurate and weighty. Likewise, this game has some excellent hitboxes; in fact, sometimes a bit too excellent. That's not a criticism, though; just know that you can get beaned in the head with an arrow even if your shield is extended, since your shield doesn't cover your head.\n\nAnother comparison to Dark Souls is the fact that this game does the most vital thing in a difficult video game (in my opinion), and that's signaling. You can do whatever you want to enhance the challenge of a level, as long as there's proper signaling. Again, the comparison between this and Dark Souls arises; both games were excellent at signaling, meaning that there were never any cheap deaths. Stages are surmountable without any memorization necessary, although if you're kinda dumb like me when it comes to video games, some memorization may be necessary. Plus, this game does that magical thing where you just get better at stages. That's a true sign of a well designed challenge level; where you can come back later on and find it easier without needing memorization. Overall, this game is a masterpiece in challenge level and level design.\n\nIn fact, my only real gripe is how this game handles bosses. Each stage is broken up into two halves - much like Ghouls 'n' Ghosts - with a boss at the end of the second half. This is a thing that I've thought about for a while now, and I think it may just be an unfortunate necessity due to how the game handles health (you get bits of armor and weapon upgrades from chests throughout the level and lose them if you're hit; again, pretty much exactly like Ghouls 'n' Ghosts). Either that, or it may be a bit more rigid conformity to the Ghouls 'n' Ghosts design ethos. The bosses themselves are fairly easy and incredibly patternated, so once you get the pattern down, you should have no problems with the bosses. This may just be me injecting my personal design sensibilties, but I feel like the bosses could've been a lot better if there was a checkpoint beforehand (along with making the bosses harder overall, of course).\n\nAgain, though; this isn't too big of an issue, but it is one that I thought could've been handled in a bit different (and in my opinion better, but you've figured that out already) manner. Nevertheless, I can definitely see why this was my friend's Game of the Year for 2013. While I can't necessarily make a statement about 2013 with regards to games, since I just started PC gaming in October 2013, if it had came out this year, it would most certainly be Game of the Year for 2014 for me. Yes, that means beating out Dark Souls II. 10/10.\n\nStory: Literally the only story you get is a credits scroll at the end. Not even gonna rate.\n\nGraphics: Man, there's some pretty great looking art in this game. The graphics feel like an "HD Genesis/Mega Drive game," which once again fits perfectly with the Ghouls 'n' Ghosts inspiration. All of the enemy designs are great, there's detail practically oozing out of every pixel laid down, and it still looks great at 1080p. My only gripe with enemy designs are the bosses of level 2 and level 5. They're literally reskins of enemies in the area. All the other bosses are unique designs, but boss 2 and 5 are somewhat disappointing. That's not too big of a deal, though; the core enemy design is great anyways. Of course the game runs well, so there's no worry about not being able to run it. Even though it windows at a relatively low resolution, it fullscreens to match your resolution of choice without a hassle. 5/5.\n\nSound: I've found that I like a lot of brass and percussion in my orchestration. This game... delivers a LOT of brass and percussion. This makes sense, of course; we're a viking, after all. We don't want a panflute chronicling our journey; no, we want big, bombastic horns, tubas, timpanis... the whole nine yards. Suffice to say, the music in this game is good. Really good. So good that I grabbed the OST literal minutes after I completed the game. There's no voiceacting in this game, so I don't really need to worry about that. I think it's pretty obvious that a 5/5 is in order for this game's sound department.\n\nOverall scores are 10/0/5/5; cumulative score of 10/10. Yeah, this is Game of the Year material. You should probably buy this game before a viking busts down your door and impales you with a flaming spear of awesomeness.","June 11, 2014","true","8.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Simplistic as can be in terms of gameplay, though that is not to say that learning how to control Volgarr is not an obstacle with a nice skill ceiling. Some may consider his controls rather rigid, but if you learn how to use him, he's fluid and most importantly, much like Ghouls and Ghosts, very fair. Remember guys, sometimes you have to jump back a bit before you jump forward to get to where you want to go -- little ghouls and ghosts tip for those not used to this jumping system.\n\nFrom a level design perspective, I personally quite enjoy both paths of the game. However, I think overall the Valkyrie path has superior level design. The crystal path suffers a bit from too many enemies and not enough platforming, but, that may be your thing. Enemies are in and of themselves obstacles, but the game is at it's best when you have to manage both at the same time. So learn to Volgarr well and experience the bliss of the Valkyrie path.\n\nThe soundtrack is pretty good, but not good enough to warrant listening to it beyond your 50th hour of playing -- though I think most won't play it that much, so you're fine!\n\nFrom a replayability perspective, the game doesn't offer much variety once you complete both paths. There are no alternative ways to play, so, once you've beat it, you can either stop there, or grit your teeth and become the best Volgarr player you can be. As a speedgame, Volgarr is simple, but very skillful and both a joy to play and to watch. It may not look particularly "fast", but, trust me, there's always time to save. So if speedrunning is your thing, by all means pick it up and grace the leaderboard -- please, I seriously wish more people ran this game.\n\nRISE WARRIOR!\n\n--\n\nFrom a guy who has too many hours in this game, with only many more to come. (And, I should note, I have the GoG version of this game as well, so... there's more time devoted to this than just what steam wants to tell you.)","January 7, 2015","true","107.9"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","1"

Neither one saved my progress, so next time I'd go to play, I'd have to start at Level 1. What am I doing wrong here? I understand Volgarr is supposed to be difficult (which it is), but shouldn't I be able to see just HOW difficult it is by being able to get past the first 2 levels? I mean, how about some mid-level checkpoints? And how about a world map where I can pick and choose levels that I've already beaten (should that ever happen), and not some bland, "follow the yellow brick road" system.\n\nAnd what all cool upgrades for Volgarr lie beyond Level 2? I looked it up. Additional weapons? Nope. More armor? Nope. Wielding the Fire Sword for more than 5 seconds before getting hit and losing it? Hopefully. Furthermore, why does getting hit while wielding said Fire Sword also cause me to also lose my helmet? That's TWO pieces of equipment lost from ONE hit! The upgrade/armor/health system reflects that of Super Mario Bros., but Volgarr's first two levels aren't nearly supplied with as many treasure chests (where upgrades are found) as Mario's first two levels were with question mark blocks, and some of Mario's blocks had stars.\n\nAlso, when you slaughter enemies they will sometimes drop treasure, which is used for leaderboards. That's cool, but I find it hard to focus on killing every single Lizardman, hoping they drop treasure, just to top the leaderboards when I'm trying to survive until the next treasure chest. Perhaps with all this treasure to collect, a Sonic-type health system would've made sense.\n\nHowever, the controls are simple, the graphics are nice and accurately reflect the retro aethestic of its SNES counterparts, and the triumphant battle themes remind me of the good old days of splurging quarters on Gauntlet Legends.\n\nI REALLY wanted to like this game, and [adult swim] is an entertainment brand I trust. The trailers make Volgarr look like a fun challenge, not a frustrating chore. Until some issues are addressed, I cannot fully recommend this game.\n\nTL;DR:  Gee, I can't wait to get to Level 3.","December 20, 2014","false","7.3"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","8","15","2","0"

The only problem I have with challenging games in this instance is the very nature of the challenge: trial and error. This is by no means old school platforming, merely a modern take on platforming where fun is replaced with frustration and called a challenge. For an old school game, I have played it about as much as I need to in order to assess what I love and and hate about it.\n\nI love the graphics and the sound, which are top notch, old school throwbacks. The graphics are detailed and thoroughly eye-opening, especially when you're swinging around the fire sword. The sounds that compliment it are simple, catchy tunes with very little in the way of complexity, again allowing you into the world of Volgarr easily and without much trying.\n\nWhat I hate about this game is the absurd view the developers have of what makes a game challenging. Forcing a player back to the beginning of the level, then making them get back to where they died, travel an extra few feet and die to something else they couldn't possibly anticipate, is frankly insulting. I lost my cool with the first level because the enemies that spawned did so differently from death to death, making my learning of the level impossible. When I finally did get through a difficult wave of enemies and pratfalls, I was faced with an arrow trap that just shot me in the face without me even having time to move out of the way. I dislike games that do away with fun and Volgarr certainly did for me.\n\nFor those of you who have the tolerance to sit through death after death, this is a game for you (especially for dark souls players), but if you enjoy a really good platformer, buy some of the mega drive classics and fusion games like risk of rain to get the best out of your money. Volgarr would have been superb if it was anything like the classics it was trying so hard to emulate. Ghouls and ghosts for the new generation?

The game becomes difficult not due to actual challenge, but due to level flow. Enemies are as close to a "bullet hell" game as a "mostly" ground-pounder game can be, but when you have to stop the flow of action to line up a jump properly due to poor level design it's very immersion breaking. Overlooking that, it strives for "Nintendo Hard" but is more a systematic issue with the stilted nature of the control scheme that provides the real challenge. Whereas the enemies themselves are reasonably predictable, and it's usually the inability to respond that kills you and not the challenge presented by the enemies. With an improvement in the controls and a smoother level design, it could be great, but having recently played many other platfomers, the sluggish combat animations and stuttering jumping sequences really stick out in an otherwise "nostalgic" platformer.","January 4, 2015","false","0.3"," 12 of 23 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","12","23","0","0"

It's not difficult because the game has good AI, or because enemies are unpredictable.\n\nIt's difficult because we're not used to this kind of games, and after dying 20 times and reaching the second checkpoint full geared you realize that it's not challenging, it's boring, plain and simple.\n\nIf you like to memorize patterns and play for hours without really any kind of motivation except to complete a game so you can tell your friends "hey, u know what? I finished volgarr the viking, i'm such a pro player", then this game is for you.\n\nIf you're looking for a game with a story, with good IA, or with a real challenge that goes beyond dying and repeating the same thing over and over, then this is not for you.","January 6, 2015","false","0.5"," 44 of 87 people (51%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","51","44","87","0","8"

The checkpoint system - or its near absence - makes you go back to the beggining of the stage each time you die. The challenge lies mostly in fixed patterns, so running the same section over and over to master it is necessary. Air control seems lacking, making even the easiest jumps a potential death trap.  Moreover, the game is short - only 7 levels, if you count in the one awarded to a player beating the hardmode. So many flaws in one game.\n\nYou know what? It creates a perfect sidescrolling action game.\n\nVolgarr gives you a challenge to beat the game, and does not care if it's too hard for you. Every time you die near the end of a section knowing that you have to spend next 10 minutes redoing the stage, the game gives you a choice of just quitting it. And you don't, because it has just made it personal. Every time you die to a boss you feel like you should give up - but Volgarr motivates you to just try harder and do better next time. And when you finally beat the stage - I've never played a game that gave me so much satisfaction after that. The game is never unfair. You have a level to complete, that's all. All you can do is to master the controls of the viking and learn the weaknesses of you enemies.\n\nThe graphics are great. Volgarr looks like a real badass viking, equipping more and more awesome armor and weapons at every step. The effects of his flame sword attacks are just glorious. The audio is stunning, providing you with top-class effects during combat and amazing sounds congratulating you on completing the challenges. Also, this is the only title with credit screen so good that I don't even think about skipping it at the end of the game. I won't spoil the fun, experience it for yourself.\n\nIf you seek for a nice, fair challenge, get Volgarr. If you are an old-time gamer of NES era and want to relive some of the spirit of Castlevania and Ninja Gaiten, get Volgarr. If you are tired of games that hold your hand at every second, get Volgarr. If you want to play a great game, get Volgarr.\n\nAnd good luck.","December 17, 2013","true","36.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

If you would like a short and blunt summary of what this game is see the following video I did in my series for the final boss. This is the essence of the game once you strip away the fake difficulty, purposefully reimplemented arcade bugs and checkpoint starvation.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/w7IeweqEFL8\n\nIf you really want more than that here is the playlist for the series. Now without further ado here is the original review. My final impressions have not changed after completing the game.\n\n\nYou know. I had almost forgotten why I never really had any nostalgic feelings towards arcade games that inspired this one. What with their stiff controls, sparse checkpoints/continues for more efficient padding and quarter poaching, edge of screen spawning of enemies and other such fake difficulty. It's always nice to have a game come along and remind me. Funny thing is, the edge of screen spawning was actually technically justified at the time due to memory/sprite constraints and the state keeping issues that entailed. Now? Not so much.\n\nIf you want a real game that takes the pleasing challenge of arcades but doesn't rely on "but teh retro" as an excuse for its shortcomings check out something like They Bleed Pixels. That said though, be sure you look at the manual for this. They did a really great job on it making it look like how manuals used to look back when they were interesting and filled with lore (Zelda's manual being the most famous for example).\n\nOh and to answer the question a lot of people may have about this. No. There is no pre-boss checkpoints. You die and you have to do the whole level again. This isn't challenging, it's padding. Bad padding at that.\n\nAnyway, I noticed that the mouthbreather brigade was telling people that they didn't like it because it was challenging and they couldn't win (as well as calling people "kid" when their argument is called out, proving yet again that they're mostly kids themselves that don't have the slightest clue what these games were about and yet put on a facade of nostalgia), I decided to finish the first world (update: make that the entire game). I'm kind of glad too because it gave me more ammo in the form of this nonsense.\n\nI remember those games too. But you're  deluded if you think that you have the same ability to give these ultimatums that lazy companies who didn't want to do battery backups did in the 80s and 90s. Once again, this isn't challenging or a homage. It's a fundamental misunderstanding of the difference between features and technical workarounds.","January 14, 2015","false","13.2"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

While it tries to have a retro feel, it really doesn't. As one who played the old school games since Digger was the ♥♥♥♥, I would say that I can recognise a old school feel of platform gaming. And let me just say, I LOVE platform games. But this doesn't feel at all like one of the classics. In general it feels like a lazy unthought through failed attempt.\n\nThere are several major problems with the game. The first being the clumsy movements. Especially the jump movements are very badly made. It's quite easy to get into a position where you will need to jump to move on, but jumping in any direction will have a very high dead likeliness. There is simply a lack of fine manoeuvring witch make "precision" (and really, it didn't really have to be that precise) impossible. This has lead to many stupid deaths which didn't really reflect how hard the game is as much as it reflects a badly made game.\n\nBut perhaps the most annoying thing is how often you have to start from the beginning. The game has very accurately been described as a "trial and error" game and it is highly unlikely that you will finish the game in the first few attempts. This would be okay if it didn't mean that you had to restart the game from the very beginning almost every time. Meaning that you waste enormous amounts of time replaying parts that are no longer fun and that you have cleared to perfection dozen of times, just to get to the part you haven't played before. This is even to the point that when you close the game, you have to restart from the beginning again. In the old school platform games there was actually save options, something that isn't here. And in the games where there weren't save options, there was often the option of putting in a code that would bring you to a certain point in the game (a code you got for completing a level).\n\nA game is supposed to be fun and I do think that parts of this game is fun. BUT it is in no way fun having to replay the same part for the million time! That is just stupid, a waste of time and a waste of money. So please, if you want a nice old school platform game, what about actually playing one of the old school games? Like Duke Nukem 1 and 2, Mario, Jazz Jackrabbit, Sonic, Realm of Terror, Pandemonium, Lost Vikings 1 and 2, Hocus Pocus or any of the other old classics. And have you already played al of these? Then there are many more, please comment if you want more suggestions :)\n\nBut please, don't reward laziness, false marketing and bad gameplay with you money. That will just push them to make more of this crap instead of actually getting their act together and making that good game they probably could if they worker a bit more serious.\n\nPS: By the way, there was always a story in the old games. This is also lacking here and another sign of the laziness behind the game.\n\nPPS: The setting is stupid. Seriously? Vikings in the steaming jungle filled with lizardmen? You do know that Vikings lived in northern Europe, right? Where it's cold or tempered, not steaming jungle? Ice warriors, something along the coast or anything like that, see that would be using the Viking name properly, not insulting it to sell a bad game.\n\nPPS: As one who actually grew up with the old school games, I have to say that none of them ever had this bad graphics... Almost every single game here on steam that tries to recreate the looks of the old 80s and 90s games, actually ends up making their games look a lot worse and more clumsy.","June 21, 2015","false","2.6"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

At first, I really liked the graphical pixel design as well as the soundtrack, mainly because it's very minimalistic but does not feel like some 8 Bit peeptone concert. Plus it is a game about a Viking, which I personally really enjoy hence there are not many Viking-themed games out there.\n\nBUT! The game is not just horrendously hard, it's unfair. Where games like Dark Souls give you enough time to explore and try some moves etc. here you have almost constantly enemies spawning from everywhere and you cannot see them because you range of view is quite small, therefore you often cannot react fast enough. Addicionally the feeling of the jumping mechanic is really outdated for a 2D sidescroller, meaning once you jumped you cannot change your direction exept you do a double jump. But even jumping onto a little block in your way will be pretty difficult because you jump to far. It's supposed to be like this because it used to be this way in the classical 2D sidescrolling era. But it doesn't make it automaticly a good thing. For me it just feels clunky, difficult to control and overall outdated.\n\nThe problem with the difficulty is that you simply have to memorize where and when enemys spawn and when to jump. When I want to play a game, difficult or not, I do NOT want to memorize everything! I just want the opporturnity to play through with my skill, not because I know that I have to jump in 3,4 seconds.\n\nToo bad this game equals difficult with unfairness, at least in my opinion. I get it, there are many gamers who want an expierience like in the classic 80's NES-era platformers, but in my opinion this just doesn't fit today as it did back in the day. Retro gaming in general can be very good and a lot of fun but memorizing whole levels is just a sign for bad leveldesign. It always has at least to be possible to play the game through all by your skill. Due to the design choices overall the game feels kinda dated.\n\nHence this game really doesn't cost much I still recommend to try it out for yourself and probably you will like it better than me.","October 23, 2015","false","0.6"," 13 of 27 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","13","27","0","0"

Volgarr himself plods along at a decent speed, but is flatly underequipped for most of what the game throws at him. The challenges are simple but Volgarr is simpler. You plod along, hopping about, dying a lot, learning the levels, and generally barely avoiding boredom because nothing in this game is done especially well.\n\nUntil...\n\nYou find the second game. As you repeat the levels over and over, you start to get a feel for what needs to be done. You'll brush up against that second game a few times before you finally realize what's going on. The levels are actually meticulously designed. If you move quickly, throw spears at the right times, and generally play the game as if you're speedrunning, the levels will come together. Every single stupid thing in the game becomes easily surmountable when you deal with it the second it comes on the screen. Enemies will line up perfectly to be killed with one spear, platforming will go by as quick as Volgarr's lumbering gait takes him...\n\nThis is the true Volgarr the Viking. It's not a platformer in the classic since, it's a trial and error speedrunner without the speed. Almost like a rhythm game at times only you can really only find out what the notes are and when by blindly stumbling over them and restarting anew. Since the game's final level can really only be unlocked by beating each level without getting hit and with finding the secret macguffin in each level, this really is what they intended for the game.\n\nIt's meticulously designed to foster perfect play while doing next to nothing to teach perfect play. Hell, the game barely teaches you the core mechanics except in one of those passive tutorials that people who watched that one MMX1 video are so fond of.\n\nThe problem is... it still doesn't make the game all that good. Any imperfect run just falls back into that first, really boring game (Only now with the knowledge that you are screwed out of anything satisfying knowing what you missed.), and high-end Volgarr play just does not satisfy enough to be worth the trial and error grinding to perfect each level.","January 1","false","2.4"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

Otherwise you're probably going to play for about an hour and then give up on it. I just feel like a game should be more rewarding than this. At least Ghosts N Goblins had cool spells you could unleash when you manage to grab a full set of powerups. Volgarr only manages to give you a triple damage spear with the first power up, and the final power up? A double damage sword. Not sure why the sword would end up being weaker than a powered up spear, but alright.\n\nAnother mechanic that's frustrating is the inclusion of all these nice golden items, gems, etc.. But, Sonic the Hedgehog fashion, you lose about 75% of your treasure when you die. I have no idea if you can use your gold to urchase upgrades between levels, but I very much doubt it. It just seems like a pointless and not-very-rewarding mechanic to me.\n\nAnother point of confusion is the checkpoints. On the first level you're given one after a very easy area. Then you're given one halfway through the level. You want one before the boss? Nah. Forget about it. There is, of course, a door that closes before you reach the boss. This seems like a mechanic borrowed from the Mega Man series, but makes no sense to have it here without a boss checkpoint. It would have made more sense if extra lives were involved, but instead you have unlimited continues and VERY few checkpoints. I would have preferred an Extra Lives system, having to restart an entire level when you run out of them, and more checkpoints.\n\nIt's not all bad though. The combat mechanics and the art style (aside from a few out-of-place goofy looking enemies, like the smiley 'Joker' snakes in Level 1)  are both mostly very cool. It's too bad most players won't get to see all the art the game has to offer.","March 30, 2015","false","2.6"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

The absurdity of that staggers me. I cannot think of a worse example of nonsensically exaggerated "Nintendo Hard" difficulty - a recent idea which is purely the product of people's dim memory of the past and laziness.\n\nYou can't blame this game's poor design choices on anything but the creators' inability to recognize and recreate the good aspects of something they sought to imitate. It's not "oldschool" to have ridiculously long stretches between checkpoints or rely on poor placement of annoying enemies to challenge the player, it's just plain bad. Try harder next time, guys.\n\nOn the positive side, the graphics and animation are fairly pleasing (if inconsistent) and combat is generally satisfying. I honestly want to praise this game just for aspiring to be like Rastan (which was long overdue for a proper tribute); but the more I play it, the more it infuriates me.

I wimped out and quit. But, I am one of those that feels it is "cheaply" or "artificially" difficult rather than a fun challenge of any sort. What ever helps me sleep at night I suppose!\n\nThis game is pure memorization with no forgiveness whatsoever. Perfection or bust. Each hit you take has a devastating affect on your chances of completing a level to the point you may as well reset rather than push on. And with fairly clunky controls this is a recipe for a nightmare. In particular I will whine about the jump mechanics. Sure its subjective but I found the jump control atrocious. I suppose I should say LACK of jump control. You jump straight up and down or a predetermined distance. Timing the double jump adds a hint of control but not enough. This is just one small factor in the overall issue; its a grinding unforgiving challenge, which is fine, BUT it just isn't fun during your punishment. I can enjoy a Super Meat Boy, or the like, that endlessly punishes you and makes you try something over and over. But I can't enjoy that beating if it isn't smooth and fun in the meantime. Put a little sugar on my beating.\n\nI forced myself to put in an effort for over an hour because of ego or some other stupid personality defect.

Volgarr is a fellow that looks more like a norse barbarian than a viking to me, his jumps are stiff and you're so badass that enemies take 1-3 hits (bosses not included) to kill. These said monsters keep coming up all the time so you better move since they won't run dry. The gameplay reminds a bit of old NES game Trojan in a not so positive way (oh the slow walking, oh the stifness of my actions).\n\nYou can hit, jump, point your sword downwards while jumping, do a sort of a double-jump by slashing in mid-air and throw a javelin that also works as a platform for you. You can't change direction or control the jumping much so better not spam it too much.\n\nThen the straight-up bs part:\nVolgarr attempts to  be hard. Real hard. IT sure is difficult but the difficulty comes from mistakes you make over and over again while playing the same part until you get it right and move to next nasty room. This TOO is usual, nothing too bad. BUT. Everytime I died I felt that "was that something I should've guessed?" or "if the controls were any better this could be easily done". Both of these could be dismissed as a bad player ranting but I've done my share of hard platformers like Ninja Gaiden, Battletoads, 100% completed Meat Boy and went through Spelunky without serious problems to name a few.\n\nWorst part is that the gameplay feels so clunky that I don't want to get accustomed to it.\n\nGood parts:\n-Window closes quite fast when quitting the game.","January 9, 2015","false","8.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

If you are a very masochistic person who enjoys being repeatedly violated over and over again, I could not recommend this game enough. Volgar the Viking will make you question your life decisions. The control is tight, the level design is compact and intuitive, the enemy design and placement is creative, and Volgar's abilites are interesing and unique. However, a specific mechanic in this game can be either very fun for you or make you want to just uninstall this game and never look back. The fact that you will have to die so many times to learn patterns of enemies, where the pitfals are, how to defeat a certain part. It is an exercise in trial and error. That maybe what you want. But if you are looking at this game as a 'small little challange' then be forwarned, "abandon all hope ye who enter here".","December 19, 2013","true","22.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","6"

Unforgiving and unrewarding. Really poor in both story and game design.\n-With a badass viking as the main character, the ambience could have been better, so the enemies and the combat effects.\n-No possibility to save your progress, and most of the time in order to know how to go thru an area, you have to know it previously, that means you have to die first, do all the level again up to that point and then continue.\n-You feel like you are struggling against the game, not the enemies, the enemies are quite simple in mechanics.\n\nI will never bother to finish this. I actually uninstalled it quite a while ago but im not as mad because it cost me almost nothing.

The human brain gets tired of the same stimulus over and over, so especially in this medium, you want to make sure you're constantly presenting the player with new concepts and ideas as time progresses. It's a matter of respecting the player's time, you see. Games like The Binding of Isaac always make you feel like you're getting something for your trouble, and the only reason Super Meat Boy gets away with being Super Meat Boy is because you respawn almost instantly, and the levels are so small to begin with. If you die, they don't make you start the whole world over. The brain trust behind this game didn't understand this.\n\nVolgarr the Viking is the worst, and not for the reasons its creators think it is. I'm bored out of my frigging skull playing this game, because my fault or not, I'm sick of doing the exact same thing over and over. Even games like Devil May Cry manage to be tolerable because the gameplay is so deep that mastering it is the reward in itself, but Volgarr can't even manage that. It feels like nothing worthwhile is waiting for me no matter how far I get, aside from having to put up with more intentionally awful knockback and jump mechanics that make the game far less enjoyable than it should be. Surprise: design concepts abandoned by the rest of the industry over a decade ago aren't relevant in the current landscape anymore. This game was outdated before it was even released, and contrary to popular belief, that's not a good thing.","July 5, 2015","false","3.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

I have Norse heritage, I love pixel art 2d graphics, and I love hardcore games.  So that being said why can i Just not get into this game.  It boiled down to 3 reasons in the level and game design choices.  1. Infinite spawning enemies that come out of no where. 2. No type of check point system (at least no part that I have been able to get to) 8( so I'm stuck on the first level......  No way to kill enemies when they are coming in from the rear and front simultaneously.  It seems with just a couple of updates and tweaks this game could have as much mass appeal as shovel knight aka sell alot more copies.  Oh well on to the next retro.","March 15, 2015","false","0.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It has a good feeling of nostalgia from the old games and a good soundtrack.\n\nThe bad thing is that its too much trial and error based, since there are traps / sequences that you won't be able to react for the first time (yes, no matter how good you are). That alone could still be ok, but the game has no checkpoints in the middle of each stage, so if you die at the boss cuz you haven't seen all of his patterns / sequences yet, you have to start from the beggining of the stage all over again and gets a bit boring to do that just to learn a few more patterns and repeat.\n\nIf the game is on sale and you have some time to spare, give it a try.

It is brutally difficult, and I have to say that it isn't to the game's credit.\n\nRetro gamers will be reminded of the game Rastan, in that in both games you control a barbarian-type character who attacks with a sword while (mostly) walking to the right. But whereas Rastan is a game that you can learn from, Volgarr the Viking isn't. This is mostly due to the fact that when you die, you go back to the last checkpoint, and checkpoints in this game are few and far between. Your character starts with a sword for his main attack, a spear for distance attacks and for climbing up walls, and a shield for defense, which can deflect some projectiles and that you lose after taking a single hit. If you're lucky, you can find a treasure chest that will first upgrade your shield (I have no idea what this does because you lose the upgraded shield after one hit -- it doesn't go back to the normal shield, mind you, it just goes away like the regular shield), then upgrade you to a helmet (that will take an additional hit, bringing your hit points up to two, after which you die), and a flaming sword that I presume increases your attacks (I don't know because I lost the flaming sword every single time after I got it on single-hit enemies).\n\nThe graphics are pleasant to look at in a 90s arcade sort of way, and the sound is certainly up to par with titles in that vein, but that's about all I can say in its favor.\n\nNow, I'm occasionally up for a side-scrolling platforming challenge: I've beaten Super The Empire Strikes Back on the SNES, every version of Bionic Commando on every system it was ever made for, Strider on the Sega Genesis and quite a few of the NES Mega Man games. Maybe it's my old age setting in, or maybe I'm just tired of developer B.S., but I'm really starting the hate the kind of cheap, artificial challenge some of these modern platformers are offering by making the game so unforgiving. I've played the game for about two hours, and I've only ever gotten to the second checkpoint (not even the end of the first stage, if there are more stages). Oh yeah, and you have to start the game from the beginning every single time you quit the game and restart, so you'd better get good at those first few areas. I was really looking forward to this game and now I'm just angry that I've purchased it.\n\nIf masochism and self-mutilation are your thing, then by all means: Go for it! Anyone who just wants to play a fun, challenging platform game can spend their money on Spelunky, Shovel Knight, Axiom Verge, or any of the dozens of other titles on Steam that are more rewarding, more forgiving, and certainly more fun.","November 7, 2015","false","1.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Theoretically, I should enjoy it because I have enjoyed the "trial and error makes for perfect runs" kind of gameplay presented by Super Meat Boy, Dustforce, and Trackmania. But I don't like Volgarr because, unlike the previously mentioned titles, Volgarr likes to be frustrating. The thing that killed it for me was the distance between checkpoints, but other things like the lack of control when jumping makes simple platforming frustrating to me. The way combat feels, the art style and animation quality, and the simple yet elegant gameplay make me want to like Volgarr, but I cannot get myself to enjoy it.","June 2, 2015","false","0.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It is brutally difficult, and I have to say that it isn't to the game's credit.\n\nRetro gamers will be reminded of the game Rastan, in that in both games you control a barbarian-type character who attacks with a sword while (mostly) walking to the right. But whereas Rastan is a game that you can learn from, Volgarr the Viking isn't. This is mostly due to the fact that when you die, you go back to the last checkpoint, and checkpoints in this game are few and far between. Your character starts with a sword for his main attack, a spear for distance attacks and for climbing up walls, and a shield for defense, which can deflect some projectiles and that you lose after taking a single hit. If you're lucky, you can find a treasure chest that will first upgrade your shield (I have no idea what this does because you lose the upgraded shield after one hit -- it doesn't go back to the normal shield, mind you, it just goes away like the regular shield), then upgrade you to a helmet (that will take an additional hit, bringing your hit points up to two, after which you die), and a flaming sword that I presume increases your attacks (I don't know because I lost the flaming sword every single time after I got it on single-hit enemies).\n\nThe graphics are pleasant to look at in a 90s arcade sort of way, and the sound is certainly up to par with titles in that vein, but that's about all I can say in its favor.\n\nNow, I'm occasionally up for a side-scrolling platforming challenge: I've beaten Super The Empire Strikes Back on the SNES, every version of Bionic Commando on every system it was ever made for, Strider on the Sega Genesis and quite a few of the NES Mega Man games. Maybe it's my old age setting in, or maybe I'm just tired of developer B.S., but I'm really starting the hate the kind of cheap, artificial challenge some of these modern platformers are offering by making the game so unforgiving. I've played the game for about two hours, and I've only ever gotten to the second checkpoint (not even the end of the first stage, if there are more stages). Oh yeah, and you have to start the game from the beginning every single time you quit the game and restart, so you'd better get good at those first few areas. I was really looking forward to this game and now I'm just angry that I've purchased it.\n\nIf masochism and self-mutilation are your thing, then by all means: Go for it! Anyone who just wants to play a fun, challenging platform game can spend their money on Spelunky, Shovel Knight, Axiom Verge, or any of the dozens of other titles on Steam that are more rewarding, more forgiving, and certainly more fun.","November 7, 2015","false","1.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Odds are you probably haven't owned a car your whole life, right? I can assume you've had to walk to a store, or work, or the brothel, or your probation officer, or any place where you would much prefer some form of transportation that doesn't need to be tied to your feet first, right? You've also probably ridden in a car at some point in your life and I doubt you've ever found yourself thinking, "Gee, I sure do miss walking along the highway, dodging beer bottles being thrown by lucky but evil ♥♥♥♥♥", right? I would guess not. So let's get something straight. Going back to a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ era will most likely end with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ results. Can we all agree on that?\n\nWith that in mind, here's yet another game that totally would have shined through the vast sea of ♥♥♥♥ known as late 80's/early 90's video games, had it indeed been released on the Sega Genesis like it wishes. Which is an alright ambition, but when rubbing elbows with modern games, it only reminds us why the Sega Genesis was so ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and why the mistakes of that era must never ever be repeated.\n\nSure, there are plenty of games that do the whole 'retro thing', mostly because the people that can truly appreciate it are also old enough to have jobs, and wives, and children, and mid-life crisises, and most importantly; disposable income. But those are all just 'retro games', not 'games that take it too far by recreating all the ♥♥♥♥ everybody has been collectively trying to fix and forget about for the last 20 years because it's so ♥♥♥♥ing depressing to think that was the best form of entertainment we had for the first quarter of our lives'.\n\nIn other words, games like Shovel Knight, are modern games with retro graphics. Voltardo the Viking, on the other hand, is not modern. How can I tell? Well, the controls for one. You better be damn sure you know which direction you want to jump prior to jumping or ♥♥♥♥ just isn't going to work out for you. Why? Because you can't change direction in mid-air and, when you die, you start back at the beginning and have to slowly waddle your way through the whole level all over again. In fact, let me start a new paragraph for that one because I know there are mindless, drooling ♥♥♥♥♥ that can't be asked to pay attention through a whole 3 sentences.\n\nYou can't change direction in mid-air. Even if it's some sort of last ditch effort to avoid something that just spawned on the edge of the screen. And every time something does, it's too close and too late for you to react mid-jump. It's the exact same problem Vectorman had; the difficulty of the game is centered around the fact that you can't see anything farther away than ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ distance. But it's worse with ♥♥♥♥♥rr the Virginling because you're nearly defenseless while you're jumping and the only thing you can do is hit the attack button and hope for the best.\n\nTo clarify, when you jump, you only jump straight up and down, OR angled in a predetermined, unchangable arc. Never a mixture of the two. Once you jump, you relinquish all control over to the wrinkly, ♥♥♥♥-stained hand of fate and hope it's nice enough to let you land where you wanted. That's right folks, it's a platformer with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ jumping controls. And I don't mean accidentally ♥♥♥♥♥♥, like you might find in some very low level indie games. No, this kind of douchbaggery took skill. They have clearly spent a lot of time playing ♥♥♥♥♥♥ late 80's/early 90's platformers and successfully recreated the very same controls everybody was rushing to debug. I don't know how to follow that one up. I'm flabbergasted, really. Somebody intentionally recreated the '♥♥♥♥♥♥ platformer with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ jumping controls' genre and expects to be taken seriously. This is exactly the kind of grade A, choice cut ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t we've been struggling to overcome for the last 20-30 years. And they recreated it. I almost respect it in that anarchist sort of way.\n\nWhat's even more baffling are the people who gave it enough positive reviews to earn it a total score of "very positive". Are you ♥♥♥♥ing kidding me? Were games like Half-Life 2, the Borderlands series and pretty much all games that show any semblance of progress since Meatloaf stopped being popular getting too boring for you? Yeah, who the hell would want to play a game that's fun and entertaining when we can play games that herald back to a time when every ♥♥♥♥ing game on the market, EVERY ♥♥♥♥ING GAME ON THE MARKET, would rub ♥♥♥♥ in our eyes then yell at us for 90 minutes straight because our eyeballs smelled like ♥♥♥♥. Hell, why stop there? Why not build yourself an outhouse and start wiping your ♥♥♥ with corncobs while you're at it? Don't buy your butter from the grocery store anymore, churn it yourself. Want a salad? Start growing yourself one. Hell, here's a challenge if you want one so damn bad, try chasing your food down, pelting it with rocks and sticks for 3 days straight before finally eating it raw. Then when you're thirsty, try walking 8 or 9 miles to the closest stream and take a big gulp of bug, parasite and deer ♥♥♥♥ infested water.\n\nI will never understand this generation of entitled ♥♥♥♥tards who think "too easy" is a bad thing. Do you know how many people throughout time have wished for that kind of problem? Gonad the Ballbarian is the kind of fappery that isn't worth the time and money it takes to play or make, even if it is for the sake of all the people who feel bad about having ♥♥♥♥ too easy. If they want to suffer, let them buy an NES, a handful of random NES games and watch as they rage themselves into a coma. They'll all find out on their own why "too easy" is a problem you WANT to have.","July 6, 2015","false","3.4"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","33","2","6","2","0"

This is probably something I would have played and gotten into when I was 7 years old, paid for a rental, and didn't have any other choices for games, but at this point the platforming isn't really that rewarding or fun for the number of times you'll die.\n\nEvery time you lose you think you have to train yourself to be a better robot, pushing the buttons more precisely at the right times without error. With no additional gameplay mechanics or bells or whistles or draws to the game I can call this a pretty pure example of the "realtime precision button pressing" genre. That should be a steam game tag so I know to avoid it in future purchases.\n\nAs someone else stated, you will either waste a lot of time on this game trying to prove you are hardcore or be done with it in 15 minutes. I can't help but think all the wannabe badasses who love this game are under 21, bored, and competing in their own version of an arm wrestling contest with Internet strangers OR are maybe prone to crying out at night "I'm too weak!

It highly relies on learning from your own mistakes but not in a fair way. You will die at every new trap and will have to restart your whole tedious run again. As i remember, Ghosts'n Goblins had more frequent checkpoints and better lives system, which made it more friendly for practice and highly adaptable, depending on your skill in genre. In Volgar there's more "puzzling" approach to every obstacle, which you have to memorize after. Its pretty nice but done wrong, intentionally killing you no matter how good you are.\nmechanics is what made this game great for me, interesting spear platforming system, rolling, shield blocking, a bit clunky but adaptable jumping and etc. Really easy to get into but hard to master. I wouldn't mind level editor for this, as i see really huge potential for custom levels here.\nSo, intentionally unpolished doesn't mean it's still not unpolished. I would like if they added easier mode, so players could adapt to game faster, and only then try their best on 1-life run. I think this is the only fair way, as i got bored pretty quickly from getting to the first boss on my first try without any hits and constantly dying from him, only to start from the beginning. I can take the challenge, but not when it has this tedious feel to it.

I get it that everyone goes crazy any time anyone tries to make a NES-style 90's action game. I also get it that anytime I game specifically labels itself "hard" and uses archaic design or poor level/mechanic design to have you die all the time and constantly repeat the same parts over and over so you waste your life, just to beat one part to feel good about yourself, people go crazy as well and love it. Although old games were fun, there were reasons some mechanics were advanced, people they sucked but they didn't have the ability at the time to improve them due to specification limitations and technology. This game nails the early 90's look. The character feels super clunky and can only jump 1 inch. He can't aim and only knows how to look and shoot forward, and for some inexplicable reason once he's crouched he loses the ability to throw spears. All this makes him frustrating to play with. Also the jump attack is worthless. If someone jumps over at you and you try and jump to hit them, since they are way higher than you and you can't aim, you automatically get hit and can't do anything about it. Also if you attack a guy and he has more than 1 hitpoint, he can hit you while he is taking damage, which makes no sense, because if someone was slashing you with a sword you probably would have to react to that first before attacking.\n\nThere are other things like how you throwing a spear actually moves you forward in the game. If you quit you have to restart the level/world over again. There was one part in the first level where there is this small jump with spikes below it, but because you can barely jump you aren't able to make it and have to just keep retrying it, dying, and starting everything over again. Poor design. Also you have can take one hit, no health or lives. you can pick up armor to mitigate damage, so you may take 1-3 hits or so, but because of the design thats super easy, and its not fun starting over again. I never felt a death was my fault or because I didn't do something. It was always because I "couldn't" do something due to limitations and poor design.\n\nNow I know that tons of the "hardcore" people that wasted countless hours of their lives retrying levels may be butthurt I pointed a lot of this out, but that's just my opinion. I like being given the tools to succeed, not poor design forcing me to die countless times until I finally beat a part to fill up my self-esteem. But hey if that's for you then this game is just what you're looking for. 4/10.","May 22, 2015","false","2.7"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","5"

I think it is irritating that levels rarely have checkpoints and the only difficulty is aggressively high. Don't think, I'm a casual ♥♥♥♥♥ gamer. I like Demon's Souls and Dark souls and I am a huge fan of Super Meat Boy and Gothic. Volgarr however seems to remaster only the bad things from our NES era. Why do I have to go through half a level (that is already known to me and its walkthrough already goes automatic for me) only to encounter swift difficult moment that I am stuck in and die in few seconds? Why can't I pierce the wall of an enemy with my spear if they are out of the screen? There is a wall just on the next screen. Why is it so hard for a spear to find it? Controls are not as responsive as it is required for some ingame moments. You know, there is a reason why developers abandon these things. I want to be able to practice one difficult moment in the middle of the level only. I want to try different tactics, learn the patterns, but for every try I have to go through a long starting part of the level that I already know. Sine Mora has special mode that allows you to practice boss fights only.  Super Meat boy does not have checkpoints because each level is 30 seconds long (maximum). Volgarr is not that unique for me to be dragged through already experienced gameplay over and over untill some intense moment everytime I die.

Its a boring hard grind from start to finnish. The game tries its hardest to kill you in cheap ways, miss time a jump - dead, swing your weapon at the wrong time - dead, use the downward attack (doesnt work 25% of the time) - dead. Start from the beggining of the level and redo it all without any mistakes. If you get hit once on the way to the boss you may aswel restart. It tries to be hard for the sake of being hard which doesnt lead to an enjoyable experience.\n\nThe game pads its length out by making you redo the levels everytime you die, this made sense back when we were all playing megadrive games and you couldnt save progress but this is 2014 and we have moved on from this artificial style of difficuilty. While the majority of games these days are far to easy and hold your hand through everything this game goes the exact opposite way and too far in that direction. Its hard because you have to remmember the location of every enemy and their attack pattern and the exact way to deal with that enemy in that location, the game is basically one long session of memorising trivial details and then carrying out those movements precisely each time.\n\nThe game has a certain charm to its style and it can be satisfying when you finnaly defeat that boss you were stuck on. There is pretty much no story, your a viking, go forward and hit things, you pick up gear to take more hits and do more damage, get hit and you lose that gear. It tries to be somewhat of a 2d darksouls, but that game betters it in every concievable way, the game is hard to better portray its story not for the sake of being hard, the combat system far superior etc.\n\nIts a hark back to old style games which is fun for 30 minutes and then you remmember why you dont still play those games.","May 14, 2014","false","5.3"," 15 of 36 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","15","36","0","0"

I'd understand if you couldn't change your direction even when double jumping, but the current system does not bode well with my mindset of gaming canon. OFC I understand that knockback is herited from old platformers this game seems to be an homage to, but in my opinion, we could nowadays do well without that relic.

In other words, a lot of people crushed their skulls in some sort of mechanical accident, and seem to remember every single classic game as being brutally difficult.  I know for a fact, being 34 years old, that not every game was this way.  There were quite a few games that offered health, lives, powerups, passwords, and continues to help you progress.  Even when you barely made it through a tough boss fight, you still felt like you were progressing.\nVolgarr the Viking is a well made game that doesn't capitalize on being cheap.  All the enemies are static for the most part, so you can learn the patterns after a while.  If you keep messing up, it's your fault.  Just change the way you look at things, and you will progress.  There are powerups to give you shields, an extra piece of armor, or even a flaming sword.  You just have to get powerups(chests) consecutively to get the full set.  First pickup is always a shield, unless you already have one.  So if you lose your shield, your next powerup will be another shield to replace it.  If you still have a shield when you get the next powerup, you get a better one, and a better spear.  Keep that pattern going of not getting hit(easier said than done), and you get better and better stuff.  Without this gear, you are literally one hit, one kill.  Pretty flimsy for a Viking badass.  :D\n\nI enjoy this game quite a bit, even if it makes me cuss.

The "Rise Warrior" at the beginning seems a lot like the "Rise from your grave" when you start a new game on Altered Beast; doesn't it? I've also noticed references to Castlevania, Ghouls n' Ghosts, and Legend of Zelda II: The Adventure of Link. All this has been gleaned as I'm only halfway through the second stage.

This is a game designed in the style of arcade cabinets and the first few generations of home console games.  It's full of pattern memorization, precise timing, obscure mechanics you need to work out for yourself, and repetition.   I found myself dredging up skills I learned from classic NES games, training muscle memory into my fingers to get past each section.  The one major change from games of that era is infinite lives: No longer do you only have 10, or 3, or even just 1 try to learn and beat an area before you have to start over.  Instead, it breaks it down into well-paced but brutal sections, and death sends you back to the beginning of the section.  (Quitting, however, sends you back to the very beginning, although I'm told there's a warp system).\n\nAll in all, I suggest picking this up, if you're prepared to find yourself immersed in a "Nintendo Hard"[tvtropes.org] game, something that's exceedingly rare these days.","January 11, 2015","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In places, the level design is pretty much a carbon copy.  Volgarr however is a significantly different beast.  The checkpoint restart system and unique moves set give this game an irresistible one more go replay value.  The difficulty level is set just right too.  You will die repeateatedly - very repeatedly - but you'll always know it's your own fault, and with a little practice everything is achievable. This is one of the main things that makes Volgarr so enjoyable.\n\nIt's nothing special graphically, but this appears to be the intention.  The game's obviously going for a retro approach to the graphics, and to be honest it benefits from it.  It just wouldn't feel the same with slick, HD visuals.\n\nIf you're still not sure, go check it out on YouTube.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dawgface/recommended/247240/","Dawgface","DuckyBread","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dawgface/","953 products in account","♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, this game is tougher than a pot of boiled ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s!\n\n\nBUT IN A GOOD WAY, HONEST!\n\nIt truly does live up to the claim of being hard like the games of the past. It's tons of pattern and level memorization, and always remembering what powers are at your disposal.\n\nThe game is unforgiving, but does not ONCE treat the player like they're stupid. The game KNOWS you're smart and challenges you to prove it through tough enemy, trap, and obstacle placement. There's tons of trail and error, so be prepared to restart a board many a time until you know it like the back of your hand.\n\nThat said though, the boards can be quite lengthy, which makes the fact that you have to clear them on one life a bit of a chore (given you have to restart from the beginning every death). That's one complaint: no mid-way checkpoints. But I suppose that's something modern games have spoiled us with. So not really a complaint, more like a "UGHHH MODERN GAMING WHHHY" point.\n\nAlthough I do have a legitimate complaint: The controls. I've been playing with a 360 pad which is a no brainer for me given this is a side scrolling platform which, in my books, demands the precision. Now, having said that, I find the controls while responsive and good, can also be pretty clunky. Does that make sense? No? Well lemme try and explain.\n\nYou basically work on 3 inputs, A, X and your joystick (d-pad). A jumps, X attacks, and your joystick moves. Simple right? Well, holding up on the joystick draws your spear, and then pressing X throws said spear (and with later power ups, holding up for an extended period powers your throw). I'm not sure if it affects play or not, but sometimes while jumping, I'll hold up and draw my spear, which often gets me killed. I'm not sure if it adjusts the player's hit box while doing so, but I'm going to say it does for the sake of my argument, although it may turn out I'm just crap.\n\nSecond point: You have 2 jumps. A standard leap, and pressing jump once again while in a jump will cause you to spin your sword and perform a double jump. Pretty standard fare, right?\n\nWell, if you just plain press jump, you'll jump straight up and be unable to move, but if you move and jump, you're committed to your jump arch (think original Castlevania style). So, ok, not so bad right?\nThis is where things get UUGHGHHHH.\n\nIf you are in mid jump arch and double jump without holding the intended direction you want to go in, your second jump CANCELS your jump arch.\n\nNow I know WHY they did it, for more precise platforming, but it can really mess you up if you don't anticipate the game. And one slip up means you can be toast and have to start all over again. It's a bit frustrating.\n\nGOOD POINTS THOUGH!\nThe simplistic controls take getting used to, but they can be mastered easily since there isn't a whole lot of complexity to them (besides what I listed above). And while restarting a level is a pain, the pixel art is soooo gorgeous and the animations are so smooth and nice that it eases that pain a bit.\n\nAs well, the game does a great job of building avatar strength through the power up system, and the best example of this is through the spears.\n\nJust plain Jane, you can throw a basic spear and more often than not, it'll kill an enemy in one hit and destroy itself. A second upgrade will give you a shield that can block up to two hits. Now this third upgrade gives you a slightly cooler looking shield AND powers up your spear. How does this affect your spear? Well now you can ♥♥♥♥ING PIN GUYS TO WALLS! It's so bad ♥♥♥, let me tell you. If you can nail a line of enemies with a fully charged spear, nothing screams satisfaction like watching them all get sent flying by your man-missile. Upgrades beyond this add additional hit points to the player, and eventually a fire spraying sword.\n\nIn short, if you're looking for a classic feeling game with a steep (but rewarding) challenge, pick it up!\n\nIf you're looking for something a bit more relaxed, you may want to look else where.\n\nI give Volgarr an 8 out of 10!","September 16, 2013","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

The game is brutally punishing, and very challenging.  But the game is so structured that everytime you die it is your fault, even if it was slipping up for just a moment.  Enemies telegraph their attacks, they are very predictable, bosses have very recognizable patterns, and so on.  You would think this would make the game too easy, but because the game punishes even the slightest of misteps, and checkpoints are far between, you may find it takes a long time to beat this game.  It is a relatively short game, but I would say it has good replay value if you're the kind of person who likes to 100% things, or if you like a challenge, as the game presents a bonus hard path if you manage to max out your power ups without losing them across multiple checkpoints.\n\nMy only beef with the game is that there is no saving.  I know it is trying to go for that old game feel, and certainly the original Super Mario didn't let you save your game, but I feel like this only detracts from the game, rather than adds to its charm.  But to each their own, the game is short enough that this isn't a serious problem, and if you managed to beat the first few levels, then you should be able to beat them relatively easily again.\n\nEDIT:  Correction, you can skip worlds you've already completed by going left at the beginning of the level.  This pretty much resolves my only issue with the game!  Please give this excellent game a shot!","December 13, 2013","true","13.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

In other words, a lot of people crushed their skulls in some sort of mechanical accident, and seem to remember every single classic game as being brutally difficult.  I know for a fact, being 34 years old, that not every game was this way.  There were quite a few games that offered health, lives, powerups, passwords, and continues to help you progress.  Even when you barely made it through a tough boss fight, you still felt like you were progressing.\nVolgarr the Viking is a well made game that doesn't capitalize on being cheap.  All the enemies are static for the most part, so you can learn the patterns after a while.  If you keep messing up, it's your fault.  Just change the way you look at things, and you will progress.  There are powerups to give you shields, an extra piece of armor, or even a flaming sword.  You just have to get powerups(chests) consecutively to get the full set.  First pickup is always a shield, unless you already have one.  So if you lose your shield, your next powerup will be another shield to replace it.  If you still have a shield when you get the next powerup, you get a better one, and a better spear.  Keep that pattern going of not getting hit(easier said than done), and you get better and better stuff.  Without this gear, you are literally one hit, one kill.  Pretty flimsy for a Viking badass.  :D\n\nI enjoy this game quite a bit, even if it makes me cuss.

It is certainly one of the most if not the most difficult action platformer I have ever played. Though it is tough to the max, it is equally as fun as it is tough for anyone who enjoys the classic gameplay heavily borrowed from the Rastan Saga and polished up. Not only is this game Rastan without the kinks, but it gives major nods to many classic games of the genre. The "Rise Warrior" at the beginning seems a lot like the "Rise from your grave" when you start a new game on Altered Beast; doesn't it? I've also noticed references to Castlevania, Ghouls n' Ghosts, and Legend of Zelda II: The Adventure of Link. All this has been gleaned as I'm only halfway through the second stage. I'm sure I'll catch more references as I progress, yet many probably continue to slip by right under my nose.\n\nIf you have a bit of a masochistic streak and a love for all things old school platformer, GAME THIS PLAY!","June 17, 2014","true","13.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Spend an hour getting past just the first level? Quit after spending a half hour on level 2? Well, bad news, because you'll have to start straight from the beginning with no saves or continues if you choose to quit the game (which any normal human will do, at some point or another).\n\nThat's right, its just like an arcade game-- which is clearly the style this game succeeds at emulating-- no saves or continues once you stop playing. You get checkpoints, 1 per level, whilst you play, but once you quit that's it.\n\nI love the game, I really do, and I was lucky enough to get it on sale for less than $5.00, but I can't help but feel a little ripped off due to this single element of the game.\n\nThat being said, some will thrive from the old-school challenge, experiencing deja' vu from the 80's-90's arcade era-- knowing that it's all or nothing. Once you stop playing or run out of quarters, you'll have to try again next time right from the start.\n\nFor its challenge, controls, retro appeal, and sheer enjoyability, this game deserves an 8/10. The no-saves feature holds this challenging Castlevania-style game back from being a fully-fledged game.

Volgarr the Viking is one of those precious gems. It finds its difficulty, not in cheap deaths or overpowered enemies, but by giving you a variety of ways to deal with challenges and leaving it up to you to decide which course of action will lead to success, and leaving it in your hands to execute it flawlessly.\n\nEvery step towards the end introduces a new challenge, combining existing traps and enemies in a new way, forcing you to rethink your new strategy on the fly or die trying. It is not unfair, however, and introduces any new traps or enemies well in advance on their own, before blending them with any other traps or foes.\n\nThe secrets are superb, especially Thor's blessing, which (as far as I've seen) requires the unwavering courage to climb down to the very edge of a vine to strike at a hidden wall, or down-thrust your sword into a flower that spews deadly spores straight into your face.\n\nThis game is certainly no slouch.

Volgarr the Viking is one of those precious gems. It finds its difficulty, not in cheap deaths or overpowered enemies, but by giving you a variety of ways to deal with challenges and leaving it up to you to decide which course of action will lead to success, and leaving it in your hands to execute it flawlessly.\n\nEvery step towards the end introduces a new challenge, combining existing traps and enemies in a new way, forcing you to rethink your new strategy on the fly or die trying. It is not unfair, however, and introduces any new traps or enemies well in advance on their own, before blending them with any other traps or foes.\n\nThe secrets are superb, especially Thor's blessing, which (as far as I've seen) requires the unwavering courage to climb down to the very edge of a vine to strike at a hidden wall, or down-thrust your sword into a flower that spews deadly spores straight into your face.\n\nThis game is certainly no slouch. It will break you, but if you have the strength to persevere, you will rise from your own ashes and pay this game back every blow it has dealt you.","May 28, 2014","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

GET OUT","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ping-pong2012/","497 products in account","Volgarr tries to take the gameplay style of older games, but forgets to take the mechanics. Enemies out-pace your swing, and animations are painfully long stun-locks, so you'll frequently be losing health/abilities to animations. If they were consistent, it wouldn't be so bad, but a spear thrown in air is near instant, while a ground spear takes many times longer and locks you into the animation.\n\nAs enemies are often above and below you, you might be inclined to attack them - except jumping takes time and will lock your direction, and while you may swing your sword, it attacks forward, not in at any incline, so every jumping guy will get priority for hitting you. As the shield only sometimes is effective (shield direction doesn't change either), a few pixels make the difference between blocking a jumping guy, and getting hit by them. In any case, if you are decently far into a level and lose your shield, it is far more practical just to immediately die and start over, because random control weirdness will kill you. A note on sword-mechanics is you hold your sword straight up, and when you swing, it doesn't go through your front, so if an enemy is up-right you can't hit it, but you can if it is above or in front. At the same time, sometimes when you're done throwing a spear, if you press the sword attack key, you will instead throw another spear, which introduces some of that animation locking when you're not expecting it.\n\nIn some vein it tries to take fixed-jumping mechanics, but then your second jump can influence your direction. Inconsistently, as in the first level, jumping against a certain wall can easily launch you over a smalll edge on the second jump straight into spikes.\n\nThe "look ahead feature" is just a zoom out, and overall it feels like the game had good controls at one point (including a wider view), then to stand out, they threw in fixed-travel-distance spears, leaderboards/time trial, and animation locks to ramp up difficulty, instead of just letting the game be fun without having to memorize every level or be crippled as soon as you start getting hit.\n\nMake no mistake, this IS a trial-by-death game, except the death part is painfully long-winded and perfectionist marred by poor controls. Sonic, Kirby, Little Nemo, even Castlevania 1, any of their mechanics would have made this game far more tolerable.","September 2, 2014","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You will find yourself dying quite often as you figure out how to traverse the game. Every part of the mechanics from the double jump, the spear throw to the ducking roll comes into play without feeling put there in vain. The soundtrack is a more modern score that doesn't seem out of place with the old school graphics. In a world of pixely retro inspired games, Volgarr the Viking actually feels like it would fit right into the SNES or Sega Genesis library without all the short comings of a lot of titles from that time. NOT for players that hate to replay long sections over after death. This game rewards patience. Trying to slash your way to the end of a stage will not get it done here.

The game is tough, but the difficulty does not come from the complexity of the levels or any impossible enemy. No, the levels are fairly simple by design and the enemies are slow and dumb. So, where's the problem. The problem is in the controlls. For example, you cannot change the direction of your jump and that is your biggest enemy, They made some things right in this game, but left many others (I presume intentionally) broken. On top of that they designed the levels to benefit exactly from your impediments which is extremely cheap.\n\nAnd the worst thing - the dealbreaker - is the save system, or the lack of one such. The game consists of 5 levels (a sixth level and some bonus/secret stuff is also there, but this is the main thing). Each level is split in two parts and has a boss fight at the end. Listen closely! Whenever you die you resurect at the beginning of the part of the level you died in. The second part includes the boss as well. So, given that the bosses are based on patterns (at least those I saw before I abandoned the game) you will need to die at least a few times so you know what to do. Each time you die you must go through the whole second part of the level! You accidently jumped at the wrong direction and cannot turn back mid-jump? Back at the beginning! This accumulates a lot of game time for nothing and this precious game time can be spent in other, more awarding games.\n\nSadly, I don't recommend this game to anyone except some REALLY hardcore overachieving complitionists. For God's sake, the game has GUI timers for fast runs, as if the game is famous for the skill you can gain...","May 7, 2015","false","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Think Castlevania 1 or 3.\n\nThe distinguishing feature of this game is that it's pretty difficult due to some unusual, unforgiving design choices. For starters, you have no horizontal air control at all, like the old Castlevanias, though you have a double jump. There is also a surprising amount of recovery after landing a jump. In addition, you die after only 1-3 hits, and getting hit causes you to lose an entire tier of power-ups.\n\nThe problem I have with the game is that it doesn't seem difficult in a particularly fun way. For example, at the very beginning you're going to die a ton just learning what you can block, enemy behavior, how to space jumps, and how to deal with enemies coming from above and below you. There's no real tutorial level to teach you the basics, which just means you're going to die a lot.\n\nOn top of that, the health system is really brutal. The game basically rewards you hugely for playing perfectly by giving you a way better weapon and better defense, but as soon as you take any 1 hit you lose that advantage. It's a weird system, because the game essentially becomes harder the less good you are the game. If you're really good and can play levels perfectly, you'll coast along with a weapon that does double damage with extra range, better blocking, and which is faster, along with the buffer health. If you're imperfect, you have to make do with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ weapons/blocking.\n\nOn top of all that, it's a very slow game, that's very low on improvization or surprises. Everything is very predictable, and the game moves at such a deliberate pace that it's principally a memorization/timing challenge.\n\nThere are some cool moments in the levels, and the graphics have a really nice aesthetic, but it's just not a very fun game to play. It's very much a game about perfectionism, and it's just not really very fun to learn. I'm actually a big fan of the old, hard platformer castlevanias, and 2d action-platformers in general, but this game is just not a particularly good example of the genre.","May 7, 2015","false","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you've got the time to put in & aquire the neccessary skill to beat the game then you should pick it up.  Even if you don't, you'll still get a kick out of it if you enjoy classic arcade style games.\n\nThe game has a lot going for it & a lot of hidden goodies like the level select.  After you beat a level, you can skip it simply by moving left at the beginning of the stage.  Of course, if you want to do the Valkyrie levels you will need to play through the entire game on one life & earn Valkyrie Souls by opening all the chests.\n\nIf you're able to get through a level without getting hit & opening all the chests you gain credits that enable you to choose the Valkyrie levels after you beat a stage.  Just know that the Valkyrie stages are much harder than the Viking ones & the Viking ones are already pretty darn hard.\n\nWhen you go through the game you should take in your surroundings & treat everything like a puzzle because it's pretty much set up to be done a certain way.  If you manage to figure it out you can progress through it with near perfection & not getting hit a single time.\n\nOverall, if you like classic arcade style action platform games then you should get this one.  It's worth every penny & if you can get it on a sale then that's even better.  All the frustration is worth it if you can somehow play through this game to the end.

You only ever have two weapons: a sword and a throwing spear. The sword can be used in a few ways and upgraded to a fire version (if you're good enough), but the real star of the show is the spear. Not only can it be used to attack enemies from afar (infinitely), but it can also be used to make platforms to stand on by throwing them at walls. And that's not just a fun gimmick... there are numerous chests out of reach through normal means until you find clever ways to throw spears and make paths to them.\n\nThat's also how much of the battles unfold. It's not really a good idea to charge ahead and hope for the best so much as learn how enemies attack and make deliberate movements in order to vanquish them. The bosses work the same way too. Believe me, you'll die plenty of times fighting them, but each death helps you learn their pattern and once you know it, you can bring them down without taking a hit. Thank goodness for unlimited lives, eh?\n\nJust in case it isn't hard enough, there's actually a harder alternate version of each stage (with limited lives) that you can only get to by playing the previous stage near-flawlessly. And the only way to get the best ending is to do that for every stage.\n\n\nIf you miss the good ol' days of fair but unrelenting difficulty, pick this sucker up.","December 13, 2013","true","11.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's tons of pattern and level memorization, and always remembering what powers are at your disposal.\n\nThe game is unforgiving, but does not ONCE treat the player like they're stupid. The game KNOWS you're smart and challenges you to prove it through tough enemy, trap, and obstacle placement. There's tons of trail and error, so be prepared to restart a board many a time until you know it like the back of your hand.\n\nThat said though, the boards can be quite lengthy, which makes the fact that you have to clear them on one life a bit of a chore (given you have to restart from the beginning every death). That's one complaint: no mid-way checkpoints. But I suppose that's something modern games have spoiled us with. So not really a complaint, more like a "UGHHH MODERN GAMING WHHHY" point.\n\nAlthough I do have a legitimate complaint: The controls. I've been playing with a 360 pad which is a no brainer for me given this is a side scrolling platform which, in my books, demands the precision. Now, having said that, I find the controls while responsive and good, can also be pretty clunky. Does that make sense? No? Well lemme try and explain.\n\nYou basically work on 3 inputs, A, X and your joystick (d-pad). A jumps, X attacks, and your joystick moves. Simple right? Well, holding up on the joystick draws your spear, and then pressing X throws said spear (and with later power ups, holding up for an extended period powers your throw). I'm not sure if it affects play or not, but sometimes while jumping, I'll hold up and draw my spear, which often gets me killed. I'm not sure if it adjusts the player's hit box while doing so, but I'm going to say it does for the sake of my argument, although it may turn out I'm just crap.\n\nSecond point: You have 2 jumps. A standard leap, and pressing jump once again while in a jump will cause you to spin your sword and perform a double jump. Pretty standard fare, right?\n\nWell, if you just plain press jump, you'll jump straight up and be unable to move, but if you move and jump, you're committed to your jump arch (think original Castlevania style). So, ok, not so bad right?\nThis is where things get UUGHGHHHH.\n\nIf you are in mid jump arch and double jump without holding the intended direction you want to go in, your second jump CANCELS your jump arch.\n\nNow I know WHY they did it, for more precise platforming, but it can really mess you up if you don't anticipate the game. And one slip up means you can be toast and have to start all over again. It's a bit frustrating.\n\nGOOD POINTS THOUGH!\nThe simplistic controls take getting used to, but they can be mastered easily since there isn't a whole lot of complexity to them (besides what I listed above). And while restarting a level is a pain, the pixel art is soooo gorgeous and the animations are so smooth and nice that it eases that pain a bit.\n\nAs well, the game does a great job of building avatar strength through the power up system, and the best example of this is through the spears.\n\nJust plain Jane, you can throw a basic spear and more often than not, it'll kill an enemy in one hit and destroy itself. A second upgrade will give you a shield that can block up to two hits. Now this third upgrade gives you a slightly cooler looking shield AND powers up your spear. How does this affect your spear? Well now you can ♥♥♥♥ING PIN GUYS TO WALLS! It's so bad ♥♥♥, let me tell you. If you can nail a line of enemies with a fully charged spear, nothing screams satisfaction like watching them all get sent flying by your man-missile. Upgrades beyond this add additional hit points to the player, and eventually a fire spraying sword.\n\nIn short, if you're looking for a classic feeling game with a steep (but rewarding) challenge, pick it up!\n\nIf you're looking for something a bit more relaxed, you may want to look else where.\n\nI give Volgarr an 8 out of 10!","September 16, 2013","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Spend an hour getting past just the first level? Quit after spending a half hour on level 2? Well, bad news, because you'll have to start straight from the beginning with no saves or continues if you choose to quit the game (which any normal human will do, at some point or another).\n\nThat's right, its just like an arcade game-- which is clearly the style this game succeeds at emulating-- no saves or continues once you stop playing. You get checkpoints, 1 per level, whilst you play, but once you quit that's it.\n\nI love the game, I really do, and I was lucky enough to get it on sale for less than $5.00, but I can't help but feel a little ripped off due to this single element of the game.\n\nThat being said, some will thrive from the old-school challenge, experiencing deja' vu from the 80's-90's arcade era-- knowing that it's all or nothing. Once you stop playing or run out of quarters, you'll have to try again next time right from the start.\n\nFor its challenge, controls, retro appeal, and sheer enjoyability, this game deserves an 8/10. The no-saves feature holds this challenging Castlevania-style game back from being a fully-fledged game. Again, some will really love that, but in these days where time is a constraint for most, its a nuissance.","May 16, 2014","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Every mistake you make is your fault, not the fault of the game. If i had to describe the gameplay of VOLGARR THE VIKING I had to choose this: A combination of CASTELVANIA, GHOULS AND GOBLINS and THE LEGEND OF ZELDA2 THE ADVENTURE OF LINK. Those 3 games combined but ten-times harder. And trust me it's difficult to make a game that is harder than GHOULS AND GOBLINS. Playing Volgarr is kinda like playing memory... on acid. If you would hand me a piece of paper and a pen I could draw a map for all the levels I've beaten, without looking it up. I know every bit of this game by heart and if you play it through you will too! So is Volgarr a good game? YES it is!

A revisit to the types of arcade games from the early 90's that would make you waste all of your quarters without passing the first stage. Here's a tl;dr for those of you who want the basic idea of this game.\n\nPros:\nTight controls.\nPolished, timeless graphics that tend to make you forget you're playing a 16-bit game.\n\nCons:\nOverly artificial difficulty.\n\nThe difficulty in this game doesn't warrant praise, in my personal opinion. It feels like the developers thought up a tight platforming world with simple (yet satisfying) puzzles, then completely littered the world with enemies that you have literally no time to react to on your first encounter. You will find yourself repeating the same process time after time, and not really feeling any sense of accomplishment after each time you overcome the poorly designed way they implemented "difficulty".\n\nIf you liked the feeling Gouls and Ghosts gave you as a child, you'll enjoy this game.","January 9, 2015","false","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Plus if and when you quit the game the next time you start it back up you find yourself all the way back at the beginning of the first level. There is no saves.

You will feel frustrated not with the game but with each devicive challenge in your way. I like the visual hitpoint system of each layer of armor and sword upgrade is an additional hit, and the timing for the challenges is enough to encourage repeated attempts.

Spend an hour getting past just the first level? Quit after spending a half hour on level 2? Well, bad news, because you'll have to start straight from the beginning with no saves or continues if you choose to quit the game (which any normal human will do, at some point or another).\n\nThat's right, its just like an arcade game-- which is clearly the style this game succeeds at emulating-- no saves or continues once you stop playing. You get checkpoints, 1 per level, whilst you play, but once you quit that's it.\n\nI love the game, I really do, and I was lucky enough to get it on sale for less than $5.00, but I can't help but feel a little ripped off due to this single element of the game.\n\nThat being said, some will thrive from the old-school challenge, experiencing deja' vu from the 80's-90's arcade era-- knowing that it's all or nothing. Once you stop playing or run out of quarters, you'll have to try again next time right from the start.\n\nFor its challenge, controls, retro appeal, and sheer enjoyability, this game deserves an 8/10. The no-saves feature holds this challenging Castlevania-style game back from being a fully-fledged game. Again, some will really love that, but in these days where time is a constraint for most, its a nuissance.","May 16, 2014","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Völgarr the Viking is hard in the same way that early entries in the Castlevania series are hard. Yes, it's not something that just anyone can pick up, play, and enjoy. No, this is not necessarily a good thing, but some players need that extra bit of a triumphant feeling in completing a level.\nOne thing that's clear from the very outset is that this is in no way one of those modern games that so many grognards accuse of excessive handholding. No, you're thrown right into the world from the beginning, with no direction but the innate instinct to go right. Be sure to check out the game's manual, too, as it explains a few helpful concepts that the game's (intentionally) meager tutorial might not make explicitly clear. Be sure to check it out, also, for the fact that it's a loving recreation of the kinds of manuals one finds packaged with (better) retro cartridge games, although black and white would have lent that extra sense of nostalgia.\nThe graphics are old-school only in the sense that there's a (relatively) limited color palette and movement occurs in only two dimensions, as you slash and spear your way through seemingly endless ranks of palette-swapped enemies of varying strength and ability. There's clearly a lot of love on display in the general and specific "feel" of it all.\nVölgarr the Viking is absolutely not for everyone, and it never intends to be, but if you're of the kind who enjoys approaching combat as just as much of a puzzle in rhythm and positioning as the rest of the level, it might just be the game for you.","December 29, 2014","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is tough, but the difficulty does not come from the complexity of the levels or any impossible enemy. No, the levels are fairly simple by design and the enemies are slow and dumb. So, where's the problem. The problem is in the controlls. For example, you cannot change the direction of your jump and that is your biggest enemy, They made some things right in this game, but left many others (I presume intentionally) broken. On top of that they designed the levels to benefit exactly from your impediments which is extremely cheap.\n\nAnd the worst thing - the dealbreaker - is the save system, or the lack of one such. The game consists of 5 levels (a sixth level and some bonus/secret stuff is also there, but this is the main thing). Each level is split in two parts and has a boss fight at the end. Listen closely! Whenever you die you resurect at the beginning of the part of the level you died in. The second part includes the boss as well. So, given that the bosses are based on patterns (at least those I saw before I abandoned the game) you will need to die at least a few times so you know what to do. Each time you die you must go through the whole second part of the level! You accidently jumped at the wrong direction and cannot turn back mid-jump? Back at the beginning! This accumulates a lot of game time for nothing and this precious game time can be spent in other, more awarding games.\n\nSadly, I don't recommend this game to anyone except some REALLY hardcore overachieving complitionists. For God's sake, the game has GUI timers for fast runs, as if the game is famous for the skill you can gain...","May 7, 2015","false","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A revisit to the types of arcade games from the early 90's that would make you waste all of your quarters without passing the first stage.

It feels like the developers thought up a tight platforming world with simple (yet satisfying) puzzles, then completely littered the world with enemies that you have literally no time to react to on your first encounter. You will find yourself repeating the same process time after time, and not really feeling any sense of accomplishment after each time you overcome the poorly designed way they implemented "difficulty".\n\nIf you liked the feeling Gouls and Ghosts gave you as a child, you'll enjoy this game.","January 9, 2015","false","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I don't know what you guys did with it but it's pretty horrible...\nThe jump works like this : you can jump one time then jump another time when you're in air - so that's a basic double jump.\nHowever, it doesn't work like a regular double jump... No no, it's like this : say you're going to the right and press jump once, your character will jump to the right. Now if you jump with a direction input while you're in air, your character will keep the same direction, which means that you cannot land precisely where you want...\nYes I know, you can jump once in a direction then jump while in air with no direction input to land below...

(Thankfully, no stairs!)\nYour offensive options consist of a sword and an infinite supply of spears, which can also be used as platforms.\n\nDuring a first playthrough, you ought to be careful and approach situations slowly, but as you start mastering the game, you'll be able to flow at a satisfying pace through the levels.\n\nBosses are a matter of memorizing their patterns and finding the safe spots and the opportune times to strike.\n\nThere are three ending to get, each requiring more of the player, but not unfairly so.\nThe two additional endings raise the ante by requiring you to go through alternative stages on a limited supply of "lives," which you must earn by traversing the stages near flawlessly.\n\nRecommended controls: gamepad with a good D-pad and at least two buttons (ideally four, for pause and view toggle)\n(I played with a sideways Wiimote.)\n\nPros:\nEasy to learn and difficult to master\nTight controls\nWell polished\nGood replayability, with alternate levels, three endings, and a leaderboard\nMost achievements attained naturally while completing all endings\nWell optimized. Runs well on humble hardware.\nCons:\nNo mid-session save feature. (Prevents save-scumming; inconvenient nonetheless.)\nMust-do:\nGo in the options and set the option "use look ahead as a toggle," otherwise you'll be hitting the look ahead button way too frequently.","July 10, 2015","true","57.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's like they combined the best elements of Ghouls & Ghosts with Rastan & made a super tough arcade action platform experience.\n\nJust know that this game is hard.  Really really hard.  After 5 hours I haven't beaten the 2nd level HARD.\n\n~PROS\n-Solid Action/Platform Mechanics\n-Classic Arcade Style Elements\n-Easy to Learn/Hard to Master\n-Level Select Feature\n-Two Different Adventures\n\n~CONS\n-VERY HIGH Difficulty\n\nJust know before you play this game that you will die a lot & you will need to play it a lot in order to get good enough to beat even the first level, then even more for the following levels.  If you've got the time to put in & aquire the neccessary skill to beat the game then you should pick it up.  Even if you don't, you'll still get a kick out of it if you enjoy classic arcade style games.\n\nThe game has a lot going for it & a lot of hidden goodies like the level select.  After you beat a level, you can skip it simply by moving left at the beginning of the stage.  Of course, if you want to do the Valkyrie levels you will need to play through the entire game on one life & earn Valkyrie Souls by opening all the chests.\n\nIf you're able to get through a level without getting hit & opening all the chests you gain credits that enable you to choose the Valkyrie levels after you beat a stage.  Just know that the Valkyrie stages are much harder than the Viking ones & the Viking ones are already pretty darn hard.\n\nWhen you go through the game you should take in your surroundings & treat everything like a puzzle because it's pretty much set up to be done a certain way.  If you manage to figure it out you can progress through it with near perfection & not getting hit a single time.\n\nOverall, if you like classic arcade style action platform games then you should get this one.  It's worth every penny & if you can get it on a sale then that's even better.  All the frustration is worth it if you can somehow play through this game to the end.  Heck, I still haven't been able to do it but I'm gonna keep trying.","August 31, 2015","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Siking/recommended/247240/","Siking","Lallapallooza","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Siking/","95 products in account","Definitely my favourite platformer. It has tight controls, great enemy, boss and level design. Music gives a good atmosphere which gets you pumped and really puts you in the game.\n\nControls are spot on, everything is responsive and just feels good. Jumping is quite tricky, no turning mid air except with the second jump, which creates difficulty in jumping if you are too hasty. It's not very hard to learn, atleast from my own experience, but satisfying to pull off well.\n\nEnemies are generally predictable from first sight, but still makes you work them into your muscle memory. They are all fair, and the tough ones are generally first put in a position where you will have an easier time fighting them, and after youve beaten them once they will re-appear later on but in a much trickier spot where it will make you really think more than just using what you learnt from fighting them the first time.\n\nBosses can be tricky, but very manageable the first time around. They telegraph their attacks clearly and you can adapt to it if you have a good feel for these kinds of games.\n\nThe level design is great because it always manages to make you use all of your tools, tricky doublejumps, spear throws and rolls. Not too many instant death pits, instead enemies will be the real threats. Enemy spawns are pretty much always the same, so memorizing them is great fun when youve gotten to the point of nearly speedrunning through levels, trying to get the best ending.\n\nLike mentioned theres also different endings, and by running through the game once the normal way a new player would, you fight your way through the basic maps and get the, well, bad ending. But if you beat a level while not getting hit too many times you will get Warrior spirits that take you to the same themed levels, but with a much harder design. This makes for a great second playthrough attempting to get the best ending by beating all the hard maps.","June 27, 2015","true","15.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Get wrecked - Get the ♥♥♥♥ back to beginning of stage).\n\nWith knowing that, it should be self-explanatory that this game can be frustrating! It has a steep learning-curve, and the game itself will simply point out the basic controls. After that you are on your own to stumble like a peasant into the grim world of Volgarr the Viking. The first couple of hours you will be fine starting over again and again, because it forces you to pick up on the intricate combinations of movement and attack one can pull off in the game. That being said, for the average player and for the greater part of these two hours, this will likely simply lead you to die in new ways on the same obstacles!\n\nSo why play it? Well the game is so well-designed, the graphics so beautiful, the "feel" you get from chopping up bad-guys is so great and the music is so powerful and grim, that it feels like the game is entitled to be this hardcore. The combat mechanism is fluid in the sense that you can pull off insane combinations (I know so because I have seen it on youtube) but movement-wise, the game is quite conservative. There is no air-control (except you can start jumping left or right, and then with a second jump choose to stand-still in the air, or vica-verca) however you can do things like: Jump, throw a spear, swirlattack with an extra jump, throw another spear and drop down, sword first into an enemy.\n\nAn interesting mechanism to note too, and might perhaps be a motivator for new players, is that as you get better, you will get better equipment and weapons, making the game easier. Once you get moves into your fingers so you run with the adrenaline, rather than freezing at every enemy and getting cold-feet about progressing, the game will also become easier. I think this is a great mechanism - the learning curve is seriously steep, but once you climb the mountain, you'll truly be able to reap its' rewards!\n\nYou might say that I'm ineligible to review this game  after only two hours ingame time, but to tell you the truth, two hours is probably the amount of time most players will be willing to spend on this game, failing miserably and then not returning out of sheer frustration. Also, I have spent the same amount of time looking at videos and reading guides on the game.\n\nWith that said, for the hardcore gamers that is just dying for a REAL challenge, I do recommend it! For more average players I only recommend it if you are ready for a huge challenge, and you have ambitions to becomea hardcore gamer - none will dispute that if you can run this game!","May 24, 2015","true","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The problem is that the presentation really makes it too frustrating for all but hardcore platformer fans, as there is no real save system (you can reportedly sort of skip already beaten levels, but at a cost), no ability to control the difficulty, a tendency to put you back at the start of a level after you die, and half the levels apparently inaccessible unless you complete every level without really taking damage.\n\nControls are fairly tight and the graphics and music are good, although in the first couple levels I only encountered the same 5 enemy sprites, 3 of which were basically recolors of the same sprite. I also have to give kudos for a Linux port that runs well, including XBox 360 controller support (even rumble works!).\n\nStill, this game is intentionally at the Ghosts 'n Goblins level of difficulty, with no concessions to casual players (e.g. old guys with rusty platforming skills who don't have lots of time to play). As a result, I can't recommend it to anyone who is not a huge fan of super-challenging platformers.","July 6, 2015","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The Checkpoints are FLIPPIN' MADDENING! and it's why you won't want to keep playing this game.\n\nLISTEN, I've beaten hundreds of NES games, hundreds of SNES games and yatta yatta. I presume you have also, or at least beaten a couple.

The game is tough, but the difficulty does not come from the complexity of the levels or any impossible enemy. No, the levels are fairly simple by design and the enemies are slow and dumb. So, where's the problem. The problem is in the controlls. For example, you cannot change the direction of your jump and that is your biggest enemy, They made some things right in this game, but left many others (I presume intentionally) broken. On top of that they designed the levels to benefit exactly from your impediments which is extremely cheap.\n\nAnd the worst thing - the dealbreaker - is the save system, or the lack of one such. The game consists of 5 levels (a sixth level and some bonus/secret stuff is also there, but this is the main thing). Each level is split in two parts and has a boss fight at the end. Listen closely! Whenever you die you resurect at the beginning of the part of the level you died in. The second part includes the boss as well. So, given that the bosses are based on patterns (at least those I saw before I abandoned the game) you will need to die at least a few times so you know what to do. Each time you die you must go through the whole second part of the level! You accidently jumped at the wrong direction and cannot turn back mid-jump? Back at the beginning! This accumulates a lot of game time for nothing and this precious game time can be spent in other, more awarding games.\n\nSadly, I don't recommend this game to anyone except some REALLY hardcore overachieving complitionists. For God's sake, the game has GUI timers for fast runs, as if the game is famous for the skill you can gain...","May 7, 2015","false","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Think Castlevania 1 or 3.\n\nThe distinguishing feature of this game is that it's pretty difficult due to some unusual, unforgiving design choices. For starters, you have no horizontal air control at all, like the old Castlevanias, though you have a double jump. There is also a surprising amount of recovery after landing a jump. In addition, you die after only 1-3 hits, and getting hit causes you to lose an entire tier of power-ups.\n\nThe problem I have with the game is that it doesn't seem difficult in a particularly fun way. For example, at the very beginning you're going to die a ton just learning what you can block, enemy behavior, how to space jumps, and how to deal with enemies coming from above and below you. There's no real tutorial level to teach you the basics, which just means you're going to die a lot.\n\nOn top of that, the health system is really brutal. The game basically rewards you hugely for playing perfectly by giving you a way better weapon and better defense, but as soon as you take any 1 hit you lose that advantage. It's a weird system, because the game essentially becomes harder the less good you are the game. If you're really good and can play levels perfectly, you'll coast along with a weapon that does double damage with extra range, better blocking, and which is faster, along with the buffer health. If you're imperfect, you have to make do with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ weapons/blocking.\n\nOn top of all that, it's a very slow game, that's very low on improvization or surprises. Everything is very predictable, and the game moves at such a deliberate pace that it's principally a memorization/timing challenge.\n\nThere are some cool moments in the levels, and the graphics have a really nice aesthetic, but it's just not a very fun game to play. It's very much a game about perfectionism, and it's just not really very fun to learn. I'm actually a big fan of the old, hard platformer castlevanias, and 2d action-platformers in general, but this game is just not a particularly good example of the genre.","May 7, 2015","false","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Get wrecked - Get the ♥♥♥♥ back to beginning of stage).\n\nWith knowing that, it should be self-explanatory that this game can be frustrating! It has a steep learning-curve, and the game itself will simply point out the basic controls. After that you are on your own to stumble like a peasant into the grim world of Volgarr the Viking. The first couple of hours you will be fine starting over again and again, because it forces you to pick up on the intricate combinations of movement and attack one can pull off in the game. That being said, for the average player and for the greater part of these two hours, this will likely simply lead you to die in new ways on the same obstacles!\n\nSo why play it? Well the game is so well-designed, the graphics so beautiful, the "feel" you get from chopping up bad-guys is so great and the music is so powerful and grim, that it feels like the game is entitled to be this hardcore. The combat mechanism is fluid in the sense that you can pull off insane combinations (I know so because I have seen it on youtube) but movement-wise, the game is quite conservative. There is no air-control (except you can start jumping left or right, and then with a second jump choose to stand-still in the air, or vica-verca) however you can do things like: Jump, throw a spear, swirlattack with an extra jump, throw another spear and drop down, sword first into an enemy.\n\nAn interesting mechanism to note too, and might perhaps be a motivator for new players, is that as you get better, you will get better equipment and weapons, making the game easier. Once you get moves into your fingers so you run with the adrenaline, rather than freezing at every enemy and getting cold-feet about progressing, the game will also become easier. I think this is a great mechanism - the learning curve is seriously steep, but once you climb the mountain, you'll truly be able to reap its' rewards!\n\nYou might say that I'm ineligible to review this game  after only two hours ingame time, but to tell you the truth, two hours is probably the amount of time most players will be willing to spend on this game, failing miserably and then not returning out of sheer frustration. Also, I have spent the same amount of time looking at videos and reading guides on the game.\n\nWith that said, for the hardcore gamers that is just dying for a REAL challenge, I do recommend it! For more average players I only recommend it if you are ready for a huge challenge, and you have ambitions to becomea hardcore gamer - none will dispute that if you can run this game!","May 24, 2015","true","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
