Black cracks in the graphics due to not enough masking pixels on the edges of the sprites.  I loved Lemmings, think I played all the way through it way back when.  I'd really like to recommend this as it's similar and I like the ninja theme.  Right now it's a bit too frustrating.  A few little fixes and this could be great!  Thumb sideways?!","July 23, 2015","false","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","6"
