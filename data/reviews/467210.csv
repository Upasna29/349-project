The puzzles (so far - world 4) are relatively easy and aren't fustrating to figure out. But it is still fun, it isn't boringly easy. It's tricky enough to provide some relaxed entertainment, great game for the price as well. Also the main robot guy is super cute and there is a little story that goes on to.\n\nThe only annoying part is the tutorial/guide goes on a little to long. I thought it was going to go on for the whole game, which thankfully it didn't. I don't click anything for 3 seconds and it starts showing me what to do. Telling you where to click for an entire level was off putting beause I just wanted to figure it out myself.","May 16","true","0.7"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","1"

It uses geometry as puzzles to really make for some beautiful moments. Beautiful images and music, simple gameplay but very fun and never frustrating. Fast to finish for a good puzzle solver. Hope there will be more like this from this developer. I recommend this game fully. Just buy it now :D","May 16","true","2.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

Its like navigating around an MC Escher drawing that you can rotate and manipulate. It is very much like Monument Valley for Android or iOS. I really enjoyed that game and played through all the available levels they put out. Finally I get a similar game play and aesthetic from this game with some new twists. Definitely worth the 2 dollars.","May 16","true","1.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Unsure how many levels are in the game. I plan on beating the game here soon. Still, for $2.00 CAD, I don't see how you could lose on it. Simple graphics, and just clean gameplay.\n\nPick it up. Enjoy it.

Then don't miss this game. It's well executed, challenging, looks lovely and plays well. The optical illusions and secrets are well done. With over 40 levels and an absolutely low price, this game is a great break from the usual genres. My verdict.... a 10 out of 10 without a doubt.\n\nHoud je van Escher of puzzel spellen in een leuke spelomgeving? Mis dan dit spel niet. Het is erg goed gemaakt, uitdagend, ziet er leuk uit en speelt prima. De optische illusies en geheimen zijn mooi gedaan. Met ruim 40 levels en een absoluut lage prijs is dit spel een goede afwisseling van de gewoonlijke genres. Mijn oordeel..... zonder twijfel een 10 uit 10.","May 18","true","1.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/StupidName/recommended/467210/","StupidName","SuperJer [Linux "Hipster"]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/StupidName/","453 products in account","Not bad.\n\nThis game claims to be inspired by 'Monument Valley', but it's difficult to say that it is like M.V.  It's easier to say that it kinda rips off M.V. in many ways, but with much less 'Escher'.  There are a few unique ideas, but most folks will be marching right through the puzzles in no time, with very few hangups.  My play time of 1.3 hours included beating it plus folding 3 loads of laundry.\n\nIs it worth the 2 bucks?  I think so.  Is it spectacular?  No, it's 2 bucks.","June 1","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
