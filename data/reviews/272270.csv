For good or ill, this is not PS:T 2. Without Avellone, there is a noticeable shift in writing and the setting itself greatly differs from Planescape. I had worried that it would be a pale imitation, a weak creation that mimics but does not understand what made Planescape: Torment so great.\n\nI was wrong. I am not very far in the game, but after having talked to many NPCs and finished several quests, I feel like I have a good gauge of Tides of Numenera.\n\n1. The writing is superb. I still miss Avellone, but the new writers raise many interesting questions about legacy, always finding a new unusual facet to explore and introduce you to. It's not a shallow game, which comes as a great relief to me.\n\n2. The choices are introspective. The game not only asks what you would do, but why and how? It is very refreshing to be asked to ponder on my motives, especially compared to Pillars of Eternity, whose choices took a more results and action oriented view.\n\n3. The gameplay and combat looks promising. I can't say more, as the game is yet unbalanced and I only experienced 2 crisises yet.\n\n4. Bugs and lack of optimization. Currently, the game lags pretty hard 3-year old gaming laptop. The loading times are exruciating. Smaller levels need 3-5 minutes, the big marketplace requires whole 10-15 minutes.\n\nOverall, I recommend the game, but only buy it right now if you have either an extremely powerful PC or a lot of patience for the loading times. I had the patience, but doubt that many other people will.","January 26","true","8.8"," 243 of 274 people (89%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","89","243","274","7","22"

Best thing about it is that pretty much every single bit of dialogue is well written and all of the characters have some sort of compelling story to tell, if you can get them to share it.\n\nFor example there's a cannibalistic cult that lives in the depths of the city and rather than the usual RPG business of having you kill them Torment actually managed to convince me to not just leave them alone but concede that they might have a good point...\n\nHowever, while the story really is amazing, possibly just as good or even better than Planescape: Torment's the combat, graphics and performance still need a lot of work done to them.\n\nThe combat right now is best described as generic low-level DND combat with the one big difference being the various items and background objects you can use (the titular Numenera) if you have either the necessary skill or knowledge to activate them without blowing yourself up in the process. I'm guessing things will become a whole lot more interesting once you get a few more abilities under your belt but since you're mostly stuck as a low level character during the beta it was fairly meek.\n\nThe performance is also a bit of a sore spot. Its not uncommon to have your game freeze for a couple of seconds mid combat or while interacting with particularly complex background objects or even when simply accessing your inventory or any menu besides the dialogue one.\n\nIn other words, while Torment has an amazing story that's well worth exploring, it is still very much so a beta and as such I'd recommend you buy it either because you want to support the developers or because you want to soak in the story. Just don't buy it expecting a finished game because it most certainly isn't one just yet.\n\nI've also done a video where I go far more in-depth about Torment so if you're looking for more info I welcome you to take a look:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUeddmTS_3k","January 26","true","10.3"," 93 of 110 people (85%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","85","93","110","4","3"

It really feels like it's coming from where it claims it's coming (or something like that). Moreover, this fantastic universe of weird stuff and strange people is taken over by cool devs from a nice studio with the goal of reproducing the experience Planescape : Torment was while not forgetting to enhance it. So it's like a dinosaur of the oldschool rpg world but with a facelift, featuring a marvelous -but super weird- universe, dialogues where you can actually go pretty deep (not in all cases, but i don't care if i can't discuss the meaning of life with the guard patrolling the area), sceneries where you can actually feel the work which is provided by the devs, and a crisis system which is refreshing the good ol' pen'n'paper turn based system without disorienting the nostalgic ones, giving a sense of returning to the roots of the style which made some of us lovers of all this game can represent : a good videogame, a good adaptation of the pen and paper rpg Numenera, but also a great storytelling in which your choices feel decisive.\n\nPrepare yourself for tons and tons of dialogue though, so if it's not something you're searching for or if you simply think you'll not be able to stand it after a while, i would suggest you to go your own way on another wonderful steam page !\n\nPS :\nEarly access is early (no ♥♥♥♥)\nGame is buggy\nSpaghetti","January 26","true","23.7"," 108 of 135 people (80%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","80","108","135","9","8"

I am an old school Planescape: Torment fan, and a D&D tabletop player/DM. Let's set a few things straight about this game:\n1) Best Writing Ever! Amazing story, characters and settings with personalities of their own.\n2) Uniquely awe-inspiring environments with unforgettable experiences around every corner.\n3) A massive project filled with love, both from the Devs and the Fans!\n4) The Spiritual Successor to Planescape: Torment, and I could not be any prouder!\n5) Just to clarify: This is not D&D, nor is it technically part of the D&D universe... but it's also technically could be, in a way. Afterall, Planescape: Torment took place in Sigil, and that city could take you anywhere in the universe... I wish not to debate meta/universe lines or copyrights, so I will just leave it as that. No it doesn't explicitly have any connection to the previous game, but the feel, wonderful bizarrities and incredible writing feel right at home.\n\nThus far, the game has been amazing. It has the updated graphics and sounds (plus voice acting!) that were needed to drive the series forward. Planescape: Torment is held dear to the hearts of many, and this game shall not disappoint! 12/10 Can't wait for the full release!\n\nIf only it weren't so late... I want to play FOREVER!\nP.S. The in game bug-reporting system is great! I need to make a torment account, but I will surely be giving useful information to help squash bugs before release. I have only had one bug at the beginning, one of my guys couldn't move during combat. I hit the space bar or something to skip the turn and it fixed it. Didn't cause a major issue.","January 26","true","11.2"," 72 of 83 people (87%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","87","72","83","3","11"

Seriously, I don't want people getting in to this game and then be disappointed in the performance/bugs and give a negative review. Just wait until it's finished.\n\nSECOND: This is a cross between a western "CRPG" and a "novel", or as close you'll ever get to. And the writing is great, just so you know. I cannot emphasise this enough: You need to like to read, and you need to be fluent in English to enjoy this game. At least until the promised translations come with the full release.\n\nHOWEVER, if you want to guide the developement with feedback and reporting the bugs, this is the game to do it. I don't think I've ever seen quite so convenient way to bug-report/give feedback on any game.\n\n---\n\nSo, as long as you can live with the atrocious performance, and completely ad hoc unfinished UI that ranges from "old school" to "fugly", and is unfinished as all get out, you can help to guide the developement of the game quite a lot.\n\nI've played the game only sparingly, but giving feedback (via the humongous feedback button that's always available) as needed to this game. They had some issues with higher solutions, for starters.\n\nThe prose is ever present, and if you thought "Pillars of Eternity" had a lot of reading you haven't seen anything. The world is pretty amazing and surreal, and fits really well in to the the continuum of the "Torment" games. The graphics are pretty good, and the surreal nature of the world really, really works for me. I think it's the best parts of the Planescape with a nice modern touch.\n\nI am very excited for this game's eventual release. Right now I am just giving feedback to help out the devs, but if that's not your cup of tea, then don't bother, just wait for the final release.","February 5","true","4.5"," 35 of 40 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","35","40","0","0"

There's quite a few bugs, it's not very stable even with high end computers, and you can tell there's some basic features that haven't been implemented. Thankfully, this build of the game has a convenient and ever present feedback button that makes reporting the bugs and other issues much easier.\n\nSecond, in spite of that knowledge, I'd like to recommend opting into the beta because this game is just that promising. It's still too soon to say with any certainty if this game will be just a good game or a great game, but I will say that what I have seen is special. Everything from the setting to the writing to the mechanics is just brimming with potential, and even with the game only being partially realized I can say that it is worth checking out and that you should keep your expectations high.","January 28","true","48.9"," 32 of 39 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","32","39","0","0"

Before you hover images, passing in rapid sequence, but conveying a comforting sense of the entirety of a whole.  You sift through their details - an odd protuberance in an unexpected place, a comforting voice passing through the air behind you - and ponder.  While you draw no closer to these images physically, your mind and will are progressively and inexorably more deeply involved in the events you observe, these same events you even direct, to some extent.  You notice that, in reflections of reflections, you weigh heavy questions.  They pass through lesser used corridors in your mind, and prompt at once both introspection and alarm.  You realize then that you just spent the greater part of an afternoon, and the equivalent of the price of a quality meal for two, on a simulacrum, still in its fledgling state, of worlds only known to a glimmering few, and you yearn to know - to feel - more.\n\nIf you've read this far, congratulations.  You'll see more like this, lots more, as you wade, wander, and weigh your options through this newest world of Torment.\n\nAfter starting over twice, and a good, what, 30 hours at this point?  I finally found an in-canon expositor who at least helped me, the human playing this game, understand that numenera is a plural noun indicating objects, not a singular proper noun indicating a place.  I know what two of the five tides regard, and my latest protagonist is happily balanced among all of them.\n\n[Edit] So, I am apparently a ponderously slow exploratory player, and I'm okay with that.  I do believe the reason the series is named Torment is because it's (almost) impossible to die.  That seems fitting, for someone who took almost 50 hours to get through the beta.  Pro tip: don't leave town.\n\nHaving resolved 16-odd quests, and with 2 remaining, now I'm seriously jonesing to get on with the rest of this.  I can only guess that, as a secret-finder and prose-reader (I really LIKE the Meres!), I'll probably lose ~200 hours of my life in this game.  I can't wait for the hideous stench of the Bloom to fill my nostrils... ugh, wait, maybe I can? [/edit]\n\nHighly recommended for your Bartle's exploratory types!  Feel free to look elsewhere for bullet-time, spraying gibs, skimpy outfits, collisions, porridge, wanton violence or wontons.  You're on earth, a billion years in the future, and you've got all the time in the world to read through tomes of narrative, linking slender chains in your mind, piecing together yourself, and all the whys of all the voids, within and without.\n\nGrand.

That said, it was still very playable and enjoyable.  What really struck me about the game was the sense of otherness that the main city oozed out of each and every one of its pores.  Even after investigation I don't know what half of the ancient machines that scatter the city do, but they're all beautiful and intriguing.\n\nRemember those question based character creation segments in a lot of older RPGs?  Well this game found a way to take that concept and make it not suck.  Basically how you solve the games initial set of problems determines your class and early stats in a way that feels organic.  You're literally discovering yourelf.  Don't worry, though, if you don't like the results, you get a chance to change them to what you want to play before jumping into the game world proper.\n\nI don't have a solid review of the game's combat, because I didn't really fight anyone per se.  I wanted to see if you could solve everything without dealing a single HP of damage, and for everything I stumbled upon that was an option!\n\nThe strongest point of the beta is probably the writing.

First, I died before I could even start the game. How? In an awesome way, but I won't give you spoilers. I just say that I was too "eager to throw myself away". And that's one big lead to let you know how unpredictable is the scenario of this game.\n\nSince the first lines of the narration, you`re already choosing your destiny and changing whatever you don't know you're going to change, and that's simply terrifying and gratifying at the same time. About the "Planescape: Torment premise", well, I might say the whole package is all in it, even if many thing are not implemented and "well developed" yet, you can "feel" it`s all there.  I can give a couple of examples from what I`ve already experienced: alien-ish and complete freakish ambientation, great character development, "things" so bizarre simply apread all over places for you to interact and figure (what the hell) is it about, dense and metaphysical dialogues that give you the creeps and "haunt" your decision-making. Aside of that, you're simply thrown into the world without knowledge or making sense of anything. It's strange.

In short Torment is isometric cRPG. The game aims more for reactivity, choices, replayability and story telling than other RPGs. This game is successor to Planescape Torment which was released 1999. According to wikipedia, PST has been pretty frequently rewarded after year 2000. For example, 2008 IGN listed this as n. 8/10 franchises that should be resurrected, praising game for having "best writing and characterization seen in gaming". Planescape has also been frequently listed top xx all games ever done and to play, last of them being PC Gamer stating 2011 Planescape Torment being 19th greatest PC game ever done. Clearly, there's a huge demand for this successor.\n\nBackground of Torment: Team behind the game is more or less "all star" group, having been part of creating following titles: The Bard's Tale series, Wasteland 1 & 2, Fallout 1 & 2, Baldur's Gate, Planescape: Torment, IWD 1&2 and NWN2 expansions. (Well, Avellone left before change of year 2016 ) Also, creator of Numenera setting is involved with project as well. Mark Morgan (Fallout 1,2,NV, Planescape etc.) is composing music for Torment. The game raised 4 million USD in Kickstarter, later increrasing the amount to 5 million and it's still growing. As far as I know, this is currently a world record for a Kickstarter project related to games. The game has already delayed like one year and will be released this year, propably after summer? If I remember correct, Kickstarter was was chosen as a method to fund the game to get rid of some problems gaming industry does for developing of games.\n\nSo, a lot of promises, expections, hopes and doubts. Lets see what first version of Beta seems to provide us so far and what kind of thoughts it delivers to me:\n\n- Torment is clearly closest to Planescape, just like developers have said. There's a lot of text to read and it is written really well and the use of words is colourful, really making your imagination running. The languange however is not anything simple, which might become problem for people who dont speak English as first languange or have fluent English otherwise. (For this, before buying, I would recommend to check Let's Play videos or something where you can see a bit of it). Dev has mentioned that this game will have about equal amount of words than Planescape had or possibly even more. (Devs have however stated that the game will be translated into: French, German, Italian, Polish, Russian and Spanish during early access.)\n\n- Reactivity seems to play big part of the quests and world in the game. Quests seem to have multiple solutions, starting from not even taking the quest, ignoring after taking it and other solutions where you do something. Naturally, you can't solve quests in all different ways in one playthrough. 5 dimensional tide system also seems to provide replayability as they do different things for the world. You even have different prologue parts before waking up in the world of Torment. Choices in game also shifts these tides as well and might cause NPC's in world to react in different ways etc. I havent investigated this  tide thing yet.\n\n- First version of beta is buggy: Developers ask for feedback in the forum or via the feedback system provided in the game. It's nice to see that developers are actually reading the forum and recommendations, suggestions and other ideas of people in the forum, also commenting them occasionally. (To make it clear they dont do what people tell them to do, they just take the best parts or ideas that suit for their vision of the game). Also, they havent developed f.e. stores, proper UI or many items for it. I'm sure that the combat system will get some tweaks as well.\n\n- Setting: Numenera is odd world for a person who is not familiar with the setting before playing this. That's why the lore might feel a bit crushing at the start, but if you look around and do things, you get more familiar with it in short time. In short it's scifi world but has a touch of more usual cRPG aspects, which makes you feel more like in home if you are familiar with genre. There's a lot of advanced technology, but knowledge and how odd devices and such are used is limited. I'm not explaining theme more here, but there's a lot to wonder and be curious about (like a fountain of purple fishes flowing instead of water?)\n\n\nOverall: I think the game seems really promising so far. I'm curious about what I will learn about Numenera, the story, characters etc and what kind of choices can I make. I hope the full game will show more strong philosophical aspects as well (like PST did), which, at least the question "What does one life matter?" seems to be hinting about. I also got now and then Point And Click feeling :D Also, I havent had problems with performance of the game (other than first area). If you would like to see all different outcomes of quests etc. I would say playing this beta could be like 40 hour thing to play. Otherwise it's about +10 hours.\n\n\nThis game seems to be for: People who want to read (a lot) and think, diving into atmosphere and environment of Numenera with their imagination. People who enjoy cRPG titles, especially Planescape: Torment. People who don't mind that you can't archive everything in one playthrough. People who enjoy traditional, narrative roleplaying things, pnp and such. (However, dont expect and hope that this game is Planescape Torment 2 - Successor means that the heart of PST is there in terms of writing, reactivity etc. but the game's setting, rules etc have nothing to do with PST..)\n\nThis game is not for: People who dont speak fluent English. People who expect more fast paced gaming and action. Also, people who find idea of reading a book horrible. People who think that fighting in RPG is mandatory rather than one possibility among others.\n\nGood thing is that this game will also be released DRM free.","January 30","true","13.2"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","0"

Wonderful writing for the dialogue\n2. Nice art design\n3. Has the Planscape Torment vibe and atmosphere that we loved from the old one\n\nNo this is not a direct sequel to Planscape Torment, but it has some the people working on it who worked on the old Planscape Torment (which is imo one of the greatest rpgs ever and the best writing ever in a videogame).\n\nSo this game has alot to live up to, but so far it is on track to become a classic crpg. It is fun to play and so far the dialogue is very interesting. Also its good to see that you can skip out on some of the combat still.\n\nOnly have little over 2 hours on the game so far but I am very impressed. I liked the new crpgs like Divinity Original Sin, Wasteland 2 and Pillars of Eternity that have come from Kickstarter and this new Torment is no different. A little rough around the edges but sooo much to love!\n\nIf you liked the resurgence of crpgs the last few years, check this one out! It is still being wokred on and the full game is not finished yet, but what is here now is a wonderful taste of whats to come. Chris Avellone was also helping with the writing for this game, so if you liked his writing on Planscape Torment, Alpha Protocol, KOTOR2 or Fallut New vegas, check this one out!\n\nThe only real negatives I have atm, for a beta like this is that the controls need some work, its a little slow/clunky/unresponsive when you move around and sometimes you get stuck on elements of the game world sometimes. The UI needs alot of work and there are a hand full of bugs as expected. Still, these are a few issues that don't ruin the game and that I am sure will be improved/fixed while the game is being made and when it hits full release, as other crpgs in early access have done in the past (Pillars, Wasteland 2, Divinity,etc..). So far it is a great start though I must say!\n\nWe have more Torment people! And it is so far so good! Time to celebrate!!! I will update this review as more updates and content comes out and as I spend more time with it. So far though, the good FAR outweighs the bad! If you love reading high quality dialogue and story stuff, pick this up asap. If you like Inexile games pick this up... if you liked Planscape Torment pick this up! If you want to wait till its 100% done by all means join in the party later. But so far for a early beta of an rpg it is good and has a ton of potential when the full came is released. Some of the best writing around already, can only imagine the full game.","January 26","true","3.7"," 21 of 30 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","21","30","0","4"

All I wanna say: I'm very impatient for the moment this game will be released. Whoever liked Planescape will be pleasantly surprised by the diversity of choises you can make. Also I'd like to tell that after 15+ years of wait...it was totally worth it.\n\nPros:\n+The context dialogues consist of 10+ options and all your choises lead to some kind of consiquences that differ one from another!\n+A decent storyline, which kinda reminds of Planescape, when you dunno who are you, what happened to you and someone is after you.\n+Pleasant graphics which also remind of good old times spent in Planescape.\n+Soundtrack.\n+Atmosphere.\n+Easter eggs!

The graphic choice is much cleaner and crisp, as well as having way more sci-fi elements present. Combat flows much smoother and the animated worlds are beautiful, choices as always, have a big impact on how the story unfolds and trying to make your character out to be a "Jack of all trades" but "master of none" is definitely not advised, as it would make certain situations quite difficult.

The settings, writing and characters were all rich in detail.\nI am happy to say that, so far, TToN is shaping up to also be a masterpiece to be remembered.\n\nAt first the settings will seem alien to you and you'll feel slightly confused, but gradually everything will make sense if you open your mind to concepts that would otherwise seem impossible to comprehend under normal circumstances.\nYou'll end up wanting to explore every corner of every area, finding secrets, speaking to the locals or simply examining strange, otherwordly technology in the hopes to gain some sort of advantage through them.\n\nMany of the quests will not give you a sense of what is the right and what is the wrong decision, leaving it up to you to decide what the best course of action is based entirely on your personal interpretation and opinion and even then you might be wondering "was that truly the best choice there was?"\nAn example containing spoilers: At some stage you will find a creature in a bar, lamenting the fact that he lost contact to the rest of his civilization, whose purpose it was to guide others. The most obvious choice would be to use your powers to rid his mind of the sadness enveloping his thoughts. After you do so his sadness turns into cold determination as he sets out, not to guide people, but to dictate over their lives with an iron fist. (Or that is how I interpreted the turn of events. Correct me if I'm wrong.)\n\nWould I recommend the game as it is now? Yes, if you can accept the fact that it is not finished, but you want a glimpse of what is to come.

Becuase my save file corrupted with a new patch and I wanted to not spoil the rest for myself. Despite this I loved every second of what little I played and what I saw was VERY promising. Despite playing it I never really finished Planescape Torment, though I did like it. I should go back and try to finish it before this comes out, despite this it has alot of what I love about it.\n\nIt has well written wordy dialogue that actually flows well instead of being a chore to read and a REALLY interesting world. Trust me when I say you have never seen a game world quite like this. I also like how combat is less of a focus and when it is there the encounters are well thought out and complex. While the 3D models may not be the greatest looking things in the world they are servicable and the handcrafted backgrounds are amazing.\n\nAs of right now however the game is poorly optimized, buggy, has ugly UI and is unfinished. I reccomend waiting till release if you want to play this game and just wishlisting for now. HOWEVER if you want to support the development and want to play it early then buy it now. The price is definitley steep but overall you are garunteed a product that will be finished within this year at most and thats not something you can say about a lot of indie games.\n\nBETA RATING: B+","March 5","true","4.3"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

Conclusion\nI'm not a native speaker, but I like reading English novels. I loved every piece of the stories in the game, and actually, quality of the stories was the only thing that made me keep playing this game. However, if I had wanted just good readings, I would have bought a book.\n\nEvery feature in this game is not that desirable except stories, and if I have to point out things, I think I should talk about  2.animation  3.combat  4.voice acting. I saw some people saying that this is a story-driven game and the other things are not needed, but this is not 'Planescape: Torment' in 1999. If an essential feature of the game can be developed as a firm structure, and it can enrich the whole game without hurting or shortening stories, I don't see any reason to prevent it.\n\n\n\n1. Story\nFor people who like reading novels - (10/10)\nFor people who don't like or are not familiar with reading - (5/10)\nIf you like reading books, you'll be satisfied just for good stories. I like novels, movies, and TV shows which focuses on sophisticated stories, and I haven't seen any stories like T:TON. Describing the stories of this game with my sloppy words will only debase the true value of it because there are not many writers who can describe 'a world unlike any other' better than this team. So here's an example of the stories in the game, some words from a person whom you get to meet in the game.\n\n"A spoken lie lasts but a breath, and those who hear it can answer with the truth. But a written lie lingers long past the lives of those who know it to be false. enduring until it can lead a whole race astray."\n\nHowever, I think not everyone will like this game because it contains too many reading materials. It was hard to read all these vast amounts of texts, and it was much harder than 'Pillars of Eternity'. Actually, You'll have to spend 85% of your time for reading, and 95% if you choose to avoid or resolve the crisis(combat). In my case, I liked it cause I liked those stories, but I think it could be a huge threshold for those who don't like or are not familiar with reading.\n\n\n\n2. Animation (6/10)\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=612249719\n1) silver of mirror : a red line comes out.\n2) side mirror : A torrent of golden light flows through you.\n3) oval mirror : The pulsing blue star expands as you watch. Pale clouds of blue light surround your heads.\n4) center mirror : it shows your unaltered reflection, the crease between your eyebrows.\n\nWhen I was choosing each action, I expected they would show me some animations, or at least some glow on each mirror. However, all I could see during the whole sequence was the exact same static picture without any changes or movements. It's basically a picture book which I have to read multiple pages of scripts separately. It doesn't feel like a real world. I'm not saying they have to make some fabulous fantastic actions. Is it really that hard to make one bit of red or blue shining line, or at least some glow? I can't imagine that devs are somehow apathetic or lazy. This scene really made me think if there had been anything wrong with development progress.\n\nThis is just one example of many things. I couldn't see any animations when 'the clock mission' started, and 'master foreman'(enormous robot) didn't even blink even when I was talking to him(But he was still talking and shouting). If it is a really hard part and can't be changed technically, I can accept that. But small effects in the important scene can't be hard and can't hurt stories. I can't understand why they didn't do anything about them.\n\nI don't think these issues are just some minor bugs or mistakes. If devs don't change their whole perspective, we'll have to read scripts on the lifeless and static picture book for most of the time.\n\n\n3. Combat (7/10)\nAs you all know, 'Wasteland 2' and 'Divinity: Original Sin' had similar combat system. For instance, if you have 12 action points in 1 turn, you get to move(2pt), heal/buff/debuff(3pt), attack(5pt) and spare 2 points. In T:TON, simply put, you can use only 1 action(use item/skill/attack) and 1 move in 1 turn. Combats actually work like this.\n\n[Initiative]\nEnemy1 > Enemy2 > Team1 > Team2 > Enemy3 > Team3\n\nTURN 1→        E1 Attack        E2 Attack        T1 Attack        T2 Attack        E3 Attack        T3 Attack        →E3 Dies                TURN 2→        E1 Attack        E2 Attack        T1 Attack        T2 Attack                         T3 Attack        →E2 Dies                TURN 3→        E1 Attack                T1 Attack        T2 Attack                T3 Attack        →E1 Dies\n\nThe reason I didn't include moving is because it doesn't actually matter in combat. First, cost and benefit(distance) of the moving is fixed. Second, moving rarely affects to the attacks because it has fixed cost. Third, moving is not about strategic decision making in the field, rather about choosing whom I will attack on this turn, like a card game. If you want to hit enemyX, you can just go to X and hit X, and there're no limits or disengagements or anything. Forth, I've tried many combats by using several saving files, so I can assure you that the enemies are not that smart. There's nothing special you can strategically gain from moving. In conclusion, It's basically not different from typical card games.\n\nAt first, I thought 'sacrificing stats to increase hit chance and damage' was a brilliant idea. However, since maintaining stats are not that hard, it doesn't actually matter that much, at least for now. There are some alternative options like intimidation, persuasion, or using numenera, but they're nothing but another type of attacks. Some could say it's inevitable cause it's based on the board game Numenera, but they were monotonous and tedious combats for me anyway.\n\nI simplified many things for the explanation, but it's not that different from the big picture. I don't think little tweaks could fix this matter.\n\n\n\n4. Voice Acting (?/10)\nI think voice acting is important in animation movies and games. Think about any animation movie and imagine that you have to watch it without any voices. I always couldn't understand why they don't put voices in RPG. Funny thing is, they always show us an advertisement with voice actors performing their breathtaking lines, but in actual games, we can't hear anything on 80~90% of the scripts. I don't know much about voice actors, but even Youtubers make videos of full voice version. When I heard they raised over 5,000k, first thing got in my mind was a little hope that devs could show us full voice version of Torment. But I couldn't hear any signs or promises yet.\n\n\n[Pros]1. Vast amounts of good stories, if you like reading novels. (10/10)\n[Cons]1. Vast amounts of good stories, if you don't like or are not familiar with reading. (5/10)\n2. Lack of animations on the important scenes. (6/10)\n3. Combats are too simple. fundamentally similar to a card game. (7/10)\n4. Lack of voice actors, at least for now. and couldn't see any promises. (?/10)\n\n\n(My first review was a horrible gibberish, and I understand why so many people were angry about my review. I admit everything you said. I'm a system breaking illogical dishonest faggXt hipster who is also  a stupid idiot. However, this time I've done my best to arrange my thoughts and to provide information. I don't expect everyone would agree with me or like my thoughts, but I wish this could help a person who comes next. )","January 31","false","38.6"," 351 of 657 people (53%) found this review helpful 41 people found this review funny","53","351","657","41","28"

Sure, it isn't optimized and it does have its bugs and CTDs but nothing like the junk I heard from other reviewers.  It plays pretty much just like its predecessor.  I mean, it is like I am playing Torment with different people and a different story.  It could almost be a sequel it is so similar.  It is like it was made not long after its namesake.  There is combat.  Combat like there was in torment.  I am not sure what or where this 'conversation combat' or 'no  real combat' stance came from but it is completely wrong.  I encountered combat after the first real area I had left.  The game reeks of the old Torment and that is enough to hook me.  The lore is deep and confusing and everything begs to be examined.  If you are not into that, too bad, that's what Torment was all about.\n\nI have only played a few hours and will update this review as I go along.  There was just some pressing issues that needed to be addressed.  Namely the lack of combat foolishness.  This is just not true.  There is combat.","February 13","true","3.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The writing is top-notch, and it really brought back those times when an RPG game really puts you in the shoes of your character. The amount of lore, the presence of literary power, and philosophical queries places this game in my list of video games as gesamntkunstwerk (total art), as an experience. Truly, the developers are one of those legendary people who are sent to this world to create these type of games.\n\nThe game has its performance issues, of course, since it is still on Early Access. A load of bugs, optimization issues, and in my case, I experience tons of lag especially in the beginning of the game. Hopefully, the developers will do work on these issues and I wish them luck on that.\n\nTo sum up, this is the type of game you should buy and play because it immerses you into a world that is merely a reflection of our own. The decisions of the Last Castoff are refractions of your decisions in your own life. I think video games (open-ended/open-world RPG's in particular [tho T:ToN is more open-ended]) are an existential commodity that serves as a prism to our own experiences in life. And with the emergence of games like Torment: Tides of Numenera, I think its players will get to answer questions about individuality, the weight of their choices in this tapestry of life, and most importantly, they will get a glimpse of the essence of their existence.","February 26","true","6.9"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

The concept is great and I like where it is going, but in it's current state... Wait until it is further along unless you are seriously looking to provide feedback.  Here are my biggest gripes so far:\n\n-The horrendously long beginning sequence just needs to be dropped alltogether.  I understand what the devs where going for here, but it falls flat, and made me almost not even give the game a chance.  Far too heavy on expostion, that even now (about 15  hours into the game) has not ONCE been referenced in any way.  In essence, it all feels like meaningless filler, all the while, I'm like, "When the hell do I finish creating my character and START the damn game already?!"  It really seems more like the devs mean to wow people with how outlandish the lifeforms and ideas in the world are, which is great, I'm all about weird and different, but it doesn't seem relevant and throws WAY too much info at the player too fast.  Two hours or so later and I'm talking to the first two companions and I was wondering why they didn't start the game at that point.  It would be, IHMO, ten times more expedient and exciting that way.\n\n-Bugs and lack of optimization galore; my new gaming rig is less than two months old and is getting playstation-era loadtimes... Several times, the map extended beyond the GUI boundaries, sometimes menus can't be opened at all or the character stops responding to mouse clicks, requiring a re-load, sometimes even a complete reboot of the game.  NPCs keep telling me to do quests that have already been finished.  Like, after freeing a man from exectution, one of my companions warns me every time I sleep that the man will be killed soon.  Or, after completing another quest, the journal tells me to report to the person I already reported to.  Or, being told that there is a NEW murder that happened this night, then being told the details of an earlier murder which we already discussed in detail.  Ugh...\n\n-Your character receives negative buffs (fettles) when you pick up cyphers, but since you cannot (yet) sell items, the "quest rewards" actually gimp your character as they keep stacking and making your character LESS able to perform skills.  Granted, this will be fixed to a degree as the vendors are incorporated into the game, but for now, it means I just have a desire to junk all of the cyphers I pick up.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I think there is insane POTENTIAL for this game.  I loved Planescape: Torment and the previous work of this team and have a lot of faith in them.  The game just isn't there YET.  I'm sure that a few months down the line, I'll be able to give a more polished game the thumbs up.","January 28","false","13.4"," 65 of 130 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","65","130","2","18"

Buy it.\n\nThey may have gone a bit overboard with too much of fantastic numenera from 9 ages all in one place, all fantastical and crazy stuff is right next to techno-wrecks on the starting map, and its all piled on top of each other, its like walking in the middle of a caleidoscope, or in someone's acid-fuelled dream. Maybe a bit too much, overwhelms the senses. But i guess thats the whole point of the setting. But to me, Planescape Torment was a little less caleidoscopish - all areas were distinct, but they had their own unique style. In Numenera, its all jumbled together. Just weird.\n\nHaving said that, the early access is in my opinion, has been released waaay too early. Game is nowhere near finished, or even functional. As of february 1, only 1 chapter is availiable, half the graphics, UI, and game elements like merchants is not even in the game. And too many freezes, crashes, and hang-ups. Still months and months of work.\n\nSo, i would suggest, do yourself a favor, buy this game, and set it aside for a good few months.

The stories you read in this are fantastic, even though several of them are just little glimpses into different tales. At the very beginning, when defining the character, I couldn't stop myself from wishing that what I was reading was actually printed out as books. Let me tell you, I would read every one of them.\nThis game has held my interest from the second it started, and has continued to keep it. The quests that are given are extordinary and very interesting, and I've noticed that, even the smallest quest, hold the question of, 'what does one life matter?' It really, REALLY makes you ask yourself that multiple times.\nI'm extremely excited to see this game finished and be the full-blown awesomeness that it is.

So.\nThis is a Torment game.\nEnough said.\nBut saying that won't get me any upvotes so here have some actual effort.\nI honestly don't know if I'll add spoilers, so YOU WERE WARNED. I stilll haven't figured out how to do that nifty thing where the spoilers are blocked by a black bar and you can only see it by shadowing over it with a mouse.\nI bought the game thinking it would be like Baldur's Gate.\nI was pleasantly surprised.\nThe only way I can describe the combat gameplay is if Fire Emblem and Baldur's Gate had a mutant superbaby with steampunk hair.\nOutside of combat it plays pretty similar to Baldur's Gate.\nYou wander around and stuff, and there aren't any shops yet, so I can't describe those to you. I am hoping for something reminiscent of the shops that I remember playing Planescape, but I think no matter what I will be pleased, so it's no use asking them what the plan is. Half the fun of shopping is spending half an hour searching for the "buy" button before giving up and filing a complaint because the sprites for that button weren't included in the most recent update.\nAs I type this, I am waiting for my character to unglue himself from the wall. This game is glitchy as **** but it is early access and only one patch has been released, so that doesn't matter. What DOES matter is the beautiful visual effects. It feels modern but still gives me that shot of PURE, UNBRIDLED NOSALGIA every time we cast a spell. Er, use a cypher. I've been playing for a bit, and I still haven't completely figured out the rules.\nWARNING: IF YOU ARE PLANNING TO BUY THIS BECAUSE HERP DE DERP IT LOOKS LIKE BALDUR'S GATE, YOU ARE IN FOR AN UNPLEASANT SURPRISE.\nI went in thinking it would be Baldur's Gate III THE STEAMPUNK WIZARDS. I spent about fifteen minutes trying to move around before I remembered "Oh yeah, it isn't." It doesn't have one of those ANNOYING AS HELL unavoidable tutorial levels that teach you nothing because you just figure it out as you play after you go through the tutorial level. It took me three failures in the first combat encounter before I figured out how to use skills/spells/THE SPECTER CONE BLAST WHICH IS ABSOLUTE WAIFU.

My computer can barely run League Of Legends and it runs this rather smoothly.\nCons:\nNo tutorial or even any attempt to teach you how to play\nNot Baldur's Gate III. It is coming, my brothers and sisters, it is coming.\nDifficulty when reading certain bits, such as the part when you take control of the sick rich guy.

I love Numenera,  I loved the original Torment, and the small parts of this game that work show a lot of promise.\n\nThat said, the "game" is far too incomplete to get a recommendation at this time. It's at a very early alpha level of bugginess, such that all but the most patient of gamers will not be able to tolerate it. If you don't imagine yourself happily persevering after the fourth time you've crashed during character creation, you should probably wait a while before checking this game out.\n\nEven if you are prepared to save after every action and reload a lot, brace yourself for a shocking lack of content. You'll get a quest, head out for the dungeon, and then get a dialog telling you to imagine you just completed the quest. At the current state of development, the game is very thin.\n\nThese two complaints should be addressed as development progresses. One thing that won't change is that this game looks and plays like a game from 1999. Thats not a bad thing, it's just what a gamer like me wants, but it's not for everyone.\n\nThose complaints aside, I haven't returned it and continue to slog through it. Why? Because it's a great portrayal of the Numenera setting and system. Because the writing is top quality and the dialog trees are extensive. Because I suspect that I will love this game when it's done and don't want to wait for them to finish it.\n\nSo, if you're the kind of person who loves Planescape and plays in a weekly tabletop Numenera game, this title is worth a look. Otherwise, I'd keep my eye on the forums and pick it up when it's got a little more meat on it's bones.","January 31","false","64.9"," 32 of 68 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","32","68","0","0"

Calling me a troll, responding with utter nonsense and then insults. Those are protected and approved because they dont write any critiques about the beta. Nobody tells them they are trolls and lack "mutual respect" because they "love the game".\n\nThe same thing happened with Wasteland 2 and then those who were flinging all the garbage they could come up with (which was pathetic nonsensical diarrhea) at me - were given moderator positions on their forums.\n\nSo i guess the little newly employed pathetic community moderator - "developer" - whatever - whose personal mod for Dragon Age i also criticized for the exact same things as these two games, namely logical inconsistencies and incoherent plots, jumped into panic mode as soon as he saw my single post and rushed to ban me while inventing false accusations. I hope he got a pat on the shoulder for his loyal service.\n\nBefore i had a chance to write a post about some of the good things in this beta.\nHeight of intelligence and honesty as you can guess.\n\nIf you want to support such a company, feel free to pay this hugely overpriced beta. I overpaid both games a lot during their kickstarters and this is what i get for it.\n\nNo doubt the trolls will jump onto this to accuse me of "thinking i have special rights because i am a backer" , but in actual reality i only expected i will be able to provide some constructive critiques (which they all were) without being attacked by their "fans" and trolls and then getting accused of somehow just attacking them and then banned.\n\nSupport that hypocrisy. Pay a lot for it. But remember to be a nice little good yes men (or woman) when commenting and attacking anyone who criticizes anything about it, There may be a moderator position in it for you.\n\n\ncmonn Sea, Brother None, scramble to delete this and invent more false accusations.

If i was reviewing a game similar to that i would be totally happy and giving it a great thumbs up. The mistake the developer made was saying it would be similar to it in the first place.\n\nIf your buying this game forget the notion it will be anything like Planescape torment, nothing apart from the art style is anything like the old game. You will find no interesting characters, no interesting areas, no interesting quest in your first 6-7 hours of play in the first area, almost no combat to speak of, no humour. Its just NOT FUN.\n\nWell lets look at the positives charater creation is cool, until you relise you get the same stupid looking character model/ portrait no matter the choices, i mean the planescapes main character looked terrible but it was totally apart of the story why he looked like a corspe and thats what made him unique. Animations and graphics have evolved due to technology but it displays some of the worst character models ive ever seen, i can barely see the difference the species of creatures.\n\nOut of all these type of game so far its the worst ive played, once its finished ill review again but hell its not worth the money, looks like a million dollar cash grab to me.\n\n","February 1","false","8.1"," 16 of 52 people (31%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","31","16","52","3","2"

You were warned.\n\nTo those who think im being unreasonable or just hating on the game: please go back to your fallouts 4, wastelands 2 and other garbage hailed as universal masterpiece. If however you played things like Consortium, Age of Decadence, Silent Storm Sentinels, Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines or had an irl roleplaying adventure with a competent DM, and enjoyed them, - you are likely to agree with me here. The game is at best a 7/10, despite all the promises and hollow boasts at how incredible its gonna be, it doesnt deliver. It hasnt delivered the experienced it strived and promised to. If you disagree with that, hey im happy you are happy with the game, because i am not.\n\nI have concearns about this game. I absolutely love the concept, how its realised however... i played just one hour got annoyed with some things to be honest. A lot of people are giving this a 10/10 straight up, talking about how great it is, and for the most part its pretty solid, however: there is room for doubt. During my 1st launch i died before spawning, *spoilers* you are ejected from a sort of cocoon down the planet, so i figured might aswell get there faster. Dead. But if you sit around in midair pondering existance you dont die despite falling god knows the distance. Now ingame the reason for why you die in one condition and dont in another : Terminal velocity, nevermind the distance its the speed that kills you. Great.\n\nMoving on: the tutorial is a cluster♥♥♥♥ and in theory as you see memories of others it could be incredible, what it fails to do however is give any sort of direction or motivation. Oh hey its another faceless husk i never seen before and i get to decide what happens... oh boy, where you pretty much select what stat you want to increase, which is probably far from what you would have done if you gave 2 ♥♥♥♥♥ about the characters involved.\n\nWriting is top notch with a few bumps here and there but its all too ♥♥♥♥ing convenient. Oh hey check it out! There are 5 tanks and consoles, oh gee and 5 enemies 1 per console who could have guessed. Oh and the radiant light vanquishes yeh yeh great tides n stuff.\n\nI sat there for an hour (or less i might have went to cook something) being bored out of my mind and i love rpgs. I had no empathy to anyone involved for all i care the characters should have all died. It wasnt some intense situation there is no sense of urgency or impact or pretty much anything other then tedium forced upon you. QUICK THERE IS NO TIME TO EXPLAIN GET THIS DONE! OH YOU WANT TO KNOW MORE? WELL LET ME TALK TO YOU ABOUT IT FOR 20 MINUTES WE GOT TIME! You just proceed at your own convenience, where is the monsters starting attack midsentese because you are ♥♥♥♥ing too slow? Where is need to survive? Why should i care for a hundred characters im gonna see for just 20 seconds of screen time?\n\nIts 2d and yet it lags like no other. There is no optimisation whatsowhever. And on top of all that, they hired Mitsoda to help them sink this boat.\n\nThe game has a great potential, it can be amazing, hell i ONLY saw tutorial, nothing more but it was enough for me to be dissuaded from exploring any more at least till they release this.\n\nIts a no for me atm, only people i can recommend this to are avid RPG fans, game has some interesting things to offer, but not too many and are outweighted by all the negatives.","January 30","false","1.0"," 24 of 83 people (29%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","29","24","83","5","5"

I paid full price and can't get past 2.5 hours. This is that bad. Character generation is needlessly long. I sit through a question/answer sequence that ultimately means nothing in gameplay. Unlike the old Ultima, there's no distinction for answering different ways. Just different numbers in meaningless stats.  The story? This isn't one of those 'gamers hate to read' comments. It's simply not an interesting story and THAT's why I don't like reading it.
