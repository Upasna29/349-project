This is merely an assessment of the game as it stands now.\nCourier of the Crypts is a stellar throwback to golden age of SNES era gaming and is currently available in Steam early access. At present, the game offers roughly two hours’ worth of content and this could be stretched out a little if you plan on finding every secret. It looks great, sounds great and shows incredible promise – but at a fairly steep buy in price of £8.99, is it worth your time, and indeed cash in its current state? Let’s take a look.\n\nCourier of the Crypts follows the journey of a nameless young courier as a routine delivery to the sacred crypts goes from bad to worse. Trapped in a living nightmare, surrounded by evil spirits with only a simple torch and his wits to keep them at bay, you must traverse the depths of the crypt and solve fiendish puzzles to discover the truth and return to the surface. Very little narrative is actually conveyed direct to the player, instead relying on hidden notes to flesh out the story and provide hints on where to find hidden treasures. There are occasional bouts of dialogue though these are few and far between – particularly as the story is still being implemented. While so far what little of the story I know of might not be groundbreaking, it’s enough to keep me interested and incentivises finding more hidden notes. One criticism however is the lack of interaction with the environment. With a solitary setting such as this, and very little dialogue, being able to inspect your surroundings and hear what the courier has to say about it would make exploration more engaging and enjoyable.\n\nAs far as gameplay is concerned, Courier of the Crypts would be best described as an exploration-puzzle game in a loosely similar vein to the Legend of Zelda (minus the combat). The game plays out in stages selected from a linear map like Super Mario World, this is slightly disappointing as I expected a sprawling interconnected over world with possible backtracking, but maybe I jumped the gun a little on that assumption. In any event, the level based design doesn’t detract from the game in any way, and I fully expect branching paths to make an appearance further into development.\n\nThe goal of each level is merely to reach the exit and proceed further into the crypts, and every step of the way you will be hounded by vicious spiders* , death-traps and puzzles. However, at all times you will require your torch to drive off enemies and find your way through the gloom. Darkness is a persistent threat and managing your light source is paramount, as when it runs out, it’s pretty much game over. The name of the game in COTC is conservation. Carefully managing your remaining ammo, torch levels and health is the key to success. By paying close attention to the environment, you can manipulate enemies into various traps, thus saving on precious ammo potentially needed to break down a wall leading to a secret area. Sadly, slain enemies don’t drop anything making fighting them all the less rewarding. For the most part they can be avoided altogether if you keep an eye on their path, of course this requires the torch to be kept on, and if you plan on exploring fully, you’ll run out of fuel before too long. There’s a careful balancing act involved in each level, but with all the secrets to find, and the fair challenge on offer, the game does a solid job of making each level fun and diverse.\n\nEach level contains three hidden relics, as well as other gold and treasures – thus far there doesn’t seem to be a shop or merchant of any kind, nor do the acquired relics unlock anything. I don’t doubt that they will have interesting uses upon release, but at present, this is merely indicative of how little is actually there. Indeed, at the moment there isn’t even an inventory screen, and any acquired items are simply shown in the top right of the screen unable to be inspected. I would hope to see a proper inventory screen including item descriptions, as well as a running tally of discovered secrets and relics as the game proceeds through development.\n\nCourier of the Crypt does a terrific job of establishing atmosphere, which is no easy feat in a retro styled game. It manages this through effective use of lighting and ambiance – both of which combine to create a genuinely eerie feel to some areas of the game. The retro pixel graphics are very nicely implemented and manage to remain, distinct and clear amidst the dark level design - the shading and lighting effects really make the crypts graphics shine through. The sound design is also incredibly competent featuring a number of fantastic compositions by Zdravko Djordjevic which were a joy to listen to. For the most part, levels have no music, instead featuring a cold ominous ambiance which highlights the sound effects of the courier’s footsteps and the creaking of old wooden doors. Again, the great sense of atmosphere really helps to realise the dark game world.\n\nOverall, I greatly enjoyed the time I spent playing Courier of the Crypts, and was very disappointed that it ended as quickly as it did. With only six stages (as well as a fabled secret stage), there’s not a lot on offer, but while it may be in a semi-unrefined state, what little there is, remains incredibly promising, especially for the work on a single man. COTC has its share of problems such as some cheap deaths, infrequent checkpoints and poor English throughout much of the text, but those thirsting for a solid retro style adventure game need look no further. Upon release, COTC will be more than worth its asking price, and by buying in to early access, you have a chance to try it out early and provide feedback to help guide its future development. For all these reasons and more, Courier of the Crypts should stay firmly on your radar and is definitely worth a purchase in its current state.\n\nPros:\n-Beautiful graphics and lighting effects\n-Plenty of hidden secrets\n-Great, eerie atmosphere\n-Diverse enjoyable gameplay\n\nCons:\n-Puzzles are pretty easy\n-Combat isn’t rewarding\n-Lack of interaction with the environment\n\nTentative Score: 8.5\n*For the squeamish among you, there is an “arachnophobia filter” available in the settings menu which swaps the spiders for beetles…it’s not much better.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","September 7, 2015","true","2.8"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","13","14","2","0"

A poor helpless child is thrust into an impossible situation and its to up you to guide him to safety and find out whats going on. The only protection you have is the light and your wits. Your only ally a torch which is slowly fading, and keeping the monsters at bay. You do not want to know what happens when it runs out. Time is of the  essence.  Courier is needless to say, a very difficult game. Courier doesn't do much hand holding and throws you neck deep into its puzzles, which you must carefully navigate as you face nightmares trying to kill you. While you can kill some of the creatures that chase you, your resources to do so are finite, you must use them wisely and at precise moments otherwise find yourself lacking in a key pivotal moment. Overall Courier accomplishes in its themes and aesthetic. The dungeon feels dark, evil, and mysterious. Cobwebs hang and treasure shines as you make your way slowly forward looking for traps. All the while watching your pitiful light fade ever slowly away. With bosses, shops, and more features to be added to this already fun and challenging adventure game. I personally cannot wait to see what is it that awaits for our Courier and the nightmares that will be unleashed.\n\nI made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!\nhttps://youtu.be/Y0MHQhEEKoo\nI hope you enjoy!\nMartyr","July 12, 2015","true","1.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

The game achieves this by using dynamic lighting and very nice sound design. These two elements work perfectly together so one enhances the other, and it just draws you in to go and explore.\n\nThere is of course the Torch, which plays a major role in almost every aspect of the game. It's used for solving puzzles, dealing with enemies and if nothing else, to help you navigate through the darkness of the crypts. Don't let it run out though ;)\n\nOverall it's a solid game for an Early Access, the important foundations are all there - gameplay, visuals, sound design, along with menus, gamepad support and other, smaller things. The bugs are rare and the developer is very keen on fixing any that pops up. The one wish I have is there were more maps and levels. I'd like to keep exploring and see what new puzzles and secrets I'll be faced with. The trailer shows some really nice ones and hopefully it won't be long until I can play those as well.\n","May 24, 2015","true","10.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","2"

Each of the “crypts” feels like its own living micro-world that you have to navigate through in order to survive. The way each creature moves, attacks and flees is fascinating, and some puzzles can be a bit of a challenge if you aren't paying attention to the world around you. The main character, the Courier, is a young and lazy boy, who has stumbled upon an ancient torch that wards off evil forces. He must travel through the crypts in order to complete his courier job. Problem is every evil entity is after him and his magic torch capable of repelling the evil magic within these crypts.It is up to you to guide him through these mazes, outwit enemies, solve puzzles and complete his delivery.\n\nThere are multiple ways to travel within the crypts, and even someone who just likes destroying enemies will be satisfied with how this game plays. It is rewarding no matter how you play it, and there's no right or wrong way to get through each maze. While taking your time is encouraged to find everything but to discover the secondary story about the torches origins and the meaning of the small cutscenes requires more effort. The player will still understand the story, they just won't get the full lore and if that doesn't matter to them then it should be fine. The developer has ensured that players can play through this adventure using multiple methods, however the puzzles are subjected to one fixed solving pattern. But to get to the puzzle one could be stealthy, go in rocks blazing (Since rocks are your primary weapons), or you can always trigger the enemies to follow you and lead them into a clever trap. The sky's the limit for what you can do to finally reach your end goal.\n\nFull Review[www.noobfeed.com]","July 15, 2015","true","5.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

As you all can probably tell from the screenshots. I would highly recommend this to anyone who likes narrative game experiences combined with unique gameplay. The game is pretty much bug free, which is rare for an Early Access game. Some minor annoyances here and there, which will probably get fixed later (see cons).\n\nThis is not a hack 'n slash dungeon crawler so if you are expecting to massacre hordes of enemies and gather insurmountable amount of loot, this is probably not the kind of game you're looking for. You have projectile weapons and bombs (probably even more variety in later stages) but they are very limited and you're just best off trying to avoid enemies rather than waste bullets.\n\nThe main mechanic of the game is your magic torch, that keeps the enemies from charging towards you. They will still hurt you if you get too close to them but at least they won't run towards you from the other side of the room to eat you. You have a limited amount of power in the torch so there's a pressure to conserve the fire in order to make it through the level. Trust me, you don't want the torch to run out of juice..\n\nPros:\n+ Graphics are gorgeous. Especially the lighting effects.\n+ Great atmosphere.\n+ Gameplay forces you to plan ahead, conserve your resources and to thread carefully.\n+ Bosses are fun and challenging.\n+ Sound effects and ambience works really well.\n+ Interesting story and setting. Makes you want to find out what happened. Dialogues/monologues are also nice touch.\n\nCons (aka. minor nitpickings):\n- The checkpoints only activate once. I went through a level where I finally beat the boss but still wasn't done with the level. I died after that and had to start from a checkpoint before the boss, even though I returned to the checkpoint after the boss fight. Would've liked a save after the fight too.\n- Not too much variation in the gameplay for what I've played so far.\n- Dialogues would benefit from professional editor's touch to make them less clunky. They are not bad by any means though.\n\nAll in all, I'm loving the game so far. It's very good for an Early Access game and the developer seems to be working hard on the game. It's definitely worth a buy even at it's current stage.","July 7, 2015","true","1.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

And those machines that collect the corpses and make salami of them. (ok, maybe not the last two)\n\nIn short, buy the game and play it.

I will revisit this feedback once I've had more time with the title, but suffice it to say that I am already thoroughly impressed with this "one man show".\n\nThe game features gorgeous pixelart, eerie atmospheric environments and a lovely soundtrack. I have only spent an hour or so in the crypts, but I am eager to dive back in an uncover all the relics and secrets hidden within! :)","May 25, 2015","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Developer is obviously working hard to produce regular quality content updates.\n\nI really love how the map is covered with darkness so you really have to explore with your torch to find all the secrets and treasures.\n\nAlthough the maps may look similar at the first glance they are far from that. Each one has a different ambient and they all have different puzzles, traps and challenges. The game feels really challenging at first but slowly it lets you figure it out how to live down the crypts and it gets "easier" over time.\n\nPIXEL ART IS AMAZING! Everything is so beautiful and detailed. I get scared off by a rat because I don't like them but they look and sound like the real ones!\n\nIt is  clear that a lot of effort was put in this game and it is hard to belive that almost everything was made by one developer, just woah! Also, the the music and sound effects are really, I mean REALLY well done and are a big part of the game and it's atmosphere.\n\nI can't wait for new content updates!","December 31, 2015","true","10.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Woop for early access success :D","March 31","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
