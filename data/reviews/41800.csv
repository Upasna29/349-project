"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kschang77/recommended/41800/","kschang77","kschang77","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kschang77/","993 products in account","GSB is basically a sandbox game where you design ships and set them to battle other fleets and watch the outcome. The idea is to create a force that can win the battle wtih minimum amount of force (resources) and with minimum amount of casualties, usually by exploting a particular enemy's formation, weapons, shields, fleet composition, and so on. You have 3 classes of ships: fighters, frigates, and cruisers. Each needs to be fitted with engine, powerplant, shield(s), armor, weapons, crew, and other equipment (scanners, jammers, and more). Different weapons have different stats. Some are good against shields, others against armor. Some cycle faster but are weaker, while others may load slowly but punch hard. Cruisers may be vulnerable to swarm of fighters getting inside its shields, while frigates are usually pounded into pieces by cruiesrs, but are usually death to frighters (if armed with the right weapons). You also control the fleet's placement on the map and can give specific orders, like "primarily engage fighters".\n\nThere are dozens of preset scenarios (battles), 10 different races (each with unique combination of ship designs and special weapons), as well as ability to challenge other players (can you do better than my battle?) and fleet vs. fleet machups.\n\nOnce you set your formation and fleet, just hit "start the battle" and watch your ships fight it out based on the orders you've given, to the best of their ability.\n\nAs you win battles, you gain prestige points which are used to unlock more advanced equipments and ship hull designs.\n\nAll in all, GSB is an interesting toy that feels at times like a huge puzzle, But it is so addictive, much like setting two ant farms together and have them fight. Give it a try, despite its two-D presentation. You may end up liking it a lot and can't stop playing.","July 16, 2013","true","23.6"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","0"

However, it is not a complete game in itself.  The campaign is quite small and it does not go far enough with its technological 'skill tree' progression.\n\nThe gameplay is purely strategic and very hands-off.  You build a fleet of ships, with the resources available, and you send them on their way.  You have minimal control over how battles pan out, and there is no gameplay beyond the battles.  Additionally, the interface is somewhat slow and unnecessary time consuming to navigate.\n\nThe most disappointing aspect of GSB is its blatant premium content model.  After you have purchased the game, you will be required to purchase a number of nominally priced DLC packs to get the full game content.  By buying this game, you are essentially only buying part of a game.\n\nI give Gratuitous Space Battles 3/10 flaming spaceship hulls.\n","November 28, 2013","false","3.0"," 47 of 77 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","47","77","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DT_76/recommended/41800/","DT_76","DT76","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DT_76/","62 products in account","Played this one quite a bit.  I really like the concept, but the execution is just slightly lacking.  The ability to customize is fantastic, as is the ability to order around your fleets.  The problems are:   Differentiation between races and outfits is too slight.  Huge swings in stats/price could lead to things getting unbalanced (and the one race that's the most different is unbalanced), but the gear on offer is just too similar to other entries in its category (of which there aren't that many).  If you get a shield that's advertised as 'fast-recharge', but has a recharge rate just a tiny bit higher than the standard one, it's kind of disappointing.  Likewise if you switch to a new faction to discover that aside from ship classes and small passive ability, their only advantage is a single racial outfit that's (again) almost identical to the standard one.\nA game that's essentially a management sim has to have decisions to make, tradeoffs between cost, power, weight, etc.  This game has those in spades, except for the problem above.  But, it also has to have careful balance, so no one linear strategy (always get the cheap/expensive stuff, just spam A, etc.) dominates.  I would assert that the game fails this second test.  Due to eccentricities in how damage is calculated, it's possible to build a 'tank' ship that's almost invulnerable to attack.  Combine that with the prevalence of (arguably) the game's best weapon, a multi-warhead missile launcher with the best range and striking power available (and because of the multiple warheads, it handily defeats the point defense system options - and did I mention missiles have infinite ammo?), and you have a recipe for an intense stalemate.  If you avoid such degenerate tactics, the game can be fun, but I would rather see exploitative things nerfed out of existence.\nPlaying the campaign mode is the most enjoyable for me, once everything's unlocked.  But the mac version is buggy, and I've been unable to get it to work properly.  It'll play the standard campaign fine, but won't load up either of the other 2 maps.  The whole point of any TBS style 4X game (which this expansion turns it into) is the variety in the randomized map and different factions, etc., but this game comes with exactly one galaxy map to try and conquer (later patched to 3, but that's still too few, and as noted, they don't work right).  There is a user-created program that will make randomized maps, but only for the win version apparently.\nOh, and lastly, combat is entirely non-interactive (you're basically watching a movie of how well your forces do), and it maxes out at 8x speed.  Fine, except that your fleets start far enough apart and often move at such glacial speeds that it takes a minute or more of staring at wallpaper peeling until they make contact.  So, I wanted to like this more than I did.  It's still good, but falls short of greatness.","July 7, 2014","true","64.4"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","15","19","0","0"

At a glance, these games seem to share many similarities.\n\nBut GSB simulates a higher command level than SFB. In SFB, you're a captain of a single starship, participating in fleet skirmishes as part of a larger team. You coordinate your efforts, but each captain enjoys his own successes, and brings glory and honor to his team through personal victories or by dying honorably. In GSB, you're tasked with assembling a fleet and deploying it for scenario combat, and then... sitting around and watching the battle.\n\nTo me, this is not particularly rewarding, or entertaining. It's hard not to just crank up the speed to the fastest setting and learn the outcome of each battle.\n\nI quickly lost interest after the tutorial, and went straight to the manual to confirm that you get no control of ships.

The battles themselves can be fun to watch, but thats exactly it... you're just sitting there, watching and waiting for the fight to end. This can be pretty painful in matches where fights are long and drawn out. Overall, I am enjoying the game, but I honestly don't think I could reccomend it.

Debris and flaming wreckage litter the battlefield as fighter pilots go on strafing runs against seemingly invincible capital ships.  This game is full of Gratuitous Space Battles.  That is also its title.\n\nThis isn’t an RTS or twitchy strategy game.  No, its much more clever than that.  You actually don’t have any control over your ships once the battle begins.  Rather, you play the role of fleet admiral, designing and tweaking ship loadouts and giving formation orders before battle begins.  There’s no overarching story to follow, simply a progression of battles across beautiful space backgrounds against increasingly deadly foes.\n\nThe base game ships with four playable races, each of which has their own ship designs and specialties.  These races fill all the stereotypical sci-fi roles, from bug-eyed collective to evil empire, plucky resistance to hypercapitalist federation.  There are dozens of ship modules to mix and match, trying to find the perfect combination to bring unstoppable death to your foes.  The kicker is, you have to unlock almost everything by winning battles with less than the allotted pilots.  You buy new modules, hull designs, and races with Honor, which is earned by overcoming better than even odds.  Send too many ships into a fight?  You won’t get much out of that battle.   Simply adding a new ship design or switching races gives you a totally new outlook on the same encounter.  You can run an individual battle as much as you like, tweaking and prodding your strategy into a perfected masterpiece of war.\n\nThe graphics are passable, though the UI gets a little grating after a while.  Sometimes its difficult to read some of the text, even on a large monitor.  The music, likewise, is generic but fun, sweeping orchestral pieces that add drama to these largely meaningless fights.  A cool touch is the notification bar during battles, where your individual ships will let you know how their shields are doing, which decks have hull damage, and whose reactors are leaking.  This little bit of flavor is quite refreshing.\n\nThe main conceit of this game is the lack of overarching strategy and story, which is refreshing at first.  There is still a sense of progression as you unlock all the options for your fleet, but eventually you’ll have all these options and nothing else to do but replay the same missions over again on a higher difficulty.  There are six DLC races that have their own personalities and additional missions, if you want more variety from the four the game ships with.  There is also a Galactic Conquest DLC mode, which gives you a map to conquer and, interestingly, pits you against other players’ fleets that they’ve uploaded.  Positech calls it “massively singleplayer”.  You’ll call it getting utterly destroyed by people who have already mastered these systems.\n\nGratuitous Space Battles is a fun game, and there’s definitely a lot of depth here if you want to get deep into it.  I almost think I might enjoy it more if the ships were prebuilt and I just had to deploy them, rather than have to juggle placement and fleet makeup AND individual ship restrictions.  It all becomes a little overwhelming.  But its all worth it to see laser beams blow up an alien cruiser.","April 8","true","4.5"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Every victory you win will give you a credit like reward called Honour. You use this 'Honour' to buy new shiny gadgets or weapons that blaze nice looking beams of death onto your enemy.\n\nThere is no actual story line. The game is basically composed of about 14 setups (counting the tutorial battle aswell as an additional 9 setups when including all the DLC's, which brings the number up to 23) which all offer a different challenge along with a certain species to go against. This means that just because your ship designs and the fleet you deployed were successful against a certain race in such a scenario, doesn't mean that you will be as successful in another scenario with a different species. Not to mention certain scenarios having something called 'Spartial Anomalies' which can affect how well/poor your ships perform in terms of their weapons and defences.\n\nThere is also a multiplayer mode which tbh isnt what you actually think, it isnt a match-up with another player, see who wins and say "HAHA YOU SUCK!" kind of game. No, how it works, is that you mainly pick your map and make your own scenario, deploy your ships that you designed and upload them. The scenario is then uploaded to a vast list of scenarios for the community to try out. Some may even consider retaliating your challenge. However i would just recommend trying out created scenarios to try out since there is a vast list of uploads that there is only a small chance of someone actually trying it out your own.\n\nWith every game however, it has its drawbacks...\n\nNot counting the DLC, you may find it fustrating when you find yourself losing and on the recieving end of super intense beams of destruction blowing your stuff to smithereens, again and again. After the battle you are shown stats which are near impossible to understand, so you may end up in a repeating scenario of losing, losing, losing, then after more losing looking at the stats in attempt to study what is wrong, make new ship designs, still lose, go back to the drawing board, still lose and then wondering why the hell you cannot win when you study the stats for almost an hour. Also without the DLC you may end up finding yourself bored with just 4 races at your disposal, one of which you cannot fight on the single player mission scenarios.\n\nAs a result you may find yourself thinking that you wasted your money on a game you cannot understand and find out how little content you had. I would advice buying this game when there is some sort of sale or deal going on with this game. Buy with the DLC expansions too to give the game a little more spice to your experience with the game. That and a lot of patience with the losing and looking up for tips on certain situations and you may end up actually coming back to this every now and then.\n\nDespite these flaws, GSB is quite a fun little game to kill an hour or so...just don't expect to fall in love with all the info you are bombarded with at the end of the battle. Again i would advise getting the DLC's as they include an extra 6 races to try and mess around with and a Galactic Campaign, though i would avoid not getting to engrossed in that too much due to the Galactic Campaign having some flaws, but the rest should keep you occupied with this game for even longer.\n\nIt may have moments where you say ♥♥♥♥ THIS GAME, ♥♥♥♥ ITS MECHANICS, I WANT MY MONEY BACK!, but stick to it and hopefully in the end you will be glad you bought this game along with the DLC's.\n\nEven though the game may end up annoying you with stats and at times fleets that make you think this is all impossible to understand, it can be really fun to play once you get used to it, maybe you could one day decide to play out of rage and take out your anger on a bunch of aliens who have no reason to be blown up whatsoever, except for your entertainment of zero-g fireworks and act as some sort of stress relief!\n\n7/10","January 3, 2015","true","141.3"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

This is a tactical and strategic game where you don't get direct control of your ships.  Instead, you use the parts you have unlocked to design ships that you expect will perform well against the enemies you think you will encounter.  You assign them orders to follow, like what to attack, and when to run.  It is a really fun game once you get used to the concepts.  Designing the individual ships is more than half the fun for me.

Unlike most strategy games, you don't directly control your troops (or in this case, capital ships and fighter squadrons). In fact, you have no say at all once the battle's begun, but that's not a bad thing.\n\nThe idea is that you're the "fleet commander" and you give your orders to whatever ships are going into battle.  The ships' captains and fighter squadron leaders are then left to make their own decisions during combat. Sometimes things don't go as intended, but that's war.\n\nYou get to purchase new items for your ships with "honor points" (based on how few ships you needed to win a battle) and these upgrades can make a major difference.  Best of all, the game is designed with modding in mind.  You can find tons of mods already available -- many of which are based on Star Wars, Star Trek and so on -- and it's not too difficult to make your own.\n\nIn closing, I'd definitely recommend buying this game.

While most tower defense games let you build stuff as the battle progresses, this is the opposite where you have to set up everything beforehand and hope for the best. To be honest, it's kind of refreshing just being able to sit and relax and watch the battle play out. There's a mode where actually can take control of a ship, but doing so disallows some rewards.\n\nI certainly appreciate what they were trying to do here. I am a fan of seeing massive fleets of ships blowing stuff up in space, like a good ol' Macross Missile Massacre.\n\nWhile I like the brassy orchestral soundtrack idea, I feel they could use better, and more compositions. I quickly found myself switching to my music player instead.\n\nSome things could be balanced better. I haven't thoroughly explored strategies yet, but from what I played, Fighters are basically worthless. Frigates might be cool, but they have a nasty habit of dying in shockwaves, causing chain explosions in a clumped fleet. Thus, Cruisers seem to be the best bet. I'd like to see more ship classes, like the dreaded Doom Star, or even Star Fortresses and planetary defenses (Master of Orion II talk here).\n\nQuite frankly, if they somehow were to combine this game with Master of Orion II... that would be the most amazing ******* thing ever! (Granted, Master of Orion III did *something* like this, but that game as a whole needed work, badly). With some funding and shiny 3D graphics, I think they'd have something really special here.\n\nIf you're on the fence, give the demo a try.

Without the Campaign aspect, the game is very limited and ultimatey you won't have much to do.\n\nBut with the campaign, while it is VERY limited to just building fleets and maintaining them (with no other 4X concerns; all structures are pre-built in any given system), it becomes a completely different game.  Since the fleets are uploaded from players, you'll always hit new interesting configurations for specific systems; add in all the special per-system rules that you need specialized ships and the concern of maintaining supply lines for your fleets, and it becomes a pretty engrossing game that requires far more planning and leaves you with the threat that the next attacking fleet might have your number with a counter.\n\nIt's not perfect; I wish there were NPC factions and such in the 4X part with persistant forces for more strategic-level planning, but none the less, I've sunk hours into Campaign long after I previously gave up on the game.  Still this is definitely got a game for people who enjoy designing ships as a central priority.  If you do, it's on my easy list.\n\nAnd a word on the dev pricing - that I agree on.  The fact only one of the expansions is on a reasonable DLC sale right now is lame.  $6-7 for a new faction is entirely too much and I think he'd earn more from halving the stock price and actually participating in Steam sales more.

It's definitely not RTS because you don't give any orders during combat.  The strategy of the game lies in deciding what components to fit your ships with (factoring things like cost, weight, armor, power consumption etc.), what ships your fleet will be made up of, how to spatially arrange your ships in the fleet and finally what orders to give them as they are sent to battle.  Then the player sits back and watches the lasser and missile fireworks show unfold.

The game promises a straightforward brawl without the complications or delay presented by having any kind of story to get in the way.\n\nFirst, you design your ships. There's a great deal of customization options available, but many are locked when you first begin the game. In order to unlock them, you'll need to play through the missions (more of "combat scenarios" as there is no story behind any of them). It's rather frustrating, almost feeling like the developer decided there needed to be some sense of progression in the game since there would be no story, but I found it to simply get in the way.\n\nOnce you've designed your ships, you select your scenario and plan out your ship deployment. Many times you will see the enemy deployment, but on harder difficulties the enemy deployment will be a mystery. After finalizing your deployment, you press play. And here lies the second central conceit of GSB - the battle plays out in front of you without any control. After starting the scenario, your ships fight the enemy on their own, based on the starting deployment and fairly detailed movement and targeting parameters you can give each ship in the planning phase.\n\nI've found the AI to be - at times - frustratingly stupid, which can cripple your careful deployment. There is an option to retain manual control over your ships, allowing the game to play much more like a traditional RTS, and often times I resorted to that so that I could quickly change targets as the situation warranted. This feels like a concession, though, to unhappy players, as the game is clearly designed to be played in a manner where you set up all the pieces and then see what happens when you press start.\n\nStill, with the ship design and deployment phase leading to you sitting back and watching your work unfold, it's very satisfying when everything works together just the way you envisioned it. GSB does a respectable job capturing what it would be like to be a fleet admiral who set the battle plan but had no direct control over the course of the fight (with the one caveat that the fleet admiral would be able to give orders throughout the fight as necessary).\n\nThe main problem I had, though, is that it just didn't hold my interest. While the lack of any story to get in the way of the action may be appealing to some, I found that there was no real reason to keep playing. Stories allow you to become invested in the game world, to identify with a character or a faction. Sometimes the story is just the experience of having explored the map and built your bases - you've invested time and effort into the game world. Here, there is nothing even like that.\n\nSure, there are some vague hints about the game universe in the faction descriptions, but the scenarios become a matter of simple trial and error. If one ship design doesn't work, just go back to the drawing board and pump out another design. There's no penalty if you fail, and there's no way that you can lead your navy to victory once the tide begins to turn against them...you just have to watch them die.\n\nTo be fair, an expansion has been released that adds in a Galactic Conquest mode, where you actually have a persistent campaign. But I'm not going to buy an expansion for a game unless I'm interested in seeing more, and GSB wasn't compelling enough for me to want more.\n\nAlso listed on my website[www.thesewall.com].","August 24, 2015","false","10.6"," 20 of 37 people (54%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","54","20","37","5","0"

The real fun is had in the DLC & the complete pack is worth it over the stock game, particularly the 'Galactic Conquest' mode which really makes this game a great way to burn more time than you intended...\n\nThe premise is simple: chose a race, although you only have 1 of the 4 'stock' races avaialable at the start, design fighters, frigates & cruisers by taking a hull & equip it with weapons, shields, amour, engines, crew & other extras. Sounds simple. And in a word, yes it is. Except that the ultimate ship armed with more weapons than whole armies will never have enough crew or power or shields. The balance is superb. Each race even has slightly different attributes; some develop more power or have stronger hulls.\n\nYou gradually unlock better equipment & so are constantly redesigning your Ship Of Ultimate Death, but the real fun is Galactic Conquest & is worth every penny. The game generates a new galaxy each new game & you have to conquer it. The game uses fleet designs submitted by players & only a few planets can build new ships.

You deploy a fleet and watch what happens. You give each ship or squadron generic orders ("attack frigates" or "defend cruisers") and let 'er rip. That's not the fun part.\n\nThe fun part is outfitting your ships. Each ship has so much space, so many small weapon slots, etc. You have to fit each ship in your fleet with a reactor, engines, shield generators, armor, weapons... The whole deal. You can just use the pre-generated ones, but good luck advancing in the game.\n\nIf all that appeals to you, try this game. I can certainly see why this wouldn't be for everyone. Some people don't want to have to design their fleet; they just want to play with it. Some people want to micro-manage their units. This game is for neither of those people.\n\n[UPDATE]\nJust started playing this again because I got the "Galactic Conquest" DLC. So now there's an actual campaign. I find that my favorite part of the game is designing my ships. actually buying/building them and deploying them is just what I do to test my designs.\n\nThe addition of a campaign mode is great. It's a very simple matter of conquering planet after planet, not building buildings or starbases, but just building your ships and sending them against computer-controlled, user-designed fleets.\n\nThe DLC also added a "direct control" option on the fleet deployment screen. So while you're deploying your fleet, you can decide that at some point during the battle you might want to issue direct commands to your ships. I've never used it, but I guess if you don't like the AI controlling your fleet, you might appreciate it.","June 13, 2011","true","25.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You deploy a fleet and watch what happens. You give each ship or squadron generic orders ("attack frigates" or "defend cruisers") and let 'er rip. That's not the fun part.\n\nThe fun part is outfitting your ships. Each ship has so much space, so many small weapon slots, etc. You have to fit each ship in your fleet with a reactor, engines, shield generators, armor, weapons... The whole deal. You can just use the pre-generated ones, but good luck advancing in the game.\n\nIf all that appeals to you, try this game. I can certainly see why this wouldn't be for everyone. Some people don't want to have to design their fleet; they just want to play with it. Some people want to micro-manage their units. This game is for neither of those people.\n\n[UPDATE]\nJust started playing this again because I got the "Galactic Conquest" DLC. So now there's an actual campaign. I find that my favorite part of the game is designing my ships. actually buying/building them and deploying them is just what I do to test my designs.\n\nThe addition of a campaign mode is great. It's a very simple matter of conquering planet after planet, not building buildings or starbases, but just building your ships and sending them against computer-controlled, user-designed fleets.\n\nThe DLC also added a "direct control" option on the fleet deployment screen. So while you're deploying your fleet, you can decide that at some point during the battle you might want to issue direct commands to your ships. I've never used it, but I guess if you don't like the AI controlling your fleet, you might appreciate it.","June 13, 2011","true","25.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It comes with a few (10-ish) single player campaign missions and 3 races each with it's own set of ship hulls.\n\nThe learning curve is there but it's not steep, you can get away with skipping the tutorial. What you do in this game is you customize your ships, and on a budget with restricted amounts of pilots you deploy them into pre-determined battlezones, you customize the AI a little and then watch the battle ensue. You cannot manually control or micromanage ships while the battle is on-going, you must decide it all before the battle.\n\nIt's a unique but cool take on real time strategy. In space. You can expect to get anywhere between 3-10 hours from it depending on how fast you catch on to techniques for easy victories, and how much time you spend customizing your ships. For me, as soon as I'd unlocked all the modules and finished all the campaign missions, it was over. There wasn't even any lore to get into. I didn't have any interest in online play either.\n\nOverall it was a decent and fun game, but I found it lacking in content (both mission quantity and amount of things to do for honor points. Once you've unlocked everything, there's no reward for winning battles any longer), not quite worth a 15$, but if you catch it on sale, it's worth at least one playthrough :)","November 18, 2014","true","5.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

Instead of manually controlling all of your units and furiously managing your economy, you design your units (space ships in this case) and define certain characteristics of how they should perform in battle (distance to maintain from enemies, formations, some AI behaviors) and then let the battles play out.  You can't control anything during the actual battles.  This game is all about planning and strategizing, and there's a lot to offer.\n\nWhat I believe is the key difference that makes this game great is its emphasis on overall strategy rather than micromanaging an absurd level of detail.  Yes, a bit of micromanaging would make the battles easier, but it's your plans and strategies that will win the day rather than your ability to build structures really fast.

But what it all leads up to, the battles themselves, I actually found rather tedious. All you do is sit, watch and make assessments on how well your plan is playing out in real time. It doesn't help that the graphics are nothing special, looking like they belong in a game released a decade ago. What I heard of the soundtrack was high energy and enjoyable.\n\nWhat will make or break whether you dig GSB or not is how much you like managing your fleet outside of battle. There is a lot to sink your teeth into here including creating custom ship loadouts, assigning orders that prioritizes their AI actions in battle, numerous races, and unlocking new parts for your ships using "honor" points you get from completing missions. There is a neat system that increases honor received relative to how FEW ships you can use in battle and still win. For example, if you use a fleet costing 20K in a battle that allows a maximum of 25K you will get more honor than if you went all the way up to that 25K cap. This adds replayability, optional challenge and deeper strategy to each mission.\n\nGratuitous Space Battles wasn't my cup of tea but it fills a small gaming niche that will surely delight some people.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/colonsimulator/recommended/41800/","colonsimulator","Hippo Turtle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/colonsimulator/","1772 products in account","In Gratuitous Space Battles, the player is allowed to design ships with various elements, arrange them on a grid prior to battle, and provide each ship with preset orders. That's it. You are not allowed to participate in anything else. There are many unlockables and such, but this does very little to make the bare bones game enjoyable. There is no storyline, nor a campaign of any description. The game provides the player with so-called scenarios, and all that means is that the developers arranged the enemy ships in a grid. Once again, that's it. There is not much else besides that. You may also unlock a few other races, and each race has about a dozen "scenarios" (if I can even continue to refer to them as such). Each component that could be equipped for each of your ships has different descriptions , but they do not impact the overall performance of the ships in any significant way, nor do they alter the player's overall game play experience. Each and every time you go into battle, is almost a near perfect repetition of the last attempt, with very little variation, if any at all. Each of the races do not provide the player with true alternatives in order for them to actually be considered unique or different from each other. There is absolutely no action, nor climax in any of the battle instances you may go through as you play the game. It is like watching a limited and basic screen saver, over and over again, with very subtle differences each time. Even if you unlock all the hulls/components and implement them in ship design, there is barely any noticeable performance difference in the battles. It is as if nothing changes. In addition, the game does not inform nor hint at the effectiveness of any of the components you will have available to equip your ships. The AI is also comparable to that of a screen saver, in every describable way. There also appears to be no sound effects whatsoever, besides the ever repeating music. A representative from the developer named "cliffski" can be found in the Gratuitous Space Battles Steam forums being arrogant, pompous, and rude towards others who have a negative opinion about the game. At the time of this writing, the developers are asking for $20 for the game, and an additional $37 for six DLCs. There is basically very little content here, for an irregular and exorbitant amount of money. I have never come across such an exaggerated difference between content and pricing prior to this shameful release. This is completely unacceptable and despicable, and developers such as these should not be supported in any way, shape, or form. It is with releases such as Gratuitous Space Battles that we see proof of very low quality and very low content getting worse and worse. This game is comparable to adjusting the settings of a screen saver, then watching it run. There is very little actual game play to be found in Gratuitous Space Battles. If you like screen savers, you may want to give this displeasing, limited, uncreative, and meager attempt at a game a try. While the idea is interesting, the overall execution is nearly anti-game. The premise furnishes a false sense of choice over your ship designs, when in reality, there is little strategy as this is more of an actual screensaver. Despite many alterations to your designs, the results will be very similar. I hope you have a CRT monitor so that this glorified and expensive screen saver could actually become useful.\n\nGratuitous Space Battles is mediocre.","August 13, 2013","false","9.7"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

You are unable to participate other than simply watching the battle play out.\n\nEven worse, once you've got strategies that work for you, the best thing to do is save them to reuse later.  While that cuts down on the tedium of rebuilding the same thing over and over, it effectively removes one of the few things you still had control over.\n\nCombine that with the lack of any story to keep your interest, and this game grows boring in a hurry.

There isn't a sandbox mode to quickly test fleets against each other, the after-battle graphs are impenetrably thick and there's no explanation I found for what "most effective" means, especially considering different weapons will have different uses (e.g. anti-fighter versus anti-shield versus anti-hull).\n\nIt's frankly a bit more of a mess than it needs to be.","October 13, 2014","false","10.7"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

There isn't any bugs or issues that I was able to see, and doesn't require a bunch of amazing resources to run.\n\nBut, it just isn't all that much _fun_.  The premise is that you build and design your fleet and then have a go at another computer controlled fleet battle.  While the idea sounds epic, the execution left a bit to be desired.  Since the battle itself plays out by the computer, and not via any type of user control, all the thought has to be put into the design of the ship.\n\nWhile that itself, seems reasonable, you quickly find out in the AI battles, that your AI of your ship is a brain-dead hacked ♥♥♥♥♥.  It will incessantly pound with small fire on another ships shields, doing no damage, while taking out small ships with the big guns, resulting in your ship getting routed because the big-guns should have been used elsewhere.  That and any idea of using tactics of any sort is thrown right out the window since you have zero control over the outcome other than via _design_.\n\nSo, while the game is expertly written, and is good for a few hours of laughs, there just isn't enough there to keep you interested very long.\n\nBuy it on a Steam sale day for laughs, otherwise save your money for a real game.","June 27, 2014","false","1.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

All this banality is interspersed with serial idiot Jar-Jar Binks perpetrating his unique brand of aggressive stupidity with criminally negligent fervour. Cut to the gratuitous space battles already.\n\nWith the focus on space battles, GSB has dispensed with fatuous back stories. You basically get a bunch of space ships and attack another bunch of space ships. Aside from tweaking the loadouts on the ships that's essentially it. It does get repetitive but the space combat is well implemented with a visually mesmerising myriad of missles, torpedoes, lasers and other weapons-of-death.

GSB is a blast to play, and I'm a big fan of any strategy or sim games--particularly those that reward careful planning and creativity.  This game is centered around building a fleet and laying out a battle plan; the battles play out according to decisions made prior to the battle.  A 'direct control' option is available to enable RTS-style control during battles, but this feels tacked on and the game shines when one avoids this option altogether.\n\nGSB gives me the impression of building model space-ships from a box of purchased parts and then letting those toy ships destroy each other.  Add in the mix of battling other peoples' fleets via downloadable challenges and a campaign system, and it's the ultimate nerdy space wars game.\n\nTry out the demo; if you enjoy it, buying the full game is a no-brainer.

The main game loop involves you designing ships, deciding which ones to deploy, then assigning orders. Then you just wait and see if it works. If it doesn't work, then you have to try to figure out what went wrong and how to win. I just find that loop to not be very engaging and be more mentally exhausting than stimulating. The amount of thinking about tradeoffs and all the decisions the game wants you to make are more stressful than fun - it's pretty much everything I don't want to do in my free time (it's the same sort of mental exhaustion I encounter at work).","November 7, 2014","false","1.2"," 8 of 18 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","8","18","0","0"

The idea of watching a bunch of spaceships you control blow up other spaceships is great. Except you don't control them at all. You set them up and watch the fight afterwards. There are fast forward buttons, but you have absolutely no control during the battle at all. Granted, there is an enormous amount of mechanical detail where you can arrange the formation, AI, weapons, and armor of the ships but the end result is still setting up all your toy soldiers to watch them fall down.\n\nDefinate pass.","December 6, 2013","false","9.8"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

The UI is clunky. Given the number of actions you're expected to take while setting up your fleet for a battle, there are hardly ANY keyboard shortcuts that are useful. It's just constant button clicking... GUI items that you'd expect to be able to simply double click to activate... well you can't. You have to click the item, then click a separate "ok button" across the screen, then probably click an "are you sure" button half-way back the other way across the screen. Which isn't a huge deal, but it gets excessive really fast because it's a common thing throughout the whole game.\n\nThere is also at least one glaring logical bug that freezes the game. In the ship designer, you can open a "load" dialog to load a saved ship. In this dialog, you can also delete any of your saved ships. If the ship you deleted is the one that was active before opening the dialog, it's basically frozen. Every time you try to do anything, the game generates a new error window, but you can't see it if the game is in full screen mode. You'll be greeted by 20 error windows when you alt-f4 out of the game.\n\nAlso, it's one of those games that handles alt-tabbing poorly. On my system, if I alt-tab, I'm welcomed by a black screen when I come back. It will never restore. I have to close the game and lose whatever I forgot to save.\n\nA lot of potential, but a lot of overlooked frustrations that should have been ironed out before releasing it. Not that it matters now because it's so old, but this is me releasing the frustration I've built up by playing this game.

Is it the fact that the battle doesn't need to happen, that the conflict could be resolved without a space battle? But then, isn't it true that all space battles are gratuitous? For who is so  craven to claim that humankind is not at its core reasonable, that there are no insoluble problems, that anything t hat can come down to blows can similarly come down to negotiations? What, in the end, does fighting resolve? What is the solution that can come from wrecked starships, exploded fighters, barrages of missiles, that cannot come from mediation, arbitration, and understanding? Are we really so far gone that violence can ever be the only answer?\n\nIf "gratuitous" means lots of lasers, though, that makes sense. This game has lasers by the buttload.

A game of little depth or complexity, but enough spread and slight innovation to keep one going. See below for in depth review.\n\nSo I downloded this game years ago from it's official site and was excited to see it on Steam. Unfortunatly I forgot how powerful nostalgia was. This is a great game for kids, a kind of "baby's first space war," but not for a seasoned gamer, or even a casual one above the age of fifteen.\n\nAs the description boasts, there is no backstory, there is no diplomacy, and there is no base-management. What it fails to mention is that it did not add anything in to make up for those deficiencies. The game consists merely of building ships, that is, placing weapons and support modules on pre-constructed hulls, and hurling them at each other. Once you put the ships on the battlefield and click play, cross your fingers and pray, because you can't manipulate your ships AT ALL once the battle starts. That seems like a pretty big issue to me. But then again, it's all just one gratuituous space battle. Each battle is identical, with just a little environmental variation and change of enemy to make it look other wise.\n\nShip building is alright. Don't try and specialize. There are modules to heal yourself, heal others, heal fighters, stop missiles, free enemies. Don't. Anything not packing the max amount of weapons and shields will be destroyed very quickly. It's not a well-balanced game. If you want a real space RTS, look up Battlefleet Gothic: Armada.","March 20","false","2.8"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Or is it a space admiral sim. Well its really addictive. The gameplay involves setting up a fleet to destroy an ememy fleet. Thats basically it. But the weapon,armor and enemy types are varied enough that you will be required to design your own ships and outfit them with specific components to deal with the current and future challenges. When the battles play out, you have no control over anything except the speed of battle. This allows for alot of trail and eror, which i kinda like.\nThere are a few gripes i have with this game. The progression system is annoying and requires that you play over and over to get honor so unlock modules, hulls, and races. The modules and hulls not so much a problem, but i do wish the other races were available by default. Also i wish there was a toggle to swap between full screen and windowed when the battles play out. These options do exist in the settings menu, but i did kinda prefer the pre battle stuff to be windowed and the post to be full screen, thats just me though.\nIf tactics and experimentation are something you want to get into, i suggest you try this one.\nNote - If you are visually impared, you may find that the text amounts and stats are abit intimidating. The good news is that this is one of those games that works in windowed mode along with Windows magnifier (At least on Windows 8). Just make sure that when you switch the full screen mode off, you reduce the resolution to the same aspect ratio you are used to, eg. if you play in 1920 by 1080, run it at 1600 by 900. There is also a ticker at the top of the screen during the battle that will explain whats going on, but this is really tricky to read even in windowed mode, however it didn't really stop me from playing through the campaign.","March 12, 2015","true","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is large void, which is largely unexciting, except for the occasional contact with a third-kind.\n\nUnsurprisingly, games based on space settings are hyper-efficient in capturing the unexciting parts of space, either forcing players to explore large areas, or to establish themselves on planetary systems for hours on end, before finally getting to the more exciting parts.\n\nGratuitous Space Battles (GSB) threw out these nonsense, with no empire building, no resource hunting and no aimless exploring. Instead, GSB throw players right into the fray of combat.

Nothing is more enjoyable than setting your fleet in motion and watching it annihilate the forces of your enemies.\n\nHowever, there are a few drawbacks.  The first drawback is that the game tries to encourage you to limit the size of your fleet by rewarding you with "honor" in exchange for sending out a cheaper fleet.  It doesn't care about how many survive their encounter with the enemy, only that yours is the only side left standing.  So there isn't  a point in trying to keep your fleet alive.  Another drawback is that the ship save system gets a bit complicated, leading to a huge swathe of ships made for specific scenarios and set ups.\n\nSo again:  Like designing your ships and sending them into combat, go for it.  Looking to fly them yourself or be rewarded for your brilliant tactics?  Move on.","December 3, 2011","true","122.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It allows you to create your own ships and set commands for them and ,instead of you having to manage all your ships, you just get to sit back and enjoy your fleet blasting your opponents into intergalatic space dust. The game is extremely addictive because it makes you strive to create the unstoppable fleet, and once you get there you always realize that you could do something else to make it even more amazing. Small tweaks can change entire battles. Adding or taking away ships or weapons can mean life or death. If you spent more money on shields you could last longer but you might have a cheaper engine. These things have to be accounted for when playing.\nPros: Addictive gameplay, endless amounts of customization,  online battles, wonderful graphics, and countless other features.\nCons: Price (its pretty expensive for what it is), online could be better, High learning curve.","November 19, 2010","true","35.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It allows you to create your own ships and set commands for them and ,instead of you having to manage all your ships, you just get to sit back and enjoy your fleet blasting your opponents into intergalatic space dust. The game is extremely addictive because it makes you strive to create the unstoppable fleet, and once you get there you always realize that you could do something else to make it even more amazing. Small tweaks can change entire battles. Adding or taking away ships or weapons can mean life or death. If you spent more money on shields you could last longer but you might have a cheaper engine. These things have to be accounted for when playing.\nPros: Addictive gameplay, endless amounts of customization,  online battles, wonderful graphics, and countless other features.\nCons: Price (its pretty expensive for what it is), online could be better, High learning curve.","November 19, 2010","true","35.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Nothing is more enjoyable than setting your fleet in motion and watching it annihilate the forces of your enemies.\n\nHowever, there are a few drawbacks.  The first drawback is that the game tries to encourage you to limit the size of your fleet by rewarding you with "honor" in exchange for sending out a cheaper fleet.  It doesn't care about how many survive their encounter with the enemy, only that yours is the only side left standing.  So there isn't  a point in trying to keep your fleet alive.  Another drawback is that the ship save system gets a bit complicated, leading to a huge swathe of ships made for specific scenarios and set ups.\n\nSo again:  Like designing your ships and sending them into combat, go for it.

You set orders and formations prior to a battle and hope your stratagy will get you thru.

It is large void, which is largely unexciting, except for the occasional contact with a third-kind.\n\nUnsurprisingly, games based on space settings are hyper-efficient in capturing the unexciting parts of space, either forcing players to explore large areas, or to establish themselves on planetary systems for hours on end, before finally getting to the more exciting parts.\n\nGratuitous Space Battles (GSB) threw out these nonsense, with no empire building, no resource hunting and no aimless exploring. Instead, GSB throw players right into the fray of combat.

The rest is just a playground where you try making your own ships and pitting them against the fleets of other players. Fun...but eventually grows dull.

Or is it a space admiral sim. Well its really addictive. The gameplay involves setting up a fleet to destroy an ememy fleet. Thats basically it. But the weapon,armor and enemy types are varied enough that you will be required to design your own ships and outfit them with specific components to deal with the current and future challenges. When the battles play out, you have no control over anything except the speed of battle. This allows for alot of trail and eror, which i kinda like.\nThere are a few gripes i have with this game. The progression system is annoying and requires that you play over and over to get honor so unlock modules, hulls, and races. The modules and hulls not so much a problem, but i do wish the other races were available by default. Also i wish there was a toggle to swap between full screen and windowed when the battles play out. These options do exist in the settings menu, but i did kinda prefer the pre battle stuff to be windowed and the post to be full screen, thats just me though.\nIf tactics and experimentation are something you want to get into, i suggest you try this one.\nNote - If you are visually impared, you may find that the text amounts and stats are abit intimidating. The good news is that this is one of those games that works in windowed mode along with Windows magnifier (At least on Windows 8). Just make sure that when you switch the full screen mode off, you reduce the resolution to the same aspect ratio you are used to, eg. if you play in 1920 by 1080, run it at 1600 by 900. There is also a ticker at the top of the screen during the battle that will explain whats going on, but this is really tricky to read even in windowed mode, however it didn't really stop me from playing through the campaign.","March 12, 2015","true","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Nothing is more enjoyable than setting your fleet in motion and watching it annihilate the forces of your enemies.\n\nHowever, there are a few drawbacks.  The first drawback is that the game tries to encourage you to limit the size of your fleet by rewarding you with "honor" in exchange for sending out a cheaper fleet.  It doesn't care about how many survive their encounter with the enemy, only that yours is the only side left standing.  So there isn't  a point in trying to keep your fleet alive.  Another drawback is that the ship save system gets a bit complicated, leading to a huge swathe of ships made for specific scenarios and set ups.\n\nSo again:  Like designing your ships and sending them into combat, go for it.

I still keep it installed because I still enjoy it.\n\nSpace fantasty mixed perfectly with strategy.\n\nAll the lasers, beams, missles, decoys, sub-systems, and all the giant, slow-moving, death-dealing ships you could possibly want to create thrown into a game where you can pit them against a challenging AI that will have you going back to the drawing board to rethink your strategies again and again.\n\nI've reformatted my computer twice since I got this game and it was among the first to be reinstalled each time.  That says something about the replay value, I think.\n\nHighly recommended.","July 31, 2013","true","36.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

With a fairly expansive module set and the possibilty of designing the ships from the base up, you can build the ship you want. The standard battle and downloadable community challenges keep testing you and let you jump in for anything from a five minute battle to hours of successive battles. With the DLC addition of the campaign with community designed fleets, it adds a little more depth and ensures no campaign will   ever be the same.","July 20, 2012","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, insead of an real-time stragety, this game is more aptly described as a "retroactive strategy game".  This means you as a fleet commander are responsible for placing your ships in formation and then doleing out predetermined orders and plans of attack for each respective ship. The drawback being you cannot give them orders once the match has begun hence, "retroactive strategy"\n\nThis is an interesting mechanic, though sometimes frustrating as the ships will not always fare well, and you are forced to watch from the sidelines as your carefully laid battle plan falls to pieces.\n\ngorgeous detail makes you forget the 2D format of the battlefield, and the comic book worthy sound-offs from the units add hilarity to every battle.\n\nA damn fine indie title all-in-all, but the command scheme could use a bit more of a forgiving approach.\n\n7/10\n\n\n","October 10, 2013","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
