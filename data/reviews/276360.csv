Really enjoyed that, so I thought I'd get this for nostalgia reasons. It was a mistake. I don't remember the original having such frustrating controls. For this you have to use your mouse for just about everything, including steering and it just doesn’t seem to work. For the show jumping you have to approach the jump square, meaning if you over steer by just a little your horse will refuse. Dressage is even more complicated. The horse care factor seems to be the same as any other game of this type, nothing ground-breaking about it. The Riding Out option seems a bit pointless. The training you can do is probably the best part as you don't constantly have to stop every time you mess up!\nIf the controls were different this could potentially be a fun game, as it is it is just disappointing. I suggest sourcing an older PC and just playing the original.\n","August 11, 2014","false","1.2"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","17","18","0","1"

The controls make it practically unplayable, it looks far uglier in-game than it does in the screengrabs on the store page, and horse and rider customization is extremely limited. The actual riding isn't enjoyable at all and the mechanics feel like a mediocre version of every other horse game like this ever made (e.g. Silver Buckle Stables).\nDon't waste your money. You'll likely struggle through each of the three disciplines hoping one will be decent, be disappointed, quit, and never play again.","June 27, 2014","false","2.8"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

This is the not the best horse game I've played. Yea, I guess it is okay, but it could use some polish here and there. First of all, the compitions are hard. I mean HARD. though this game is finished/abandoned, it needs a SERIOUS makeover.\n\nPros:\n-Physics are okay.\n-Ride out, the scenery is beautiful.\n-Graphics are cool for a child's game.\n-Compitions are struggling, just like reality, disqualifcactions, Falls, Refusals, Etc..\n-Ehhh OK models.\n\nCons:\n-Compitions. Just compitions.\n-Grooming, the horseshoes are outside the hoof floating, WTF?!\n-Grooming, no gauge while brushing etc...\n-Stanima Gauge, I've seen horses in compition who can run for hours.\n\nConclusion:\nI just cannot reccomend the game. If you are searching for a game for your horse crazy child, keep looking.","August 2, 2015","false","10.8"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Especially RS3 has brought me years of wonderful gameplay. I don't even know how often I have restarted all three slots and how often I have finished the game compltely just to start anew.\nThe control, of which many here complain only suggest the usage of you mouse for the very best experience. It is not necessarily needed! It works perfectl using the arrowkeys and the W and S key for stirring the horse and commanding its gaits.\nAlso the rather long process of training your horse is very realistic. yes it gets harder and longer the closer you get to taking part in the grand show at Aachen. But it is also directly taken from reallife horseriding. It is indeed possible for a beginner to train for a week and then enter and maybe even win a beginners competition, but to achieve great results at a 4*/pro level or even attempt riding such a course it often takes years if not decades to achieve such horsemanship. Therefore far more realitic than many other horse simulation games.\nAnd therefore also the free ride option is really an option if you get to stressed training your horses for the next competition Level. also it is a great help to memorize and just plan out the current crosscountry course (even though there are no jups in free ride mode). And that of course in the very calming athmosphere aof a magnificent sunset.\nAll in all this game is a game with hours of fun for everybody. Be they adults who ambitiously train their horses for the worldcup at Aachen or be they children just looking for some fun gameplay.\n\n\nIch möchte hier einmal allen wiedersprechen die dieses Spiel schlecht reden.\nIch kenne und habe alle drei RS Spiele gespielt. RS3 hat mir Jahre voller wunderbarer Spiele geschenkt, ich weiß nicht wie oft ich die drei Slots neu belget habe und das Spiel von hinten bis vorne durchgespielt wurde.\ndie Steuerung, die hier viele bemängeln, schließt nur idealerweise die Steuerung der Richtung durch die Maus ein, es funkitoniert ebensogut mit den Pfeiltasten und W und S zum Gangarten abrufen.\nAuch das immer langwierigere und kompliziertere Training, je höher man kommt, ist sehr realistisch. Jeder kann sich nach einer Woche Intensivkurs auf ein Pferd setzen und ein E Springen bzw eine E Dressur reiten. Aber um in einem Springen under einer Dressur der Klasse S zu bestehen muss man oft mehrer Jahre bzw Jahrzehnte an seinem Können arbeiten.\nDa kommt einemder ruhige selbstbestimmte Ausritt im Abendlicht doch gerade recht. Auch um nocheinmal den Cross Parcours abzureiten, wenn auch ohne Hindernisse, bietet sich ein abendlicher Ausritt an.\nIch kann dieses Spiel nur jedem, sei er erwachsen oder ein junger Mensch, sei er JUnge oder Mädchen, wärmstens ans Herz legen!","November 6, 2014","true","10.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Charlie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/charlie-rainbow-unicorn/","41 products in account","The main reason I will recommend this game is because it's dirt cheap and it's quite fun to play for a bit, and even challenging on the dressage.\n\nThe game doesn't have any story line at all, just as a head's up. The game involves grooming horses, training for show jumping, cross country and dressage, hacking and competing.\n\nThis game was originally made for console (I had the game on PS2) and it doesn't seem they bothered to make any changes to put it on PC. As opposed to other equestrian games (most of which are not available on Steam) which use the arrow keys for direction, this game uses the mouse in a way that takes some getting used to. With a controller, one would use the right joystick/thumbstick to turn, pushing it to the right or left and releasing ; and so one must slide their mouse to the right or left to turn, but you must bring the mouse back to the center to stop turning. As we all have mouse accelaration, this can cause some frustration in the game play when you're not used to it.\nI suggest turning the mouse accelaration off to make it easier, at least in the beggining, or just plugging your controller in if you have one. I have played both ways, neither is particularly easier.","November 30, 2015","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You're supposed to press the right and left arrow keys to keep in 'harmony' with your horse, but this rarely ever works you must do this while keeping your mouse pointed in a certian direction and trying to steer your horse so it stays on course.\n\nAnd it the higher competion levels you have to do the Dressage 3 times in a row, I've never seen a Dressage event that has 3 'rounds'.\n\nPacked nearly 9 hours into this trying to figure out the controls, all I got in return was frustration.\n\nThe horse customzation sucks, you get to pick from three coats and a mane and tail colour. Can't even change the markings. You can edit the tack but half the tack is locked until you win the events.\n\nYou can free ride but the world is so ugly I can't stand using that feature.\n\nIf you're  looking for a good horse game on Steam, try My Riding Stables 2: Life with Horses and pretend this game does not exist.","October 9, 2015","false","9.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
