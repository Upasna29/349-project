"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dragnix/recommended/327220/","Dragnix","{FITH}™Dragnix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dragnix/","743 products in account","Summary:\n\nA point and click adventure game with heart, Anna's Quest does something that I haven't seen the genre do for a while: tug directly on the heartstrings in terms of empathy. While it's gameplay is what you'd want out of the genre and does a great job in really being in that sweet spot of not being too easy, but not being too painfully frustrating, it's the story telling and characters that carry it in a way that hasn't been done in the genre for a while. There's not a lot of humor and the visuals lack compared to some of their prior work in Deponia, but its clear that they wanted to make a heart-warming story more then anything else, and great voice acting and writing makes you want to see what happens next. It's a game that I'll be completing for the story alone, and that's what you need out of a game in this genre. Definitely worth a pick up for narrative focused fans or Point and Click lovers.\n\nGameplay Footage and Video First Impressions: http://youtu.be/CNSkY5ITB7s\n\nLists:\n\n+:\nPerfect balance of gameplay in terms of difficulty. Not too easy, but not with old PnC adventure game logic that makes you want to pull your hair out.\nThe story is superb and in particular, the empathy aspect of the game really shines through. Be prepared to have your heartstrings tugged on.\nVoice acting is great. In particular, Anna is played perfectly and the characters in question come to life thanks to their voice actors. Not over the top, but just right.\nEnough red herrings added in terms of gameplay without it being annoying for exploration.\nHave I mentioned the charm?\nPacing is handled rather well.\n-:\nThe visuals seem like a step back from Deponia.\nCould have added some puzzles/minigames to add a little of variety to gameplay.","July 3, 2015","true","3.6"," 40 of 50 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","40","50","0","4"

Separate sliders for Music, Voices, Effects, Cinematic Volume, and Global Volume, plus Fullscreen, Resolution from 640x480 to 1920x1080, Additional Animations, HD Cutscenes, and a slider for Brightness.  There are also six languages to choose from.\n\nI did the game entirely as point-and-click, but there are keyboard shortcuts if you prefer.  Left-click to interact, right-click to examine, press down on scroll button (or the space bar) to indicate hotspots. Double-click on an exit to immediately leave the scene.\n\nThe game offers a tutorial, which will guide you through the basics of gameplay, including how to combine items, interact with the environment, and use your powers.  Be aware that you MUST right-click (examine) some items in order for the game to progress, so remember to look closely at your environment and inventory items!\n\nThe game never tells you that there are 12 candy pieces scattered through the game.  Nothing happens when you click on them, save that they disappear.  Finding all 12, though, will net you an achievement.  You can find the Steam Achievement Guide HERE, and it includes all of the candy locations.\n\nGameplay is mostly logical, though there are a few odd tasks and solutions.  Overall, I'd say that it's one of the easier point-and-clicks out there.  Anna gives you the occasional gratuitous hint, and she won't let you do anything that would be game ending (like jumping off a cliff ;p )  Do REMEMBER TO SAVE, though!  There is an auto-save function, but it's not set up by default.\n\nI found the game to be delightful.  There are many references to fairy tales scattered throughout the game, not to mention hidden references to other Daedalic games.  The story is very dark if you stop to think about the full implications of what's going on around you, but the way it's presented takes away the horror edge completely... Well, *almost* completely. ;)  The beings we meet can be weird, amusing, colorful, wicked, mysterious, sweet, and more, making for a cast full of interesting characters.\n\nThere is a deeper message to Anna's Quest; one that is not immediately evident.  I will not ruin it for you by explaining further, but I will say that it had an unexpected impact on me.  Overall, I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed the game, and recommend it to those who enjoy the genre.","April 18","true","10.7"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","20","21","0","3"

It took me about 11 hours to complete the story and another 2 hour to complete the rest of the achievements.\n\nStoryYou are following Anna who lives with her Grandpa. But sadly he got sick and you must find a cure. On your journey you will have to solve riddles and puzzles to achieve your goal.\n\nThe story is very good and has some interesting twists. I wished there would be multiple endings. With only one ending I had not much interest in replaying it a second time.\nThere are many side references to other Daedalic-Games and fairytales from the Brothers Grimm.\n\nDesign and SoundI liked the art. Very well drawn and there are fun and interesting details you can spot in every scenes. Only weird thing is the missing eyeballs of Anna. It was kind of creepy at the beginning but I got used to it after minutes.\n\nSadly this game comes only with english audio but with several subtitles. Although I am not a native speaker I enjoy all my game in english. But if the developer is a german company I always switch to german audio because that is the language it has developed with. Nonetheless the english audio is very very good. The speaker made a great job. As a german speaker you may have some funny moments, when it comes to the pronounciation of some german words like "weisse frauen, hans, wunderhorn, etc."\n\nGameplay and ControlsMain inputdevice is the mouse. Well that's why it is called "Point&Click". Some elements can be controlled by your keyboard, like opening the inventory or showing interactive elements. But you don't have to use the keyboard at all. I played it completely with my mouse only.\nInteractions are devided into use, look, open inventory, dialogs and special power.\nFor replay aspects you can skip every dialog by clicking with your mouse to skip the current sentence or hit escape on your keyboard to skip the conversation topic.\n\nAchievementsThis game is very easy to 100%. There are several story based achievements you will unlock during your normal playthrough. After finishing this you can replay every chapter to get the funny "side objectives". If you explore everything you may get some of them in your first playthrough.\n\n\nOverall I give this title a solid 9/10. I would give it a 10 if it would come with german audio and multiple endings.","July 21, 2015","true","14.5"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","19","21","0","0"

I'm very grateful for both of them. You can also save at will, skip text if you read much faster than the characters voice act, and press ESC to skip entire conversations (extremely useful when going through the same conversation again, but not needing to read the entire thing).\nThe story and the characters. I like the themes and the world presented in this game. I like how the characters grow or are given depth. I rather not say too much about the plot, but I found it to be very enjoyable, somewhat somber, and a bit dark.\nThe different kinds of humor here. A lot of the humor was somewhat dark, especially with some of the situations Anna finds people in, but there are also plenty of silly happenings in there. A little girl with telekinesis is a good recipe for mischief.\nThe difficulty felt just right with about 95% of the puzzles. It was a fairly consistent experience for me which let me tackle the game at a good pace.\nThe art style that they chose to go along with the kind of story they have makes the experience a bit more interesting while keeping things from becoming too severe.\nConsThe voice acting seems fine. I definitely preferred some characters over others. I didn't mind the little girl voice that much for the protagonist. I did notice some uneven recording quality though which can be a little distracting, but I was mostly reading and clicking unless it was a voice I really liked. It's not all over the place, but I thought I'd point it out.\nThere was one interactive puzzle that didn't make that much sense to me in the first half of the game. I used the skip function instead of trying to solve it. I'm not sure that particular puzzle was designed well since it would have had me write something down which you don't have to do anywhere else in the game.\nThere was a section in chapter five that had some really illogical solutions to a puzzle chain. It didn't make very much sense and would require you to believe the characters involved had no brains in their skulls. That was the only string of puzzles that made me angry.\nNote: Some areas or items need to be "activated" via dialogue or discovery somewhere else which makes sense since you didn't know you needed it before. Otherwise you'd be carrying a bunch of garbage with you. Just pointing this one out. All your items will have a purpose.\n\nI like this game enough to give it a recommendation. It does many things well, but my favorite thing about it would be the story and the humor. I'd take this over Deponia every single day of the week.","January 27","true","8.2"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","16","17","0","4"

I'm probably one of the largest fans of Daedalic.\n\nPuzzle difficulty: 4/10 (10 being the most difficult)\nThe puzzles overall were not difficult. I only had difficulty with one of them, the rest were obvious. This isn't really a bad thing, unless the developers were trying to make them difficult.\n\nCharacter depth: 7/10\nI am not sure how I would feel about the characters if I weren't comparing it to the other Daedalic titles, but for me a lot of the meaning in this game comes from those comparisons. Otherwise, the main characters is extremely simplistic.\n\nBugs: 9/10\nI only encountered one noteable bug, which is an incredible improvement to some of the other games by Daedalic. I'm very pleased by this, considering Edna and Harvey had some literally game-blocking bugs.\n\nStory: 8/10\nLess deep than their other games, but still entertaining. The plot 'twists' were obvious, but of course that is the point. But, like the other Daedalic games, I'm left with questions! So I hope there will be a sequel, or a prequel.\n\nOverall, a very enjoyable game. I would have loved it to be longer, but that is always the case with a good story. I strongly recommend the game. In my opinion, this game means more when you have played the others that I mentioned, ESPECIALLY Edna and Harvey, due to the comparison between each of the three young girl characters.","July 12, 2015","true","21.8"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

Main character is too plain, too saint and too boring. Her innocent cute antics are ok first few minutes but after a while you just skip over her lines to avoid headache.  And you stack with her for the major part of the game. It really kills the joy as adventures are mostly about good mix of puzzles and story/dialogs.  It was much more fun to play a part of  antagonist's childhood instead of main hero quest line. The situation is worsened as Anna's side-kick  - bear-boy is as docile as she is.\n\n2. The story is rushed and abrupt, it feels unjust and ending is done in "lets just wrap it up quickly" way. I think it was one of the worst endings I've ever read.\n\n3. Puzzles are not polished enough and sometimes unable communicate properly what you are supposed to do. But mostly they are fine, though I don't like when you are not allowed to take items until some events happens. It really throws off your awareness about what you can use and what is just decoration items.\n\nOverall game is not bad, first part is quite meh, second part is interesting as story start to shape up but than sudden ending without much explanation kills everything good in it.\n\nOn positive side I must note that controls are good, no long runs, no long animations to wait for, solid stuff.","September 20, 2015","false","8.8"," 21 of 32 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","21","32","0","0"

The lengthy story manages to stay engaging thanks to the plethora of different areas you'll explore and the varied cast of characters you'll end up interacting with: the fact many of them come from well-known stories or legends is also interesting, and Daedalic adds enough originality to the mix to spice things up.\n\nI found puzzles a bit of a mixed bag though and, as detailed above, the fact you can only pick up/ interact with/ combine certain items only when "the time is right" can lead to some truly head-scratching moments where you wonder what you are supposed to do: logic puzzles with levers and such are also not my cup of tea but they at least make sense for the area they're in.\n\nDespite a few gripes with the puzzle design I can easily recommend Anna's Quest though: it's a very nice game and Anna's journey is one to see for yourself.","October 27, 2015","true","9.8"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

And even Anna comes to realize that trusting everyone you meet might be a mistake. Or does she?\n\nAnna's quest is another great game by Daedelic entertainment. The story's twist and turns, the loveable characters and the puzzle elements are perfectly mixed together. For what almost feels like a kids game at first it quickly moves into much darker themes, not graphically but story wise.\nJust like most Daedelic games the story gets more intense and exciting the closer to the ending you get. The graphics are cute and remind me of a childrens book, which kind of fits the main character.\nApart from the typical moments you get stuck and (find a walktrough) spend time walking aimlessly, the only negative things I have to say about this game, is that compared to Daedelic's Deponia series and Night of the Rabbit, Anna's Quest look rather downgraded  graphically in details of every scene and character. This is a minor issue but worth to mention as I remember how awesome the detail of the small things was in the other games.\n\n10/10 - Revenge can never be an excuse, but that is easy to say for those who don't know the cause.

We "grown-ups" just always mess them up! :)\nIt would have greatly complimented the character if she would have been voiced by a young person, not a grown-up woman acting like a child (for me there's nothing worse in voice acting than that, I cringed so many times, oh god) - with better writing of course.\n\n▽ The adventure drags, it's slow, It's always on the verge of being boring. It still has a nice touch and it's beautiful to look at, so you keep going, but...\n\n▽ There were 3 or 4 puzzles that absolutley made no sense at all. I only say "Cheese" and "Owl".

With out getting all spoiler alert on it, a few times you have to do things that previously, and from that point forward, the protagonist is flat out un-willing to do. Makes figuring out those particular puzzles that much more difficult and also detracts from the character herself. Her moral compass is established early and then for the sake of a couple puzzles it is negated only to come back in full force.","July 5, 2015","true","13.1"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

A delightful throwback that captures the spirit of more traditional point and click games, but with modern controls and graphics, and far less frustration.\n\nWhat's great about the game + Beautiful art style - cartoon-like, well animated graphics. A lot better than you usually get in a point and click (with some exceptions, of course). And as mentioned before - full of adorable things. Skip the kitten videos for a day and instead play with the baby dragon in this game.\n+ Decent story. Nothing particularly original, but a well told mash up of fairy tales with a telekenesis spin. The writing and art style gel together superbly.\n+ Voice acting is decent enough (not stellar but does the job!)\n+ Great length which makes it pretty good value for money (I left my game running when I wasn't playing it so ignore the run time, but I'm guessing at least 15 of those were active play)\n+ Good mix of exactly the kind of puzzles you'd expect for a point and click - nothing that'll have you tearing your hair out, either\n+ Very satisfying ending. Nothing surprising, but it wrapped up all the loose ends and felt fitting with the story.\n+ Slick controls/UI. No complaints there at all, and I'm usually pretty fussy about these things.\n\n\nWhat's not so great Very little I can think of to be honest. The main character does some pretty dumb things at times but that's completely congruous with her trusting character (and she is a child, after all).\n\nOverall This game is bursting with charm and joy and put a smile on my face so many times as I played it. I loved it so much I delayed finishing it because then I wouldn't have it to play any more. Incredibly endearing, and absolutely worth your time. I'm only sad there's nothing else in my backlog that I think would be as delightful to play as this. Pick it up, and enjoy.\nI suppose you could argue there isn't much in the way of replayability but that's pretty standard for these kinds of games.\n\n10/10 would quest again.","October 21, 2015","true","38.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

It's about a little girl with telekensis who sets out on an adventure to find a cure for her sick grandpa. Her level of innocence, empathy, and resourcefulness makes Anna a great character to play as.\n\nMuch to her detriment, though, she is very naive and trusts everyone too easily. And I guess that has been the best part of her character arc having reached Chapter VI so far. Learning who to trust and not to trust has become a fundamental aspect to the story, and it's great to see her keep pressing onward despite of the betrayals and disappointments she's confronted with.\n\nThe puzzles in this game are very logical, fun, and very rewarding to figure out. Point and click games are known to have some cryptic puzzles that you'd either need a guide for or several hours staring blankly at the screen, frustrated and scratching your head.\n\nYou won't have that problem with Anna's Quest, as the puzzles are easy enough to respect your lateral thinking, but not so hard that you sigh or groan is resignation from trying. There were only a couple of times where I needed a guide, but I know that if I spent a little more time to think or exhaust one more possibility, I would've figured them out on my own.\n\nMy gripe with this game along with anything by Daedalic, though, is the lip sync. Like, is it really that hard to program the lip sync to go with the vast amount of dialogue in this game? What I would also like to see from this company is some close up shots on the characters while they talk, kinda like in Broken Age, and maybe more physical gestures from the characters as they speak.\n\nThere's also the problem of dialogue strings starting off as if the first syllable or so gets cut off and it's a bit jarring when you're so invested in the dialogue exchange.\n\nLastly, what I do love about this game is the amount of maps there are in it to traverse through per chapter. The point and click games I've played so far have had the tendancy to recycle maybe the same 5 or so locations for most of the game, and that gets a bit boring.\n\nAlso: I am enjoying a certain part of the game where you get to play as the villain and see their childhood history. That really helps make them more than just an evil and dastardly villain, you see her as just another person with their own feelings and motivations, but who had ultimately made the wrong choices to land them where they are now.\n\nAll in all, Anna's Quest is a solid game. I got it full price and don't regret it, but if you ever see it on sale, do not hesitate to get it! If you get it for even 50% off, it will out live its value.","August 23, 2015","true","20.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The developers weren't exactly breaking new ground.\n\nRather than having magical talent, the main character has a Telekinesis ability that is used to help solve puzzles in the game almost as frequently as her inability to properly pronounce the word. The one thing that will immediately strike most is that the game is geared for a very young audience, and at best could be rated PG for the occasional harsh language. It is the sort of game a parent could be comfortable letting their kids play through.\n\nThe story itself is classic Germanic Grimm's fairy tales, and it is very well told, but again, no major suprises. If you're used to watching kids shows ala Dora the Explored etc. etc... you can see that the dialogue is pretty straight forward and is pretty bland.\n\nOne of my sticking points is that the voice-acting is pretty sub-par, and I found Anna's shrill, monotone, I'm-an-innocent-little-girl voice to be pretty grating. Sadly, there are a few instances where some of the other, younger female characters voice acting is so much better, I was left wishing that they had been chosen for the main protagonist instead.\n\nOverall, the game is really good, and the puzzles in the later part of the game really require a lot of thinking and are not blatantly obvious to solve, and if you'r a fan of this style of style of game, you'll not be disappointed.","September 1, 2015","true","35.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The gameplay has easy controls, a good feel to it, and a good backstory. I feel as though the flashback level should not have been the last level though only because this game's main character is Anna and not Winfriede. Also, after hearing what Ben said at the very end about Anna makes me think that they're might be a sequel. I feel that they should make a sequel to this game because of the ending AND because of the fact that we still don't know what happened to Anna's parents thanks to the prologue.

Humor  is similar to cartoon network shows if you into that . Artstyle reminds me Adventure Time which is my favorite show despite that I am 24 but this game is not as funny or relevant to my age .\n\nMy initial impression of this game was negative because it felt a bit generic the first 2 hours . I played many point-click games that start you inside locked room so it was very overused concept. However there were some creative puzzles,characters,solutions and places  that eventually won me over . Overall this is a solid puzzle game with fluid controls and interesting artstyle .\n\nPuzzles themselves were just hard enough to make you think but not burn your brain . I have encounterd only 2 that had wird solutions which is actually good compared to some other games I played . You can also hold a button to see the items that you can interact with . Text in game was well designed to give hints for solutions that are not self-explanatory ( short,fun and to the point)\n\nIt should take you around 10 hours to beat it at casual rate . For a point-click game it is a good length . I got it on sale and was very pleased with the ammount of content .\n\nVoice acting was very top quality which I assume is a common thing with this developer (very consistent and not over the top ) Just the fact that there are so many characters and each had uniqe personality makes it awesome .\n\nAlso I found myself laughing a lot because of inside jokes targeting people who play point-click games. Developer of this game clearly knows the audience . I think the first part of this game was a bit boring but for the most part I was amused .\n\nThis is a clearly well made game overall . I don't usually give scores but solid 9/10 for a point-click adventure .

Because initially, Anna’s Quest felt like a kid’s game. It has all the trappings of a fairy tale – an evil witch, a little girl in distress, a quest she must undertake. Even the puzzles were fairly simplistic, very rarely posing a challenge in the game’s first act, so I wasn’t expecting to be taken by surprise.\n\nBut Anna’s Quest has a little twist at the end of every chapter, each getting slowly bigger – one or two of which might be predictable – and an excellent ending that tugs at all of the right heartstrings.\n\nAnna's Quest is only brought down by the second-last chapter. And even that section has a twist or two. Overall, a sweet story, beautifully told, with a satisfying ending.

It feels like the game was rushed near the end game and completion of the game seems to lack any great detail in what happens in the ending. This underwhelming ending to an otherwise brilliant adventure game stops it getting a 9/10 review from me.\n\nSome people may not like how the game almost feels like its aimed at kids and that the main character, Anna, is a child with an innocent outlook on everything as expected of a young girl. This can make it feel a bit kiddy and girly but the puzzles have enough depth and satisfaction that a child would not be able to complete this game but adults would still like it.\n\nEnchanting but short - 8/10.","April 29","true","14.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Yes, I can surely say it is! Whenever I play a game of Daedalic Entertainment, I feel inclined to give a positive review, because you surely deserve it. Anna's Quest is another one of Daedalic Entertainment's masterpieces. Anna's Quest is a point-and-click game, filled with adventure and black humor. Anna is a small, cute, and innocent girl, a righteous girl with morals, that has the gift of telekinesis. She would never hurt anyone, even someone that wants to harm her. With her grandfather being sick, she decides to go out, into the dangerous dark world, to find a cure for her grandfather. Little does she know about what dangers she'll find in her way, but her pure heart and her telekinetic abilities will help her along her adventure. A person as pure and good as Anna, even though she may meet some enemies along the way, will surely meet some friends too. I can only give a 10/10 for this game. Thank you, Daedalic Entertainment, for another great game. I would surely love to meet the people behind Daedalic Entertainment at some point and congratulate them for all their games.","December 28, 2015","true","8.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Anna's Quest is a nice little Point&Click game about a girl with telekinesis.  The problem is the clunky interface and there is almost no intuition to solving any the puzzles. You end up random using items together and on the background hoping for something to happen. For example there is a rat holding a key, you can't do anything to it when you first see it, and later you can't interact it with it - so what do you do? You combine mold found hidden under the carpet with paint to make "cheese" then exchange that with the rat (the rat doesn't talk btw). Most of the puzzles are like this and it's annoying. It doesn't help that there are many background objects that can be interacted with but do nothing [except confuse and/or waste time]\n\nIt's a shame Anna's Quest is loaded with so much unfun because the art is nice and the story is not bad. There are much better child-friendly Point&Click games like Harvey's New Eyes (although there are comic deaths) & Night of the Rabbit, or Detective Grimoire. Anna's Quest is only recommended if there is a sale.","February 2","false","0.1"," 4 of 12 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","4","12","0","0"

The first one was the Curse of Monkey Island, followed by the Pink Panther games, which of course sets my standard pretty high and makes me appreciate Point N Click games with a cartoonish style and humour etc.\n\nWhich is why I'm recommending this game. It looks good, has a good story and good puzzles. I got stuck a few times (like the Swan puzzle) but overall I felt it was challenging enough without having absurd puzzles.\n\nThe overall feel of the game (and what makes it stick out) is that while the main characters are absurdly cute, the story becomes quite dark several times throughout the game. Like really, really dark. Which makes it feel fresh.\n\nThe only cons I can think of is if you are annoyed by the voice of the main character Anna, or annoyed at how good and naive she is since she won't hurt the bad guys.\n\nAt the start, I was annoyed by her voice and inability to solve puzzles by hurting people (which seemed like a good solution about a hundred times), but later grow to like her and find her absolutely charmingly cute. Which is balances itself out with the dark things that happens throughout the story.\n\nAnd that's the feeling of the game overall. It's cute, funny and dark. Buy it!

The narative is fun and interesting, plenty of colorful characters, and decent pacing and length.  The voice acting is enjoyable, even if Anna does speak a little slow given all of her dialogue.  The Puzzles are enjoyable, and nothing is too challenging (save for a certain cheese/mold puzzle).  There is even a "skip" button for the non-inventory related puzzles.  The art direction is colorful and animated.  A good solid game all around, the only really negative thing I can think of with this game is that there isn't anything too exceptional about it, everything hits a solid 7/10 but nothing really exceeds that.

The first one was the Curse of Monkey Island, followed by the Pink Panther games, which of course sets my standard pretty high and makes me appreciate Point N Click games with a cartoonish style and humour etc.\n\nWhich is why I'm recommending this game. It looks good, has a good story and good puzzles. I got stuck a few times (like the Swan puzzle) but overall I felt it was challenging enough without having absurd puzzles.\n\nThe overall feel of the game (and what makes it stick out) is that while the main characters are absurdly cute, the story becomes quite dark several times throughout the game. Like really, really dark. Which makes it feel fresh.\n\nThe only cons I can think of is if you are annoyed by the voice of the main character Anna, or annoyed at how good and naive she is since she won't hurt the bad guys.\n\nAt the start, I was annoyed by her voice and inability to solve puzzles by hurting people (which seemed like a good solution about a hundred times), but later grow to like her and find her absolutely charmingly cute. Which is balances itself out with the dark things that happens throughout the story.\n\nAnd that's the feeling of the game overall. It's cute, funny and dark. Buy it!

At only five points (I counted them with shame) did I reach for the walkthrough and those were only ever in times of dire need, where the game took the very occasional plunge into moon logic.\nAt all other times, the game follows a relatively strict and sensible path and - while it never directly tells you - subtly hints to you when you're on the right path with an idea, but there's something missing or the execution of the idea is incorrect somehow.\n\nBroadly speaking, if the answer that comes to mind seems sensible, it's the right answer, which helps the game out immensely.\n\nTopping it off is a very nice presentation, with a pleasant set of character designs, mostly decent voice acting and a story that is both funny at times and moving at others. as advertised, the ending to this game is actually great.\n\nThe game's only real flaws come in a couple of technical areas, the most extreme of which is that the game has a quite severe bug that comes into play when you try to run it at 4K. put simply, it won't. The game maxes out at 1920X1200 and while I wouldn't mind 1920X1080 stretched over a 4K screen, the game just runs in a window at the top left hand corner of my screen. There is a user-end fix that involves messing with the game's .ini files, but I couldn't get it to work.\nI should assume this bug also happens to anybody running a display with a greater resolution than 1920X1200.\n\nThe other issue is that the voices in the game occasionally fall short. The main returning cast are mostly fine, but some characters have a somewhat poor delivery to their lines. Though Anna and the other main cast members are good enough for the most part (and certainly good enough considering the budget this probably had) even they aren't immune to the occasional slip-up.\nAll of this isn't helped by rough cuts to the lines, which pop up a little too frequently, making some speech seem unnatural.\n\nFinally - though the game does a good job of pointing you in one direction or another, the game does not allow you to perform certain actions out of order, leading to the odd bit of frustration working out what you need to do to get to the point where you technically can perform an action but the game won't let you because you haven't done the pre-requisite actions.\n\nHowever, these are - as I said earlier - minor flaws perhaps inherent to a low-budget game and maybe even inherent to the format itself.\n\nWith those issues out of the way, I can safely say that I did indeed enjoy the game. Though I explained the drawbacks in greater detail I cannot say they really affected my experience too much. The game itself is rock-solid and if you're looking for a good p-'n'-c or want a good game that can run on a more limited machine then this is a great place to start. Even if you run bleeding edge hardware, this is still a very good game that's worth your attention.\n\nOh, and did I mention it's really cute? Because it's really cute.","February 11","true","16.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
