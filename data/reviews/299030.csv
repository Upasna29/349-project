But this is just a lazy DOSBOX emulation. Not to even mention the fact that Atari has the source code and they are just to lazy to release it and allow the community to make proper ports. The game's soundtrack is also bugged and will not even play certain tracks. Controls are annoying to set up. The game also runs sluggish on modern sytems. To put the icing on the cake, to access the expansion pack content (Cryptic Passage), you must create a shortcut for it in the file folder! I recommend this game like all hell, but not the Steam version. If only they could've took the Duke Nukem 3D or Shadow Warrior route, those are proper ports. The GoG version is digitally packed better (shortcuts), but suffers some of the same issues.\n\n5/5 - OG game.1/5 - Lazy DOS Emulation.\n\nNote: Check out this launcher that will allow you to play Cryptic Passage and more!

This is pretty much all I want in an FPS game. Blood is somewhat similar to a mixture of Doom with it's  abstract/nightmarish feel, Duke 3D with it's level of interactivity and the original Shadow Warrior with it's detailed layouts with many cleverly hidden secrets.\n\nThis is what I wish FPS games would return to, I simply don't get any kicks out of modern shooters of this era that claim to be 'oldschool' and 'back to the roots' - the design featured in Blood is what I consider to be a long lost and forgotten art amongst this industry. The difficulty provided by this game is also pretty intense, especially when playing on the second hardest - hardest difficuly. This includes 5 episodes, all of which are great, play completely differently and have a different mood from the last. The sound track is killer and adds a ton to the games atmosphere.\n\nOne of the greatest shooters out there - would definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys FPS the way it should be today.\n\nNote: I had to replace the outdated Dosbox files (0.73) with the latest version of Dosbox (0.74) to get this game running smoothly.\n\nBRILLIANT fix for performance, visual enhancements etc courtesy of my mate Agent Cooper ''find the configuration file named dosboxBlood in your Blood steam folder. Open it with notepad, search for the line that says output= and change it from whatever it is originally set to "output=opengl".'' Also allows the Steam Overlay to work ingame!\n\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx0L1zPw3LU","June 20, 2015","true","71.8"," 73 of 80 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","73","80","0","13"

Well worth the price. It's a good classic for fans of DOOM, Duke Nukem, Heretic: Shadow of the Serpent Riders, etc.\n\nEdit:\n\nI know that my first review was a bit short on words, so here's a more in-depth review that will be brief, but definitely gives you more of an idea of what I thought on the game especially considering the people that probably weren't satisfied with my first review.\n\nSo this game is definitely a game that is a satire on horror games and it's an early one at that. I don't like a lot of games from the 1990's, but this one will always hold a special place in my heart. When I do get in the mood to play games of this style (DOOM, Heretic: Shadow of the Serpent Riders, etc.) I  go to this game primarily because I thoroughly enjoy it's content and it's a game that you can spend hours on if you get into this type of game.\n\nNow I know that the pixelated graphics definitely aren't for most modern gamers, but they are for me. I enjoy the pixelated graphics and pixelated graphics have been overcome by this 3D world, but this is nostalgic and still timeless, in my opinon. If it weren't for the pixelated graphics it might even be a worse game as well.\n\nI would recommend buying this game because it is reasonably priced on Steam. I even have a physical copy of this game regardless of the fact that I bought it on here. It's really not that pricy on here and it would be worth a buy. I know it's not that popular and the community has probably died out, but it's worth your consideration.\n\nI'm a huge fan of retro games like this too, so this may be a biased review.\n\nAt any rate, I would first recommend going and watching videos on this game to those of you who are more modern gamers who are used to ultra or high level graphics. That will definitely be a huge switch for you, but the controls are most certainly simplified and you will have to employ tactics that are more careful than before if you end up getting into higher difficulties of this game.\n\nCheck this game out and have some fun with BLOOD.","July 14, 2014","true","7.2"," 77 of 93 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","77","93","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/moogychan/recommended/299030/","moogychan","Mugi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/moogychan/","355 products in account","Blood is a cult (literally) classic old-school FPS created by Monolith Software around the Doom / Duke3D era. It features fantastic graphics from the era, multiple (and sometimes comedic) references to music, poetry, books, movies, and even other videogames, a plethora of fun and unique weapons each with two different attacks (except the pitchfork), a strong line up of memorable levels like the Carnival and the Hedgemaze spanning 5 chapters, engaging and exciting enemies, and great midi music with modern (2004) remakes of each.\n\nFor old-school FPS gamers who remember playing this back in 1998, this is a warm welcome.\n\nUnfortunately, Blood has to run through DOSBox. Don't let this dissuade you, it works fantastically, but there are a number of .cfg tweaks to get it to run completely properly.\n\nMy two biggest and only gripes I have involve the music.\n1. From the untweaked version, the default music is the (in my opinion) inferior 2004 remakes of the original midi music.\n----1a. This is easily fixed by deleting the blood0#.ogg files in the main folder. This fix reverts the music back to the original midis.\n\n2. The music's volume cannot be lowered or turned off through BLOOD.CFG or the ingame options menu. Now if you enjoy the music, this shouldn't be a problem, but if you want your game to be a bit more quiet, you'd have to adjust the volume in Windows Volume control and raise the Sound Effects volume in game.\n\nBlood has been one of my favorite old-school FPSes for a very long time and I'm glad to see it and it's sequel finally land on Steam. While a couple of tweaks and fixes are neccessary, they should not sway your purchase negatively. Blood still runs flawlessly and contains hours and hours of fun. Now we just wait for Redneck Rampage to be added to Steam.\n\n10/10","July 17, 2014","true","2.2"," 60 of 68 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","60","68","0","0"

I love this game to death but this steam version is not what it seems it would be. DON'T BUY THIS VERSION, it's just the original DOS version and it runs on DOSBOX 0.73. I wish i could recommend this game but i just can't do to this problem, the resolution is bad on new systems, the controls feel akward (especially when the control scheme is over 15 years old and isn't needed anymore), the mouse movement feels clunky and slow, and there are many other problems with this game. There may be people who argue with me that this version is good because it "sticks to it's roots" but honestly marketing the game as a redone version and it just being the original version is unacceptable. Also, you can't release a game in this state from the 90s and just not re-do it like Duke 3D, Doom, or Shadow Warrior (which were all redone and run fantasticly on new systems). You can also just got emulate this game for FREE; and it's the same exact game. It's too bad, this had to happen to one of my favorites. Honestly, i will try to play this game to my best ability, because it's so great, and if you don't want to listen to what i'm saying and buy it, then just be aware what you're buying into.\n\nI appreciate you reading and i hope this review will help you to think twice before you purchase this game on steam.","September 7, 2014","false","0.9"," 83 of 105 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","83","105","0","8"

Every single weapon is insanely fun and satisfying to use, in a way that is rarely seen today.\n\nThis game is simply a must play for any at least semi-serious FPS fan. Blood's best qualities were untouched by time, and it is sure to satisfy anyone who likes a fun and challenging FPS. Blood is also a perfect example of that sheer creativity and quality of game design that is sadly all but gone from modern FPS games.","June 26, 2015","true","75.5"," 49 of 53 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","49","53","0","3"

Sadly, I did not play this until later on in my life, but still, this game rocks! I would have loved this game when I was a kid. This game mixes horror films and FPS greatness into one blended mixture of awesomeness. Please, do not judge this game on graphics, this is one hell of a fun game to play.\n\nThe weapons are very creative! Instead of the traditional pistol you get with countless other shooters, it is replaced with a flare gun which you can satifyingly burn enemies with. Watching your foes run around screaming as their flesh melts off, priceless. That is only one of the kick ♥♥♥ weapons this game offers in it's large arsenal. This game also has alternative fire modes for each gun too making awesome weapons that much more brutal and satisfying.\n\nThe MIDI soundtrack has some of the greatest tracks I have heard in a game. There is a non-MIDI CD soundtrack, I believe it is enabled by default, but I prefer the MIDI tracks. I find the CD soundtrack too slow and eventful to listen to while you are gunning down zombies and cultists. You can disable the CD tracks by removing the MP3 files (or WAV files, I can't remember) from the game's root directory.\n\nThe level design is awesome. My favorite level is the haunted hotel level in Episode 2. It takes inspiration from The Shining as you can find Jack Nicholson's frozen body in a hedge maze. Also, you can find the infamous tub where that disgusting old hag was in. Not sure if that was a pro or con, but it is in the game. Not only does this level have references, but there are other references to other horror films found in other levels like Nightmare on Elm's Street, Friday the 13th, and the list goes on.\n\nDon't pass this game up, play it!

The use of alternate fire modes which was pretty much unheard of in it's day, a few weapon types that are comletely unique to the game, set to a protaganist who's dark humour makes you smile while feeling oddly disturbed at the same time.\n\nThe game is hard - as I said, we're talking old school here.  The game doesn't hand hold you one bit.  But if you can figure the weapons out along with their alternate fires, the gameplay is very satisfying.\n\nAnd finally, the 8 bit music.  Hard to believe, but this stuff is actually pretty good.  They hit that sweet spot where it sets the mood nicely and at times is deeply disturbing.

You loved it for good reason back in 1998.  The religious horror setting really helped it to stand out among Duke Nukem and Shadow Warrior, two other games developed in the same engine.  It was obvious that with the porting of Duke Nukem and Shadow Warrior that retro FPS fans would be excited for a port of Blood.\n\nHowever, this is not a good port, it is just a lazy dosbox emulation.\n\nThe game doesn't even let you play all of it's episodes that it comes with until you edit configuration files.  You also have to edit and mod just to get mouse look to work, to get the game to not suffer performance issues, to restore the music to its original format and prevent t from bugging out and looping, to get the Steam overlay to work, among other things.\n\nThe worst part is that nobody can get the rights from Monolith to do anything with this property ever since they were bought out and gutted from the inside by Warner Bros, so we will probably never get an enhanced port that offers the basic modern features we have adjusted to, or at least one that doesn't have problems out the gate.\n\nI have spent several hours just trying to get this game set up the way I want and it won't work out for me, I'm done trying.  You shouldn't have to put in hours of work just to get a game to run the way you want it.\n\nIt's like I took five dollars and burned it because I wanted to experience Blood again.\n\nDon't do what I or anyone else did, you might as well pirate the game and dump it into an emulator/engine that will actually let do what you want with ease.  The pain and effort to get to play this game might technically be worth it, but there is simply not enough that you can do to make this playable.\n\nAnd honestly, does anybody look back at the days of using your mouse to move and the arrow keys to turn fondly?","July 30, 2014","false","0.3"," 55 of 78 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","55","78","0","5"

Those more experienced in games of this era will probably get more kick on higher difficulties as the game is pretty lenient on the "Lighty Broiled" difficulty level.\n\nNow, while the game itself is great shootybang funtimes, it has an awful habit of running terribly unless you change your settings just right, which will require some fiddling with the config files for DOSBox contained within the game folder.\n\nWhile the game itself shows five episodes, there is actually a sixth episode called Cryptic Passage that requires more config editing to run properly, which you should find instructions to on the Discussions page. It's got 10 new levels to bring the total in the game to 53 levels and, though not made by the same people, still have the same feel of the original episodes.\n\nOverall, I definitely recommend getting this game.","November 14, 2015","true","40.5"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","0"

It hasn't changed. I still love it. Caleb the is an awesome player character with with frequent one liners. Better than Duke Nukem. The gameplay itself is pretty damn too. So yes I reccommend this game.\n\n(optional let's play video)\nhttp://youtu.be/lcuTm2s5U-k\nHow to make the controls better:\n\nA few things you will probably want to do to make the game more playable is to set up the controls like a modern FPS game i.e. WASD keys for movement instead of directional keys and enabling mouse control.\n\nYou can change keyboard binding inside the actual game menu. So your going to want to change strafe left and right to 'A' and 'D'; 'E' or 'F' or whater to use action and so on. Change space to jump probably, Ctrl or C or whatever to crouch. If you repeatedly bind an action to a key I think it will clear unwanted controls (if you are using the in game menu). For example repeatedly binding space to jump will clear the 'A' key from jump so that you aren't jumping everytime time you strafe left. There doesn't seem to be a proper way to just unbind keys in the in game menu.\n\nYou can also change keybindings in the setup program which is also the only way that I could see to change the mouse button binding which you will probably want to change. So to get in the  setup program for Blood. Find the One Unit Whole Blood folder in the steam/steamapps/common folder or wherever. Then drag setup.exe into the dosbox.exe icon. This will launch  the setup program which probably won't work if you try run without the dosbox emulator. In the setup program I rebound the right click to secondary (special attack or whatever it's called) instead of move forward, turned the the sensitivity and inverted mouse control. Just keep pressing escape when you are done to exit the setup and make sure you save by pressing 'y' when you are prompted. Launching the game from setup.exe might not work. Just restart the from steam after closing the setup and saving your changes.\n\nOkay so the game a few flaws which I will just warn you about. Actually I can only think one now other than the default controls, maybe I'll add more later. Sometime projectiles from your weapons will clip in objects when they should clearly go straight to your target. Basically I was firing at a Zombie point blank over a cash register but I hitting the cash register. You just have work around this sort of stuff.\n\nGo play it, it's only 5 bucks!!!!!!! (Oh yeah just when I first bought this game I think it may have been like $80 and we didn't even have a PC that could run it lol)\n\nClick here for more let’s play videos =)","July 14, 2014","true","0.8"," 25 of 34 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","25","34","0","5"

Even in this day and age, the gameplay still feels fluid and satisfying, and each of the weapons are fun to use, with alternate fire modes available for each (quite innovative for its time).  The enemies are varied, and each meet their demise in a number of violently amusing ways (try using the voodoo doll on the fat guys for some "side-splitting" amusement).\n\nAnyway, while the game would benefit from a facelift, much in the vein of the Duke Nukem Megaton Edition, you could do much worse for $5.00.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/magmus/recommended/299030/","magmus","Magmus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/magmus/","319 products in account","GAME BACKGROUND:\nBlood is a game that is part of the Build engine "Holy Trinity", which also includes Duke Nukem 3D and Shadow Warrior.\n\nWhilst Duke Nukem 3D was the original and is easily considered the King out of the other games, both Blood and Shadow Warrior bring unique features and design compared to Duke Nukem 3D. Duke Nukem was a parody out of 80's action heroes, Shadow Warrior a parody of Kung Fu movies and the ultra-violent Asian movie craze whilst Blood was a parody of Horror movies, especially with the atmosphere, easter eggs and spoken lines by the protagonist which is often a famous Horror movie quote.\n\nBlood was a popular and somewhat successful game at its time, but both Blood and Shadow Warrior were overshadowed by not only Duke Nukem 3D, but the rise of Quake which saw most people rather buy and play Quake instead.\n\nSTORY:\nNow onto the game itself, you play as a man named Caleb who comes back alive in his grave at the start of the game. Caleb was once part of the evil cult named Cabal. The leader of the cult, Tchernobog, betrays Caleb and kills him, putting him in a grave, this was done as Tchernobog feared Caleb's power in case he ever turned on the cult.\n\nWhen the actual game starts itself you rise from your grave ready to strike vengeance against the cult and Tchernobog, as well as save the rest of The Chosen (who Caleb were a part of). There are 4 episodes in the game and the first 3 episodes are about saving 3 of The Chosen who were also betrayed by Tchernobog, whilst the 4th is about destroying Tchernobog himself.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nThe gameplay is pretty much identical to Duke Nukem 3d, but the differences are the enemies and the weapons as well as the items that Caleb uses. You start the game using a pitchfork to kill the first zombie but then quickly move on to the flaregun. I have played Duke Nukem 3D, Shadow Warrior as well as Blood, but out of the 3, Blood is by far the most difficult. This is because there is less emphasis on weapons that deal direct damage, such as Duke's pistol, shotgun and chaingun etc, whilst in Blood even though you are equipped with a shotgun and tommy gun yourself, a lot of time you are using the flaregun which kills enemies over time and doesn't stop them from shooting you until they catch fire and die, as well as the TNT bundles which explode on impact, unlike Duke's pipebomb which can be detonated at any time.\n\nThere are remote detonated TNT and a lot of ammo for the hitscan weapons in later episodes, but on harder difficulties just don't expect too much use for them, as you will be using a lot of it up quickly.\n\nThe game prides itself on it's Horror atmosphere, so expect gore (hence the name of the game haha). Unlike the other Build games, using TNT to blow someone into lots of pieces, or kicking a decapitated zombie head like a football or even setting a cultist on fire and watching them panic and melt away is the best feature about this game that stands out above the others. Although there is gore in Duke Nukem 3D, it is not on the level of Blood's. The gore is very satisfying.\n\nThere is no freezethrower or shrinker or any weapons like that in Blood, oh no, there is a voodoo doll which allows you to stab it to hurt and destroy enemies, a napalm cannon which uses gasoline as ammo to fire an explosive ball of napalm which sets entire groups of enemies on fire and a tesla cannon which just obliterates enemies. Although some of the weapons in Duke Nukem 3D and Shadow Warrior are funny and unique, Blood just goes all out in painful and nasty weapons which do what you expect them to do, they are all very satisfying to use.\n\nThe enemies mainly compromise of zombies which are melee only and rather easy to kill, but can revive themselves if not killed by a flare or pitchfork. There are also the cultists which, along with the zombies, are the most common enemies you see in the game, they can throw bombs at you, shoot you with shotgun or tommy gun and generally destroy you in an open area. These enemies are actually the most difficult in the game, because they are very good with their hitscan weapons and you have to use TNT from cover or maybe tag one of them at a time using the flare gun to kill them without harming yourself too much.\n\nThe level design is excellent and has a very spooky atmosphere (2spooky4me), but there are levels ranging from an evil rollercoaster to a moving train, making each level exciting and unique to play, whereas even Duke Nukem 3D had its filler levels a lot of the time.\n\nEach episode has an end boss, the first boss is very easy, as he only fires projectiles and you can just circle strafe and shoot him to death to win, whilst the other bosses bring more to the table and forces you to be more skilled to defeat them.\n\nThe weapons, enemies and levels are all fantastic and I find this game to be the most fun to play out of the Build engine games if you enjoy gore, carnage and sadistic pleasures in setting cultists on fire, blowing them up and hearing their screams.\n\nCaleb is a fantastic protagonist who is actually still evil and has awesome voice lines, although not as quippy or as funny as Duke's or Lo Wang's, Caleb is more sinister and constantly makes sarcastic remarks when you blow up enemies or set them on fire, adding to the pleasure you get from killing enemies.\n\nHOW IS IT ON STEAM?:\nThe source code is yet to be released for Blood, therefore there is no modern sourceport that runs this game. This is the worst part about this game on Steam, as you are forced to play it on DOSbox. DOSbox works as it should but even when you freshly install it, it is highly recommended you check out these guides to get it running as best as possible on your system:\n\nGuide for fixing the game up for your system:\n\nFixes and Improvements\n\nGuide for using a launcher to easily launch the game and its expansion pack:\n\nBlood Launcher v2.3\n\nIt seems like extra effort spent better actually playing the game, but trust me, it is worth your time as you will enjoy this game.\n\nOVERALL 8/10:\nThe game itself is easily a 9/10, but the fact there is no modern sourceport due to the source code being undisclosed is what annoys me, it is all up to Atari who holds the rights for it to release it or not.\n\nBut if you enjoy good singleplayer FPS games where it is all about just obliterating everyone, whether you like classic FPS games or not or even if you don't like the Horror atmosphere, this game is very fun and you should play it.","March 3","true","7.1"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","3"

You even journey through the stomach of a living being at one point.\nAll the levels feature plenty of secrets full of goodies and feature lots of humorous references to horror novels and movies, they're also fairly lenghty and sometimes require you to collect up to 6 keys to complete which can make the levels confusing to navigate at times.\n\nWhile the graphics are certainly dated, their still more than playable even if some of the colours used can be repetitive. The music is fantastic and fits into the game perfectly and the voice of the main character adds plenty of personality to the gameplay.\nOverall Blood is a fantastic game and in my opinion is the best BUILD engine game, with over 40 levels there is lots of replay value as well.","November 7, 2014","true","2.8"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

It is a different game and is has different gameplay compared to it's brothers Shadow Warrior and Duke Nukem. A couple things I would like to note, however. The controls need a little bit of optimization (on the players part), the original music is not there, it has been replaced with some other track with lots of moaning... and I only see 5 episodes in the menu, however it appears cryptic.exe (cryptic passage expansion) is in the game files? Please explain. 8/10.(changed to 6/10 below) Would've gave it 10/10 or a 9/10 if it weren't for the minor problems.\n\nThe game is also a complete copy of the GOG.com version.  I see no differences except this requires a little more fixing in regards to the cryptic expansion mostly.  I change my rating to a 6/10 because it's a good game in itself, but there is just so much optimisation that needs to be done, and if Monolith could finally release the source code then just maybe we would have a little gem here. Oh yeah, and if you plan on getting Blood II, I wouldn't recommend that, it's mostly garbage and won't work on anything above Win XP anyway, also it's very glitchy.  I could care less if Monolith was going under when it was released.  It's simply the blunt truth.\n\nIf you are interested in getting the game fully functioning, please refer to this guide, as it was very helpful in my quest for getting the game to work at full potential:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=286998267\nOverall, it's got really fun gameplay and I haven't seen a game alot like it.

And this is where you take control of him and go on a rampage to punish your master for getting rid of you. It makes sense, right? :)\n\nThe game follows in the footsteps of Doom and Duke Nukem 3D:\n1) You eliminate hordes of enemies\n2) Once you encounter the boss you get rid of it\n3) Many weapons are at your disposal with which you can do a great massacre\n\nRinse and repeat! Oh, and not only does it look similar than above-mentioned gems from the '90s, but Blood is equally hard. F*cking hard at times.\n\nNotice how outdated this game is! Well, this is the Build engine at works which was at the time considered 2.5 dimension instead of 3. Why? Because the game only made us feel the height but rooms were always adjacent to one another (there were actually no rooms on top of another). This game is from a time where we hardly used the mouse for aiming and shooting and the movement keys were not bound to WASD.\n\nAt the time the game was a bit outdated (I believe Quake had already been released) but people needed time to get used to those. Blood, therefore, was a refreshing experience mainly because it introduced fun to the genre. It did in a different way than Duke did: while the protagonist had great one-liners he also had "clever" guns. In Blood your flamethrower is an aerosol spray and lighter combined and one of the most powerful weapon is a voodoo doll. Oh, and your only (the genre-typical and mandatory) melee weapon is not a fist or knife or a crowbar but a pitchfork.\n\nI played the Steam version a bit and it seems to be running just fine thanks to the emulator used. The game has two expansion packs with two more chapters to the already great 4 chapters. If you liked Blood back in the day grab this one quickly. If you loved all those games using the Build Engine (Duke Nukem, Shadow Warrior, Redneck Rampage, Nam etc.) but skipped this one make sure you have one of the best in the genre in your library. :)","November 1, 2014","true","0.1"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","2"

The theme of the game is horror, the kind of satanic and supposedly dark and disturbing horror but this game isn’t meant to be taken seriously at all.\n\nThe gameplay is basically the same as Duke Nukem 3d but much better, nearly everything that was in Duke 3d is in blood and used better and made to fit the theme and doesn’t suffer from any of the problems found in Duke 3d, those being: blowing yourself up too much with the rocket launcher and the tedious level design and key hunts that will have you aimlessly wondering around a level when you’ve killed everyone.\n\nBlood is also the most violent game of the 90s, and it’s really fun to group up some enemies and blow them to pieces or blow their skin off by using the napalm rocket launcher or a bundle of dynamite and have Caleb laughing like a sadistic madman.\n\nThe weapons you get consists of a pitchfork, a flair gun, a sawn off shotgun, a tommy gun, a napalm rocket launcher, three different variations of dynamite, spray cans, a telsa gun, a voodoo doll and a staff. The majority of these weapons have alternate fire, with the flair gun you can either fire one flair or fire a huge fire ball, with the shotgun you can either fire one barrel at a time or both at once, with the tommy gun you can either just plain fire it or you can fire it so it sways to the left and right which is good for a wide group of enemies, with the napalm launcher you can either fire it like a rocket launcher or a grenade launcher, with the spray cans you can either use it as a flamethrower or you can fire bomb enemies with it.\n\nWhy this game is underrated and under looked:\n\nAt the time of its release people would rather play quake 2 because it has a fully 3d engine when blood is 2.5D and the game almost became forgotten which is quite pathetic because this is a massively better game than quake 2.\n\nThere aren’t really any problems with the game itself but there are a few very small irritations with the difficulty and that being that all of the enemies with guns are pixel pin point accurate and do not miss a single shot and have really quick reactions where sometimes you’ll open a door and you get killed immediately, and with enemies that use projectiles they tent to fire to the left and right hitting you every single time since your natural reaction is to strafe left and right.\n\nIf you like old school shooters definitely get this game without a doubt it’s always fun to play.","July 21, 2014","true","52.3"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","1"

An absolute blast to play and one of the finest FPS games i've ever played.\n\nOne note however, this is not a "Remastered" version like Duke Nukem 3D Megaton Edition or Shadow Warrior Classic Redux. Since the fellas at Atari are a bunch of morons and won't release the source code to public we probably won't be seeing something like that either. However, the game runs very well on DOSBox with reasonable resolution settings and mouse look support as long as your rig isn't an absolute toaster. It also supports multiplayer via YANG or such.\n\nThe game goes for very high prices when it comes to the retail game and the Cryptic Passage expansion pack, so the price they're asking for it on Steam is more than reasonable.

Telsa gun now has dual-wielding capabilities, which the game did not have when it first came out, so this is a new (but awesome) addition. Game also comes with expansion packs which makes it even better. Cut scenes included. No multiplayer though, or at least none that I was able to immediately find, which sucks.

We play as an anti-hero protagonist called Caleb who has been betrayed by a demigod he once loyally served and has risen from the grave for vengeance. Hearing your motivation and the fact that Caleb dresses like an emo cowboy with glowing red eyes one might assume this to be a rather serious game but boy is that wrong. Nearly every word out of Caleb's mouth is either a reference to pop culture of the 90's or a witty one liner. Freshly risen from the grave your only weapon will be a pitchfork which is mostly a last resort weapon only useful against the lower tier creatures such as undead ax wielders. You'll quickly find your next weapon, a simple flare gun that once fired at an enemy will usually set it on fire within a couple of seconds.\n\nNearly every weapon has an alt-fire for added diversity and options during combat. Your simple flare gun's alt-fire allows you to shoot an exploding flare that has decent area of effect allowing you to clear out rooms in a rain of fire at the cost of more ammo than normally firing it. You'll eventually run across your run of the mill shotgun and machine gun that are staples of the FPS genre but the rest of your arsenal is much more unique and memorable ranging from holding a lighter in front of a spray can for an improvised flamethrower to a voodoo doll you jam with a needle in order to harm the enemy in front of you. Learning how to use whatever is on hand is a necessity in Blood since there is simply not enough ammo for blasting your way through the game with the normal weapons. Fire and dangerous explosions will be your best friends if you plan to survive this brutal world.\n\nAbove all skills learning how to chuck a stick of dynamite thru a window without blasting yourself is a must. Dynamite is common and is devastating to most enemies as well as great at evening the odds when you are greatly outnumbered. There is a great variety of enemies but the most common are also the most dangerous. These enemies are The Cultists and they are packing heavy weaponry like machine guns and shotguns to ruin your day. While you may be undead, getting shot in the face still hurts and will drain your health/armor in no time. The Cultist's aim is superhuman, being able to nail you right in the forehead from a huge distance with robot like reflexes and their placement in the levels further stacks the situation in their favor. If you expect something bad to happen or think that the sudden corner up ahead would be perfect for something to kill you chances are your instincts are right so be ready to fire at a moment’s notice or if you have a decent supply of dynamite chuck one to make sure there isn't a mime waiting in the shadows to strangle you.\n\nIn addition to your weapons you will have multiple items at your disposal. These range from a portable medkit to a pair of boots that allows you to jump insanely high. They can be used anytime you wish however they do have very limited use and will be gone quick if you use them excessively. Scattered around the levels are items that will be used upon picking it up such as Akimbo Guns that allows you to dual wield two of the same weapons allowing you to relive the ending to Scarface with twice the manliness. In all seriousness that power-up would have been far better as a portable item instead of an immediate since whenever I usually picked one up I either didn't need it or didn't want to waste that much ammo. The more useful ones are the invisibility that allows you to wail on the clueless enemies in ghost form and a weird floating eye that will supercharge your overall health from the typical 100 to 200. The amount of options and opportunities to annihilate your foes are massive which leads to much more engaging gameplay than just going in blasting with a shotgun.\n\nThat's not to say using the shotgun isn't fun as well. As you may imagine with a name like Blood the game is very violent and enemies just fall apart, especially when you use the alt-fire to unleash both rounds from the barrel at once to splatter the room. Sometimes their head comes off and you can kick it around like a soccer ball until it breaks apart which is admittedly yet morbidly great fun. One thing that I love about Blood is that our character just loves what he is doing and will occasionally laugh like amadman whenever he causes carnage which never fails to bring a smile to my face. The voice acting is pretty good too and it really helps Caleb's dark sense of humor. Whoever did the screaming for enemies on fire deserves some kind of acting award and it adds just that much more personality to this title.\n\nLevels in this game are enormous and are brilliantly designed. They feature your key card hunting you'd expect out of the FPS games of yesteryear and require you to pay attention to your surroundings. From a level that has you fighting your way through a moving train, a city being bombarded by planes and your more suspenseful horror themed levels Blood has a ton of levels that will stick with you far after you completed the game. It's not as simple as walking around everywhere to reach the end of a level. Multiple times you will have to go swimming underwater to reach a location which sounds like an easy task until the first time you see a giant shark with legs rapidly approaching towards you. Luckily you can still fire your guns underwater somehow but that won't be much help when you are being attacked from all sides. Fleeing out of the water does you no good as they will jump right out and run on their freakish legs as they will not be denied their feast, lack of lungs be damned.\n\nOne semi-serious flaw of the underwater sections is the lack of visual feedback telling you how close you are to being out of breath causing you to start losing health. Your screen does get slightly red but something more noticeable such as an oxygen bar would have been far more preferable. Unfortunately this version of Blood is pretty sub-par. It has many problems running on modern machines like music not looping leaving you with nothing but ambiance noise throughout, tons of screen tearing and slowdown and the final 6th episode isn't even playable in game, instead you must go to the game's directory and drag the “Cryptic.exe” to the Dosbox program. The controls have been slightly modernized and movement is now “WASD” while offering horizontal mouse view meaning you can't look up or down upon starting. Simply pressing the “U” key will allow you to look around freely and pressing the “I” key will add an aiming reticle. People say that the GOG version is better but as I don't own it I can't confirm these statements. Steam's version is not unplayable but the poor performance and screen tearing are a major detractor.\n\nIt's a shame really as this was my favorite of the trilogy of Build Engine games, the other two being Duke Nukem 3D and Shadow Warrior. Those two have been brought into the modern age and play great thanks to Devolver Digital's respect for the hit 90's shooters while Atari just plopped “Blood” onto the market, running on Dosbox with just enough tuning to make it playable. Blood is still a fun and unique game that has great level design, tons of weapons and interactive environments like workable light switches, certain walls being destructible and tons of creativity. Having 6 episodes to play through this is one title with a ton of playtime. For those of us that played this game back in the day it is a solid low costing purchase regardless of the flaws but for those looking to get into old school shooters I'd suggest to start off elsewhere.","May 20","true","20.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","1"

This was one of the dawning games for me where many great soundtracks (cd quality audio) was being put on the cd as extra tracks to listen to in your cd player. This soundtrack along with some of the extra files found online of other music of this & the sequel (Blood2 is good but it feels like it ran out of money before it was finished so you get 2/3 of a game) got me through many boring parts of college or work.

Fortunately, while the engine may be a bit creaky, the weapon selection remains one of the most entertaining and bizarre collections of kill-a-majigs ever assembled in a game.\nIt's extremely telling that Blood's designers make sure the player learns the joys of the pitchfork, flare-gun, and Dynamite well before they pick up anything as mundane as a shotgun. This is a game with more interesting things on its mind, like the Tesla Gun, the Napalm Launcher, and in one of many, many hat-tips to the game's influences, the humble-yet-devastating Aerosol and Lighter combo pack. And yet, while all of these weapons have their charms, as far as this game is concerned, Danny Dynamite is practically a second character.\nProvided in ACME-approved, bright red bundle fashion, Dynamite is a constant source of spontaneous comedy as well as giblets, as it is handed out in positively Looney-Tunesian quantities, and actively encouraged in its use. Our zombified hero hits hard, but withers quickly under gunfire, prompting a strategic approach to clearing out baddies that was remarkable for its time, especially combined with the designers' love of elaborate environments, and stashing inconvenient murderers behind newly-opened doors and false walls.\nUltimately, what makes Blood special is the moments where all these pieces come together; hunting around for a spare zombie-head to kick into the carnival game, dropping a napalm bomb right smack in the center of a horde of shrieking cultists, and perhaps most of all, the sight of a lit fuse slowly burning down in your twice-dead hands as your killers linger stupidly beside your corpse.\n\nTL/DR: If horror, black comedy, and clever design get your... ugh, blood flowing, then you'll probably enjoy this.","July 29, 2014","true","5.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

And I'm regretting to have wasted time on free to play games; I recently started playing all those Build Engine based games and Blood surely is my favourite!\n\nFirst of all the level design is amazing, so much different locations all well done and fitting to the game genre with tons of easter eggs to the horror genre that made me enjoy even as a non-fan of this genre. One downside is that in some levels you can skip some parts or obtain easily keys by using the jump boots.\n\nThe main character, Caleb, easily overcome the most famous Duke Nukem and Lo Wang. He's charismatic, he's a psycho, he's mysterious. Caleb isn't the classic good guy pwning horde of enemies, he was an elite cultist of the Cabal cult before getting betrayed by the cult god himself. In searching for revenge he'll kill everyone who tries to slow him down no matter what appear on his way, civilians as well. In this jurney Caleb will entertain you with his catchy dark humor phrases. But he'll show a more human side when he'll find his loved one lifeless body, unlikely Duke or Lo Wang\n\nThe weaponry are awsome and various by type and all have a secondary attack. You'll also have access to a selection of tools that may help you, just like the Medic Bag, Jumping Boots etc. Your first weapon will be the Pitchfork which will come handy even in further levels.\n\nthe Sawed Off Shotgun the most versatile weapon of the game, it's effective against any you surely ends up using it most of the time.\n\nFlare Gun is capable of burning any enemy made of flesh in 2 seconds if hitted correctly.\n\nThompson is the alternative to the Sawed Off as it's very accurate at high distance(perfect to blow up barrels) and it come handy with the secondary attack if you're surrounded by a lot of enemies.\n\nAereosol Can is a sort of flamethrowner for short range and as well as Dynamite and Proximity & Remote Detonator can be used to blow up group of enemies and can be launched at a fair distance.\n\nNapalm Launcher is the never missing missile launcher, but it actually fire flaming globs and exploding napal\n\nTesla Cannon, well Tesla means that it fires electric charges, it's the most powerful weapon of the game thanks to its high rate of fire and massive damages. It's a good thing keeping it only for Boss and mini-boss\n\nVodoo Doll is a magical weapon capable of hurting enemies but it will hurt you if there isn't any in your sight. It's quite useful but it can be used only few times before depleting.\n\nLife Leech is a magical staff that inflict massive damage and if you run out of ammo, it will use your blood as ammo!","March 12","true","13.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

(This is a DOSBox Game)\n\nAfter a few hours of trying I finally managed to get the game to work, I downloaded every single launcher and patcher and whatnot I could find and eventually I found out i was having an Issue with the .conf files and .cfg not having matching information causing a crash on start.\n\nInterestingly I can not make it run through the Launcher and have to use the GOGSetup.exe (Yes, this is the *exact same as the GOG version, most of the files are still called GOG something or another)\n\nIt's a fantastic game gameplay wise just like every thing on the BUILD engine but unless you are playing it for nostalgia purposes I would recommended waiting until it goes on a massive sale. (Though if your a fan of the build engine 5 dollers is fair as it's the *exact same* game you loved 17 years ago)\n\nWith that being said the Engine is more advanced that the Duke Nukem 3D or Shadow Worrior build, All wepons have secondary fireing modes, You can cook off your hand bombs and change how far you throw them, Wepons pick ups are 3d models, You can shoot enemys heads off and kick them all around on the floor and enemys can fly around and over you very fluidly.\n\nThe gameplay is great but the voice acting is a little lacking. In other Build games your character will make sexist, racest crude comments and adult humor every other kill but in this game you rarely talk.\n\nOverall I would rate this game a 8.5 out of 10. It would have got a 10/10 if You said something cool every time you blew someone up.\n\nI urge everyone to spam Atari (the guys that own the rights) and all the Old Developers and shareholders to do what is necessary to get the souse code released to the public.\n\n(Oh and thanks for all of the comments that essentialaly say "works for me your computer just sucks", you really helped me get it running.)","July 16, 2014","true","3.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","5"

Basically, what Duke Nukem 3D did with satire towards action films and Shadow Warrior did with kung fu films and anime tropes, Blood does with horror films; just about everything in the game is a parody or satire of a horror film or horror trope, from the Gothic setting, occult enemies and monsters, individual levels inspired by classic horror films, right down to a lot of secrets containing direct references to those films. The game itself looks as beautiful as a 2.5D game made for resolutions lower than 640x480 can be; texture and sprite art is incredible and the sprites are actually animated using stop-motion figurines, giving the game quite a creepy, old-fashioned feel. On that note, Blood definitely lives up to its name - one of the selling points for the game was that it is violent to the point of it being over-the-top, giving you the ability to blow enemies to pieces, set them ablaze and watch them run around screaming on fire, and even wither them to dust and kibbles with a voodoo doll. The way that every enemy is animated is really something quite special to behold.\n\nGameplay is typical of games on the Build Engine: tight, frantic and extremely fast-paced. You can kill most enemies in seconds but just about every enemy can do the same to you, so the game outright relies on your quick reflexes and ability to learn how and when to use each weapon. This game comes from a time in the mid-nineties where "innovation" was the keyword when designing FPS games, so the standard "melee, pistol, shotgun, machine gun, rocket launcher, better machine gun, BFG", loadout popularised by Doom (carried through by Quake and Serious Sam) is changed up a bit: the very first gun that you get is a flare gun, which will kill most smaller enemies with one shot but takes a few seconds to start them burning, and that's the closest thing that you'll ever get to a standard pistol; while there is a typical rocket launcher-like weapon, you also get several different types of dynamite that you can throw, light and drop or use to set traps for enemies (and even the rocket launcher that you find is actually a napalm launcher). As you can see from the screenshots, you'll also find a voodoo doll, which actually works a bit more like a hitscan pistol than the flare gun does. Sometimes, these weird weapon designs can seem a little gimmicky or clunky to use, but just about every weapon is balanced, has its place and uses during combat and is extremely fun to use.\n\nLike any other Build Engine game, the level design is beautiful, fun and very creative. As classic 2.5D FPS games tended to do, Blood expects you to explore, remember where doors are for when you find their keys and travel around the levels to open up new areas beyond places you've already been, rather than ushering you down a single corridor. There is (generally) only one intended way to complete a map, but it still feels a heck of a lot more open-ended than the FPS games of recent years. You're also rewarded for exploring - as they should be, secrets are abundant, and it's actually rare for any single level to have less than 6-8 secret areas. Blood also tried (and, sadly, failed) to introduce the concept of "super secrets" to games, which are deliberately ridiculously hard to find on your own and aren't even shown on the end-of-level tally so you won't know if you've missed one, but will reward you in turn with things like receiving a very powerful weapon early or getting every single powerup in the game at once. Just searching for secrets on its own is a huge factor in the fun of Blood.\n\nSadly, the game was somewhat overshadowed by virtue of it being a DOS game released right at the end of the DOS era and a 2.5D game released after Quake's true 3D environments, but, overall, if you can stomach some hyperviolence (why would you be looking at a game called Blood if you couldn't?), don't mind some slightly clunky early FPS mechanics (why would you be looking at an FPS from the nineties if you did?) and don't mind that the game runs in DOSBox (the source code was never released, sadly, so we'll most likely never see a true Windows-native source port like Doom, Duke3D and Shadow Warrior have), I would highly recommend this game to get your frantic FPS action fix.","May 19","true","15.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

However, I think Duke Nukem 3D had the superiority in guns (Apart from tossing dynamites, which is close to a tie for me on Pipebombs.) because I found myself with much less supply and ranged abilities in Blood. In comparison to Doom and Duke; Blood doesn't give the player the classic "pistol-start", and instead gives them a melee weapon; which is useful and easy on anything that doesn't have too much mobility or ranged weaponry. (But to me, it's like trying to kick monsters in Duke. It requires aim, and practice.)\n\nThe cons about this game must be that it's made for DOS, thus making it more complex and limited to play for new users.

I have spend thousands of hours on it since I was a kid, glad to see it finally hit Steam.\n\nI'm on Win7 64 bit and having no issues with sound, graphics or any of the other problems some people have listed.\n\nThe super dark backdrop and the spooky music is great, but what makes this my favorite game over all others is the weapons have alternate firing modes accessed by hitting X.\n\n1. Pitchfork\n2. Flare Gun X-Shot = Diamond Pattern of 7 flairs.\nFlare gun had the chance to set enemies on fire, causing them to take DOT and burn into a pile of ashes. Certain enemies, like the Cerberus were immune to burning.\n3. Sawed off double barrel shotgun. X-Shot = Both Barrels at once, very deadly when using the "Guns Akimbo" pickup.\n4. Tommy Gun X-Shot = Spraying side to side with it. (not that effective)\n5. Napalm Launcher\n6. Dynamite X-Shot = Dropping it at your feet.\nDynamite had a lot of options and tactical uses, there are 3 types of Dynamite in blood. Regular light and throw/drop (if you lit one before dying, IE you see your death coming and your enemy running at you you could light one, die, kill anyone close to you) . Proximity mines (yes they would blow up on you, they had a couple seconds delay, if you were running you could drop them behind you. Killed any player instantly if they have no armor, hide them behind doors, corners, etc.) And finally remote bombs, you could use these to trigger a line of bombs or all the ones you have laid if you are dropping them with the X Key.\n7. Hair Spray + Lighter (Flame thrower) X-Shot = Breaking the top off, lighting and throwing, creating a fire ball that catches anything in the blast on fire.\n8. Tesla Cannon (Fast fire like the plasma rifle in Doom), X-Shot = A charged electric burst, would cause enemies to light up like in an X-Ray, could see their bones and what not. Very powerful\n9. Soul Leech, would fire until you ran out of ammo then leech your health down to about 5-10 points as ammo. X-Shot = 2 more modes, 1 would fire a different pattern and 2 would plant it in the ground, firing at anyone who got close, like a turret.\n0. Voo-Doo Doll, you would prick the doll, lowering your own life but causing major harm, would also make characters slow down, stumble. X-Shot = Waves hand over doll, uses it up, kills instantly whoever you are looking at.","October 27, 2014","true","0.8"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hamakei/recommended/299030/","hamakei","Hamakei","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hamakei/","1098 products in account","I have a confession to make. I love all four of the "main" BUILD games. Duke, Shadow Warrior, Blood and Redneck Rampage all have their own unique character and style, despite being basically the same games with different art and sounds. The last two unfortunately seem to be owned by companies who aren't interesting in using what they've got, which is a shame. Despite Duke and SW both having their source code releases, we've had no such luck with Blood and RR. There are are a couple of exploratory games which are attempting to remake Blood, but without access to the source code, they just don't *feel* right. As as everybody knows, "feel" is very important with an FPS. So, the only way to play Blood for now is through DOSBox.\n\nLuckily modern computers are powerful enough to run DOSBox without a glitch, so Blood can now be played faithfully on near enough any x86 based machine you want. Which is good, as Blood is amazing. Whilst Duke is based on guns'n'muscle action movies and SW is schlocky kung fu, Blood is low-budget gory horror movies. So think... Evil Dead 2 - The Game. That's about what we're dealing with. So, your character quotes one-liners whilst kicking a zombie's head across the graveyard. You can use an aerosol as an improvised flamethrower, set people on fire with flare guns, and wield two guns at once, Woo-style. This is not a game that takes itself seriously.\n\nThe level design is wonderful, with plenty of variety in locations - my favourites being the "house of horrors" secret level, and the train from the first Episode. Sound design is well done as usual, with the cultists spouting a conlang made for the game, and nice atmospheric music.\n\nUnfortunately at this point the Build engine was starting to show it's age, and some of the graphical workarounds don't really work - particularly things like the train cars. Still, it's fun. And that's what's important.","February 26, 2015","true","0.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are tons of references to major horror films such as The Evil Dead 1 & 2, Return of The Living Dead, The Shining, Jaws, Frankenstien and many more. The plot is pretty simple, you got screwed over by the devil or something and you want to make him pay...preferably by choking him with his own intestines. The game is a simple Doom clone but with a little more 3-D rendered objects, for example, the keys, weapons, and some pickups are actually 3-D models and not 2-D sprites. The gore is pretty high in this game as well, so if you like that well here you go. I have a couple complaints with older games like this is, one of them is that it has to run in DOS-Box, however DOS-Box is prepacked with the game so you don't have to go and download it, just install and play. Another gripe is that when I am playing I can't find a way to use the mouse for aiming so I have to stick with awkward controls. Besides those small issues the game holds up pretty well today.

Cultists with different weapon variations, flying fast gargoyles, zombies that actually rise up again if not dispatched good enough and those reaper ghosts are like secret OP bosses hidden throughout the game, Gameplay wise its still over the top.\n\nSadly the actual owner of the licence sucks so bad (Atari) to make a sequel or even a decent sourceport like Duke Nukem Megaton or Shadow warrior redux, and they've already said they have no interest in doing anything with it anytime soon.

Developed by Monolith Productions and published by GT Interactive(Now known as Atari) and Eidos Interactive in 1998. One Unit Whole Blood is powered by the same engine that ran Duke Nukem 3D and Shadow Warrior.\n\nBlood is still a favourite of many, holding heaps of unique characteristics, even to this day. Before the gaming industry really began taking itself seriously due to a very small scale market, games like this could be released that was more-so what the designer personally wanted; a crazy, fun, senseless violence filled shooter.\n\nStory: You soul is shredded and palmed off to a dark god whose only reward to you was empty promises, false claims and betrayal, and whoes ultimate goal was to completely eliminate humankind. Now, the only way you can settle the score and have your revenge is blood being spilled. Zombies, gargoyles, demons, hellhounds, cultists or even innocent bystanders, none are spared from your vengeful wrath.\n\nSoundtrack: Wonderful ambiance ties in perfectly with the cheesy one liners and the all round atmosphere of the game.\n\nMenu: As chunky as any classic game running through DOSbox. Not that many options but a decent amount for it's time.\n\nGameplay: Running rampent through 4 episodes each filled with 8-9 maps, starting with "The Way of All Flesh" and finishing with "Dead Rockoning" you face up against a vast range of foes(e.g; Zombies, Cultists, Hellhounds etc.) with a charming array of unique weapons(e.g; Pitchfork, Sawed-off shotgun, Voodoo Doll etc.) my personal favourite being the iconic pitchfork. It's senseless gore, non-serious plot, classic FPS horror.\n\nGraphics: On par with Doom and Shadow Warrior, it's the classic pixely goodness you've come to know and love. It was amazing for it's time, and honestly, it still is.\n\nFinal Conclusion: A classic must play for anyone into the FPS genre or just after some difficult gore-filled fun.","October 27, 2015","true","4.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's literally a DOSBOX port of the game, The music audio is so loud that it will over power everything else in the game and deafen you even if you turn the game down to almost nothing. The controls need to be reconfigured before you can play and then sometimes the keys just get stuck and you'll be walking forward continuously.\n\nIt saddens me as this is a great game but because of it's outdated control's and windowing issues and ear bleedingly loud audio makes it impossible to enjoy. Truely a waste.\n\nThis version of the game provides all the episodes but it's not reworked like Duke Nukem Megaton edition or Shadow warrior Redux, it's the barebones 1990's version before WASD was a thing and Mouse aiming wasn't a thought in anyones mind. It's just barely playable and it's more so like being tortured than having fun.\n\nIt would be nice if who ever published this asked the team that did Shadow Warrior Redux to rework this game to run with out DOSBOX and fixed some of the frustrating and cumbersome issues that come along with it.\n\nI get it, It's "Old School" but Duke and Shadow Warrior are old school as well and got Modern control and minor graphical upgrades to make those games look pleasent and run and control as they should. Sad to say This is one to avoid until someone does a decent update to this game so it can run properly and isn't just a DOSBOX port.\n\nSkip this one and go watch a lets play of it, save your self the headache and the waste of a few dollars.","September 8, 2015","false","0.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I'd rather wanna tell you why I quit it after 6 minutes of gameplay and never touched it again. It's hard to bore me, it's hard to get me to quit a game because of it's graphics, gameplay or story. What gets me to do that is poor execution at the top of its class.\n\nFirst off: The game could be great. It really could be great. Sure, it's a bit like a ripoff of Doom but still. It's an old FPS with a nice atmosphere. And the graphics are nice, too. I'll say it again: it could be a good game. But...\nHow do I put this? Remember what happened to the classic Doom games when they got on modern systems and such? Right: they received updates to enhance performance and controls. Blood doesn't have that.\nIn Blood, you control the whole game with your keyboard. No mouse support whatsoever. I mean come on! Even Doom could do this.\nControlling a game with only your keyboard wouldn't be too bad if it wasn't an FPS. To control an FPS without a mouse and just, for instance, the arrow keys, is a chore. And in this game it sure is a chore. It's a pain in the ♥♥♥ to control your movements or to aim up or down.\n\nThen there's the resolution settings. It is set to 800x600 by default. If you're like me and your monitor isn't from the 80's you'll be weirded out if trying to set the resolution any higher, even if the option is there. Why? Because if you set the resolution to, for instance, 1280x1024, instead of a full screen experience in a higher resolution you get tons of miniature screens packed side by side and you can't see anything. Not that it matters anyway, it's just so damn pointless.\n\nAside from that the little bit of gameplay I experienced wasn't all too good either because the enemies are frickin' bullet sponges (at least in the starting area) and, because of the wacky controls, it's hard to hit anything and your ammo is depleted quickly without you even hitting an enemy.\n\nTo conclude:\nThe controls are horrendous. It may have rebindable keys but playing an FPS with just your keyboard is excruciating. This one little thing ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off so much that I can not recommend this game since it's next to unplayable if you want to have a decent amount of fun and don't wanna waste time turning around for an hour and a half because it doesn't have mouse support.","January 18, 2015","false","0.1"," 4 of 13 people (31%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","31","4","13","2","2"

The story, as you would expect for a typical 90’s shooter is not of significant importance. It is as far-fetched as the overall theme of the game. You control a gunslinger, once worshiper of a demonic occult who was betrayed and killed by the dark God he was worshiping, now somehow resurrected he seeks revenge.\n\nThe game is split into episodes, as it was common in those days. Through short cinematics at the end of each episode you get the progress of the story . From the  start of the game the horror and violent themes are easily noticeable. There is a lot of graphical violence and gore blended with comical aspects quite successfully I have to say. Also for a game that came out in 1997 the work on textures and lightening effects is quite impressive with the level designers packing as much detail as possible in most of the environments. In some aspects the game was really ahead of its time, like for instance the destructible environments. Most of the things can either blow up or be set on fire. However as the game progresses the strong themes of the first two episodes decline which is really a shame because there are several memorable levels in the game. The atmosphere in general is what makes this game unique and distinctive from the other doom clones of that era. The music fits perfectly with the art design as it gives a mysterious and a dark tone to the overall creepy theme.\n\nThe player has to choose from a big arsenal of weapons with unique and creative functions. There is also a secondary fire mode which was quite original at the time as it is actually a useful installment that offers diversity. However many of the weapons are weak and are just there for novelty purposes. One of the biggest flaws of the game in my opinion is its insane difficulty. Some of the enemies not only are brutally overpowered but they also have pinpoint accuracy and even at the medium difficulty settings you must be ready to die many times. It will also take some time to get used to the throwing mechanics but once you do there is nothing more entertaining than lining up a bunch of enemies and lighting them on fire or blow them up with a dynamite.  There are also some issues with the mouse aiming. Installing the bmouse application helped a lot but still, the mouse movement, especially the vertical axis just doesn’t feel right. I had to tweak it a lot to make it work decently with the rest of the movements.\n\nIt goes without saying that Blood isn’t a perfect shooter obviously. It has a somehow limited appeal which is not to be taken seriously, an unforgivable difficulty level and many other flaws but aside that it is a solid old school shooter which delivers non stop action and mindless fun.","February 9, 2015","true","27.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I am NOT a 'Bloodite' or particularly a fan of any of the 90s FPSs as most of them were from before my time. However, I'm not exactly ignorant to games such as Half Life, Deus Ex, Unreal Tournament, Timesplitters, etc. So it's not like I favor today's overglorified rail shooters over the classics.\nI'm saying this, because my major criticism for this game may be overlooked or even laughed at by people who enjoy games such as Doom, Strife and... Noah's Ark 3D.\n\nAnyway, that disclaimer aside, this game's control scheme, for me is unplayable. I can't make sense of it, at least not for very long. I'm not sure, since I don't have much experience and this may have been a pretty standard control scheme for the time but it's dated to say the least. What bugs me is that there's no way to change the controls yourself, which is fine, I don't need to have to map out the buttons myself, so long as a functional alternative control scheme is provided. They really should have added one in the steam release as a patch, I don't see that being too difficult to be honest.\n\nThe control scheme makes this game feel prehistoric for me and I found that the only way to progress through the game was to save, every time I cleared a room. This is mainly because I'm used to the modern standard of WASD to move and this control layout just throws that out of the window and encourages you to use the arrow keys, something that I was always taught NOT to do growing up.\n\nHowever, in spite of this, I still enjoyed the game. It's bright, colourful, fun and I'd be a liar if I said that the concept of playing as an undead cowboy who likes to sing show tunes whilst redecorating the walls with other people's entrails didn't appeal to me. I was always interested in this franchise and I was quite happy to see that this game came out on Steam and that it was in the sale at the time.\n\nI know that I must have enjoyed the game, because in spite of the crippling control scheme, I stuck with it for hours, until I got really deep into the game. However, dying over and over again soon got old, shooters like this are only fun if you get a flow going and no momentum can ever be kept up, so long as you get killed off, because your brain is trying to play Half Life and accidentally pressed the button to make Caleb pull his trousers down.\n\nI understand that some people might be thinking 'well, don't play it like you would a modern FPS, embrace the old school control scheme' but that's not possible. I was able to do that and get into the zone for a while but it's like trying to fly a plane, when you only have a driver's licence. Yeah it's the same in theory but once you take off the rules completely change. I know that the knee jerk response would be to say 'well you can play a range of FPS games, so why can't you play this?' Well, to rephrase your question to fit the analogy, 'well you could drive a car, so why can't you fly a plane?'\n\nOverall, I'd recommend Blood to anyone who knows what I'm talking about and laughed at my feeble attempt to understand a control scheme, that was probably being designed around the time that Harvey was premiering at the pictures but anyone else, I'd say that I'm not exadurating, with my complaints on the control scheme.\n\nIf you're unsure, I'd get this in the sale as I would say that it's worth your time, if you're able to play it, even if you're only able to play it really badly like I am but if you struggle with regular FPS games, then I doubt that you have much hope with this one.","February 6, 2015","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","5"

The reason I opened my review like that is because I have a conflict of interests about  Blood. Is it a revived FPS gem from the good ol' days of DOSBOX, or is it just another B-grade doom-esque horror FPS with pixelated graphics and ♥♥♥♥♥ controls? It's all a matter of OPINION! e.g If you were about 10 in 1981 when Blood was out (it was reasonably obscure) and loved every gory, intense moment of it, (if you got to play it, that is) then you'll love this revival of an FPS gem. However, if you were born around 1990 you won't fully appreciate it, and if you were born around 2000 you won't understand why in hell anyone would play such a low-res, crusty old game.","April 16, 2015","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I got my game back thanks to Steam!\n\n\nAnyways, to the review; what can I say about this game? It's a hidden gem from the 90s made by the people who brought you Duke Nukem and Lo Wang's Shadow Warrior (and much more). As I mentioned above, it's exactly as it was when I last played it, except it's much more bloodier and gorier than ever (because the "violent" editions were hard to get thanks to some "concerned consumers"). Gameplay-wise, for gamers who aren't familiar with the games of the 90s, you'll find it a bit tough to get used to because mouse aiming was something that was still "in development"; but nevertheless, it's very easy to get used to and it's even more fun to utilize a deadly arsenal of weapons, from a pitchfork to a voodoo doll to even a spray can flamethrower that doubles as a firebomb.\n\nBut unfortunately, there's some downsides. You see, seeing that this game is actually run on a DosBOX emulator, you can see that the actual game files are really old, which can be a serious problem for people with newer systems. The irony is that when I tried to run Blood on my gaming laptop (with windows 8.1 and some high end bells and whistles and high end graphics cards), the game would lag unbelievably to the point where it's very difficult to play (as if it isn't challenging trying to avoid a zombie's axe). Thankfully though, I have a older PC with me that runs windows 7 with inferior graphics cards and it runs beautifully. My point? If you have a system with the most recent windows (8 or 8.1) that can run games like Skyrim, Battlefield 4 or even Wolfenstein TNO without any lag of sort, then it's very likely you'll have lag problems that will be very difficult to solve. I'd best advise you have either an older computer or a system that's DOS games friendly, otherwise your blood will start to boil (get it?).","May 3, 2015","true","12.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is a BUILD engine game, the same that created DN3D.  I'd like to say this is just horror DN3D but I don't think that does this justice.  The weapons as far as I know were totally unique at the time.  Instead of the classic pistol you get a flare pistol...the flares STICK to enemies and will eventually light them on fire!!!  It is SO satisfying when you light a fanatic or cultist on fire and listen to them scream IT BURNS IT BURNS!!!  Lol.  I think all weapons have an alt fire which as I said was original.  The dbl barrel shotgun fired 2 shots or BOTH barrels so it was like having both types of shotguns from DOOM 2 in one weapon.  The tommy gun you could swing from side to side which was useful in rooms with lots of enemies and you could dual weild (from powerups) 2 weapons at a time so that kinda acts like double damage too.  When you weild 2 shotguns it's like an automatic shotgun.  I could go on about the weapons, there is a lot.  Also there are different TYPES of damage...fire, spirit and normal.  This changes how you fight with enemies.  The game is called BLOOD for a reason, the gore is outstanding.  Pretty amusing to blow somebody up and watch all their parts fly.  Great graphics, music, sound and AMAZING level design.  If you like F.E.A.R., No One Lives Forever or AVSP2 then you might like this too, made by the same people, MONOLITH Productions.","April 5, 2015","true","15.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I got my game back thanks to Steam!\n\n\nAnyways, to the review; what can I say about this game? It's a hidden gem from the 90s made by the people who brought you Duke Nukem and Lo Wang's Shadow Warrior (and much more). As I mentioned above, it's exactly as it was when I last played it, except it's much more bloodier and gorier than ever (because the "violent" editions were hard to get thanks to some "concerned consumers"). Gameplay-wise, for gamers who aren't familiar with the games of the 90s, you'll find it a bit tough to get used to because mouse aiming was something that was still "in development"; but nevertheless, it's very easy to get used to and it's even more fun to utilize a deadly arsenal of weapons, from a pitchfork to a voodoo doll to even a spray can flamethrower that doubles as a firebomb.\n\nBut unfortunately, there's some downsides. You see, seeing that this game is actually run on a DosBOX emulator, you can see that the actual game files are really old, which can be a serious problem for people with newer systems. The irony is that when I tried to run Blood on my gaming laptop (with windows 8.1 and some high end bells and whistles and high end graphics cards), the game would lag unbelievably to the point where it's very difficult to play (as if it isn't challenging trying to avoid a zombie's axe). Thankfully though, I have a older PC with me that runs windows 7 with inferior graphics cards and it runs beautifully. My point? If you have a system with the most recent windows (8 or 8.1) that can run games like Skyrim, Battlefield 4 or even Wolfenstein TNO without any lag of sort, then it's very likely you'll have lag problems that will be very difficult to solve. I'd best advise you have either an older computer or a system that's DOS games friendly, otherwise your blood will start to boil (get it?).","May 3, 2015","true","12.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story, as you would expect for a typical 90’s shooter is not of significant importance. It is as far-fetched as the overall theme of the game. You control a gunslinger, once worshiper of a demonic occult who was betrayed and killed by the dark God he was worshiping, now somehow resurrected he seeks revenge.\n\nThe game is split into episodes, as it was common in those days. Through short cinematics at the end of each episode you get the progress of the story . From the  start of the game the horror and violent themes are easily noticeable. There is a lot of graphical violence and gore blended with comical aspects quite successfully I have to say. Also for a game that came out in 1997 the work on textures and lightening effects is quite impressive with the level designers packing as much detail as possible in most of the environments. In some aspects the game was really ahead of its time, like for instance the destructible environments. Most of the things can either blow up or be set on fire. However as the game progresses the strong themes of the first two episodes decline which is really a shame because there are several memorable levels in the game. The atmosphere in general is what makes this game unique and distinctive from the other doom clones of that era. The music fits perfectly with the art design as it gives a mysterious and a dark tone to the overall creepy theme.\n\nThe player has to choose from a big arsenal of weapons with unique and creative functions. There is also a secondary fire mode which was quite original at the time as it is actually a useful installment that offers diversity. However many of the weapons are weak and are just there for novelty purposes. One of the biggest flaws of the game in my opinion is its insane difficulty. Some of the enemies not only are brutally overpowered but they also have pinpoint accuracy and even at the medium difficulty settings you must be ready to die many times. It will also take some time to get used to the throwing mechanics but once you do there is nothing more entertaining than lining up a bunch of enemies and lighting them on fire or blow them up with a dynamite.  There are also some issues with the mouse aiming. Installing the bmouse application helped a lot but still, the mouse movement, especially the vertical axis just doesn’t feel right. I had to tweak it a lot to make it work decently with the rest of the movements.\n\nIt goes without saying that Blood isn’t a perfect shooter obviously. It has a somehow limited appeal which is not to be taken seriously, an unforgivable difficulty level and many other flaws but aside that it is a solid old school shooter which delivers non stop action and mindless fun.","February 9, 2015","true","27.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its looks in general resemble something like Duke Nukem 3d and its feel is something Quake. Secondly, Its storyline is more along the lines of a horror based genre than anything to do with what other shooting games would be like. Its about a gunslinger of a supernatural form and nature who is first betrayed and killed, but then he comes back to life from the grave to seek violent revenge on those who killed him, those which happened to be other supernatural forms of characters. There is really good shooting and close quarters combat enjoyment in it throughout but with only one very important catch... you need a compatible machine that will enable  the game to run properly for you. If you dont have the correct form of machine to get it working for you then the game will either mess up on you all the time and will waist your time trying to get it working outright or worse of all, never open for you. Enough said. Having said that, absolutely brilliant old-school shooter with plenty of non-stop enjoyable action, adult humour and violent fun.","February 14","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You play as a nameless character who to my knowledge is trying to save his loved one that was taken from him, but that really it for story. You will be getting you kicks from watching your enemies blow into piles of blood and gore as you kick decapitated heads around for the sick fun of it you little psychopath\n\nPros.\n-Horror elements are very present in this game\n-A truck load of guns and other goodies to be used\n-Five campaigns to enjoy\n-So many different enemies to kill! From Zombies to Fish men to Grim Reapers\n-Good amount of Easter eggs\n\nCons.\n-Moving around levels to find an exit or door can be hard at times\n-When you first install the game you will need to reedit the controls because they will be set to as if you were using an Atari controller\n\nOver all if you are thinking on getting this game for whatever reason in the whole wide world do it! It's cheap and packs hours of blood curdling fun.\n\nThank you for reading\n","June 24, 2015","true","13.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its looks in general resemble something like Duke Nukem 3d and its feel is something Quake. Secondly, Its storyline is more along the lines of a horror based genre than anything to do with what other shooting games would be like. Its about a gunslinger of a supernatural form and nature who is first betrayed and killed, but then he comes back to life from the grave to seek violent revenge on those who killed him, those which happened to be other supernatural forms of characters. There is really good shooting and close quarters combat enjoyment in it throughout but with only one very important catch... you need a compatible machine that will enable  the game to run properly for you. If you dont have the correct form of machine to get it working for you then the game will either mess up on you all the time and will waist your time trying to get it working outright or worse of all, never open for you. Enough said. Having said that, absolutely brilliant old-school shooter with plenty of non-stop enjoyable action, adult humour and violent fun.","February 14","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
