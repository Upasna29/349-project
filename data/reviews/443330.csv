"http://steamcommunity.com/id/narucch/recommended/443330/","narucch","☆ Naruchin ☆","http://steamcommunity.com/id/narucch/","120 products in account","Very peculiar kinetic novel heavy on the slice of life and with just enough horror over the three 'codes' or acts to keep you hooked. You need to play it three times in order to get a better understanding of the plot, as the clues are scattered in the three routes (took me 4 hours in total). Each route is different from the others, and are in order Yuri's, Suzukake's and Yae's.\nFrom what I've understood, while each route gives clues to the main mystery, they are all possible outcomes and there is no 'true' route. Some things are left hanging or get unanswered, which makes the puzzling together fun but a bit frustrating. But as the virus says, no matter how much we fail, we will always try to crack the code.\nThe characters are well established and consistent, and you get to know them really well in their own routes. The visuals are  well done, with the e-mote system being smooth and truly giving life to the characters. There are plenty of CGs and they are partially animated as well.\nThe soundtrack was quite small but fit the scene well. Very good voicing!\nIt's a very polished product that occasionally breaks the fouth wall, has some memorable lines (almost everything that comes off Yae's mouth) and is intriguing enough to be finished in one sitting. It was different in a positive and welcome way, as to be expected by this publisher :)","May 6","true","4.4"," 37 of 40 people (93%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","93","37","40","4","0"

The characters are cute and have some decent development, although I thought the story was rather convoluted at times. In some ways, its very similar to Tokyo School Life, in terms of plot (a foreigner coming to Japan, etc).\nToo bad it is rather short (about 5-10 hours or so), but I guess I'm just saying that because I am used to long VN's. :-)\nAnyway, if you liked TSL or Nekopara, then you will like this.","May 14","true","8.1"," 25 of 27 people (93%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","93","25","27","3","2"

Storywise, it suffers. You won't find an easy to consume or understand story in Malus Code. It seems to take plot twists randomly, which are great for humorous effect but don't make for much of a compelling story.\n\nThere are multiple times in the story where the plot sets itself up to study petri dishes, investigate odd medication, or check out strange ramen produced by a pharmaceutical company, but it never happens. It feels like this game was written quickly and haphazardly, and I urge you to pay attention and take note of everytime this game throws pointless red herrings in your face.\n\nJust like Malus Code, this review has a twist in it. I highly recomend you buy this game and read it through. IT'S AMAZING. CHRIST. So funny. Be warned that there is no romance or the like, just unbridled so bad it's good.","May 7","true","6.0"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","71","10","14","3","0"

There are no choices or routes, you read what happens in the story and that's it. Their are a total of 3 chapters and by the end there will still be many questions left un answered, so don't expect to leave feeling 'complete'.\n\nThe story takes a lot of basic slice of life elements and mixes them with very brief mystery and horror sub plots. The mysteries never get fully resolved and the horror ends almost as quickly as it begins. Though these portions are highly interesting, they don't happen or last long enough to really leave a lasting impact other then more questions that won't be answered.\n\nA very quick and slightly entertaining read, I can't recommend it at this price.

Warning: spoiler (!)\n\nTo be fair this virtual novel is really good and have a particular plot which make this  novel unique even at some point i was literally trying to find what was going on in each route and what will the protagonist will do and also how the main protagonist will react. In my personal opinion ,for the story, the chap.3 is the best but sadly have a lack of romance compare to the others 2 chapiter.I know this VN do not necessarily focus on it but it kinda dissapointing to have some kind of dating between the protagonist and the character's route like on yuri's route and in Suzukake's route but almost nothing for Yae's one which is kinda sad.and for the 2 first chapiter was a real horror's playground which was great in my opinion because it  never had show anykind  of horror before the end of chapiter 1  and also the fact even the main menu changed into something very ''special'' i should say is pretty cool ! Also really like it how the game try to explain thing in a scientist way.\n\nThe only cons for this game are probably the facts that this game is short, if you like to choose your route this game may make you dissapointed, if your into a romantic virtual novel this game probably (or not) made you think  you wasted your cash or if you hate science or any type of game which try to learn you something  it may possibly make your cringe or rage allitle inside.If  you hate cross-dresser in VN you should totally pass for this one.And Finally if you like classic VN and dislike complex plot and stuff you should also pass for this one.\n\nThere are a lot of thing to talk about but i think i rode too much so i will stop  and rate this game 8.5/10 mostly good but have some problems to solve for next game or possibly( possibly not) an DLC ?!
