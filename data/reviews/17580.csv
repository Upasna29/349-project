Nothing plays like this game. It's objective based and takes place in 2 dimensions. In the physical world, you get all sorts of very cool futuristic weaponry and abilities like radars, sonars, invisibility, medical implants, heat-vision, etc. You can throw spidernades, direct rockets in your enemie's face, rocketfist their ♥♥♥, mow them down, desintegrate, electrify, bomb, chop them down as a bunnyhoppin cyberninja, whatever! And you can hack into the virtual world where you rocket jump, run like sonic and get into wall-running MLG-pro psychedelic laserfights.\n\nEverything is fine-tuned, there is voice commands, the weapons are a pleasure to use and the way the mod plays is simply beautiful. Also, the music is pretty boss. It makes all the cyberman-shooting look cool.","November 26, 2013","true","17.5"," 98 of 110 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","98","110","3","0"

Yet, I'm writing a review for it. This is because I played the old version of Dystopia, before it had a store page. Dystopia is an incredibly important game to me, in that it is the game that got me to play PC games. Before Dystopia, I didn't know that PC was really a gaming platform. I remember being at my Mom's boyfriend's house, and hanging out with his child (who was almost twice my age) and watching him play it. I was blown away by the futuristic look of everything, and all the little secrets he knew about in the community-made levels. Not to mention, watching him hack whilst in cyberspace just seemed incredible to the eight or nine year old me. So, I wanted to play it. So I got Steam. But I couldn't play it, because it wasn't a stand-alone game. It was a mod. So I needed Half-Life 2. But I couldn't run Half-Life 2, and by proxy Dystopia, because my PC was trash at the time. Finally, I obtained a PC that I could play Dystopia on, and... it was dead. Hardly anyone played it. The game had died by the time I was finally able to get around to playing it. So there I was, 11 or so years old, unable to properly play the game I had up until then so longed to play and I thought to myself, "Well... I guess I could try out this Half-Life 2 game. Maybe it will be alright. The guy on the cover looks like a nerd though..."\nSo that's why Dystopia is important to me. Not only did it get me to start playing PC games in general, but it got me to start playing PC games on what is perhaps the greatest game of all time. So, even if it's still dead, I have to thank it for that. And maybe, just maybe, some day it will be revived and I'll be able to -really- play the game.","May 9, 2014","true","1.6"," 71 of 78 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","71","78","0","3"

Wait for sale, buy friend copy of HL2 and tell them to play it with you OR tell them to play the mod with you if they have HL2.\n4.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/oatterz/recommended/17580/","oatterz","Oatmeal","http://steamcommunity.com/id/oatterz/","143 products in account","When I browse around for a game or mod with this type of setting (sci-fi, cyber punk, future fantasy), i see so many games that look pretty with hyper-stylized artwork. The character models seems to be a mash up of every sci fi flick + anime/manga ever made. They come complete with a trailer that was cut and directed by/for an audience with a mental maturity level that never advanced beyond grade school. I am impressed by their focus but I have been repeatedly disappointed by such lack of effort when it comes to game play.\n\nI present to you Dystopia, a diamond of a game hidden in the endless sea of mediocrity. This game is OLD, however, it hasa aged quite well. Developed many years ago for the original source engine, and has since been updated to the more current engine.\n\nIt is hard to ask for more depth in Dystopia's game play. A Wonderful mixture of intense combat and teambased strategy. Pick your class of combatant and fight in meatspace (physical world) with a powerful and diversified arsenal. Modify your current loadout with balanced system of cybernetic implants that can give you huge bursts of speed and jump height, or give you predator-style optical stealth camoflauge, or thermal vision to track heat signatures of stealthed enemies, or.. the Cyberdeck implant.\n\nThe Cyberdeck implant is the real game changer. Not only do you fight in the physical "Meatspace", the cyberdeck implant allows the user to "Deck" in to Cyberspace of a terminal that gains access to something in the Meatspace such as thermal turrents (see what i did there?), control power or unlock doors and paths to certain objectives, enable a fusion ray to vaporize enemies in its path, or even launch a nuke to end the game.\n\nCyberdeck users dont have it easy though, because if you can deck in, so can the enemy. Combat your enemy even in Cyberspace over the controll of the terminal, and Cybercombat is a whole different ball game..\n\nSo much depth, so many variables, so many scenarios each map presents. This game is ripe for eSport, as the community hosted its own Dystopia Global League (DGL) many years ago, only to fall due to lack of exposure and player base.\n\nThe developers and the core community is quite small but extremely loyal and supportive. I am proud to be one of those that has contributed to the development of the game (albeit just a small monitary contribution).\n\nI wish this recommendation entices you to try Dystopia. You will definitely enjoy it as I have for nearly 8 years now.","October 19, 2014","true","127.1"," 49 of 53 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","49","53","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shnur/recommended/17580/","shnur","[wang] Explosive Kyushu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shnur/","320 products in account","When Dystopia came out in 2005 as a mod for the then brand-spankin'-new Half-Life 2, the screen shots looked cool enough that I decided to use a gigantic chunk of my internet's monthly download limit (gg, Aussie internet) to give it a try.\n\nWhat followed absolutely set my personal bench mark for online FPS games for the next decade.\n\nIt may be just a mod, and it may have been released by a small team- but make no mistake. 10 years later, there hasn't been a single multiplayer game released that even comes remotely close to touching Dystopia in terms of how good it is. Halo and CoD with their multi-million dollar budgets? Get that ♥♥♥♥ out of here. It's not even on the same planet, and I say that as a player of both. That this mod died out never having recieved the attention it deserved is one of gaming's biggest unknown tragedies.\n\nThe split objective system which sees each team attempting to take objectives in both the real world and the cyber world requires a level of coordination and teamwork that no FPS has even attempted to recreate since. You can dominate on the field as much as you want, blasting the other team to kingdom come as soon as they respawn- but unless you have a guy in cyberspace that knows what he's doing to get those doors open for you, you aren't going anywhere near the objective, sorry. The thrill of successfully sneaking behind enemy lines to find a hacking terminal that you can use to quickly unlock an unwatched backdoor or call an elevator to let in your friends with the big guns is a huge rush.\n\nThe class system lets you choose from a standard 3-class list (light, medium, heavy) each with it's own possible loadouts. Maybe you'll be a light cloaked stealth guy with hacking gear. Maybe you'll be a walking behemoth with a rocket launcher on one arm and a pneumatic fist to punch people's heads off on the other. The weapons are balanced nicely and there's no 'perfect' loadout that trumps them all, it's just important to have the right one at the right time.\n\nDystopia remains to this day the only game I would unflinchingly give a 10/10. Download it. Tell your friends. Bring it back.","December 11, 2014","true","2.1"," 44 of 46 people (96%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","96","44","46","6","0"

Case in point... Pipe Smokin Yeti's made the impossible possible with this game, holding objectives for 20 minutes, single players holding and killing all or 4/5ths of the team and weakening the last few. then we go into the weapons! like most futuristic games theres always some "weird" guns but they are awesome, an Electric "flamethrower" where you can charge a plasma like ball and litterally whip it around corners and the "Smartlock" pistols that shoot a tracer round and locks the pistol to that target and with 2 guns you can hit 2 contacts at once. I could continue but its best if you just try this game before it is lost to the ages of "MODS" still cannot believe it isnt in the free to play section. Sadly this game is dying and most likely wont see the light of day again or see the thousands of players engaging in cyber combat again.\n\n","June 21, 2014","true","146.3"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","16","16","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198115503354/recommended/17580/","76561198115503354","Peter = Hell Jumper","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198115503354/","80 products in account","Tired of people spamming Half-Life mods and fan games? want something that has little to do with Half-Life other than the fact that it's running on Source? well, welcome to Dystopia! a game that isn't trying to be yet another Half-Life fan fiction!\n\nNow you may be full of rage thinking: "Peter! it's ♥♥♥♥ing Half-Life! how dare you speak words of heresy against our all mighty internet god Gaben!" guys, I love HL like everyone else, but if you are subscribed to the Source engine group on Steam look at the long ♥♥♥ list of Half-Life: 2 "mods" I'm tired of it.  It's like Halo, I'm sorta Halo'ed out ever since H4 and in my personal opinion it sucked.\n\nSo now that I am done lighting the internet on fire. What is Dystopia? it is a small free to play class based game set in a cyber punk future. You can join two factions: Punks, VS Corps  in other words the classic Red VS Blue  But this time it's a bit different. Now you can choose implants that will boost your abilities in combat or hack(deck) computer terminals on the map supporting your fellow soldiers virtually without getting messy in reality.  they call it "decking" in this game, and Starwars calls it "slicing" it's all the same thing anyway so who cares?\n\nHacking: there is a slight difference between Dystopia's hacking and other game's hacking. Hacking in games generally result in being a little mini-game  take Dead Space or Mass Effect's hacking for example  you instead enter what is called "Cyber-space" while in this instance you fly around tunnels getting from place to place looking for the enemy's security controls. If you have played System Shock: 1 it look's a lot like that minus the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ controls of SS:1. But there are two things you must worry about while in Cyber-space: the enemy team's hacker, or the enemy team all together back in Meat-space. Your body in reality is completely defenseless so make sure you have your team covering you while you hack. You should also watch out for enemy players within Cyber-space defending/attacking the objective.\n\nImplants: you're probably thinking "F2P+implants=P2W business model!" this game is 100% free. And before you ask, yes, implants are surprisingly well balanced  something other games can't seem to pull off yet this under played F2P game on Source is able to...Hmm, perhaps it's time to look at your game's balancing system eh?  When you first enter the game you will be given a step by step menu, for instance: Choose your faction, now choose your class, select your weapon of choice, now pick out which implants you want. You can select a number of implants depending on how many points you spend this can also be changed at any point within the match.\n\nClasses: there are a total of 3 very simple classes all three can be customized with implants and weapons. Starting with the Light: fast, heavy hitting, can't take ♥♥♥♥. The class makes a good medic if you installed the healing implant or a decker since he can get in and out of situations easily assuming you installed the decking implant along with stealth. As for his weapons the shotgun and the melee weapon is all you need since both of those weapons are incredibly strong  it's been debated if the melee weapons within Dystopia are "OP" since they can wipe out all three classes with few problems other than range situations\n\nMedium: the medium armored class is slow (but definitely faster than the heavy) and useful for defensive/offensive situations. In other words he's an adaptable class. Equiped with a selection of weapons such as the Grenade launcher, Assault Rifle, Scout Rifle, and that shocky...Orby thing I can't remember the name of....It's useful when dealing with heavies, that's all you need to know (don't judge me bro!)\n\nHeavy: the heavy class serves as a tank, soaking up damage for the other two classes while dishing out massive blows of destruction at the same time. It's only flaws are lack of speed and no hands  "I have no hands, yet I must fap" -DrCat 2015  the heavy cannot deck like the other two classes making him primerally a defense class. He has the option to only choose 3-4 implants (depending on what you installed) and his weapons of mass destruction are: the chaingun, the rocket launcher, the rail gun and the shotgun/grenade launcher claw of robo fapping.\n\nFinal verdict: And that's pretty much it! my only gripes with this game is: no player model customization, lack of weapons, (because there just needs to be MORE GUN!!!) and the sad limit of only a couple maps. However it's well balanced, has a nice funny community and it's just generally fun with anybody. You will of course meet some dumbass kids along the way  god knows I've been accused of somehow "aimbotting" or switching god mode on even though I die as much as they do...  My score for Dystopia is a 7/10. It could have been an 8/10 if there was UGC (User Generated Content) and the servers weren't so lifeless like they are now. But despite that it's free, it's fun, and there are still some players who play this game. It just depends on what time of day and how long you are willing to wait until people notice there is someone on a server.\n\nAnother thing I should tell you is; the dev's seem to have quit all development on Dystopia...So it's kinda dead in the water unless someone picks it up or buy's the IP (if it's even available.) If I knew more about Source engine I would love to remake this game, but one can dream am I right?","March 16, 2015","true","19.7"," 21 of 32 people (66%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","66","21","32","7","9"

I've played a lot of games like most of you so I have some reference.\n\nThis was the most fun I've ever had in a FPS, let alone game, ever. I can't even think of a game that was more fun than Dystopia beta U4-U5 or comes even close. Before steam started tracking play time, I must of had at least 500 hours in this game. I tried explaining to someone how fun this game was a few days ago but it was just lost on them.\n\nAs previous reviewers have stated there were certain elements to the game that made it so fun like sneaking into enemy base and backdoor hacking to turn the turrets on the other team. Or trying to sneak in while invisible to press first objective switch in vaccine. It was just so thrilling. This game required team work to win but was niche enough to have a great community of players who knew what they were doing since this was back in the day before mods were so streamlined though steam. Which ment that it was a 10 v 10 of players who knew each other and knew how to play the game which made for really fun games. The maps were very well designed too (I played vaccine for 6 months as the only map in the mod at the time).\n\nEven the weapons and body mods were unique and fun. The laser rifle required you to hold it down to charge it and release when you wanted to shoot which made it really balanced, Same thing with the other weapons, they were really gratifying. For a mod in 2006 that had invisiblity, thermal vision, healing, leg jumpers, etc made by a random devteam, the whole game seemed very balanced within the first 2 updates, given the amount of upgrade and weapon variations.\n\nI'm probably just rambling on in this review because I really can't pinpoint what made this game so great. There's a hundred games like it but still nothing that comes near it. Maybe it's just nostalgia about a simpler time with games but I hope not because that would mean that I will never have as much fun as I did back in 2007 playing video games. I'm downloading it now.\n\n\nI don't think so sista","April 27, 2015","true","14.1"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","8","8","0","0"

They require good team co-ordination in order to win. Especially since aspects of the objectives take place in 2 parallel worlds that affect each other in real time [Meatspace - physical world: similar to most fps with a cyperpunk theme (weapons like laser rifle, tesla rifle, ion cannon), 3 class types (v.balanced) and deus ex like implants, inc increased speed, thermal vision, medic, stealth(invisi). Cyberspace - think system shock 1 or tripping on acid: req decking implant; deckers speed thru cyberspace hacking objectives, adding security and fighting off enemy deckers in low grav/high speed combat using in essence quake railgun, lightening gun and rocket launcher.]\n\nThe game does have a high learning curve, there are game guides on the community hub: http://steamcommunity.com/app/17580    If you have questions when your in game most players will answer them, generally speaking the community is pretty friendly.\n\nIf you find that you keep going on and servers are empty recommend you join this group: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/dyspugs   Matches are organised and announced through this and sometimes when public games are going on there is also an announcement to indicate a server is populated.\n\nThis game last had a major update at the end of 2013.\n\nGet this game! its free and when balanced and people play as a team it can be extremely exhilarating far more so than most generic fps' I have played.","July 5, 2012","true","765.2"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","1"

It has a variety of weapons and abilities. Not to mention that when you're hacking devices, you don't just push buttons to capture nodes like in Deus Ex: Human Revolution, you literally enter cyber space and jump around and shoot at your enemies with energy beams until you snuff them out of cyberspace and or when you find your objective. My only problems are that there aren't alot of matches. It's just Red attacking while Blue is defending. Kind of like a reverse Team Fortress 2. Maybe if the creators added diferent types of matches, like Capture the flag or something else than just attack/defend, it would have a lot of replay value. Another thing is that some of the 3 classes are (at times) overpowered. Like if you play as the heavy, you have a grenade that, when thrown, will walk to the enemy and detonate. And at times, the classes feel useless like how certain, important abilities like hacking and healing are only available to the light and medium but not available to the heavy and you need those abilities to win the round. On the brighter side, It can be fun and can be creative most of the time. The weapons are really fun to use like the homing rocket launcher and the telsa gun and many others. Overall, It's not bad, it just needs improvement.","January 26, 2014","true","11.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I would even go as far to say it the best mod to any game, and I love both Killing Floor and Alien Swarm.\n\nThe objective based gameplay is something you just don't see enough of these days and the variation in objective design is fantastic. The 3 class system is well balanced and the weapon/implant selection is fantastically varied without having any real automatic 'I WIN' equipment.\n\nThe metaspace/cyberspace split has been well executed, with the meatspace maps being generally well laid out, and the cyber maps freedom of movement and physics application being something I've not truly witnesses elsewhere. Both realms rely one each other to either create vulnerabilities in their opponents (like hacking enemy turrets or opening new attack paths) or protecting from weakesses (shutting off poison gas or protecting the defenseless host body while someone hacks). The teamwork potential in the game is incredibly high and most of the time I find its something pubs just naturally fall into without a lot of instruction.

You see that Dystopia has a great potential of being a standalone with maybe a sequel. The only things that I wish were out would be avilibility to make maps (if you go to hammer in the game files you can make lost coast maps with Sourcetest) straight forward objectives that can help people who just started (people like me) and I also would like some kind of a guide since I did not know how cyberspace worked also a story mode. All in all it is a very decent mod that I recomend even if it has its flaws and is almost dead. It has a wonderful loving comunity a nice OST and it has a very good atmosphere that actually shows off something futuristing (unlike CoD) so my rank for this game is a 7/10 -Pixel The Skunk","November 26, 2015","true","8.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It's clearly old, the maps are dark, the sounds headache inducing, the gameplay is reminiscent of Quake and Unreal Tournament... It's from 2007 and feels like it was meant for HL1.\n\nGame is so blatanly unbalanced I was asked not to use one of the weapons because it was considered overpowered.\n\nMatches oftenly got to a point where every team was so set in their positions it wasn't possible for any of them to get a definitive edge, thus dragging the game way longer than should have been. This is because of the map design and of how respawn works in those games. If you want to see respawn done well see League of Legends and Dota 2.\n\nThe level design is often terrible. Many chokepoints will just result in a 20 minutes struggle between the two teams with no clear winner. The lighting is either too bright or too dark, most of the time creating a contrast higher than acceptable. The layouts can be quite confusing as they tend to be really open and identical corridors don't help.\n\nAs for the sound the footsteps of the heavy class is too loud, too clunky, too abrupt, etc not to give me a headache, making it impossible for me to play the class for long.\n\nGiven such major flaws I cannot recommend this game to anyone but to the most curious and to game designers because it's easier to learn from a bad game than from a good one.","May 4, 2014","false","3.1"," 3 of 16 people (19%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","19","3","16","0","0"

It was made before Orange Box engine and is only a mod, so the lag compensation can be frustrating due to the fact that the developers can't fine-tune the netcode themselves. It has a really steep learning curve, and until recently the tutorial was ineffective for teaching. It's still not perfect, but much more workable. Its graphics and environments are involving and colorful, and the backstory is really evident in everything. I love the cyberspace element, and there is actually some kind of skill in cyberspace too. Cyberbattles are unlike anything I've ever seen, and it really adds a good layer of complexity to the game. As for the normal FPS element of it, Dystopia has some very unique weapons, some of which may not be perfect but overall are quite balanced and the developers clearly care about good design in that regard.

Personaly, I kinda shelved the game after a couple rounds and never really picked it up afterward. I installed this for the sake of having more maps and props to flail around with on gmod.\n\n\nHOWEVER, I do think the game does have some very interesting sci-fi gameplay and is realy well done. I was (and still am) impressed. It even has a (rather odd, but functioning) parkour module for one of the classes. Maps are fine, most of the equipment feels ballanced- but I only know what I've dicked around with in Gmod, so my opinion isn't too reliable on the subject.\n\n\nAnd now for the one con/issue everybody talks about;\n\nCommunity.\n\nWhen I first looked at the server list I didn't know whether to burst out in laughter or continue staring. There are WAY too ♥♥♥♥ing many dedicaded servers with almost absolutely nobody on them...At all... I don't know if people are hanging out staring at the server list waiting or what the deal is.\n\n\nI say that because I joined a game with about two players already on it, then after a couple rounds the server out of nowhere exploded with players. No bots and no joke. So yea, chances are people are waiting until they see a server with more than three users on it.\n\n\nIf you're into sci-fi shooters or are no stranger to half-life then ye, feel free to check this out. If you're a Gmod user then I don't see why you wouldn't download it- even if it's for the sake of props, and if you like run n' guns like Quake- oh what the hell, I'm no professional reviewer. Just play the damn game and find out if you like it or not (because personaly, I didn't enjoy it too much).\n\n\nWether you like it or not isn't my problem. It's yours.","September 3, 2015","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

'Cause ten isn't enough. This game is great, and you should be playing it.\n\nPlease note that the learning curve is pretty steep, but it's not a high-skill curve: it's mostly a matter of getting accustomed to how everything works. However, the community is usually very helpful and will typically answer any questions you may have.\n\nThe issue is that usually there are very few players on at a time, and the playerbase is a whopping 947 players at the time of this writing.

As the playerbases of most other multiplayer Source mods dwindle, this game has managed to keep a few players more active and dedicated than even the players who're keeping Zombie Panic and NeoTokyo alive. I'd recommend installing this game just to check out the devs' rather incredible work, as well as to see just how good those last few players have gotten. Seriously - if they'd invested their time into a game such as CS, I have a feeling that they'd be doing quite well for themselves.","April 9, 2011","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
