But this game makes me wanna set my computer on fire and kill myself.  I thought I was gonna have fun and kill time with it. I got nothing but panic attacks!\nLet me put it this way. You basically have to take control of EVERY SINGLE CHORE in the restaurant! EVERY. SINGLE. CHORE! Take orders, cook, serve, do the dishes, take the trash out, set traps for rats, stop burglers, take selfies with people, go on dates. Not to mention the stress in rush hours while an inspector is watching you, so you try your best not to miss a single chore. All while cooking for impatient ungrateful ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who don't even flush the toilet, so I have to do that too!\nThis game will hurt you mentally, physically and emotionally. Because as cute and yummy as the the food will look, you will hate every single person who makes an order. Because while you finish making a fun delicious burger. You've probably missed or burned at least 4 other orders and also hurt your arm or broke a finger, from mashing every single button as fast as you can. This makes Hell's Kitchen look like a fairy land.\nBut despite all that, it's so addicting and surprisingly fun. The kind of game you will keep going back to, even for just 5 minutes to see if you can do better, which you won't!","September 3, 2015","true","13.9"," 254 of 263 people (97%) found this review helpful 138 people found this review funny","97","254","263","138","10"

And I put over 20 hours into it over a period of weeks, always coming back to it to serve another day.  You are running a restaurant, but the complexity of it severely outstrips your regular diner dash style game.  Almost every food has multiple recipes (there are something like 35 different hamburger combinations possible), and your menu has upwards of 20 items, of which you can serve 4-6 on any given day.  Manage service, janitorial requirements and a variety of other tasks.  It's hard to describe how complex and yet how engaging this game is.  It is seriously stressful, especially on the later levels, but pulling off 88 orders in a row perfectly is a rush; this is really an underrated and great game.","November 5, 2014","true","22.3"," 171 of 175 people (98%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","98","171","175","2","0"

It is both simple and hardcore X) You start with 0 star restaurant and in couple hours you know every hobo that comes to drink beer to your place at 9 am. It is incredible funny to play with your family, sitting nearby, watching your poor restaurant management. To give names to all the visitors, to invent their biography, and to comment their choices like "Omg lady it's you again and you want more ice cream?! you already ordered 3 scoops of ice cream in the morning, you won't fool anyone here by changing your clothes".\nSo you work your way to 5 stars and posh ladies, ordering wine and lobster. Both music and  art style are lovely, food is drawn yummy and appetizing, and it makes you want to cook it in real life. Side missions like dating, vip guests, robbery and hardcore catering\iron cook events gives you healthy dose of fun and competitive expirience.\nI recommend it to people who admit existence of their inner child, who understand that it is just a very cute&casual simulator, who are curious enough to read all the spam letters and food description, and who will addictively push wrong buttons while cooking the most horrible soup in the universe.","February 2, 2014","true","49.0"," 210 of 224 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","210","224","0","13"

Instead of waiting tables and clearing checks, you’re more of a line cook who owns a small restaurant in a business tower. Your main goal is to achieve what every chef wants, a five star restaurant. Each day, customers order off your customizable menu and you prep and cook their food by hitting the corresponding keys to each item, such as ‘L’ to add lettuce on a burger. This sounds relatively simple but can certainly become challenging when the clock is ticking and customers are getting impatient.\n\nAt the end of each day, you get a report of how you did. How many good/average/bad orders you did, how much you earned in tips and from orders, how many chores (such as washing dishes and taking out the trash) you did etc. This performance can have a negative or positive on what the game calls “daily buzz”. Buzz essentially controls how many customers will visit your restaurant, how patient they are and how much they’ll tip. Obviously, the higher your buzz, the better. Your buzz is affected by the food on your menu, as well as weather, time of day and equipment bought from the store. For example, foods such as fish or french fries are considered too smelly for mornings and will give you negative buzz during morning hours. However, fish is a high priced item and both fish and fries are quick and easy to prepare. For some players, this may outweigh the morning hours negative effects. While following the daily buzz is probably in the player’s best interest in terms of cash flow, you can still certainly ignore it and you would still be able to gradually upgrade your restaurant.\n\nAside from working in your restaurant, you can also complete challenges to earn some extra cash. Catering events which pit you against the clock to serve as many themed dishes as possible. In Iron Cook, a clever play on the Japanese game show Iron Chef, you must serve wave after wave of orders. The orders get more complex the more waves you complete and if you mess up three orders, you fail the challenge.\nSomewhat similarly, in Hunger Festival, a play on Hunger Games, you must complete 20-30 orders but if you mess up even one order, you fail the challenge. While these challenges don’t add too much to the gameplay, they’re still a nice break from a day of service.\n\nAs you get further in the game, you start earning silver tickets which you can use to make “silver ticket bets”. The Silver Ticket Robot challenges you to get a certain number of perfect orders in a row with the menu items s/he specifies. This gives your menu a mix-up as well as adding a little challenge to your day.\n\nAlthough gameplay doesn’t evolve much throughout the game and may become repetitive at times, there is certainly quite a few new recipes and equipment to buy while you improve your restaurant to be worthy of five stars and this can keep you playing for hours.","October 22, 2013","true","35.0"," 166 of 179 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","166","179","0","0"

If you played "Taco Joe" on Flash back in the day, this is that idea taken to the extreme and polished up. For the uninitiated: the game tasks you with keeping a busy kitchen moving by cooking customer's orders correctly, quickly, and while balancing other orders or demands of a restaurant. On top of that, you're also responsible for managing the "buzz" of your restaurant by keeping your menu fresh and balancing complex/expensive dishes with easy/cheap dishes. Complex dishes will bring in more income and potentially more customers, but also give you a greater opportunity to screw up the order.\n\nThere is a demo on the developers website if you're curious.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markallan0/recommended/247020/","markallan0","Ottyssey","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markallan0/","167 products in account","I want to start here: I love this game. The review that follows may sound critical at times but only because this is an "Icarus" game for me, i.e. it fell apart only because it got so close to the sun.\n\nI've heard some people complain that the game is too difficult, but I disagree. The difficulty felt a lot like Guitar Hero. Do you remember how you could barely keep up with songs on easy or medium the first time you played? But after trying a song on hard a few times, suddenly going back to medium felt like a cake walk? CSD is a lot like that. You can barely keep up with the small customer queue and simple orders at first, but you get used it and CSD has a wonderful, smooth difficulty curve. Eventually, you'll find yourself humming along quite nicely with an 8 person queue and all kinds of complex recipes.\n\nI really liked the mini-games that were built into the progression as well. Each of them was a nice change of pace and provided an interesting spin on the core mechanic. I also liked the way the game felt. It is very responsive and I could easily get into a rhythm on the PC version. FWIW, I much prefer the PC version to the iOS version. I was able to get into a satisfying muscle memory groove on PC and that's exactly what a wanted. A challenging game using muscle memory and twitch-based time/efficiency management.\n\nThis game is so close to being perfect that I ended up more disappointed than perhaps I should be. I still readily recommend the game but with a caveat. I've put 30 hours into the game, completed the main game progression and all side challenges, purchased every recipe, every ClicknStart project and anything else I could use money for. After completing the game and playing a little beyond that, I have not yet received the 10K customers served achievement and there is still a 15k served achievement after that. However, I have no desire to grind it out. There isn't a point other than completionist satisfaction.\n\nMy enjoyment came primarily from completing challenges and those have run out. I think this game could easily be a 10/10 for me with a couple minor additions:\n\n1) A challenge list that requires you to complete a perfect day with certain recipe combinations. The list could be huge as there are many possible combinations. Some would be very simple using the beginner recipes but some would be very challenging if you require 4 and 5 star variants of the difficult items. Perhaps this mode would only unlock after all recipes have been maxxed out for further end-game enjoyment.\n\n2) Expand on the mini-games. Similar to the above suggestion, have the gameshow mini-game force some challenging combinations and building up to harsher and harsher queuing restraints.\n\n3) Leaderboards so you can create your own challenges based on competitive spirit.\n\nThe core for all these things is already present in the game, it just needs to be fleshed out a little. The developers did an amazing job of creating a wonderful difficulty curve and establishing a solid play mechanic that's fun and rewarding. If a later patch adds some challenges to overcome, such as my suggestions, I can recommend this game without any hesitation whatsoever. It would be top of the class for the genre. As is, I can only recommend it with the caveat that it is fun for 20-30 hours and then loses its appeal.\n\nLike I said originally though, I loved the game and only criticize it because it comes so close to being truly great. But try it out! It's cheap and even with my caveat, you're still purchasing a game that provides fun a rate of less than a half cent per minute.

Your main goal is to serve as many customers as you can during the workday by pressing correct button combinations for each order. You're single worker in restaurant which means you'll serve several customers at once and doing catering jobs at the same time. Customers will not wait for you forever, if you're too late serving them or not giving them exactly what they wanted, they'll leave unsatisfied, giving your restaurant negative buzz for next day, which means - less customers. Basically, your restaurant's success depends on your speed, accuracy and multitasking skills (serving 5+ orders at the same time). There's also a "manager" part of the game (between workdays) where you organize menu list for next day, responding to mails, buying upgrades, etc. Take note that this game is not a manager simulation, success depends of your skills as a cook.\n\nThis is not a game for relaxation - it's very tense from the start, the more successful you are it will be more difficult for you in later game (more complex orders, more customers) and again, you'll feel more accomplished as the game progresses.

There is plenty of things to do (especially with Battle Kitchen expansion) but it still might feel too much repetitive for some people - this game is served best for about half an hour per session, not more.\n\nPositives:- Well-made restaurant management. It is not hard to get into the management part of the game for a new player, even though you can see plenty of options there.\n- Many cooking minigames. Coming with great live cooking management of (up to) 8 meals together. It can be stressful but this stress is coming with fun!\n- Great keyboard controls. You can control everything with hotkeys, and that will make you faster. This is huge positive surprise this game offers, don't expect poor smartphone-ported mouse controls! (For example, instead of many slow clicks, you can just remember PSMCR PSVCR PSCR for people's most favourite lasagna! :D )\n- Challenges. Have you finished the main part of the game? Come on, here you go, beat all those cooking challenges!\n- Local co-op. Yes, you can manage a restaurant with your friends!\n\n\nNeutrals:- Battle Kitchen expansion is not for new players. You get thrown all top-level upgraded meals to you to make. Don't expect to enjoy this part of the game soon (and you might not even get there, more in negatives). Still, whole battle kitchen was added for free to CSD, so we can't critize its focus on experienced CSD gamers.\n- You have to switch most of your meal offers every day for getting more customers. This is not a bad thing but it's worth noticing that the game will motivate you into trying all meals available. (Don't expect playing in style where you can just create same easy meals over and over. You'd even get really bored soon.)\n\nNegatives:- Might get really repetitive for you. If you just sit and play it for hours in one session, you notice that you are just doing still the same over and over. You must think of CSD as about a casual game with a bit of "fun stress" that will offer you many hours of playtime splitted into months of your life.\n\n\nFor more reviews, join Samurai Vader's Point of View group and follow my curator page, I'm always happy to see feedback about my reviews.","December 23, 2015","true","16.6"," 50 of 59 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","50","59","0","0"

It’s pretty simple, very easy to get into, and extremely addictive.  Little things get added as you progress (like dating, special challenge tournaments, investments, upgrades and such) but for the most part you just do the same thing from day (level) 1 to day 100.  Luckily right about when you start to get over it, you find yourself at the finish line.\n\nI was a little intimidated by it before I tried it, because it looks like it can be one of those frustrating and difficult games, where you need twitch reflexes and expert precision... but it’s actually surprisingly easy.  You do need to be fast and precise, but like: you can't even lose.  I went through some days purposely messing up every single order to see what happens, and nothing happens except for you slowing your progress to the end of the game.  That said, don't think it’s not challenging.  If you want to really conquer the game, you'll want to try to get perfect days as much as you can... and that can be quite a challenge.  Also the special challenge tournaments you need to beat for the last few sections of the game are a little challenging, but they are certainly beatable.\n\nI will be honest though, the entire aspect of the game is simply a test of your ability to perceive stimuli and coordinate multitasking of entering codes into a keyboard.  That's the whole game.  Slowly the complexity of the keyboard codes goes up, the number of things you need to multitask goes up, and little other aspects are sprinkled in to keep your mind on its metaphorical toes.  But it's fun.  And it's fresh and different.  I like puzzlers and braintwister games and I certainly hadn't experienced anything like Cook, Serve, Delicious! until I played Cook, Serve, Delicious!  If you enjoy mentally stimulating games then I think you'll like the fresh and enjoyable experience this game provides.\n\nUpdate:  With the free update of "Battle Kitchen Edition" there is now local multiplayer, weekly challenges, leaderboard contests, and some new character unlockables and customization.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","September 16, 2014","true","34.6"," 34 of 39 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","34","39","0","1"

The player has the responsibility of performing every action needed to run the restaurant (taking the orders, preparing the food, cooking, collecting the money).\nThe game can be played solely using your keyboard or gamepad, which adds to its fast nature. You will be put under a lot of stress when facing multiple customers and thus incorrectly execute seemingly simple tasks.\nFor a game that isn't supposed to be played for many hours consecutively the progression from day to day can often be neglegible leading to a lack of motivation to keep playing.\nAnyway I recommend the game due to its unique concept.","October 25, 2014","true","8.6"," 23 of 28 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","23","28","0","0"

Cook, Serve, Delicious is by far the most fun I have ever had playing a cooking game in my life. The controls are so well translated on controller that it actually mostly makes logical sense and feels like you are slapping the stuff together as fast as you can.\n\nQuickly found myself addicted as I finished the game and realized I could restart with three times the difficulty all over again, testing my reaction/speed and understanding of the ingredients placement on my controller scheme. This is for sure a controller game. I have difficulty playing this with the keyboard controls. If you have a controller you should consider getting this game. Just for the fun of playing alone it is an awesome game but in co-op cooking modes (where you switch out every few seconds) it becomes even more fun.\n\nThere is so much to unlock in this game and it is challenging even for a seasoned videogame player. I hope to see Cook, Serve, Delicious expand itself into a full blown game where you could be cooking in a multiplayer mode while friends are running the front of house/dining room and plating guests while you cook in the back while other team mates are washing up. (just a nerd dream)\n\nThis is one of the most addictive games ever.

The developer also seems to really care about the game; he posts publicly and thoughtfully about it, even apparently adding a free expansion pack to it prior to its Steam release.

It's gameplay brings out the fast keyboard gamer in you, the graphics is simple yet gorgeous that sets the mood for the gamer. While repetitive at times, the game can really be fun and enjoyable but challenging specially during rush hours. I would recommend this game to all gamers, casuals and hardcore alike. Looking forward to the game's sequel in 2016, COOK,SERVE,DELICIOUS! 2\n\n\nGameplayIt's core gameplay is fresh,fun,thrilling  and fast paced but maybe repetitive for some. There are plenty of things to do from the mini-mini games like cleaning toilets,doing the dishes, drawing out a robber's face to more challenging stuff like the Battle Kitchen update which brings out the same formula but makes it seem fresh with challenges (Not for the new players tho').I find playing this in a marathon like session (I played for 5 hours straight) to be fun but quite repetitive.There is a reward system for spending countless hours in-game from the cosmetic upgrades to your restaurant when you achieve star ratings. Food can also be upgraded bringing in new ingredients making you re-memorize all the things you've come to remember when spamming for the buttons to make the dish.As you progress into the game, recipes you've known and love become more difficult and challenging giving out variety and randomness. While the game may repetitive for some, I find playing this game a fun and rewarding.\n\n9 out of 10\n\nGraphics Before you bash the graphics for being plain and simple (Compared to AAA games like Battlefield), it does it's job really extraordinarily well. The graphics are beautifully made, while not the best, I find the artstyle to be soothing to see and the art style is just WOW. I really enjoyed the background of the outside of sherrisoda, the day and night cycle and the planes passing-by is just a beautiful sight to see. The game rewards you with a star system. The star system gives your restaurant a new look each time. 0 Stars, you would expect to see that the restaurant is in a bad condition, progressing through the game, you can see an improvement in the atmostphere and appearance of your restaurant giving out a new vibe from arriving redneck truck drivers to your VIPs, Rich and Famous. I really like the game's graphics and atmosphere.\n\n10 out of 10\n\nSoundtrack Just WOW! The game's soundtrack is beautifully made by Jonathan Geer. The soundtrack blends well with the game's atmosphere and ambiance providing you with a classy and jazz feel to your gameplay. The music is masterfully made to suit the game and for all it's worth a must buy as well (Can be purchased as DLC)\n\n10 out of 10\n\nA really fun well made game from the guys at Vertigo.\n\n\n9.5 out of 10 A must buy even if the game is not on sale!","January 2","true","55.6"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","14","17","2","0"

Cook, Serve, Delicous! is a game that's worth your money. Do you need a stress reliever game? This can be one of them if you like to take out your stress through a fast-paced game.\n\nI totally recommend this game to everyone. This is a very nice arcade game with upgrades for your food from one star to 3 stars. You can even buy equipments that will help your business. Experience a game where you don't just serve the food but you also prepare and cook it yourself. A unique feature of this game is that you also need to find the time to do your chores like flushing the toilet, throwing out the trash, washing the dishes, etc.\n\nTime management is the key. Beware of rush hour, when your buzz (the chance of customers coming to your restaurant) is high, efficiency and concentration is needed. You don't want a single customer get mad at you, would you?\n\nPros:\n+ The game is very realistic in terms of all the work present in a restaurant/food chain\n\n+ You don't just continuously play with the same food items on your menu since there are buzz conditions where serving a food for 3 straight days will lead to a menu rot (the food is not in demand anymore) stat to the food which means if you still serve it, it'll decrease the number of customers that will come to your restaurant/food chain.\n\n+ Addicting to the bone!\n\nCons:\n+ It'll take a bit of practice to get used to the key bindings since it has a lot of buttons involved for every food.\n\nNote: A new feature called the kitchen battle is still on beta where you battle other players in cooking, I guess, I haven't tried it though.","November 10, 2014","true","34.7"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

Lots of food\n\n2. Lots of upgrades for your food\n\n3. Hard, Fast & Rewarding\n\n4. Good Art\n\n5. Very Addictive\n\n7. Extra Events a.k.a Challenges that can reward you extra cash but some challenges are way harder to do\n\n8. Random E-mails (Some of them are funny)\n\n9. Good Tutorials\n\n10. You Can Date Other People Who Love Cooking (Not Actual People Just In The Game)\n\n11. Good Music\n\nCons:\n\n1. I thought the lack of multitasking was an issue for me like for example I'm cooking a burger but I notice some of my other food or chores is going to disappear if I don't interact with it so I try to click on the disappearing object while I'm cooking the burger but nothing happens (Well The only Time I'm able to click on a disappearing object while I'm cooking is if the food is ready to serve), I thought there would be multitasking with the food & chores but I guess not...\n\n2. Every time you do a correct dish for the person your dating they always take up most of your time texting which leaves a lot of angry customers because I'm busy using my cellphone instead of making food (Again this is an issue with no multitasking)\n\nOverall This game always makes me hungry & I highly recommend buying this Yummy Game.","December 12, 2013","true","19.0"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

This game is that, but much much more. +Controller Support, +Adjustable Key Bindings, +Weekly Challenges, +Food Variety, +Steam Trading Cards, +4-Player Mode +2-Player Co-op Campaign +etc.\n\nBefore your day starts you are able to choose what is on your menu, read emails, buy upgrades, and other cool secret stuff (like making bets!).  Menus must be updated every so often as food will get "stale" (boring), and customers will eat elsewhere. Also, certain foods have "properties" associated with them. Put too many greasy foods on the menu and cooking will be quick and simple, but customers will be deterred. Put too many things like "soup" and "pizza" on the menu and customers will pay more, but cooking will be difficult.\n\n"Cooking" is extremely fun. If you know your way around a keyboard the game will be a walk in the park for you; that is, if you play on normal. The game offers many different ways to challenge yourself such as Extreme mode, and Endurance mode.\n\nIf you're a money conscious person like me, the game is also sold on the Humble Store!\n\nHope you buy, and have fun playing!","November 27, 2014","true","1.5"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","0"

It is simple and easy to pick up, while at the same time taking tons of mastery to fully perfect and maximize a day.\n\nCook, Serve, Delicious starts you off with a no star, unknown diner operating within an office tower. You start off with some cash, and choose what dishes you'd like to serve. Each dish has an effect on your restaurant's appeal to customers, with certain dishes being attractive for a few days, others being staples that are always popular, while some have negative or positive effects at certain points in the day. The dishes are served up by you as the day runs by, with each dish having a different cooking process, with some dishes having several variations thanks to a multitude of ingredients. You must try your best to cook the meal to perfection while also doing it as fast as possible, while juggling multiple orders and restaurant chores as well.\n\nAs you move on, you unlock more recipes, or upgrade current recipes to add to its price, but also adding complexity to each dish. You can also upgrade your restaurants equipment to help with your day-to-day, increasing your customer's patience, decreasing the frequency of chores, and so on. You aim to complete goals to increase your restaurants rating, thereby giving you a higher-class clientele and access to cooking challenges and such.\n\nThe game displays itself in a 2D, cartoon world. It is colorful and charming, with many of the food looking quite delicious while still keeping a stylized flair to it. The game's interface is clear and concise - each dish will show you what keys to press to perform actions, and the UI is kept lean and simple, making the game very easy to play.\n\nCook, Serve, Delicious is an excellent cooking game and will draw you in with ease. Soon, you'll be finding yourself wanting to  cook faster and faster while balancing complex recipes such as soup and pasta, which is quite daunting thanks to the many ingredients in both. This game is a splendidly designed game. If I had to compare it to another game, I would say it acts like a much more cheerful version of Papers, Please in terms of gameplay - simple, but increasingly complex, yet also very satisfying.\n\nFully recommend this game.

There's nothing casual about this game. This game is SUPER HARD! And I mean that in most positive way.\nYou're in charge of a new 0 star restaurant and your mission is to reach 5 star rank.\nThere is the managing part where you buy foods and equipment necessary for your restaurant to operate and juggle them around for best buzz bonuses (% of how hip you restaurant is, how crowded it will be the next day).\nAnd then there is the action part where you serve your customers from 9AM ti 10PM. That is the SUPER HARD part (especially if you made crappy decisions during managing part and even more challenging if you're not a proficient typist) as you'll have to be super quick on your keyboard (you can play with mouse, but it's lot more efficient not to) if you want to serve most of the customers and you have to make quick decisions like which customer to serve first and read quickly what the actual order is (every food type has many variations when it comes to receipts).\nNow at this point you can probably think that this game can be frustrating, and I pleased to say that no matter how hard it is, it NEVER gets frustrating. Yeah that one order you screwed up will kill your chances of a perfect day, yeah there will be times when you don't know what buttons are you hitting from all the madness, but all this will not make you mad as tomorrow is a new day and new opportunities. :)\nThe gameplay don't get boring as every day there is something new, a new food, a new upgrade, a new situation to deal with, etc.\nAnd the developer who already put so much love and effort into this game is constantly improving it. The current version of the game is Battle Kitchen Edition, which added the multiplayer mode, lots of interesting competitive challenges and a harder difficulty (if you ask me, this game needs an Easy difficulty so that a wider audience could be approached).\n\nThe fun never ends with Cook, Serve, Delicious!","February 22, 2015","true","36.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","1"

On one hand, I'm obviously having fun if I bothered to keep playing for so long, right? Well, sure, I can't deny that. On the other hand, though, the game really seems to lack the depth and complexity that in my humble opinion, could make it one of my all-time favorites.\n\n...what exactly do I mean by that?\nUgh, well.... The main item on the menu (pun intended :P) is the method of preparing the food. Simply smack a few keys in the right order and within the time limit. In my book, that's worthy of the word "dull", not to mention "boring". While I realize it's one of the main mechanisms of the game which is meant (I suppose?) to make the game require skill, I'm sure there are better ways to implement that. Personally, I would have really preferred a simulation or a startegy based mechanism. For example - improving my cooking skills ingame by means of character progression (taking courses, learning to cook, advancing levels and ranks, hiring more cooks or other specialists, and so on). There's still room for an action-based mechanism, but the current one simply isn't good enough in my humble opinion.\n\nThis issue drives me nuts, since other than that, I really *love* this game! The concept is great - just this one major disadvantage. I do recommend this game to anyone who likes simulation games, just be prepared for the action skill requirement. Being an optimist by nature, I really hope the devs will work on a sequel, this time with the emphasis being on simulation and strategy when preparing the food, instead of just action. :)","December 25, 2013","true","17.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

It's beautiful in its simplicity and has short (10-15 minute) days which you can quickly play during a break, or when you're just bored for a while. The artstyle comes together quite well and the gameplay works out while letting you set your own difficulty - You can pick and choose what items to serve, between 3 and 6 different ones every day and can decide to get easy things, hard things, or a mix of both. In addition, the game has challenges which will allow you to test your skill at some of the foods.\nCoupled with this is a progression as you take your restaurant from 'that greasy junk joint' that people visit for lunch but not much else all the way to a 5-star restaurant selling lobsters and fine wine throughout the day. You will be offered challenges to make perfect combos, and you may get a VIP along the way asking for specific foods.\n\nSadly, the one thing I did not manage to figure out in this game are the robberies, in which you need to identify a masked man who just sort of walks past the background with 6 or so variables. How do you do this, you ask? I haven't got a clue I say. If you know a way to identify and sketch the face of someone wearing a mask that covers all their features, then you'll do fine. Otherwise, you won't be able to complete the robbery chore in this game. Luckily, the robbery is the rarest of events, so you will not see much of it either way.\nEdit: Thanks to the comment below for explaining the robbery! I didn't even think to look there\n\nThere are online challenges, and there is a multiplayer mode which I have not explored, along with several unlockable chefs which...I don't know, you don't seem to see your chef during the game so I don't really understand the point of it.\n\nEither way, it's a casual amusing game that you can spend a long time on, with simple gameplay lending to a lot of replay value","December 6, 2014","true","30.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","2"

And ample charms they are: the art is full of life, the music is groovy, the sound design provides great feedback (I love the thwack! as I lay down ingredients), and there's a surprising amount of content for what looks like a simple casual game at first glance. Even the writing is subtly clever.\n\nSo, what's typing got to do with this? It's pretty simple: I get to press lots of keys really quickly to make delicious food appear. It's extremely satisfying.\n\nIf the gameplay looks daunting, fear not; the difficulty is highly adjustable by customising your active menu. As part of progression, you'll be buying new food items and upgrading them (making them more profitable but also, in most cases, adding complexity to their preparation). But when/whether you do this is up to you. Likewise, you can set up your menu to only include easier foods, or you can give yourself a challenge by filling it with difficult ones, or anything in between. This makes the game much more accessible, and it's part of why I feel confident in recommending this game to just about any kind of gamer.","May 6, 2014","true","54.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I always heard great and many things about Cook, Serve, Delicious! back when it was mobile only and even though everytime I looked at gameplay videos and screenshot of the game I honestly thought this was not really the kind of game I'd enjoy but when it came to PC I knew I had atleast to give it a shot, and so I did. And how wrong I was, since the first couple of days I enjoyed it greatly. The game consists in upgrading your restaurant from 0 stars to 5 stars and eventually Platinum. To gain enough "prestige" to gain the next star you usually need to play 20 days, I think each day takes around 7 minutes or so to complete, and besides that you ocasioanally have to pass atleast 4 safety inspections which can be done by not failing a chore everytime the inspector visits your restaurant, such as cleaning the toilet, washing dishes, putting the garbage away and setting traps for mice. Eventually, the further you progress you'll unlock special events, first are the catering events which pay you an "X" amount for each person you successfully serve, then it's the Iron Chef (or Iron Cook) TV series in which you can only fail 2 orders and the last event is the Hunger Festivities which you cannot fail a single order and usually all the foods are fully upgraded. There's a various amount of stuff in which you can spend your money on, for example, you can upgrade or buy new foods, everytime you upgrade a food it increases the amount of money that you get by serving that food, besides that you can upgrade your restaurant by buying stuff that will help you out such as "Fun Menus" and other stuff that will increase the time that a customer waits for you to serve them their meal but you can also get items to help you on the chores. The type of food you serve on your restaurant also has an impact on your "buzz", basicly the more buzz percentage you have the more people will show up on your restaurant that day, like, fast foods will give you less buzz while healthy foods will give you more buzz and even increase the chance of getting a tip from the customers who order that food. The gameplay is pretty simple, you can use either the mouse (which I think it's a bad idea) or the keyboard to complete your orders, at first it is really slow paced but later on during rush hours it gets really hectic because you get alot of people. I find the graphicstyle to be rather good looking and charming, along with the visual upgrades that your restaurant gets everytime you gain another star and the way that the more stars you have the more "fancy people" will show up on your restaurant, you can clearly notice that by their better clothes and accessories along with the time VIPs start showing up. If there's one thing that accompanies you throughout the entire game is the main music of the game which despite listening to it for over 30 hours while I played Cook, Serve, Delicious! I still find it to be really charming and relaxing to listen to and it certainly fits the right spot everytime you play in my honest opinion. Honestly, Cook, Serve, Delicious! is a very unique game and you'll probably won't find one like it out there or atleast this well polished and well made. It's impossible to go wrong with this game, you should certainly buy it when you have the chance if it's something you think you can dig into, of course some people might not like it.","January 19, 2014","true","33.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Customers come in, you take their order, and then you just slap together what they wanted with whatever the game gave you(Pizza, burgers, icre cream, whatever). This game is if somebody took those old flash games and notched everything up to 11.\n\n"Cook, Serve, Delicous!" has a ridiculous amount of customization and choices to run your restuarant. The game is split up into individual days, and on each day you can set up to 6 menu items to serve to your customers. The foods in the game range from all sorts, from the typical pizza and burgers, to breakfast foods, to steaks and wine, to even more fanciful foods like sushi and lobsters.\n\nBut it doesn't stop there then you need to consider each upside and downside of the foods, which affect how many customers you get in a day, then there's daily chores to go along with serving your customers, then you can upgrade your foods to increase preparation options and recipes, upgrades to equipment, occasional safety inspections that decrease the time alloted for chores, catering and cooking events, and more and more and more and more!\n\nAnd this isn't even going into the Battle Kitchen option that gives even more challenges!\n\nAlso, everything in this game is made satisfying with well made sound effects as you slap on ingredients or hearing the sound of a well poured beer. The controls are very tight and well suited for each individual meal you prepare.\n\nThe mmusic however is one of the weaker points. It's well made music, but there's not many tracks in the game, you'll often hear repeats of tracks on each day, they're not very memorable either, but at worst they serve as suitable background music.\n\nAnd like I said earlier there are multiple recipes for each dish, so at times I can  take an order for "Pizza", but I don't know if they want a regular old cheese pizza, or if they want a Deluxe full vegetable pizza with ham, bacon, sausage, pepperoni,  AND pineapple. Which makes it tricky at times to juggle your tasks without dissapointing a customer or missing any chores.\n\nOverall very addicting, and very satisfying to play.","October 24, 2015","true","14.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

What happens when you have bought said equipment and mastered every single recipie (A very daunting task indeed)?

Who knew that running a restaurant could actually be challenging.\n\nThis game has lots of content, ranging from all kinds of (upgradeable) food to restaurant upgrades and challenges. It will take hours before you've earned your first star so getting that pretty fifth star might take you a long, long time. Unfortunately, despite all the upgrades and unlockables, the game becomes less interesting about six hours after you first started it. Now, it doesn't become any less challenging, it's just that the fun factor decreases because, well, all you basically do is click on ingredients. It would've been better if you could earn stars faster, or maybe earn money quicker. Either way, it quickly becomes boring.\n\nLast thing I want to say is that the graphics defiinitely fit the game; all the ingredients are nicely detailed and the restaurant upgrades make it look like you're really making progress.\n\nSo, in the end CSD is a fun game to play in short sessions. But you'll probably lose interest after an hour or 6-7.\n\n[Rating: 77/100]","October 31, 2013","true","8.9"," 13 of 21 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","13","21","0","0"

I've never been so wrong. Cook, Serve, Delicious is one of the most addictive games I've played in a long time. Every once in a long while a game comes along that just executes every single thing it set out to do, and executes those things perfectly. This is one of those games.\n\nIt's a deep game, mechanically speaking. You have access to a large number of different foods, restaurant equipment, and upgrades that can make it easier to manage your customers, prepare your food, or earn the almighty dollar (which in turn lets you buy and upgrade more food, natch). But despite this, the game has one of the softest learning curves I've ever seen, gently letting you flourish from a struggling corn dog cart jockey to a masterful soux chef and maybe even find some love along the way.\n\nThe biggest key to the success of CSD has to be it's intuitive nature. Not since Wii Sports have I played a game that has such natural feeling controls. After a few minor stumbles along the way (v for olives, n for onions) I find myself juggling prep stations with ease, pounding out orders quickly, glancing at the minimum info I need and making sure I'm not feeding anyone raw fish, unless they want it.\n\nFinally, the art and sound really seal the deal. The background music keeps things hopping and peaks and ebbs when it needs to, and the distinctive sounds for various events keep you focused on what's important. The perfect "whoof" that I heard the first time I set something on fire was particularly memorable, but the separate dings for dishes that are ready vs. prepped are  essential.\n\nIn short, this is a fantastically well put together game that has given me more hours of enjoyment than several "AAA" titles (that cost me far more, to boot) and I can think of exactly zero reasons that would make me hesitate to recommend this game to anyone. Unless of course you're some kind of fun-hating grump.","January 1, 2014","true","18.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I tried trading for it a few times, but was unsuccessful. I gave up hope of getting the game since I was saving up my money for another thing at the time, and I forgot about it. A few months later, I was delighted to find the game in Humble Bundle- I almost instantly purchased it, and I have to say, even though I got it for a dollar, I would gladly pay the full Steam price for it.\nSo far it's been incredibly fun. The concept is incredibly simple; press a letter key, and you plop an ingredient onto the dish. This quickly turns from easy to hard. You have to press the buttons with speed, memorize which ingredients go with which key, and juggle multiple tasks at the same time. The gameplay becomes even harder during Rush Hour (usually during workers' lunch breaks and at the end of the work-day), since multiple customers enter at a time. You can customize what you have on your menu each day, so you can theme your restaurant if you wanted (for example, a classic burger/fries/soda restaurant).\nOverall, it's small and simple, but turns into a huge, incredibly hard game. At the time of writing this review I only have 2-ish hours, and I'm already in love with the game. You can expect to see my played hours steadily rising.\n\nEDIT: Now I have 28 hours compared to the 2 hours at this review's writing.

This game is soooo simple in technical and visual parts but this game can give you a lot of damn good time. You may stop playing after some hour but you want to go back and continue playing because it is so simple and fun that you cannot stop playing it.\n\nThe gameplay is simple: Customer order then you serve him\her.

Oh and don't forget about the rush hours which occurs 2 times a day. Of course like in every restaurant there are some cleaning you have to do like cleaning the toilet (2 button needs to be pressed not simultaneously) or cleaning dirty plates etc... . You can create your daily menu from more than 25+ food in the game. You can buy things to extend the patience of the customers and other things. The game gets harder when you get more stars for your restaurant.\n\nIf you are really fast and like to challenge yourself in this game there is an extreme difficulty for you. It will speed up a lot of things for you. The rush hour in this mode will be really challenging for most of the people.\n\nI really recommend this game to you to get it and play with it.

I may never own or run a restaurant but this restaurant simulator is the next best thing. An absolute blast from start to finish.\n\nCook, Serve, Delicious has my highest recommendation, and also worth picking up the soundtrack.","June 24, 2015","true","26.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The extra events that are included in the game are fun and challenging, they are also handy to learn the key bindings to be more efficient in serving your food on daily basis.\n\nThe steam achievements, steam cooking challenges and leaderboards give the game a competitive aspect.\n\nIn my opninion the game is very simple but it works.

You start with a run down restaurant that needs money, a lot of money, to improve. From new equipment that opens up new recipes to improving the decor and facilities.\n\nIt starts at a relatively easy pace serving simple staple such as corn dogs and beer to a small number of customers. These customers come in slowly at first as you build up buzz about your new restaurant after all no one wants to eat at a run down place they've never heard of before. Each order requires you to give the customer exactly what they want as fast as possible, making sure they don't wait too long and you don't over/under cook their order.\n\nThis is where the difficulty comes in, each order must be prepared by pressing the responding key that matches the food type. To create something simple like a corn dog you only have to press either M for mustard or K for ketchup or if the customer has no taste both. It seems simple and it is, however this simplicity doesn't last long. As both your restaurant and equipment improve so does the difficulty. Along with the restaurant improvements comes new customers with more refined palates, they no longer want corn dogs and beer but steak, soup and fine wine. These fine foods are more complicated to make are require a good memory, fast fingers and attention to detail. So for example a customer will order lasagne that requires you to press P-S-M-C-R twice followed by P-S-M-C, one mistake or slip and the order is ruined, take more than a few seconds and orders will be missed.\n\nDays are broken up into five parts, the early part of the day will see a small number of customers then the rush hour at lunch time hits, you’ll need to be on your a-game to make it through before another lull as you prepare for the dinner rush-hour and finally after that the wind down before closing time. Deciding what dishes to put on the menu will make or break your day, too many complicated dishes will attract more people but will prove difficult to satisfy every order during rush hour, however too simple a menu and you won't attract enough people nor make enough money. Thrown into this mix are odd-jobs such as cleaning the plates, cleaning the toilet and taking out the trash, simple jobs but they are usually thrown at you when you least want or expect them and can seriously throw a spanner into what was a successful rush-hour.\n\nAt the end of each day you get to prepare for the next one, buying new equipment, reading emails, accepting challenges, laying bets on your cooking skills and creating a new menu. There's a far bit of grind as you're required to complete 20 days before you can upgrade to the next restaurant. However it's very addictive and the game makes sure you're always busy with rarely chance to stop and think as you try and achieve a day of perfect orders. There's no great depth to Cook, Serve, Delicious other than the constant actions-per-minute mechanic but that's the attraction, nailing a perfect day on extreme difficulty is an exhilarating and satisfying experience. For many people who fold under pressure, have slow fingers or a bad memory then the heat of the kitchen will prove to be too great.","December 31, 2014","true","28.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Not just one person to do everything.\n\nAs a manager I would rather not do the cleaning and pay someone to do it. Wish the game allowed you to hire staff, at least a cleaner.\n\nDislike how I have to do iron cook show challenges to get 4 stars. Don't think I can pass it. I can't do 5 fast paced rounds and not make more than 2 mistakes.\n\nThis is not a true restaurant sim as you're the only one working in a restaurant which is insane. You can't hire staff, you can't choose prices for the food.\n\nLack of realism aside I enjoy the game mostly, it's very addictive despite being stressful, frustrating and fast paced I like the challenge up to a point.\n\n6/10. doesn't get higher as the fun eventually wears off and gets too fast, stressful, no longer fun and eventually feels worse than a real job.","January 30","true","16.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deimos006/recommended/247020/","deimos006","Six","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deimos006/","203 products in account","Just finished the entire game with achievements, and despite some problems, I still recommend it.\n\n[PROS]\n- Original concept that you don't see much. Nice for working out your typing skills, multitasking skills, reading speed, and memory.\n- Nice graphics for a 2D game.\n- Lean and intuitive UI.\n- Achievements are actually doable in a lifetime.\n- Addictive.\n\n[CONS]\n- Makes you hungry.\n- Your girlfriend will think you're taking cooking lessons and have more expectations.\n- Balancing problems between various foods. Some complicated foods provide little reward. So why make them? Fish, for example, are quick and easy to make (even fully upgraded, they only have 2 recipe cards), attract customers and have a very rapid return-on-investment. So why make anything else?\n- The game quickly becomes repetitive. You come to expect more content out of improving your restaurant other than just a skin change and customers with more patience.\n- The game describes itself as hardcore but is actually very easy. Can be done completely without ever using the optional VIPs, bets and dating mechanisms.\n- It feels like the New Game Plus mode was added as a last-minute afterthought. It induces even more balancing problems and the game actually becomes even easier than before. Feels very untested.\n\n[SPECIAL NOTES ABOUT NG+]\n- Because of the constant 50% positive buzz, you'll never be in trouble of lacking customers.\n- You'll actually be trying to artificially decrease the number of customers by keeping the same fatty foods on your menu for a long time and putting alcohol on the menu (going against everything you learnt in the previous game mode).\n- By the time you get to a 2-star restaurant and because of all the customers, you should have enough money to get through the whole game.\n- After this point, you can even go through days without touching your keyboard, failing all your food orders. The only consequence will be less customers the following day, which is actually a good thing!\n\nFinally, the game has a major design oversight: by leaving cooked foods burning on the stove / grill (for example steak, chicken or fish), you can block several / all your prep stations from receiving new customers. This allows you to make the game simpler by effectively removing a number of prep stations for the day at 0 negative buzz (I'm not an expert at cooking, but steak burnt for 13 hours should not be viewed by customers as "average"...).\nIn NG+, you can use this to take a 5-minute break away from your computer or laugh at 8 idiots watching their food burn for a whole day while effectively avoiding super rush hours ("extreme difficulty" achievement :-)), robberies, chores and it gives you a free pass to safety inspections! Once you've satisfied the other items on your level-up checklist, it's a quick and easy way to go through the remaining days unaffected.","January 23","true","38.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's so engaging and complex for a cooking game! I would definitely recommend it if you're into cooking games and enjoy a challenge. The graphics are mouthwatering, and the recipes get more and more complicated as you upgrade them. You can set your own menu for your restaurant, you have to give 100 percent of hard work every second of the in-game day, to create positive buzz (popularity) from customers, and you have to invest in your restaurant in other ways except buying new equipment. It's quite realistic to a point. I won't spoil it further. The only annoying thing I've encountered is the "menu rot" thing, having to change the dishes in your menu every couple of days, I've seen other fans commenting on it. But come to think of it, it's great to get a fresh change in menu every other day, it keeps the game interesting and creative.\nI also dislike how some of the negative buzz created by some menu items doesn't seem to be very realistic. Why would anyone mind for having alcohol on the menu? I'd say, in an office building, it's a plus.\nI really love the music, it's so playful and it really keeps you engaged during rush hour, when you need to focus a lot in order to do a good job!\nThe customer animations and sounds are priceless. I like how they get more upper class too once you gain more stars for your restaurant.\nI also love how there are a lot of in-game games, like the Iron Cook Challenge (think MasterChef).\n\nThis game is such a delight, it always demands more of you, it's a game you can truly try your best to play to perfection. Kudos to the creators for creating such fun, interesting and original content. And for making it truly challenging. I've been playing cooking games for a long time but this is by far my favorite.\n\nFor such a reasonably small price, considering the amount of game content (some of it, high-end dishes, recently added) this game is definitely worth trying out! It's a bargain, and a must-have for any foodie with a gaming passion! :)","April 30","true","16.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

I was not at all prepared to be that entertained. The gameplay is really a casual game's gameplay, graphics too, it's repetitive... So I could not understand all these great ratings! Now I do!\n\nThe developers did a really good job, because its simple gameplay gets so much addictive: press corresponding keys to take a plate, put some ingredients, cook it, serve... delicious! Funny situations can turn out- distracted by all the dishes to wash, you get confused by the *ding!* of a potato in the oven... and serve a raw pizza to a very angry customer!\n\nI am not done with that game, actually far from it, it feels like I am still at the beginning, it takes time to have a perfect restaurant! And yet I know every time I have ten minutes to kill, I'll try with pleasure to play 2 or 3 days and buy this fryer or this soda dispenser I've been eyeing for weeks!\n\nI do recommend and I look forward to its sequel, such a nice little game deserves more content!\n\n","May 4","true","18.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

CSD is a restaurant sim, it is a cooking sim, it is the food simulator that we've been waiting for. The gameplay is excellent, the different modes are challening and bring new ways to play the game.

It is a game which places you under the stress of following repeated sets of instructions at a sometimes rapid pace. The setting is that of a restaurant where you, the head chef, must develop your instruction-following skills to exceptional standards.\n\nThe presentation is pretty straightforward and functional, with the art style cartoonish without sacrificing the necessary detail. The humour is quirkily offbeat and in places (primarily the food descriptions) mildly satirical. If you get gripped by addiction like I did you're likely to be annoyed by the music after awhile, although the sound effects are vital for you to be cooking at your best: difficulty can be applied by simply muting the game.\n\nAlthough the game tries to enliven the cookery grind with betting, health inspections, tournaments and a rather bland dating system, the core elements remain unchanged from start to finish. I doubt the creators could have done any better without essentially building minigames from the ground up. Regardless, this is by definition a title of limited scope.\n\nI do recommend this title, however given the aformentioned shallowness I also recommend buying it when it's on sale.","July 27, 2014","true","32.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

However if you've ever wanted the thrill of pretending you run a restarant with tasks done in the form of minigames, then there are lots of thrills to be had here.\n\nFirst off, you start out with 4 menu slots and enough cash to buy some stuff.  You can buy a grill, a fryer, an industrial stove for making soups and stuff, etc.  You also get to pick food ranging from simple to complicated, and quick to "needs lots of prep time".  Food can also be upgraded to allow you more options and more money.\n\nA typical day goes like this: you choose your menu items, you start the day and people stop in and give you orders.  It could be "I need a large water with flavor blast and no ice" or "one corn dog with nothing on it" or maybe even "3 meat patties, cheese bacon and tomato" or whatever.  As long as you don't make any mistakes and don't take too long, the customer is happy and you get some extra "buzz" from it.  Make a few mistakes and the customer walks away unsatisfied but otherwise ok (no buzz).  REALLY screw things up and he gets mad and you lose buzz.\n\nOh and while you're doing all of this, there's dishes to be done, there's trash to throw out, rat traps to reset, toilets to flush, and the occasional blog post that needs thumbing up because it could raise your buzz.\n\nThe game is relatively simple, but yet it's just challenging enough to make you feel like you accomplished something when you go a full day with no bad orders, or if you made a really good streak of perfect orders.  It takes some practice to get used to it, and sometimes adding a new item to the menu can throw you off your game, but you really have to keep changing up the menu to keep it fresh and interesting (both for you and for the customers in game).\n\nThe game is very charming with jazzy music that plays at various times of the day, for various weather conditions, and during rush hour (among other events).  The art style is kinda like a childrens book, but it doesn't detract from the game and maybe adds a little flavor to it (since the customers you get depend on how good your restaurant is).\n\nIf you dislike minigames or QTE style games, you should probably pass on CSD, but if you like trying to multitask and you don't mind the physical challenge of having to hit certain keys (sometimes in a certain order) then this is worth a look.  I've enjoyed CSD... maybe you will too?","January 3, 2014","true","5.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I saw Lethalfrag playing it on his stream, so he should get that finder's fee...\n\nIn this game, you play a restauranteur who has to keep the restaurant clean, serve customers, and garner buzz by day, then prepare the menu and upgrade the restaurant at night.\n\nDaytime is frantic, as each chore or dish you do is its own minigame, which follows a unique key combination representing the steps or recipe. If you don't go fast enough or get it perfect, your performance will suffer and your restaurant will lose "buzz", representing more and better customers the next day. Nighttime is a management simulator, where you spend the day's proceeds to upgrade your menu or equipment.\n\nThis game is strangely addictive. I'm talking about daytime. The game presents you with the steps each time you have to do a chore, but I did best when I stopped looking at the instructions and just touch typed the combos. It leads to serious flow and sense of accomplishment when you're hot, and serious soul-searching when you mess up.\n\nI don't know the consequences of most of my choices at nighttime. There are unlockables but I don't know how much they help or hurt my cause.\n\nI don't know what the difficulty curve is like or how long the love will last. But it's a great blend of two different genres. Hopefully it is not too much of a grind to get to the upper echelons.\n\nFor now it's a meaty thumbs up.

It's slightly repetitive, but there are numerous easter egg quirks throughout the game that will make you laugh out loud and stay engaged. (Tip: read the e-mails. They are all excellent.) The difficulty scaling is just right, it keeps you wanting to play more in order to unlock more recipes/items and become a master chef. Looking back, it's amazing how much better I have gotten. When I first started playing I thought there was no way I'd be able to do the 5-star restaurant since I was having some trouble..I thought I'd bitten off more than I could chew (pun intended). But now I get in the zone and am normally able to beat it with ease (I just rage whenever I don't get a perfect day. Curse you multiple soups during rush hour!) Lots of fun, constantly being updated, and it's a casual game that you can pick up whenever you're craving to play. Definitely worth the money, a great addition to anyone's game library!\n\nEDIT: Yes using a keyboard/mouse is easier to use.

You serve crap food, yet decide to call yourself a restaurant owner.

The first thing you'll hear about the game is that it is hard & hectic. At first it did appear to live up to that. After a couple of hours playing I got the hang of it & the challenge started to fade. When I got to a 1 star restaurant, the game decided to come back & destroy my happy little life. Cook, Serve, Delicious! is a very fun, challenging game.

However if you've ever wanted the thrill of pretending you run a restarant with tasks done in the form of minigames, then there are lots of thrills to be had here.\n\nFirst off, you start out with 4 menu slots and enough cash to buy some stuff.  You can buy a grill, a fryer, an industrial stove for making soups and stuff, etc.  You also get to pick food ranging from simple to complicated, and quick to "needs lots of prep time".  Food can also be upgraded to allow you more options and more money.\n\nA typical day goes like this: you choose your menu items, you start the day and people stop in and give you orders.  It could be "I need a large water with flavor blast and no ice" or "one corn dog with nothing on it" or maybe even "3 meat patties, cheese bacon and tomato" or whatever.  As long as you don't make any mistakes and don't take too long, the customer is happy and you get some extra "buzz" from it.  Make a few mistakes and the customer walks away unsatisfied but otherwise ok (no buzz).  REALLY screw things up and he gets mad and you lose buzz.\n\nOh and while you're doing all of this, there's dishes to be done, there's trash to throw out, rat traps to reset, toilets to flush, and the occasional blog post that needs thumbing up because it could raise your buzz.\n\nThe game is relatively simple, but yet it's just challenging enough to make you feel like you accomplished something when you go a full day with no bad orders, or if you made a really good streak of perfect orders.  It takes some practice to get used to it, and sometimes adding a new item to the menu can throw you off your game, but you really have to keep changing up the menu to keep it fresh and interesting (both for you and for the customers in game).\n\nThe game is very charming with jazzy music that plays at various times of the day, for various weather conditions, and during rush hour (among other events).  The art style is kinda like a childrens book, but it doesn't detract from the game and maybe adds a little flavor to it (since the customers you get depend on how good your restaurant is).\n\nIf you dislike minigames or QTE style games, you should probably pass on CSD, but if you like trying to multitask and you don't mind the physical challenge of having to hit certain keys (sometimes in a certain order) then this is worth a look.  I've enjoyed CSD... maybe you will too?","January 3, 2014","true","5.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I saw Lethalfrag playing it on his stream, so he should get that finder's fee...\n\nIn this game, you play a restauranteur who has to keep the restaurant clean, serve customers, and garner buzz by day, then prepare the menu and upgrade the restaurant at night.\n\nDaytime is frantic, as each chore or dish you do is its own minigame, which follows a unique key combination representing the steps or recipe. If you don't go fast enough or get it perfect, your performance will suffer and your restaurant will lose "buzz", representing more and better customers the next day. Nighttime is a management simulator, where you spend the day's proceeds to upgrade your menu or equipment.\n\nThis game is strangely addictive. I'm talking about daytime. The game presents you with the steps each time you have to do a chore, but I did best when I stopped looking at the instructions and just touch typed the combos. It leads to serious flow and sense of accomplishment when you're hot, and serious soul-searching when you mess up.\n\nI don't know the consequences of most of my choices at nighttime. There are unlockables but I don't know how much they help or hurt my cause.\n\nI don't know what the difficulty curve is like or how long the love will last. But it's a great blend of two different genres. Hopefully it is not too much of a grind to get to the upper echelons.\n\nFor now it's a meaty thumbs up.

Curious I went to the forums, read over a few thread & ended up watching a half hour video from Giant Bomb. I then bought the game. The first thing you'll hear about the game is that it is hard & hectic. At first it did appear to live up to that. After a couple of hours playing I got the hang of it & the challenge started to fade. When I got to a 1 star restaurant, the game decided to come back & destroy my happy little life. Cook, Serve, Delicious! is a very fun, challenging game.

It's challenging, humorous, and content wise - full. The main mode plus all the challenges will keep you occupied for many, many hours. I've owned this game on Android since its release and I can tell you that the Steam version is superior (doh!). It has the addition of local multiplayer, and weekly challenges.\n\nIn my experience, some things (recipes) in this game are easier on touch devices, and some of them are easier on a keyboard (yes, you can play with a controller, but it is waaay more difficult than playing with a keyboard).\n\nI encourage you to try this game.

I'd really like to put some more time into it, but overall accomplishments come slowly in this game.\n\nCook, Serve, Delicious! is a restaurant sim, but the focus of the game is on the individual preparation of dishes, all of which are delivered in deceptively simple minigames which you have to complete in rapid fire succession over the course of each day of running the restaurant.\n\nIt's a great concept that they can get a lot of mileage out of. There's a surprising amount of depth in this game, especially since I picked it up for just 5 dollars.\n\nThere's a high number of dishes you can buy to serve in the restaurant, as well as uprgrades to all those dishes. There's a number of upgrades you can buy for your restaurant as well. There's random events that can occur during the day, and if you want your restaurant to be successful you have to manage your menu in such a way as to maximize appeal, taking various factors into account. These factors include your own abilities at the game as well.\n\nPerhaps there's going to be a safety inspection that day, and you don't want to miss out on any chores, so you stack the menu with dishes you know you can prepare quickly and easily, so you have more opportunity to focus on things the safety inspector will pay attention to.\n\nIn addition, there's multiple modes available in the game, catering requires you to prepare a smaller number of dishes, but in faster succession and with less room for error. There's also a battle kitchen minigame, and other content that I have yet to experience because I'm only a 2 star restaurant right now.\n\nThere's competitive and co-op multiplayer as well. Including a mode that can be played with two people on the same mouse and keyboard, which is nice to see.\n\nLike I said, a surprising amount of depth.\n\nI understand a sequel is coming out soon, and I'm already excited for it.\n\nThere are however, some things that frustrate me about this game.\n\nFirst I feel like the progression is a little slow, but that's understandable, as it encourages you to hone your skills on certain dishes before moving on. It also means that this is a game you can get a lot of mileage out of.\n\nAlso, I feel like some of the upgrades on food items are unneccesary and break the flow of the game. Lasagna, for example,  was already a difficult dish because it's slow to prepare and cook. The minigame associated with it required you to press 4 buttons in a specific sequence three times. It got easier after you memorized the sequence and I eventually got better at it. With the upgrades though, lasagna orders have more ingredients, and become randomized, completely  changing the nature of the minigame associated with it, and making it much more difficult.\n\nI think there should be more options to customize the look and feel of my restaurant, and perhaps a chance to specialize in certain types of food rather than having a menu that changes every two days (I don't know of any restaurants that do this). I mean, I really enjoyed preparing the seafood items in the game and I would enjoy having an in-game restaurant that specialized in this, and showcased it through decor or something similar, but there are no options to do so.","September 18, 2015","true","14.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It sounds kind of tedious but in reality it is more precarious then anything, with managing all actions being a really tough balencing act, esspecially during rush hour.\nThe gameplay is increadibly fast-paced and hectic, although less so in the beginning so you have time to adapt to the difficulty curve.\n\nMy only gripe with the game is the system requirements, on my desktop it runs fine but there are occasional times when the game will drop frames when rush hour starts that can mess up an otherwise perfect day in game.\n\nFuture suggestions (Incase the developer takes time to read this crap)\n1. Better streamlining of the code & performance options (Idk how the game treats 4+ core cpus)\n2. Additional recipes using new equipment (Right now smoothies/milkshakes come to mind)\n3. More character models for the game (The current ones repeat slightly too much for my taste)\n\nOverall this is a fantastic game that deserves to have a much bigger following then what it currently has, with a few more updates it would not be crazy to put this game in my top 25 list of the best games I've ever played.\n\nAddendum: I am aware that the same game developer(s?) make a game with the same hectic fast switching task game called "The oil blue". Personally I just could not get the hang of this game as the admitedly very nice art style distracts from the gameplay and overall it plays much more clunky and despite being slower, is seemingly more difficult and much less fun.","January 11, 2014","true","59.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It's actually something more than typing. Owning a restaurant isn't as easy as you thought and so proves this game. You start off from a crappy restaurant in a tower, putting ketchup and mustard on corn dogs and serving burgers. But as you move on, you'll be serving soups, pastas and other top notch foods, becoming the finest restaurant to date.\n\nBut it's not just that. You must arrange your menu, depending on the weather, the people and what the VIP like (when they come), earning additional daily buzz, which means more money in a day.\n\nWith the restaurant there are also problems. You must do things like wash dishes, trap mouses (on the first steps) or flush toilets. But there are things such as the Protection Due, the -previously mentioned- VIPs and robbers.\n\nWhat makes this game addicting is the fact that it has a lot of ways to play the game. You can start by saving money for buying a new food, or for upgrading another one.

You start with some cash to make a start up resturant buisness, it's a lot of fun for any simulation lover. The game might seem boring at first, but once you get into it, it opens up more. You get to purchase loads of foods, breakfast/lunch/dinner. Later on when you ahieve 2 or so stars you get catering events, and by 3 or 4 you get to be an iron cook. More about the gameplay you use either A. Your mouse, or B. Your keyboard, such as ice cream would be "V" for 1 scoop vanilla, and 'C' would be a cherry. You can also click on the button corresponding to the ingriedent. Lastly it may seem repitive, but once you finish a day (9/10 mins), you may get an email saying, "20% more buzz today," that makes you want to do just one more day. Overall I give the game a 8/10. I would like to see more features added, though.","June 15, 2014","true","21.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You start out at a 0 star restaurant and have to slowly work your way up to a 5 star restaurant by purchasing upgrading foods, and serving customers day by day. It sounds simple and boring, but it's really fun and charming.\n\nThe gameplay is good, food is prepared and served by hitting the right key combination so that you get the requested ingredients right, you have many foods/recipes to purchase with different ways of preparing them, and as you upgrade your foods, it adds even more recipes, while allowing you to charge more. You can also buy equipment like a grill station, fryer, stove station, tip jar, table snacks. In order to increase the star rating of your restaurant, you must meet a different list of requirements each time. These sometimes include some of the "side missions" such as catering, cooking shows, etc. Seems like a casual game , but has enough depth in gameplay to keep you interested.\n\nThe art style is awesome, it feels cartoony and cute, and the music also fits,  everything just fits together to make you want to keep playing. The progression of the story is good, it becomes more difficult every day and also the controls are very quick and good, either by mouse or by keyboard.\n\nIt is a good casual cooking simulator, if you like these types of games you should give it a try, 9/10.\n","July 22, 2014","true","59.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game presents itself as it is: You run a resturaunt (Seemingly alone with no other staff), you cook food, server it, earn money, buy new foods, repeat.\n\nHowever, you have some things i myself have NEVER seen in resturant games before:\n\n-You can cater to outside sources\n-You can participate in a speical challange (Like the iron cheif in ORDER UP!)\n-You have an e-mail system where you can get e-mails which can either help or hurt you (Also junk mail is sent)\n-You can be robbed\nYou must keep up with chores (Washing dishes, taking out the trash, toilet maintenance, and setting rat traps) While also making sure you keep your customers happy\n\nNow, all this CAN seem overwhelming, and it is at first, but once you get used to it and buy some upgrades (You can upgrade multiple things to help you, as well as upgrade your shop), it becomes just paying attetion. Not to mention, it contains FULL keyboard support, so while serving customers, you don't have to touch your mouse at all if you don't want to.\n\nAll in all, Cook, Serve, Delicious! is a truly unique game that i enjoy, and many other people would enjoy as well.

You are in charge of single-handed running the busiest restaurant in the world, and are expected to prepare and serve each meal promptly and to order. This is simple with cheaper dishes such as corn dogs and fish filet; however, as the game progresses, and you are asked to prepare more complicated meals, the pace mounts exponentially. Balancing your menu not only involved making sure you don't serve the same thing too often: it also involves balancing your menu so that you don't serve too many difficult dishes at once. For those not satisfied with the normal progression, random bets and Steam challenges are here to give you the opportunity to grab extra bragging rights.\n\nHonestly, CSD is one of the best cooking games I've played, and it's definitely worth the full $10.","February 20, 2014","true","18.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/turinwing/recommended/247020/","turinwing","Perdix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/turinwing/","148 products in account","TL;DR - This is a QTE-based simulation that has as much to do about cooking as Game Dev Tycoon has to do about game development.  This can definitely be classed as a casual game, but the balance between grinding for the next 'star' for your restaurant is balanced by the new meal/equipment rewards.  The game lacks much depth, but is still very addictive and fun - I'd recommend to anyone who is after pick-up/put-down play that can be extended for hours without much additional effort.\n\nCooking is done by selecting the customer (1-9) and following through with the preset key-presses needed to cook the meal they requested ('k' for 'ketchup' etc) within the allocated time-slot; the more orders you complete perfectly, the greater your 'buzz' value, which, in turn, brings in more customers. While this system works pretty well, on recipes with a large number of potential ingredients you can end up encountering difficulties - Cabbage, Celery and Cinnamon can't ALL be bound to the letter 'C', so you can end up having some unintuitive combinations.\n\nBeyond the time-management and, essentially, typing-speed - the only other depth to the game is in the money resource-management - which can be spent on either more recipes (each with their own pros/cons based on times-of-day and clientelle) and equipment (which gives passive bonuses - eg. need to do non-earning chores [such as cleaning the loo] as often).\n\nMy biggest complaint about this game is that it feels artificially long - it takes 20 days to earn your next 'star', even if all the other criteria has been met - making it sometimes feel like a bit of a grind if the unlocks you're earning each day are not for the recipes you're hoping for.  That said, the game does a good job of feeding you rewards often enough to keep you playing, and those days that you manage to get a perfect score do feel like a real achievement.\n\nThis is not the 'war and peace' or 'charles dickens' of gaming - it's a fun throwaway game that is more fun than you're probably expecting it to be.  Definitely recommended - particularly if Game Dev Tycoon ticked some of your boxes.","August 16, 2014","true","31.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I've wasted several hours in it. It's not a simulator or a strategy game, it's completely action oriented, you make foods and serve beverages doing a series os key combos, something simillar to fighting games like Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat. Don't let the subject or the "facebook look" fool you. It's a great game, and the controls respond perfectly once you get the hang of it (it will make you life easier if you are a fast typist).

But ultimately I keep coming back to the fact that this is essentially a 'diner' game much like I've played before.\n\nSo in the end, if that's the type of game you like, then you'll like this game a lot.

And still, when you manage to do everything just fine, it feels SO satisfying! The game manages to keep that tension up most of the time, making you feel that you're just one step away from screwing up your combo -because, after all, you are-, and yet it always seems to be a manageable challenge. It's just exhilarating to get everything right!\n\nOn top of that, the atmosphere is sublime - the graphics are cute, and all the music and sounds fit together perfectly.

You get to purchase loads of foods, breakfast/lunch/dinner. Later on when you ahieve 2 or so stars you get catering events, and by 3 or 4 you get to be an iron cook. More about the gameplay you use either A. Your mouse, or B. Your keyboard, such as ice cream would be "V" for 1 scoop vanilla, and 'C' would be a cherry.

The price of improving recipes is a little steep but gives incentive to keep playing however there are some problem areas that need focus on.\n\nI encountered two problems while playing this game which has forced me to not include two food items on my menu.\n\n1) The soda order of "large cola with ice and fruit blast"\n\n2) The steak order of "everything you have, doubled, except citrus"\n\nOne of these order maybe a bug, the other is ambigious and in the course of a busy day with 60+ customers when you reach the higher levels, you can't waste time deciding exactly what the order consists of.\n\nWhenever i got these orders I fulilled them as i thought i should, large cola with ice and fruit blast but still only got a satisfactory rating from that customer.\n\nThe steak order could be intepreted as whether to include 1 citrus coating or none at all which doesn't help.\n\nShould a sequel be planned, i highly recommend having someone proof read the orders so they are as clear as possible.\n\nOther recommended improvements:\n\n- Having a back function so if you know you messed up a order, you can go back to the start of that order at the cost of time instead of continuing someone's order, knowing you got it wrong but having nothing you can do about it\n\n-When selecting your active menu, having a hover tool tip over each food that shows its modifiers instead of having to keep going to the "buy food" category to see them.\n\nThis is a good entry in the food sim category, the art is decent and actually makes me feel hungry when I'm playing this on a empty stomach with music that matches the atmosphere of the game that changes depending on rush hour and the time of day which is a nice touch.\n\nThe game is well designed with a lot of ways to earn extra money while testing your reflexes with a incentive of trying differnt food selections that you may not usually consider having on your money.","January 2, 2014","true","18.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The way the gmae does this is by allowing you to decide that’s on the days many. The foods that need more prep and cooking allow you to earn more money, but because of the complexity of the preparation and making of the dish, it becomes more difficult to manage over the rush hour periods of the day.\n\nMoreover the game even has some light management stuff going on for it: Each day you can change the menu you have to make it include less challenging foods, as well as replace menu items that have begun to rot (i.e. the foods have been on the menu for too long and customers aren’t interested in them). So with these days you might remove one complex menu item and replace it with another to keep yourself fresh in the eyes of customers.\n\nThere’s also the factor of safety insepctions, robberies as well as bets and stuff that’ll make the gameplay each day more or less hectic.\n\nNo IAP stuff\n\nI like the fact that the game doesn’t make you buy some mooncredits in order to unlock speciality foods like coffee and stuff. No, all the things and all the foods can be aquired by being really clever and good with the menu items. This makes it a fair game, and this paragraph rather poorly written.\n\nShould I play this game?\n\nIn my opinion yes. Even though it looks like a ‘casual’ game, there is a need for good finger dexterity and use of mouse if you are going to keep making wodnerful dishes and making your cutomers happy. There are NO DLC packages released, so you only pay 8.99 euros for the whole game. The game’s simple and easy to understand, and you might even get the cooking bug after playing this game!\n\nFinal grade:\n\nIf Mauve is considered to be unpleasant, and purple is the color of exhuberance, i am giving this game a STRONG BEIGE.\n\nGOTY of 2013","January 4, 2014","true","10.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You are in charge of single-handed running the busiest restaurant in the world, and are expected to prepare and serve each meal promptly and to order. This is simple with cheaper dishes such as corn dogs and fish filet; however, as the game progresses, and you are asked to prepare more complicated meals, the pace mounts exponentially. Balancing your menu not only involved making sure you don't serve the same thing too often: it also involves balancing your menu so that you don't serve too many difficult dishes at once.

The game presents itself as it is: You run a resturaunt (Seemingly alone with no other staff), you cook food, server it, earn money, buy new foods, repeat.\n\nHowever, you have some things i myself have NEVER seen in resturant games before:\n\n-You can cater to outside sources\n-You can participate in a speical challange (Like the iron cheif in ORDER UP!)\n-You have an e-mail system where you can get e-mails which can either help or hurt you (Also junk mail is sent)\n-You can be robbed\nYou must keep up with chores (Washing dishes, taking out the trash, toilet maintenance, and setting rat traps) While also making sure you keep your customers happy\n\nNow, all this CAN seem overwhelming, and it is at first, but once you get used to it and buy some upgrades (You can upgrade multiple things to help you, as well as upgrade your shop), it becomes just paying attetion. Not to mention, it contains FULL keyboard support, so while serving customers, you don't have to touch your mouse at all if you don't want to.\n\nAll in all, Cook, Serve, Delicious! is a truly unique game that i enjoy, and many other people would enjoy as well.

I've watched some videos of it, found it quite interesting and when I saw it was on sale on HumbleStore I picked it up and I most definitely do not regret it.\n\nThe core of the game is cooking. Customers will come to your establishment, they tell you what they want for food and you prepare it. You do that by pressing buttons that correspond with the ingredients the customers asked for. Say guy wants a hamburger with meat, cheese, tomatoes and pickles. To make that you press M,C,T,P. Sounds quite simple. However, there is a HUGE selection of foods and the cooking process varies drastically.\n\nSome foods require you to put ingredients in specific order, some require cooking certain ingredients individually. Meat for hamburgers must be roasted first, similar thing with meat for nachos (there are 4 types of meat for nachos and 2 types of meat for hamburgers). To make pasta, you need to cook it first and then add the other ingredients etc etc. The variety is astounding and remembering all the buttons for all the ingredients is where this game is so challenging.\n\nThe buttons are usually the first letters of the ingredients but not always because some foods have loads of ingredientes, some of which start with the same letter. Pressing O for onions when onions are actually N and O is tomatoes because T is tomato sauce (that's pizza for you in this game) is where you will be doing most mistakes in the beginning. Also you can rebind all the buttons for all the foods individually, big thumbs up for that!\n\nWhile the game can be very hard, it handles the difficulty very well. You start of with a few ingredients for each food and you can upgrade the foods (and buy new ones) with money you earn throughout the game. This will increase the price of the food but it will also usually make the food more complicated because it will give you additional ingredient(s) and more possible recipes. This way you will learn to prepare the food bit by bit, the game won't throw a lot of new stuff at you out of nowhere. There is also a practice mode for every food and you can even try to cook the food before you buy it so you know what you're getting. If you plan to finish the game though, you will need to learn pretty much all the foods anyway.\n\nAnd that's how it goes, you build your menu and work for a day. After work you spend the money on stuff you need, pick new foods for your menu (or keep the old ones) and do another day. This routine is broken up by events like catering, where you prepare foods with a certain theme (snacks, italian food, drinks etc), bets (someone can bet you can't make 30 perfect orders while having pizza and icecream on your menu, for example. If you beat it, you get extra cash) and other events, most of which will require you to have specific foods on your menu (dating and VIP).\n\nThere is also a challenge mode with online leaderboards where you compete with other people online, you can play the campaign in local co-op where one person is expediting the orders and one is preparing them.\n\nOverall, there is plenty of content in the game to keep you entertained for quite some time. Definitely pick it up if you see it on sale, but it's worth it even for a full price.","March 17, 2015","true","34.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I used an x360 controller to play. Cooking meals is somewhat like Cooking Mama, but here there's no gestures: you press a button/direction for a certain ingredient/action and almost all recipes are just inputting the right ingredients. You then cook it for a certain time and send it off before it gets burnt. A few early recipes just involve holding the down direction for a certain amount of time to fry the food, and a couple complex recipes require you to put the ingredients in a certain order. It's not too complex to learn (you start out with fewer ingredients/recipes until you upgrade the foods) but the biggest problem will be doing them fast enough so that your other orders don't suffer. I avoided upgrading certain foods to avoid the complexity. Upgraded wine can be pretty cost-effective if you don't like the complexity because it mostly requires mashing one button. Upgraded soup was my least favorite thing to do because of the sheer number of ingredients involved.\n\nCampaign mode is the big draw for me (earn upgrades, do events, read random e-mails), but there's also a nice multiplayer and challenge/score attack mode. Pretty fun if you like simulations or mastering sequences.","May 12, 2015","true","15.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In reality, it's something more like a rhythm game, especially when you get to the harder stages. You're put in charge of preparing and serving every dish and doing every chore and all of this is done by hotkeys (or controller buttons) - but watch out, 'cuz new tasks are constantly coming in and it's up to you to juggle them before the customers get impatient and leave. The better you do, the more popular your restaurant becomes and the more people come to eat there, which of course means more for you to do.\n\nThe one thing this game does well - very well, possibly better than any other game I've played - is inducing a flow state, which is to say once you get into the rhythm of handling tasks you'll be tapping away at keys like a madman and become completely oblivious to the world around you. There's no time to think, so don't: just learn the recipes off by heart and then let your instincts take over. I mean, just look at me: I play on Extreme Difficulty just because the normal difficulty is too damn slow and boring. I NEED THE RUSH. GIVE IT TO ME.\n\nIf you haven't already bought this game, please do: they're bringing out a CSD2 soon and I want it to be as fabulously spectacular as possible. Besides, don't *you* want to become so good at this game that your hands fly across the keyboard like a pair of tap-dancing spiders?

The restaurant management, the money control, the cleaning part, the kitchen part and lots of other stuff. And of course, you need to be as fast as possible to get a perfect service. This game gives you a lot of options on what you wanna cook, you make your own menu and give your restaurant your personality. Every time you level a star up the game gets harder and harder.

May after awhile the cooking gets repetitive, but you can always fix that with changing your menu and what you're gonna serve to your costumers.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lesalanos/recommended/247020/","lesalanos","Trip Hazard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lesalanos/","382 products in account","Cook, Serve, Delicious! is a fairly innocent looking game, which is very easy to pick up and play, but hard to master. As the manager of an up-and-coming restaurant (more like a greasy spoon at first), you'll purchase food, devise a menu, and quickly whip up tasty food for the many impatient and particular customers who enter through your doors.\n\nIn CSD, you'll do everything. Yes, you're the manager, and when you're not "in the restaurant", where the bulk of the game takes place, you'll have to take the meagre funds that you start with and buy equipment and food to sell, in the hopes of turning a profit. However, your job doesn't stop there. This business is your life.\n\nWhen the restaurant opens, you'll be the waiter taking the orders, the cook slaving away over the stove, and the janitor setting traps and throwing out the trash, amongst other things. How this works is extremely simple.\n\nCustomers come in, and a picture of what they want appears next to a number at the left of the screen. Let's say it's salad. Press that number and you now have to prepare the food. A bowl of greens appears in the middle, and on the right are other options tied to buttons on the keyboard, "G" for "Green and Carrots", "C" for "Cheese" etc. At the bottom of the screen it says "I want just greens and carrots", so you press G and with a tap of enter, send it out. If you don't like the keyboard, you also have the option to use the mouse and just click the icons, or even a gamepad but I can't say if that's a good way to play or not.\n\nThat took time to type out, but you'll grasp this in about 5 seconds, guaranteed. Speed and accuracy are extremely important. Speed is important because people are impatient. Once you're preparing their food, it's okay, they'll wait as long as it takes. But then other customers come in, wanting other things, so you'd better do this one quickly or they'll leave. No money for you, and even worse: you get negative buzz.\n\nBuzz is basically a measure of your popularity. It will increase if you're doing well, and decrease if you're doing badly. Not in the same day, mind you, but a poor performance one day (missed or inaccurate orders) will mean less buzz on the next day. Other factors affect it too, such as what foods are on your menu. Each type of food has positive and negative values, which you can view before you purchase them to put on your menu, or at any time after you've done that. Some foods are Fatty foods, and if you have too many on your menu, people start to have a negative idea of your restaurant and your buzz will go down by 5% or more. Some increase buzz, by being healthy, or by being considered to be "worthy". Aspirational foods, like fine wines and lobster. A good player will take a little time to balance their menu around foods which have lots of positive values but are perhaps difficult and time-consuming to make, and easy ones which are fatty foods or come served on a stick, like something you'd get at a noisy, smelly carnival for poor people UGH\n\nSo, you have a game of two halves. You have this calm, thoughtful management aspect of the game. No customers and no need to rush, just make sensible business decisions and try not to run out of cash. And then, when you click "open restaurant", you have this frantic button-mashing, so simple it could be a minigame on Newgrounds, and you're flinging food at impatient customers and cleaning up their mess as you go. Did I just serve that customer some raw chicken? ♥♥♥♥ IT MOVE ON. *wipes sweat off brow* The game actually balances the two sides very well. There is just enough meat to the management part that you can make good decisions (or bad ones) and this will affect the other side of the game, which works wonderfully because it's simple and just plain fun. You press the buttons and serve the food, and you do it FAST.\n\nThere are a couple of issues I have with the game which I fully expect to be resolved in the sequel. Firstly, you start off with a one star restaurant, which is fine, but in order to move up to two stars and start making more money, you have to do a full 20 days of service. There's no way around that, and it doesn't matter if it's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ 20 days of terrible service where your buzz is awful, or if you got a perfect day every time. Essentially this kind of "gating off" of the second star is to prevent the difficult from getting too much too fast, but it also limits your income and your choices. I feel it would work much better as a sliding scale. Do really badly, and you have to do the full 20 days. Do really well, and you'll bag that second star after just 10 days of service. I believe this 20 days of service applies for every star level, by the way.\n\nAnother thing, and it's super petty but I have to say it. You can practice making foods before you buy them, which is AMAZING. You don't have to spend $2000 on wine only to find that it's really tricky to make and means you get it wrong or do it really slowly. BUT, you also HAVE to do chores like washing the dishes and setting traps, and there's no way to practice doing these. You have to learn on the job, and this could ♥♥♥♥ you up in the heat of the moment. Doesn't seem  fair to have one but not the other.\n\nMy final complaint is that customer orders are written in prose. "I'll have a salad with ranch, cheese, greens and carrots and mushrooms and onions", or whatever. I'm a good reader and can parse this all dead quick, which you absolutely need to do, so that's okay. But what about people who struggle to read? Wouldn't it better just to have bullet points:\n\n*Cheese\n*Mushrooms\n\nLike that? None of the connectives, just what you need to know.\n\nAnyway, ♥♥♥♥ all that. This game is awesome. ♥♥♥♥, it's nearly Rush Hour, I'd better get my apron on.","July 15, 2015","true","6.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

What a fun game this turned out to be!\n\nBasically you buy "foods" (e.g. Pasta, Salad, Soup) and "equipment" (Tip Jar, Oven, Garbage Collector, Frying Pan, etc.) that allows you to make certain foods or collect other bonuses.\n\nThe way you make food is by performing a key combo. For example, a client comes in and asks for an Italian style lasagna. And for this you press: P (pasta), S (sauce), C (cheese), P (parmesan), ENTER (to start cooking)\n\nEach food has a certain cooking time. If you stop cooking sooner it'll be raw, if later it'll be burnt. So you need to watch out each food's clock in order to deliver a perfectly timed dish.\n\nAlso you have to do chores in between, some foods are served on a plate which in turn has you washing a lot more dishes than you would if you were cooking something for take out, for instance.\n\nIf you can get this for cheap like I did, make no mistake, get this ASAP","June 24, 2015","true","2.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It caught me for a lot of hours inside this restaurant ambient. In this game you're not only the one who cooks: you do literally everything. The restaurant management, the money control, the cleaning part, the kitchen part and lots of other stuff. And of course, you need to be as fast as possible to get a perfect service. This game gives you a lot of options on what you wanna cook, you make your own menu and give your restaurant your personality. Every time you level a star up the game gets harder and harder. You can count with a lot of challenges during your gameplay - that you can chose to do it or not. Full of special services, cooking games and even a co-op mode, Cook, Serve, Delicious! it's something you wanna get. May after awhile the cooking gets repetitive, but you can always fix that with changing your menu and what you're gonna serve to your costumers. It's a great simulator which makes you want to get all of the achievements and look foward to keep playing for many hours. And after beating it, it's not over. The game counts with a extra hard mode - like it wasn't already hard enough.

In reality, it's something more like a rhythm game, especially when you get to the harder stages. You're put in charge of preparing and serving every dish and doing every chore and all of this is done by hotkeys (or controller buttons) - but watch out, 'cuz new tasks are constantly coming in and it's up to you to juggle them before the customers get impatient and leave. The better you do, the more popular your restaurant becomes and the more people come to eat there, which of course means more for you to do.\n\nThe one thing this game does well - very well, possibly better than any other game I've played - is inducing a flow state, which is to say once you get into the rhythm of handling tasks you'll be tapping away at keys like a madman and become completely oblivious to the world around you. There's no time to think, so don't: just learn the recipes off by heart and then let your instincts take over. I mean, just look at me: I play on Extreme Difficulty just because the normal difficulty is too damn slow and boring. I NEED THE RUSH. GIVE IT TO ME.\n\nIf you haven't already bought this game, please do: they're bringing out a CSD2 soon and I want it to be as fabulously spectacular as possible. Besides, don't *you* want to become so good at this game that your hands fly across the keyboard like a pair of tap-dancing spiders?

Why would you do that? There’d be less money for you!\n\nThat’s right...you’ll not only cook all of the food you serve...but you’ll catch rats, throw out the garbage, wash the dishes, and even flush the toilet for the poor excuses of human beings that come through your restaurant! The good news is you take ALL THE TIPS HOME FOR YOURSELF!\n\nOn top of the mouth-watering art, and music that will make you wanna dance, this game is incredibly addictive and will leaving you wanting to finish one more day before you go to bed. It will test your reflexes and also provide numerous challenges. Just when you think you’ve mastered a food item, new recipes throw additional learning demands on you, while your customers lack the patience to put up with your ability to do things that truly only an octopus could do.\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRvilDmb8nM","March 6","true","78.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In reality, it's something more like a rhythm game, especially when you get to the harder stages. You're put in charge of preparing and serving every dish and doing every chore and all of this is done by hotkeys (or controller buttons) - but watch out, 'cuz new tasks are constantly coming in and it's up to you to juggle them before the customers get impatient and leave. The better you do, the more popular your restaurant becomes and the more people come to eat there, which of course means more for you to do.\n\nThe one thing this game does well - very well, possibly better than any other game I've played - is inducing a flow state, which is to say once you get into the rhythm of handling tasks you'll be tapping away at keys like a madman and become completely oblivious to the world around you. There's no time to think, so don't: just learn the recipes off by heart and then let your instincts take over. I mean, just look at me: I play on Extreme Difficulty just because the normal difficulty is too damn slow and boring. I NEED THE RUSH. GIVE IT TO ME.\n\nIf you haven't already bought this game, please do: they're bringing out a CSD2 soon and I want it to be as fabulously spectacular as possible. Besides, don't *you* want to become so good at this game that your hands fly across the keyboard like a pair of tap-dancing spiders? Of course you do.","February 14","true","50.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

What a fun game this turned out to be!\n\nBasically you buy "foods" (e.g. Pasta, Salad, Soup) and "equipment" (Tip Jar, Oven, Garbage Collector, Frying Pan, etc.) that allows you to make certain foods or collect other bonuses.\n\nThe way you make food is by performing a key combo. For example, a client comes in and asks for an Italian style lasagna. And for this you press: P (pasta), S (sauce), C (cheese), P (parmesan), ENTER (to start cooking)\n\nEach food has a certain cooking time. If you stop cooking sooner it'll be raw, if later it'll be burnt. So you need to watch out each food's clock in order to deliver a perfectly timed dish.\n\nAlso you have to do chores in between, some foods are served on a plate which in turn has you washing a lot more dishes than you would if you were cooking something for take out, for instance.\n\nIf you can get this for cheap like I did, make no mistake, get this ASAP","June 24, 2015","true","2.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is a combination of a line cook and a management game. It's pretty fast pace and it has multiple side challenges. You play as a line cook who also has to keep up with chores while completeing orders. It sounds overwhelming, and at first it is but eventually you adapt to the gameplay. It's smooth, the graphics fit the game right and I literally feel like this is me running a little food shop by myself. Very fun, 4 hours went by damn quick. I highly recommend, especially if you enjoy food games","December 6, 2013","true","28.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Totally a fun way to kill some time. You work as a chef in a resturant. You also flush toilets and catch rats. Why? Because you can that's why. Or you can ignore the nastiness that's going on behind the scenes, continue to serve up food and get a poorer rating at the end of the day. It works on a daily basis with upgrades for the food you serve, the restruant, the equipment etc. The sound effects are adorable, and I love the art style. My only complaint would be that I would like more artwork of the people, but it's not really a complaint seeing as this game is amazingly well done and polished. Upgrade your shop, trap all them rats because screw PETA and button mash your way to the top of the resturant. 9/10","December 16, 2014","true","3.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

What makes it different is the level of depth. Its pretty straightforward as far as the cooking part. Up to 4 people come in and ask for items, and you create it by hitting a selection of keys. IE if someone orders a corn dog, you hit the number displaying that person's request, the dog appears on screen and then you can put ketchup or mustard on it by hitting K or M or both depending on what the person wants. There are complicated items as well, like soups which require many items, chopping and cooking. That part is pretty self explanatory and theres a turorial at the beginning to explain it.\n\nIt gets really hectic though, because each person will only wait for a limited amount of time for you to start preparing their order or they go away angry. There is a "rush hour" at certain times of the day where all 4 slots fill up fast and are constantly full. I havent found a way to keep everyone happy yet, and that par of the game can get frustrating as hell.\n\nThere is keybindings to put the most used items grouped together, or however you want to do it. Thats a great feature, because the default is most of the items are listed by their first letter, but some are just random (olives are V, bowtie pasta is w) This can get annoying if much requested food's keys are across the keyboard.\n\nThe thing that makes this game different is the level of depth of your restaurant management. At the end of every day, a screen pops up where you can buy new equipment and food, check your email, look at your "buzz" (a measure of how well liked your restaurant is). You can also pick the daily menu, upgrade your food , buy things to amuse your customers so they will wait longer and so on. Each food item has boh positive and negative traits like some items are well liked at first, but need to be cycled in and out to keep them "fresh". Some smell good, some are fatty, some are healthy. There are many food items and equipment to choose from, all with different effects.\n\nThe graphics are bright and cartoony, totally fitting for the flavor of the game. The music (especially the intro song!) is peppy and upbeat, also fitting for the style of game.\n\nIf you like time management and restaurant sims, this is a great choice to consider.

There was a decent amount of difficulty to it in the beginning but it was also very fun to get into, setting up your menu and everything.\n\nThis game has now taken hold as my most-played in terms of time, though I do have to say that it sat up idle for almost 12 hours one day, so technically Just Cause 2 is the most still.\n\nI liked the idea much more than games where you run a person around a restaurant, and I thought its execution was great. The graphics and sounds are well-done. I loved the emails you get along the way. And the food and features were all pretty interesting to try out and use.\n\nThe only problem I had with the game was that it just took too long to get to the end, in that having 20 days per star was repetitive. I was fine with the extra events and all of the requirements to beat the game, but the main issue was that I would always finish all of the objectives relatively soon and the "Finish 20 days" objective would always be the last thing I had to do.\n\nFrom there, it would always be a boring repetitive run from like 10 to 20 days. I would shake up my menu and try some things, but it eventually got boring. Even though I still played the game a ton, I ended up doing it on and off as a timekiller whenever I reached the point where I needed to get to 20 days.\n\nSimilarly, I got to the end of the game with everything from the store and Silver/Platinum Stars. Then I carried over into Extreme Difficulty, but I got everything else there relatively quickly. It wasn't super easy, but it was more than manageable. Then I was stuck just finishing off 15,000 customers when I had completed everything else at 10,000 or so. Thus, I had to grind away for that.\n\nThe main way I think the game could be improved is simply to add more items to the menu (and increase the rate of food upgrades) and also maybe add a few more improvements to the restaurant.\n\nWhile the game was still fun, I have to say that it was only fun in the spurts after immediately reaching the next restaurant level and unlocking new things. Still, quite a simple and pleasing game.","December 26, 2014","true","60.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

While the game may appear to be a simple casual game in a sea of other restaurant managing sims predominantly on mobile platforms, Cook, Serve, Delicious! distinguishes itself by being extremely fast-paced as a chain of frantic Warioware-style mini-games. CSD requires plenty of concentration and muscle memory in order for players to adequately serve their customers.\n\nOne point of contention which I rarely see mentioned in reviews for this game is the potentially controversial choice of having players control an alleged murderer and cannibal throughout the course of the game. While not initially revealed, players who take care in reading all of the messages in their email inbox at the beginning of each day are able to piece together the truth to the game's story and find out about all of the people the protagonist has murdered and is trying to dispose of by processing them into delicious delicacies for the enjoyment of the customers of SherriSoda Tower. I feel that is a bit of an odd narrative choice and found it to be a bit unnecessary, but I am happy to report that this revelation did not make the food I was preparing seem any less delicious and did not detract from the enjoyment I had when I finished a hard day's work with a stable of satisfied customers.","November 29, 2013","true","2.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Firstly, I enjoyed it a lot. There was a decent amount of difficulty to it in the beginning but it was also very fun to get into, setting up your menu and everything.\n\nThis game has now taken hold as my most-played in terms of time, though I do have to say that it sat up idle for almost 12 hours one day, so technically Just Cause 2 is the most still.\n\nI liked the idea much more than games where you run a person around a restaurant, and I thought its execution was great. The graphics and sounds are well-done. I loved the emails you get along the way. And the food and features were all pretty interesting to try out and use.\n\nThe only problem I had with the game was that it just took too long to get to the end, in that having 20 days per star was repetitive. I was fine with the extra events and all of the requirements to beat the game, but the main issue was that I would always finish all of the objectives relatively soon and the "Finish 20 days" objective would always be the last thing I had to do.\n\nFrom there, it would always be a boring repetitive run from like 10 to 20 days. I would shake up my menu and try some things, but it eventually got boring. Even though I still played the game a ton, I ended up doing it on and off as a timekiller whenever I reached the point where I needed to get to 20 days.\n\nSimilarly, I got to the end of the game with everything from the store and Silver/Platinum Stars. Then I carried over into Extreme Difficulty, but I got everything else there relatively quickly. It wasn't super easy, but it was more than manageable. Then I was stuck just finishing off 15,000 customers when I had completed everything else at 10,000 or so. Thus, I had to grind away for that.\n\nThe main way I think the game could be improved is simply to add more items to the menu (and increase the rate of food upgrades) and also maybe add a few more improvements to the restaurant.\n\nWhile the game was still fun, I have to say that it was only fun in the spurts after immediately reaching the next restaurant level and unlocking new things. Still, quite a simple and pleasing game.","December 26, 2014","true","60.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/touchmybox/recommended/247020/","touchmybox","Touch My Box","http://steamcommunity.com/id/touchmybox/","767 products in account","Cook, Serve, Delicious! by Veritgo Games is a frantic simulation of living the day-to-day life of an up-and-coming sole restaurant owner and operator. While the game may appear to be a simple casual game in a sea of other restaurant managing sims predominantly on mobile platforms, Cook, Serve, Delicious! distinguishes itself by being extremely fast-paced as a chain of frantic Warioware-style mini-games. CSD requires plenty of concentration and muscle memory in order for players to adequately serve their customers.\n\nOne point of contention which I rarely see mentioned in reviews for this game is the potentially controversial choice of having players control an alleged murderer and cannibal throughout the course of the game. While not initially revealed, players who take care in reading all of the messages in their email inbox at the beginning of each day are able to piece together the truth to the game's story and find out about all of the people the protagonist has murdered and is trying to dispose of by processing them into delicious delicacies for the enjoyment of the customers of SherriSoda Tower. I feel that is a bit of an odd narrative choice and found it to be a bit unnecessary, but I am happy to report that this revelation did not make the food I was preparing seem any less delicious and did not detract from the enjoyment I had when I finished a hard day's work with a stable of satisfied customers.","November 29, 2013","true","2.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

So many little things come together to make it feel fantastic. The aesthetic design is great. The visuals are interesting and varied without being overwhelming, and the sound effects when preparing food make it so satisfying. The soundtrack is also great, and it perfectly fits the tone of the game. There's jazz, funk, samba, all sorts of styles, and all of them can be either driving or relaxing.The game is also well balanced, which may seem like a weird thing to say, but there was never one setup that I knew I could coast through the whole game with. The game makes you change up your menu and buy and upgrade your foods to make it more varied and challenging. And boy, does it get challenging. But it never punishes you for some bs reason. If you get punished, it's because you made a mistake. And since you can arrange your own menu, you only make it as difficult as you want to. Most of the time, anyways. This game is so fantastic, and I cannot praise it highly enough. It may be one of my favorite games. You may not have the same experience as I did, but I would still highly reccommend that you at least try out this game. At $10, it's a great buy.","November 8, 2014","true","48.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Most people will look at this  game and think its foolish and pointless in a sense. I actually think this game is a skill tester. I also think it could be helpful for kids. When in school, I had a special class that was literally to help me memorize where all the keys were, how to put my hands in a proper position that gave me the utmost advantage with hand cordination. It has truly helped me and this game reminds me alot of that exercise. It makes you remember certain patterns and orders and ingredients. Its also a recipe zone, so if you plan to be a cook in the future, you can get a small hint of cooking knowledge from this. I definetly recommend this to people who like challenges and are good/bad at hand-eye cordination.

If you want action and don't want to be bothered reading every little thing it shoves down your throat, look elsewhere.\n\n\n2nd Chance Review:\n\nOkay, so after giving it some thought, I decided to give this game a 2nd chance.  I felt I may have been a tad too hasty in negatively rating this game after being enraged by the bombardment of text in the tutorial.  At the time, I only had 2 achievements.  I now have all 52 achievements.\n\nThis game isn't as bad as I thought.  It provides a nice challange and provides a nice time waster.\n\n\nPros:\n\nNice music\nGreat meals  (With many recipes to keep you occupied)\nGreat challenges\nAmusing Spam E-mails (I leave the spam filter off)\n\n\nCons:\n\nCan be a tad repetitive (You can change up your menu, but after a while, you may get bored of the mechanics)\nCumbersome tutorial (Bombards you with text when you just want to jump in and figure it out for yourself.  I feel it's best to figure this one out without a tutorial)\n\n\nI know, I've had a change of heart, but I recommend this title.

It's a fun game but I would not recommend it outside of a sale. There is little to do other than the quicktime events which is basically just a keyboard mashing skill contest. Unfortunately there are no ways to actually customize your restaurant in any ways. This is NOT a restaurant sim. The only upgrades that I found were passive buffs (like needing less time to do dishes, customers waiting longer etc). It's fun for an hour or two but gets boring fast.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/techbane/recommended/247020/","techbane","Techbane","http://steamcommunity.com/id/techbane/","875 products in account","Let me contain my gushing and try to do this succinctly. CSD is a restaurant "sim" in the same sense that a bag of potato chips is food. It's quick, accessible, and makes you hungry for more. The core of the gameplay is serving a steady stream of customers via barrages of QTE's as apparently the sole existing employee, in something like Cooking Mama meets Wario Ware on crack -- especially during rush hours. Then, in your downtime between days you get to buy new foods, upgrades to existing ones, bits of equipment, and cycle your active menu to keep your "buzz" level (customer traffic) high. That's as far as the sim portion goes. The old Giant Bomb quicklook with the late great Ryan Davis sums it up well: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfXZghp5eK4 Since release, it's also gotten a slew of free new content including about a dozen new foods, controller support, local co-op and competitive modes, Iron Chef challenges, and more. The dev is pretty active and friendly with the community, and now there's even a sequel on the way.\n\nThe art is, while largely static, easy on the eyes, while the sound design complements it perfectly and really gives the game its captivating energy. The music is fitting for both the everyday activity and rush hours, and each part of an order you assemble is punctuated by various chops, whacks, slaps, and splashes. I wouldn't change a thing about it.\n\nFor as much as I love the game, though, it does get off to a frustratingly slow start. The main metric of your progress is accumulating star ratings for your restaurant, which typically require getting a handful of perfect combos, passing a few safety inspections, doing the currently available catering side events... and playing for 20 (in-game) days since your last star upgrade. You will LONG be finished the other requirements by the time this elapses, and getting to 1 and 2 stars is a bit of a drag. On the flipside, though, by the time you get to 3 stars you'll likely be wishing that span was longer, as the game starts to ramp up in challenge FAST. I would strongly recommend you be a competent touch typist if you want to play this!\n\nAll in all, highly addictive, pretty cheap, the dev's nice, and it's easily earned a spot on my favourites list.","January 14","true","18.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

You still have to manage your customers and give them exactly what you want, but the way you make the meals gives some sense of skill. When dinner rush comes along it's pretty much a frantic mess of making meals and doing chores, and by the time it's over your sweating and glad there is a lull.\n\nMy one complaint with the game is the progression seems quite slow, you will be doing the same thing for multiple days just to get to the next tier of restaurant quality. There is a few ways they change this up with inspectors, weather changes or food getting boring (which forces you to try different foods), these are a nice change, but still makes it seem like there is a grind.","November 27, 2013","true","4.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/IffiPlays/recommended/247020/","IffiPlays","Iffi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/IffiPlays/","196 products in account","Cook, Serve, Delicious is a fast-paced game, where you run your own restaurant. The gameplay is centered around cooking and serving food in segments that consist of one game day, which last for around 7 minutes. Inbetween these days you manage your menu, upgrade your restaurant and buy new, increasingly complex recipes.\nThe game's theme and aesthetics might suggest this to be an easy, casual experience. This is not true. Cooking each meal is a process requiring multiple ingredients to be added in a rapid sequence to keep the customers from waiting too long. Adding ingredients happens by pressing the releated hotkey (fully rebindable). Some of the more complicated foods require specific ingredients to be added either in an order, multiple times, or within a time limit. The game's difficulty comes from this fact, as during the rush hour, which happens twice a day, you'll really be in a hurry to fulfil the many requests by your customers. And if you don't serve them fast enough, the customers will leave with an empty stomach, lowering your hype.\nThe hype mechanic adjusts game difficulty based on your skill level - more hype leads to more customers. If you successfully serve customers, more shall arrive next day, making the game more taxing and complicated for the player. This naturally leads to more income, allowing you to advance through upgrades more quickly. And as you gain more hype and even more complicated recipes, even the fastest of keyboard users and multitaskers will find him or herself challenged during a rush hour.\nIn between days you'll be able to redesign your menu. Different foods have different perks and disadvantages. For example, pizza will increase your hype during evenings when people come in for a late dinner, but if combined with other greasy foods on the menu, will detract from hype due to health nuts turning up their noses at your fatty-filled menus. Some foods also suffer from "menu decay", which makes them lower hype if left on the menu for too many days in a row. This adds a light strategy element to the game, as you'll be balancing different foods for different occasions and days, trying to find the perfect combinations.\nCook, Serve, Delicious! also has a few side activities in form of catering for example. These missions require you to cook and serve specific dishes under strict conditions. Completing these activities grant you extra cash, but due to them requiring to own the recipes used during the mission, might end up being a drain instead of a boost for your cash.\nOverall the game offers a surprisingly difficult, yet highly statisfying piece of enterntaiment that can be enjoyed in short bursts of 10-20 minutes. The hype system cleverly balances game difficulty with your skill level, and buying and upgrading recipes makes increases complexity and challenge at a smooth rate. Definitely recommended.","December 3, 2013","true","8.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's very engaging and challenging, keeping your fingertips moving at all times. I haven't played a game with a learning curve this smooth in so long, it makes me wonder why more people haven't heard of this game. There are tons of upgrades and different types of food/equipment items to choose from that will effect how your restaurant flourish. Start from the dirt and make your way up to the fabulous 5-star extravaganza. It is a really satisfying type of experience that I can hardly put down myself. Definitely check this one out, even if you think you wouldn't like a cooking/prep game!\n\nJust to add some sprinkles to the cake; Imagine if Typing of the Dead and Wario Ware had a baby that went on to grow up and marry Cooking Mama, and then both of them had a baby. To follow, that baby grew up and went to a Culinary Arts School where (s)he succeeded better than both his grandparents and parents.

The game goes through a cycle of start a new day, serve customers, earn money, then at the end of the day you spend that money on new foods and upgrades, ready for the next day. This makes it very hard to put down, always want to move on to the next day.\nThe difficulty can be overwhelming when you start out, but you quickly learn patterns for the food and feel like a serving machine!

You work to assemble food by using keystrokes, against the clock... which in itself sounds like a pretty banal premise. But by adding menu management, food upgrades and equipment, it gives just enough of a sense of progression that addiction sets in. Just as I've spent many a night playing 4X games saying "just one more turn," this one can easily become "just one more day."

One would have to spend hours playing to get comfortable with the controls. Practice, practice, practice! The "campaign/career" is fast paced, not for "casual" gameplay.\n\nThere is a subtle "practice" section which allows you to practice preparing a variety of food. I highly suggest that you take advantage of that!\n\nThe combination of controls mixed with a faced paced game that requires a moderataly high level of dexterity, coordination, and quick thinking, makes for a pretty stressful experience.\n\nMaybe an experienced guitarist or pianist would find this game easy, but I did not. I'm not giving up, however, I will continue to play until my blood pressure goes up or I collapse from exhaustion.\n\nIf you're looking for a challenging game, this is it!","June 27, 2015","true","0.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It might look like a very simple game but believe me, it's quite hard. There are some annoyances with re-mapping keybinds (some actions can't be re-mapped at all). My tip is not to be afraid of re-mapping keys if the game gets too hard at a certain point. The music and sounds aren't the best but it's not what made me play for hours and hours on. I can't really tell what keeps me going on playing the game. Perhaps to challenge myself? It's a great casual game for people who still want a little challenge and reaction time training! You will have to work up some awesome reflexes and you might even surprise yourself how fast you can be!\n\nOh and chores. You will have to do chores. A lot of them. Do them as fast as you can so you won't fall behind in service! The key is to continue to bind keys so that you can do everything faster. Every second counts!\n\nIt's a restaurant management game and I have to mention that it's not very forgiving. It keeps you wanting/needing to strive for success and it will take a long time to master this game. You will be able to buy new food and equipment then upgrade them, you have to controll your positive and negative buzz, you'll get more and more customers the more you advance into the game. You can take bets and do different events that requires you to not mess up or you'll fail. You can even date people and stop robberies! But all of that comes with a price! Gaining money in the game is hard and purchases/upgrades are not cheap. There are a LOT of achievements to get, but don't think you'll be able to faceroll through the game to get them. You actually have to work for them.\n\nYour restaurants rank up (stars) when you've completed a number of requirements. This gives you a new restaurant, more prep stations and unlocks more food, events, upgrades and equipment.\n\nThe graphics are pretty nice, I like the visuals of the game. But as I said, the music isn't much to cheer for, I turned it off after an hour or so.\n\nWant to challenge yourself?

It's not a simulation. The only thing this simulates is how it feels to be the service industry when you're the only member of staff who still even gives a ♥♥♥♥. This game WILL beat that out of you though. By the way, you are THE only member of staff. You "manage", prep, cook and clean while hoping that your customers don't get pissy and storm out giving you a bad reputation because you took too long doing everything BY YOURSELF.\n\nBonus: You get to keep all the tips for yourself though.\n\nAs for the strategy or management  tags? This is not that kind of game. Any form of management is minimal and can even hardly qualify as being called that. For instance, setting your menu. What restaurant changes its menu every two days? Pretty ridiculous and utterly bothersome because you can't plan out a steady, money making menu to help your business grow and gain recognition.\n\nI enjoyed this game, I really did. I was hooked for almost a whole week where I'd come home from whatever I was doing that day and play it for (at most) an hour a night. Thing is, it got really boring really fast. It becomes mundane, stressful and repetitive with all of the short timed QTEs that you do for EVERYTHING. Gotta make a salad? Mash some buttons. Gotta wash some dishes? Mash some buttons. Pour a cup of coffee? Mash some buttons.\n\nThey've tried hard to add variety to this game with catering events and iron chef challenges but it's all just the same thing each time, just some buttons are pushed in different orders depending on what the customers/judge wants. Oh, and did I mention that all of these things are timed QTEs?\n\nIf you like casual indie games that you don't wanna play for too long, this is your game but I wouldn't recommend paying too much for it.\n\nIf you don't like the idea of flushing the toilets for your customers in between preparing orders, I would avoid this game like the plague.","June 12, 2015","false","9.5"," 35 of 75 people (47%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","47","35","75","9","3"

Succeeding at this game requires memorization - both muscle memory and traditional - in addition to being able to quickly read onscreen instructions and translate them into keyboard shortcuts in order to properly fill the customer orders.\n\nEach "food" or menu item, once upgraded all the way (for absurd amounts of money) individually holds the potential for dozens of "recipe" possibilities. In addition to this you maintain a menu of 6 of these items and have to be able to do any of them at any given time. This will exercise your mind and your fingers.\n\nThe game also features extra challenges, some of which are mandatory to complete story mode, that further accentuate the mental exercises presented normally in the game. Overall, you must also manage your restaurant's menu in order to generate "buzz", thus increasing your popularity and daily income.\n\nWhile it's not a hardcore restaurant simulator, it's still a good way to stay focused when you wake up on the weekend and can't think straight yet.","March 8, 2015","true","92.4"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cussbrother/recommended/247020/","cussbrother","A WINDSHIELD WIPER","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cussbrother/","861 products in account","From the sheer volume of words written about it in the Storefront I was expecting something like an updated Pizza Tycoon but instead it's basically Diner Dash, just with menu-driven QTEs instead of the maze-platforming. I guess "videogame 'journalists'" will get all tl;dr about p.much anything.\n\nHow the game actually goes: Press key to take order. Press keys to make order. Press key to serve order. Sometimes you have to take out the trash or wash dishes or flush a toilet, and you do these things by pressing keys. Rinse. Repeat. After a day is over you can buy new dishes (click dish, click purchase), buy new equipment (the only reason you'll do this is to unlock different dishes or automate some of the trash-taking dish-washing toilet-flushing), or add things to make people wait longer before exiting in a huff. You buy new equipment by clicking on it, btw. Oh but wait, that's not all, you can also plan your menus! (by clicking the foods you've bought)\n\nThe "menu-planning" is kinda simplistic (some dishes get "old" after two consecutive days, that's really the only thing preventing you from keeping a static min-maxed menu of the Highest Priced Items), and the "upgrades" are only necessary from an achievement-farming / restaurant star rating upgrade perspective, generally you have to serve 200-300 of a dish before you even recoup the initial investment. To put that in perspective, each day you can expect to sell a maximum of about 50 total dishes across all types.\n\nIt's a fun distraction and the execution is great for what it is (you can even rebind the QTE keys - major props for that) but on the other hand the "upgrade your restaurant" progression requires twenty game-days and after eight game-days it was getting a little tedious so whatever. If Indie, Casual is your thing then by all means check this out, but this isn't a fu­ckin "Simulation" by any stretch of the imagination and the "Strategy" is simplistic at best.\n\nIf it was categorized properly (Indie, Casual) I'd give it a thumbs-up, but the miscategorization/misrepresentation is pretty sleazy. If this is a strategy simulation then TF2 is a wargame.","December 29, 2013","false","3.2"," 33 of 72 people (46%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","46","33","72","0","0"

At first I like this feature, but very soon, it just became annoying to have to deal with it. Also, the further I got into it, the less new stuff that showed up, and became very repetitive.\n\nAnd that is the defing characteristic of this game that made me make this decision.

From someone who runs a restaurant, the games pricing seems a bit crazy as you spend far mor than you return your menu has to constantly change (which in the real world you will fail at the business) and for some reason you have to go to the bathroom 10 times a day (?) For cooking simulators this one doesnt quite hit the mark in any way possible.","December 26, 2013","false","7.7"," 9 of 24 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","9","24","0","0"

Many of the items have too many choices to perfectly do during rush hour, so using food items that are simply made like chicken and steak in order to complete perfect days for bonuses really limits gameplay. If you want to use complicated items, using the mouse is too difficult as it requires too many clicks. You have to memorize the order names along with all of the keyboard binds to be successful and that is tedious. Rebinding the keys of each item to the left hand would alleviate that problem, but that should've been an option from the start.\n\nMore like Click, Type, Headache!\n\n","January 21, 2014","false","16.1"," 4 of 14 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","4","14","0","1"

You have to tab to a second page for ingredients.\nThere's some ridiculous items like wine, where you have to tap like mad to open a cork, and some stupidly easy ones like the corndog where you hit one of two choices. The game suffers from a clunky interface.\n\nBeyond that, it's just about memorization and how good your typing skills are, and the layers of overcomplexity\nkill the fun.\n","June 22, 2015","false","0.3"," 4 of 14 people (29%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","29","4","14","0","1"
