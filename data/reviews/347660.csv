Breakout/arkanoid games  have always been one of my favorite  arcade genres ever since the first one was released  way back in the late 1970's.  I've played hundreds of them over the years and have some particular favorites (e.g. Acky's XP Breakout, Ricochet infinity, Arcmania 2,  Reaxxion, Hyperballoid 2, Arkanoid: The Virtual Isles, Incrediball:The Seven Sapphires, Magic Ball 3 aka Smash Ball 3,  plus several others).  All of those mentioned had something different or special about them such as a  never before seen power up,  a level editor, hidden levels, great level design or mini games, most of which   gave them  a lot of replayability.  That said Caromble has an innovative addition called leap motion, which requires you to purchase  the leap motion hardware that'll set you back  just under 90 Euro's.  I like the idea, it would go well with my Track IR, but for this game, I doubt i'll be spending a further 90 euro's.\n\nThe  level designs are  nice and I like the color scheme, which reminds me of  the  colors used in Borderland and Borderland 2.  There's nothing spectacular about the game play, in fact I found it a little tedious, though there are some nice features;  for example,\n\ni) ... A request window pops up  for  suggestions and feedback  when you close the game down  (this will probably disappear once the game comes out of  early access),\n\nii) ... Level navigation is simple\n\niii) ... You can avoid the last few  awkard to get bricks by hitting the portal at the top of the arena, that appears when there are only a few bricks left.\n\niv) ... The way you can curve the ball by slicing the ball as it hits the bat.\n\nv) ...  The end of stage bosses.\n\nvi) ...\n\nUnfortunately I don't think the overall ball  physics are good, and   the bat  seems a little sluggish.  I've been playing breakouts frequently for over  30 years  and  consider myself an experienced player,  yet I  missed   quite a few balls  in the first 10 or so minutes due to the bat sluggishness. It's nothing major and changing the sensitivity of your mouse can  sort the problem somewhat.\n\n\nSuggestions to the developer:\n\nIt would be nice if there was a count down indicator showing how long there was left of   any power-ups  captured and I'd love to see a level editor. I'd also like to be able to select or deselect power ups.  I've only ever seen this  functionality in a few breakouts  and it added a lot of replayability.  Also  some idea's for new power-ups include   ball shape changes and bat shape changes to add to the randomness of  ball flight.\n\nI will return to this review to update it once I've  added a few hours of game play and when its out of early access.  Hopefully we will see lots of updates and additions.   Overall I give this a thumbs up.\n\n\nYou can see a couple of videos of game play HERE and  HERE\n\n\n\nCheck out  Xaxtor99's review and video available HERE.  I will be updating my review   with a more positive feel to my feedback once I've played the game a little more.","August 28, 2015","true","1.9"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","19","22","0","7"

My experience so far:\n\nThis is a game that is easy to learn, but very hard to master: the levels are easy, but the challenges are hard.\nThe physicsengine in this game works very well and adds to the overall feeling of destruction. Seeing contructions tumbling down and sending the supercharged ball through it feels very satisfying.\nThe artstyle and level design give off a steampunk Borderlands-feel by having thick black edges and iron everywhere.\nSince it's still in Early Acces some options and features are not present in this build (V-sync, controller support), only basic ones like volume and resolution setting are present at the moment.\n\nThe first level alone adds interesting and new mechanics and to the classic Breakout mechanic, so I'm very excited to see what future updates bring to this game.","August 28, 2015","true","1.9"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","15","18","0","0"

The fantastic mechanics will justify your feeling while using your powerups, to destory multiply boxes, which also drops different powerups like, extra health, speed, extra ball etc. Every destroyed box will drop different points which can be, red, green, yellow etc. where each colour has it own point for your highscore.\n\nBesides that the incredible physics-based destructions, you fight your way through either with keyboard, mouse or controller to beat the evil at the final boss rounds. The game surely has a offering when we talk about challenges, since every area is designed differently.\n\nIf you enjoy a fresh brick break game, with a fast Ping Pong mechanic, then this game is for you.\n\nHere is  a demo:\nhttp://www.twitch.tv/theearlyaccess/v/13257350","August 28, 2015","true","4.5"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","1"

This game oozes with over-flowing passion from a development team that shows their devotion to making a great break-out style game!  Caromble is "their baby" and already in early access, it shows they care about delivering a fantastic and epic fun arcade style game!\n\nI look forward to seeing the final product and it's progression to that point after playing my first time!\n\nCaromble is gaming at it's most innermost raw and true core...\n\nCaromble beats the heart of it's passionate development team...\n\nCaromble is a joy to both play and watch in action!\n\nCaromble is quite simply the classic break-out style game so many gamers from the 80s and 90s loved brought into modern day gaming with both style, unique & fresh ideas, and a ton-of-fun gameplay within!\n\nGreat job Crimson Owl Studios!

But even though I can't get passed the 3rd level of the first stage Im not ragequitting this one. First off, I really like the graphics. Things are exploding and particles are flying. The fact that they build it with their own engine makes it even more awesome (I thought it was UE4). The sfx is surprisingly relaxed and layback for such a destructive game but fits in well. The gameplay could use some tweaks. As it is very punishing for dying. There are no save points in levels, only between them. This makes me stop playing after dying twice just before the end of a level. You could say it is challenging and in a way it is, but a little too much for me :). I had some hours of fun with this game for 13,- so I'd reccommend it. I'll keep a lookout for the release.","January 13","true","17.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Surprising. Fresh.\n\nThis are the 3 words that would better describe Caromble!, game that take one of the most popular and first created games  and re-create it refreshing the old school and giving it a surprising, entertaining and exciting update!\n\nYou probably have already played this concept, a bouncing ball is smashing obstacles and you have to keep it in an area without having the ball to trepass it, hitting the ball back so that it can go and smash as many things as possible. This game takes this concept and apply an extraordinary graphic with amazing effects and power ups everything packed in a way that really entertain and amaze the player.\n\nThere also are boss fights, innovatives and competitive. The level of the challenge is as perfect as possible, not too easy, not too difficult, succeeding will grant you satisfaction and the will to have a level more.\n\nThe only bad thing is that these levels end, leaving you with the need to have more and more.\nThis announced masterpiece is a must have from the Indie Scene and is worth the money it costs.\n\nThe only thing that we could ask from this game is just more power ups and maybe a mobile version which would suit every telephone and would give us the opportunity to play it everywhere, as this is what you will once you finish.\n\nVideogame News, Indie Score: 9,2 | ULTRA RECOMMENDED\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGHdDp7M_hI","August 28, 2015","true","1.8"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","1"
