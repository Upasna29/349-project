The game environment is barren and grainy, the cutscenes are skippy, and the camera moves choppily all around. If this were an N64 game, it'd seem just fine for a story-focused sci-fi FPS which reminded me of Metroid. But by today's standards, it's in a beta version at best. I understand the developers put a lot of work into this and I've normally got a soft spot for projects of passion made by a small team, but this just feels unfinished.","May 19","false","4.9"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","7","11","0","0"

I do not recommend getting this game.","June 3","false","0.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The player wakes up in a strange facility with no memories and is searching for a way out. The whole game has little outdated graphics but good voice-acting and music. The story is good and there are a few ingame-cinematics. Gameplay is fluid and the shooting is fun. Controls are ok, but maybe you need to change keybindings in an ini file. All in all, i like it very much and had a lot of fun in my playthough. Playtime is arounf 2 hours. For that cheap price, i recommend it.\n\n\nPros:\n\nFun to play\nStory\nVoice-acting\nMusic\nPrice\n\n\nCons:\n\nOutdated graphics\nNo options-menu\n\n\nHere a few minutes of ingame-footage:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZDhAR3DxLc","May 17","true","4.2"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","3","9","0","0"
