Yes.\nIs it too hard? No.\nEven for somebody who's never played a roguelike before? Totally do-able.\nYou will die. A lot. The game is designed to be hard, but not tear-your-hair-out frustrating. The way that it manages to be very difficult and yet wholly enjoyable despite death after death is a masterpiece of gaming.\n\n**INTRIGUE**\nThere is deep political simulation, effecting every last mob in the game. Gain enough reputation with certain types of creatures or people (arachnids, farmers, tortoises) and they will rush to your aid in battle. Lose enough, and they'll attack you on sight. The landmarks in the game--like the starting village, Joppa--are always the same, but the wilderness and caves are procedurally-generated. That means that as you try to reach the deepest depths of, say, Red Rock, you could find the next staircase down mere feet away or on the other side of the map. What's more, there are very in-depth and extremely interesting crafting and trade systems that you can master in time.\n\n**COMBAT**\nDeceptively simple. Like any proper roguelike, you have to come up with creative ways to deal with certain situations. Choosing whether to shoot your rifle or swing your sword could be a life or death decision. It's easy to learn, hard to master.\n\n**CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATION**\nOh, boy. Wanna be a beguilin', time-dilatin', flame-throwin', photosynthesizin', gunslingin' cowboy-snake called Grassy Jones? You got it.\nWant to be one of just a few remaining true men, an aristocrat as well versed in ways of the trigger as he is in the way of the blade? You got it.\nWanna get a few more points to put into useful mutations by taking a debuff that puts an evil twin somewhere in the world, an exact clone of your character who may one day find you and kill you? Yep. You can do that too.\n\n**LORE**\nJust play it, man. It's awesome.\n\n**CONS**\nSometimes, you get attached to your beguilin', time-dilatin', flame-throwin', photosynthesizin', gunslingin' cowboy-snake called Grassy Jones. While after he dies you can click 'replay most recent character' on the new game screen and get Grassy Jones back, you won't get his successes back. Half the time, that's fine and it's just as fun to do it all over again. There's actually a disable permadeath button, but for now it doesn't work. There are other little cons, but they're too small to mention.\n\n**THE BEST PART**\nIt ain't even finished yet, cowboy.","August 6, 2015","true","35.3"," 52 of 53 people (98%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","98","52","53","11","1"

However, it is not quite ready for a consumer audience and is quirky enough that it would turn a lot of people off.  I'm writing this "negative" review so that you can understand its shortcomings before buying it.\n\nCaves of Qud is actively in development, with all that entails.  By "development" I do not mean "polish".  There are almost daily updates which sometimes break old savegames.  Mob combat AI is still getting major improvements, items are still being added, large balance changes are made regularly.  The main quest is not finished, some major locations (the kind you can see from the world map) are not finished, and some of the few named unique NPCs have no dialogue.\n\nThis is a true early access game, not a beta.  If you are passionate about roguelikes and/or science fiction to the extent that you'd like to help develop the game by finding bugs through hilarious death, you might want in on this.\n\nBeyond its incomplete status, this game is a roguelike.  By genre convention it lacks a great many of the conveniences most gamers are accustomed to.  Input is keyboard-only.  The default keybinds for laptop are both horrible and incomprehensible.  Permadeath is on by default and the disable-permadeath option is somewhat cryptically hidden.  Many enemies can and will destroy you even in starter zones and a "fair fight" is a myth.  You will not always get warnings when steering your character towards certain death.  You will have absurd runs of bad luck that are not your fault and you will die of them.  CoQ makes excellent use of its tile art system, but it's not what most modern gamers will expect.\n\nIf you are not comfortable reading books at least a chapter at a time, you will probably not be comfortable playing.  If you cannot occasionally relinquish control and adapt to chance circumstances, you will find this game infuriating.  If you cannot sometimes let go of a good thing, this game might break your heart when your character dies.\n\nThis game, overall, has a high barrier to entry.  If you overcome it, though, the world beyond is rich and lovely, as a hundred other reviews will attest.\n\nCaves of Qud is a lovely roguelike with beautiful tile art, a piece of far-future fiction that sci fi fans will immensely enjoy.","August 29, 2015","false","113.8"," 141 of 189 people (75%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","75","141","189","9","1"

Even the best hunters in Kyakukya would talk about them as merciless killing machines.\n\nThe thing looked as mean as they said. Rows of jagged teeth flashed between frantic snapping as it splashed about. I watched from the banks of the river a few feet away, peering down my carbine's scope to get a closer look. It was ugly.\n\nI pulled the trigger; the madpole tried to flee, but another pull and the water turned red around its corpse. Three more madpoles swam over. I shot another and they scattered. I emptied my carbine, reloaded, and saw that only one was still moving.\n\nFeeling sporting, I shouldered my rifle and drew my daggers. I waded into the river and charged the last madpole, landing both blades in either side.\n\nYou can imagine my surprise when this madpole ignored the blades I planted, latched onto my shell, and I could feel its teeth through my carapace. The very same carapace had, just last moon, merely sizzled as laser fire hit me.\n\nEven more surprising was watching my right arm come off in the madpole's mouth, then fall into the water as the madpole took another attempt at ripping my shell from my body.\n\nI stabbed as hard as I could with my remaining arm to try to dislodge the madpole. This worked, in a way; the madpole released in order to gnaw at my feet, shearing them off with such speed that my terror obscured my pain. My remaining forearm was taken off at the elbow.\n\nRolling myself onto the bank of the river, the madpole released me to fall back into the water lest he suffocate on land. I rummaged through my now thoroughly-bloody pack with a stump and my face; I found it: My last shot of Ubernostrum.\n\nHeld in my teeth, I shot my bicep-stump full of superdrugs and watched as my arm sprouted back, as painfully as it did quickly.\n\nI dug out my revolver, shot the remaining madpole to death, and collapsed. I decided to wait and wash my bag as I waited for my natural mutant regeneration to generate bones and sinew to regrow my limbs, and to reseal my carapace where the madpole had bitten through.\n\nI dined on my severed feet while I waited.","August 24, 2015","true","104.2"," 57 of 64 people (89%) found this review helpful 28 people found this review funny","89","57","64","28","0"

Yet nobody knows about it!! I'm so glad it's on Steam now, maybe finally justice will be done.\n\nIf you enjoy Roguelikes or even just turn-based RPGs, PLAY THIS GAME! Don't wait for Early Access to end: Qud is already massive to the point of intimidation.

It's tough, unforgiving, but there's a lot of depth that will keep you coming back for more and don't let the early access banner fool you: this game has been in development for a long time and is totally playable, with tens of hours of gameplay thanks to the in depth character building systems and epic quest arc. The time played on Steam for me pales to the amount of time I've spent playing the old ASCII graphics version from years ago.\n\nYou have the choice of playing a mutant or a "true man", true men have a better time early on but mutant play is where the game really shines, there are a load of different mutations that can completely change how you approach the game. Want to fly over your enemies setting them on fire? Want to spawn multiple copies of yourself and shoot the crap out of something with mind lasers? Want to play a characterr with four arms and legs, each arm wielding a different weapon? Want to play a human beetle with horns and a carapace? You can do all this and more.\n\nThe world is rich and interesting too, you have an open world that you're free to explore as you wish (if you can survive), and there are distinct cultures and lore attached to the different places you'll travel to. The lore is so unique, the world being set in a post-apocalyptic age with the remnants of so many societies all layered on top of each other. It's a far cry from the generic mediaeval/fantasy setting you usually get with Rogue-likes.\n\nIf you've never played a traditional Rogue-like, the game might seem daunting at first, I know I butted my head against it for quite a wehile before I managed to get anywhere, but if you keep at it you'll find yourself rewarded with a very unique gaming experience.","July 15, 2015","true","24.1"," 41 of 48 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","41","48","0","0"

There's tons of lore to uncover and random things to discover.  You'll die a lot.  But then you get to make a new character again!  Characters can have way more variation than "Ughh.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aroguelikeme/recommended/333640/","aroguelikeme","watercolorheart","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aroguelikeme/","313 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAn absolutely fascinating post-apocalyptic murder simulator, with you either the lucky murderer/murderess or as the unlucky victim.\n\nThis game has some ups-and-downs that will always come with random generation, things like if you see white ruin walls, don't go there until either you've leveled up your mutations more or found some kickbutt armor and weapons because they can have things like psychic mutants that explode your head as soon as you get close enough, rifle turret machines, albino apes and other nasties.\n\nThe greatest thing about this game is the flexibility of its combat system, though slightly hampered by targeting and control of your mind-controlled allies. I'm about 50 characters in and I still find some new wrinkle or interesting ability/mutation I haven't tried before yet in combination. I still have yet to reach the very edges of the map or, indeed, the second main dungeon the questline but I've experienced a goodly portion of the main game, enough to evaluate it for a review. Of course, there's always the chance that by the time this gets read the game has changed.\n\nOne of the thing you might overlook is the defects: Don't! Almost all of them are entertaining and guaranteed to make a playthrough more interesting. Variety is the spice of life. My last character took the defect Packrat where you have to carry almost all of your carrying capacity or take damage and you have to wait 10 turns if you want to get rid of something, so basically every RPG hoarder ever except with an ingame mechanic. Taking the defect let me take a 4-point mutant skill (I picked a Paralyzing Stinger on my back) just as an example of how it can make your game interesting and different.\n\nIf the game ever gets so difficult it's completely unfun for you, turning off Permadeath is only a click away in the Options menu. Doing so invites a friendly "Did you mean to die?" menu.\n\nThe game is rich and textured though not every game will reveal its secrets only in the first hours: it's only after you've really begun to sink your teeth into the quests, find a mysterious man frozen in glass in a dungeon, find yourself reloading your shotgun to blast off another accursed thatch of qudzu (which has the ability to rust your gear off) out of the way, beguile an eyeless crab to join you that you might realize you're having a lot of fun... Watch out for those\nslumberlings and rifle turrets and fire ants! Pressing "L" whenever you see a new creature is always recommended.\n\nSound: There's no sound as of yet, I recommend using  the Steam Music Player for now. The Crypt of the Necrodancer soundtrack or Heroine's Quest are good for putting on in the background.\n\nGraphics: With a baked-in CRT scanlines interface, the tileset is nicely stylized. After a while, they won't seem so strange after you figure out what you're looking at. They're not top-of-the-line (That would probably go to Cogmind) but they're\nserviceable and a step above the original cluttered ASCII of the free version.\n\nGameplay: Incredibly deep! No two games, even with the same character build will play the same and there's just so many different kinds of ways to play ... which is good because until you turn off permadeath, you'll probably be trying out lots of things.\n\nWriting: The writing is very, erm, unique, sometimes a little trippy/out there with the descriptions but its very descriptive. You won't feel like you're reading a book but there's enough of it that it feels like a dungeon master's lovingly crafted attention to detail of a world they love to write for.\n\nIt's hard not to recommend this game, it can really only improve from here.

Villages are really rare, making the game feel a little empty sometimes.","July 25, 2015","true","74.6"," 26 of 26 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","26","26","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Eboreg2/recommended/333640/","Eboreg2","Eboreg","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Eboreg2/","72 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI've often heard that when making a game with retro graphics, one must allow the graphics to fit and even enhance the gameplay. I've actually played a few old-school roguelikes before going to Caves of Qud and in all of them, I felt that a graphical update would improve the gameplay, but Caves of Qud is the first ASCII-roguelike I've ever played where I felt that the graphics did not need an update.\n\nThe reason for this is that it shares a huge similarity with older roguelikes in that much of the equipment needs to be identified before you know what it is, but there is a major difference in that when said equipment actually is identified, it immediately becomes apparent that any graphical representation whatsoever would have made it obvious what said object really is to the player. For example, the carbine, a very powerful mid-game rifle. Before identification, the description says, "A strange artifact" but afterwards, it says "A composite carbine with a banana-shaped magazine." If anyone here can make a Fallout game where the average joe could not understand what an assault rifle is without giving the player an unfair and/or non-immersive advantage in identifying it, I would love to see it.\n\nThere's also the fact that the lack of linearity and graphical fidelity, and yes, I did just say graphical fidelity, gives you more freedom and better immersion as well as lowering frustation. Very, very few ASCII roguelikes actually have blood splattering on the ground and on many occasions, death can really just creep up on you for no reason. In fact, these graphics hold a special place in my heart for actually being very unnerving in one specific instance, WITH NUMBERS AND LETTERS!!! There's also a major advantage in that if you run into an enemy that you can't fight, you not only get a clear indication of that, you also get options. There are actually other places to grind for XP, which can not be said of most other roguelikes and if a really dangerous enemy won't let up, there are numerous escape options. There is no telling how many times Warden Indrix has saved my characters' life.\n\nAnother major difference is how character-building is based less on power-gaming and more on building a character that suits you. Character building for True Men is bog standard but the system really comes alive with mutants. There are various Mental Mutations that give you a great sense of power and Physical Mutations that make your character more likely to end up on DeviantArt. I wish I were kidding, it takes only one mutation point to make your character a f***ing furry. Given that I main as a character with Heightened Hearing, Night Vision, Thick Fur, and has four arms, four legs, and two heads (as well as being amphibious), seeing him as some kind of froggy cattaur with double arms and heads would only be natural.\n\nLastly, identifying objects is based a lot more on skill and a lot less on luck. On many of the older ASCII roguelikes, dying without knowing what half of your equipment does is just part of the experience and there are many occasions where you can find out that your unidentified equipment could have saved your life. In CoQ however, there is no equipment that is necessary for straightforward identification and no need for sneaksy little tricks for said identification that often left me with 2 dozen tabs open in Firefox just to not be lost. I can not stress the importance of the "Examine" feature enough, it separates this game from all of its peers. Even then, it's not overpowered, you can't "Examine" equipment in merchants' inventories and without the right skillset, "Examine"ing something stands a good chance of breaking it. This can lead to some moments where you really have to gamble on getting something powerful or practically useless to you.\n\nFinal Verdict: 10/10 Would accidentally blow most of my fresh water reserves on a box of crayons again.","December 25, 2015","true","242.6"," 27 of 28 people (96%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","96","27","28","8","0"

While most people think wizards and dragons when they hear the term roguelike, CoQ instead brings the world to a post-apocalyptic setting somewhere on the planet earth.\n\nAt this point in the distant future, much of the land is a vast salt-desert, interspersed with jungles, mountains and more. The remaining humans and mutants (and even weirder creatures) struggle to survive, traversing the brutal heat and unforgiving landscape with the hope that maybe this settlement will last. Water is the currency of choice; with so much of the land arid, clean water is rare and since life depends on it, unbelivably precious as well. Yet beings have survived and thrived, and the game presents a huge amount of lore in various forms to reflect this.\nAlongside the history is the present, with all the fracturing of groups and the different factions that result from a collapse of modern society. Species hate other species, religions hate other religions, and sometimes the enemy of my enemy is my friend. CoQ has a layered faction system, where the player's actions (and even equipment) can change their standing in the eyes of the denizens of the world.\nAnd with the amount of character customization, your choices will have an impact. From the true humans, non-mutants of various castes and professions, to the mutants, with the huge amount of physical and mental positive and negative mutations, the game can be approached in a vast amount of ways. The specifics are covered elsewhere, but know that builds can go from traditional gunslingers to four-armed, two heart furry ape-like creatures that leak slime and occasionally warp in and out of existence. It's even possible to be hunted by an evil, alternate-dimension version of yourself.\n\nWhat makes Caves of Qud so engrossing and keeps it from collapsing under the weight of the huge amount of features is the streamlining of the classic roguelike experience, especially in regards to the UI. Things just make sense. Very rarely will the game fight against the player, instead they're allowed to lose themselves in the world of Qud. This is even apparent in the graphics; light is cast and blocked by different things, smoke curls and acid spreads, and water will splash as the player runs through.\nThe game now offers tiles, though I'm personally a fan of the ASCII setting after playing it for so long. That doesn't mean the tiles are bad though; in fact it's quite the opposite. Items and enemies are easy to identify, there are various settings to tweak how it looks, and even a fair amount of performance options for players on older computers. It even has music slowly being added, though no sound effects currently. It also supports user mods, for the players who want to add their own changes to the game.\n\n\n\nA final note: Caves of Qud is definitely following the footsteps of traditional roguelikes. The term has been diluted to mean permadeath and maybe randomly generated dungeons, so you can end up with a realtime side scrolling platformer with permadeath being labeled "roguelike". This is not one of those. It's turn-based, requires lots of reading, much trial and error to learn the mechanics, and is meant to be played on a keyboard. It does greatly expand on quite a few of the roguelike traditions, but still keeps the core gameplay of one.","January 27","true","8.8"," 24 of 24 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","24","24","0","0"

Taking a deep breath, I prepared to enter, an- OW, CRUD, WHAT THE - BABBOONS? The apes weren't happy. Obviously, Red Rock was their home, and, screeching and throwing rocks, they were making this displeasure obvious. I readied my carbide sword, and attempted to close. But no, their shrieks turned to ape-chortles, and they drew back, still pelting rocks from every side.

There's a lot of stories in this game, and while, like many roguelikes, it's permadeath, and at first you aren't going to get very far, you're definitely going to have some stories.

If you've had the oppertunity to enjoy such classic games like Nethack or Slash'um you will find yourself playing a game with a rich lore and solid game play.\n\nFor those who never played a /true/ Rogue-like, these games are built to be a challange.\nYou will be fooled, tricked, lured, rewarded and punished while on your adventure.\nYou can expect to get lost, confused or face a situation of untimely death.\nAnd when you die, the only thing carried to the next life is a stronger grip of the game, the lesson that lead to your death.\n\nIn the beginning you will learn how to play the game, and in the end you will learn how to be a better player.\n\nI recommend rogue-likes to people who want to invest time into learning a game, and do not mind restarting a game from the very beginning.\n\nThe games interface while intimidating in the beginning is infact clean and userfriendly to keyboard users, and while it only took me less then 30 minuites to get myself familer with the key binding, if you've not played other rogue likes things will feel out of place. Take this time now to understand you will be mapping skills, you will have a keyboard full of commands like s to search, i for inventory, g to get, c to chat.\n\nAs for the game play, Caves of Qud Delivered something that keeps me playing, It's very interesting combat system and character creation.

There's random dungeons, a set storyline, traditional gameplay, sure. But what makes Caves of Qud stand out amongst the crowd is the sheer mystique of the setting - Qud is a dangerous country in a post-apocalyptic era. Most of the humans (potentially including you) are mutants with strange powers that grant interesting tactical choices. The areas feel extremely unique (a rarity in the roguelike genre) - one area has you rushing to the bottom of a pit on conveyor belts while trying to avoid the toxic inhabitants, another area has a strange mix of machine-worshipping humans and armored trolls in a cyrogenic environment with optional frozen bosses... the list goes on.\n\nCharacter customization is also neat. Beyond mutations, there's also skills, a crafting system, faction relations... It's a bit overwhelming at first. It is fun to eventually grow into a winged psychic with a flamethrower that has a poor relationship with the consortium of plants!\n\nThe combat is by far the neatest thing I've seen in a traditional roguelike. Most of the skills and spells have neat effects tied onto them, and most of the enemies have interesting behavior with their abilities. There's a ton of tactics involved, and mashing the basic attack of moving into enemies is a sure way to die past a certain point in the game.\n\nBeing a roguelike, there is permadeath, BUT you can turn it off if you wanted to. But hey, what kinda roguelike doesn't have permadeath?\n\nIt's also reeeeally difficult. It took me a ton of tries just to get a character past a certain point in the game. Some of it has been rebalanced in the alpha, but you should still prepare to die. And die. And die.\n\nThe major gripes I have with this game are its memory issues (which I'm told are being fixed) and that the tiles can make things look really similar (which can be turned off). It's also still unfinished, so there's that too (though it still takes ~5 hours to beat if you don't die. Protip: you will die).\n\nConclusions:\n+ Excellent lore, setting\n+ Really cool character customization\n+ Interesting combat\n+ Togglable permadeath\n+/- Pretty difficult\n- Memory issues\n- Tiles make everything look really similar (togglable)\n- It's still in early accessm, so it's unfinished","July 15, 2015","true","17.6"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","20","24","0","0"

Oogore is a horned multi-armed regenerating warrior of death. By death I mean he is really efficient in dying, fast. However, the description of the character is not exaggerated, you can make MANY different types of characters with even more different play styles. Caves of Qud is very reminiscent of old D&D style games, with a focus on stats, damage and items. You will find loot, weapons, armor, and many items to improve your character. That is if you can get past the ridiculous difficulty of this game. Qud is far from newbie friendly and is definitely a game that requires many hours of investment. This will put off some players, but the game does have plenty of complexity if you do make the investment. The graphics are completely ASCII along the lines of Quarries of Scred or Sanctuary RPG. There is a huge open world to explore that is procedurally generated, giving the game plenty of replay. Now there is some hiccups along the road as an example  there is currently no music and sound. The games difficulty and lack of tutorials doesn't exactly make it welcoming to new players. There is some graphical issues as well but these are all to be expected for an Early Access title. In all, if you are looking for an older style RPG Roguelike, with an in depth character creator and ever changing environment and brutal difficulty.

(Maybe my favorite game???) The setting is absolutely inspired, and riddled with atmosphere and lore (Books!! So many books!). There's new lore, features, items, abilities, and quests coming out on a weekly basis, the developers really care about this project and it shows. The tiles are gorgeous, and the smoke, fire, flowing water, etc, is a really nice touch. The mechanics go soooo deep, and there's so many options at character creation and a TON of different ways to play the game, and most builds are actually pretty viable if you play your cards right, some just take a lot more awareness and more than a little luck. The faction system is a really nice touch, and can actually be really funny sometimes (Baboons revere you, and consider you one of their own. You are welcomed into their holy places.). I've played hours of this game (More than it shows on steam!! This game has been around for years as a free roguelike.) and it still captures my imagination in the same way. There's no sound yet, unfortunately, but it goes great with something ethereal (Geidi Primes by Grimes mayhap?), because it's, to me at least, got that kind of dreamlike, up-five-hours-past-bedtime-playing-games feeling from when you're a kid.\n\nAnother thing I really like about this game is that you really get into your characters, because of the intense customization, and because of that it feels like this game has a sort of emergent storytelling quality of it. It's really deceptively immersive, and I don't really foresee myself putting this game down anytime soon.","October 21, 2015","true","110.5"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/recommended/333640/","maudish","Audish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/","908 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nHave you ever played a classic roguelike? I'm talking NetHack, ADOM, Dungeon Crawl, any of the games that started life as a nigh-incomprehensible block of ASCII characters. Old roguelikes were big on randomization but low on approachability, requiring you to know all sorts of interactions and tricks and symbols just to avoid dying to a bird or something. Caves of Qud plays like a classic roguelike that prioritizes fun over tricks, and does so with a unique setting and sense of style.\n\nCharacter creation is a major highlight in Qud, allowing you to pick more than just attributes and a class (though even the classes are extremely interesting and varied). Being a post-apocalyptic sci-fi sort of game, you get to be a mutant if you want (yes, you want) and pick special powers from a hefty list of dozens. There's everything from telepathy and night vision to multiple limbs, flight, temporal clones, and mind crushing. These powers are on pretty generous cooldowns, and give you a wealth of tactical options in the game that a lot of roguelikes don't offer. My current best is a four-armed spastic teleporting rogue-thing that can emit sleeping gas or EMPs in emergencies, and I love him to the bits he will eventually be.\n\nOnce your character is made, you get dropped in the little town of Joppa with some intro quests to do and houses to loot. The quests in Qud give some much-needed direction, as the world is quite wide-open and there's plenty of places to get lost and die in. Dungeons are varied between caves, ruins, and higher-tech locales, and you can indeed get lost in the jungles and canyons between them. These places are populated with a colorful cast of creatures including rust crabs, goat men, and sentient ooze. The simple graphics are clear enough to distinguish the people and critters you encounter, and a very helpful Look function gives you all the information you need to know about approaching something new.\n\nIf it seems like I'm gushing about Qud, it's because I've never played a roguelike with so much depth and discovery that, at the same time, has so many user-friendly features. The menus are dense and busy but display everything you need to know in sensible order and with useful icons and colors. Item, skill, and attribute descriptions leave nothing to the imagination, so you'll never be left wondering where you should spend your points. And the quests really are fantastic signposts for the game, giving you more to do than the simple "descend and find the doodad" premises of the classic roguelikes.\n\nIt's not a perfect package, of course. If you've never played a classic-style roguelike there's going to be a significant learning curve, both to the interface and combat. You'll generally have enough tools to get yourself out of bad situations but learning how they work is going to take some experimentation, and it'll often be fatal. The activity log that explains what actions are being taken each turn is also too compressed to be terribly useful, and hopefully it'll be expanded into something easier to parse. There's no sound or music yet either, which makes it a good game to play while listening to music or podcasts but doesn't do any favors in terms of immersion.\n\nThese are all minor quibbles, and ones that will most likely be addressed during Early Access. Caves of Qud is already a rich and deep enough package to lose yourself in for hours on end, with plenty to see and do and try and die to and try again. It may take you some time to come to grips with the old-fashioned displays and interfaces, but the effort is well worth it. Fans of roguelikes, RPGs, sci-fi, and post-apocalyptic games will all find plenty to enjoy here.","December 28, 2015","true","6.8"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","16","19","0","0"

A post-apocalyptic setting done right with a minimum of over-used tropes is the backdrop for your adventure. You begin as a hapless adventurer simply trying to make your way in life, but can progress (with a little luck and a little skill) into a wealthy and powerful figure with an ever-increasing knowledge of the mysterious world in which you live and its exciting ancient past. 10/10.\n\nUI:\nOnce you grasp the basics of the control scheme, the game becomes easier and easier to play. I personally enjoy the all-keyboard control scheme of a well-made roguelike, as it allows me to play the entire game with no more hand motion than it takes me to write this review. This setup can be daunting for newcomers to the roguelike genre or even to experienced dungeon crawlers who are new to this game in particular. The complete lack of mouse support, even in the menus, has been off-putting at times; however, there is an option in one of the menus that claims to activate mouse interactivity (though it seems to do nothing at the time). Perhaps the developers are planning on introducing this feature at some point in the future.\nThe game includes no tutorial for the controls, so a new player has to do some reading and some perusing of the hotkey binding page before they can make much progress in the game. I would hope that at some point in the future the devs introduce some sort of tutorial mode to help out with this.\nOverall, once the controls are mastered and the GUI is understood by the player, it is a system on par with what i would expect from a commercial roguelike, though it could definitely be daunting to a newbie and has no tutorial to explain its intricacies. 6/10.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nAs with the UI, there is no particular gameplay tutorial to help the player become immersed in the game. There are walls of text in the help menus that can, with patience, teach you enough about the game to get started. From there, you're on your own. In some ways, this is interesting, as it forces you to discover each new fact about the game world for yourself, rather than having it spoonfed to you. In other ways, it is frustrating. For example: it took me until my second or third character to understand that _water is the currency_ in this game. The confusion was due in large part to water's being represented by the $ sign in various interfaces.\nThat all being said, once one gets a grasp of the flow of gameplay, it's a wonderful experience that melds with the world and makes me want to play more and more. The procedurally generated game world also draws me in, as I know that playing the game will never simply become a matter of rote memorization. (Has anyone else played 400+ hours of Skyrim? Then you know the feeling.) Overall, 8/10.\n\nCHARACTER OPTIONS:\nThe other daunting aspect for a new player is the sheer volume of choices to make at character creation, with no particular guidance besides (eventually) experience. Again, interesting in that one has to descover working character builds for themselves, but not newbie friendly. This item is double edged though: I have to say that I love nothing more than a system that gives me a full spectrum of options in character creation, especially in a world where having "4 unique classes" is a selling point in some games.\nIn addition to the countless myriad of unique characters that can be created before one even enters the world, the game also features a robust skills tree that allows the player to uniquely customize their character. This skills tree does more than simply "Add 5 to hit with longswords". Almost every perk on the tree features some non-numerical gameplay benefit (your dagger also deals ongoing bleed damage, or your axe can cleave through many foes, or you can pause to take careful aim before firing your raned weapon, etc.), and not every perk on the tree is combat based (there are perks for butchering, harvesting, knowledge of various terrains to allow long distance travel without becoming hopelessly lost, etc.).\nAll in all, I can't wait to try out build after build after build, since there is an enourmous depth of options and combinations of powers to try. 9/10.\n\nTL;DR:\nA great game with a steep learning curve that makes up for its somewhat uninviting front with a rewarding world, gameplay experience, and character custimization options. 9/10.","July 26, 2015","true","11.3"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","11","12","2","0"

I've spent HOURS just figuring out and creating characters. The ability to have mutations AND powers unlocks a lot of potential. The playstyle is very rewarding too (if you don't die of course).\n\nCharacter Creation Pros\n-Immense number of options\n-(Almost) all of the mutations have awesome potential\n-You can make a character arounnd a certain mechanic easily\n\nCons (these are just very specific examples, no problems as a whole)\n-The greybeard class bugs me the ♥♥♥♥ out, it starts with a skill that relies on strength, but selecting that class gives -1 strength\n-Heightened hearing is supposed to detect enemies with a small radius (good for in the dark), and shows a question mark for an enemy. The problem is that it's not guaranteed to detect the enemy within that radius.\n-A few mutations do indirect damage, like corrosive gas generation or beguiling. Meaing that you don't get xp if they die by those means.\n\nGameplay Pros\n- Very difficult but also rewarding\n- Variety of enemies\n- Interesting mechanics\n- There are many ways to kill your enemies\n- You don't have to dedicate to one playstyle, but doesn't force you to play multiple either\n\nCons\n- I have no idea how some of the stats (aside from the 6 stats you can change in the beginning) affect gameplay\n- Because this game is still relatively unkown, you have to find out how damage and such works by yourself. No wiki\n- This is kinda a pro cause if you don't like spoiling stuff from the wiki then more power to you\n- RNGesus is a b*tch (Darkest Dungeon much?)\n\nStoryline Pros\n- Highly immersive\n- Rich and interesting\n- It's actually worth following along\n\nCon\n- I have no idea how to pronouce half of the names. I didn't even say Qud right until I rewatched the video. I've been saying the Q in it like how it is in "quote". Naw its a hard C sound\n\nBut seriously buy this game.

This game is definately not for everyone though. Some people may have an isssue with the graphic style, while others may not appreciate the difficulty of the game. I personally love those factors, they act hommage to the games of yester-year. The wide array of mutations allow for many different play styles, and uncomprimising freedom. Not to mention, the open world environment is vast, with hundreds of chrome caves for you to explore, and inevitably die in.

Caves of Qud is an amazing world that's incredibly interesting to explore plagued with one problem: you spend 95% of your games only exploring the first two caves. Unlike most roguelikes which generate the whole world, Caves of Qud only randomly generates the maps inside of it. You'll always start out in Joppa, and always get the same quests. And you'll probably die incredibly quickly if you don't follow those quests. Once you get out of the rut of doing the same things over and over again, the game is great. There is a small balance issue, in that ego-based characters essentially progress quadratically while physical mutation characters are essentially just better mid/late game than true hunams. Skills really never quite balance up to mutations, and high ego characters essentially get more mutations advancing quicker.\n\nI should mention that my playtime is a little misleading.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/feuerzeuge/recommended/333640/","feuerzeuge","fleur","http://steamcommunity.com/id/feuerzeuge/","211 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI picked this up because I was intrigued by the science-fantasy setting: the game takes place on what is presumably Earth, far in the future, amidst the ruins of a long-dead civilization that is now long dead, with the remnants of humanities scattered between various tribes and feudal holdfasts. It's a nice mix of ancient sensibilities and high-tech sorcery that hearkens back to a bygone era of pulp sci-fi.\n\nUpon starting the game proper, I was pleasantly surprised by the level of customization permitted during character creations - mutant characters get the brunt of the options, in the forms of various mutations which can vary from small stat bonuses to special combat abilities to mutations that can drastically change the way the game is played. Pure humans, on the other hand, get to pick from one of several classes that will decide their starting skills and gear.\n\nOn entering the game world and getting into the thick of it, I somehow found my way to the faction page and found out that not only does each phylum of the animal kingdom have its own faction but that they're all after my blood, with the sole exception of the antelopes, with whom I've somehow managed to maintain cordial relations. On one of my trips to the beginners' dungeon, I was beset upon and ruthlessly torn apart by a pack of baboons, quickly confirming the faction screen's insinuations. The gameplay is the usual roguelike fare - delving into dungeons and fending off ravenous furries, robots and said fauna, collecting treasure (swords, axes, woven bracelets, shotguns, high-tech gizmos and combat drugs) and gaining levels.\n\nThe skill system in this game is well done - rather than gaining small incremental bonuses for pumping points into skills, every available upgrade to your skills carries a discrete benefit and/or ability. For example, when upgrading the long blades skill, you can choose the interception ability, which gives you a small chance of attacking any enemy that moves into an adjacent space for free and an activated stance that ensures you automatically intercept for a number of turns. The fact that gaining skills and growing in power actually affords new tactical opportunities rather than just embiggening numbers is one of this game's definite strengths. The huge amount of possible combinations of gear, stats, mutations and abilities mean that you'll have limitless options as to how to build your character.\n\nAlso rather unusually for a roguelike, this game has quests, and what appears to be a storyline. One downside is that those I've encountered so far appear to be fixed and do not vary from playthrough to playthrough, which does detract from the novelty a bit. I've not yet played far enough to tell for sure, but it does appear that they can be safely skipped, for the most part, though my compulsive nature has lead them to feeling more like chores to be repeated after each death rather than the interesting opportunities they were at first.\n\nAs for the simulation aspects, I'm not rightly sure how deep they go. It's certainly nowhere near Dwarf Fortress adventure mode's level of granular simulation, as numerous elements appear to stay the same across different playthroughs, and some things appear to not be simulated at all. This isn't a bad thing, however, since in lieu of DF's maniacal obsession with detail, this game provides basic gameplay mechanics that are far more fun, it runs better, and not having to rely on generated conversations and descriptions allows the devs to infuse it with far more flavour and atmosphere, creating an experience which is a lot more coherent and quite a bit less samey than DF's adventure mode.\n\nOverall, I've played this game for only 4 hours as of writing this, and I've only explored a miniscule corner of the game world. If you like Roguelikes and RPGs in general, this game is a steal at 10 bucks. My only complaint is the unremovable CRT filter and the low contrast colour settings, which I've admittedly grown used to by now, but which I'd still rather turn off if I were given the option.","July 21, 2015","true","19.1"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","2"

If you like Nethack, Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup, etc, this is right up your alley. If you're a fan of some of the old post-apocalyptic games like Gamma World, or the old Fallout/Wasteland series, you'll get a kick out of this.","July 15, 2015","true","24.7"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

It's odd placing the acronyms "HD" and "ASCII" next to each other, but there really isn't a better way to describe the game. it keeps true to it's heritage of Dos based roguelikes, from it's HD ASCII visuals, to it's keyboard command scheme. Even the mechanics and visuals are redesigned versions of what you may find in games like Rogue or Dwarf Fortress.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6BngOmzxv0\nIf you've never played an ASCII Roguelike game before, getting into Caves of Qud, could prove challenging. It won't control like modern games, forgoing mouse and gamepad, and sticking strictly to keyboard commands. There is a help menu which I highly recommend any new player to check before proceeding. But once you get over the learning curve, you'll find an expansive randomly generated world to explore, with a ton of replay and experimentation potential. You'll be able to create your own class, and tackle the game's quest and world as you see fit. It's wide, expansive, and deep.\n\nVisually it may look unimpressive at first glance, but when you compare it to it's original ASCII version you can clearly see where all the work went into. Instead of actual ASCIIs as representation of the characters and the world, the game uses low-fi sprites that carry a similar visual feel of ASCIIs. Even the font choice and spacing is carefully designed to remind us of older times, while keeping things modern and easily read. There is no sound to speak of, no music, no midis. The game is in early access so it could be something to be added later, however, I suspect the omission is done intentionally, as the original Caves of Qud featured no sounds as well.\n\nThe game is fantastic, even as a player who've never played a whole lot of ASCII games in the past, but with that said, it's not perfect. Though the lack of sound could of been done deliberately, I'd still prefer if it featured some midi sounds to go with it. Also the initial area is consistent and always the same, with areas outside of the starting point being RNG. This coupled with the high learning curve of Caves of Qud will make the initial few tries at the game feel more tedious than if it was also randomly generated as well.\n\nOverall Caves of Qud is what I'd like to consider "The Pillars of Eternity of Roguelikes". Much like Pillars of Eternity, Caves of Qud keeps true to both the gameplay and visuals of it's inspired genre, without sacrificing the original's spirit, all while being an immensely enjoyable experience.\n\nPros:\n- Great looking "HD" ASCII sprites and design\n- Keeps true to it's heritage\n- Deep and engrossing\n- Endless experimentation and replayability\n\nCons:\n- Might not be for every one\n- No sounds","August 7, 2015","true","5.3"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

With little to no explanation and zilch in the way of a tutorial, the game rewards trial and error, while laughing in the faces of those impatient or easily enraged.\n\nThe starting area of Joppa, is static and you will always start 'here', there are characters to talk to and some early missions to be had. Being the permadeath-fest that it is, the lack of a dynamic starting point may become repetitive to you, but I found it as a haven upon which to launch my next doomed-to-fail attempt, at discovering just what the hell I was supposed to be doing.\nJoppa, described as an oasis-village, is such. A ray of familiarity in an otherwise blotched out world of unpredictability.\n\nCOQ (hehe), features heavy RPG elements and levelling is a requirement. This, in-spite of the frequent permadeath and subsequent character creation, never feels too 'grindy'.\nI found myself encouraged to try one more run, rather than put off by a lacking sense of achievement.\n\nAsking price is fair, in my opinion. Though edging on steep when judged against its competition. There is a free version (minus the minimalistic tile-set) floating about, so you can try before you commit to supporting its further development.\n\nIn conclusion, Caves of Qud is a true rogue-like with very few bells but a whole bag of whistles. For those with the constitution, a rich and open ended experience awaits.","July 22, 2015","true","18.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

The amount of hours you will get out of this is literally up to you.\n\nWhat excites me the most about this is that it takes a more modern approach to the classic roguelike experience. So, you have the ASCII-ish graphics (there is a tileset, but it is primitive) mixed with sandbox gameplay that is *nearly* limitless with what you do and how you go about doing things. True-to-roguelike-form it is also hard as nails and rewards knowledge of previous play-throughs. Best of all, it is still in developement. This means we get to experience changes and new things as we play over time.\n\nI particularly like the pseudo-switch from traditional 'magic' to 'mutations', and all that comes along with that.\n\nPros:\n+Tileset is pretty sweet, and the devs have said there will be an option to switch them out to user-made sets\n+Dialogue is well written, and is hand-crafted (compared to generated)\n+Map is *nearly* infinite - but the best part is that most of it exists underground a la DF style!\n+I particularly like using just a keyboard so I can lay in bed with a laptop and play (although mouse support will be added, as it is already in the menu options)\n+The far-future universe is pretty cool!\n+I actually really like the hunger/thirst system. Its balanced quite well so its not a grind. It also fits with the universe set in place (Mad Max-ish)\n\nCons:\n-No music, yet, but obviously this will be implemented\n-Need an option to zoom - as others have said - the tiles are a bit too small\n-It may need some optimization for slightly slower machines\n-Could benefit from an online leaderboard, or even the MSORPG chat elements in ToME\n\nHaving a modern roguelike of this nature, at this price, is simply amazing for any fan of the genre.","July 20, 2015","true","24.4"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","10","15","2","0"

The character creation was an especially high point for me, as the possibilities for mutated humans are very fun to play with. Caves of Qud is also extremely giving content-wise, which is clear as after dying and restarting for the umpteenth time the merchant in Joppa (the starting town) still offers different equipment than any previous playthrough.

CoQ is one of the most visually impressive ASCII-games out there, and the new tileset used in the Unity Engine improves the look while still keeping the very minimalistic genre-typical aesthetic. The game has a lot of its own weird mechanics for a roguelike, most notably the mutation system that puts a different spin on every run. I haven't gotten that far into the game yet as the early game is incredibly difficult, but I already consider this one of my favorite Roguelikes out there with ADOM and Stone Soup, so if you like those games, definitely give Caves of Qud a shot.\n\nWorth noting, I don't normally buy into Early Access stuff anymore, but developer Freehold Games have been showing a lot of commitment to this project, with pretty substantial weekly updates every friday.

It's still early access, so there's some typos here and there, but I have not run into any game-breaking issues in nearly 10 hours. It's all the radness of the original free roguelike with some frankly awesome art assets thrown in. But basically: if you like Nethack or other deep/procedurally generated worlds and also think post-apocalyptic science fiction is fun (i.e. Stalker, Fallout) then you should definitely give this a look. Mutations when you level up, pre-war tech as mysterious artifacts, a harsh, unforgiving world, more weirdness than you can shake a snapjaw corpse at, it's all dope.","July 16, 2015","true","9.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Some seem a bit cramped and cluttered, but you get used to it.\n\nI want to leave this on a good note though: as I understand, Caves of Qud has been in development for a LONG time (like 10+ years, I think) and the game is totally playable and has a nice amount of polish for an Early Access game.

Mutations, guns, water currency, artifacts, sentient plants -check!  This game is a full-fledged roguelike -random enemies and random loot are wrapped up in procedurally-generated landscapes.   Storyline quests are available to keep you busy if you don't want to just wander.   You can choose between mental and physical mutations and there are a nice selection of them.   There is also a fantastic collection of enemies to encounter.  It reminds me a bit of T.O.M.E., but with a post-apocalyptic feel and a much different UI.\n\nIt was easy to get started after a few minutes of reading the list of 10 things to do first (hint: press F1 when you start).  My third character survived clearing out the 5th level of red rocks depths, and even if he didn't make it out alive, that's OK!\n\nI like the interface in 1080p on my living room TV.

Holy crud, Ive seen finished games that werent this huge and complex. The free ASCII version is good, this is f'n awesome,\n________________\nOk. If youre a fan of true Roguelikes- not the games that have random generation and permadeath and so are labeled "roguelike" just based on that fact - but real true top down randomly generated RPGs that use keyboard commands, have a  ton of variable randomly generated content and options, turn based, simple tile graphics but are incredibly complex and fun, then  you MUST get this game. Its been around for a bit in a free ASCII format, but this is the new and improved and worth paying for version.\n\nIts great. I used to play the ASCII Roguelikes back in the day (Moria, *Angband etc), but Ive gotten to the point where I like tiles. And CoQ has them. Simple tiles, yes, and they aren't all done. But at least you're not squinting and trying to remember if the blue s was a simple water snake or a terrible siren that will charm you before she beats you to death.\n\nTheres no sound ort music yet, but that is something that the devs are planning on putting in.\nUnlike most Roguelikes. this one is Sci Fi/Fantasy, which is cool. It reminds me of a sci-fi-ish DarkSun, that awesome D&D world from the '90s. Qud appears to be a ruined dry world, full of sentient plants, caves, little water, ancient tech, giant insects etc. Its really unique and fun.\n\nTheres two races, mutated human and True Kin each with a HUGE amount of unique-to-that-race sub options to really customize your PC. Mutated Humans are weaker than True Kin but get mutation points. The points allow them to buy physical or mental mutations (positive traits) and defects, which are detrimental but give you more mutation points. I dont know how many mutations and defects you can choose from, but it looks like at least 70 or so. Mutants also get 12 classes to choose from, and none of them are like "fighter" "mage" "priest". They are all unique, nomads, tinkers, merchants, wardens etc. True Kin have better starting attributes, no mutations and can choose 1  of 12 "castes" (classes - again they are pretty unique), also choosing a caste chooses the arcology you come from. There are 3 arcologies, each with 4 castes. THey appear to be the "shut away in the high-tech place protected from the wasteland" type race, while the Mutants are the "scrabbling dirt-grubbers trying to survive in the toxic wastelands".\n\nThe world is HUGE and expansive, even in its unfinished state. Theres also a main storyline, another thing most Roguelikes lack (beyond the "get to the bottom of the dungeon and bring the Amulet of Yendor back out" type plots), in addition to the "bring me a whatzit from the wherezit" type quests you see in many Roguelikes tkat actually have towns and NPCs you can talk to.\n\nThe game is still in EA, and the devs are adding more content and bugstomping. The main questline isnt finished, But even in EA, its totally worth picking up. I never buy EA games, I usually wishlist them until completion. But Ive seen "full release" games that werent this complex and fun.","July 18, 2015","true","66.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Buy it if you're into character creation.\n\nCaves of Qud is a rogue-like RPG, but where it really shines is character creation and experimentation. The idea is that you're set in a world so far into the future that everything is unrecognizeable. The range of abilities you can have is very extensive, though hindered slightly by the constant death. If you're not into restarting the entire game every time you accidentally die, I highly recommend you turn off permadeath.\n\nThat being said, I get the feeling that Qud is meant to be extremely deep. It wants to be a deep and complex world teeming with politics and people. However, because of the permadeath, I think there's a strong need for the development to be focused on the "wide" aspect rather than the "deep" aspect. The story (as far as I know) isn't completely finished, and while the new features are very helpful and fun, there is very little attention given to the later stages of the game.\n\nThe game is still very fun though.\n\nPros:\n-Faction system makes certain creatures friendly while others might hate you\n-Very interesting world with unique lore\n-In-depth character creation that makes it exciting to experiment\n-Memorable story\n\nCons:\n-Unfinished story\n-Mouse input is very limited\n-At times, the world feels too random\n\nOverall, I'd recommend this game. Good value for the price and the developer is a nice guy.\n8/10.","May 30","true","58.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/OtterA/recommended/333640/","OtterA","The Semp","http://steamcommunity.com/id/OtterA/","660 products in account","Early Access Review\n\n"Oh ♥♥♥♥," I think to myself as crocodile bites into my flesh. I assumed that I could beat the glorified lizard like I could in so many other games. I was wrong. This was just the first of many deaths I would experience in my first couple of hours with the game.\n\nTL;DR at the bottom.\n\nI'm an unabashed fan of roguelikes. The focus on character building and death meaning something have always been a huge draw to me. If you look at my library, I have a lot of these suckers. You may wonder if there's still games in the genre that can still surprise me. The answer is HELL YES. Caves of Qud is one such game.\n\nThrow out the typical fantasy setting you probably picture when you think of a roguelike. This is the post-apocalypse and your two choices are to play as a pure or mutated human. I've tried both and the latter seems to be way more fun. It kind of reminds me of the episodes of Futurama with the mutants in the sewer. You can turn yourself into all kinds of monstrosities, and I suspect the number of options will only grow over time. My most recent playthrough I decided to take a mutation which gave me flaming hands. I didn't realize it meant I would never be able to wear gloves. This is a great illustration of the mutation system: most of the time it involves trade offs, especially for the really fun powers, like being made up of quills like a porcupine (a personal favorite).\n\nThe graphics are ASC, but put through a filter that makes it look like you're playing on a much older computer. One that may or may not be from before your time. I personally love the look of it, but the result makes it deceptively system intensive.\n\nThe controls will be divisive to the say the least. Some will be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ that the controls are so obtuse, though once you play with them for a while they do start to feel natural. They can all be rebound though, and if you're willing to put in the effort to do so you can bind them in any way that your heart desires!\n\nI haven't even explored a fraction of the world yet, nor have I managed to complete the first quest I was given. There are still enemies that would seem menial in other games that can kill me if I'm not careful. Call me a masochist but this is more than a little bit exciting to me. Two hours into a game I generally feel like I get what's going on, but here I'm still trying to figure out what exactly I'm supposed to do. The procedurally generated, fully destructable world is huge, and I get the feeling that even without permadeath (that is an option for those who are turned off by having to reroll all the time) the game would be collosal.\n\nIf you're into that kind of thing, there's tons of lore here too. More than I'll ever manage to sift through realistically. It's a world of mutants and sentient bears; the writing ain't half bad either.\n\nNegatives are that the game uses far more system resources than it needs to. It looks pretty, but functionality trumps graphics, especially in a roguelike. Also, the game isn't friendly to those who aren't willing to be patient with it. You'll die a lot before you start to see successes. Then you'll continue to die frequently. That can be disheartening and will certainly put off some players. This game is harder than Nethack in my opinion, and that's not something I would say lightly. Tutorials would be a welcome feature, more than just a series of paragraphs to read in the help section.\n\nTL;DR: This is the roguelike for the true hardcore roguelike player. It's tough, it's massive, and inventive enough that I feel like telling my friends about the porcupine-beetle-man hybrid that I rolled last time. For an early access title its chock full of content.

Items run the same gamut, from wooden clubs to shotguns to antimatter powered ray guns.\n\nThe storyline is currently unfinished, but CoQ is so difficult it will probably be finished well before I ever reach the end.

There are light elements of survival with some needs for food and water, and you are also able to make new stuffs if you happen to come across the 'data disk' for you and if you have the necessary skills. Being a traditional rogue-like also means graphics is restricted to ASCII or tiles (static icons effectively) so kindly do not expect to see the fringe of your character’s hair flowing in the breeze.\n\nIs it fun?\nRogue-likes us]ed to exist at a time which requires people to use their imagination, and so it is only as fun as you imagine it to be. That said, the lack of graphics also mean more effort can be put into crafting deeper lore, additional content and balancing game mechanics instead of having to fiddle around with body proportions and rag-doll physics. Considering that you can choose to play a mutant with multiple hands, legs and heads (just two), perhaps it’s better not to fiddle around with the rag-doll physics too. Fun is when you actually make an effort to overcome an in-game obstacle and take pleasure in doing so, or when you prevent your next character’s death by learning from his/her predecessor’s demise. Fun is also when you are able to get randomized loot, crappy or otherwise, and make the most out of them. Fun too, is when you beat bad RNG odds to survive. Fun is all of the above; everything else is merely enjoyable at best.\n\nDoes it look good?\nIt looks as good-looking as alphabets and sentences can be. There’s quite a bit of reading to do, mostly flavor text and background lore and whether you might be dying or not, or did you lose a limb or two. Other than these, graphically-representative icons are all that you have to feed your imagination with.\n\nMillion dollar question (or whatever price the game is), is it worth buying?\nThere is a free ASCII version on the developer’s website (freeholdgames.com) which you may wish to download and check out for yourself on the content and gameplay. I would also advise watching a few Let’s Play episodes somewhere to gauge if you can dedicate the hours needed to enjoy the game.

There are survival-related elements without them being overbearing. It's difficult! There are pre-determined dungeons with somewhat randomized set-up with story behind them. There is a ton of randomized stuff outside those that you can explore. The game is utterly huge (check the world map, wouldn't be surprised if there were a 200,000+ zones in it).\n\nIt definitely is a long-form roguelike though, so don't expect to finish quickly and be prepared to lose a lot with each permadeath.

It's got plenty of procedurally generated caves and ruins to explore scattered across a large overworld, all tied together by a quest line rife with side-quests. At least, that's what it aims to be eventually; currently, the main quest line is not finished, and many side quests remain unimplemented as of the writing of this review. Despite this, there's tons of content to discover and die by.\n\nEven though the quest line is unfinished, you will die many, many times before you reach the end (you'll know when it stops, if you make it that far). The difficulty and frequency of death allows you to explore the rich character creation system the game is packing. This system offers many options, allowing you to choose whether you begin as a mutant (slower skill point gain, but gains useful mutations) or a True Man (higher starting attributes, and increased skill point gain). From there, you've got a number of physical/mental mutations (for mutants) or castes (for True Men) to choose from. Additionally, Qud offers you a skill tree of sorts as you level up, allowing you to gain abilities as you grow more experienced. Oh, and dialogue trees!\n\nThough it may be difficult to get in to, Caves of Qud offers a unique,engaging, and deeply rewarding rpg experience. I wholeheartedly recommend it to people interested in the genre, or to anyone interested in being mauled by a sleepy panther-bear because they spontaneously combusted while sneaking past it.","July 15, 2015","true","33.3"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","53","8","15","7","0"

You start out in a water-farming town on the outskirts of a giant salt desert, performing tasks for villagers that are convinced their precious (even sacred) crops are being preyed upon by something mysterious. According to the developers, the world is influenced by Dune and Morrowind, among other interesting sources and the world reflects this in its alien atmosphere.\n\nCharacter creation has tons of depth and I'm still trying to decide whether it's better to use my mutation points to fly around and toss grenades crafted from destroyed robots from the sky, or teleport up close and kill my enemies in bursts of quills sprouting from my body.\n\nThere's no doubt the game is difficult. After 10 hours, I've barely scratched the surface of the story as my character keeps dying in fresh and joyous ways. If you're new to roguelikes, be warned that they are completely unforgiving. Compared to others in the genre, Caves of Qud provides more intuitive controls and a less overwhelming character creation. Still, it's tough getting started. However the initial unfamiliarity with the game's mechanics will go away, if you're willing to die a few dozen times.","July 25, 2015","true","20.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There is a lot of depth of gameplay here, but you're constantly fighting against the User Interface and the way the map works more than the monsters themselves.\n\nYou will constantly find yourself bumping into walls you can't see because rather than keeping the game world centered on the player, you're going from screen to screen. It feels very clunky and it constantly takes me out of the experience. There is a giant box of information to one side of the screen that blocks a huge portion of the map, but for how big it is, it really doesn't tell you a whole lot.\n\nAnother annoyance is the auto-explore AI. It is extremely poor. It skips over items you have on auto-pickup, and it's constantly getting stuck on nothing when the screen is nowhere near fully explored.\n\nThe game also seemed to discourage exploring too deep into any given cave - there are dead ends everywhere, and no easy way to backtrack like in most roguelikes. I was very disappointed that there didn't seem to be any way to get back to the surface other than the way I came, forcing me to try to retrace my steps over an hour and a half.\n\nAnother issue I had with the game is the performance - you would think such a simple looking game would run smooth as silk, but this game has to stop and think an awful lot. I didn't get far into the game and the files it generated on my computer total up to 385MB - 60MB for the save file, 60MB for a backup of that save file, and an enormous amount of cache. Like many early access titles, this game really needs some optimization done to it, but it's just surprising to see it from a game like this.\n\nI feel like the entire engine needs to be rebuilt from the ground up, getting rid of the per-screen nonsense and keeping the world centered on the player, and with a much better User Interface. I really wanted to like this game, but I just don't. It needs to be better.","November 8, 2015","false","8.7"," 17 of 35 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","17","35","0","1"

A community of watervine farmers, I ask around for some poor saps in need of my skills.  I eventually find a young man by the name of Mehmet, who claims that the community's water vines have been ravaged by unknown critters north in Red Rock.  I traveled along too the destination in question and delved down into the depths of Red Rock itself.  After many hardships, I discover the creatures responsible for it, slaying one quickly and taking it's carcass back to Joppa where I'd present it to Mehmet for verification.  When I had arrived back at the village, everything was normal as ever.  As I took steps back toward Mehmet though, things took a turn for the worst.  A lightning bolt of cosmic proportions decended upon the poor, unsuspecting soul as if summoned by Thor himself.  Within a split second, Mehmet had died before my eyes, his body blown to nothingness making my effort all for naught.  Stricken with sorrow for the poor farmer, I wandered too the salt flats to the west, where the only thing I had to look forward too was death by dehydration which came quickly, ending Leaf Licker's life in moments.\n\nPlant/10","July 28, 2015","true","17.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I'm a longtime classic roguelike fan: NetHack, ToME, Brogue, Sil. I also love a lot of modern ones: SotS the Pit, FTL, Isaac. This game is so immersive and hits all the right roguelike buttons that I will undoubtedly spend hundreds of hours in this game. It also updates UI and concepts to be in line with modern notions of great game design.\n\nThe character creation alone is the best I've played. I can't imagine running out of fun and interesting new ways to play the game. Even if I get so good I can run the game with a bunch of obvious builds, there are tons of ways to keep making it challenging. Each tweak makes the game totally different.\n\nThe tiles are beautiful. The story is fascinating (by story, I mean the fact that relationships between different groups are procedurally generated). I understand putting off getting this until it moves out of early access, but you should know that it is fully worth the price as is.","July 19, 2015","true","11.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Seeing the untaped potential within, i made him my disciple and gave him a shotgun. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ shot me in the back in the next fight. obviously being a tortoise, he shoots like Cheney. with that lesson learned, i gave him some chainmail and took back my gun and we went on our merry way. where he murdered everything in sight.\n\nOf all the rogue likes ive played, Caves of Qud is by far one of the best of the Classic/tradition styles. only really topped by Dwarf Fortress in depth in both story and similation. while you may not be able to throw a rabbit with enough force to decaptitate a cyclops, you can freeze it solid and shoot it with a rocket launcher.\n\nOf course the only real flaw with the game for the genre, is being of the classic style, it has archaic controls, being pretty much completely keyboard based. (part of the charm in my book, but it can get annoying at times)\n\nAnother issue you may come across (besides the genre specific issues such as difficulty) would be figuring out whats going on at times. the tiles are amazing and make things significantly easier, but they still dont stop the age old issue of too much clutter. I've had many a character die because i didnt realize that an enemy aproached me, or was even on screen, though a simple fix for this would be to highlight hostile NPCs.\n\nthe only other issue new players may run into, would be the simple lack of ingame information. some of it can be obtained through books and such ingame, but many things such as mutations developed after starting a character, have no info to them, thus having the wiki or google up is a must for all but the most veteran of players.\n\nIn summary, if you love classic rogue likes, like dwarf fort, this game is a must have, however it has the same issues and complexity that plagues that part of the genre. if you are on the fence still, or are new to the genre, i'd highly recomend watching some youtube videos before purchase, the genre isnt for everyone.","August 12, 2015","true","95.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jacmin/recommended/333640/","jacmin","jm","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jacmin/","440 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nCaves of Qud is a "science-fantasy" roguelike by Freehold Games. It's currently in Early Access, but I've already gotten a lot of hours of enjoyment out of the beta. It has a lot to offer for those who enjoy exploratory dungeon crawling, tense strategic situations, varied playstyles, and a good deal of mystery in their games. Here are some of the highlights, in my opinion:\n\nCharacter creation: Your character can be created with a huge number of physical and mental mutations, and gain more as you level up. These act as your spells and passive bonuses, and come in a really wide variety of forms. Physically control your adrenal glands for a quick boost of speed in combat, release an EMP to disable enemy grenades and robots, or even manipulate time to produce several clones of yourself. Trying out new combinations of mutations really keeps me coming back to the game. My only real complaint is that, at the time of this review, physical mutations seem less powerful and interesting than mental mutations overall. Rebalancing is sure to come in the future.\n\nIf you're looking for an alternate playstyle, you can also choose for your character to be a "true kin," a non-mutant human who lacks special powers but starts with useful artifacts and higher stats.\n\nThe gameplay: True to its genre, Qud has randomly generated levels, randomized loot, and permadeath. If the latter is really a dealbreaker for you, it is possible to turn it off in the "debug" option category. Graphics are either ASCII or a clean, if simple, set of tile icons.\n\nUnlike other staples of the genre such as Nethack, there is not one ultimate goal (fetch the amulet) but a series of main quests with other objectives you can find on the side. There are also various ways to complete the quests, from what I've seen. Another feature of Qud is the world map, which can be used to quickly travel between locations in the game at the cost of running down your hunger and thirst quicker.\n\nEnemy balance is pretty good, in my experience: you may run into a really strong monster, but as long as you stop to think, there is usually a way for you to escape and return later.\n\nThe world: Caves of Qud takes place in a setting where it seems as if almost anything goes - yet, it's very good at hitting its own specific tone. The weird world of Qud, while putatively post-apocalyptic, has a lot more in common with The Dark Tower than Fallout. The dead civilizations you ransack are old, and the artifacts you dig up range from your everyday hand grenade to more exotic types such as the "shade oil injector," which will cause you to phase out of reality for a little while. I admit I am a bit of a sucker for the trope of forgotten technology aging and turning into artifacts of myth, and Qud does pull it off well. Lore is tantalizingly doled out in item descriptions and NPC dialogue.\n\nOverall, I'm very excited to watch Caves of Qud develop. It's already quite large in scope, and should only be getting better. As another plus, the devs seem to take player feedback very seriously and are active in the forums.\n\n","August 19, 2015","true","58.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I liked the character creation and the sheer amount of options: I can play different play styles.  I liked that there are different monsters and items.  I disliked the quests; the first quest of defeating a monster in an ancient ruin was well done, but the other quest for recovering an artifact in the Rust Wells was really bad.\nI traversed all over those wells defeating a ton of monsters and I found not a single artifact.  Then I looked online and I found that most people just buy or steal an artifact while in town and pass that on to the quest-giver.\nBefore this game I had never thought about the criticality of music in a game; after playing this for several hours the deafening silence was maddening.  I started playing iTunes and that helped only marginally.\nThe game does have a phenomenal game mechanic, it's just that the quests and the sounds are lacking.","October 11, 2015","false","9.3"," 7 of 33 people (21%) found this review helpful","21","7","33","0","0"

If not just pass on and look for something else.\nOf the dozen or so characters i made in the last hour only one was actually able to kill a few plants and fish in the waters just outside of town before he got jumped by what looked like an alligator and died in two hits.  Two other characters managed to find stairs out in the middle of nowhere leading down (Dont go down!)  The first died as soon as he entered, the second took exactly one step before he was one hit killed. Oh and there is no running away from your attackers or using obstacles to escape.  They follow rentlessly and other critters that dont join the hunt ignore you as do any npcs you run screaming past.\nOn the positive side, I liked the music, which was very moody erieee and caught me by surprise a few times as it does not play constantly so when it starts up it can actually sound alot louder than it actually is.  I also loved the "tile set."  While very simple in detail it was immediately recognizable and the fade in and out across the screen as things become lit up (LOS can see it) and darkened when obscured from view creates almost a hypnotic effect that draws you into the "surroundings."\nOf course the game is in early access and so if the creators decide to change things up and actually give a person a chance to connect, grow and enjoy their characters some I might actually be able to enjoy the game some and change my review.  As it is i can think of better ways to spend the 5 minutes or so it takes to create a character and get it killed.","February 3","false","3.4"," 3 of 26 people (12%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","12","3","26","2","2"

It's really nicely put together, well polished and with great writing. If the concept appeals to you then you'll probably enjoy it; I don't think there are any nasty surprises. Only thing I will say is that permadeath doesn't really feel right here - but you can turn it off, so it's not really a complaint.\n\nLooking forward to seeing how development pans out!","March 18","true","20.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you like rougelikes (real rougelikes, not rougelights) then this is a must have. Only problem is lack of quests which I'm almost certain will be addressed over time. The game gets weekly updates and the dev team seem very pationate","March 17","true","16.1"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

The setting is probably what makes this game stand apart from other roguelikes. It's got a neo-futuristic setting kinda like if fallout were more modern (and a whole lot more mutants).\n\nIt's kind of a more basic Cataclysm: DDA for those familiar with that.","April 26","true","23.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
