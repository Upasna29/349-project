"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zargul/recommended/402160/","Zargul","Zârgùl","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zargul/","148 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nPersonally, I cannot recommend this game... at the moment!\nI've played it a little bit, lots of features were really glitchy or missing completely.\n\nSo did I have always terrible tempered crewmembers, invisible damage to the Ship, glitchy crew combat, getting blown to pieces at a station as like Medics not healing others.\n\nThe fact that most major features are barely working and are massively bugged makes the game not worth buying if you don't want to support the devs directly.\n\nStill I'm looking forward if the Devs will update it regularly.\n\n\nReview Update: 03.Oct.2015:\n________________________\n\nThe Updates made the game slightly more enjoyable, still there are a lot of imbalances which makes the game rather unplayable than anything else.\n\nShip Combat works okayish. Problem is rather to identify who is your enemy.\nThere are some problems like:\n-You cannot charge your shields when on Green-Alert.\n-I was able to use the machine-gun perfectly fine but suddendly the torpedo-launcher didn't want to fire anymore despite having ammunition. After clicking the button I only was able to target, not to fire anymore.\n-Shielded Enemies are tough as hell. I don't even want to try to fight against them, since it feels to imbalanced.\n\n\nThe biggest fix I felt was for Crewmanagement:\n-Finally your Crew takes care of themselves...  more or less.\n-Crew still suffers massively during yellow and red alert. This is quite imbalanced and probably one of the only negative influences of mood.\n-Bug where you can spam-click conversation, so your Crew gains mood by talking to eachother.\n-Bug where your captain ranks up and gets forced into a new uniform. Makes little sense to me.\n-Bug where your captain (after ranking up) starts to have an invisible mood, including negative perks.\n\nThere are also some other minor problems like trading problems and UI showing the wrong Icons but afterall this Update satisfies me a little bit more.\n\nReview Update: 10.Oct.2015:\n________________________\n\nHell, what shall I say?\nThe Game is finally in a state where you can call it playable and I really need to praise the Devs for pushing it that far.\nIt feels much more stable, the UI is mostly clean with only very few bugs that are not game-breaking,\n\nThe exploit of spam-talking to Crewmember still works, but if you play without this, you will notice that some balancing has been done.\n\nShields drain rather quickly on both sides and destroying an enemy ship seems now more possible than ever.\n\nWhat is rather bugging me is repairing own damage. While some indicators are obvious through flashing, I was never able to repair the Ship to 100% Hull-Strength.\n\nLife on the Ship is still quite unfinished, but works more or less in it's current state.\nCrew gains a mood-boost through the TV, Sleep and Food-Paterns are solid.\n\nMood-Drop during Code Yellow and Red is still severe, maybe too severe, but that's probably because stabilizing it is still quite hard without the exploit.\n\nMore leisure activities (maybe connecting several objects together like Comfy-Chair + TV = More Fun/Mood + Energy Boost) and using the Bar of Space Stations for Crew leaves would make the whole thing much much more interesting and could even balance it out.\n\n\nWell, currently the game has only very few bugs (The most hilarious was a Pirate that space-walked outside of my ship) that were in all cases not game-breaking for me.\nWould I recommend it?\nIf you search for something that is long-time fun, no.\nIt is stil a very early Alpha at least, consisting the skeleton of the game.\nBut I believe the Devs can make this game top if they want to.\nAnd this is why I'd recommend buying this game: Supporting the Devs so they can implement more features and especially modding.\n\nAfter all I've seen, they are communicative, and eager to push the game forward.\nThey managed to make the whole thing playable and this says something!\nAll I hope for is, that this won't end like another sandbox spacegame.\n\nReview Update: 24.Oct.2015:\n________________________\n\nAlpha Six is up and running and to be honest, the game feels much much more balanced and stable.\nWorrying about Crew has finally ceased and they mostly seem to go their own way. (Eventhough it seems they oversleep sometimes, but I haven't investigated in this specific problem that much)\n\nSo I got the first mission and headed into unknown space, just to realize that there's one thing that is quite confusing: With all the ships around you, you do not really know who is your enemy or not.\nAt least for me it was hard to determine, and so I accidentially blew another ship up which was not my target.\n\nAfter another Jump and 5 minutes of ship to ship combat, I destroyed the target. The explosion of the ships look a bit clumsy sometimes, but well it's an Alpha.\n\nAt around 10% hull integrity I brought the ship back to the station, just to realize that repairing it is quite a nuisance, especially since it's quite vital. So I went with my Security Officer to the Station to buy some more food, ammo and spare parts just to find quite a big glitch where I could buy food... and it would buy the food I've already placed into my ship.\n\nSo I bought my own food again and also lost the 100 points I placed.\nOther things couldn't get placed and literally vanished while other stuff in the vendor was non-interactable.\n\nI've made three new Screenshots to show the few bugs I've encountered.\n\nIn general the game is much more stable, it feels less like a tech-demo but still quite sparse.\nGameplay is indeed there, eventhough it's not feeling smooth, but it shows off that the Developers are able to keep up to their word.\nI'm seriously looking forward to Alpha Seven since planets were a thing that was advertised in a pretty big way and eventually with more content, Star Command Galaxies is getting more interesting in the long run.\n\n\nReview Update: 24.Mar.2016:\n________________________\n\nPlaying the Game again in Alpha 8, I was quite surprised.\nThe Mission and Loyalty System are working VERY well in my opinion and helping out a specific faction rewards you with them having more shops open, etc.\n\nSadly this fun is blocked by some gamebreaking bugs:\n-I have a lot of performance issues. The game lags from the start and it is sometimes worse when jumping to another Nav-Node.\n-Sometimes a Nav-Node is "empty". Like a whole station is missing. The worst that happened to me is when a ship which I had to destroy didn't load into the map.\n-Healing the captain on a bed is not possible. This can be quite an issue if you have nobody who is capable to heal others.\n-Some basic and critical resources like food and scraps ain't available at a store. This can give you quite some trouble.\n\nIn general, I am SERIOUSLY happy how hard Warballoon is working on this game and I am certain, in the next months, this game will be even more playable than 5 months ago. (See above for the other reviews)\nI still cannot recommend it from the view of somebody who wants to have a good time, since the game is in a condition where a lot of bugs hinder one to enjoy the game for a longer period. The game is also missing a lot of features, shortening the fun you might have with it even more.\nOf course, if you want to support the Devs and this Project, nobody is hindering you to buy it!","September 29, 2015","false","3.9"," 28 of 36 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","28","36","0","16"

You run missions for various factions in the galaxy, from establishing trade routes to destroying other space ships (in the most glorious manner might I add) while hiring new crew, upgrading your systems, and buying new ship models.  At the present, the game is a little incomplete, but the developers are hard at work at adding content and polishing bugs, and most importantly, listening to the community. Even so, you can still get several hours of enjoyment out of it as of now before you start feeling the "early access".\n\nOnce finished, Star Command Galaxies will become a fine spaceship sim that throws the player into a spontenous and ever changing universe full of mystery and adventure. It is extremely moddable and could very well turn into next FTL-like hit in its genre if the developers keep up their great work.","February 28","true","9.6"," 27 of 39 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","27","39","0","1"

At it's current stage it is hard to play for very long due to bugs. However the Dev's are working on this game constantly, and are taking all the feedback, bug reports, and suggestions that are brought to them. Currently if you are to buy the game you will find a good game, with fun gameplay, that simply can't be played because of the bugs. The next update, according to Warballoon, will be A LOT of bug fixes. That means you will find a good game, with fun gameplay, and very few bugs. If you have read a comment somewhere that suggests the Dev's aren't working or involved in the game very much I would challenge you to look at the comments on the store page, or the discussions on the game forums on steam. Warballoon has responded to everything, and is actively involved in making the game the best it can be with the help of it's community. They are very much involved, I highly suggest the game not because its fun to play currently (because right now it is hard to play) but because I know it will be fun to play.","January 10","true","19.0"," 18 of 26 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","18","26","0","2"

Again it is in early access but the fact that the developer is constantly working on it is a very good sign!\n\nGetting a little tired of the people who seem to want a perfect version right now.\n\nEdit: Full Early Access Review:\n\nSynopsis: This game is a bit of a cross between FTL, XCom(take your pick), and Space Base DS9. Your a space captain trying to explore the universe, gain reputation, and generally go full James T. Kirk on the galaxy ("We come in peace. Shoot to kill!"). Unlike FTL though there is no real "rush" other than some missions are timed.\n\nPro's:\n1) Crew that levels up.\n2) Customizable ships (currently only the interior, eventually the entire layout, I believe)\n3) Bright, fun pixel art! I am getting a little tired of pixel art at this point, but art style is subjective so I'll give this a pro.\n4) The Developers are constantly working on this and give feedback in these very forums often.\n5) The Developers know about all the cons below and are working on them as I type this.\n\nCons:\n1) It's buggy as heck (Early Access is Early Access)\n2) The AI is currently set to suicidal manic depressive with lethargy and a tendancy to procrastinate. This includes your crew. Especially your crew.\n3) Unless your really familiar with these types of games you will be more than a little lost after the first very brief tutorial.\n4) They have disabled a lot of features (or have yet to activate them) currently. It's a litte frustrating not being able to buy basic stuff you need like beds and food.\n5) The website for Star Command Galaxies hasn't been updated since October and is missing a LOT of information it use to have like the future progression of your crew and what planets will eventually look like.\n\nRemember: This game is a kickstarter that has entered Early Access, a lot of people on Steam seem to want feature complete games the moment they hit the Store. Take this into consideration when reading the downvote reviews, you will see many of them have some rather high expectations for EA games. This is a fun little game even in it's current condition and I would give it a buy especially at it's current price and remember --\n\n"We come in peace.

They are a fraud, and have already stolen over $150,000 through a pair of Kickstarter campaigns, and are now seeking to scam steam users out of their money as well.\n\nFirst, they wanted to make the game for IOS and presumably ANDROID.\nHere is that Kickstarter: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/starcommand/star-command-sci-fi-meets-gamedev-story-for-ios-an?ref=users\nit raised about $35,000\n\nHere is the link to the SECOND kickstarter that they had for this game, way back in 2012. This was very obviously and readable in both the URL and on the page, for a PC AND MAC version.\nHere is that link: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/starcommand/star-command-kickstart-part-2-the-pc-mac-space-adv\nIt raised $150,000.\n\nAs you can see, the expected delivery date for the product tier  for the PC/MAC Kickstarter with nothing but the game in it was AUGUST 2012. thats over 3 years ago. So, wheres the PC/MAC game? Where did the $150,000 for a PC/MAC game go?\n\nThey took the money they raised by claiming they were making a pc/mac game version, $150,000, and basically stole it to use for the IOS and ANDROID game.\n\nThat's the same game that the first Kickstarter was for, that earned only $35,000. So, they used the $150,000 from their second Kickstarter to cover their asses with the mobile market and produce those games.\n\nAnd then used the income gained from the mobile sales for their newly started business and personal expenses.\n\nNow, they have to produce something to give the people from the SECOND Kickstarter, the game they were supposed to make using the $150,000. But since they used it for something else, now they need even more money.\n\nThey want to take your Early Access dollars and use them to cover their own asses on the second Kickstarter. This "alpha" has supposedly been in production since 2012, and still looks like little more than a prototype.\n\nDO NOT SUPPORT THIS DEV\n\nThey are dishonest people, and cannot be trusted to do anything except take your money, and maybe threaten you with physical violence over social media if you call them out on being thieves.\n\n\n\nAlso, their game sucks.","September 23, 2015","false","0.3"," 24 of 40 people (60%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","60","24","40","4","8"

I was hoping to see a mostly finished experience by now. Hopefully they can get it there by the end of the year. This latest patch is finally playable with much fewer bugs than earlier alphas, but planets and SCIENCE are still not available. and it may be a decent game in the future. Right now it's pretty shallow on gameplay IMHO even though there are a couple new aspects besides combat, such as loyalty and missions, that are supposed to be add some depth to the game, but they still need to bake in the oven longer.\n\nI obviously haven't played 6 much yet since it just came out, but I've played Alpha 1-5 downloaded from sendowl. I'll continue to test out each whole alpha going forward and hopefully we'll all see continued major progress. Until then I cannot recommend this game, even as an early access.

I love the idea behind this game, in a lot of ways it's the game I've been dreaming of. I've been following its progress for a few years now (I owned and enjoyed the mobile version when it first came out). I saw the bad reviews and warnings about the bugs and crashes but I couldn't wait any longer. I told myself that at the very least I'd be helping the developers by giving them money during the early access stage.\n\nI like these developers. Like I said I've been frequenting their facebook, twitter and blog updates regularly for ages and during that time I've seen them deal with a lot of negative and sometimes needlessly abusive comments. They've been accused of scamming people and lying and generally being horrible but I couldn't dissagree more with any of that, they've always seemed to try and communicate as best they can and are a genuinely funny bunch of guys.\n\nHOWEVER. Yes unfortunately there is a however... However the game is a freaking hot mess. Not just the bugs, everything; the UI, the design, the logistics it's all kind of off. The mobile version had a simple charm that could have been expanded upon but this recreation seems overly compilcated and at times ugly (which is sad to say because the pixel art is beautiful, just not all clumped together the way it is).\n\nNow, I know what people are going to say, it's early access. Yeah, ok sure but this has been in the making for years  now guys. I know it takes years to make a game but it's already been a long time and frankly at this stage in the game I was hoping for more. I don't doubt their commitment or integrity but I do have very serious doubts that they'll ever really pull it off. I mean, I have a very genuine fear that these guys are going to run out of cash before they finish the game y'know.\n\nI hope that one day soon I will have to eat my own words.

The game is very unstable and buggy in the current state. Buy this early access only if you are sure you dont mind bugs and glitches.\n\nThat fact aside, this game has a lot of charm and smart gameplay decisions. The graphics and animations are fantastic, like watching a scifi cartoon. The gameplay revolves around exploring a proceduraly generated galaxy in your ship which you can upgrade, modify or buy a new one. You also manage cew, their mood, hunger and skills... This game is basically made for people that want a true Star Trek game... there are even diplomatic non violent missions, although you can do whatever you want and the approach is yours how you handle various tasks and missions the game throws at you.\n\nI have been following the game since the kickstarter and the developers are some of the nicest out there.

I played the default for 3 hours trying to figure out the content before realizing this.\n\nI was a big fan of Star Command on Android, and this game looks like a fantastic sequel to that, but it's not quite playable yet.  I've had difficulty with playing due to some bugs and general UI being a little laggy (probably due to using a lot of memory), but I can see a lot of fun stuff that I'd like to get to when everything is stable.

Now, this game is working a lot better and It's possible to glimpse the amazing game that it will be upon completion. Please bear in mind this is an early access game, so if you're expecting a game that's weeks away from completion then please just be patient. Don't completely pass this one up though, even if you just stick it in your wishlist and come back to see how it's progressed in a few months time, I think you will be impressed.\n\nDespite the fact it's not complete though, It really is shaping up to be an amazing game which I personlly enjoy more than FTL and will most likely sink many many more hours into when It is finished. If you've read this far and this still sounds like a game you are willing to try now, despite the early nature of it, then by all means, give it a go!","September 19, 2015","true","1.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","13"

So far the game has add mutipule ships with ranking system for you and your crew.  In the game I've seen several races, mostly coming from the previous game (star command).  The devs did have planets in Alpha 2 or 3 but had to remove for now.  From what I can tell they are going to add several biome planets like forest, lava, ice, ocean, and all of them being able to built on and explore.  The game devs also wish to add SCIENCE which is like customising everything from charaters to the ships to the objects.

Nothing works as intended. It seems that the developers are out to grab some quick cash and don't really know how to program for the pc.  They promise a good game but I don't see it being delivered. Save games don't work. Combat is a joke. Crew members run around aimlessly and need constant attention for some idiotic game play mechanic that requires you to keep them happy every minute.

Still doesn't really work.  There are problems with trying to use different screen resolutions, mouse control is a bit buggy, out of 3 attempts to teleport, I had two game lock ups and had to exit to desktop.  If you pause the game, you can not give orders to your crew. Trying to talk to someone on a space station is frustrating, as they rarely stop moving and with the mouse lag you really can't right click on them while moving.

You start off in the tutorial where you learn how to control the members of your crew (You, and a randomly generated person) and your spaceship. It’s very easy to learn and before you know it you’ll be traveling to another sector at warp speed where you can pick up your first quest! When looking for the destination of your quest on the map you’ll notice that after every different sector you travel to more destinations will pop up, and in each sector there is something different (i.e. vendors, enemies, neutral aliens). I’ve also discovered a nebula which was pretty cool! but bad for the ship because it blocked out one function in my ship. Nebulas can stop one function in your ship which can range from your shield to your weapon, it’s a good thing to know! There are variables in the game that relate to your crew such as sleeping, eating, personality, and personal loyalty. A plus side that I’ve noticed to these variables is that when your crew member is hungry they will cook something and when they’re tired they’ll sleep so that saves you a lot of repetitive clicking! When you encounter different factions in different sectors and complete there mission you build personal loyalty and faction loyalty same goes for your crew member, minus the faction loyalty. I feel like I’ve begun to scratch the surface with this game as there is a lot more to discover, overall I love being a captain of my own spaceship and discovering new places and would recommend this game to anyone.

When you try to do that a message pops up telling you how to rotate it, but the reactor disappears from the screen, and you can no longer control the game.  You have to kill the process.

The game has a number of bugs (which is to be expected given it is in early access) but despite these bugs, the game is still playable. There is not a huge amount to do at this stage, but the framework for the game is coming along and it shows a lot of potential. Also, after spending more time than I would like to admit following the game's progress on social media etc I can say that the developers are constantly in contact with the community, and they are very clear about what their goals are, both short and long-term. It has been made very clear that this game is far from complete, and I can't imagine how frustrating it must be for the developers to see how many people have criticised it due to bugs/being unfinished. Even in it's current state (alpha 8.22) it can still provide a few hours of fun if you try out all the current features. In conclusion: try it if you want to support the game's development but if you want the full experience maybe hold off for a while.","April 28","true","12.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

You still cant update or add things to your ship and that does have a few issues.  You set up new trade but so far all you can trade is missels and would be better to buy stuff for your ship like food and extras beds.  I do hope that they do improve on all that.  It seems to be in the early stages and have alot of bugs to work.  But so far i do like it and do encourge others to buy.

What I missed from FTL was more interaction and depth in the setting - we get a lot more here.

In all this while this game is still early access I am confident that the end product will be worth it and the dev team are really responsive.\n\nIf this game fulfils the players and the developers ambition this could end up being one of the best Indy games available on Steam.   I also expect that knowing the generosity of them there may be some additional extras for those who take part in early stages of the games release.\nPlus it’s a Star Command game.","September 20, 2015","true","6.0"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","7"

The annoying one was one or two times when the jump animation (lights) wouldnt end after jump ended. The first game breaking one is the already commented upon placing item/resource bug where you cant get out of the place function and have to alt-f4\nThe second game breaking bug i just encountered when going to center of the universe from that asteroid belt below the top antarian space station, it didnt warp me to the center of universe, instead it opened a rift into a realm of complete darkness that i couldnt escape.

Their first game was never finished even though they said they would and they seem to be following the same trend here. I helped support their kickstart before steam and they promised at least monthly status updates (which was to hard for them to keep up with) and they gave us even more false hope about frequent updates when they got to steam. Now they have come up with another reason that they can neglect their comminity of floowers with some lame excuse of trying to push the game ahead in production because of getting a backer for the game. That is still no reason to neglect your game updates or even just a monthly update. Game is terribly buggy and un playable for being in deveolpment for as long as they have been. I and much of the community are losing faith that this development team will produce at all. Even though they dropped the ball on their promises on their first game, they had the gall to ask us to trust them again with this one and they are fumbling all over the place yet again.
