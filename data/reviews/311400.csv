Anyway played it on my main gaming PC.\nNot many graphics options to tweak in the menu so onto the game.\nThe open world part is poor, nothing to do except walk around getting into different cars.\nAnyway I gave it another chance and decided to try the racing competition mode. 4 cars racing around a city track following the arrows to help guide your way..or so I thought. The arrows was sending me round in a circle, one minute I was in first place well clear of the other cars the next minute I was in last place half of a lap behind! The problem was the course used the same parts of the track twice so the arrows was sending me in the wrong direction. Resetting the car didnt help, all this seems to do is position you next to the nearest arrow which can be from an earlier part of the track. and don't get me onto the handling of the cars or the collision mechanics of this game..awful. Also it seems the devs have mostly left this game unfinished. Just avoid it","July 19, 2015","false","1.0"," 59 of 78 people (76%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","76","59","78","9","0"

What I found was probably one of the most credible successors for Big Rigs. There is no car damage, you can pop off some lamp posts and that's it. Only things happening when you crash are either flying around, spinning or knocking back like crazy with no real penalty. Calling controls arcade-like would be extremely generous, but they are just stiff and cars don't really turn around like you want to. Music is kinda good but most of the time its so upbeat it only adds to comedy value of the game.\n\nThere are three main modes to speak of. Time trial is what it is, if you are masochistic enough to master controls of this game. Race mode has some CPU opponents you can push around like they have zero weight. There is no multiplayer. Lastly there is free roam where you can explore the map which takes 10 minutes tops, run through pedestrians and use handful cars available to you. There's many kinds of cars parked but you can't use most of them. You also have a jump that doesn't seem to have any purpose other than fooling you to think you can get over some fences and stuff. Nope. Most fun thing I found was driving on the ocean floor. Yeah.\n\nIt is sad to see some effort definitely went into this. All in vain. Also worth mentioning is that the engine is very heavy considering what the game looks like. You can tweak it up a little since its straight up Unreal 3. Or should I say you can try. I even ran out of video memory which is legendary. I didn't find a way to rebind controls. I tried because I didn't like the preset.\n\nTo sum it all up: don't buy this game if you want a good racing game. If you want to cry or laugh, I think you should actually buy this! It is very cheap and can make you laugh if you are one of those into bad games. Definitely has also educational value for game developers everywhere.","December 1, 2014","false","0.9"," 68 of 93 people (73%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","73","68","93","7","0"

Throughout the  HOUR of gameplay I put into this game, I fell through the map a total of 6 times. I dont know if this game is abandon-ware left by the developer, or whether it's being worked on for it's faults.\n\nPro's: The game has a vast majority of cars for you too use in the game.\nThe driveable car's physics are decent at most.\n\nANNNNDD NOW THE CON'S  there's a lot of them\n\nCon's: The graphics for this game are awful, really poor and shameful to look at.\n\nThis game feels like a really crappy mobile port too pc, since there are no graphical options whatsoever. {except for resolution etc.}\n\nThe physics for the  NON DRIVEABLE CARS  are laughable, absolutely terrible.\n\nThere is this motion blur that is really annoying that you can't turn off, and even if you move in the slightest, it'll show up and be annoying.\n\nThe car's are basically all the same, they just have different looks, but they all accelerate the same, go the same speeds, and some even have the same present sounds for their engine.\n\nThe A.I. for the races are absolutely terrible, they drive into walls, and can't steer straight through the track.\n\nCharacter Modeling for this game is almost Nonexistent because of the same NPC's that walk the street. there are a total of like, 4-5 different NPC's. who are very low res, who for some reason stand at 7 feet tall, (taller than your character, when you leave the car)\n\nTHE GAME IS VERY UNPOLISHED. In free-roam, you can drive around in an open world, the map is very small, and kind of linear when you think about it. there are invisible walls, almost everywhere, and sometimes even floors that you can fall through the world with. I've actually fell off the side of the map, Literally walked too the end, and jumped off.\n\nThe Free-Roam map is also unfinished, with a bridge that has a construction site on it, too even parts of the map that you can see in the distance with no ground. this map is full of surprises.\n\nWould I recommend this game? NO. It is an Unpolished, Unfinished product of an open world racing game for lowend pc's that doesn't even run well. if you want a good open world racing game, your best bets are Need For Speed, or even Forza Horizon.\n\n3/10 Because I slightly enjoyed uninstalling it.","October 13, 2015","false","1.9"," 37 of 49 people (76%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","76","37","49","8","0"

Are you down with Ocean City? Are you for real? Really real? Really really...really....really real REAL? Then maybe you should play this game.\n\nIt's illegal street racing at its finest as you get behind the wheel of the sexiest imports. We're talking borsches, hamborghinis, ataris, and go-karts. Each of the 10 races features chills, spills, and speeds that'll leave you wearing adult diapers.\n\nYou wanna know how extreme it can get? Some of these courses are designed so that racers will get in head-on collisions! Can you believe that? I certainly can't, and I just experienced it firsthand. The races are twisted because everyone, is you, and you, are everybody. Is that deep or what? It's like you've just had this psychotic breakdown and now you're racing cars with your selves. Even if you can't grasp the handling, don't worry, because your competitors are worse drivers than you are.\n\nOcean City is bad news. I mean yeah it looks alright, but the people are just...wow. I mean I'm just a generic guy with a goatee and cold dead eyes, but at least I don't look like Odo from Deep Space 9. It's like whoever modeled this game thought "we don't need pedestrians that resemble humans, but we have to make sure they're wearing meme t-shirts. That is the most important thing." Either that, or everyone was too focusing on delivering the ultimate racing experience. I'm guessing it was the latter.\n\n....\n....Alright I've had enough fun.\n\nTruth is, this isn't a good racing game. It's definitely incomplete, should probably spend several months in the oven, and level 3 needs far more than just its graphics tightened up. I had fun with it though, more fun than I've had with numerous polished videogames. I'm a big fan of open-world driving games like Burnout Paradise, Test Drive Unlimited, and the Crash Time games. Simply being able to goof off and get stupid with expensive-looking automobiles is perpetual entertainment to me.\n\nI'm actually worried that eventually the developers of this game will fix it. It'll be complete, well-designed, and yet, something will be lost. I like making all the weird discoveries, such as finding the burger king ads, pedestrians more disturbing and with creepier animations than the last, and new ways to flip my car. Eventually all that might get taken away, and I'll be sad.\n\nNot a good game, but it's fun, and that's all that matters?","December 21, 2014","true","1.9"," 69 of 108 people (64%) found this review helpful 50 people found this review funny","64","69","108","50","1"

Read on if you so desire.\n\nThis game features one of the worst handling and physics I've ever experienced. Of course this is something that's not comfortable on my part and might be something good for someone else, but judging the major dislikes on this game, I don't think I need to feel alone.\n\nThey've inserted 'easter eggs' for you to find, when in reality the only real easter eggs are the bugs and glitches that come out of the game and oh boy are there a TON of bugs and glitches.. oh wait did I say easter eggs? They aren't a secret at all..\n\nThe optimisation for this game is beyond terrible.. oh and when you rely on memes from around 2010 to hide the game's flaws, you're absolutely being preposterous. Come the hell on, we're at the end of 2014 here. I may have never liked these 'memes' in the first place, but even now these things are as dead as a dead horse who's already vanished due to it's rotting process. (And yes, you can not run them over. Some clip through your car like ghosts, and some are as hard as titanium, they don't budge at all.)\n\nI've got this game for the full price. Even these 3 euro's were too much for something like this. With the money I'd rather buy Bad Rats.\n\nI hope this extra additional info helps out on improving insight, but I'm never touching this game again. but I might give it another shot if they improve the handling and physics, fix the horrendous flaws in the game, expand the land and start basing their comedy on something that's actually fitting in the recent gaming communities.

Whenever you crash into other cars or buildings you car stays intact. You could destroy things like small fences but whenever you ride into a pedestrian your car just stops. I know this is no carmageddon but perhaps there should not have been npc's in a game like this. The cars also have some unnatural physics. It would have been nice if you could play the game with a controller but mine did not seem to work.\n\nThere are 3 game modes: Time-Trial, Race Mode and Free Roam. Obviously, Time-Trial is to beat your own times, Race-Mode is just racing opponents and Free-roam is driving around an 'open world' city.\n\nThe graphics are not that special these days but they are not that bad. The city looks OK but I doubt anyone plays this game for sight-seeing.\nAlthough not my taste, the music is pretty good however, totally not suited for a race game, in my opinion.\n\nWithout any achievements, online leaderboards or online/offline multiplayer, the game will most likely bore you after max 1 hour. Even though the game is cheap, I still can't recommend this one.\n\n","May 16, 2015","false","0.2"," 26 of 37 people (70%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","70","26","37","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zerathos/recommended/311400/","zerathos","Locke","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zerathos/","1102 products in account","Oh boy. I just keep finding ways to get impressed. At a retail price of $3, Ocean City Racing (well, OCEAN CITY RACING, but I think you'll forgive me if drop the caps) is a pretty cheap buy, but as a lover of racing games I'll give almost anything a try. It doesn't always go well, like Redneck Racing or Motorama, and Ocean City Racing is stacking up to be another mistake languishing in my library.\n\nThe game already fails on a technical level with a barebones options menu, offering an extremely limited resolution choice—not even offering my native resolution of 1600x900, the third most common resolution by Steam's hardware survey—no graphics options, no volume sliders, no rebindable controls...it's just a mess. And the game runs terribly and looks worse, with a massively overdone motion blur to boot that makes it more or less impossible to see what you're doing. Of course, as mentioned, there is no way to turn this off. Additionally, all the button prompts given are for keyboard controls, so anyone who wants to play with a controller will find themselves randomly pressing buttons to try to figure things out if they didn't memorize the controls from the options menu.\n\nThe car handling is utter garbage. You have very little control and will find yourself bumping off walls left and right. Conveniently there's a reset car button that doesn't seem to have much penalty, so I think this was expected. The handbrake button has been replaced by a spin out button, leading to further resets. The boost fails to give any real feeling of speed, but nonetheless makes the car all the more likely to go out of control in corners, adding yet more usefulness to the reset button unless you save it for straights. And of course there's the random physics bugs where a tap against a wall can send you flying into the air. And despite all this bumping around and lost time, the computers have it even worse; I watched them crash on their own all over the place. They don't know how to play this game any better than I do! I had an atrocious time but still somehow came in second in my first race.\n\nSo, after the disaster of a race, I decided I would try free roam mode. You walk around in a first-person camera and can't interact with anything but the cars. You drive around a little more freely which leads to a little bit less bumping around, but the driving still feels terrible, the game still looks like someone dumped Vaseline on it, you still randomly get launched into the air, and there doesn't seem to really be any point to doing any of this.\n\nIt was at this point I realized I had about all I could take of this game and decided to try collecting my thoughts together into words. That really is all there is to it: nothing in this game inspires me to play it, and on both technical and design fronts it actively discourages me from playing. There was not one moment when playing this game that I thought to myself "I had fun," and for that I cannot recommend this game for any reason.","May 31, 2015","false","0.3"," 20 of 27 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","20","27","2","0"

Characters sit it blocky postures like robots. Steering wheel doesn't even turn. No smoke effects when braking, Lack of cars and variation. All cars go the same speed and sound identical.  Maps all small and minimum effort has been put into them. I bought this game thinking I got a bargain I mean 3 dollars! Thats amazing -_- NOPE! Chuck testa. This game is absolute ♥♥♥♥ and for the tiny amount of content you get its worth arounnd 70 cents, MAXIMUM. Free roam is a piece of ♥♥♥♥, you can't even access half the cars. When you drive into pedestrians they all of a sudden turn into ghosts. Every building seems to lack an entrance.\n\nDon't even get me started on Race Mode. The drivers are dopy and constantly crash into things (Which you would expect on super easy difficulty. OH WAIT THERE AREN'T EVEN DIFFICULTY LEVELS.) Maps are the same race track over and over just repainted. No story at all. I mean at all! Not even a name of the racer, you just get plopped onto a road and have to try and drive in circles while a bunch of idiots crash into eatchother behind you.   No backstory, what country you are in, why your there, how you got there. Because you can magically teleport.\n\nFree roam is just so bad I have to complain twice. Other than a couple of ramps randomly put around the 7 meter long map there is no interaction at all. About 3 npc models.  Animations are messed up so people just wave sit down then stand up and wave then sit down again.  No voice recordings. Every person in Ocean City  is mute and deaf. Oblivious to everything npcs just sit there, or should I say stand there waving and staring in the void.  You can jump! But you can't jump over anything because the characters feet are made of cement and he can only just lift his feet off the ground. Everything is badly designed and blurry. There is no end to race mode. You just do the same race over and over in a different coloured car.\n\n-23/10 ~IGN "Great game, would bang again."","November 23, 2014","false","0.8"," 35 of 62 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","35","62","2","0"

This was the perfect opportunity for a trip to bright and bold Ocean City. Spent some time in free roaming mode and had a blast. Strange people and pale neon colours, bright skies and bizarre NPCs/citizens. The controls were fine for controlling my car and character, I didn't  really pursue any "proper" races. I just wanted to look at everything, every shopwindow, because it all seemed handcrafted.\nBut. It was over all too quickly. A bridge under construction stopped me unexpectedly. The supposedly huge game world simply ended.\nI want more. More people that gesticulate wildly or stare at things.

But I've had a lot of fun with this game, it just comes down to what you're actually looking for. Want a serious racing sim? Look further. Are you searching for some (although buggy) old-fashioned fun? You might want to stick around. My recommendation however: buy it in the sales, you'll probably be better off that way.\n\n(WARNING: long review ahead, proceed with caution)\n\nGeneral thoughts\nI've followed this game since it's early days on IndieDB, I've been looking forward to it's release on Steam. Now one small, quick (but important) note: the game description is too positive. "Features the biggest, most detailed and alive open world city". This is not true. Yes, it's a decently sized city, but nothing more. Let's compare the size of the map with the size of the map of GTA V. You know that airport at the bottom of LS? Yeah, it's about that big. It's a bit more spreaded, but surface-wise, about the size of the airport. Probably even smaller, since a big portion of the map is occupied by buildings and inaccessible parking lots. Yes, it has an Underground Tube station... Sort of... It's about 50-70 metres long, and you can't go on the traintracks or on the train. Yeah, kind of dissapointing. Furthermore, the cars differ in quality, some are plain old models that are, if I'm not mistaken. taken straight from UDK. Others seem like rather crappy, low-poly models that have a bunch of modelling and texture bugs. What about the livelyness of the city? Well, maybe as lively as a town full of zombies. There are about 5 models for pedestrians, all wearing meme-shirts. You can drive straight through them, no interaction at all. They don't fall over, jump out of the way, you can't even push them around. Then what about traffic? The traffic consists of a bunch of cars (with even lower resolution!) that seem to be on Scalextric tracks. You can push 'em around all you want, but the front wheels will always point to the direction they're going, That doesn't mean they're completely inanemate, you can cause massive pileups, send them flying and make them go all sixes and sevens.\n\nNow let's talk about gameplay, shall we?\nThe handling, let's just get on with it straight away. Ehmm, boring and obvious is the only way I can describe it. It certainly doesn't have ground-breaking physics that would put  Raceroom Racing Experience  to shame. It's rather bland, unoriginal, almost as if the developer had just taken a default code for the driving physics. Which is probably what actually happened. Is that a particularly bad thing? No, most definitely not. As a manner of fact, I'd rather have someone just take a premade string of code, rather than creating their own code from scratch and messing up.\n\nRaces\nThis game comes with a few racemodes. Time-trial and checkpoint races. It's pretty straight forward, timetrial, you drive on your own, through one of the few courses. Finish before the timer runs out, you win. When the timer runs out and you haven't yet finished, you lose. Checkpoint races: you drive around a course with other opponents. Finish first and you'll win, and you know the rest.\n\nBugs\nThis game is riddled with bugs, so many in fact, it's somtimes a guilty pleasure to just play a game of 'How to break a game in as many ways as possible'. Just take this example: When you go over the bridge away from the city, you'll arrive at a teeny tiny, almost roundabout-sized island. in the middle: a bunch of rocks. Hit those rocks at high speeds, you'll jump, do massive flips with an incredible amount of air-time, and with a bit of luck, you might just land on the next bridge. It is however, way more likely you'll miss the bridge, and land in the water. Big problem? Not really. Underneath the surface of the water, or I could just say texture of a surface, there is a bonedry, hard floor. And now you can endlessly drive around in the water. But watch out, if you manage to find the edge of the map, you'll fall down into oblivion. And don't expect the reset-button to help there. When your car resets back onto the road you are closest to, the car will just freeze. You're able to bump into it with other cars, and it'll move, but you can't drive it. And once you're out of it, you can't get back in.\nJust a small example of a bug.\n\nFinal verdict:\nAlright, that was a long, long review. Buy my final verdict is... 6/10.\nSurprised? I bet you are. This game is horribly made, I completely agree, but for the fun-factor, I'll give it a 9/10, probably. Yes, there are bugs, yes it's a short game, small map, done playing in probably two hours. But for me, it was a fun experience. It's still a fun game. But do beware: buy it when it's in the sales, when it costs next to nothing, because I sitll do not think it is worth that much money.\nAnd if you enjoy bug-hunting, this is fun as well.\n\nAll jokes aside, buy it at your own risk, read the reviews, look at the trailers, maybe look up some gameplay footage on YouTube, whatever you do, take a deep thought. I had a lot of fun, but if you're after a serious racing game, look further.\nRaceroom Racing Experience  is a good place to start.","November 25, 2015","true","23.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I went with positive based on the low price of $2.99.\n\nThe biggest problem isn't really with the game, but with the store pages.\nIt contains some "enhanced truths" that I'd like to correct here.\n\n\n'massive environment'\nI'd say medium environment. There is a lot of variety to the city but it is, by no means, massive.\n\n'most advanced driving physics ever seen in an indie game'\nMore arcade feeling than simulator. This is fine for me as I prefer arcade. But I've seen a few goofy things that isn't realistically possible.\n\n'unlock new vehicles as they progress'\nYou don't get to pick what vehicle you drive in a race. Every stage in both race mode and time trials, your car is pre-selected. Every race you get assigned a different car. You can't modify the color or any parts for the car. Hardly what I would call "Unlocking".\n\n'players have the ability to choose one of the many tracks available'\nIn both race mode and time trials, you cannot select a track. The track (like the cars mentioned above) are pre-determined.\n\n\nThose things said, the game is still an 'okay' racing game. If the developer had expanded on this a little more it would probably be a lot better. As it stands, it's a rather small racing game that will probably only keep you entertained for a few hours, at most. The cars are nice and in the free roam mode, you get to drive each one (but can't race them). The environment has a lot of things considering how small it is (beach, tunnel, narrow alley, bridge, small rural area).\n\nOverall it isn't a BAD game, it's just lacking in features.","August 24, 2015","true","5.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/proloser2/recommended/311400/","proloser2","danodude","http://steamcommunity.com/id/proloser2/","76 products in account","First off, do I recommend this game? It's hard to say. I want to give the game a good review for the effort put in, so this is the best I can do.\n\nI'll try to keep the review as quick and concise as possible, so read on :)\n\nWhile the game has a good concept, the actual result needs some work. I like how it is open world, and it has what I wish a lot of open world car games would include - a first person mode, where you can walk around, explore, and hop into other cars you see.\n\nI know GTA allows you to do this, but I don't like the extreme violence in that series, and therefore don't play em.\n\nPhysics wise, the cars behave fine at low speeds but once they are moving, I feel that they are not loose enough on the rear wheels, and thus feel a bit weird (i.e, they don't slide out at the back if cornering hard).\n\nThe game uses the Unreal engine, so the graphical effects are quite nice. However, the quality of the car modles, and overall world detail could use some work. I understand that only a few people made the game, so it's not always possible to go into heavy detail like AAA games have, but still, they could have delayed its release and worked on the models a bit more.\n\nI noticed some graphical shadow bugs when running fullscreen - not sure what was causing that. My computer definitely isn't underpowered, so it's most likely some bug.\n\n\nContent-wise, what you get is appropriate for the price (I think there are around 10 cars). For the most part, I noticed a dfferent suspension setup values for each car. For example, the Camaro looks and feels different to the Mini.\n\nThe world, in my opinion, needs some more stuff to do though. After half an hour of driving, I found myself wanting to either challenge someone or upgrade my car. I know there is a race mode, but in any game, I much rather race real people than AI.\n\n\nAll up, I appreciate the work put into the game, but I honestly have to say that I won't play the game much, because there is nothing to bring me back to it later - which, in my case, is multiplayer.\n\nIt doesn't matter what game I'm playing - if it's single player (especially in the racing genre), sooner or later I'm going to get bored of it. Good example: the very first GRID game in Codemaster's series had multiplayer support pulled - and I haven't played that game in a good 5 (or how many years since the servers were shut down, I can't remember) years since driving against AI is so... boring.\n\n\n\nFinal Conclusion:\n\nIf you have a few bucks to spend, and some time to kill, then maybe you will like it. Like they say, it's the price of a cup of coffee (although I never drink the stuff :P). If you're looking for a multiplayer game with a huge world, high quality models, and lots of content, then no.\n\nAs a side note, young kids will probably enjoy the violence-free open world and ability to walk to and drive different cars.\n\nThe game certainly needs more work to be a polished and fun experience.","March 6","false","0.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","6"

But somethings are unexcusible.\n\nPros:\nGood car models\nSome Locations are done with a proper amount of detail\nGraphics are not half bad\nGood Driving Mechanic (for messing around in free roam)\n\nCons:\nSome textures are just photoshoped pictures that look like they were taken with a 5 dollar camera,\n\nSome textures break licencing agreements, (mainly car brands that were not blurred out enough) (also I don't know if it does break licence, I just know that cheaper games make spinoffs of real items made by brands so they don't get a Copyright infringement notice)\n\nNon-Drivable cars have as many polys as Mario did in Super Mario 64\n\nSome areas have invisible walls that shouldn't be blocked off are, and areas that should be blocked off aren't\n\nSome models are broken and seem like they are stock with the engine, (Mostly the hummers, with the spare tire sitting on the front grill, blocking half the windshield.\n\nCONCLUSION: I can't judge this game too hardly, I got it for 74 cents and I don't know if I'd pay $3 for this, (but thats the same for most games)\n\nSo this game scores a Solid 6.9/10\n","June 11, 2015","true","0.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Also I've liked the game due have great quantity of cars with nice details,  his cycle of  day/night was pretty real and decent graphics with unreal engine system soft . Also remind me to GTA with varied cities and where you can run over pedestrians.

Try the racing mode. Once you get the hang of it it's very enjoyable to the extent of being therapeutical. The physics adds a lot to the enjoyment. It's so easy to spin the AI cars around by ramming into them, and they ram into you as well. It is actually quite funny.\n\nThat being said, it's a casual racer with pretty graphics by the Unreal Engine 3. Getting first place shouldn't be too difficult if you actually try to win.\n\nThe free roam mode adds some quality mindless exploration.\n\nSome other reviews say this game is great for kids, and I agree. But that doesn't mean it's meant only for them.\nPeople tend to expect too much from games it seems.\n\nUnique physics, unreal graphics and good opponent AI, what more could you ask for?\n\nThe soundtrack is actually quite relaxing, and a change from the usual stuff I listen to.\n\nOverall this game is a good escape.

I tried crossing the bridge but there was a big "not constructed yet" sign at the end and I fell in the ocean.

It has really good functionality and also has incredible potential. With a little more time put into it, I'm sure it could have made the new Midtown Madness. Back in those days everyone wanted the ability to get out of the car and walk around, without having features of GTA where you'd beat up people and junk.

It's just too rough to be recommendable. With a bit more work the game could be better but at least it's dirt cheap.\n\nGraphics are not too bad, even though quite disappointing for an Unreal Engine 3 game. The models are very low quality, texture work is from the 90s, shaders are very simple and there are many, many bugs (such as the shadows being projected "upwards" on some locations). But some areas are not too bad looking and the lightning can look really good (notably at night).\nSounds are pretty bad. The engine sound curve seems tied to the speed of the car, which causes sound glitches when cornering: the engine alternates between two "gears" and sounds really bad.\nComplete lack of actual video settings, and absolutely no audio settings.\n\nRace mode and Time trial mode can be done in a couple of hours, if you manage to never miss checkpoints. As the game doesn't show you anything to tell you the checkpoint is validated, you may end up losing 10 minutes of racing because a checkpoint wasn't validated. It's a bit frustrating but something that, I reckon, could be fixed in minutes if the developer decided to go a bit further with the game. The AI is incredibly basic and slow and won't hesitate to run into you or another opponent. It's not uncommon to lap one or more AI cars on some of the longer races. Free roaming is empty and a bit boring (also, 60 FOV is quite tight). Not a very challenging game.\n\nDriving physics are acceptable for an arcade game, though a bit understeery, but the gameplay is let down by the way the collisions are handled. Overall quite pleasant as long as you keep away from touching anything.\n\nNeeds more work to be good.","February 27, 2015","false","3.1"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ejbspeed/recommended/311400/","ejbspeed","Pywackett-Barchetta","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ejbspeed/","340 products in account","I noticed this game in my backlog and figured I'd give it a go. I love driving aimlessly in an open world! So I start it up and it sorta chugs through the loading screen, on this rather powerful gaming PC. So I check the graphics options and... there's really just resolution. Now, I've used the Unreal Engine before, there are PLENTY of options built in that could be easily listed there, but okay, I turn down the resolution and try the free roaming.\n\nI start on-foot, walking to the nearest car. Quite slowly, but a neat touch, at least, and I can jump slightly. Get in, start driving around. Hit a pedestrian, and... they stand stock-still while my car thuds to a stop like it hit a brick wall. Okay, then. Drive away, go to head to the bridge in the distance. Try to drift, brakes make steering no longer a thing. Okay, then. Try to drift with the e-brake, practically instant stop. Okay, then. Bump into the car in front of me and it cartoonishly soars over my hood. That's pretty neat, actually! Probably not right, but very entertaining. Hit the next car, thud to a stop. Bump into a guard rail, thud to a stop. Hit some chairs, they go flying, hit the table the chairs were at, thud to a stop. So that's weirdly inconsistent, but okay, don't hit things. Got a bit lost trying to get up to the bridge, finally find a looping ramp up to it, get on, drive over and head to a small island. I can see another city in the distance... but driving to there magically pops in construction barriers. Oh, okay, I guess this game is in Early Access and they're still making the map! That explains a lot of the rough edges, that's fine.\n\nI go back and drive around a bit, this time on an ATV, and awkwardly teeter around on it, my driver bizarrely superglued to the handlebars. Still neat to be able to drive around the smaller alleyways and such. I get off of it and walk into a subway station, fully modeled with a rather plainly textured train going by and posters of odd, stretched resolutions. Eh, that's all fine for Early Access, they'll fix it.\n\nAnd then came the real bad part. It's NOT in Early Access. It's "done", a "complete" product. It needs a TON of work to be anywhere beyond just "tolerable", and if that work isn't being put in... I really can't recommend you play this, let alone pay three bucks for it. Could get a big thing of soda and a Hot Wheels car for less than that price and have more fun.","March 24, 2015","false","0.3"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

Henceforth in like 10 minutes of gameplay, I just coudn't handle the downright frustrating handling of the vehicles.\n\nGREAT MUSIC THO\n\n4/10 Every single pedestrian is Kitty Pryde/ Shadowcat of the X-Men","March 27, 2015","false","0.2"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"
