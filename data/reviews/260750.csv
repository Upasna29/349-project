"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/260750/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","First, let's talk about Steam release.\n\nThis compilation includes the original 2 games of the series. You may seen other games which have numbering from 3 to 7, but those were made by other publishers and aren't exactly official, from what I know. (Most of them are quite ugly and didn't bring any evolution/revolution to the formula of the first game)\n\nThis Steam release is a simple and flat "put game as is". This can be blamed on that new publishers have no access to the source port or other materials. Thus you will not find any trading cards, achievements, widescreen or any optimisation at all, not even Steam Overlay work in this one. On good side, the game should still work on modern computers.\n\nNow the games themselves:\n\nNeighbours From Hell 1 is point'n'click quest in which you control Woody as you make him sneak around the house, avoiding being seen by Mr. Rottweiler, and make traps, which usually involes first collecting an item in the house and then applying them to the object in house. Some traps may lead neighbour to another nasty trap. Oh, and tip-toeing around Neighbour's pets.\n\nBeating the game by getting minium requeirement of traps is quite easy. Beating it by finding and applying every trap in every level is simple as well.\nBut what make the game the real crunchy puzzler is getting 100% rating on each level. To do this you are required not only to make use of every trap, but to make sure that Mr. Rottweiler get in as many of them in a row before he cools off from previous trap, resulting in him breaking down on each new one (with animation of him almost breaking his back). The timing, order of tricks and placement of traps which can be put in any room (items like marbles) to connect faraway traps is everything there, making you actually think and plan there.\n\nThe second game then takes place outside of house on various exotic locations. Sneaking is no more, gone are guardian pets. System of multiple lifes were added, so you aren't immeditly screwed when Neighbour sees you for the first time. And this time your life is made harder by a sudden appearance of mom of out bully, who keeps an eye and fists for you as well. Shame that she mostly spends her time either sleeping or shopping.\n\nThis time around getting the golden statue, which is equalient to what 100% rating was in the first game, is much easier, as Neighbour rage now stores on a meter that can stack "breakdowns" from other tricks and it cools down much slower. So it's a simply matter of making trap ahead of neighbour path non-stop, with no real thinking. Instead the game concentrates more on the figuring out tricks themselves and their activating, with some tricks working as part of "combo". Still, no real puzzle.\n\n\nNow, the games are overall quite fun, with great music which fits to the game goodly and the joyful graphics that use prerendered 3D assets, which are greatly animated. It especially shows with a cartoony characters that the second game is full with. My only complaints would be same repeating breakdown animation for Mr. Rottwell in the first game, which was varied nicely in sequel, and how underplayed neighbour's mom is in Vacations, who could be less passive.\n\nOH, and one of more important things: If you are fan of the slapstick humor (and slightly black one), then I am sure that you will be holding for your belly in this game from laughter.","November 28, 2013","true","24.1"," 108 of 112 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","108","112","2","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Faudraline/recommended/260750/","Faudraline","Faudraline","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Faudraline/","1198 products in account","Neighbours from Hell Compilation is a collection of short adventure/time management games - Neighbours from Hell and Neighbours from Hell 2: On Vacation - developed and produced by JoWooD in 2003-2004. They are the kind of perfectly silly games that you'd try during an initially boring afternoon with a mischievous smirk on the corner of your mouth.\n\nMeet Woody, our main character, who has sworn to make every living moment hell for his despicable neighbor, Mr. Rottweiler in a 2D animated fashion. The whole concept of the game is based on a sitcom: cameras do follow Woody as he sneaks around to play juvenile tricks in ACME quality - like setting a banana peel on a slippery surface, drawing funny faces on family portraits or changing the coffee in your neighbor's pot with compost - on his nasty neighbor and dabble with which actually shouldn't concern him. On that manner, Woody is basically a human version of Bugs Bunny in plastic animations.\n\nThe second instalment of the series is basically same, with some more characters, a different environment and mini games thrown around. This time, Woody follows his neighbor to his vacation spots to show some personal attachment. Is he obsessive, or what? Oh, and Woody has given 3 chances to complete his series of trickeries before his neighbor catches him this time. Graphics are slightly better, yet the main idea is same.\n\nIn each episode of the show, you are given 5-7 minutes to follow your neighbor's pattern for the episode, discover and initiate a series of crude jokes and traps for him to fall for while avoiding getting caught sneaking around. The more you manage to lay the outcome of your tricks in short periods between, the better rating you get for the given episode - so your poor neighbor wouldn't recover from the joke before and lose his temper to display funnier poises.\n\nNeighbours from Hell is a cute, yet not very imaginative game with crass jokes. The concept is interesting, yet it is not particularly funny. Once you complete each episode with 100% rating, - which is real easy if you follow the patterns - there is no replay value at all. Go for it when it's on discount, and either spare a lazy afternoon to try and enjoy it or offer the idea to your kids in case you have any. Do I recommend it? Well, not particularly good but, hey! At least it's kid friendly... if your kid is into ACME humor, that is.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","November 9, 2015","true","3.3"," 49 of 55 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","49","55","3","7"

It's not a long game, it can be completed in a few houres, depending on how fast you learn the pranks in order to get a high audience.

This game it's like if you change to a world in which is 1th April every day.\n\nI remember way back getting into the disc boxes of my father and catch the demo of this gem for the first time. This is a really genuine game that surprised me on my childhood. I remember to play the demo over and over because there was no way to get this game from a retailer near my old home. In this game you play as a charismatic dude that needs to annoy his neighbors in the most humiliating ways possible. It take me a smile every time I hear the old dude screams. The game puts the player in a live-show at the shows of Paul. The star of the show and the one that needs to humiliate his pals on live-cam. It's just hilarious.\n\nThis comedy is worth a try, no matter how old you are, this game will steal a laugh from your soul. Sometimes you need to annoy the old dude by putting soap into his bathroom floor, or maybe a dynamite on his birthday cake. The possibilities are limited, but the combinations are up to the player. It is the same thing always, the old dude gets humiliated, but the way in which the actions are performed is up to the player. Sometimes in bizarre ways, sometimes in really weird ways, but he always gift the player his screams.\n\nThis is a game which you play by point and click objects. You have a scene in 2D and the player needs to search for objects around the area to interact with other objects, and perform an action. This action is to humiliate specific npcs in the game. But generally the old dude is the one that gets all the tragedy. Anyways, the game also allows the player to hide, because if the old dude, or another "rival" npc discover you in-fraganti. He or she pwns you on live cam. There is a score for each level. You get a percentage depending on how bad you humiliated the target. The player also gets a bar in which counts how many times you got the target beyond the line of awkward fury. The old dude gets his back hurt every time the player makes him really mad. Also, the player can combine the actions to make the target in constant madness.\n\nIt is a really hilarious game and it is really fun. It is super old, but still is amazing today. Look at the trailer to see more about this game. It really worth a try.","June 20, 2015","true","1.7"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","17","18","0","0"

A charming point and click game which, also happens to be one of my favorite game genres.\n\nTo start off this review lets take  a look at the concept of this game. You play as Woody, a content young fellow who is terrorized by his dispicable neighbor Mr. Rottweiler. You start to skulk around his house as the star of a T.V show. Your job is to set up traps in his house to terrorize Mr. Rottweiler and enact your revenge. One of the things that I love about this game is the creativity of the traps and the strategy that's behind them. A lot of the traps in this game are clever and took me a while to figure out. Timing also plays a huge role, especially if you want a percentage of over 90% (Like me). It really does keep you on your feet as you have to be aware of Mr. Rottweiler. Also, there are no lives in this game. If you're caught, you have to restart the whole level. While these aspects have drawn me towards loving the game, there are some factors I can't stand. Mainly the immature humor. Now, listen. If done correctly, immature humor can trigger a laugh here and there but, in this game it feels a tad bit forced and monotonous.

The game was Prank TV... sadly, I don't believe that this game still exists.\n\nThe game is a classic casual game about pranks, and not getting caught pranking a really rotten apple of neighbor... Meet Mr. Rottweil (well, I just hope that no poor dog of the same race will be harmed by this game) a bad mooded, rotten and foulmouthed stinker in your neighborhood... He did several very, very bad things - like biting a neighbors dog, and now Wally is in for Revenge...\n\nYou have to study his movement patterns to prank him with the highest rate of efficiency... and see him go balistic, well in pranking I am more the kind of George Hayduke type of pranker - if it doesn't hurt it's not a prank at all... So I am going very sympathetic with... Wally... of course.\n\nThe game should be played as a casual game, and like good wine it should be savoured... don't play all episodes in one  run, it will destroy the experience and you will be missing a lot of those two games - especially the fun. Try to manage 100 % even though it's not required... but then again, it's fun...\n\nThe game has some good 2D artworks, for a low budget game (even as it was created, it was low budget... I still have my original CDs in my archive...) some of the artworks might remind players to a famous comic artist out of north germany, responsible for commercial design of a gas company and... of course his own trademark... which already was theme of five regional very sucessful movies.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/electrichellknight/recommended/260750/","electrichellknight","ElectricHellKnight","http://steamcommunity.com/id/electrichellknight/","95 products in account","I played Neighbours From Hell way back when it first came out on CD-ROM, over ten years ago. I later bought the sequel (also on disc) after it came out. It seems to me like if these games had been first released within the past few years, they would have been more widely known. These sort of games seem like prime "meme material" and the kind of thing that would thrive on the modern internet.\n\nNeighbours From Hell might as well be called "Trolling: The Game". The entire premise of the game(s) revolves around playing pranks on your fat alcoholic neighbour as part of the reality show in which you star. The whole objective of the game is essentially to make his already-miserable life even worse. The angrier you make him, the more points you get. The pranks start out relatively mild (drawing on family photos, egg in the microwave, clogging the toilet, etc.) but as you progress through the game they become more complex and unique (shorting an outlet and electrocuting him, for example). The game can get boring at times, but usually there is a new and unique prank right around the corner to keep you entertained.\n\nThe first game confines you to the neighbour's house, starting with just the first and second floors. As you progress through the game, you will unlock more floors and rooms to access. The second game, however, is far more expansive and takes you to multiple places as you follow the neighbour on his vacation.\n\nOverall, these games are great for some stupid fun. Replay value is unfortunately pretty minimal, as once you've discovered everything you can do, there is limited enjoyment in re-watching the effects of the same pranks over and over again. But the first time through each game is well entertaining, and figuring out the various pranks definitely incorporates a fair amount of puzzle-solving elements (especially in the second game). While these elements are not overly-expansive, they do force you to think a bit. I would recommend this game to anyone looking for a few hours of cheap and stupid fun.","April 24, 2015","true","2.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

I played them when I was very young and I really enjoyed them. Even after over 10 years from their original release dates, they are still as funny as they were.\n\nIn Neighbours from Hell you control Woody, the star of a reality TV show, who is taking on his unpleasant and despicable neighbour. The very existence of that nasty odd bod is enough to make Woody's life a living hell. That's why our hero has sneaked into his neighbour's house to play one trick after the other on him.\n\nBut, well..... you cannot have access to steam overlay while playing these games because they are the same games from 10 years ago with some little updates and these games might have problems while playing in fullscreen on some systems. So you must run them in windowed mode by going to ((Users\Your Username\Documents\JoWooD\NFH1\gameoptions.xml)) and changing ((fullscreen="true")) to ((fullscreen="false")).\n\nIf you like Point and Click games with a lot of comedy or played these games before and want to try them again, buy them!

The same goes for the second game with the exact same game time. The art style is cartoonish/clay and fits with the theme of the game - TV show about pranks. I have to give it that it is original in it's concept, but that is about it for being special. The jokes are really focused for chlidren so as such I might not be the best reviewer. I found them okay at best but mostly they were simply not funny. The second game in particular is a bit tedious with the mini-games. After doing a level at 100% (which is easy in most levels) there is no point of playing it ever again. Overall both are okay games for people that like (corny) pranks a lot, I recommend getting it during a sale.","October 13, 2014","true","4.9"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

The idea is that you have to sneak around your neighbor's house and prank him.  Yup, that's it.\n\nPros:\n-Can't think of any\n\nCons:\n-Overly simplistic.  You just click on stuff in the house to ruin it.\n-Very repetitive.  Not only are the missions all basically the same, but every time the neighbor catches you, you have to redo everything you've already done in that mission.  To beat a mission, you basically need to turn it into a "speed run" where you do everything in a certain sequence and timing.\n-Overly linear.  There's no creativity in the pranks.  You have to use specific objects on specific objects like a point and click game.  All the pranks are totally "pre-cooked."\n-Poor controls.  The whole game's challenge hinges on not getting caught, but the UI makes this frustrating rather than challenging.\n-The main character seems like a total ♥♥♥♥.

It has some problem solving to prank the neighbor. It is sort of a television show setting. To advance, you need to play all of the pranks. The compilation comes with "Neighbours from Hell" and "Neighbours from Hell 2: on Vacation." Both are built well and you can tell there was a couple years in between the release of one and two. When I found it on Steam, I had a HUGE feel of Nostalgia. Then, I took it upon myself to buy it. I still have the original copies, but they won't work on my computer from how old they are. Anyways, the game structures are nice. The puzzles aren't too hard to solve in the first. The puzzles are more difficult in the second. This game is a TON of fun. It is quite nice to have this game on steam now for more people to discuss.","December 28, 2014","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
