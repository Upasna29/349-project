It seems like it's not, because this game is everything BUT scary. I find it amusing at times, for example, when you are running to "answer" the phone avoiding potato chip, mousetrap and rubber ducky landmines.\n\nHaving worked a lot on graveyard shifts myself, I find this entertaining. It's not bad, it's just...Boring, like real life itself.\n\nBasically, you have to pick up trash, one by one (Talk about poor efficiency), and drop it in the garbage bin that's located in the kitchen. Occasionally, electrical appliances will turn on by themselves. (Actually, by one of the spirits of the native americans, Laughing Bird, which sounds like he's crying instead of laughing). Now, I wouldn't classify Laughing Bird as an evil spirit, he's more of a "mischievous" spirit.\nTry to avoid making too much noise (Say, if you are running AND two or more appliances are on at the same time) or it's game over. Once you're done picking up trash (Each shift, the leftovers you have to collect go up by one), you have to sit like a dumbass waiting for the shift to end, probably playing with the jukebox, TV, or just looking out of the window, staring at the neverending darkness. My, what an accurate representation of graveyard shifts!\nOnce your shift ends, you are on to the next one, and you gotta do the same thing! On level 10, potato chip landmines start to appear, and later, rubber ducky landmines and the ♥♥♥♥ing worst, mousetrap landmines. Seriously, ♥♥♥♥ those, they are small and hard to  hit when you are in a hurry, they are the worst. Alright, now that you understand the basic concept of this game, do that for the next 29 nights and you win!\n\nThis game is pretty easy, I only failed twice, the first one was intentionally, to see what happens when you disturb the ancient spirit. (A lame jumpscare that doesn't even scare)\nAnd the second, because I got ♥♥♥♥ed by the trash placement. Random generated maps can work against you, or totally the opposite.\n\nAnd....That's pretty much all there is to say about this game. It's mindless, monotonous fun (I enjoy this, don't judge me), it's not bad, it's just....Not good either. I wouldn't recommend this personally, because my tolerance for crappy and mediocre games is way too high compared to the average Joe. Or you know, you could play this while you are smashed. Which doesn't sound too bad, to be honest.","June 13, 2015","false","2.8"," 30 of 33 people (91%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","91","30","33","8","0"

As the nights pass the prankster ghost will start turning on appliances to make enough noise to wake up the other cheftain, thus giving you a game over, and so you'll have to reach them to turn them off. Eventually the prankster ghost will start littering the diner with noisy obstacles (potato chips bags, rubber ducks and mouse traps, I kid you not) and you'll have to either pick them up or try to avoid them as you run from table to table.\n\nThat's all there's to it and before night 26 it's all so easy that it easily becomes boring once you're quickly done with all the dishes and realize you'll have to spend a couple more minutes just turning of appliances until the shift is over.  It's as dull as it sounds and the noisy obstacles just add annoyance to it, nothing more: couple this with the lack of scares or atmosphere and you'll see why I can't recommend the game. Oh and let's say that you, like me, will have the patience to go through the whole 30 nights what happens then? Nothing at all, no ending text or cutscenes, just some unskippable credits.\n\nI got it for free so no harm done, but even at the lowest sale price (1,50$) it simply has not enough going for it to be a worthwhile purchase.","July 24, 2015","false","3.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

It is definitely interesting, and has potential to become better, but right now the horror is somewhat lacking. First of all, for the first 12 nights, if you get the hang of the game fast enough, you won't die a single time, or even be in danger of dying. The sense of danger disappears, and the feeling of dread gets replaced by irritation, because of repetitive gameplay. The actual ghost that kills you is just a photoshopped picture that pops up on your screen for a second, and then gets replaced with game over. The death scene seems much too rushed, and could be improved. That being said, I am only on night 12. There is always the possibility that this game really picks up. But still, it should've picked up in pace on around night 6 or so. But all things considered, the game is still enjoyable, and even at times funny. Why the hell are you even working at a diner for a minimum wage, that has absolutely no customers, and that can literally kill you if you don't do your job well enough?

The last level is a real little nightmare (because difficulty, its not a Horror Game) you need to clean all tables from 15 things people let stay but if its not enough you need to stop nearly 20 things and some of them sound not much different so you need to think fast, and act even faster you need to pick up or avoid 3 objets the chips are great but the yellow swimming duck is smaller but still good to see even in dark lights but if you run trough a corner it can happen that you hit one and last but worst the rat trap very small and not good to see but even more a hell to pick up so you need maybe to avoid some rounds about it and cost time but this you dont have there are 2 things if you make to much sound you get a problem with the ghost and if you dont do all trash to the kitchen till 6 o clock you can restart too. Its not a very funny game only the sounds and design of the diner is really great and that if the sound comes louder and you get 3 message the fear comes to play the level again so its really good challenge to test your skills like what to do, what not and that in very less time only if you use the write strategies and have much luck you can beat level 30 a challenge for everyone but dont expect to much of the game its only a time hunt get better and better.

If it is supernatural, please tell me that my boss is a horrifying monster, it will explain a lot.\nOne last question, why all the dishes are totally not been touched, how disgusting are they.\n\nOk, I think I made my point here, now is the time to get a not so desperate job and get paid, hopefully I will get my 7 bucks back.","March 31, 2015","false","0.2"," 40 of 144 people (28%) found this review helpful 53 people found this review funny","28","40","144","53","2"

You have a set amount of time to clean up the restaurant while a different rival Chief attempts to troll you into trouble by turning on devices across the restaurant (and office) and end the shift.\n\nAnother member Aurora Mist described it correctly that it's like Diner Dash went out to the bar feeling lonely one night and met Five Nights at Freddy's.\n\nThat said, along with noting everyone's caution about horror tags being an error, this game isn't all that bad for what it is.  It's smooth, pretty good graphics, controls are easy (if you're a right-hander, as it's the standard WASD + mouse control) and the premise is easy to follow.  Clocks are visible in most rooms so you can glance at a whim to know how close to 6am you're getting.\n\nThe really bad thing, other than the error in marketing for the game, would be the ability to restart a game without being able to skip the story line.  Most things you can pick up along the way as far as what device has been turned on by rival Native American Chief Laughing Bird.  Though there are some that are so quiet that you're not even aware they're on unless you look down at the noise indicator (which is at the bottom of your screen).  You do however, have the ability to restart from whatever level you last successfully lasted through.  So, no need in saving anything (as you can't), it's simply based on levels/shifts.\n\nIn short, if you like repetative task games which try to test your reflexes/task thinking, then you will enjoy this game.  If you're not, it will bore you by the second level/shift.","March 6","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
