"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/393240/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","There are times that tearing into a game just isn’t pleasurable. Times when legitimate criticisms must be leveled at a title for numerous design deficiencies, but no joy can be gained from the walloping. That is the case with Sir! I’d Like To Report A Bug!. Developer and publisher Lord Puggington Games absolutely have their hearts in the right place. They set out to create a simple platformer with an engaging hook and tried very hard to create a real game to be sold at a budget price. Four dollars is absolutely reasonable for a copy of their efforts, but the time investment to play it would be much better spent elsewhere. So, with expectations in check, it is time to lay this title bare.\n\nThe premise of Sir! I’d Like To Report A Bug! remains intriguing. A lackadaisical game tester is the first to try a new piece of virtual reality hardware. After his experience with this machine, he finds that video game type bugs begin permeating the real world. Folks taking flight, buildings made from rubber, and an angry sun spitting hot fire are typical bugs that could be encountered, Each stage is either guiding Reggie, the protagonist, to work or from work. At the end of each stage the player is commanded to report the issues that were encountered from a long list of choices. Most options are jokes. Picking the wrong ones only results in being told that the incorrect choice was given. Until all choices are entered, the game will not proceed. This portion is reminiscent of a Highlights for Kids activity.\n\nExplaining this is simply a method of stalling before digging into the real disappointment. The actual stages and platforming. Reggie himself does not have any control issues. On the contrary, his sense of motion and physics mean that if he was placed in stages with a better sense of design, it would work quite well. As it is, the platforming and traversal are hampered by poor visual queues. There are many objects that are obviously intended to be platforms. Too often, though, the challenge lies in figuring out which object is background art and which is meant to act as a means of climbing up and over an obstacle.\n\nThese design flaws could be surmountable with a better balance. On its Steam store page, the devs brag that it is hard as nails. There is truth in advertising, but they don’t say why that is. The reason: cheap, annoying deaths. This is a game with simple controls, move and jump. The complexity should come into play with the gimmicks each level should contain. For the most part, though, these gimmicks are purely cosmetic and don’t offer the flow of play. It is not possible to jump on the rubber buildings to gain height and when people “stick” to Reggie, there is no change to the physics. These are missed opportunities.\n\nWhen actual gameplay changes occur, they tend to be aggravating. Laser bolts appearing from nowhere with no chance to dodge isn’t fun. It is pointlessly infuriating. When the player fails on normal mode, it is back to the beginning to start the trudge through the overlong level with repeated art assets all over again. There is a level where random objects arise and become Reggie-seeking missiles. Trying to dodge these and figure out which piece of background is meant to be used to gain height was my breaking point. It seems as though this game was designed solely to garner rage from Let’s Players, but it does not appear they are biting.\n\nOne thing to note is the chiptune soundtrack. While the base tune is not expertly crafted, it does sound like a more competent tune that could be found on an NES cart. Where it becomes noteworthy are in the remixes that occur. Sometimes it sounds as though an onboard sound chip is on the fritz. Sometimes the instrumentation changes, sometimes there’s no instrumentation at all. These tracks did, however, help lend the proper tone that the rest of the game was attempting to reach.\n\nTrying to dictate if Lord Puggington Games tried too hard or not hard enough with its gameplay is a fool’s errand. This doesn’t feel like something that was just slapped together; there is no malice intended in this review. This is a port of a mobile game that came to fruition via crowdfunding; one with a Google Play page that is loaded with accolades. It is at this point where the final piece of evidence must be introduced: the overuse of tired memes. How one can make a comment on the overuse of the “arrow to the knee joke” while unironically using these other tired tropes is a topic for speculation. Will an answer ever be found? Probably not. Ain’t nobody got time for that.","November 21, 2015","false","8.9"," 93 of 108 people (86%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","86","93","108","8","4"

The rest of the humor follows this trend. 2-lol-so-randumb-4-me/10\n\nAlso, the gameplay is "run back and forth between the same two places over and over watching SUCH RANDOM bugs happen, and then pick the bugs out from a list to report them." One day you may have the sun spitting fireballs at you, another day some of the floor may be lava, but it's all incredibly basic, painfully easy platforming, and after 15 minutes you'll be sick and tired of it.\n\nIf you do dare keep playing, you'll eventually be presented with traps such as laser beams and flying boxes that have little to no tell as to when they'll fly at you. This isn't challenging or fun, because while you can learn where they'll spawn, you can't learn when, and they all move faster than your character, and will lead to dozens of deaths and zero progress as a result. This isn't mentioning how there's no checkpoints unless you play on easy mode.\n\nEdit: They also made an arrow to the knee joke, kill me now.","January 1","false","7.7"," 40 of 48 people (83%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","83","40","48","5","2"

I think the art is well done, and the music is great! Sometimes I get a little frustrated, because I didn't see some obsticle coming, but I wouldn't call the death cheap. Honestly, I think the only thing the game needs is a check point system! (Because I've died a few times way too close to the end of the levels and I'm very salty about that.) Just so I can pick back where I left off, rather than lose my momentum by ending up at the beggining of the level.\nBut really, this game is great! And if you want something fun to do for a little while, I'd say pick it up!","October 19, 2015","true","0.7"," 17 of 31 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","17","31","0","0"

A simplistic 2-D sidescrolling A to B game where you the player control a bug tester for some development team. Going through a week of the life, you spill out the very bugs being tested on into the real world.

Really goes back to the early 90s where you had rock hard platformers with just that one more go feel. Imagine Bart Vs The Space Mutants on the Genesis with a load of self referencal humor and you are half way there to describing this game. Its hard, but it never feels unfair, the graphics are nice but its the humor and the quirkyness of what goes on that really make this game. It controls well which is always a major plus in these types of games and has a nice flow and reason to get onto the next level. You can certainly tell it's been made with a lot of fun.\n\nWell worth a blast, and at a bargain price too. Treat yourself or a friend to a modern take on a retro game and be prepared to laugh the bugs that happen in this game. I wish more retro games would take on this games retro qualities and not just the pixel look.","December 16, 2015","true","1.1"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"
