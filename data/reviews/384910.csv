Where is she? Is she still alive?\nPlay it and find out...\n\n2)Gameplay:\nThe red hotspot indicates the object (or character) with which you can interact. The right button of the mouse gives you some description of what you are observing (that appears at the top of the screen); some objectes require a close scrutiny when they are in your inventory (at the bottom of your screen). Some of them can also be combined.\nCollect everything, it could come in handy later (all has a purpose!)\nAt the start of the game you are given a folder and a strange coin: don’t forget to dip in to it..you never know what clues can come through!\nDuring the game you will find a map that shows the main buildings and clicking on them will move you there immediatly.\nWhen you try to use something on a red hotspot, if it’s the right thing, it will wobble..but sometimes even if it’wobbling, it will not fit..so it may be of help having an ample point of view and using your wits.\nDon’t let any “dark corner” goes unchecked because the answer.. can be in plain sight..\n\nBeing Last Half of The Darkness a saga, if you want to have the whole picture of its story, you have to start from “Shadows of the Servant” then “Beyond the Spirit’s Eye, “Tomb of Zojir” and “Society of the Serpent Moon”.\n\nI like these games because their plots are good and engaging; the puzzles and riddles are comprehensible and the gameplay is easy and neat.\n\nSo my rating for them is 8/10","August 4, 2015","true","18.9"," 24 of 26 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","24","26","0","2"

The TL;DR is that getting 4 pretty good point-and-click adventures for this price is pretty great. However, if you'd like to look over what all is offered, I wrote up each review. When you purchase the set, I highly recommend going to the community centre and downloading the launchers made by Zeikar, otherwise, getting the first 3 games to play will be difficult.\n\nShadows of the servants:\nPlayed from a 1st person point of view, this first installment seems almost dependent on the "pop on screen" kind of scare tactics. The voices are difficult to understand, but many important "clues" are not captioned. You must have the sound on to catch everything. I seriously recommend a notebook of some kind and very fast writing skills.\nIn my personal opinion, there are many puzzles in this installment that make little to no logical sense. There is no hint system or map, so you are required to go back and check everything on a regular basis. On the plus side, when you find the correct item, it will wiggle in front of the hot spot, so you can use a little process of elimination. Regardless, I'd be surprised if you don't have to look up help a few times while you play.\n\nBeyond the Spirit's Eye:\nAlso played from the 1st person point of view, there is less "pop up" action, but this installment is still very creepy. More of the speech is captioned, but the voices are still very difficult to understand. If you want to know the twist at the end, make sure you've got your headphones on, because none of that is captioned.\nThe puzzles in this game are much more logically sound. There were very few times I was at a complete loss as to what came next. That being said, there are a lot more red herrings and many items that are very difficult to find, if you don't click every millimetre of your screen. On the positive side, there is a map included in this game. It's not super useful, but it does help you travel to 5 main areas of the adventure.\nBy far, the most annoying part of this game is that there is no way to skip the animated scenes. There are certain rooms that play a full animation every time you go in them, and there's no choice but to sit back and watch the same scene over and over again.\n\nTomb of Zoljir:\nPlayed from a 1st person point of view, the most immediate difference in this installment is that you can actually understand the voices. The captioning is done much better than the previous two, and the graphics are noticeably better. However, despite the much better captioning, you absolutely have to have headphones available. One puzzle, in particular, requires you to listen to the clicks of a wheel, and the different sound is the correct choice. The map is much more useful than in Beyond the Spirit's eye.\nOf the four, this is the one that I think has the most content. I spent the longest on it, and 90% of the puzzles are pretty straight forward. There's still a lot of traveling back and forth, but not as much as the previous 2.\n\nSociety of the Serpent Moon:\nPlayed from a 3rd person perspective, this installment moves very slow because you're always waiting for your character to walk across the screen. On the plus side, it gives you tons of time to think. They've made it so that you can double-click on the entrance/exit and leave a room immediately. They've also made it so that you push Tab and can see your entrances/exits. There are very few repeating animated scenes (unlike Spirit's Eye), but you can skip any or all of them with a simple right-click.\nThis game is pretty much stand-alone when compared to the others. Installments 1-3 reference one another and have very similar feels while this game seems to be a completely different story.\nThe puzzles follow logic. Very few red herrings, very few "WTF?!?" moments. A map allows you to travel from one area to the next with very few problems, once you find it.","September 7, 2015","true","5.9"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","13","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deadfraggle/recommended/384910/","deadfraggle","deadfraggle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deadfraggle/","176 products in account","This is an adventure game in the style of Sierra Online's original 'Quest' titles, like King's Quest, Space Quest and Police Quest. No previous knowledge of prior 'Last Half of Darkness' games is required to play or to understand the storyline.  In order to find and save your girlfriend from a dark cult, you explore various fixed-camera scenes in a seedy town for clues. I found the puzzles fun and solving them was great satisfaction for a player who is normally stumped on games like this with without a walkthrough. The most difficult aspect for me was finding all the objects that are needed as tools in other locations. Be sure to search every nook and cranny for usable items.\n\nThis steam package also includes a free copy of Tomb of Zojir and 3 other games.  Tomb of Zojir is a 'must play' for fans of the genre and is worth the price of admission alone!","August 11, 2015","true","15.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

Ive been cornered in a cavern by servents, and according to the walkthrough, need a last green coin to get out, but I dont have one!!! Impossible to progress further, and thanks to the autosave, I cant just reload an earlier game, I'd have to start over.
