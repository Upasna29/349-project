Bientôt l'été isn't a game. It's an artistic piece, and this needs to be understood. From what I could gather, the goal of it was to demonstrate how people can communicate, even if limited by language, actions, or possible phrases (as seen by the chess board in-game). However, this requires that someone somewhere is playing at the same time you are, unless you want to talk to an AI. It's a beautiful experience when it works well, but this is so rare I can't recommend a purchase at any time other than during a sale. Due to the game's artistic goal and nature, it was heavily slammed upon release, driving away potential players. Without a community waiting for another person to chat with, more people slammed the game for not having a community. This is Bientôt l'été's biggest problem, without players it simply cannot achieve the desired effect.\nFor this reason I suggest buying this when it's on sale. More players are likely to be experimenting with it at the same time as you, and you're more likely to see the beauty of limited conversation with a complete stranger.","November 25, 2013","false","0.3"," 140 of 153 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","140","153","0","1"

At first, it seemed confusing with the long walks on the beach and random phrases popping up on screen, but only once I entered the café did I realize the actual draw of this title. As I sat at the chess board and waited five minutes for a partner to join, I then realized something else; I was the only person to buy this game. Thank god they included a computer controlled character to interact with or I may have missed the hidden gem in this pile of coal.\nWe moved our chess pieces across the board and spoke sweet nothings to each other until only silence hung in the air. And then I saw it. Near the bottom of the screen was a classic lighter and a half full soft pack of smokes. Move over wine glass! The true beauty and meaning of game play was at hand. Once clicked, the screen goes black and you can actually hear your character click the flint, light up, and take a long, smooth drag. You can almost taste the tobacco. A puff of smoke fills the screen upon return to the scene. The cigarette is then seen majestically smoldering in the ashtray on the table. If clicked again, another drag is taken until there is nothing but a snuffed out filter left.\nOh, but that's just the beginning. It seems there is no limit to the amount of cigarettes you can smoke! My only complaint would be that there aren't enough ways to put out your coffin nail. The choice to put it out on your lover's hand or leave it floating in their wine glass should be included in a future patch for the sole reason that some of the predestined lines are mad creepy. 8 out of 10 because I can't tell if they're menthol or not.","February 12, 2013","true","3.2"," 52 of 75 people (69%) found this review helpful 58 people found this review funny","69","52","75","58","0"

While Bientôt l'été has the most conventional controls and straightforward instructions of their games to date, it still suffers from the same problem: some strange design decisions have little to nothing to do with, and may even hinder the concept.\n\nImagine the PS3 game Journey: two players meet at random in a surreal world to make a connection. Except in Bientôt l'été, both players are chat robots stating phrases at random while smoking cigarettes, drinking wine, and playing chess (with a catch: you have to find the pieces first, but one at a time). The highlight of the game should be the multiplayer, but unfortunately it doesn't seem to be very populated (a symptom of its avant garde concept, I guess), and the interactions are severely limited.\n\nWhat should be a virtual date with a stranger in a surreal world becomes tedius, with no real interaction or connection with said stranger. Unlike Journey, which limits your characters' intractability to serve the purpose of the mechanics and design, Bientôt l'été's design stands at odds with its concept, preventing players from creating any kind of meaningful connections.","December 4, 2013","false","0.2"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","22","25","0","0"

I typically really enjoy introspective forlorn romps through artsy settings, but this is a bit of a streatch even for me.\n\nSpoilers follow:\n\n\nNo seriously, there's nothing to this game, so litterally anything I say past this point will "ruin" it for you.\n\nDon't read further unless you've either already played it our have no intention to.\n\n\nSo the idea is that you go for long walks on the beach reflecting on this relationship you've had. Sometimes there's something on the beach that will drop a chess peice which you can take to the house and use on a chess board to hold something resembling a conversation with an online partner... The dialouge seems to suggest that these two love each other out of necessity and not for any actual romantic reasons... they don't seem to actually like each other but are bound to eachother anyway. It's really sad...These two need to see other people, but it's clear that there are no other fish in the sea, so to speak.\nOh, and once you've collected all the chess peices, the next item to drop is a gun... well that escalated quickly. You can use the gun on the chess board like a peice. It does nothing in particular, but I think it's more meant to be a metaphore for putting an end to the relationship more than anything.\n\nTo sum up the game: Help I'm trapped in a holodeck of angst and regret!

You walk your male or female avatar on a beach. Turn around, there's a house of sorts, which will change in appearance when you enter and come out. Inside, you can sit at a chess table, drink wine and smoke, place chess pieces on the board.. with a partner in front of you (most likely an AI since noone is ever around for real) doing the same.\n\nYou go back out.. from time to time there will be random things on the beach.. like a huge pile of coal.. a wheat field.. dead seagulls.. which you briefly watch and then 'collect' the memory of (which just means it disappears and your avatar bends down like picking up a pebble, there's no inventory or anything..). Going in each direction for a little while you realize the space is rather limited, but feels bigger since it's sooo empty.\n\nAnd that's pretty much it.\n\nWhat is it trying to say ? No clue.\nWhat would be different if someone else was there for real ? No clue.\nIs there any point to it ? No clue.\nIs there more to be seen or experienced if you stick to it ? No clue.

I also enjoy Tale of Tales other games, like The Path. I simply do not understand nor enjoy this game at all. I went into it with low expectations and an open mind, I left questioning exactly what should be considered "art" in gaming.\n\nBientôt l'été is the most pretentious of pretentious indie art games. One that is "too deep for you" to even understand whatever trivial message it's trying to put across. Let me just say right now that when a developer needs to address their entire userbase in a forum post, revealing what their inspiration for the game was in order for you to understand its purpose, then the developer has completely failed to convey any sort of rational thought with their game. Still, no one slightly understands the purpose of Bientôt l'été and those who do are obviously elitist intellectuals whose thoughts and opinions on the matter are also "too deep for you" to understand yet again. It's hard not to call Poe's Law into play.\n\nThis game has a mechanical crutch which becomes limited by its users. The main attraction of Bientôt l'été is being able to connect with other players in a cafe of sorts, decked out with a chess board, a glass of wine, cigarettes, and the ability to communicate intricately with one another. Except this all falls apart when you realise you're the sole person in existence to be playing this game at this point in time, forcing you to instead substitute a human presence with artificial intelligence. This severely impacts the game as a whole.\n\nI never found a partner to play with so I had to resort to A.I., and after collecting all of the chess pieces I managed to find a gun... although my character holds it backwards. Does this gun do anything more than intimidate the opposing player? If not, then there is no point to this game since there aren't enough people playing this game at any one time; you can't really surprise artificial intelligence.\n\nThe entire process of Bientôt l'été took me little over 80 minutes to achieve. After collecting the gun and positioning all the chess pieces in their correct order, hoping for something to "unlock" or tell me I've done something right, only to find out nothing much happens. I decided to go back out and collect more items, coming to a stinging realisation that the cycle has restarted and I'm collecting the very first chess pieces again.\n\nThis game is insulting.","March 24, 2013","false","1.6"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

It provides less exploration and narration than for example Dear Esther, but a bit more than for example Proteus, and has it's own unique graphical style and ambiance. The graphics, sounds and music give you an eerie feeling, it's dream-like, surreal and transcendental, and for this alone it's interesting to look at and listen to, eventually even admirable.\n\nYou select a male or female character stored inside tubes. "It's nearly summer" you are told. You appear with your character on a simulated/virtual beach shore and walk it. Random phrases will appear drawn onto the ground. You "collect" ("remember) some of them by closing your eyes, you also hear them voiced  in French then (they are always subtitled in the language of your choice). You collect some object "hidden" beneath some worldly, "holographic" thing (a tree, a bush, a crane, ...) that disappears to reveal this object (chess pieces mostly, and one more unique and confusing one which leaves room for interpretation). You enter a house, meet with a virtual partner of the opposite gender in some sort of bar, put your objects in turns on a chessboard (freely, you don't actually play chess - some spots trigger the words/phrases you previously collected to appear on the screen and be voiced), take a smoke, drink some whine or select some pre-set of music tracks to play music-box like in the background. The lines you collect and make appear are circling around the two characters and their relationship, who are or used to be lovers  After that you leave the house, walk along the shore again, collect more phrases and another object and enter the house again. This you repeat as many times as you wish, at some point the simulation starts over again with you collecting about the same pieces again (the game however seems to remember all pieces you once collected - I've just started up the game again and could place all the objects I once picked up many months back when I first played this game).\n\nThe partner in the house is either A.I.-controlled or an actual human who is playing the game at the same time as you do. You don't see his/her name, he/she is a stranger, there is no text or voice chat to use, you only communicate with the words and through symbolism you can do with the chessboard and the objects, and the only indication whether there is someone else playing/waiting in the house is - from what I've been told and noticed - a window you see from the outside that has lights on. I haven't been able to meet up with a real human yet, because either the mechanics to match you up with one are not working too well or this game was never played by too many people to begin with. There is a Steam group one can join, and sometimes people try to group up through it. However this is a bit of a misleading way of playing this game, since it was obviously intended to meet strangers, an idea Tale of Tales originally came up with in "The Endless Forest", but which isn't executed too well in this game. A game that did this better was the PSN game "Journey". But I guess one must probably consider that "Journey" was a larger success than any of Tale of Tales' games ever were - the more players play these games the higher/better the chances to meet up with them. At some point no one will play these anymore, I guess, not even "Journey".\n\nThe control scheme isn't entirely bad but not exactly too enjoyable. This is a problem I keep seeing in the games made by Tale of Tales. You look around by moving the mouse to either side of the screen, you walk by holding down the left mouse button, you close your eyes with the right mouse button and run with spacebar. It feels odd/awkward and not very comforting. They could adapt to the more classic control schemes that games with a first- and third-person view give you, the usual WASD and mouse-look thing. I don't see any good reason in doing things differently there. Has it to do with being different for the sake of being different? Or are they inept and don't play their own games? I don't know, and I don't like being harsher to them than they deserve. You can play with a gamepad too, maybe I should try that and will feel better then.","April 18, 2014","true","5.3"," 25 of 39 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","25","39","0","0"

Bientôt l'été reminds me not of other games, but of novels (by Maurice Blanchot), films (by Marguerite Duras) and paintings (by Henri Matisse). It has the most basic gameplay, which consists of walking along the shore and placing chess pieces on a chess board (but without actually playing the game of chess). It also has no story in the usual sense, instead it gives you a set of disjointed images and some kind of exquisite machine for producing texts.\n\nSomehow Bientôt l'été generates an amazing experience, melancholic dream of the future. Just an "atmospheric exploration", yes, but what a fantastic atmosphere to feel, what an outlandish (yet familiar) place to explore. Picture is beautifully oversaturated, sometimes almost with one color, music and sounds blend together in a warm noise, waves hit the shore, some moons and planets travel across the sky, there is a single building nearby, couple talks in French inside. Player takes role of one of the lovers, who also act, participate in simulation. Communication in this world is difficult, you only have quotes and gestures, things unsaid. You try to speak and to listen.","March 21","true","2.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

After finding each of these objects, you get a chess piece to use in the cafe that's present across from the water.\n\nWhen you enter the cafe, you sit down at a chessboard and wait for someone to connect (or use their extremely awkward in-game partner connect to actually play with a friend). After waiting at least 10 minutes to connect to an actual player, the view changes to a top-down of the chessboard and you both take turns placing your own chess pieces on the board. Some spaces make your character say a line of conversation (which can be found by walking across the beach).\n\nIcy and I played this for an hour and a half and we could not discover any sort of progression. After you collect all your chess pieces you come across some sort of pistol. This pistol can also be placed on the chessboard, but does nothing else once on it.\n\nThe story seems to be a very weak and very cliche talk of romance between artists gone sour. I'm sure the developers have an idea of what it /actually/ means and expect some users to gain a lot from the shallow symbolism, but in all honesty this would have been better as a 15 minute independant film.\n\nI would recommend against buying this. It doesn't belong on Steam.","March 14, 2013","false","1.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","4"

In this game you walk around a strange, silent world and can interact with objects to gain chess pieces.  You can then use the chess pieces to have a virtual conversation with a stranger.  The more chess pieces you have the more options you have as far as things to say.  The interesting thing is that you each play the role of lovers and so the conversation has a strange intimacy even though the participants themselves are strangers. The possibility is that you might share a moment of connection with a stranger over these bits and pieces of dialogue and action.  However, I have played this game three or four times and have never been paired with a living person.  The other choice is to participate in the conversation with a simulation.  And in this case, interaction with a simulation is hollow and completely misses the point because there is no chance for that spark of human connection.\n","June 12, 2013","true","0.7"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

The developers of this game is akin to Jackson Pollock throwing paint onto a canvas, severely lacking talent.\n\nI have played most of the Tale of Tales series, while Bientôt l'été is not nearly as awful as The Graveyard, it comes pretty darn close. The game is apparently suppose to simulate distance dating, but I couldn’t connect to a single human being throughout my game time. I was forced to deal with quite frankly one of the dumbest A.I. on the planet through a series of dialogue controlled by playing some bizarro version of chess. I’m calling it chess, but it isn’t really chess, it’s just chess pieces being plopped onto the board at random. Here is a sampler of the dialogue.\n\nMe: “I look at you”\nA.I: “I think a lot about you since have seen you again”\nMe: “I would like a glass of wine”\nA.I: “How odd I have no desire to return”\n\nEvery other line of dialogue follows the same trend of uninspiring and mundane one liners.\n\nOnce outside you will immediately notice the artsy fartsy graphic style. The colors are super bright and the film grains a plenty. You can collect items outside which will reward you with a rather lame fly by cutscene of the item. That is it, that is the entire game.\n\nYou want to play a game like Bientôt l'été?

Because that's what this game is, a fanciful and supposedly symbolic experience in which you will reflect on whatever you can imagine to be the depth of the 'piece'.\nSecondly, are you seeking an actually meaningful or deep experience that doesn't require DIY symbolism, perhaps with a strong but non-violent narrative? If you are, then turn away immediately, the game simply isnt worth your time.\nAnd thirdly, do you mind performing repetitive actions with very little benefit? If you do, then perhaps you should try something else, like the Stanley Parable or something.\n\nMy personal opinion of the game is that if I have paid good currency on a piece of content, then there should actually be content and that content should be legible and self constructing. I should not receive a random set of letters and have to conjure up some sentence. The sentence should come at least partially pre-made to give the thought some sort of legitimacy. If I have to make it up without any kind of confidence that that is what the media was saying, then the thought won't only be short lived, it'll probably be too weak to have any kind of effect when it is in my mind. Deus Ex Human Revolution creates a moral dilemma out of a slowly constructed jigsaw that you see pieced together before you, the Stanley Parable hints at the deeper meanings of it's gags but only so much as to force you to complete the meaning yourself. Both games have made me seriously think about the messages they were pushing.

So how is this game ? Its okay. It definatly doesnt make up for the reason you cant beat it. Yeah thats right it never ends. I feel like the game could have a lot of potential which feels that the potential never got used. So whats the story ? You play as a pair of lovers who feel alone without each other. The gameplay is pretty simple all you do is walk around  the beach then you play chess with youre lover. I felt that the game is definatly a good game but it only would apeal to art lovers .

Most people would'nt even call it a game. But because it says to review your game... I am.\n\nThis game provides the player with a soothing soundtrack and very pleasing visuals that are easy on the eyes. You don't have to worry about your eye balls rotting from your head while playing this because it's a low light beach scenario.\nThis "game" is based around either a male or female character (the sex is user option) who is looking for lost love or maybe they have given up on it? and they scower the beach for lines of dialogue to use in a game of chess along with chess board pieces. You can use those chess board pieces to play online with a random opponent (which may take time to find) or a robot wich is still equally fun. Usually the human takes their pieces and flails them around the board and ruins the entire experience.\n\nPut on your headphones to get the most out of this "game" it trult changes the experience.\n\nI reccomend this game because it is a stress reliever. It isn't a demanding game, but still looks beautiful and you can just do it without really thinking. It's very pleasing.","May 7, 2014","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is as existential as a game could possibly be. It makes "Dinner Date" look like Minecraft.\n\nThis is a walk on the beach simulator, diddling with a chess board simulator, yearning conversation with a ghost simulator. I think there were cigarettes and wine to be had, too.\n\nWhile I'm generally down with the whole "this-is-not-a-game" concept, I would have enjoyed Bientôt l'été more if it didn't take an age to walk anywhere, and if it adhered to standard norms for controlling your in-game avatar. You have to close your eyes before you can open a door? What is that all about? I spent a lot more time looking at the control scheme than I should have needed to.\n\nAlso, the game apparently needs other people playing at the same time so you can be paired up male/female for weepy, maudlin conversation where you take turns selecting phrases from a list of approved phrases. Presumably you are holiday-fling soulmate lovers, by the tone of the conversation. If nobody else is present, you get to have this conversation with a ghost, but the ghost just chooses random phrases, which isn't very satisfying. My point is, it's essentially a multiplayer game, but multiplayer doesn't work because nobody is "playing" this "game."\n\nHaving said that, I still give Bientôt l'été a thumbs-up. Because, you know, well, ...boobs.","December 23, 2014","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I didn't bother with the collecting of things that you can do in the game, I just wandered around the beach and unwound for a while.\n\nIt reminded me of how when I first played Ocarina of Time, I just spent thirty minutes watching the sun rise and fall, and the specks of light travel around the Kokiri village. Or when I'd play the first Mass Effect game and just stop driving the Mako for a moment and just sit still, staring at the planet hanging overhead with the great big chunk taken out of it. This is a game to just indulge in a beautiful wide vista and the feelings that inspires.\n\nOne crticique I do have is that the controls were a bit clumsier than I'd like. Sometimes I'd get thrown out of appreciating the environment because I'd get stuck or have trouble turning around.\n\nPersonally, I'd happily pay for something like this again but with smoother controls and a variety of environments to explore. Wow, if I could just wander the settings of Xenoblade Chronicles for example, without getting stabbed in the face by a Mechon, that would be lovely. I'd love an exploration game just about travelling around an amazing world like that.\n\nSometimes you want to save the world.

However this game just goes the low-effort route and only builds a rather small patch of beach and you quickly run into the walls at the edge. In general the whole movement just feels to restrictive and annoying. Either you are wondering what the hell you are supposed to do or the walking feels to slow or whatever and then there is the whole chess multiplayer thing that nobody is playing.\n\nI do believe that such an art-piece can work, but for that it would need more polish and freedom. I don't want to be constantly reminded that I am just playing a low budget video game with all it's typical restrictions. Take Minecraft, it doesn't even try to be a fancy art-game, but Minecraft gets it right. It's a huge procedural world without boundaries. You don't have to wonder where you have to go to trigger the chess minigame, because the game world follows a consistent logic. You can just walk along at the beach and enjoy the sunrise in Minecraft, you don't have to second guess what the author meant to do, you can just get lost in the world. That's something that an art game should aim for, but Bientôt l'été misses the mark. You never can get lost in this world, because there is to much jank to pull you back out.\n\nA game doesn't just need to look good on screenshot, it must feel good when you are actually interacting with it and this just doesn't.","June 15, 2015","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Nothing is explained, not even the weird little mini games that comprise the entirety of the gameplay (oh, and walking). Don't go into this expecting any kind of consistent gameplay, story, objectives or characters. There is no narrator speaking sweet words of meaningful poetry like in the trailers. It's just walking, finding incredibly obscure 'clues' to further the castrated fragment of a story, playing chess with AI (since there is no one on multiplayer) and repeating the process again until there's just nothing left to do. I'm pretty sure the aim was for this to be a spiritual or transcendental experience of some depth but it just comes off as dry, pretentious and depressing.

Movies and books are cited as examples of non-interactive entertainment.\n\n3 If no goals are associated with a plaything, it is a toy. (Crawford notes that by his definition, (a) a toy can become a game element if the player makes up rules, and (b) The Sims and SimCity are toys, not games.) If it has goals, a plaything is a challenge.\n\n4 If a challenge has no "active agent against whom you compete," it is a puzzle; if there is one, it is a conflict. (Crawford admits that this is a subjective test. Video games with noticeably algorithmic artificial intelligence can be played as puzzles; these include the patterns used to evade ghosts in Pac-Man.)\n\n5 Finally, if the player can only outperform the opponent, but not attack them to interfere with their performance, the conflict is a competition. (Competitions include racing and figure skating.) However, if attacks are allowed, then the conflict qualifies as a game.\n\nCrawford's definition may thus be rendered as[original research?]: an interactive, goal-oriented activity made for money, with active agents to play against, in which players (including active agents) can interfere with each other.\n\nwhy do i put this here?\noh no reason\nno goals great so you guys immedatly did not make a ♥♥♥♥ing game\noh don't get me wrong it is good looking piece of software but it doesn't qualify above 3 on this list\ni'm trying to figure out if it qualifies above 2 even... so basicly this is between a plaything and piece of interactive entertainment...\nbut is it even interactive? i could get someone probly to try this out along side me but tbh this is a book with ability to walk the pages...(bad comparison i agree)...\nso this is not a game this is a weird artsy plaything(don't get me wrong i liek how it looks i'd like to see similar ideas implemented in actual GAME)\n\ni was gona do a video review but tbh... not worth my editing time\n\nnow why i don't recoment this game:\nIT IS NOT A GAME... barrack paper scicors on youtube is a better GAME(and with better love story)","February 10","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Why is there a cruise ship? Why is there a dead dog? Also there's no actual dialogue to be held.\nIf the game would give me anything else than loosely throwing phrases at me acompanied by items that don't appear to have anything to do with them then i could absolutely dig it, but in that form... i just feel like i wasted that 1 hour.","May 16","false","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","4"
