It is an evolution of the snooker mode in Pool Nation FX with traditional visual aesthetics and enhanced physics that are tailored for snooker.\n\nOriginal Review:\nAs someone who has been into pool and snooker for 20-odd years, I consider this game to be the most enjoyable virtual representation of the sports. If you want to know why Pool Nation FX is the best pool/snooker proposition on Steam, or any platform for that matter, you can read the following paragraphs.\n\nTo start with, let's see how it compares to the original Pool Nation game. While PNFX does not redefine the formula, it surely refines it. With the original game being quite successful, not many changes were needed anyway. The graphics are obviously prettier and there is a wider variety of locations, but the strongest points of PNFX compared to its predecessor are the improved table cloth speed, which feels more realistic, and the addition of snooker. The only real advantage that the original PN holds, are the lower system requirements.\n\nBut how does the game compare to the competition? There is Pure Pool, which is currently similarly priced. I had the chance to try that game having previously enjoyed its predecessor, Hustle Kings, on the PS3. I had relatively high expectations, but was pretty disappointed with it. Yes, it also has pretty graphics (not as pretty as PNFX), but the controls feel awkward, which makes controlling your shot power really hard, and the camera does not give you any freedom (basically, your view point is stuck to the cue, making aim-off play not a pleasant experience). All this is coupled with questionable physics, so I don't think anything else needs to be said about that game.\nThen, there is Virtual Pool 4. To be fair, I have not played this game, as I tried downloading the demo, but after installing it, the game would just crash instantly after starting every single time. This was apparently a problem that occurred with the full game as well, but it should be fixed now. However, I didn't want to risk buying it. Speaking of such issues, various people have had crashing problems with PNFX, so neither game is immune to technical bugs. At least with PNFX, you can try the free version to see if it runs well for you. Technical stuff aside, from what I have seen and heard about VP4, it might hold some advantage in terms of physics simulation. The obvious disadvantage of VP4 though are the dated graphics. While gameplay is surely more important, playing in good-looking locations, which create a nice atmosphere, and having detailed tables and almost realistic balls, adds a lot to the overall experience for me. The other major drawback of VP4 is the pricing - currently it is twice as expensive as PNFX, but more importantly - if you want to continue playing it online, you have to pay a yearly subscription fee of 10 bucks. Compare this to the lifetime PNFX online pass, which costs 4 bucks. So, is it worth it to pay that much more for a slightly better simulation aspect? At least for me, the answer is "No".\n\nA major plus of PNFX is that the game continues to evolve. To be fair, just a couple of months ago when the game started as an Early Access title, there were so many issues, that I would probably have not recommended it at that point. Credit to the team though, as they took care of the major issues to make the game much more polished. There are still things to be addressed, but as I said - development continues. If you have constructive feedback, the developers are willing to listen and change the game. I have personally provided a lot of feedback, and it is quite satisfying to see your suggestions make it into the game.\n\nSo, why does the game have such a low score then? Well, the answer consists of 3 words - "Free to Play". As a bit of background - the game was not supposed to offer a F2P version initially. Cherry Pop were kind enough to offer part of the game for free in order to increase the online population, as well as offer more people a chance to try the game. However, instead of enjoying the chance to try the game, a lot of people started posting negative reviews because they didn't get the whole game for free. Before PNFX went F2P, the average review score was around 90%, but because of people who generally don't care about pool that much and feel entitled to get stuff for free, the current score is much lower. You can choose for yourself whether to trust all those reviewers that have spent less than an hour in the game, or someone who has spent well over 100 hours in it.","December 15, 2015","true","381.5"," 57 of 72 people (79%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","79","57","72","6","3"

I have a few things to say as to whether or not I would recommend the game or not.\n\nPositives:\n\nIt looks great. However, having spent so much time in the original game, at this stage in time...1.6 hours... I prefer the look of the original game compared to Pool Nation FX. But perhaps the new look will grow on me over time.\n\n\nMore content. Pool Nation FX features an all-new career mode which is a big improvement from the original Pool Nation. It boasts many new locations and the 'play with skill to win' approach makes single-player pool a joy to play. Snooker is a great feature in Pool Nation. Me and a friend had an enjoyable time and like the other modes, are great.\n\nNegatives:\n\nI think the speed of the cloth could be adjusted. Perhaps there could be a slider added to the game, or a 'slow' or 'fast' speed option could be implemented. My friend and I were almost always complaining how the speed of the cloth could be better. It is fair, yes, but variety will always be appreciated.\n\nSetting up a game with my friend had been slightly difficult as my friend had a microphone switched on in the lobby but I could not find a way to mute him so I had ended up turning the whole game down in the mixer.\n\nCompared to Pool Nation, aiming and potting has become a lot harder, with or without aim assistance. I wish as I was taking my shot that I could look down the table even further. I have been using the middle mouse button to aim the cue more vertically to line up the cue ball better... however, it is still difficult.\n\nI have been looking forward to Pool Nation FX for so long now that I cannot help but want any improvement the game can get. However, the game is great and I am very satisfied with my purchase. Also, thank you so much for the loyalty discount!\n\nThank you, Cherry Pop Games!","October 7, 2015","true","7.9"," 73 of 98 people (74%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","74","73","98","8","6"

I plan to buy it but I wanted to see the game from a free to play perspective first. When I first downloaded it, it was great and yes a lot of things were locked but a few games later I had some cash and was able to unlock some neat stuff.\n\nI don’t mind the free model where you unlock things by playing the game, it makes sense that those who play a lot have access to more content.\n\nThe problem I have is the recent update: After the update a lot of good changes were made but also a VERY bad change was made. They changed the amount of money it costs to unlock many things. I’m not talking a small increase of 1k-2k here I’m talking a pool stick that was 5k is now 40k and the pool room I wanted to unlock for 4k (which I was only 300 away from before bed last night) is now 15k.\n\nThis change has made it nearly impossible for any free user to make any progress unlocking the games features in any reasonable amount of time. Spending 4 days of grinding to unlock a single pool stick? I’ll pass on that.\n\nSo, with that aside I would still suggest the game because it is damn fun and just like loading up in a real pool hall you never know who your opponent may be and it’s the challenge to outwit them. Good luck and have fun.\n","January 26","true","19.5"," 25 of 33 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","25","33","0","0"

I played it for several hours and it was great, lot of fun. The interaction with the other players is really easy and I made a new friend in the first few hours. They need to polish the aiming a bit, the camera angle for jump shot could be a lot better, but there is no "game breaking" glitch or bug. I suspect most of the "pro pool players of the internet" are those bullies super annoying in every pool hall, I wouldn't pay too much attention to their review. There is no "pay wall",  I played for 10+ hours without spending a dollar, the new maps and cues you get are really optional. I played the Yahoo pool games for several years and I can tell you this game is a great contender to become the next big thing in the pool scene.\n\nLet me break down the pros and cons;\n\nPros:\n-Insane graphics, could be the best out there for a pool game\n-Great physic, it's not perfect, but then again, it could be the best physic out there for a pool game!\n-All the menus/UIs are super intuitive and user friendly\n-It's easy and quick to find a game, you can really start you game and play a pool game in a few minutes then do something else!\n-VOIP, it's well made, intuitive\n\nCons: (I will really break down those so the developers know what I'm talking about, and other player will understand I'm not trying to "demonize" the game by no mean)\n\n-Lobby sucks, no really they do, they offer great amount of information and it's super user friendly, but they are missing lots of options. To my understanding you need the full version of the game to change some of the settings, but they don't tell you "you can change this one, but you need  X dlc to change that other one" they expect you to spam your mouse click and find out what's working. I don't like it, the lobby system need a revamp, structure wise no so much, but definitely function wise and we need more information.\n\n-The "open microphone" is terribly annoying, there is pros and cons to this function, but so far, after tabula rasa, all point bulletin then APB:Reloaded, after rainbow six : siege beta, comon if you build game you must be a gamer, if you are a gamer you already know other companies tried the open mic thing and it's not working, this is not real life and people do things they would not do in public while they are in front of their computers. I don't want to hear a guy beating his wife or farting or sniffing a line of coke while the match is loading because of the open mic.\n\n-9 times out of 10 the camera angle is great.  However, when it's wrong, it's hella wrong man... The jump shot and most of the trick shot are super sketchy to do, not because of the difficulty, but mostly because of the added difficulty thanks to the camera angle. In a video game, where you can't move your head around and inspect evereything, I expect they woud put some kind of arrow in the air to help you see where the ball will land after a jump shot. Keep in mind you can press "O" in the game to activate the "overhead view" which is great and fixing a lot of problem you could have with the game camera.","December 8, 2015","true","16.9"," 26 of 37 people (70%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","70","26","37","3","0"

I never got round to writing a review for it because it wasn't a GOTY or a flop. It was a niche game with quite a nice gameplay.\n\nPool Nation FX takes Pool Nation and adds several bits to it which Pool Nation didn't have but could have done well with.\nStraight off the bat, a new game has been added: Snooker. The other game modes from Pool Nation are still in FX but so far I can't find 8 Ball UK (which is red and yellow and a 2 shots rule), but 8 Ball is merely cosmetic seeing as rules are now customisable.\nMenus are suspiciously like Codemaster's DiRT Rally but are more clear to navigate than Pool Nation's.\n\nFX is currenty in Early Access which may be a concerning factor, however this does mean that they can do some things which are a bit off. The contols aren't as smooth and nice to handle in Pool Nation (I'm surprised why they didn't copy and paste the controls). Vibration of controllers doesn't actually work. All the icons are for the Xbox One controller (even though both the Xbox 360 and Xbox One controllers are XInput as far as PC is concerned) meaning that users of the "old" Xbox 360 controllers might be confused.\n\nIf you liked the first Pool Nation, FX is for you. If you thought the first Pool Nation was a little lacking, FX fills in the spaces. If you didn't play the first Pool Nation, take a look at FX if you're into Pool/Snooker.","October 7, 2015","true","11.8"," 27 of 39 people (69%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","69","27","39","5","7"

The controls are intuitive, the visuals are very impressive, and the new modes are very welcome. Only two real problems with this game, you have to tinker a bit with the graphics to get it to run smoothly, and two which is sorta minor is that they don't list the challenges for each particular match in the pause menu like they did in the original. This is really annoying when you forget them, but it's minor. I think the worst thing the developers could have done to this game is make it free-to-play. This invites the stereotypical freeloading gamers who think they're always entitled a completely free game and review the game negatively.  This is not how commerce works, so get over it! It's a great game for what it is, and ignore the majority of the negative reviews because they don't even bother to review the game itself.","December 10, 2015","true","2.0"," 20 of 29 people (69%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","69","20","29","7","0"

In my Early Access review of\nPool Nation FX I'll try to convince you that in this\ncase the choice is easier like never before in the\nwhole Early Access games history.\n\n\nLOVE POOL...\nThe pool love story all begun in the biblical Garden\nof Eden where Adam and Eve were happily potting\nunder a cherry tree very first balls. Yes, it was all\nabout cherries from the beginning. And then God\nsaid: "You can pot every ball except the apple-red\none and you'll be enjoying the game of pool for the\nwhole eternity.". But as soon as God left, Eve lost by\nher own desires potted the THAT ball, just because\nit matched her lips (she was eating strawberries for\na moment before). Since then we have to pay\nmembership's fees in our pool clubs while we\nlight-heartedly could play whenever we wish to\nunder every cherry tree in the world...\n\n\nLOVE POOL NATION...\nReleased in 2013 first instalment of Pool Nation\nwas true revelation. After years of waiting since I\nguess late '90 or even more ancient times of Age\nof Amiga we finally got a true, uncompromising\npool simulator, Pool Nation. It was honest attempt\nbuild on real code-craftsmanship without any help\nof big brands or names. Just a group of brave\nenthusiasts realising their bright vision. They\nmanaged to achieve the impossible - combining\nthe perfect gameplay experience with stunning\ngraphic. Since then Pool Nation maybe isn't only\npool game on Steam any more but still is leaving\nany competition far behind and now we even got\nthe sequel, Pool Nation FX.\n\nOne could wonder whether creating a sequel has\nany sense or that the developers can make it\nsignificantly different to give Steamers owning\nPool Nation reason to buy Pool Nation FX. We all\nknow how it ends in other sport games franchises,\nyear after year only few cosmetic changes, small\nupdates here and there and here you go "dear"\ngamer, a receipt for a "new" game.\n\nI must admit, I was really afraid. I'm with this\nfranchise since the beginning and had a lot long\nhours of fun through last two years but it also\ncreated even more expectation towards\nPool Nation FX. What made the matter worse for\nme, it was Early Access. I simply don't buy ANY\ngames released in this way. But I've already seen\nwhat Cherry Pop team is capable of and had that\nstrange feeling of the need to believe in them. The\nfact that Pool Nation FX needs Early Access mostly\nfor developing/adding even more features that it\nalready has became the decisive break I needed\nto buy it.\n\nWhen I first time launched it I experienced\nsomething truly wonderful. That evening I intended\nonly to check it out, adjust some settings... but it\nwas impossible. For almost four hours I was fighting\nwith this game, it hugged me so strong and didn't\nwant to let me go:D. It was like a Christmas, those\nvery first ones you remember from your childhood.\nEvery piece of main menu was like yet another\npresent box you were opening with blushes on your\nface and there was so many of them!:).\n\nThey really did it! Our beloved developers from\nManchester made Pool Nation FX much, much more\nbetter simulator than ever has been seen and since\nit's Early Access it represents Cherry Pop's\nteaminvitation for full of attractions journey\nthrough Poolchester in luxurious VIP compartment.\nYou might ask what they could possibly do more?\nWhat could be done more in game of balls and cues?\nThe answer is: a lot. Of course I'll try not to\nrob you now from the chance to experience as much\nas possible of it for yourself - the precious\nthing about new game.\n\nThe Pool Nation FX's biggest asset is naturally\nbrand new game engine. Unreal Engine 4 makes all\nthe difference for game's mechanic and looks. It\nwas brilliant move, perhaps even Top 10 of the\nbest decisions of Cherry Pop studio's history,\none not far away from founding the company itself.\nBuilding such specialistic game type like\nsimulator requires solid grounds and\nUnreal Engine 4 provides them with no doubt.\nPicking new engine allowed not only fulfil all\nthe current ideas and gave balls more freedom but\nalso it left a window of opportunities opened for\nfuture development.\n\nWhen it comes to games with brilliant gameplay,\nespecially the simulators, visuals really don't\nmatter. But... how possibly one could skip it in case\nof Pool Nation FX? You remember like I was writing\nthat Cherry Pop achieved something impossible\n(ok, at least almost impossible;)? Normally it\nends in making a harm to gameplay or visuals, very\nrarely those two "elements" are mixed in even\nproportions. The certainly impossible part is that\nPool Nation FX is made in a way of classic,\nperfectionist, oldschool times. Pool Nation FX\nsimply looks so lovely! Realistic balls,\nmagnificent cloth (ah those charming zooms)...\nJust look at the screens or clips... You just have\nto see it in action. Such fantastic masterpiece\npainted with high quality textures bewitches with\nits very classy kind of beauty. It's hard to\nbelieve that all data files of this game weights\nless than a half of the weight of files from the\nfirst Pool Nation (SDD enthusiasts standing\novation for Cherry Pop please;), multi-TB HDDs\nowners please stop boo-ing;)) and we're getting a\ngame so many times better than its predecessor,\nyay!:) And with all those crazy high resolutions\nand no FPS lock there's so much place for even more\nvisual magic. There's quite a lot options too (in\nstill increasing number), not only graphic ones but\nalso those such as FOV, Cue Distance, 2 camera types\n(manual and TV) etc..\n\nOf course Pool Nation FX isn't bug free, but hey it's\nbarley a week in Early Access and honestly there\ntruly isn't nothing worth of mentioning. All modes\nlisted above on Steam Store page are working fine\nand eventually encountered bugs are just details\nand definitely not disturbing ones. Plus\nCherry Pop team is extremely devoted in making this\nsimulator better with every day.\n\n\nBE PART OF POOL NATION...\nI simply can't find a single reason to not to enjoy\nthis title from the beginning of its existence. Early\nAccess games always are a certain risk, but you,\ndear fellow Steamer have to look at Pool Nation FX\ndifferently. By owning it now you not only will be\nable to enjoy highest class addiction but you'll also\nbecome a part in history of this one and only, the\nbest pool simulator on this planet. There's other\nthing too. Pool Nation FX needs you, yes you!:), me\nand many others to become the ultimate solution for\nall our pool needs. Your input dear fellow Steamer\nis so important because will help to make this\nsimulator our game. Everyone can leave in this piece\nof code ones mark. Participation in Early Access\ndoesn't reduce itself to reporting bugs. You're\nbecoming a tool (in a positive way;) ) which helps\nto sculpts the future of digital pool.\n\nGemma, Brad, Matthew, Mike are people on a quest.\nThey aren't typical developers team.

I'm\nsure as true pool fanatics they'll never forfeit\nthe fight, but they need us, they need our support,\nour faith.\nI deeply believe in them and you?\n\n\nLOVE POOL...\nLOVE POOL NATION...\nBE PART OF POOL NATION...","October 17, 2015","true","86.5"," 19 of 29 people (66%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","66","19","29","2","1"

So eh, I said  to myself why didn't I try to play by myself and review this thing?\n\nA bit background info, I have never had any real Pool (IRL) experience except some fun games with friends, so I can't say from professional's point of view about how the physic or ball movement or rules work.\n\nFor this price point (approx 8-9 USD in my region), you get a pretty pool game graphic-wise, both offline and online experience, daily quest and the standard controller support, Steam Cloud + Achievements + Cards. Pretty much fair considering you can choose so many modes in addition like:\n\n- You can play campaign/career mode against AI,\n- Endurance mode where you try to slot in the balls faster than the game puts in your table,\n- Free practice mode (9 balls, 8 balls etc) - recommended if you want to get a feel of the ball or shooting practice,\n- Versus mode (hotseat) to play against your friend next to each others,\n- Online mode\n\nThe control is nice and easy even for pure amateur like me. There's a tutorial to help you understand the game and AI is adjustable so you don't get smashed and fall into despair pit when you play the game for the first few hours.\n\nPerformance wise, I slide up everything to max and I still get silky smooth experience on my toaster-like laptop (5200u + 840m). There's an annoyingly long loading times every time you enter new match or load up the game but I'm sure it's fixable by adding up SSD for the game files (I'm using the good old SATA). The game doesn't give good impression when you alt+tab to do something else though, as it actively consumes your CPU's power. Not sure if this is Unity behavior or just the game being poorly optimized  in this regard, as another Unity game like Teslagrad sleeps just fine in background mode.\n\nFor the sound aspects, frankly my personal preference is to play this game without sound except the balls bouncing against each others, but the default in-game sound roster is not bad. Not memorable, but not bad. For this type of game it's the gameplay that matters most, but maybe it's just my personal taste.\n\nDevelopers seem to take a good care of this game and put an effort into fixing things. I personally had crashes that I reported to them when playing but it looks like it got patched and my issue is now non existent. At least unlike many developers who abandon their game, this one doesn't look like one.\n\nAll in all, the game is ok - fun to play even for pool noob like me. I can't say this is the best pool game ever, as I haven't even played THAT many pool games, but yeah, it's a nice game to play.","May 8","true","13.0"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

I play Pool alot on a miniclip app on my mobile. And this is kind of the same except a PC version meaning better graphics. There is the downside of the 'Free to play' part though. It's free to play pretty much nothing. You can play the game without spending a penny. But you'll be stuck in practice mode playing against yourself. Because as far as i could work out you can't play against AI. Meaning to play with friends you'll need to buy the Access all area online addon. Which is £2.69. Nothing really. But i'd rather they just put the game up for £5 and give me access to everything. It does have Snooker though, which is a bonus for me. As me and my friend play it alot now. Although simply for the fact this isn't Free to play i'm going to have to not recommend this.

Beatiful graphics. (If you can run Witcher 3 on medium, you will be able to see all the beauties of Pool Nation FX. People complaining about performance should go and update their PCs at last).\n\nBut do not treat Pool Nation FX as a free-to-play game. Think of it as of $8 game and do not judge it without buying two «Access All Areas» DLCs. Without them Pool Nation is just a poor demo to check graphics and controls. The controls, by the way, is OK most of the times.

(on 980GTX / 660GTX and 540M (Mobile)\n\nControls:\nControls are great. Reason for giving this a 9/10 is due to the 'console' generation of controls and GUI which could have been a lot easier to navigate through. Would still love to know how to access my 2 shot replays (lightening bolts) otherwise the rest of the controls are well documented.\n\nAudio:\nThe audio quality is perfect but the reason for this being 4/10 is the limited midi instrumental soundtrack which gets a bit monotonous after a while and for me, personally, there is a female laugh which cycles every 10 seconds or so which also gets a bit grinding after while. These individual volumes are all adjustable and you can always run mediaplayer with your own beats.\n\nGameplay:\nThere is only so much the game of pool can really offer yet the developers have created heaps of different content from trickshots, multiplayer live matches to career mode. Personally, I will still play ocassionally with mates but doubt I would ever hit the 50 hour mark.\n\nDeveloper Commitment:\nTo be honest, I have never seen a developer more involved in the 'Negative Review' community than Cherry Pop.\nThis however can also be their biggest problem.\n\nX-Factor:\nWhere to start...\nAn over committed dev ('we listen to the community' style) has both positive and negative attributes.\nMaking this a F2P game was a mistake. It just doesn't fit the model of a successful F2P game.\nObviously this was adopted to increase the database of online players to counter-act complaints of 'servers are dead' by game purchasers. We all know that the development of a game costs ... yet for some reason its always the F2P that write all the negative reviews ... These should be labelled 'Demos'.\n\nWould I purchase at this very moment 13/01/2016?\nNo probably not.\n\nIf you take the dev/community out of the equation, I would definately buy this game again without hesitation.\nAs of right now it seems the F2P version would be the better choice if you enjoy a casual game of pool.\n\nSeems like the developers are pretty much unlocking everything besides online play in F2P version.\nA positive is the fact that a F2P can access all the content when playing with a game purchaser.\nI'm interested to see what transpires here wrt dev vs community interaction.\n","January 12","true","12.1"," 14 of 23 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","14","23","0","6"

There's a short answer to that question: absolutely (with a few annotations regarding improvements).\n\nFirst of all, the game is not hard to play if anyone is worried about that, as the controls are quite simple, yet sufficient for cueing with more precision. Truly anyone can learn to play pool with this game. Secondly, the graphics are beautiful (if your pc can handle the game at the maximum settings of course, although the system requirements aren't really demanding). The locations in which you're able to play are stunning and decorated in great detail to fully immerse you into the setting. There are numerous cues, ball sets and even decals to choose from (if unlocked through playing the game), wich give you the ability to personalise your game. Great lighting effects and realistic sounds add even more to this emuneration.\n\nI need to mention, however, that there's still room for improvement. When the ball(s) have been cued the edges of the ball(s) seem to deform slightly when looked at from a (greater) distance. It may be due to anti-aliasing, I'm not sure about that. Besides, it would be great to have a few more camera angles to play with aside from the two that are currently available. The physics could be better as well, as it nearly seems as if the balls roll across a grass surface rather than a table. The balls seem to come to a halt too soon, but I might be wrong about that.\n\nMy overall opinion about this game is very positive, especially when you take the fact into consideration that the game is still in the alpha stage. Keep up the good work and try to fix the bugs and alterations I mentioned before, please :)","October 24, 2015","true","4.4"," 15 of 25 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","15","25","0","0"

Its very basic with the exception of the wonky shot modifications. They have some sort of cash system that looks like it was thrown together overnight and can only buy things that were already included in my copy of the game. There is some single player mode which is very boring. Occasional crashes and an odd bug here or there but this is a mostly functional game.\n\nOverall if you arent looking for anything more than a basic online pool game this might satisfy you. For me it just feels... unfinished.\n\nNote: Finally sank an 8-Ball on the break. 8-Ball gets reset like nothing happened.

If you liked Pool Nation, this is that, with a new engine, better graphics, new music, additional snooker mode *that I know we wanted in the original*.\nSome complain about day 1 DLC, usually I would agree, but this is pure cosmetic, and can be unlocked for IN GAME money. So if you really do not want to buy the DLC don't, I did and do not regret it, but as I said, it is unlockable.\nSome gripe that some features were promised in the original, I am not recalling that exact promise, but I know it was something to look for *in the future*, and here it is.\nI think a updated release is well justified here, and I am quick to burn Devs for re-releasing without real progress, but I think this is real progress.\nI *dispise* early access, and buy very few games that are early access. This game is a fully working game, with in progress development, and THAT is the right way to do early access, so Cherry Pop gets my money and approval.\nOn top of all this, both Pool Nation and Pool Nation FX are quality products with value pricetags. Nobody should be complaning on that level. Please keep up the good work Cherry Pop, and gloss over the sour notes of some, but do listen to valid concerns and suggestions.","October 11, 2015","true","83.7"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","10","17","0","0"

It obviously has some bugs that need to be worked out, but don't be too quick to judge it. It play it casually with my friends, I don't take it too seriously, and I have fun every time. I'm only writing this review because honestly, it needs some more positive ones. I was shocked when I looked into the negative reviews to find someone complaining that the game is "pay to win". That statement couldn't be farther from the truth in my opinion. The only thing you pay for in the game is customization (which there is a fantastic amount of), and it's all payed with using in game currency. Just off the top of my head, there's probably  6 or 7 different game modes which are all fun in their own way, with the classics like snooker, 8 ball, and 9 ball being my favourite. Having just partook in my first tournament after reaching 24 hours in game, and playing against certain friends, I can also say that there's a fantastic amount of variety in player skill that you can come across playing the game. Lastly, only being an occasional pool player IRL, I can't vouch for the physics, and I can't knit pick them and tell you how bad they are, because I honestly whouldn't know. (Oh, and the upcoming patches sound like they're going to improve the game even further, and make it even more enjoyable).\n\nSo, if you're looking for a solid, rather customizable pool experience to casually play with some friends, and have a good time doing so, for a relatively fair price, pick the game up and give it a shot.","January 10","true","35.8"," 15 of 27 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","15","27","0","0"

If you loved Pool Nation you will love this. The handling is essentially the same. I was able to jump right into online mode without problems. Best pool sim I've ever played. So far no technical problems. I have no idea why this is not rated better. Keep up the good work and to many more great updates. Congrats to Cherry Pop Games.\n\nThe only thing I am missing is the cool music of its predecessor.

( default online games are $0 to enter and $25 if you win ) and you can place bets for more money if you want, the graphics are beautiful. there are losts of different cue's and balls and tables to unlock and they are very nice. some are free already and then you use your money to buy stuff. you can practice to your hearts content and the physics and shot lines are very good. very fun game to play. i plan on buying stuff with real money because i want to support these people, excellent game!! and you can use a controller if you want+++. P.S. my only complaint is that when playing online there is a shot time period that doesnt give much time to figure out, and do what you want to do. maybe its different in some different game modes like league and torniment i dont know at this point, but just basic play online there is a "shot time". i assume they do this so people dont sit there forever doing whatever. but if they would just employ a system that allows you to " contest " a shot that is taking forever, meaning if the other person for whatever reason doesnt do anything for a time, then you can " contest " it and if the other person doesnt respond in a short period of time then you automatically win the game.","January 10","true","32.1"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","0"

The controls are excellent.  They're responsive and intuitive, yet they still require some precision to pull off the perfect shot.  Let me put it to you this way, I haven't yet been able to blame the controls for missing a ball.  The graphics on the table are great.  I do raytracing as a hobby, and I still think the balls look raytraced.\n\nThe menus navigation is a little unorthodox, but once you figure it out, it's quite easy.

Would be worth getting the full version if I keep on playing. The Unreal Engine certainly makes this game seem pretty hyperrealistic. And that's a major plus in my book. The gravity physics for the ball movement is pretty spot on so it really adds to the realism. Really competitive for your friends to play against you. So I give this game a thumbs up!\n\nMy only suggestion would be is if you guys could add real-time games going on around the player's current game. I know that's what spectate is for but it would just be something cool to see and make the environment feel more lively and realistic.

That's really something these days. The ball physics, table speed, lighting, menu system, viewing options have all be changed to improve the game.\n\nIn my opinion this is really the best snooker sim/game I have ever played on the PC.

They added people in the background Too. Which makes me realize. That I'm a life less pool stick... So that got me thinking. It would be cool if you could walk around these areas with players. while others play pool. Also make bets. So yes this is a good game and I think you should try out the demo.

If I had picked up the game now in its free-to-play state, I probably would have posted a frustrated review like many others have and given up on the game. But, after some time, the gameplay becomes second-nature and is well worth a bit of patience and practice.\n\nThere have been issues, the odd bug here and there, but Cherry Pop have addressed the ones that bother me.\n\nI've recently started playing more online and it's great to see so many people in the Pool Hall now. Most of them are playing the free 8-ball mode, but that's fine by me. It's all good fun.\n\nIf you like Pool or Snooker, give Pool Nation FX a go. I love it.

I Played it quite a bit there. Having just discovered Pool Nation FX is here on Steam,  I have to say I was surprised.  After trying the Steam version for a little while I can say that overall the games are pretty identical. there are a few changes here and there but nothing that really jumped out at me. The game itself is one of the only free pool games I have had fun with in recent memory. Visually the game looks really nice, and gameplay wise it is easy to learn.\n\nThe only thing I can complain about at all really is that I feel the billiard ball physics are a little janky sometimes. your shots can often go in strange directions or more commonly just be way more powerful or weaker than intended. I feel like the game does a poor job at that. Still, I would recommend Pool Nation FX to anyone looking for a free pool game to try.","December 8, 2015","true","2.4"," 12 of 23 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","12","23","0","0"

Sorry but i think this is wrong. PNFX is not an Simulation - it is a funny Sports Arcadish Game with poor physics but awesome good graphics, shiny balls and good looking locations. The good graphics is ok when you like it, but in reallife you will never see this kind of effects.\nSince the change of the pricing model you can play for free with the lite version, this is a good decision by the dev's.\nTo unlock all areas of the game you can purchase some bundles or purchase the full version.\n\nWhen you will play a funny sports arcadish game with bad physics but good graphics then purchase this game.\nWhen you are a huge fan of Pool/Snooker and you LOVE simulate a real pool/snooker table on a PC then spend no Money for this game. You can check out a REAL Pool/Snooker Simulation here on Steam.\n\nGood luck for further development.","December 20, 2015","false","19.9"," 25 of 49 people (51%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","51","25","49","2","9"

So the play is fluid , Once you get used to the speed. The draw strength seems very low, and needs boosting a bit to make it to feel better.\nThis may be because of the leveling system with in the game. I have not played enough to use the higher cues. So maybe with experience points you get better realism. If this turns out to be the case, then this is a bit sad. In real life better cues do not hit harder, or change the way the balls hit each other. More expensive cues have better tips for more control. This should be what you get when you purchase a better cue in game.\n\nLack of keybindings is a huge miss. I cannot adjust the butt angle because of my mouse driver not being recognised as middle mouse button. Yes I can change the mouse binding, but tbh, I will wait for a fix and play something else for now. Having played pool nation extensively, I know what to expect enough to not have to put the effort into it.\n\nBiggest negative I can see though is the view distance. Or rather big lack of it. The view distance needs to be increased massively. Having to use overhead view on distance shots just kills the realism in the game.

A large portion of the background animations have been removed, which has greatly improved the game. The balls now move with great fluidity, without the need of reducing the quality of graphics to the point the balls started to look square. This has had a consequential effect on the AI, which no longer performs a rather obscure lining up ritual: aiming for the ball to be hit, veering wildly in another direction, wait for about 60-90 seconds, whereupon it would then realign with the original ball.\n\nI am disappointed though that all the cues, ball sets and decals have been unlocked, as it was fun trying to win the money to unlock them. Now there seems little point in winning money; unless there is some gambling possibility in multiplayer; I don't know because previously the game lagged so badly, I feared my latency would get my @ss kicked from Hawaii to Japan because of the embarrassing length of time it would take to make my shot.\n\nThank you Cherry Pop 8)\n\n\nIf the devs would only optimise this game so it didn't run like a sloth on mogadon, then it might be okay, but as it is, the completely pointless animations and graphics going on behind the table really slow the game down on higher settings; and even on lower settings there's no real fluidity to the ball physics.\n\nI really don't know why they put all that rubbish in. Pool Nation ran like a sloth on PCP, and was a dream to play. But this, as it stand, is really a poor successor.","December 9, 2015","true","11.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

So why are you still reading this review?

Next gen pool gaming is here.\n\nF2P Review\n\nThe F2P version has an online mode, a daily challenge, and a daily trick shot challenge. The career mode and a couple other game modes are left out in the free version. Essentially what you are getting in the f2p mode is online play. When you win a match you get money. With the money you can buy cosemtic items like new balls, pool cues, etc. The game itself is pretty well made. The physics work the way you expect it to and there's a ton of advanced techniques you can do. The visuals of the game are amazing outside of the human models that look very plain. As for the funess. This game is only fun if you enjoy pool. There's just nothing in the game that makes it appeal to people outside of the target audience. So if you like pool this is a great game for you. If you don't like pool check it out if you want, but it's exactly what you'd expect it to be.","December 7, 2015","true","0.7"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","9","19","0","0"

Now that I have it, and have played it for a few hours, I highly recommend this game.  It's a beautiful game (no surprise there).  I love that they added people in the background milling around the venue while you play.  I had to chuckle that there is a TV going on in the background and they are showing Pool Nation on it.  The control scheme is smooth.  I also love the new tournament aspect.  In the original game, you had a string of players that you played through to make the title match of a tourney.  In FX, it's done in the fashion of a tournament tree, so you can see how the other players made it to that point.  I like that feel.  There isn't much else to say, really.  It's a pool game.  If you like pool games, then Pool Nation is one of the best that I have played.  They do it better than about anyone.  FX doesn't disappoint.  The price point is very reasonable, too.  I can see that I'm going to sink a lot of my future free time into this one.","November 5, 2015","true","8.9"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

The upside is that if you buy the full version you get everything with any design that is avaliable in the game with the balls, tables, cities, day/night and cue sticks.. tons to choose from. Also an AI league tournament if your wanting to do those and some AI's are just not challenging enough, but a good start to understand the game. The chat window is there for everyone (free or full version), but I have a hard time taking it down when I want to, I have it set to do that, but I always have to figure out the correct button on my keyboard. The free version is quite limited and also doesn't give you much to choose from regarding what I mentioned above. Not that costly either, the graphics are just awesome.\nThe downside is, people will often jump over many balls, swerve too much and in one shot, in reality this won't happen and I hope this game is tweaked a bit more towards reality than other players doing whatever in 1 shot just to get to their ball.\nOverall I would recommend this game, it also has it's own in-game music and plays randomly for whatever it offers (all music is instrumental only, but still awesome).","April 14","true","88.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The free version is VERY limited. It's basically just a demo where you can't do much but sample what the full game would be like. Theres a curency system in the game that lets you make a little money (around $2000 per day?) but honestly I'm not going to play for 5 days to unlock something when my initial experience is what it was.\n\nAs for the game itself, if you like playing pool video games this one looks really great. It shows where the path of the ball as well as the path of the ball that you hit... but this feature also some limitations:\n\n1) It doesn't show the distance of the two very well.\n2) If you bank the ball off the rail, it doesn't show the path for the ball you hit.\n3) If the ball you hit hits another ball, that path isnt shown (so a break shot, which should have tons of paths, doesn't show much)\n4) Making the ball move the way that you plan is nearly impossible since you have to hit it very precisely. Adding spin (side to side) and english (forward and backwords) is almost useless. If you know how it works you don't need it and if you don't you wont be able to pull it off every time.\n\nOverall, the auto-aiming-path-thing tells you what you should already know and it doesn't help you learn how to do trickier shots.

I have been practicing on novice for now, but getting ready to play without the guides (I prefer to have no aid whatsoever... I just need the practice, lol).  Online is still a problem, as it can't find other people to play, but soon they're adding the Pool Hall, which will make it loads easier.\n\nI only post reviews for games that I truely like, or impress me.

I always turned the aiming aid off in the original Pool Nation and Native Rift Support is so huge to be able to look closer to the table and see depth in your shots. I had some graphical issues with it, but I haven't done much for configuration yet and my current graphics cards aren't the greatest plus I'm sure it will get better. The only thing that could make this better is motion controller support (something like glove controllers like ControlVR probably closer to ideal, though not out yet but two Hydra controllers can do). Loved the original and with the Rift this can be 100x better.\n\nAlso the extra amount of customization offered in this game is certainly a plus, though the ability to call every shot (balls, pockets, combos, and rails) in 8 ball or other games would be great. If it is too hard to implement like that, a manual honor system with end turn and foul (scratch) buttons could allow anyone to call their shots and play their own rules. This game was already good and is getting even more realistic (even people sitting at a table and chatting in the background) which has even helped a little on a real table.

Pool Nation FX introduces a more robust and challenging set of aiming mechanics, vastly improved graphics, and online competition.  It also features the triumphant return of Snooker, my personal favourite way to play pool.  Snooker has largely been ignored since the glory days of Virtual Snooker on Windows 95, and I'm glad Cherry Pop decided to feature it in this next installment.  I'm also glad to see some NPCs hanging around the venues to make things feel more realistic, instead of feeling like I'm stuck in someone's incomplete virtual reality program.  Still, they should be interacting more with the player.  I wouldn't mind some tournament backdrops with an audience.  Pool Nation FX sticks to the down and dirty basics of pool, but it needs some dynamic atmosphere to really make it come alive.  The music is better than the original, though nothing spectacular.  Who else wants a custom soundtrack option to be able to play pool with their own playlist?  Are you listening, Cherry Pop?\n\nIn Early Access form, I feel that some things could be refined, most notably the mouse aiming.  It can feel a little sluggish when lining up a shot, and I wouldn't mind being able to scroll back a bit more for a better view.  Does it kill the gameplay for me?  Absolutely not.  But I think the original control scheme was far more swift.  There are a lot of modes to play, tournaments to enter, and online bouts to keep you entered for hours.  Pool Nation was a step in the right direction towards becoming the world's foremost billiards simulator.  I want to see Cherry Pop perfect the FX version even more than they have.  No resting on laurels!

Hyper-realistic scenes and tables bring it to life utilizing the Unreal Engine 4.  There are many stages, times (day, mid, nite) cues, tables, and balls to choose. Playing in overhead mode brings back memories of playing old shockwave/flash based games.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good game of pool. There is also a sandbox mode where you can mess around with ramps, loops, fire rings, etc.  The only problem I have with this game is the absence of button mapping.  I would like to allow key assignment to my mouse and other macro buttons.","October 11, 2015","true","3.4"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

First of all it doesn't feels like an early access game.\nOkay, i had 2 crashes so far, and it doesn't run very well on my wooden pc, and ther's a few things that you can't start (yet) but things can improve.\nAnd they have improved a lot since the first game (which was good already)\n\nPro:\n+Controls are the same. Because it was good in the first game, so why change it?\n+Balls feels a bit heavier, thus the game feels more realistic.\n+Maps are filled with life. There are people walking and talking in the background. The NPCs using different cue etc etc..,.\n+There's a career mode where you can earn money, and you can spend it on different ball sets, cues, and pool table decals. It's so much more exciting to buy the ball set that you want, than just randomly earn it, like in the first game.\n+You can play snooker..... actually i don't like snooker, but still, you can enjoy that.\n+The multiplayer is so much better. You can easily find/host/watch games.\n+You can bet in game money when you are playing online, so it can spice up the games a lot. :D\n\nCon:\n-You have to reach a certain level, to play online without aiming ads. With aiming ads it's basically first mistake=lose so it's pretty boring. But once you reach lvl 20 (if i remember correctly) you can play without aiming ads.

Feels like an Xbox One Port. The graphics are nice but if you're someone who doesn't want to use a Xbox controller or doesn't even own one for a matter of fact, this game really isn't for you. I can't tell you how many times I miss my shots because of the crappy mouse controls of pull back, lock in, push forward, causing the aim to turn a little. You're suppose to hold left click and push forward, but even that's busted.\n\nI own Pool nation, the original and loved it. PC controls were spot on, didn't make it feel like a console port. This game came off as a cash grab. Cash in on people who want a free pool game and who might stay, spending a few bucks here and there. The game is decent, but you have to pay for the good stuff.\n\nWith the PC controls being lackluster and most of the good games behind a paywall. I have to vote no on the game. But if you use a controller and don't mind paywalls, check the game out. Or just buy the Original Pool Nation. Many people still play it online and it has a way better control scheme, or at least more responsive.","December 7, 2015","false","0.2"," 18 of 42 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","18","42","0","0"

This game is half-a55 and frustrating. If you have ever played pool in real life just spare yourself the agony and buy a different game.\n\n1) you scratch on break: re-rack and computer breaks. Computer scratches on break: you get ball behind the line (you can still shoot at any ball on the table tho). You scratch at all during the match and CPU gets ball in hand anywhere on the table. CPU scratch you get ball behind the line.\n\n2) bottom english - straight shot; cue follows object ball into pocket (what in the illegitimate fxck?!). No matter what power your shot, if its a straight shot cue ball follows object ball. Its all messy.\n\n3) So limited on view options that it hurts. You can be right up on the cue ball or overhead view and everything else is a lie. When you are up on the cueball (view) the camera follows the stick when you change angles. You have an absolute shxt view of the table.\n\n4) CPU takes FOREVER to shoot. It acts confused moving left and right and finally shoots no matter if its a difficult shot or the object ball is sitting right in the fkn pocket. You can skip watching the shot by right clicking but thats equally annoying because there is no indication that you have skipped the shot til suddenly all the shxt on the table is just reconfigured and CPU is taking next shot. You basically end up mashing right click constantly until its your turn.\n\n5) Cant change the difficulty of the CPU in versus mode. Why? WTF Why?\n\n6) Good luck playing online. Either nobody is ever on there or its broken (maybe both).\n\n7) They call solids 'spots'. Hipsters?\n\n8) On easy have watched the CPU run the table off the break uncountable times. Hard to believe if you ever watch the CPU shoot it seems confused about what its even doing. Put it on medium and the CPU cant make more than 2 shots in a row.\n\n9) You can only set it to call the pocket on the 8 ball? Seriously? How bout every shot? CPU will slop shot you and its extremely annoying.\n\n10) You will get aids and so will your PC","November 21, 2015","false","43.7"," 11 of 28 people (39%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","39","11","28","2","15"

The menus follow suit. Highly unusable and full of questionable decisions.\n\nOn the second thought, forget it.. All you need to know is that the game offers no way to turn off the visual line pointing from your ball to the target ball. No way to make this thing disappear! Or I didn't find it (which is basically the same thing in my book). Maybe it's only in the practice mode, but what kind of practice it is then? It so happens, that I played a lot of pool in my life and I don't friggin remember seing floating white lines that help me aim.

Surprised? No.\n\nThe devs suddenly got silent. Surprised? Not at all.\n\nThey say they listen to our recommendations but they haven't fixed one issue yet after 2 weeks. The voice chat in-game is broken beyond belief. The game crash more often than not. Table speed is soooo slow it's unbelievable that they release this game like that even though they said it was fixed in the Steam version. The cushions were much better in PN, now they feel like wood. I could name at least 5 other game breaking bugs but my time is more valuable than that. Cherry Pop doesn't care so I might as well stop right here because they don't read about their customers concerns and when they finally respond all they say is that they are hard at work on it but nothing ever get fixed.\n\nThe online mode stinks even more than a pile of zombies like in the movie The Walking Dead. The game was dead on arrival so we can't expect a miracle.\n\nEdited 17/11/2015\n\nThe dev say that they have an ACE up their sleeves for populating the online portion. I wonder what it could be...\n\nHow is that ACE going to help thousands of people being online? I don't get it...Let's say their ACE is for the people already having the game but who don't play it because it's boring, will that ACE be capable of remotely control their hand and have them click on the Pool FX icon so the game start? What is that ACE made off? Is this Black Magic?\n\nAnd for the people not owning the game, how is that ACE going to work? Will it send a transcendental message through their computer and have them click on the "BUY" button?\n\nGemma (a dev) keep repeating the same old song over and over that once they launch the game officially, that the game will be populated with enough people to play online on a regular basis but I can't see how SHE will accomplish that. Proof http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=660096589\n\nThe game itself is not that bad...it's the total lack of players online that make this game DEAD. The biggest defender of the game are the ones NOT even playing it on a regular basis and these are the same people who only have 3 to 10 hours played. They defend the game like if it was their own child yet they barely play.\n\nCherry Pop just does not have the resources or talent to promote the game. Avoid this game at all cost.\n\nUpdated; Seems like they just abandonned the game for their new baby Snooker Nation. Then in 4 months, SN will get the same fate. Abandonneware seem to be what this company delivers. Sure they won't say they are neglecting it but it will come quick enough because that's all they keep doing since 2013 ever since they launch PN.\n\nAlso the MP lobbies are empty most of the time so their F2P dream hit them back straight in the face. Good for them and I'm just wishing they go out of business.

It makes no sense and needs to be changed. Also for some reason, a couple times when playing 8 ball online, I will go through all of my balls and hit the 8 ball in and win, but occasionally it says I lost, when I obviously didn't becuase I didn't scratch and the 8 ball went in, but it left both of us wondering how that happened. It is mostly a good game, but there are little things here and there that make it really annoying to play some times.
