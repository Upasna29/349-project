I don't know, but that is the case here. Bugs, glitches, terrible voice acting and vanilla writing mask a large, enjoyable open world, a confusing but rewarding alchemy system, a ton of loot, and enjoyable exploration. I love this game, and when it's on sale it is an incredible value.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dinre/recommended/1930/","dinre","Dinre","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dinre/","393 products in account","Okay, so I have to start my review by admitting I really enjoyed my time playing Two Worlds.  As others have said, the game is fairly glitchy, but as a long-time gamer, glitches don't ruin things for me as long as they are consistent.  In fact, learning to take advantage of those glitches used to be a big part of gaming, and I enjoyed the challenge in Two Worlds.\n\nThe game is pretty standard fare with a male hero seeking to save the hapless female (yawn), and the hack-and-slash gameplay is good.  Go kill some stuff, collect stuff, and do some quests that consist of killing stuff and collecting stuff.  It's nothing special, but I enjoyed it all the same.\n\nThe voice acting is so bad that I actually played with the game muted.  That was a new experience.\n\nI was having fun, exploring the land and doing side quests, and then I discovered something horrible.  Truly horrible.  This is the gamer's equivalent of Lovecraftian Old Ones rising from their slumber to slaughter the denizens of an innocent town...\n\nAfter about 90 hours of gameplay (mostly ignoring the main quest), I discovered that certain tasks in side quests MUST NOT be completed before certain other tasks in the main quest.  Or you break your entire experience.  And the game can't progress.  And there is NO way to fix it.\n\n...\n\nBoo.","February 1, 2015","false","95.6"," 198 of 255 people (78%) found this review helpful 33 people found this review funny","78","198","255","33","18"

I am saying this because with a ton of games available today and so many on sale offers, one may easily abandon a game and go for another.\nWhy I like this game? It is addictive. It keeps you playing for its advantages regardless its flaws. I have a lot of games, games I go back playing like skyrim, games I do not stop until I complete them like shadow of Mordor and games I never start playing yet. Too many games, too few time. Still, two worlds is a game that I start and did not abandon nor I will anytime soon. This game has something strangely addictive. For example I abandon dark souls about mid game while been an excellent game but I am now mid-game at two worlds and I hardy spent this little time to write this, right now I prefer to enter the game and continue.\nTo describe this game very briefly, it is like diablo on levelling and items, like oblivion on world environment feeling and like divinity 2 on movement and combat. It also has some unique gameplay elements on its own.\nWhat you need to know primarily is that tutorial is brief and very basic. This game needs your close attention to understand it. The first time I play I think there were major flaws and bad designs but with a second and third closer careful looks I understand that I was wrong. Once you understand how things work it is where you really get addicted. I am sure that most negative reviews comes from hasty gamers. I do not blame them, a modern game needs to have a proper tutorial, a complex game a large tutorial, this game most likely relies on the manual.\nLet’s get on details(the bad stuff at the end):\nThe character: You only play a male human character, no females and no races. That’s it. Also your starting character is fixed, fixed attributes and fixed starting skills. You cannot start with point pool and boost what you like. However the starting skills are the basic ones and at level 1 of 10. You can level up and increase any you like. All starting skills are all you need to do all essential things and secondary actions. For example you have lock pick 1 and you can lock pick and also increase it for a better chance. You do not have alchemy skill but you can still use alchemy. Finally, playing the game and visit villages and towns will allow you to meet trainers that will teach you the level 1 of all skills eventually, so there is no skill point cost at all for level 1 skill. If for example you want to advance alchemy or water magic you do not start with, all you need is to find the appropriate trainers to get the 1st skill point by paying some money. While levelling you get 5 attribute points and one or two skill points, usually one. You may also get one skill point before you level up but I have not yet figure out when, the game has many good secrets. You can also permanently increase attributes using alchemy even without skill 1, if you find the proper ingredients. In other words the game is rewarding for the good and smart player offering more than the standard gain experience and fixed level up procedure. Two level 10 characters for example may be different, one may be even 40% stronger from extra attributes and skills alone.\nThe gear and items: Items are much like diablo, leveled items and many auxiliary items, consumables and especially ingredients. The only disadvantage here if it is one is that there are too many items. Not just leveled, too many items. Perhaps the greatest variety on gear I have ever seen. Ready consumables are just what is needed. Ingredients are plenty and not only herbs but also parts from animals and various minerals. There are also gems as consumables to add different types of damage to weapons, traps to set, spell cards and spell boosters and few standard items like the teleport stone and quest items.\nOne unique gameplay element here is that you can enhance any gear item, weapon or armor with another piece of item of the same type. Items have a special attribute called ‘class’ which is usually one. If you have a short sword for example and find another one you can drag and drop it one another and you will now have a class 2 short sword which of course is a little better, doing more damage in that case. This is a very good thing and very useful, as it allows you to use trivial equipment to avoid buying everything from the store at every couple of levels or so, or live and die by drop chance alone. For example I used a Grom Shield that happened to be a very common item groms carry and drop so I end up finding about 30 or so, effectively had a class 30 simple grom shield with a parry number high enough to keep me up to level 10 or so. Then there were better shields to buy and enemies no longer often carry that shield, so it was time to change. Spell cards also stack. Add a second and third and so on card of the same spell and the spell becomes stronger, requiring more mana however. Finally gems can be placed on a weapon for extra damage and you can put as many as you like as long as they are of the same type, e.g. rubies that add fire damage.\nMoney and trading: Surprisingly money are always needed here, and the game offers a fair amount of money. The trading is active to this game. You always earn cash and you always have reasons to spent, and not on consumables exclusively. I’d rather say you may spent for making your hero more powerful. Enemies either drop inventory with a fair amount of gold and random items or a single standard automatic pickup, like the wolf drops a wolf heart which is an ingredient.  Anything may drop but specific items have better sources to be harvested and animals and beast always drop standard ingredient item instead of inventory. All except single pickups are level depended, chests, enemy inventories and shops. You are bored looking for ingredients that increase your stats permanently? No problem, pay some attention to mage shops and after a certain level you definitely come across to buy.\nEnemies: Good variety of enemies, large size enemies are really deadly and not level depended, leveled enemies are logical like bandits; they got stronger but not as much as you.\nClasses: The 3 archetypes work well, fighter, mage and archer/thief that is. Hybrids also work well. There is depth on each single archetype, fighting style and weapons for fighters, magic schools for mages and lots of choices to master for an archer/thief.\nThe story is interesting, the world is very good at least. The soundtrack is almost perfect.\n\nNow the bad stuff:\nThe back-jump. Honestly I hated that. In my opinion it ruins melee. I do not even assigned it to a button. The game is much better without. Again, my opinion.\nThe dialogues. Not sure what English dialect that is but it is strange until you get used to it. Also some times are almost childish, some other times are very mature. Your hero speaks quite well though.\nThe NPC characters. Quite average.\nThe spells. They are lots and great and come in form of cards that stack and extra spell booster cards (more damage, less mana etch). However you may have 3 spells with booster cards (that also stack), the others need some special way to be placed on your custom hot bar, first on the spell amulet and then on the hot bar. No big deal but somewhat annoying.\n\n","November 10, 2015","true","101.4"," 103 of 121 people (85%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","85","103","121","5","0"

Great Open world to explore and discover stuff\n2. One of those games that the more you play, the better your guy gets, no cap\n3. Gameplay is fun\n4. Quests aren't repetitive\nCons:\n1. Acting is TERRIBLE\n2. Graphics are not the best, its a pretty old game after all\n3. Quests are annoying at times, like i said, acting is really bad\n4. Can get quite annoying\n\nReason for recommendation:\nWhile the acting is terrible and the quests can be annoying, I personally enjoyed it just cause you can go out and just level up endlessly and the gear has a fun upgrading system, you can get more of the same item and combine them to make it better, but it will still be the same item. So, say you take out a tower, and like every other guy had the same weapon. You can then take all the weapons and combine them together and get a weapon that may just be better than what you're using. Worst comes to worst you can always sell it and not worry about having to carry around 15+ weapons to get your gold. I have always enjoyed a game that has endless upgrading. This one is enjoyable too if you can get past the terrible acting and just do your own thing.","November 19, 2014","true","21.4"," 99 of 118 people (84%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","84","99","118","5","2"

The experience system is nice and even. The skill building is cool. The mobs are varied. The armor upgrade system is awesome. The area looks good and is quite diverse.

But to be honest...just barely!\n+ Huge World to discover and it is open world from the start\n+ Very fast loading screens\n+ It definitely has a certain charm and overall I liked the game\n- There are so many areas you can just ignore because theres nothing to do there. In my personal experience I found the southern part of the map so unpleasant that I just rode my horse past all enemies to get to a certain place as fast as possible.\n\n+ Environments look nice, full of trees, vegetation, wild animals and other enemies. The water looked extremely good for a game that old.\n+ A lot of different enemy types!\n- The environments also look very round and generic, there are almost no rocks or cliffs in this game\n\n+ The cities and villages are filled with many many NPCs\n- All the NPCs look similar and it is hard to recognice those who actually advance the plot.\n- Most of them just say the same thing and are just there to fill the city...useless!\n\n+ Teleporters are scattered all over the map to make travelling faster. Without much loading time.\n- Most of the times the teleporters are also quite far away from where you want to go. I recommend planting a mobile teleporter next to some merchants in one of the cities so you can save some time because you will want to sell your stuff frequently.\n\n+ Merchants have no limited amount of gold, so you can sell them all the stuff you want.\n- Your Inventory has a limit. At some point your strength doesn't increase the carry weight any more.\n\n+ Some of the cities are huge and very impressive\n- They are also too big and you have to run through them to get to an important NPC or merchant\n- Also they lack verticality as there are no towers or walls to be climbed, the hero can also not climb any ladders, they are just for decoration\n\n+ Horses for longer journeys are very useful. They are much faster and you can find them in many places.\n- The controls for horses are very stiff. You will get stuck in trees, rocks and they wont go up or down any steep landslides. Horses do not teleport with you and the function to whistle for your horse is useless when being further than 10 meters away from it.\n\n+ The combat animations look great\n+ There are a lot of different ways to attack: Magic, Bows, Clubs, Staffs, Swords, Daggers, Axes... . Some two-handed and you can dual-wield.\n+ You can enchant your weapons with (an unlimited amount of?) gems of the same type making them more and more powerful. I have literally used all of my fire-gems on one weapon and it was extremely strong and I could add even more fire gems after that.\n+ It is very satisfying to kill an enemy with a two handed club because they will sometimes fly all over the place.\n- It also feels very stiff to fight. You will constantly miss enemies. There is no way of actively blocking an attack (at least I didnt find it).\n- I am sure I am not the only one to be very annoyed by the enemies with bow and arrow. It usually goes like this: Attack a group of enemies, the ones with swords will die first because they are in close combat. The archers are in the background shooting at you. You run at them to kill them. Before you can swing at them they already turned around and ran further away. You run at them to kill them. Before you can swi......x3 I've chased archers across the map like this so many times.\n-The framerate seems to go down during battles\n\n+ A huge amount of different armours and robes, rings and amulets. They can also be stacked when you find identical items. It is very motivating to be on the lookout for better equipment.\n- The high level armours wont allow you to swim, use your bow or dual wield. Why not?\n- There is a river flowing across the world. I wondered: I have an armour which doesn#t allow me to swim. So I ran towards the water and....the hero just walked to the other side of the river...under water! (which is also MUCH faster than swimming!)\n\n+ A large selection of skills to level up. And a lot of different spells.\n- Swimming skill is useless. Don't waste any points on it. There was no situation at all where I was required to swim anywhere.\n- Sneaking skill is useless too, as is pickpocket skill. You wont have any money problems in this game.\n- If you want to use the best armour in the game, don't level up your arching skills, because those armours can't be used with bow and arrow.\n- Horse riding skill is useless. The few times I did use horses I just used them to travel faster and get off them as soon as possible :)\n- There is a skill to de-horse enemies....I have not seen an enemy riding a horse.\n\n+ You can also stack your magic spells to make them more powerful.\n- Projectiles are very slow and will often miss their target when it isn't either standing still or moving towards you.\n\n+ Cool looking creatures can be summoned. They can distract enemies.\n- Summoned creatures are very slow and have no perception of depth. They will miss their swing 9 times out of 10.\n\n+ The music and sound effects are enjoyable.\n- The english sync is horrible! Try to play it in another language. I played it in german and it sounds a lot better.\n\n+The whole world is full of side quests!\n+ Levelling up is fun\n+ NPCs have a lot of dialogue and it's all voiced.\n+ A lot of small stories help to get involved in the world\n- Sometimes I skipped the dialogue because I didnt care.\n- Personally I didn't find the story interesting","December 18, 2015","true","39.3"," 74 of 87 people (85%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","85","74","87","8","0"

Its not just single player, there is a multi player function via network. Even if you want to just play single player, you need to setup a user name and password. I'd say that the game was designed for multi player. Its not just fighting one enemy, but packs of them and they were far too overpowered until I was 4 hours into the game. That's one of a number of bad first impressions I was given.\n\nI was forced to run away and let two packs of enemies kill one another and then I'd loot the corpses. It became part of the game for me. If you're not into combat, you can run by any enemy no matter how large or overpowering they are. Even if a dozen enemies are following you, they'll get bored eventually. You'll always be faster even if there's no run button. You can chose your level of difficulty at the start, but never in the game. I made the mistake of going medium.\n\nThe game has a lot of dialog. In fact some banter between my character and a quest giver bordered on a novella's length. I'd watch the sun rise in the background only to have night fall during the conversation it was so long. The voice acting is stiff, slow and spoken in the old tongue. I can't call it bad voice acting, the voices are memorable, its just the speed, delivery and the "mayhap," "whenst" and archaic words that are no longer used. It was almost a point of comedy until I got used to it. With that being said, I'd rather listen to the dialog than read it. You can hit the space bar to skip each line.\n\nAnother bad first impression was the fact that a lot of the time you're told to do something. Sometimes its marked on your map, other times its stuff like "find these two deserters and kill them." Well where did they go? If I knew that, I wouldn't need you. Even things that are marked on your map can have locked doors preventing you from entering or lock picking. Well where's the key? Oh you won't find that until you stumble upon some quest giver half way across the land. Then he'll give you the key after completing three quests with no sort of hint that he has the key.\n\nA lot of quests, you're given a choice to accept them and it boils down to well do I want to have something to do in the game or not? Yes of course I'll take the quest. In a game with such a giant land, it became a struggle to even find quests. The first town was brimming with quests. Each town does have a few quests, but sometimes they're relegated to one person giving all the quests. Other times you're in giant cities that you really need to go digging to find quests. The game makes it easy though to find who has a quest when you walk by them an icon appears that indicates if they're a typical background character, a quest giver, a merchant or a trainer.\n\nGold felt worthless in the game. I never really bought anything. Everything that I had was from killing one of the hundreds of bandits or thousands of orcs. There was an occassional find at a merchant, but after a while I just stopped browsing their wares and just sold everything to them. A beautiful part about the game is they'll buy everything, they don't have limited funds and they're not picky. Its pretty streamlined. Even your inventory can carry a lot of stuff, and not that many things have a weight to them. I just wish there was a search function. You won't be over encumbered. You just can't pick up something when your inventory is full. It keeps the game moving. Another beautiful thing is you can merge the same weapons or armors to become stronger! It clears space and its interesting, even if it wouldn't happen in real life.\n\nTwo Worlds is big on exploration. one of the biggest joys that I felt was exploring new areas either on foot or on horseback. There are lush forests, bright deserts with rolling dunes, bamboo forests inhabited by horrific arachnids, eerie graveyards and foggy wastelands with twisted trees. The only problem is that 99.9% of it is outdoors. There are still dungeons, but they're few and far between. Not only that, but they feel very sterile and empty. Too perfect and unnatural. Towns have interiors, but its relegated to single rooms and those too are rare. An entire village might have one room for you to enter.\n\nThe land is so vast and large, with dozens of settlements. Everything from humble villages to grand cities you'll get lost in. There are two military camps, dozens of bandit camps, grom camps, mines, a dwarven quarry and gang hideouts. Oh but that's just the north half of the land. The south half is just as big, but instead of humans, every settlement, village and castle is full of orcs. The deserts have their own unique settlements, inhabitants and humanoid monster villages. Its just all so diverse. There's always something new and fresh. Necromancer towers, new enemies, new locales. It kept the game fresh and kept me exploring.\n\nSince the game is so massive, there are teleporters after you complete one of the first few quests. You'll need to find a teleporter to unlock it. Otherwise there are horses to travel faster, but a real problem is that you can't bring a horse into a teleporter. That might make a centaur. I'm very thankful to have the teleporters.\n\nThe orc war is really the backdrop to the game. Its a pressing issue for the people of Two Worlds, but for you, your main goal is to rescue a woman who has been kidnapped. No no not a princess. Your sister. In fact she's one of the few women in the game. I'd say 99% of the game's population is male. More than half of the female populous dies by the end of the game if you fulfill the quests.\n\nEvery dead enemy stays dead. Nothing will respawn. You can go through the entire game and become the only living thing. To shorten some silly long quests, I merely killed two entire villages full of people. They wouldn't let me into their settlement, so I killed the man with the key and everyone attacked me. Even though the game told me that the guards were notified, no one did anything. I was never arrested, nor fined. I could walk through an entire military camp and no one cared.\n\nAnother way that it feels like a MMORPG is when you die, you simply respawn. You'll find several healing ankhs and mana replenishes. If you get low, just stand on them. There is no punishment for death. The only real punishment is wasting time traveling back to where you were. I managed to exploit dozens of big, tough enemies by dying, respawning, striking them twice then dying with one hit. Keep chipping away!\n\nCombat itself is easy and resorts to mouse clicking madness to attack. You've got a quick use toolbar that lets you use keys 0 - 9 to use things like spells and items. Even a quick mana or health recharge. Your three active spells are also in the toolbar. The right mouse button also uses whatever skill you've highlighted in the toolbar. Spells and arrows have lock on aim, which is nice, but you can turn it off if you'd like to miss 99% of the time. There are spell modifiers in the spell menu, things that reduce the cost of mana to doubling their effectiveness. Each spell is basically a card. The more of the same card you have equipped, the more damage it does. Spells felt very ineffective compared to physical melee.\n\nLeveling up gives you five attribute points to sink into health, attack, intelligence and dexterity. The dexterity felt useful, because it raises your attack and defense percentages, but it goes down over time making it feel wasted. You'll also get skill points to sink into several skills, most of which I never used. Skill points even seemed granted at odd times, making me think you get a point for every X amount of minutes played.\n\nWhile I got entertainment out of it for the exploration, I'm not sure that I can really recommend it to anyone else. I was surprised that I endured the first 4 hours. By the last 4 hours I was getting bored again. Its been $1 and free before...","March 6, 2015","false","27.6"," 114 of 152 people (75%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","75","114","152","18","10"

BUGS. HOLY MOTHER OF GOD, THEY'RE EVERYWHERE. It's like an infestation of glitches of every kind: graphical (I'll talk about that later.), gameplay, combat and some are even game-breaking. Walk up stairs,  open a chest, and never walk down the stairs again due to the magical power of floating over noble gasses gained in the 11 seconds you spent raiding the poor farmer's pantry. Luckily, the game keeps a good list of autosaves to avoid these issues.\n\nSecond biggest problem: the visuals are horrendous. I was walking through what I thought was a field of grass and happiness, when suddenly...bamboo. A whole forest of it, and I was walking through the center of the mighty wilds without even noticing. It took the game 10 minutes to process the enviroment fully. I could understand this if you were playing Mass Effect 3 on a Commodore 64, but with these extremely out-dated and pixely graphics, it should take less than 5 seconds on an average non-gaming computer.\n\nOh, and don't bother talking to that drunk guy in Four Stones Village. His voice acting is even worse than the cook in the army camp named Bodlo, wh speaks in 3rd person and has the voice of a pig that was injected with both steriods and female hormones.\n\nWith the bad parts aside, lets talk about why this game is actually worth the $10.00 asking price. Let's be posh and give you a list of blunt statements:\n\n- ALMOST 600 ARMOUR SETS, each with individual pieces: helmet, gauntlets, legs, torso, and boots.\n- 200 different weapons\n- Decent character customization (Though more hair options would be nice, other than just the 12 flavours of short available in 9 shades of brown.)\n- Very easy to pick up and play.\n- Puns of Damage. And lots of them. Some of them are even tolerable!\n- Large open world, with tons of shiny loot, though I wish more of it could be placed in your house...which you can't have.\n\nOver all, the hardcore gamer will find nothing of interest here. Fans of western RPG's will find an interesting mix of complete control over your character's destiny, and terrible, game breaking bugs such as randomly dying when you pick a lock to...\nA TENT?

So far I am 37 hours in and I think it has a Good Story line. The teleport side quest is exceedingly helpful in making sure you don't have to leave any loots behind. Slight lag when it autosaves but otherwise runs smoothly.  Biggest disappointment thus far has been the inability to pickpocket from the NPC's.

Try Gothic 1, then compare games again... or try Arx Fatalis and come back.\n\nTwo Worlds is a grand effort from a small team to try to make a game they'd want to play. A labor of love, so to speak. It's for that reason why I love the Gothic series (especially the third one).\n\nIn Two Worlds, you don't get the feel and controls of a triple A game franchise. You get handcrafted, homecooked, delicious, awkward experimentation from gamers who love games.\n\nRemember Peter Jackson's first few movies? Would it surprise you to know that the guy who gave us all the Lord of the Rings movies started out just making random, insane films, like "Dead Alive" and "Meet the Feebles"? Innovation requires risk.\n\nTwo Worlds does things a bit differently and that's what's worth taking notice of. Sure, horse controls are awkward, and your main character says "Mayhap" and "Perchance" enough times in the first hour to make you want to invent time travel and murder ancient languages... but keep playing.\n\nKeep playing and discover an absolutely massive world with very, very little loading time, and a Morrowind-esque combat system. I dislike the Oblivion comparison because that game was truly real-time and Two Worlds is more die-rolls and random chance based on skill percentages like Morrowind, Dungeons and Dragons, Shadowrun, and... well... 80% of CRPG's that have come out in the last 35 years.\n\nIn summation:\nVoice acting: Bad to the point of comedic.\nCombat: Die rolls... not Oblivion.\nWorld: HOLY COW this thing is huge.\nGameplay: Enough variation to keep me coming back.\nHorses: Not as good as Mount & Blade, but better than Ride to Hell Retribution.\nReplayability: Mayhap I should complete it once before I judge this.\n\nTwo World's Epic Edition is of such quality that I can only compare it to Seth Rogen's "The Interview": A lot of people said a lot of things about it, but when I finally saw it for myself, I realized that people don't really know anything and I should just judge things for myself.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/metalupyourmax/recommended/1930/","metalupyourmax","Phil Collins","http://steamcommunity.com/id/metalupyourmax/","162 products in account","By far one of the most memorable and underrated RPGs ive ever played. This game recieved mostly all negative reviews on release and was hated by most critics. I didn't know any of this before I saw in an EB Games and picked it up for a cheap price on disk.\n\nTwo Worlds is definitely a flawed game. The writing is ♥♥♥♥, with everyone speaking in the old style english language that sounds ridiculous and out of place. On top of the writing is the atrocious voice acting (which is funny). The starting game cutscene even features writing where a character repeats a Monty Pyton quote word for word which is farcical. The devs also decided to use laughable names for certain things in the game, for example calling some sort of plague "The Taint". Two Worlds was also riddled with bugs on release (patched with expansions in Epic Edition) which didn't help at all in the way of reviews. Looking past those issues though, Two Worlds is an enjoyable experience. Reviews on Youtube do great in making this game look like a laughfest of asinine writing and technical flaws, but besides those issues, the game at its core is an ambitious underachiever which still succeeds in providing to the player for the most part.\n\nThe main menu music was the first thing that stood out when I started the game, which complimented the pretty wonderful soundtrack. Two Worlds takes place in Antaloor, a mysterious and expansive setting that always kept me expecting more. I never felt like I was playing a walking simulator (even though the world is huge), nor did I feel like I was being attacked left and right. The game did nicely in striking a balance between a good amount of action and passive adventuring.  Two Worlds also includes a multiplayer component, with PvP and Co-op. I never really played it though because the population was mostly Eastern European, so English was pretty rare. The combination of the two leaves a lot for the player to do. Questing, exploring, looting, messing around, and kicking ♥♥♥ is always an option. The cities are big and populated, and felt very lively. I personally was in love with the variety of awesome armor and weapons, which is what I liked the most.You can also choose how you want to play, throughout the entirety of the game. There are no preset classes or anything, so you can play however you want to. You can play melee the whole game, or be a hybrid archer mage warrior. How you choose to fight is only limited by what you have in your inventory and your skill levels. The combat system is also one of the few ive experienced that actually works. The targeting system is automated which can be troublesome but rarely is it actually. You can't always button mash to win though, since you can easily die, but its satisfying and rewarding. The combat is nothing innovative nowadays, but it works and its fun. I always looked forward to what kind of loot I would find. I would be ecstatic when I would find a new piece of armor that made my character look lawesome. The graphics for it's time were decent at best. Far distance rendered poorly and the textures and effects were pretty basic but taking into account how expansive the world is, with all the different types of environments, it was justified. The armors and weapons did have pretty intricate details though. Even if you had to game maxed out and ran at 60fps plus, it still looked choppy thanks to the animations. Hours can easily be lost in this game when you realize all that there is to do in the game world. If you really choose to, you can hate this game. Two Worlds has quirky dialogs, a poor storyline, weird people, terrible voice acting, questionable sound choices (attacking someone with a sword plays punching sounds?) and ugly animations. To me, these issues were relatively unimportant, which is why I enjoyed the game as much as I did. Two Worlds always had something that allowed me to forgive it for its issues.\n\nSo much in this game can be done in the way of customization and how you want to play. I still consider myself pretty lucky to have given this game a chance and I still remember experiences from 5+ years ago. To add, I can safely say I enjoyed this game just as much as any Elder Scrolls game, which seem to be the standard which any RPG is based on nowadays. Two Worlds lacks polish and is nowhere near perfect, but underneath all of the minor issues, is a gem. A gem of a game that is immensely underrated and misunderstood. Despite all you may read, this game is an immersive and rich experience that can leave you glued to your screen for hours. It's up to you to realize that not every game needs to be technically perfect, its how you appreciate it and your ability to see through the rough edges.","June 29, 2014","true","5.8"," 41 of 48 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","41","48","0","0"

I could write a review equivalent in length to War and Peace if I wished to list fully everything that I wanted to say about this game, so I'll give two versions - one brief and one a bit more in-depth, take your pick.\n\nHere is the short version: Two Worlds EE is Skyrim with Oblivion graphics, there is as much to like about this game as there is to annoy, you need at least 3-4hrs in to start really enjoying it and remember, it's the first game from a small development team.\nThat's the short version. For those who want a bit more info, read on.\n\nI went into this game, on the back of mixed reviews, not expecting a lot from it and was very pleasantly surprised by how much this game has going for it - yes, the graphics are a little outdated today, but it IS still a very pretty game overall  on max settings. Some of the scenery is beautifully breathtaking, but unfortunately pop-in and a fairly short draw distance does ruin it a little. And this is the story through the whole game. For every single thing I loved about this game, there was a downside - usually directly related to the thing I loved (such as the graphics example above). I loved the way the weapon/armour levelling system worked - downside, you never knew which items to keep (as there are literally hundreds  of both) and which to sell. I loved the diverse array of different environments on offer - downside, I spent 5-10mins exploring a new area and then half an hour putting stuff away to keep/save to sell in bulk, as you can build up your strength (helps with carrying), but once your inventory screen is full, you cannot carry anymore regardless of how much spare weight you can manage. I loved the large map, with virtually every environment you could think of in it - downside, there were parts where you wouldn't really have noticed if they weren't there (like empty stretches  of forest/grass/sand etc.) and mountain ranges devoid of everything and only 1 way up. I could go on and on, but you get the point.\n\nThe best features of this game, in my humble opinion, are: Huge range of weapons/armour/enemies; lots of diverse environments (even the dungeons don't seem 'samey' after you've been in 4); Skyrim-like short main questline with lots of 'mini' npc quests; every time I started to feel invincible I encountered a new enemy (they level up with you) who either gave me a damn good fight or made me run off with my tail between my legs (to come back later with better weapons); the ability to play the game as a medieval Rambo, a wizard, an archer (sniper) type or indeed ANY combination of the three at any one time! The best thing loved was the fact that even at 100hrs in, with 90% of the (large) map covered and almost finished all the quests, I was not only not bored and looking at what to play next, but was STILL finding new places and enemies! And it's the ONLY game I've played where walking through snow actually sounds like walking through snow!!! There is more, I could also list a lot more downsides, but basically just (re-) read the short version above and if that appeals to you then this game is definately worth giving it some play time. I'm looking forward to playing Two Worlds II soon.","June 27, 2015","true","249.2"," 47 of 60 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","47","60","0","0"

Perhaps because it did not have a very good marketing, hence it did not make a decent following before its release date. It was definitely not something it deserved. Two Worlds is an open-world RPG in a spirit of such games as Gothic and The Elder Scrolls. While it has many drawbacks, it certainly is a very enjoyable game at least for those players whom enjoy exploration and open-world games.\n\nThe game has a very disappointing storyline that is boring and forgettable. It only serves as a background for a player to do stuff. NPCs are quite shallow and without characters too. In addition, dialogues are horrible, not only writing is unsatisfying, but also dubbing is horrid. Although it sometimes is quite entertaining, it’s so bad that it’s good as one might say. Nonetheless, it’s definitely not a reason to play this game.\n\nTwo Worlds has some strong points though, and ultimately whether you will like the game or not depends how much you like exploration. If you love it as much as I do, then you will have a blast playing this game as it’s one of the better implemented exploration in RPGs. Not only locations are varied, but also there is no annoying level scaling of enemies or loot so prevalent in many modern RPGs and so annoyingly killing any challenge, joy and excitement out of discovering new lands. In Two Worlds you might encounter an enemy that is way above your level, however, if you are pertinacious enough, then you might kill them with use of some tricks anyway, but it might be a tough fight. Moreover, challenge is well worth it as loot that you might gain might make you more powerful. The game offers a huge gameworld and seems to be the first third person RPG that offers a decent horse riding and combat (Yes, you can fight while you are on a horse, unlike in Oblivion). Needless to say, that exploration is very satisfying, and so are combat encounters, although the combat itself is a bit too simple. However, in late game the player becomes too powerful and challenge perishes, unfortunately.\n\nTo summarize, Two Worlds is an enjoyable exploration RPG, however, with some weaknesses. I recommend it to everyone who like open world role-playing games for wandering around and experiencing new discoveries. Do not expect a good story or interesting NPCs though, as these aspects are lousy and will fail to meet your expectations whatever they are.","April 25","true","20.3"," 25 of 28 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","25","28","0","1"

It's like the Gothic/Risen games in the sense that when you kill an enemy it's dead for good, and that the world is sprinkled with some really tough enemies you'll have to level up, gear up and come back later to defeat it. The combat is mostly mindless button mashing, but it does a good enough job with it. One cool thing about this game is that you can combine weapons and armor that are the same, so eventually that weapon you first had turns out to be really good after some time. The story is alright with terrible-ish voice acting, but the game is setup good enough that I didn't pay a lot of attention to it.

The world is vast, varied and full of different things to slay and quests to do, and the best part is that you learn everything organically rather than having all the lore shoved down your throat. Combat is a little underwhelming, but there are lots of spells, abilities and tons and tons of equipment to help add flavour.\n\nThe only gripe I have with the game is that despite this being a ROLE PLAYING game, you don't really get the chance to play any role in the side quests beyond "mercenary only motived by gold" which is disappointing because it diminishes the replay value of the game and makes you feel like you don't really have an impact on the world besides checking off a list.\n\nOverall, its great game if you can look pass some of its rough edges and well worth your time and money.

These conversations are made through some of the most hilariously bad voiceovers I've heard, coupled with corny faux-fantasy writing.\n\nBut the style has kind of grown on me, and I am really enjoying the gameplay.  There's lots of loot, adventure, and exploration.  The character development is quite varied and interesting as well, with lots of playstyle options available.\n\nIf you can get past the initial low-quality shock, there's a really fun RPG in here.

At later levels, the game becomes severely punishing. Now I don't mind difficulty, but this game likes  to suddenly throw overpowered monsters at you without warning. High level monster scale rediculously well. They will have a few times your health and do a couple times your damage. If you want to be able to take on high level challenges, you either have to grind out a lot of levels, which is done by killing monsters MMO style or through quests, or invest in the severely flawed magic system.\n\nOne can understand why the monster are so strong when one takes a look at what spells are available to the player. While finding the exact spell you want is nearly impossible, getting hands on any higher level spells makes your power level spike like crazy. I was able to get my hands on a reflect aura in the earth magic school. By abusing the magic system, I was able to get my reflect spell to reflect 70% of all damage. You heard that right, 70%. It seems the game will assume your use of of magic. By throwing out rediculous monsters, it forces you to be a sort of mage-warrior no matter what.\n\nThe leveling system in this game is actually more interesting than that of Oblivion's. There are a myriad of skills that can be learned, and the aforementioned magic system provides a bunch of really cool spells. Unfortunately, in terms of melee combat the game seems to favor two-handed weapons. The advantage of dual-wielding or using a sword and shield is the ability to parry attacks (done automatically). But one quickly realizes that isn't not worth it. It's far better to abuse the two-handed weapon's long range and simply physically avoid the ennemy blows, rather than nibling away at the enemy with the extremely short ranged one-handed weapons and relying on the dice to block strikes. It doesn't help that two-handed weapons all seem to deal double the damage of one handed weapons.\n\nIn a role-playing game, the player should never be forced to do something. All roles should be equally valid. Whether that be a mighty barbarian or a graceful duelist. But the game funnels you down a single path. With some more polish and a better balanced combat and magic system, I might have really enjoyed this game. But these gaping issues ruined it for me.","December 18, 2013","false","19.9"," 74 of 118 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","74","118","0","3"

It's a bit linear as you have to do certain story parts to open up new areas. It does have replayability however, as you will pick one path and then try another path the second, third time. It's great to be a caster and attack a horde of orcs or a dragon with 8 conjured minions. I have primarily played a mage in this game up to a pretty high level. I did archer for quite some time as well, but it gets repetitive and is actually tougher than the mage. Thief is useless. The game doesn't force you into one of these archetypes, you are free to mix / match skills, but a hybrid in this game is weaker than a pure character. The game is good enough that I bother to write a review so that others will try this game.\n\nFlaws:\n1) Magic card system is weak. During combat, a caster is opening the magic window every few seconds to swap spell cards or enhancement cards. That said, the magic in this game is well thought out and looks great. I love my summoning demon bud!\n2) Item collection becomes tedious and at higher levels you just give up on it. Early in the game you almost obsess over it. Later, you ignore all but the most intriguing items.\n3) AI is weak. Mostly get bushwacked and charged. But, combat is interesting and looks great.\n4) Sneaking is useless.","July 2, 2015","true","30.1"," 37 of 53 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","37","53","2","0"

I wouldn't have minded a third inventory screen, actually.\n\nthere's also magic and bows (no need to worry about arrows) and I'd say combat is good enough, you can mix things up, though it can get a bit hectic because aggroing an enemy usually mobilizes their friends as well. but most importantly (for me anyway), the game doesn't have respawning enemies (there's a ghost mechanic though that's explained in the game, but it's only troublesome in the beginning) nor level scaling, which can make for one-hit deaths early on if you run into something far above your level.\n\nthe alchemy system is pretty good too, you can make temporary and permanent potions and gems from almost everything, plants, monster drops, minerals, and they really make a difference. if you're into exploring and hoarding, you can become so powerful that almost everything will die in a few hits. this might be a problem for some, but you don't have to make potions, obviously, and you don't have to kill every wolf you run into for even more xp. that's what I did though: I can't remember the last game where I wanted to explore absolutely everything and where exploration was so relaxing even with literally thousands of enemies around. I'm not one for farming and grinding, but I killed them all (more than 10.000) while I was at it. I wouldn't say the game world is especially unique, though later on you'll run into some weird creatures and unsettling environments.\n\nthere are a lot of quests, some of them are pretty basic, some are more involved, and sometimes you have to make a decision, you can't complete everything (though it's possible to have max reputation with all the factions at the same time until you anger them). the main story is nothing to write home about, your sister's missing, go find her, oh, and save the world in the meantime, will you? the game shines in the sidequest department though. there are a few funny ones, some are touching, and they can have unforeseen consequences. you think you're done and did the right thing, but when you go back to the village or npc later, you'll find you actually made things worse. I loved these.\n\nI could go on for days about the game but I'm sure these reviews have a character limit, so I'll stop before I get too much into it. long story short, if you're looking for an open-world fantasy rpg you probably haven't played, check this one out. if you want to do everything, it'll keep you busy for more than 100 hours (or you can just concentrate on questing and be done a lot faster).","April 2","true","182.2"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jackaho/recommended/1930/","jackaho","jackaho","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jackaho/","538 products in account","I once asked an online forum whether Two Worlds was any good.  Among the sea of negative responses was a single positive vote for the game.  I asked that one person why he or she liked the game and the response was, "I don't know, I just love the open-worldiness of the game."\n\nOpen-worldiness is an apt description of Two World's major strength.  After a quick and painless tutorial you are given a couple quests and off you go.  The world is yours to explore.  If you like games like this, then you may like Two Worlds too.\n\nThe major negative about this game is, in spite of the huge world, there just isn't a lot to explore.  Compared to a game like Elder Scrolls Oblivion with quests and dungeons around every corner, Two Worlds feels like Oblivion on a stringent budget.  You'll often run into the same creatures and bandits.  These creatures are challenging at first, but terribly easy to beat in later levels.  By the time you cross a certain place in the map to face more challenging creatures, you've already progressed to the point where those are easy to beat.\n\nDungeons are few and not very memorable.  Worse yet, there doesn't seem to be a point to them.  The joy you get from getting to the end of a long dungeon and getting that memorable item you wanted is not present in this game.  They seem more like an afterthought.  A couple of corridors filled with the same enemies who mostly run straight at you swinging once  you are spotted.\n\nCombat in general is lackluster, your most used ability is jumping backwards to dodge swings.  Once you've learned this skill, melee combat becomes a breeze and your only difficulty comes from the occasional archers and mages.  I once took down a Cyclops, one of the largest and toughest enemies in the game, simply by jumping backwards and getting a hit or two in before he could swing again.  A single hit would have killed me but I was still able to defeat it.  If you come to Two Worlds looking for tough combat, you're not going to find it.\n\nI do enjoy the armor "crafting" and upgrading.  Simply find an identical piece of armor, drop it over your existing armor and you have a stronger piece or armor.  The same can be done with weapons.  Skill upgrades are plenty with skills ranging from five classes of magic (earth, air, fire, water, necromancy) to specialize in to multiple weapons, armor, and archery skills and buffs.  You are not forced into any one class so you may mix and match as you choose, a nice feature of the game.  Tip: Lockpicking is a must as nearly every valuable item is hidden away in a locked chest.\n\nAlchemy, on the other hand, is a complete mess and does not work they way it is instructed in the manual.  For all the plants and minerals you collect in your travels, each labeled with a specific buff or permanent upgrade, they don't provide much use unless you have maxed the alchemy skill.  Personally, I kept the items that gave permanent upgrades and never used the rest.  Tip:  You MUST include a health or mana potion when combining minerals or you will not get the upgrades you want.\n\nIn short, this may be a game you'll enjoy if you like the freedom to explore and upgrade your skills to suit the fighting style you enjoy.  Just expect to get bored of the combat and the limited content before the story ends.\n\n- - -\n\nEdit:  A warning.  This game requires registration of a CD key Steam provides you in order to work.  Fortunately, the servers are still online and they provide you with a nice piece of gear for doing so.  Not bad for a seven year old game.  (Hear that EA?!?!)\n\nAlso, this game uses an old version of PhysX drivers that the latest drivers do not support.  Nvidia card users need to download and install the old drivers from this website in order to get the game to work: http://www.nvidia.com/object/physx-9.12.1031-legacy-driver.html","June 28, 2014","true","46.1"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

Enemies offer wide range of fighting styles and some variation between same enemy types, for instance wolf will fight differently than zombie and bandit archer will fight differently than bandit mage.\n\nOverall I'll recommend Two Worlds as it will give you 30+ hours of gameplay, but only if you like open world games and are a fan of RPGs and can look over some unpolished bits in favor of overall experience.\n","May 19, 2015","true","33.7"," 16 of 24 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","16","24","2","0"

I have all the different types such as blackie, goldie, whitey, skelly, and scaley. When I found my first horse I was "oh cool a hores" then I drove the horse back home. Now a single day isn't complete without going in search of a horse to rescue from the tiny fists of an mini orc boss. Now I spend most of my in-game time tending to my horses, making sure they have enough feed, bringing them inside when it gets cold outside.\n\nWhat can I say, It's my life now.

In many respects similar to an Elder Scrolls game with the same freedom of movement, collecting alchemy ingredients, running around doing quests, and the same sense towards the end of the game that you can destroy everything with ease.\n\nEnemies tend to be in either groups of average strength or single or pairs of overwhelming strong enemies. They have to be managed differently, and archery is actually very usefull especialy when facing large number of archers who can disarm you and do decent levels of damage.\n\nThe first 30 minutes of the game is a grind but get past that and the game becomes very enjoyable.\n\nOne of the really enjoyable things about the game is that the guards of towns are no stronger than they should be. So if you are able to take down a cyclops or slay a dragon you don't get the sillyness of guards being able to bash you up. In fact if you want you can rampage through the world slaying everyone and reserecting people afterwards. It's slightly over the top but it really adds to the enjoyment.","May 17, 2014","true","61.1"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

Even re-playable.\n\nEspecially like:\n- Seamless nature of the world. Very few load-screens. Even entering towns and homes is seamless. This is how it should be!\n- Variety of quests and goals, mostly optional.\n- Engaging skill choices.\n\nQuibbles. Not really "dislike" but "somewhat annoying"\n- Times when the merchants are wandering around randomly. Finding the same merchant again is a pain.\n- Horses steer like they're brain-damaged. Sometimes will veeer off to one side and suddenly you can't steer anymore.\n- Horses again. You can't ride down a hill, but you can get off the horse and call it down the hill. WTF?\n- Some of the quests are incredibly obtuse, relying more on luck and happenstance than on deliberate planning.\n\nMajor bugs:\n- The crashing. Especially after saving a few times, it'll just crash on my system. No response from either Steam or the "official" game support.\n- The dialog. Only looking at some videos did I realize there was supposed to be dialog! Totally not working on my system. I only get the text, but everyone is silent.\n\n\nDefinitely worth the buy. Now if I could just convince Steam to let me have the Strategy Guide I paid for. It's DLC, but it refuses to install. I'm guessing it's a Steam issue, but they keep passing the buck to the publisher, who has no control over Steam.","May 23","true","69.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Sure, the game don't tell you basically anything about how anything works, but you can always read the pdf manual that Steam gives you and find all the details there, but anyway, after just 1.5 hours I already was going through the menus without problems and without ever reading the manual.\nThere's stuff you'll learn with practice or by trial and error, but if you don't want to read that pdf you can consider it like an adventure in the adventure :)\nOne very useful thing that the game don't tell you (or I didn't notice) is that you can merge 2 identical items into a better one by just drag and dropping one onto the other one, while in your inventory. That way you can improve your current equipment for free, without the need to buy a better one.\n\nNow I just hope I won't hit that quest bug that another user experienced, that seem to happen because some side-quests can break the main quest if done before it, but I'm trying to not let the main quest behind too much and I hope that'll be enough.","May 27, 2015","true","79.5"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

It's somehow both bad and fun at the same time.\n\nLets get this out of the way: this is a trashy Eastern European RPG. The generic plot is written in bad ye olde englishe and spoken by the worst non-native speakers this side of House of the Dead. It will actively try to disuade you from paying attention to the plot, and yet IT WON'T SHUT UP. Hoods breath, does this game have diarrhea of the mouth.\n\nAnd yet, it's really enjoyable for the cheap RPG it is. Once you realize that all weapons attack at the same speed and dodging instantly makes you immune to damage, you can cheese the game like a boss. Oh, and when you die, you just respawn at the nearest health shrine, no xp loss or anything. Still not as great as other European RPGs like Gothic or Risen, but it's not the hellspawn that it has the reputation for. Then again, I really enjoy terrible movies, so I guess I just have trashy taste.","December 5, 2015","true","23.4"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","64","9","14","6","0"

It's biggest hurdle is just its first impression. The character creation is a joke, the cut-scenes & voice-acting are hammy, the controls and menu navigation a bit unintuitive, initially.\n\nHowever, give this game an hour or two to grow on you, and you will find a vastly underrated, very free, open-world fantasy RPG that will give you hundreds of hours of enjoyment. The loot is vast and randomly generated (and items are stackable, which means looting never gets entirely old); the levelling is well-paced and addictive; the scope of abilities interesting to experiment with (archery, traps, magic, various combat techniques, etc.)  The alchemy/crystal system is very interesting as well, though you might want to download a strategy guide to get the most out of it.\n\nCombat and enemy AI are weak and relatively easy to exploit, but that didn't bother me much -- I just view the game as more of a Diablo-esque, loot-driven kind of experience, vs. a game built around challenging/nuanced combat. And although the story and voice-acting initially seem awful, the cheesiness of it becomes a part of the charm, and the protagonist is often actually very funny. He becomes strangely good company as you go roaming the world by yourself.\n\nVisually, the game holds up exceptionally well, if you have a good graphics card. I don't know if the graphics were revamped for the epic edition, but at times the game looks on a par with a high-end Skyrim, and the world can be quite beautiful. There is also a ton of detail in the armor, weapons, etc. I've also had no problems with bugs/crashes or anything like that, with the Epic Edition.\n\nAlso a plus: the world is absolutely *huge*. I am certain it is much bigger than any recent Bethesda games by far, and the environments are quite varied once you get out a bit.\n\nIn short, this is a game that got -- to my mind -- unfairly passed over when it was released. It does have its quirks and doesn't make a great first impression when you start up, but I can honestly say I've had as much fun with this game as any other open-world RPG you can name, and like it as well -- if not better -- than Skyrim. They're just different. At anything <$20 -- let alone the 2.99 or so you often see it for -- it is an absolute steal.\n\nHighly recommended.","March 2, 2015","true","60.3"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

If by that the devs meant make the player never want to play a fantasy rpg again, then they succeeded. the cons far outweigh the pros for this too ambitious title.\nPros:\n1: Neat lore elements that obviously had at least some creative thought put into them.\n2: Fully voiced.\n3: Some humorous side characters.\n4: Large explorable map.\n5: Fully illustrated strategy guide, should you make the extra purchase.\n\nCons:\n1: Strange registration setup that requires exiting the game upon starting the game.\n2: Unimaginative and uniteresting storyline.\n3: All of the voices are terrible. Like really, really bad.\n4: Bland and annoying main character. Most of the supporting characters are this way as well.\n5: The map barely resembles the actual terrain, and a vast portion of the landscape is nearly impossible to traverse.\n6: Many areas of the game look unfinshed, with random invisible walls, inescapable holes in the ground, etc.\n7: Stupidly easy, if you are even the slightest bit versed in building characters or can do 3rd grade math. (Normally, I like easy games, but this was too much even for me.)\n8: The most repetative gameplay you will ever experience from a game that is not on mobile. Exploring, questing, fighting, all of it.\n9: One of the most atrocious set of game mechanics I have ever experienced. Fighting monsters was silmultaniously a bore and a chore.\n\nI could probably go on with the cons of this game, but I think I covered the main points. So if you are willing to push through hours of horrible gameplay for a semi-funny joke every now and then, by all means by this game. If not, do not. With 225 hours in this game, I am probably one of the leading authorities on Two Worlds now; and my recommendation is to never touch this game.","June 2","false","225.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

From the start of multiplayer mode, you'll be getting your ♥♥♥♥ handed to you on a silver platter over and over and over again, and the enemies will promptly give you more beatings.\n\nThere's challenge to be had here, but it doesn't add much to the genre overall. I've heard that through the later levels you have a lot more freedom to customize your character, but I didn't see much through the miniscule time that I played. It was just basic kill X target or gather X item, not much innovation. The lower level multiplayer enviroments don't look very interesting, and I imagine it would be a bore to trudge through without a friend by your side.\n\nWithin the multiplayer component, the quest rewards were very underwhelming. In the map that I played, all I gained from completing them was gold, gold, and more gold. Where are the unique items, you might ask? They're sold by NPCs, or sometimes found on corpses, or within treasure chests.\n\nIf you bore easily, this isn't the game for you. I wouldn't recommend playing multiplayer without a friend, my friend and I only saw five other people playing at the same time. I can't speak for the singleplayer content as I haven't played it, but I imagine it's more or less the same. The story and voice acting are also terrible, so I wouldn't purchase the game if you're looking for that.\n\nYou should also know that there are some nasty bugs that come along with this game, after several hours of playing multiplayer, I abruptly crashed and lost all of my progress. So be wary of the multiplayer aspect of the game, you could unexpectedly lose all of your progress, and there is no fix for this that I know of.\n\n\n\ntl;dr\n\nTwo Worlds brings back the old school feel, but it doesn't measure up to other games released in its time period. If you're looking for a great RPG experience, I'd recommend Oblivion or Dragon Age: Origins.\n\n4/10. It's an average and bland game, but that's part of its charm.\n","April 24, 2014","true","3.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I didn't keep up with the hype and the marketing for this game, and it was because of a YouTuber called ProJared and his review of this game that I bought it, mainly to see if it was as bad as he said it was. And - surprise, surprise - he was right.\n\nTwo Worlds, according to ProJared's Review (be prepared to see ProJared's name come up a LOT in this "review"), was going to put another game - The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion - to shame. Needless to say, it didn't even come close to matching Oblivion in anything. And I'm going to prove it.\n\nThe game starts off with the Main Character and his twin sister, Kira, riding through the rain. Kira is injured, and falls off the horse. Here is where one of the many problems of Two Worlds starts to show. First off, the voice acting. It's God-awful. Every single voice actor - well, with an exception or two - is bad. Every line of speech is forced, no emotion is in the dialogue and even worse, the text in the game looks like it was written by someone trying to emulate Shakespeare.\n\nThe story for this game is simple. As the Main Character goes to look for a shelter that he and Kira can stay in for the night to keep out of the rain, Kira gets kidnapped. About six months later, in the first village you're in (I don't remember what it was called, just more proof of how bad this game is) you recieve a letter telling you that your sister is alive. After reading the letter, the village elder gives you your first quest, the traditional cliché quest at the beginning of most RPGs out there: clear a cave of monsters. You do that, you come out of the cave which is really a temple, and when you're through with that task, some guy from the first village tells you that some "hard warriors" have come looking for you. After that, you find the man who kidnapped your sister - Gandohar - and he tells you to go and meet his master Reist in the Goat's Cave. You meet Reist, and he tells you to go and talk to Gandohar. Refresh my memory, why did I need to go in there again? Anyways, speaking with Gandohar reveals that he "claims" that he wants to help Kira, and to do that, he needs you to go and collect four treasures representing the four elements: Fire, Wind, Water, and Earth. There's also a fifth piece that binds them together just like that ring from Lord of the Rings. And apparently, only the Main Character and Kira can touch the key and nobody else can, similar to the Vampire Killer whip from the Castlevania franchise. That's really all I can say about the story, because I pretty much quit playing after that.\n\nGameplay: The gameplay is somewhat similar to Oblivion, but they somehow managed to screw that up. When you're fighting anything in this game, and I mean anything, it all basically amounts to a button masher swinging wildly at everything around you, and I mean everything. There's no surefire way to be sure that you're hitting something other than the blood that shoots out of enemies, and the punch sound that accompanies trying to hit something with a steel blade that clearly is there to cause bruises rather than draw blood, but whatever.\n\nThe graphics here are a mixed bag. The character models and everything look awful, to the point where they would barely pass as PS2 graphics, and they're animated so poorly. The lip-synching is also terrible, which makes Godzilla movies look masterful. However, and this is what I mean by the graphics being a mixed bag, is that not everything looks terrible, the enviroments are kind of nice. I can admit that.\n\nThe music sounds like your typical midieval sword & sorcery-style RPG, with light tunes when exploring, heavy tunes when in danger, things like that.\n\nAll in all, I have to say that it's a damn shame this game didn't quite live up to the hype, because it shows great potential that could have easily put The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion to shame, but they let their ambitions and a clichéd story along with awful gameplay get in the way of it all. Also, the voice acting was really disappointing as well. Still, hopefully they learned their lesson with this game and made Two Worlds II MUCH better, but I'll be going into it expecting the worst.","April 21","false","9.1"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

The acting is rubbish to be quite honest, and the story isn't that exciting(when you finish it, the game simply ends - I didn't actually feel inspired to finish it until I was nearly done with the sidequests). The main reason I had such a long playtime for it was because of the weapon upgrade system which had me running around randomly searching for weapons to combine with what I already owned(and usually find something better), the sidequests which sometimes had an interesting bit of backstory to them and the NPCs(in cities especially) who were remarkably fun to kill or scare with different types of spells(Guards will instakill you at first though).\n\nTwo Worlds is also still fairly nice looking for the age it is - don't expect groundbreaking graphics, but the green environments especially still look quite nice.","December 20, 2014","true","4.7"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","11","20","2","0"

Just coming off Oblivion (which I'd played obsessively), I was so excited for Two Worlds!\n\nWell, I played it about 30 minutes, was horrendously disappointed, laughed at it a bit, and gave up.  It's very pretty.  That's about all I have to say about it.\n\nRecently, seeing all the positive (??) reviews for the game, I grabbed it for $2.  Well, I wish I had my money back.

Above all negative towers this Reality Pump release, the story-line gets the worst part. Not-so-epic, and somehow basic, we take the role of a traveller searching for his sister who is mysteriously kidnaped. After being approached by a strange man who leads us to the main quest, we start our journey only to realise the side-quests are actually more interesting. Despise all the shortness, the main-quest encourages the player to explorer the kingdom, complete site-quests, gain reputation among the several available factions, choose a side among the war against the orcs, and discover new areas.\nMuch like Gothic series, this action RPG gives you the freedom to explore the world as you want, with an amazing combat system that puts you to the test by fighting bandits, goblins, wild animals, Cyclops, and many other creatures we are used to encounter in this genres. Getting yourself in the wrong side of the map might lead you to difficult enemies, but with great rewards worth the trouble.\nTwo Worlds offers a simple and interesting system where the player can create new items by cooking all sort of organic and magic objects. Mixing up till 5, the result may be different each time you tweak with the items, but you get to keep all the recipes for future use. New potions with a lot of different results are the most common, this will certainly make the game a lot easier, since harvesting items can be done pretty much everywhere. You can’t craft new weapons, but you can upgrade them, and that’s good enough. There’s plenty to choose from the vast variety of armour-sets, swords, staffs, and many more powerful objects to kill all those evil Golems!\nThe player also relies on magic, and for that the levelling up is great, choose among the 5 elements, and advance your combat skills and how well you manoeuvre your weapons.\nAlthough the gameplay is flawless and the graphics try to keep with it, the major problem falls upon the text-dialogue. NPC are just repetitive, in both appearance and dialogues, and that’s really a shame, because some actually tell you interesting things about the world of Two Worlds. It’s a big map, but very repetitive, even with snow, desert and deep forests, the game lacks on dungeons with only a handful of them to complete and loot. Small huts and villages with hidden secrets might be your salvation after a long walk throughout the world.\n\nWith great emphasis on side-quests, your journey won’t be a waste of time, and in time you may learn to enjoy it.\nOne of those games where you love it or hate it. Can’t go medium with this one, it’s made for RPG fans. Unless you are one, stay way.\nCould be batter, but could be a lot worst considering all things! 6/10.","July 27, 2015","true","79.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I don't know what it is about my computer, but this game refuses to play on it under any circumstances. I believe I got it to work once, right after I got it, and when I got the game, the controls were absolutely atrocious and unintuitive on the xbox 360 gamepad.\n\nNow though, I can't even get this game to run without crashing to desktop with a 'Two Worlds is not responding' message, and I know what the common issues with this game are, I've tried all of the 1 fix I've ever seen for this game crashing, which is installing the proper nvidia Physx legacy driver. I've done that exact thing, installing and uninstalling the drivers multiple times, verifying game caches, uninstalling and reinstalling the game, running a command line parameter that allows me to finally launch the game in a tiny window only for it to crash while loading. This game doesn't know how to function. The programmers must have been complete idiots when they made this.\n\nThe only positive thing to come away from this game with is that at least the developers learned from this and made Two Worlds II a much more competent, smoother, and overall better experience. If you wanna check out Two Worlds, don't bother, get the sequel.\n\n----------\nEdit:\n\nAlright. I finally got this thing to work, and here was the problem, files in OTHER GAMES I OWNED were keeping this game from running. I have no clue how ANYONE can fail at programming a game so hard that having another file in another location on your computer for another game keeps this other, ENTIRELY DIFFERENT GAME from FUNCTIONING. The solution, to people who had the same problem as me is, check your games for lgvid.ax files and delete them. These files are most common in Looking Glass's Dark Engine games (System Shock 2, Thief Gold, and Thief 2: The Metal Age are the most likely culprits). While I could also use that as an opportunity to lay the blame on those games, the fact of the matter is, I have over 200 games in my library and not ONE besides this game ceased to function just because of a file it shouldn't even be referencing that exists in my other games.\n\nThat said, if you can fix it and get it working, Two Worlds is worth trying. Getting past the technical issues, I have been playing the game quite regularly in the past week or so, putting in over 20 hours already, and most of that was just me exploring, killing monsters and bandits and groms and animals, then looting, equipping, improving, and selling their stuff without doing any quests. So I'd say it makes for a fairly enjoyable sandbox Action-RPG that I would recommend, but again, ONLY if you have no issues getting it to run. The technical issues should be a big red flag if you plan on getting this game at anything other than a considerable discount.","August 10, 2014","true","53.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","6"

You play as a mercenary who will do anything to save his sister, Kira. There are many enemies you must face: blood-thirsty orcs, golems, ogers, dragons, necromancers, you name it. I'm just going to say it straight-forward. This game is hard. When you first start out, you are extremely weak; you struggle to slay a couple bandits without using a health potion or spell. As you progress things only become harder. You may be able to slay 12 bandits with your mighty greatsword with no problem at all. But how will you fare against an oger? Or 5 necromancers? It is satisfying, being able to kill something you once struggled to even hit. But know that there will always be an enemy that will utterly destroy you. When you die, you respawn at the last shrine you visited (there are A LOT of shrines around the world). You don't have to go back to your last save or anything like that. Which can be both good and bad. The game play is great, the graphics are good enough to keep your immersion, and the voice acting is mediocre at best. There are flaws, but there is a lot of fun gameplay here. Unfortunately, after you complete the game, there's virtually no replay value. I haven't picked it up since I beat it. So, if you're looking for a game you can beat multiple times consecutively, then this isn't the game for you. I had fun playing it, and I do recommend it if you're looking for a good open world RPG.\n8/10","August 15, 2014","true","24.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I had issues getting my gamepad to work with the game, but conquered that battle. And even after getting the gamepad to work, the game (especially the combat) handles like a monster truck with no power steering. Now don't get me wrong even after all the issues above & the occasional crash (after 20+ I experienced: 1 during gameplay & 1 lock up during exiting the game) this game is pretty friggen good.\n\nCombat is a bit clunky. I wish it was as polished as Amalur's, but I wasn't expecting a whole hell of a lot coming into this one. The best I can say for combat is it's passable.\n\nStoryline is above average. Not too cliche.\n\nGraphics are not horrible for a 2009 release.\n\nAudio is pretty damn good. I found my self impressed with the wildlife sounds Top Ware bothered to add.\n\nTwo Worlds WILL fight with you. Knowing that, would I recommend it at full price?

I do love the part of the map where the volcanos are and all that, as it was done very nice. The mobs are fantastic and unique as well, such as the Lava Dragon.

Tons of framerate issues, game-breaking bugs, and moreover a very unimpressive intro and beginner newbie area. The game eventually got patched, and I enjoyed it enough to later buy the PC version, and for my friends and I, Two Worlds 1 has become a guilty pleasure. I actually bought this twice on the PC, directly from publisher and later via Steam, so my hours don't reflect all of my accumulated playing time.\n\nI have to stress, though, that you have to weather the horrible beginning of the game. The game cinematic intro is uninspiring, then it drops you into a forest area, eventually giving you a barebones tutorial that doesn't show you the cool features of the game. On top of that, you have to make your way to your first town which sports some of the worst voice acting I've heard heard in a game. Fortunately, the voice acting improves a bit as you get further into the game, however the dialogue is still pretty bad, but you get used to it.\n\nOn your way to the town, you may get mauled by wolves, which travel in packs, which until you learn the agro system of the game, you may die repeatedly.  So often, gamers will just quit at this point, several hours into the game, which is a shame, and I believe why most people didn't give this game a fair shake.  Lots to learn -- how to use the magic system, how to collect ingredients, how to handle night time creatures in the game (you won't be able to kill them initially so run away from them), etc.\n\nI really liked the weapon-combining system which I wish more games would implement.  You can combine similar weapons to upgrade your main weapon, so alleviates inventory issues, just keep combing that generic sword over and over. It also solves the moan-and-groan of finding junk loot, because in this game, you can make an uber weapon out of crappy weapons. Of course, eventually you'll want to combine higher-level weapons, but it's a great way to lessen inventory issues.\n\nI also loved the co-op feature, able to the play the entire game again with a friend. Not sure if you can still do this, though, because I don't remember if it needed access to original Two Worlds servers.\n\nCharacter models may look a bit dated, but the world still looks pretty good, and it has a lot of variety. Lots of side-quest and secrets to explore and enough variety to replay the game with different classes, which is also a strength, Classes aren't set in stone, but you can develop your character however way you want. Some people have issues with the mounting system, getting aggravated with the horse mount, but I found the PC version is far improved over the 360 version.\n\nTwo Worlds 2, the sequel,  is by far, a more polished game, but TW1 sports a larger world, and doesn't have the weapon combining feature.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sirchrono/recommended/1930/","sirchrono","Jug Face","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sirchrono/","106 products in account","Why can't my horse keep a straight line? Why won't it turn where I want to go? Why can't I cast a spell on a moving horse? How do the skill shortcuts work? Why can't I reassign them? Why only 3 spells at a time? Why this botched and weird alchemy system? Why did I keep playing? So many questions, a couple of laughs, and a good amount of frustration later I did actually finish this game, in a most shameful binge. That's one thing this game has over Skyrim/Oblivion I suppose... I bothered to finish it. Towards the end I skipped most quests and hated the ones I had to do and I am very glad I am finished with this game.\n\nOnce you figure it out (and you will have to, and make allowances for bugs and glitchiness, etc), this game opens up and is pleasant enough to play despite the annoyingly slow animations, dumb plot and characters, general uninspiredness, useless and bugged and bizarre skills, and general laughability. It reminds me a lot of Dungeon Siege if it was mixed with Morrowind and made in eastern Europe, which I guess is why it spoke to me more than Skyrim/Oblivion did. Permanent +stat potions make alchemy necessary and briefly interesting as you seek new ingredients and wonder how/if they'll work. If this game had been allowed to gestate another 6 to 8 months it would've been pretty good, possibly better than the games it was competing with. As it stands, it's a large mostly empty world filled with nothing but annoying chained fetchquests, and it will give you the sense it's a rush job.\n\nThe little teleport stones (as in Divine Divinity) are brilliant and make up for some of the annoyances of travel - more games need that or at least Mark/Recall ability. Swimming is ridiculously bad and that they made it skillbased was a really bad choice - there are some major design issues with this game. It only crashed once when I played it, and there were no game-breaking bugs, but some of the quests are a little wonky. There is almost no replay value here, but on sale it should cost less than 2 bucks, which is roughly a fair price for the enjoyment you should be able to eke out of it. I don't think I'll return for Game 2, but I had my fun and laughed pretty hard at some of the oddities of this game. +1 for Taint Shoots.\n\n(If you really want to have a laugh after you finish this, check out youtube user 'ProJared's' review, in which he, the babylike pro, admits to having problems playing an incredibly simple and generally unchallenging game and cheating to defeat it because it's unfair. This game was many things as well as being poorly designed, but only blatantly unfair at the very end.)","August 7, 2014","true","39.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Tons of framerate issues, game-breaking bugs, and moreover a very unimpressive intro and beginner newbie area. The game eventually got patched, and I enjoyed it enough to later buy the PC version, and for my friends and I, Two Worlds 1 has become a guilty pleasure. I actually bought this twice on the PC, directly from publisher and later via Steam, so my hours don't reflect all of my accumulated playing time.\n\nI have to stress, though, that you have to weather the horrible beginning of the game. The game cinematic intro is uninspiring, then it drops you into a forest area, eventually giving you a barebones tutorial that doesn't show you the cool features of the game. On top of that, you have to make your way to your first town which sports some of the worst voice acting I've heard heard in a game. Fortunately, the voice acting improves a bit as you get further into the game, however the dialogue is still pretty bad, but you get used to it.\n\nOn your way to the town, you may get mauled by wolves, which travel in packs, which until you learn the agro system of the game, you may die repeatedly.  So often, gamers will just quit at this point, several hours into the game, which is a shame, and I believe why most people didn't give this game a fair shake.  Lots to learn -- how to use the magic system, how to collect ingredients, how to handle night time creatures in the game (you won't be able to kill them initially so run away from them), etc.\n\nI really liked the weapon-combining system which I wish more games would implement.  You can combine similar weapons to upgrade your main weapon, so alleviates inventory issues, just keep combing that generic sword over and over. It also solves the moan-and-groan of finding junk loot, because in this game, you can make an uber weapon out of crappy weapons. Of course, eventually you'll want to combine higher-level weapons, but it's a great way to lessen inventory issues.\n\nI also loved the co-op feature, able to the play the entire game again with a friend. Not sure if you can still do this, though, because I don't remember if it needed access to original Two Worlds servers.\n\nCharacter models may look a bit dated, but the world still looks pretty good, and it has a lot of variety. Lots of side-quest and secrets to explore and enough variety to replay the game with different classes, which is also a strength, Classes aren't set in stone, but you can develop your character however way you want. Some people have issues with the mounting system, getting aggravated with the horse mount, but I found the PC version is far improved over the 360 version.\n\nTwo Worlds 2, the sequel,  is by far, a more polished game, but TW1 sports a larger world, and doesn't have the weapon combining feature. If you can do some reading of the game mechanics, and not give up right away, you may find yourself enjoying this game.","December 29, 2014","true","1.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Overall I still give it a thumbs up.  There are many ways to play your character - I did "two handed weapon Tank".   Due to the negatives (specifically being overpowered due to alchemy I just can't see myself doing a second play thru and that's why I rate it good and not great.\n\nYou'll play 80-100 hours and if you like these types of games, you'll enjoy it but won't be wowed by it and likely won't want to play it thru a second time.\n\nOther games of its ilk (Titan Quest comes to mind as something close I've played thru multiple times with variety of builds).  This one - I don't think it'd make a difference.   When you have 50000 HP with 1500 HP heal spell and monsters do 100 points of damage and it takes one/two hit to kill them, the juice just goes out the window for combat related aspects of the game.\n\nWhat I liked -\nLarge open world to explore.  While some areas are harder to navigate before you get strong, for the most part you can go anywhere at any time.\nAlchemy skill was extremely fun (albeit it does make you overpowered)\nmerging items to craft a better item of same type - really liked this.\nU.I good, easy to pick up\nSide quests were enjoyable.\nThe atmosphere was very good.\nUnlike others, I found the storyline reasonable and I didn't mind the graphics.\n\n\nDue to alchemy and the lavishness of resources that add to your stats "permanently", you become very overpowered very quickly.   At about level 20 or so I had a "Spear of Destiny" which is a one-hit kill for most monsters and was a three hit kill for Dragons, all Golems, and all Boss Monsters (final battle was a one-hit).  I also had 50000 hit points and 20000 in physical resistence and 8000 in resistence to Elements (most monsters do hundreds of points of damage).  At no juncture did I feel threatened in any battle.\n\nThis one main aspect to me keeps this game from being great.\n\n\n","February 10, 2015","true","91.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You're the kind of hero who prefers to narrate everything you do, all the while sounding like the last guy who told your drunk ♥♥♥ to get in the trunk. The kind of hero with the air of a repeat sex offender who eats nails for breakfast, but possesses a warm gooey center and extremely mixed feelings about their scantily clad sister who looks nothing like them 99.9% of the time. If you feel like chasing the big bad hard warrior known as Gandohar and is sensible but stylish  master named Reist across the damn continent to save your sister prepare yourself for a twist that would probably make M. Night Shablabdingdong proud.\n\n\nNote that it will cause everyone else to indifferently stare at the screen while fiddling with their genitalia. Oh yeah you kill a lot of things and get progressively shinier armor to protect you from (or attract) Gandohars firm hands, its all fun and games till the bad guy starts caressing you like  you're his pillow. Also this game is a fantastic substitute for Blender Simulator 2013, I'd like to see those sim punks make an even better identical sword by throwing 20 of them in a blender together!\n\n\n\n\nSeriously though Two Worlds has...\n\nSymbol Key\n--------------------\n++= very good\n+= good\n- = bad\n--------------------\n\n- Hilarious voice acting (yes its bad but in a good way) +\n\n- Exploration! ++\n\n- Some Forgettable quests -\n\n- Plenty of quests +\n\n- Plentiful factions but no real consequences for reputation other than more or less quests =\n\nThe combat is somewhat difficult but unlike other games you can't permanently die, you'll just get ressurected at a nearbly Maliel Shrine and continue your journey back to that damn Cyclops that used your helmet as a bongo. No item loss, no nothing, just rinse and repeat till you win (quicksaving in other RPG's is kind of the same thing though). Did I mention the map is huge and full of diverse and fairly interesting environments complete with some fairly standard but servicable guilds/factions to be a part of?\n\n\nWhether you're slaying Jackals and Dragons in the desert, killing Polar Bears and Orcs up in the glacier, being chased through the ruins of the deadlands surrounding a destroyed city with appropriate amounts of demons, undead, and more. Maybe you'll just slaughter entire cities and towns for fun once you become powerful enough? Just don't beat the main quest right away as once its over so is the game, its a lot more fun to explore the exotic landscapes of Antaloor and though they may lack much lore to give them added signifigance, its always the journey that beats the destination. Good thing the journey is so damn fun.\n\n\nYes the voice acting is THAT bad and you will love it!

I really like the alchemy system, you have 4 slots I believe if i can remember, and you get ingredients from plants or wildlife that give you buffs. The skill system makes sense and I honestly have no problem with it, it has a sense of progression. For instance you have to be a certain level before you can put more points into a skill. This way you don't find yourself leveling one skill the entire time. I also like the fact that there is reputation with the factions in the game. It runs on a scale of 1-10, 1 being not important and 10 being very important. The more quests you do for a faction the more rep you gain. The questing is fun and the voice acting isn't really all that bad, It's better than reading quests (Morrowind).

And i am one of them. This game became just a "+1" to my game list, though i like role-play games very much, but i'm not sorry for buying it. As usual, i will start from "minuses":\n\n- The sound. Who was synchronizing it? I suppose it was a computer with plain intonation. No emotions at all.\n- The plot. Just see - from the very beginning the main hero behaves a bit indifferent to his companion (leaves her alone) and that leads to her loss. 50/50 apprehension.\n- The hero's skill of sward flutter. It looked a bit strange, as if his knees and elbows were aching.\n- A lot of personal information is to be filled in into the form. Am i going to be a deputy or am i to cast a vote? :D\n\nAnd pluses:\n\n+ An open world. Always liked that, and this game isn't an exclusion.\n+ A skill-tree. Making level-ups brings you not only stats, but also an ability to choose your specialization. That's just a part of RPG.\n+ Graphics. Though it's not acute, but it also doesn't disturb your eyes. Never the less, it could have been MUCH better.\n\nI don't know, whether you are to buy this game or not. So it's up to you. I can't say something towards its "defence", as towards its "prosecution".","April 1, 2015","true","3.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

You can see my Steam playtime, most of it was created with Win 8.1. And I never had a single crash. There IS a problem starting the game at first, but this can easily be fixed by searching the forum and downloading the correct drivers.\n\nTwo Worlds is several years old, so of course you can't expect graphics of 2015. But for its age, it looks quite good imo. You can customize your hero to some point, so if he looks like a goblin, it's not the fault of the game...\n\nThe combat and general controls: I have neither the time nor the patience to struggle with complex controls, so if I enjoy a game (and I DO enjoy Two Worlds a lot) you can be sure it's not too hard to handle. Movement, inventory, map and stuff are standard. You need your LM for your weapon and your RM for special attacks and magic. With your mousewheel you can easily toggle between the desired abilites. It's really not THAT hard. For starters there's even a manual in your Steam library.\n\nIt's a large world with about 170 quests in total and the possibility to explore everything, so you'll be busy for a while. There are no classes, you can develop your character as you wish and choose your abilites from close and ranged combat, traps, stealth and 5 different magic schools. There's a big amount of weapons and armor as well as a lot of different enemies.\n\nFurthermore you have alchemy, lockpicking and horses (and in contrast to what some people say riding is pretty easy).\n\nAll in all I really enjoy this game again and again. The only complaint I have is the activation limit (when your activations are gone, you have to contact support to reset them), but the developers think of removing it.

Horrible, despicable, disgusting VA.\n2) The script is so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ bad... I have no idea who tried to make it "medieval" with all these phrases like "pray tell me", "pithee" etc., I just stopped trying to read through these terrible, horrible, damnable lines and just skipped everything. Never lost a thing.\n3) Plot is boring, subplots are boring and unrememberable.\n4) Horse riding tends to be awkward. Like, AWKWARD round riding.\n5) Tons of useless NPC, boring names, overall "i try to be medieval and fail at it" feeling.\n6) Almost every encounter can be dealt with jumping around HP/MP shrines.\n7) Weird animations. Peasants axing the ground? Scything the trees?\n\nPros:\n1) Really vast gameplay options. Magic? Pretty nifty. Summoning spells helped me a lot. Chaos Rage + Ressurection made lategame into somewhat long, but funny fights with your little armies killing their little armies. You can kill a guy, loot him and ressurect him into the fight (dont take his weapons though). Did not went for combat or archery, cuz i wont be going to play this again. Magic is really funny, honestly.\n2) Somewhat intriguing world. It is fun to explore it, thought the southern part and the desert are meh.\n3) Funny upgrading system. Xzibit must have taken part in it with all this "I put a sword on the sword to hit them with the sword while i hit them with the sword".\n4) Nice alchemy with your own concotions.\n\nOverall:\nIf you are all into gameplay - try it.\nIf you are looking the "R" letter in this RPG - dont ever look at it.\n\n","December 29, 2015","false","17.4"," 38 of 77 people (49%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","49","38","77","13","3"

Enemies come in packs of 3-6 which is difficult/tedious to defeat early on, so your best strategy is to stand by a revive shrine and fight with rapidly regenerating health. Later on you're broken because alchemy is overpowered in that it lets you make permanent stat potions from easily obtainable materials. That and you can stack gems on a weapon and make its damage obscene.\n\nThe real problem is the lack of quest markers. You know how you've probably played a game and thought "wow it's really lame this marker leads me right to the objective" Well, if you want to see why developers do that, try this game!!!!!! While there are quest markers most of them are to the person giving the quest and you get to wander around most of the time lost. Most of the directions are vague like "near" or "east of" and then not really either.\n\nThere's also really draconic DRM too which apparently only allows three installs. The game's playable I guess... I mean it held my attention longer than Morrowind in this day and age, but really it's quite poor quality unfortunately.","April 1, 2015","false","14.6"," 14 of 29 people (48%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","48","14","29","3","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/no13/recommended/1930/","no13","Lucky Thirteen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/no13/","340 products in account","One could say that for every two things  Two Worlds  did right, there's one thing it did wrong.\nIn my opinion, it still deserves a positive rating (especially since you can now get it for free on DLH.net), but let's talk about some of the aspects.\n\n\nThe in-game world is beautiful; full of interesting locations to visit and a variety of things to do.\nThere is also a simple ("simple" doesn't equal "bad", mind you!) skill tree, so you can choose your play style: an elemental wizard, a Necromancer, a warrior, an archer or even sort of a stealthy "bandit"... or a mix of them all, just like it should be in every decent RPG.\nSadly, there are basically no "flavor" dialogue options to go along with your character.\nYou can accept or refuse a quest, you can even choose whom you want to side with on multiple occasions, but you can only do it one way. The developers were reasonable enough to give the Hero a neutral attitude, but the "role-playing" part suffers from this.\nEven if it wouldn't affect the actuall outcome in any way, it'd be good if they gave us more dialogue choices.\n\nThe questing is fun at first, but as you are nearing the end of the storyline, it becomes a bit dull.\nThere are still many places to explore, but you sort of don't care anymore. The side quests aren't bad, they're just missing that little something, the twist that would keep you interested.\nAs a part of your questing, you can gain or lose reputation with multiple factions.\nThe only real benefit of having the max reputation with the factions, though, is to be able to do their quests and advance in the story (their merchants also give you more money for the things you sell them, but earning money is incredibly easy in the game anyway).\n\nThen there's the combat system.\nYou grab a weapon of your choice, distribute some talent points (which you get for doing various stuff thorough the game) and start slaying whomever and whatever needs to be slain.\nAs you eventually grow stronger, you'll start noticing that fighting is terribly repetitive.\nThere are monsters that require absolutely no effort whatsoever to slay, and there are monsters that are still fairly easy to defeat, but can kill you in one or two hits, so you have to kite them.\nAnd then there are archers who are insanely annoying to fight if you don't have any range weapon. Luckily, there aren't many of those.\n\nThe character models,  animations and the voice acting get criticised by almost everyone, but I had no big issues with those.\nOn occasions, the NPCs do sound a bit funny, but it happens even in modern games. It's not as horrendous as people claim it to be.\n\nWhat I did have a big problem with, however, was the lack of any sort of ending.\nAfter you have dealt with the bad guy in either of the two possible ways, the game just returns you to the main menu. Just like that.\nNo epilogue, no final cutscene, no further info on the in-game events, not even a glimpse of the Big Bad's (dis)graceful demise... nothing.\nHuge disappointment!\n\n\nAll in all, it feels as if the developers implemented a whole lot of great ideas, but none of them got enough attention to fulfil its potential.\nTwo Worlds  is still a pretty fine game, really worth your time  if you enjoy RPGs. It's just not as great as it could have been.\n","February 25, 2015","true","80.8"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

Nothing managed to grab me and want to keep playing, story seems boring and cliche.\n\nI normally try to play a game for at least 10 hours before writing a review, but the voice acting immediately put me off, sounds very robotic with no emotion behind the words, sounds like someone is bored and just reading the lines half heartedly straight off the bat.\nThe default controls are horrible as well, space for action and e for jump.\n\nAt least you can change it. Though I could not map shift to anything at all and trying to map the tilde key just resulted in opening a dialogue function.\n\nCharacter creation is extremely limited, you can only play as a male and change his hair and features a tiny bit.\n\nI do not need to play much at all to decide that I really hate playing this game. It's terrible in every way. Talking to NPC's is like a form of torture, listening to dialogue that sounds like someone is very bored makes me want to mute the sound.\n\nA waste of time to play such a bad game when there are heaps better games I can spend my time playing. I only have playtime more than an hour as I was trying to get all the card drops.\n\nBut if you feel the need to give it a try maybe get it on a sale. But to me this game is not worth playing even if it was free.\nI'd rate it 4/10 as it is not a joy for me  to play at all.","September 20, 2015","false","4.5"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

Not even close..\nNot to mention unlike TES games, once you beat main story, thats it. You can't continue the adventure with the insane sword you got from the boss.. noooo, cutscene, end. Can reload a old file before the bossfight, or start a new character.\n\nCombat was fun, was a basic evade button (Q) to jump back. With enemies that need different thing.

Normal weapons will take very long to kill.\n\nI also like, which they do not explain, how you strengthen your weapon and armor.\nEX. Say you kill some bandits, and they all drop the same sword, you pick them up, drag them to your sword to add more strength to it. Helpful with basic, but the more rare and powerful make take longer to increase.\n\nAll in all, great gameplay, good story, decent challenge, bad ending.\nSome bugs but I only seen a few.\n\nReplaying now as a archer.","January 24, 2015","true","40.0"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Where someone should be upset, they sound as upset as when your leg falls asleep.\n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nAs for the good stuff, I played a lot of skyrim, and some morrowind, and gotta say, the fighting animation is pretty cool. It isn't just swing your weapon around like a madman. So I did enjoy that.\n\nAlso liked the skill tree. Was simple and clear.\n\nDespite the terrible voice acting, the story wasn't bad. I enjoyed it, even if it wasn't the most clear sometimes of where to go.\nLike this. (Go south to Goat Cave.) When the correct direction is SouthEast, and is a small dot that says Active Underground as its name.\n\nNow liking the story only got me so far, not spoiling anything but the ending was not worth the last few battles.. Not even close..\nNot to mention unlike TES games, once you beat main story, thats it. You can't continue the adventure with the insane sword you got from the boss.. noooo, cutscene, end. Can reload a old file before the bossfight, or start a new character.\n\nCombat was fun, was a basic evade button (Q) to jump back. With enemies that need different thing. Like undead monsters are really only good to hurt with magic or enchanted weapons. Normal weapons will take very long to kill.\n\nI also like, which they do not explain, how you strengthen your weapon and armor.\nEX. Say you kill some bandits, and they all drop the same sword, you pick them up, drag them to your sword to add more strength to it. Helpful with basic, but the more rare and powerful make take longer to increase.\n\nAll in all, great gameplay, good story, decent challenge, bad ending.\nSome bugs but I only seen a few.\n\nReplaying now as a archer.","January 24, 2015","true","40.0"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

The voice acting is atrocious and the music forgetable. Your character can only be male, with very little customization. Its unbalanced and glitchy, with the horses having pathing issues constantly. The quest tracker is confusing, with no clear path to take or who to talk to, to progress in the story. That said, the story seemed boring, pointless and cliche'. The clunky controls are horrible, not the regular space for jump its 'e' and space is for action O.o. with the exception of the mouse in the easy, unrewarding battles. Spells in the game feel weak and unaffective. Its obviously geared more towards being an MMORPG. It has Reality Pump DRM and you have to input a key and activate before you can play the game. They want your name, address, telephone number and e-mail address. It seemed extremely over the top intrusive considering its on Steam and I'm not going to play the multiplayer part. I would recommend playing Skyrim instead.","October 30, 2015","false","5.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Though just slightly. It can be an enjoyable game. But there are many many many flaws. The biggest ones, are that the voice acting is abysmal. by far the worst ive ever heard in a game. The missions = go here talk to this person, then go here and talk to him, then go here and talk to her, and kill the same enemies every 20 feet or so. and its hard to figure out what youre supposed to do too. And the combat is bad. Not the worst mind you, but very bad. it consists of mashing the LMCB over and over and over while he spins the sword in front of you. It only flat out sucks when you try to kill an archer cause they run from you and chasing them is annoying as ♥♥♥♥. I wont list anything positive about this game. ill simply say this: There are better simillar games out there. some for the same price. Get dragon age, the witcher, dark souls, dragons dogma, or even fable over this game. unless you get it on sale for like $1.25 like i did. Unlike every other steam reviewer, i wont say that this game sucks. its simply inferior and falls into the shadow of much better open world RPGs. Rest assured that it isnt the worst open world RPG. that honor goes to risen 3. Cant decide between giving this game a 5/10 or a 5.5/10, But what i can decide on is that even though i got *some* enjoyment, i doubt many other gamers would, so i cant recommend this game to the general gaming public. Pick this up if its on sale for less than $2 or if youre just an RPG junkie like me.","January 22","false","9.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The beginning is very hard you have to take your time and build up be patient, dont dive into combat or you die. learn the jump back system for defense. The horse riding is better than any rpg ive played for realism, you can shoot your bow while riding horses. The combat system is very fun once you get comfortable with the way your character moves. THere is an ingenious way to stack equipment so nothing gets wasted and items lvl as they are stacked into eachother. There are hours and hours of content and side stories. The magic system is fantastic. This was due to buggyness rated as one of the worst RPGs but infact i find its one of the best RPGS now with the patching. I prefer this game over oblivion 10 to 1. The characters are more robust. Some people complain about the voice acting but its appropriate for the setting the old english. Also its nice to hear your character talk instead of read what he says as a mute as in most games.  There is plenty of element of exploration. This is a recommended must buy for anyone who likes skyrim,oblivion, gothic or any open world RPG 3rd person games. Also this game has some of the best looking armor sets ive ever seen in a game and the most veriety of weapons and items in any game to date.","December 12, 2013","true","78.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The voice acting is terrible, the combat is boring, the story was uninteresting, the starting lore is contrived and unoriginal, and riding horses is glitchy and annoying.

For what ever reason the Steam version of this game runs so smooth I forget that this game was notorious for choppy framerates, sluggish gameplay and other major bugs. The only issues I've had is with the controls which seem to be very MMORPG like (I've only played maybe 3 of em).\n\nWhen I don't have to have a second pause every four hundred feet and several massive glitches in a fight, I am so happy. When I can just run cross country at a decent clip and not feel like I'm slogging through mud when walking across a grassy field, I am so happy.\n\nIf you want to explore the "Oblivion killer" that wasn't, check out this title.\n\nThe gameplay is simple, just three canned animations for hand to hand combat. Using bows is damn near impossible for how long it takes to draw a bow and land an attack when your range is not even remotely realistic. Now, the majick system is neat and the other thing that really sticks out is the creepy incest laden story with the sister. Yes, it gets creepy at points, almost if TopWare couldn't decide if you were looking for your girlfriend or sister. Kari is dressed, well really hardly dressed, like she was coming from an evening out with her lover and not kidnapped while traveling with her brother.\n\nOver all, experience the game if you want to experience a B-Movie type of RPG.","September 23, 2014","true","9.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I love playing it and the quests are difficult but it kinda makes you think as you're running around fighting monsters how to solve problems and its a skill that can be used in the real world. Not everything in this game is just handed to you like most games now and its a good and bad thing. Overall this is a really good game expecially for this sale price. I definitely recommend this to a friend and i believe it even has online play. The horseback riding is kinda odd but when you really think about it, its more realistic than most other current games, horses won't just ride off a cliff in this and they wouldn't really in real life either. Its realistic in many ways, but nothings perfect.","December 13, 2013","true","11.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

The characters and story is interesting as well.

I do recommend this game  because it is pretty fun and by my standard of movie price entertainment this works. I certainly got $10 of fun out of the game. ( Admittedly i got the game for free but i did get 1/2 a movie of fun out of it at least )\n\nOnto the actual review.\n\nThe voiceover work and dialog is just awful. There are a few people who bring you in on thier VO but the main character will remove your suspended disbelief every time. He is awful.\n\nThe graffix and engine is 2009 get over it.\n\nHorse riding and combat sucks, there is a teleport system so cool.\n\nUnlike other games in this style enimies dont level up with and around you. You will walk into an area and get into a fight that is way beyond your characters ability. Know this. This is a game you are going to kite enemies. There is not a lot of 1 v 1 combat you will typically be fighting groups of things.\n\nThe systems are not explained very well and you will be googling a lot to figure out the things you want to do.\n\n7 Hours in and i intend to go back to this game ive started it a couple times over again after i discovered how to do this or that. All in all i think it is a pretty fun game, for gamers who have always had to re-write code, find answers for how to do things and in general become an expert at the game they are playing with no aforethought.\n\nI hope This review Helps you come to a decision.

But this game is quite addictive, and I really dont see anything wrong with the graphics. Nice enviroments, somewhat ugly animals but I can live with that. The human characters are a bit goofy but there are so many good things about this game that any not up to snuff eye candy is easily overlooked.

The single player mode is my favorite & if you have the time to invest in playing it & questing I think you will really enjoy it. If your looking to buy it to play with others I would suggest that you save your money & find another game where there are more players. The top amount of people I have ever seen online at one time was like maybe 4 but that was well over 6 months ago. Last week I say 2 players but they didn't speak & didn't seam interested in doing anything other then running around the lobby area where you wait to join games.\n\nIts a great game!\nIts worth the money if you buy it to play alone!","January 2, 2014","true","64.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's nice for once that a game could be abused by a more casual gamer.\n\n(Also, an Eastern 'area' in a serious med-fan setting? It's so messed up it's hilarious.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ericlippi/recommended/1930/","ericlippi","ericlippi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ericlippi/","146 products in account","I picked this game up in an RPG bundle on Bundle Stars for 5 bucks (As I'm writing this, that bundle is still  available.) I actually bought the bundle for Two Worlds II, but I figured if I played that one first, I would never go back and play this one, so I decided to play TW first.\nPerhaps it is because of this that through the whole game I had a feeling of wanting to just get it over with. At the beginning of the game I was getting killed by everything, and I just wanted to get it over with, then I got a little stronger and acquired some better gear, but I really just wanted to get it over with. Then I finally did get it over with, and I looked back on the 20 hours I spent on the game and thought “well, I’m glad that’s over.”\n\nI did miss out on the finer parts of the story due to skipping a LOT of dialogue because the voice acting is laughable and the on screen text is an odd “period appropriate” font which is hard to read.\n(This obviously was before the world realized that fantasy RPGs don’t need to have period-appropriate gothic fonts and HUDs with ornamental metal decorations around the mini-map and bars, and where the menus look like scrolls/notebooks)\n\nBut what the main storyline boils down to is basically a series of fetch quests, to acquire the different parts of an artifact which will help something something the tomb of an orc god something something the main characters sister something something bring the god back something something. It's not very interesting, but it's not horridly boring.\n\nAs I said, the main story is just some fetch quests. For me this just meant running past a bunch of enemies, grabbing the artifact piece, and running like hell to the nearest exit. Do this a few times, bring them all together, fight the bosses, game over.\nBUT there are also a slew of side missions to enjoy and different factions to be a part of. I chose to help out the necromancers and the merchants guild, but there are other groups.\n\n\nThe combat is alright with me, but it’s nothing special. For me it was equal parts slashing away with a weapon and pausing to switch spells. Not as stiff as, say, an Elder Scrolls game, with Two Worlds featuring automatic aiming and quick access bar which I never actually learned to customize except for the spells. Though the system was certainly not as entertaining as, say, the first Witcher.\n\nAs for the enemies on which you will be employing your combat, I thought there was a good diversity!  Though the RPG staple, “giant rat”, did not seem to appear (or I just didn’t notice) there are some quite cool enemies to do battle with. You have your standard wolves, skeletons, orcs, and bears, but also ghouls, zombies, dead knights and a  slew of others, all of which fight in different ways. There are creatures unique to different terrain, which is cool, and there are massively overpowered beings such as golems and hell lords (yes, HELL LORDS) walking around like they own the place. Overall, I was happy with the diversity of enemies. However, the minor boss battle at the end was an hour of me spamming the mouse button, and I hate that, though that may have something to do with me rushing though the game and getting to the boss before being properly leveled.\n\nI’m not going to talk about the magic or leveling system because I didn’t put a lot of time into it, seeing as I was breezing through the game.\n\nBut, of course, average mechanics can be made up for with a good story and atmosphere right? Well let’s talk about both of those.\n\nStory: It’s fine. It was underwhelming for me because, as is the case with these RPGs, the fate of the world was at stake, but I didn’t really care what happened to the characters in this world, because none of them were interesting or endearing. There’s something close to characterization in the relationship between the hero (you) and his sister, but it’s not really that engaging.\n\nAtmosphere: The world looks quite good. When you pop into first person view and look around, there are a lot of pretty landscapes to behold. All types of environments are represented here (Glaciers, fields, deserts, bamboo forests, lava-pits, big cities, small villages), and they all look pretty great, but they are sometimes inexplicable. A desert will abruptly turn into a field, and other things of the like. But though these landscapes are pretty, they are also quite empty. There are many expanses of wilderness which don’t have any interesting features, NPC’s or enemies. Overall, the atmosphere is of a world which is interesting, but it does not make me want to BE there, which is what I look for in an RPG world.\n\nAnyway, though my review is negative, I wouldn’t say that this is a horrible game. If you can get it in a bundle, as I did, it’s probably worth a play through, but only if you’re into the genre.","September 12, 2015","false","20.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","1","4","0","0"

Getting it to work is a nightmare!\n\nFirst you get constant startup chrashes, you find out by searching the internet that happens cause you need to install an old version of PhysX. Then you have to activate your game via internet or phone. Phone is not working and internet activation just doesn't recognize you having an internet connection or is giving you connection errors.\n\nYou can't cancel the connection searching process because (the button for that is not responding) even after the error message. The only thing you can do is go back to your desktop and close the game. Which doesn't close the TwoWorlds.exe in your task manager though.\nThat means you can't close steam properly and have to force restart your computer.\n\nIf you're really lucky your steam-client while being force shut down didn't log out properly and after the restart you can't log in cause it tells you your account is still online.... great :(\n\nAfter 3 hours I'm pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and still nowhere near to actually playing ... got the trading cards though","April 5, 2015","false","3.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vw1992/recommended/1930/","vw1992","WarHead","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vw1992/","339 products in account","I didn't even get past the main menu.\n\nFirstly, the game would CTD on startup until I got an old PhysX driver from the Nvidia website.\n\nThen the in-game cursor was stuck in place, but I could (extremely inconsistently) move an invisible one around. I tried looking for solutions on forums, but none of them worked. The one which would likely have helped (disabling hardware cursor in the options menu, it helped in the sequel) was unusable, because even after about 3 minutes of trying, I wasn't able to click the interface tab with the erratic invisible cursor.\n\nOpen world RPGs are notorious for being buggy, but I don't recall ever playing one where even the main menu was completely broken.\n\nCombined with a registration DRM, which pretty much asks you to fill out a resume, I have decided this game wasn't worth the hassle. Fortunately, I got it in a bundle, otherwise I would have been really mad.

All the RPG elements are there, and the game tries to give you freedom in your choices, which is also great. There's a ton of armor sets, and the map is frigin' huge.\n\nThat's all well and good, except it was all programmed by monkeys with keyboards.\n\nThe combat...oh my lord the combat is horrendous. Seriously, if you're gonna make a dodge mechanic, can I please control the direction in which I dodge? Remember MOrrowind combat? Yeah even this is 10 times worse than that. The visuals are gross, pixel-y, and look like a bad photoshop filter.\n\nHorse combat!? Im my MMO, oh please tell me they at least got that right...\nNope. The horse combat is ♥♥♥♥♥♥.

Thought to myself, "What a deal! I've always wanted to play this game it sounds so cool!", i was sorely mistaken after playing. The size of the download size had me worried, Not even 5 Gb. I woke up this morning stoked to play my new game. Open the game up, and what do you know, a ridiculous activation set up that you HAVE to do. it has the option to do it later, but tells you that you can only play the demo because you won't put in your personal information (I.E. Full name, address, gender,etc.) and is required. I still had my hopes high for the game, thinking that maybe it would be worth the activation hassel. Once again i was wrong. With no sort of tutorial, you are thrown into a place where you don't know the controls and don't even have some sort of direction to go. There is no marker or header telling you what do do. I finally figured out the controls enough to kill a couple guys with terribly choppy comabt and fluency.  Finally I find that the way out was where you started from...wait, what? Yep. Terrible design, no tutorial, no sense of direction, and choppy as balls combat. Maybe the open world will be waiting for me outside this tomb! got outside and was pleased with the evironment for a solid 3, maybe 4 seconds. Then i saw a bear. Well i think it was a bear, it kinda looked like a bear from a nintendo 64 game. Thinking, "Awh ♥♥♥♥, gunna go kill a bear since it's in the starting area!", as it comes running at me with it's 4 frame motion run, it ones hits me. In the starting area. Back to the tomb. Played for an hour, unbelievabley disappointed with this game. I think the PS2 game "A Bard's Tale" was much better than this game. It definetly had better combat fluency, that's for sure.","January 21, 2014","false","0.9"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

However with multiplayer out of the three available servers that are up, only one of them is working and its a EU server. From there the population of the server is near dead being at the most I have seen around being ten or less people.\n\nFrom there trying to connect with my friend to begin a game together became the problems. Both of us can start up and host a game but neither of us could ever join the other. We have tried every recommended step such as ports, dropping firewalls, bypassing routers, etc. Sadly I discovered that many others have had the same results with no solution.\n\nIf your looking to enjoy this game with a friend, sadly its a complete risk if it is going to work or not for you.

I start playing it in a Let's Play and it's fun to play, like a very bad movie is fun to watch.\n\nThe biggest issue with it is that it's almost unplayable. I had to install nvidia legacy drivers and reboot my computer to launch it the first time. Made 3 episodes of my let's play... Today I want to launch it again, but it doesn't want to :/\n\nAlso, when it's working, the game crashes a lot. For example I have to load my game while in window 800x600 mode (otherwise it crashes) and only when I'm in game I can go fullscreen with a higher resolution... The game made that easy since everytime I launch it, it's in window 800x600 mode again !\n\nAlso there's a very intrusive DRM that ask you where you live and stuff like that to activate the game. Apparently you can only install it on 3 different computers before having to ask the game staff to give you more activations. Unacceptable.\n\nConcerning the game itself :\n\n- The gameplay is kinda fun with some minor issues that stacked together ruins the game : you have to stand still to shoot arrows, melee combat is a random mess\n\n- Horses are cluncky as ♥♥♥♥: it's like driving a big australian truck (you can almost hear the BIP... BIP... BIP when you move backward). You can use bows while riding but let's just say you don't want to do that :D\n\n- It's not really fluid, voice acting is a disaster (on a furnitures commercial level), the story isn't good, etc etc...\n\nExcept if you plan to mock the game (and are okay to spend money for a game that will probably not run unless you spend 20-50 minutes on it), don't buy this piece of crap.\n\nThe game could be good if it was more polished and actually playable (the actual game would be very limit as an early-access title). What a waste :/","September 7, 2014","false","11.1"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

I had fun with this game. So why do I not recommend it?  Because it is not for most people. I'm kind of weird, because I love a lot of games many people don't love, so I like this, but not many people will.\n\nHere's why...\n\n> There are a lot of bugs and glitches, and it is very unpolished. Plus, it is not optimized for newer hardware, and at 1080p, has a bunch of render issues, and is overall a drag to work.\n> Many quests seem very underwhelming and, while it offers a lot of loot and "rewards," it doesn't seem that satisfying.\n> This game is a beautiful open world tarnished by crappy writing, poor optimization, and broken gameplay.\n> Gameplay is confusing and sometimes is broken.\n> Voice acting is terrible. Don't even bother with it.\n\nOverall, it is very dissatisfying.

I had fun with this game. So why do I not recommend it?  Because it is not for most people. I'm kind of weird, because I love a lot of games many people don't love, so I like this, but not many people will.\n\nHere's why...\n\n> There are a lot of bugs and glitches, and it is very unpolished. Plus, it is not optimized for newer hardware, and at 1080p, has a bunch of render issues, and is overall a drag to work.\n> Many quests seem very underwhelming and, while it offers a lot of loot and "rewards," it doesn't seem that satisfying.\n> This game is a beautiful open world tarnished by crappy writing, poor optimization, and broken gameplay.\n> Gameplay is confusing and sometimes is broken.\n> Voice acting is terrible. Don't even bother with it.\n\nOverall, it is very dissatisfying. Like I said, I still had fun, and I got this for $1 in an India Gala Bundle with a bunch of other, better games, so I don't have any buyer's regret, but I do not recommend paying full price for this.

The game starts in this temple place and you have no clue what is going on. Well, granted, I did skip the beginning cutscene, but still, it doesnt really explain much.\n\n3) Almost no character creation-Like, what's the point of this games character development? You can only change the hair style and color and facisl features of your character, but thats it, might as well be a predesigned character anyways.\n\nLastly, I could only stomach 30 minutes of this game. There is no map button, there is no easy way to block, the bar at the bottom of the screen doewssnt really work all that well.\n\nBonus-NO TUTORIAL!!!!!!!\n\nDo NOT buy or play this game!!","October 18, 2015","false","0.5"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

I have only had the Steam version for a little while; I paid a dollar for it, and I still feel like I was chumped for my money. Looking at the first few minutes of playing on Steam, I can already infer that the next several minutes will be worse than the first. This game is terrible; the models have little to no visible effort put into them, the interfaces' color scheme is extremely confusing, and MY OH MY, the weapon models... If you use a longsword, the weapon model GOES THROUGH YOUR CHARACTER... in the opposite direction.

It gets annoying as fast as the small enemy target areas which seem impossible to hit sometimes so it's a lot of button mashing. I bought it on the sale for $1.50 and that was all that made it worth it. Great graphics for its age, and it has some good ideas, but stay as far away from it as possible.

I want to, very badly, but I cannot. Yes, even for $2.50, not worth it. The Last Remnant is cheaper and a better challenge, no lie. Anyway, this is why this classic should be laid to rest.\n\nBefore I could even play the game I ha to download a special driver update because my Windows 7 cannot outwardly play this game. This is despite it being RECOMMENDED as a OS by STEAM. Fail. After the first fifteen minutes was scouring the internet for information I fnally got into the game. Two Worlds was made in 2007, so I forgave the awkward character creation system and lackluster options in hair styles and colors. Even the "great for its time" graphic rendering. For me, however, the big let down came when we got to gameplay.\n\nAnyone else take notice that it uses Diablo I font type? Like to the "T", I wonder if they paid for that font? Anyway, the voice acting began to remind me of a bad early 90's dubbed anime. The actors kept missing inflections of words and botching their lines 'emotionally' and it was just the opening scene! I get to my first objective, kill a few baddies and gain xp and again bad things happen. Three of them come at me, I fire a fireball at the first one then go to swap targets to attack the encroaching second baddie. Wait, how do you change targets? I almost die trying to figure this out and use the awkward "Q: jump forward, E: jump backward" dynamic to slay and burn my enemies to proper pulps and ashes.  Afterwards I take a quick moment to alt-tab to Google to find my answer. The answer? You cannot swap targets. Wait, what? Excuse me? A game that requires me to focus attacks and fight multiple monsters not only hasn't figured out how to "jump and direct" at the same time but doesn't have a simple TARGETING feature?\n\nI'm sure this game was great in 2007, the original Final Fantasy was groundbreaking. Now a days, however, there's so much more that could be and should have been done to this game. The dynamic of spell making and reputation systems are great, but it's really hard to get to that part of this game when it fumbles over every other step. I have Two Worlds II GOTY on my PS3 and a lot of these issues WERE handled. This is why, 2007 was a great year for TW, but not 2014 and not even for $2.50.","April 24, 2014","false","0.9"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","3","11","0","1"

So you grow stronger, until, in the end you feel like a god ( you fight the same monster, 5 - 10 in number )\n+ no puzzles ( i don't like them )\n+ simple but fun combat and spells\n+ stacking armors/weapons of the same type ( if you find armors/weapons of same kind you can just combine it for something stronger )\n\nWhat I didn't like\n+ if you use a horse, quick save because you could get stuck in some textures ( rarely but happens )\n+ awkward control with the horse\n+ some animations could have been better\n+ real doge ( you have a back dodge ), but a dodge controlled with arrrow keys makes the fight more dynamic\n+ end game too easy. I was a god in the end, pre-boss took 5 max hits, and boss 2  hits.\n+ game crashes ( very rarely but happens ). I suggest to use quick save.\n\nI recommend the game if:\n+ you are an action RPG lover ( dislike rpgs with quests where you get 3 flowers, etc )\n+ can make a compromise with some elements of graphics/animations\n+ don't like puzzles, because there are none in this game\n\nOtherwise, go and get it, you'll have a lot of fun\n\nCheers","December 23, 2013","true","32.6"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"

The animations might be a bit ropey but the visuals aren't too bad. The combat could have been done better and feels a bit dated, using the bow is pretty poor, but if you can look beyond it's faults there is a huge game for the tiny price.\nAlways liked the way you can combine matching items to boost them up (mouse over them in the inventory and if they match they turn green, then just drag 'n' drop). I would suggest using the 'jump-back' key to avoid enemy attacks and survive combat for longer though, especially at the start, and carry a mix of slashing, piercing and bashing weapons with different elemental upgrades. Horses have their own inventory, just stand next to them and get the panel up, use these to solve your storage problems by gathering a few around a teleport site. Doing this and having different ones for different item types makes it easier to collect armour sets etc and to keep matching items to combine them.\nHuge world, loads of locations to discover, tons of loot, vast number of quests, hacking down creatures while on horseback, if you want an epic rpg experience and give it the chance it deserves you'll soon find yourself ignoring it's failings and find a good game, get it at sale price and you can't go wrong.","April 22, 2014","true","10.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Doesn't look half bad either to be honest, even though it's slightly dated.

Only problem I see in it is that the game is dead so you want something fixed you have to either do it yourself our find the info from a few years back in the forums (Two World II is out, I would recommend playing this one first to get storyline though).\n\n8/10","January 6, 2015","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is dreadful and moves at the pace of a snail. I have never had any issues with the dialog, just press space and read the quest objective if you're so picky. The worst part of it is when you have become overpowered because of your insane permanent potions, sticking 2 swords together and rubbing gemstone on the blade sensually. It isn't that buggy, when your foe dies the ragdoll is amazing and may glitch. Monsters hiding inside walls (still killable from the right angle) and you accidently venture into some old mans sex dungeon and he bends you over a table and... (metaphor for getting owned by strong monsters). However, I still loves this game, it is senseless and fun and allows more freedom than so many other games.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thelolrusgamer/recommended/1930/","thelolrusgamer","The Lolrus Gamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thelolrusgamer/","176 products in account","Non-serious review:\nYou can just ressurect whoever you want when your air magic skill is full and you own the resurrection spell.\nEven your resurrected enemies go friendly and help you in combat.\nI murdered an entire village for necromancers... I resurrected all of them. They don't care that I killed them, or even acknowledged that I resurrected them...\n\nWent back to the necromancers and killed all of the necromancers except for one, who for some reason chose not to fight me. Even though he witnessed me murder all of his brethren, he still welcomed me... Killed him... Resurrected them all... Pretty much all of them are scared s**tless of me now...\n\n10/10\nWould resurrect everything (and betray people) again.\n\n\nSerious review:\n\nTo start of, this game is amazing. But, unfortunately, the cons mask the actual game. However, if you can get past those cons and ignore it, the game is actually one of the best RPGs I have played in a long time, and if the series was to come back with much better features and a more developed lore (the lore is pretty good though), it could actually rival the Elder Scrolls series. No joke.\n\nNote: The game starts of rather slowly and you're quite weak, but if you put the time and effort in you can become a tank. The best part is that even as a tank, you'll still find certain parts of the game difficult.\n\nPlot and basic story neccessary gameplay:\nThe plot's quite simple. It's a lets save a damsel in distress kind of story, except the damsel is actually your kidnapped sister and you go on some crappy wild goose chase to find her. Despite it being crappy and starts with some rather unneccessary bits, it's still actually quite good. One thing I like about this game is the fact that you can't just go and hammer the main quest straight through right away. You will be forced to do side quests and kill some more basic enemies to become strong enough to fight the enemies you will encounter on your adventures (Tip: Save when fighting hard enemies (At the start and mid-fight when you've taken a substantial amount of the enemy's/enemies' health down) and use the jump back ability to avoid the enemies swings. Powerful enemies can kill you with just one damn hit). Anyway, so your sister's been kidnapped by some weird mysterious cult like group and you try to track her down. You then get sent on quests by this cult to obtain items they want in return for your sister. Your character also comes off as quite an ignorant fool to the cult as he does not believe in the legend of his ancestors and his family legacy. The two endings are quite anti-climatic, but still fairly interesting. Oh, by the way, there is 100% no problem with this unless your somebody who gives a damn about being able to change your characters gender, but you have to be a man unless playing multi-player. There's no problem with that for me as I don't care about my character's gender in a game.\n\nGameplay:\nThe game features a fairly basic combat system but I still found it fun. I can't really go into much detail, but sometimes, fights do seem quite action packed. There is also a basic but interesting skill system, a developed alchemy system, and a simple but helpful weapon and armour upgrade system. The roleplaying system is quite basic but fun as well. There is also a faction relations system which is too easy to earn trust with but is a nice touch nonetheless. The multiplayer mode is basically just parts of the map from the single-player game (there are several to choose from) but with different quests and characters and it's playable with friends. It's essentially a free MMO thrown in with the single-player game. Or you can choose an arena mode which is much different and much like any other arena deathmatch game. Magic is also featured as a key point of the game. Quite a few bugs are bundled in with this game to give you the "man-we-must-have-rushed-this-on-a-cheap-budget-but-hey-it's-still-quite-good" feeling. And as mentioned above in the non-serious review... You can resurrect everyone... Like literally everyone... That's god damn fun!\n\nGraphics:\nWell, it's very mixed. The graphics are certainly dated but do sometimes look fairly attractive. Rarely, but they can. The render distance is horrible though. Just ewww, devs. I feel incredibly short-sighted and by that I mean the short-sighted kind that can only see objects randomly appear when close enough. Y'know, the kind which doesn't exist. *shivers* Er... Just thinking about it gives me the chills!\n\nMusic:\nActually really suprisingly interesting and engaging. It usually fits the atmosphere but can sometimes take a while to fit in (for example, I may have peaceful music on when fighting an enemy as I had just been adventuring peacefully for a while). The main theme (the name escapes me, unfortunately) really matches the game and it's plot. It actually feels like the depth of the song goes quite deep. Look it up on YouTube. It's really good. The finale music at the end of the game is really quite thrilling and action packed.\n\nVoice Acting and voice related content:\nSo this is the main criticism for the game, in most peoples opinions. But actually, not mine. I actually really enjoyed the almost always cheesy voice acting. It actually sometimes felt quite good! xD The player's voice is actually really bad ♥♥♥ in my opinion! Unfortunately, it is cheesy and can ruin the atmosphere, so that's a quite a con right there. I enjoy the way in which the developers thought of using old english such as "'Tis", "Mayhap" and "Pray". It really fits the medievel stlye of the game.\n\nGame world and lore:\nOne of the most amazing things about this game is the sheer size of the world. It's massive and really engaging. The lore is also incredibly engaging, in fact, there's so much I can't share it all with you. So I'll put in a few words of what it features:\nGods\nAncients\nMedieval themes\nRoman-like themes\nFantasy themes\nLot's of different kinds of enemies\nFaction relationships\nCivil war-like scenario (Skelden House vs The Karga Clan)\nOrc vs Humans scenario\nNecromancers\nMages guild (The Society)\nAnd much much more.\n\nPros:\nEngaging world and lore.\nNice gameplay mechanics.\nMassive world.\nAmazing music.\nCan resurrect eveything if you feel bad about killing things(!)!\n\nMixed:\nVoice Acting. The cheesy and bad voice acting gives the game some humour and does actually sometimes sound quite good, at least to me. The world's not supposed to be mega-humouress and it wasn't intentional, so it doesn't quite fit with the game, but it's still not awful. It could definitely be better though.\nBasic principles of graphics. Not too awful for the time this was released. (Well actually, they even updated the graphics at a later date to improve them as release graphics were awful).\n\nCons:\nRender distance. Seriously... That is bull s**t on modern hardware - in fact, even for the time of release it was awful...\nStarts a little too slow with player character development.\nToo easy to earn trust with factions.\nBugs... That s**t was completely unneccesary... You may not encounter them too often, but when you do... They're horrible.\nThe game crashed on me once... I had to restart my entire PC. :(\n\nOverall judgement\nFor time of release (with original graphics (I've only seen these in images though)): 6\nFor time of release (with improved graphics): 8\nNow: 7.5\n\nGive it a go when it goes dirt cheap on sale. I mean, I got it for £0.69 or something. One of the best purchases I have ever made. I did once play this game on the XBox 360 though.","March 6, 2015","true","39.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is Well worth the sticker price of US $9.99 . Two Worlds Epic Edition plays allot like the Elder scrolls or the Torchlight games. In play style, Two worlds feels like a simplified mix of the two styles. The voice acting is quite good as is the writing and quests. Gold is plentiful, Alchemy is fairly easy, and "crafting" is fairly easy. Inventory management is fairly easy suffering only from a few glitches common to most games - there never enough room and this detracts from gameplay. TW1 however makes it easy to teleport around to shops and sell your goods and get back to game play.\nTwo worlds 1 has its own small mod community over at www.insidetwoworlds.com/forumdisplay.php?f=3 IF you want to download one of the mods, I suggest using the Two world control panel - http://www.insidetwoworlds.com/showthread.php?t=26659 . TW also has a mod sdk and nice tools. TW1 really has not seen much mod authoring since about 2007-2008 and the forum while not deserted, lacks the excitement you find in Torchlight or the Elder scrolls games.

Ugh. But it distracts only a little. The controls are a bit odd, but thankfully you can customize some. There's a hotbar, but the F7 one is set, use one of the others to customize your own way. The storyline is playable, there's plenty of freedom to roam about. But make sure that you can deal with the wildlife... they tend to see you as something to kos if you are anywhere near them.\n\nTake the time to get the feel of fighting, it's not just a stand there and hit type of game. You need to move or you'll go down will little effort on the attacker's part. Upgrade your items as often as you can, grab what you can brew and make sure to be careful what you put together when your experimenting. There's all sorts of things you can make...\n\nAll in all, it's not a bad game, rough sure... but not bad. There's no comparing it to today's games, since it was made some time ago. But I don't think it got the attention it should have when it came out. There are lots of forgotten gems like this one out there. The new one Two Worlds 2 picks up some time after this one ends...\n\nI started playing it, but I wanted to find out the backstory to it. That's why I'm playing this one.

Fans of the Gothic series may find themselves at home in this expansive world.\n\nIf you think a game relies heavily on appearances (graphics, animations, etc), then this will not be a game for you, as the game clearly shows its age, even with the graphics maxed out. But if you can enjoy a game simply based on the game itself, give it a try.\n\nThere's a large variety of skills, weapons, and armor to really fit your playstyle. While there is no traditional blocking, you can dodge attacks by moving or hopping out of the way, making combat really focused on watching your enemy and taking advantages of their openings. And it can be VERY challenging.\n\nIn fact, most enemies will likely overwhelm you by either brute strength or numbers. The key is to not get hit. Essentially, by dodging and maneuvering around attacks, a level one character could take down ANYTHING with enough time and skill. The longer fights can get very intense, especially in one-on-one combat.\n\nSuffice it to say, Two Worlds Epic Edition is not a bad game at all. That doesn't mean YOU have to like it, but I encourage you to give it a try. If even $10 seems like too much for you to spend to try out a game, I suggest waiting for a sale.\nJust like with Two Worlds II, I would suggest sticking to the multiplayer if the singleplayer story doesn't interest you that much. The multiplayer allows you to create your own character with a good variety of options (including races and gender) and gives you large maps in which to go and quest! Guaranteed hours of fun, even if you play it alone. (Yes, you can enter maps by yourself in multiplayer.

The story is dreadful and moves at the pace of a snail. I have never had any issues with the dialog, just press space and read the quest objective if you're so picky. The worst part of it is when you have become overpowered because of your insane permanent potions, sticking 2 swords together and rubbing gemstone on the blade sensually. It isn't that buggy, when your foe dies the ragdoll is amazing and may glitch. Monsters hiding inside walls (still killable from the right angle) and you accidently venture into some old mans sex dungeon and he bends you over a table and... (metaphor for getting owned by strong monsters). However, I still loves this game, it is senseless and fun and allows more freedom than so many other games.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thelolrusgamer/recommended/1930/","thelolrusgamer","The Lolrus Gamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thelolrusgamer/","176 products in account","Non-serious review:\nYou can just ressurect whoever you want when your air magic skill is full and you own the resurrection spell.\nEven your resurrected enemies go friendly and help you in combat.\nI murdered an entire village for necromancers... I resurrected all of them. They don't care that I killed them, or even acknowledged that I resurrected them...\n\nWent back to the necromancers and killed all of the necromancers except for one, who for some reason chose not to fight me. Even though he witnessed me murder all of his brethren, he still welcomed me... Killed him... Resurrected them all... Pretty much all of them are scared s**tless of me now...\n\n10/10\nWould resurrect everything (and betray people) again.\n\n\nSerious review:\n\nTo start of, this game is amazing. But, unfortunately, the cons mask the actual game. However, if you can get past those cons and ignore it, the game is actually one of the best RPGs I have played in a long time, and if the series was to come back with much better features and a more developed lore (the lore is pretty good though), it could actually rival the Elder Scrolls series. No joke.\n\nNote: The game starts of rather slowly and you're quite weak, but if you put the time and effort in you can become a tank. The best part is that even as a tank, you'll still find certain parts of the game difficult.\n\nPlot and basic story neccessary gameplay:\nThe plot's quite simple. It's a lets save a damsel in distress kind of story, except the damsel is actually your kidnapped sister and you go on some crappy wild goose chase to find her. Despite it being crappy and starts with some rather unneccessary bits, it's still actually quite good. One thing I like about this game is the fact that you can't just go and hammer the main quest straight through right away. You will be forced to do side quests and kill some more basic enemies to become strong enough to fight the enemies you will encounter on your adventures (Tip: Save when fighting hard enemies (At the start and mid-fight when you've taken a substantial amount of the enemy's/enemies' health down) and use the jump back ability to avoid the enemies swings. Powerful enemies can kill you with just one damn hit). Anyway, so your sister's been kidnapped by some weird mysterious cult like group and you try to track her down. You then get sent on quests by this cult to obtain items they want in return for your sister. Your character also comes off as quite an ignorant fool to the cult as he does not believe in the legend of his ancestors and his family legacy. The two endings are quite anti-climatic, but still fairly interesting. Oh, by the way, there is 100% no problem with this unless your somebody who gives a damn about being able to change your characters gender, but you have to be a man unless playing multi-player. There's no problem with that for me as I don't care about my character's gender in a game.\n\nGameplay:\nThe game features a fairly basic combat system but I still found it fun. I can't really go into much detail, but sometimes, fights do seem quite action packed. There is also a basic but interesting skill system, a developed alchemy system, and a simple but helpful weapon and armour upgrade system. The roleplaying system is quite basic but fun as well. There is also a faction relations system which is too easy to earn trust with but is a nice touch nonetheless. The multiplayer mode is basically just parts of the map from the single-player game (there are several to choose from) but with different quests and characters and it's playable with friends. It's essentially a free MMO thrown in with the single-player game. Or you can choose an arena mode which is much different and much like any other arena deathmatch game. Magic is also featured as a key point of the game. Quite a few bugs are bundled in with this game to give you the "man-we-must-have-rushed-this-on-a-cheap-budget-but-hey-it's-still-quite-good" feeling. And as mentioned above in the non-serious review... You can resurrect everyone... Like literally everyone... That's god damn fun!\n\nGraphics:\nWell, it's very mixed. The graphics are certainly dated but do sometimes look fairly attractive. Rarely, but they can. The render distance is horrible though. Just ewww, devs. I feel incredibly short-sighted and by that I mean the short-sighted kind that can only see objects randomly appear when close enough. Y'know, the kind which doesn't exist. *shivers* Er... Just thinking about it gives me the chills!\n\nMusic:\nActually really suprisingly interesting and engaging. It usually fits the atmosphere but can sometimes take a while to fit in (for example, I may have peaceful music on when fighting an enemy as I had just been adventuring peacefully for a while). The main theme (the name escapes me, unfortunately) really matches the game and it's plot. It actually feels like the depth of the song goes quite deep. Look it up on YouTube. It's really good. The finale music at the end of the game is really quite thrilling and action packed.\n\nVoice Acting and voice related content:\nSo this is the main criticism for the game, in most peoples opinions. But actually, not mine. I actually really enjoyed the almost always cheesy voice acting. It actually sometimes felt quite good! xD The player's voice is actually really bad ♥♥♥ in my opinion! Unfortunately, it is cheesy and can ruin the atmosphere, so that's a quite a con right there. I enjoy the way in which the developers thought of using old english such as "'Tis", "Mayhap" and "Pray". It really fits the medievel stlye of the game.\n\nGame world and lore:\nOne of the most amazing things about this game is the sheer size of the world. It's massive and really engaging. The lore is also incredibly engaging, in fact, there's so much I can't share it all with you. So I'll put in a few words of what it features:\nGods\nAncients\nMedieval themes\nRoman-like themes\nFantasy themes\nLot's of different kinds of enemies\nFaction relationships\nCivil war-like scenario (Skelden House vs The Karga Clan)\nOrc vs Humans scenario\nNecromancers\nMages guild (The Society)\nAnd much much more.\n\nPros:\nEngaging world and lore.\nNice gameplay mechanics.\nMassive world.\nAmazing music.\nCan resurrect eveything if you feel bad about killing things(!)!\n\nMixed:\nVoice Acting. The cheesy and bad voice acting gives the game some humour and does actually sometimes sound quite good, at least to me. The world's not supposed to be mega-humouress and it wasn't intentional, so it doesn't quite fit with the game, but it's still not awful. It could definitely be better though.\nBasic principles of graphics. Not too awful for the time this was released. (Well actually, they even updated the graphics at a later date to improve them as release graphics were awful).\n\nCons:\nRender distance. Seriously... That is bull s**t on modern hardware - in fact, even for the time of release it was awful...\nStarts a little too slow with player character development.\nToo easy to earn trust with factions.\nBugs... That s**t was completely unneccesary... You may not encounter them too often, but when you do... They're horrible.\nThe game crashed on me once... I had to restart my entire PC. :(\n\nOverall judgement\nFor time of release (with original graphics (I've only seen these in images though)): 6\nFor time of release (with improved graphics): 8\nNow: 7.5\n\nGive it a go when it goes dirt cheap on sale. I mean, I got it for £0.69 or something. One of the best purchases I have ever made. I did once play this game on the XBox 360 though.","March 6, 2015","true","39.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/burshoo/recommended/1930/","burshoo","Bushro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/burshoo/","155 products in account","Graphics:\nFrom a mere visual standpoint, this teeters on the better end of "average". It has common problems of its genre and time, such as touchy ragdoll physics, lackluster animations (outside of combat), foliage that appears and disappears with movement, props that frequently expose unfinished portions of themselves, and way too much bloom. Enemies also sometimes appear from thin air when I enter an area too quickly. Compounding this is an odd sort of strobe effect on movement animations, that would not look out of place in Quake, that can directly influence gameplay (especially horses, but I'll get to that later). On the flip side? The world is deceptively large, and allows for long-distance observation, by not resorting to permanent hazy filters or ridiculously short draw distance, as well as exploration, to every nook and cranny between the large mountains that make up the edges of the map. This will take the player to plenty of locales, such as mountain forests, jungles, and deserts, each of which feels atmospherically unique. Combining this with intense visual effects and minute texture detail, this is a game that can and will look stunning when it really wants to.\n\nSound:\nAside from the simple sound effects, this game's audio is original Deus Ex tier, in both good and bad ways. Bad, in that the voice acting is pretty forced, but still tries hard to have its special charm, while delivering dialogue of a similar caliber. Good, as in the music is a combination of regular RPG ambience and stuff that's good enough to listen to outside of the game. Of course, you won't hear it unless you go to the settings menu and crank it all the way up. It seems as though somebody thought it was so embarrassing that it deserved to be hidden by generic enemy grunts and the main character's quipping, which is a shame because the music's variation, subtle undertones, strong meters, and bizarre instrumentation make it an absolute treat to listen to even when not playing.\n\nCustomization:\nImpressively deep, the game allows the player to toy with every aspect of his character, from looks to equipment. Armor not only includes variations by type, but variations within specific types, as well as an ability to combine identically-named equipment to produce stronger variations, and this is all on top of bonus statistics and resistances. Alchemy allows the player to brew potions and weapon upgrades from scratch. The magic system lets the player use spells that can be strengthened by adding more of the same type, using boosters, or using bonuses from other spells or pieces of equipment. This all congeals to create a character that uniquely fits the player's gameplay preferences, an experience I haven't had with this depth in a video game since Morrowind. Unfortunately, my feelings don't entirely extend to the skills list. While it is impressive to have so many skills, many of them are important parts for certain gameplay styles (the ability to silently kill enemies, for example), and some of these are locked at the beginning, requiring the player to conform to a different style until he comes across the NPC who will unlock said skill. The hotbars can also be a pain to set up.\n\nCombat:\nI found the combat to work fine in one-on-one situations, but the game rarely gives those out, instead focusing on battles against hordes of enemies which are often slowly beaten using a "one step forward, two steps backward" sort of approach that limits the depth that is readily available. Melee attacks are similar to those of the game "Enclave", putting animation in front of effectiveness, but here the problem is ameliorated slightly due to generally being directed at enemies even without specific directional commands, and still allowing movement during said attacks. This works to hamper the combat as well, though, as I sometimes find myself accidentally ttacking allies, or using the backstep when surrounded by enemies, which will launch me right back into them. Every other approach to combat seems to supplement the melee, as it can be challenging to get the range necessary to use bow exclusively, and magic is somewhat weak for the majority of the game. Towards the end of the game, where the difficulty takes a sharp increase, the clear lack of enemy scaling sets in, and many battles will become too easy, or too hard.\n\nHorses:\nGave it its own section because of how weird they are in this game. Mounted combat works well because of the extra range given to weapons while on horseback. However, the horses themselves can be hard to control. They have a tendency to steer themselves, regardless of which direction I want to go. At first I thought it was just an elevation issue, but it's also happened over small props and pathways. The "strobe effect" I mentioned earlier takes away some control when the horse is moving at slow speeds. Though the horse is often faster, I find myself walking on foot most of the time, because I know I can go over terrain that the horse will not.\n\nQuests:\nI don't mind a little investigation, but when confronted with a locked, unpickable door, I would at least like to be pointed in the right direction to open it. While the main story offers a great deal of freedom, going so far as to tackle the objectives in any order I wish, the sidequests often required to complete these objectives (and even those that aren't required) can be hard to figure out. For most of the experience, I am left with far more questions than solutions.\nIf I'm locked out of a faction stronghold because my reputation with them isn't high enough, can I at least be told where to find someone outside the stronghold who can increase my reputation? If I'm told to go into a cave as part of a quest, can I please open the door to get into said cave? If not, can I please be directed to someone who will give me the key? Is there a reason the NPC vital to this quest has not spawned yet?\nThis is how the open, choice-driven quest system shoots itself in the leg. A distinct lack of explanation can make it tough to complete some of the objectives without an outside source.\n\nFactions:\nThe faction system can barely be called as such. In short, it only provides small benefits that may not actually be reflective of the player's actions in the world.\nFor example, during the Karga-Skelden section, I sided with Skelden, and had to improve my rep with them. One such required quest told me to intercept someone who was stealing documents. I was not given a location, a name, or anything else. I decided to check a guide, which told me that the NPC would only spawn if I started a certain quest for Karga. So, I go to their stronghold, and the guy at the gate tells me to get lost. Clearly, he would not let me in unless I killed him, or had increased my reputation with Karga. Out of utter indifference, I kill him, enter the Karga camp, and start the quest to spawn the NPC I need. I obtain the documents, kill the guy who had them, and keep going with Skelden's quests. Eventually, this led to Skelden wiping out the Karga stronghold completely, allowing me to walk into the deepest part of their base and take the item I needed. It was at this point that I checked my faction relations chart, and noticed that my reputation with Karga was 2/10. As far as I know, every faction relation starts at 0 and cannot go any lower.\nReally? 2/10? I directly caused the events that led to the elimination of Karga, and they still think I'm a 2/10 human being? Like, what did I do to deserve those points? The one quest they gave me, I betrayed them.\n\nFor its flounderings in the major categories of combat, quests, and factions, I can understand why some people don't like it. Personally, I think that the depth, customization, and scale shines through, and even though there were some moments that infuriated me, there were more than a few moments at which I sat back and felt satisfied with what it did right. Good game.\nAlso, taint.","April 27, 2015","true","30.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Oh and what a game it was. I started off watching a cutscene, a guy and a gal on horseback, they needed shelter for the night, but when the man is checking a shack they find, he returns to the girl, who is nowhere to be found. I got impatient and skipped the cutscene at this point to get to what I'd been waiting for the past few months. This was a mistake. I start in a cave with no reason, and I find and kill little goblin men with sword skills like a jedi and suddenly shoot fire from my hands. I leave the cave and skip a ton of dialogue from a man outside of the cave who at first I thought was an enemy, since every npc has a red name above their health bar. I pick flowers and discover a bear. This bear is a hard ♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I can't fight him on my own, so I lure him into a town so the peasents can fight him for me.

How the heck are you guys emphasizing the concept of alchemy and combining items so much when you don't even have anything that help maximize its capability.

If you are a person who is picky about the gameplay, AI intelligence, etc... then i would admit that this would probably make you want to play another game rather than spend time playing it.\n\nHowever, If you are just looking for a game to explore an open world type of RPG and can create your own adventures without playing a linear story, then i would definitely recommend this as i had a fun time myself just doing what i wanted.\n\nI must admit though, that the horse can be stubborn when going down certain hills or at certain edges of terrain sometimes and the game has crashed once or twice whilst i was in the middle of saving but it was one hell of an adventure.  At the end of it all, for me, i found out that i could summon two times the amount of any and every creature i wanted (at least 6 types of creatures at one time though there is a max limit) whilst i was against the last boss but i think you can do the same anywhere anytime as long as you unlocked that specific water magic spell.\n\nOverall, this was worth it for me because i did what i wanted and not had to stick to the story line to get the relic stones (I rode all the way down to the bottom of the map at the beginning and slaughtered a few bandits, dead knights, beasts and orcs along the way).  I would recommend it for open world adventurers (who would just like to have fun whilst fighting unknown dangers) and first timers who are new to open world RPG games just so they can have a taste of what it's like.  Also, there's no harm being the bad guy in a game and going against the rules with power in your control every now and then.  :)","February 29","true","98.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The combat could have been done better and feels a bit dated, using the bow is pretty poor, but if you can look beyond it's faults there is a huge game for the tiny price.\nAlways liked the way you can combine matching items to boost them up (mouse over them in the inventory and if they match they turn green, then just drag 'n' drop). I would suggest using the 'jump-back' key to avoid enemy attacks and survive combat for longer though, especially at the start, and carry a mix of slashing, piercing and bashing weapons with different elemental upgrades. Horses have their own inventory, just stand next to them and get the panel up, use these to solve your storage problems by gathering a few around a teleport site. Doing this and having different ones for different item types makes it easier to collect armour sets etc and to keep matching items to combine them.\nHuge world, loads of locations to discover, tons of loot, vast number of quests, hacking down creatures while on horseback, if you want an epic rpg experience and give it the chance it deserves you'll soon find yourself ignoring it's failings and find a good game, get it at sale price and you can't go wrong.","April 22, 2014","true","10.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Personally I think of it like a separate series of game, and I like it. It's a big and solid game with lots and lots of content, and many hours of enjoyment. Doesn't look half bad either to be honest, even though it's slightly dated. There's also community patches to fix certain aspects of the game I believe, since the developer has most likely stopped patching the game all together.

Being a conniseur of the truly awful and noble defender of that which is unjustly labeled so, I must say that this is indeed a good game.  It is not an Elder Scrolls game, nor does it try to be.  It is however a fun game.  the unique item upgrade system whereby stacking an item on top of an identical item makes a stronger item.  This made looting more fun and strategic, do you lose the weaker sword in favor of the better sword? or do you keep the weaker sword because you know it's more common and could be upgraded to be more powerful than the better sword?  Weapons have slashing, bashing, or pearsing damage.  And enemies have different resistances to each, and not mild resistances either, it's a case of 'look it's a skeleton, should I use (A) a sword and half a dozen health potions and kill it in about 15-30 hits, or, (B) a club no potions and kill it in 2-3 hits.\nIf anything, the game reminds me of an open world titan quest with 3rd person view and WASD movement.\nTons of side quests and one of the only games where being the brave hero type can screw over innocent people.\n\nThis game is often on special and it only cost me $1 something.\n\nBuy it, relax and have fun.","October 5, 2015","true","47.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Bad.\n\nSo bad that the single player is entirely not worth it and beyond saving- there's no point to playing it, and as many has said before the voice acting is awful and characters not at all memorable.\n\nBut that has somehow not made this game a terrible purchase for me. You see, I bought three copies of it while on sale for ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles once I saw the multiplayer tag, expecting a few hours of cheap laughter and something to bash on.\n\nI got exactly that and more. The combat is -just barely- engaging enough to drag you in, but broken enough to be completely conquered by several players together, at low levels. I've related all the dragging and running from monsters and the fact that melee combat is awful at lower levels to being rather realistic. It's like some strange dark comedy where you run from hordes of wolves, bears, undead, grom, and ghost bears to take to the towns people who of course mob upon it and destroy it in seconds. But while doing this, you'll of course start to grow and gain more and more experience, levelling up in a sort of Dark Souls manner. In fact, the combat of the game sort of reminds me of the souls games, like a simplified version without repostes or other mechanics- but a dodge and parry button can be used, and it can be used well enough that there's a skill cap to melee combat. And you can mold your character however you want past the beginning much like in Dark Souls as well- you want to be an ice mage wearing huge armor? Sure. Sneaky necromancer who stabs people with a spear? Absolutely. It might not hold your hand and it certainly won't be fair at times but that can be forgiven with the strangely mesmeric depth of character possibilities and gameplay on several open world maps, even if you can't change their appearance to begin with past a few sliders that make no sense. For the sake of difficulty, I'd recommend starting as a magic class and then change into whatever you like later on- equipment has no restrictions except for stats and many spells just need a few points into their respective fields of magic. And somehow the game keeps things refreshing even if you lose all progress on a map when you exit the multiplayer session (you can, of course, unlock many maps through progression of the multiplayer and pick up on those irregardless) by having the enemy spawns and loot be interchangeable. One time a encampment of orcs happened to have a sand dragon instead of its usual, far over levelled and idiotic to fight. But we killed it and took its mediocre loot with a sense of accomplishment. Dying means nothing in this game as spawn points are everywhere and they heal you- but it still has managed to be fun?\n\nThe setting is easily laughable and the characters forgettable but this is a game I can find myself recommending to play with multiplayer and a few friends. It's just enough of a clone to many well known games that you can find yourself having fun while breaking and bending it to your whim. As an example, animals are afraid of many fields of fire magic and you can also easily stun lock enemies with the water magic's AOE capabilities forever, even if when they take damage they unfreeze. Me and my friend has somehow made this challenging in unexpected ways and still had fun seeking adversity. Don't take yourself seriously while playing this game- imagine it like some poorly made table top game that your little sibling/relative made to impress you but somehow manages to entertain you at the same time despite its broken aspects.\n\nAll in all, the singleplayer is worthless but the multiplayer is a surprising gem with qualities of Dark Souls, Diablo stye looting, and Oblivion small open world maps with quests to deal with. I can't recommend the full price but you absolutely should pick it up on sale for five bucks a copy- it's like a cheesy movie you'll find yourself enamored with.\n\nAlso, it charmingly included alchemy into a multiplayer game and that seems rather cool to me.\n\nTLDR: Buy it on sale for five bucks or less to play with your friends who all have hamachi. You'll get some time of entertainment.","October 24, 2015","true","9.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you are a person who is picky about the gameplay, AI intelligence, etc... then i would admit that this would probably make you want to play another game rather than spend time playing it.\n\nHowever, If you are just looking for a game to explore an open world type of RPG and can create your own adventures without playing a linear story, then i would definitely recommend this as i had a fun time myself just doing what i wanted.\n\nI must admit though, that the horse can be stubborn when going down certain hills or at certain edges of terrain sometimes and the game has crashed once or twice whilst i was in the middle of saving but it was one hell of an adventure.  At the end of it all, for me, i found out that i could summon two times the amount of any and every creature i wanted (at least 6 types of creatures at one time though there is a max limit) whilst i was against the last boss but i think you can do the same anywhere anytime as long as you unlocked that specific water magic spell.\n\nOverall, this was worth it for me because i did what i wanted and not had to stick to the story line to get the relic stones (I rode all the way down to the bottom of the map at the beginning and slaughtered a few bandits, dead knights, beasts and orcs along the way).  I would recommend it for open world adventurers (who would just like to have fun whilst fighting unknown dangers) and first timers who are new to open world RPG games just so they can have a taste of what it's like.  Also, there's no harm being the bad guy in a game and going against the rules with power in your control every now and then.  :)","February 29","true","98.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Which is lame. Kind of like the skyrim and other open world roaming RPGs. Very cool. Hard at the beginning with no skills/class. But once you have a few levels, it gets much easier. Unlike the elder scrolls series of games, this one has very little monster scaling. Meaning, you face the same difficulty of mobs on quests/missions regardless of your level. (random mob spawns do seem to scale with your level a LITTLE).","September 29, 2014","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
