Decay and destruction were all around. My allies from 3089 were nowhere to be seen, instead replaced with golden robots; and we seemed to be surrounded by a mysterious force of purple robot enemies. I talked to one of my new allies, and found them to be jaded and cynical about our predicament -- apparently we all worked for some new tyrannical "Master", and the Overlord was spoken of like a dim and distant memory or a half-remembered legend. This wasn't the Xax I remembered from 2000 years ago...\n\nGameplay wise, anyone familiar with 3089 will immediately recognise that the basics haven't changed much. In fact, nothing has really been removed from 3089 -- some mechanics have been replaced with more in-depth versions, but all the things which made 3089 great are still there to enjoy. You build your character from a variety of skills to suit how you'd like to play, find and wield a range of equipment to get the abilities you want. Everything you encounter is procedurally generated, and how you tackle each challenge is entirely up to you. Brute strength, stealth, leadership, strategy and speed are all viable tactics, and you can mix and match any combination of them.\n\n5089 has a richer and more developed story which ties into the other games in the series -- you don't need to have played them to understand 5089, but there are cool easter eggs for people who have. Talking with the robots for missions leads to some interesting situations; and of course there's backstory on disks and Dcubes too.\n\nThe major difference is the territory control mechanic. In 3089, capturing bases was a cool "side mission" you could do to get a safe base in a faraway region. In 5089, you need to expand your influence in order to access more advanced regions. I mean, it's possible to play the entire game using only level 1 gear if you want; but if you want more advanced gear then you'll need to either take it from enemies or take over bases (plus a few other sources of Conversion Points) to access their shops. To help with this, you'll be given new conversion equipment each time you complete a quest from a Quest Station, and if the idea of clearing out purple bases isn't appealing then you can always bring some friends along to do the dirty work for you.\n\nSpeaking of bringing a friend along, 5089 supports full co-op just like 3089; and has improved networking features including automatic port-forwarding via UPnP to make it easier to set up a multiplayer game.\n\nThere's a lot to go on about regarding this game, but to wrap this up before I go on any longer, 5089 is pretty darn great. Whether you're new to the series or a long-time fan, you'll find plenty to enjoy in 5089. phr00t has gone back to the original formula (which was pretty good already as far as I'm concerned) and updated, expanded and generally improved upon it. Whether you call 5089 a sequel, expansion, continuation or successor game; it's definitely a worthwhile experience in its own right.","February 3","true","19.7"," 69 of 81 people (85%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","85","69","81","18","11"

It's super hard if you become a hardcore base acquiring adventurer.  If you want to cruise around your base riding a hoverboard and taking giant floaty jumps over stuff there's that.  If you want to sneak around and stealth kill your enemies, that's an option.  If you want to jump in a plane and fly around go ahead.\n\nThis is a very surreal open world space where everything is randomly generated.  The bases, buildings, quests... I loved 3089 and put a lot of time into it but I've realized now that I barely scratched the surface.  5089 expands on 3089 and gives you even more things to do.  You make your own fun here.  If you just want to buy a hoverboard and cruise around the world, trying to surivive, go for it.  If you want to build up your guy to become super powerful or stealthy or stealy or whatever, there's a lot of room. 5089 is hard but I've never been too mad at it for beating me up.  I still don't think I know what I'm doing but I keep going back to 5089 instead of starting up Fallout 4 again.  That says a lot\n\nThe game is inexpensive and there's even a loyalty discount from owning 3089.  Word of warning.  This is not Skyrim or Deus Ex or Fallout.  This is a one man show and the look of Phr00t's world is not ever gonna compete with games built by thousands of artists.  It doesn't matter though.  It's consistent, functional and weird enough that it's very  engaging.  If the screenshots make you nervous, stay away.  This is all about the gameplay.  Bottom line here is that this is another Phr00t game and his stuff is outstanding.  Support a great dev that makes really weird and entertaining games.","February 21","true","19.0"," 27 of 27 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","27","27","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wuffell/recommended/414510/","wuffell","Wuffell","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wuffell/","955 products in account","A few hours into the game, 5089 seems to have all the best parts of 3089, and some new mechanics. It adds control points to expand your areas, which is a pretty good feature. It encourages strategic goals, instead of just trying to kill stuff. In practice it was hard for me to understand the control point system, but that's mostly because I ran into a bug. Go to the top of the tower, kill the boss and that's sorted. My trouble was due to a bug where the boss didn't spawn.\n\nThis game has a ton of random elements, including the map, equipment and quests. This variety means no two games will be the same, even if the overall goals are still the same. Unless you delete your character and create a new one with the same character name! Then it shares the same world. Still, there's tons of randomness in the equipment drops, so you can collect for a long while before you're happy with your equipment. Somehow the game doesn't feel grindy, probably because the action is quite intense.\n\nThe graphics are done in a specific style and some people will think the graphics aren't good enough. If you're worried about this, simply watch the video to see if it's good enough for your liking.\n\n3089 encourages slow play, and punished players who tried to complete too many of the boss challenges too quickly. I haven't confirmed it's the same here, but I'm guessing that's the case. Don'y try to play this game quickly. Instead, do the quests, get more equipment and improve your character, and worry about the rest later.\n\nThe music is excellent and really appropriate too, which is a really nice touch.\n\nAt the start, I find it's useful to put a few points in Prestige. For your first game, I would highly recommend starting with a few points in it, perhaps even try the Leader class. Then you can have other robots following you around and help you. Walk right up to them and interact with the robot and they will follow you, subject to a few conditions like your prestige value and the number of robots that are already following you.","February 3","true","6.5"," 27 of 34 people (79%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","79","27","34","10","2"

It's got only the stuff going on that works well, basically. If a major developer bought this concept more or less as is and just changed it by adding higher quality assets and making it more multiplayer friendly, feel like it would have major hit potential. As it is it's gonna be loved by the folks that seek out these great indie gems - if you liked any of the following games, you might find something to like here:\n\nS.T.A.L.K.E.R. series in that it evokes similar inventory management and "rpg lite" inventory features like combining items (gun parts, armor parts, ... etc. parts)\n\nA.I.M. series in that it involves a lot of randomly generated objectives and rewards, and features speedy and somewhat floaty movement with moderately durable, and varingly dangerous robotic opponents (feel like this might have been a big influence on the game if the creator has played the series)\n\nMinecraft and other randomly generated geography games because, well, randomly generated geography (which is highly traversable and fun to get around, well done to the developer phr00t for that)\n\nSystem Shock 2 in the FPS RPG player character development mechanics and also another one I am reminded of by the way you handle inventory\n\nObsidian massive singleplayer RPGs for a lot of the "creative" problem solving in a 3D rpg kinda game and also some hints of Elder Scrolls in the combat\n\nBorderlands series for weapons made of randomized parts (extends to all gear and makes customization something you'll do fairly regularly, which reminds me more of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games than Borderlands - I was always popping silencers on and off in the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games but I do think the weapon construction is more inspired by Borderlands since both games feature heavily randomized stats and item rarity for weapon parts)\n\nand I'm sure others, it's a really neat thing you have here. With Steam's refund policy, I feel like there's plenty of time to feel whether or not you'll click with the game - I feel like most gamers will figure out within a few minutes if it's going to be a fun play experience.\n\nThe graphics are only alright, but everything is very crisp. I'm playing on a 2D monitor, and the game looks like it would be crazy cool in VR so I wish I had that, haha.\n\nHighly recommend the game, very affordable price for a rewarding and smartly made indie FPS / action RPG.","February 25","true","33.9"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","15","15","0","0"

When I tried playing the game for the first time I was really confused about how to play it and only played for a short time before giving up.  Thankfully I didn't give up and forget about the game.  I read about the game play tutorials that were availabe and watched the VR tutorial to better understand how to play.  After that I tried the game again and it was a completely different experience.  When confusion over the controls wasn't in the way the sheer FUN of the game shined through.  Raiding an enemy base and physically leaning around corners to shoot the enemy robots really makes for a visceral experience.  It really is a VERY FUN game in VR.  If you find yourself confused when trying to play if for the first time, don't give up on it!

However, you do NOT need to have played any of the previous games to enjoy this one, and if you dont care about story I would actually suggest just skipping to this one (or 4089 if you prefer the look of the gameplay). I do have an old review of a previous game on my page that describes the style of gameplay, but I don't no how helpful that would be when there are plenty of better reviews on this page. The grappling hook/hoverboard/other movement options are all REALLY fun to play around with while taking potshots at enemies, so if you want you could play it like Just Cause. Oh, and pro tip: If it ever does feel like it's getting grindy, do something to progress the story, kill a Surveyor for surprises, or change the type of equipment/playstyle you use.\n______________________________________________________________\n\nI decided to play for a while before reviewing, in case my knee-jerk reaction was too strong. And the game really holds up to all the hype that me and probably all of a dozen others felt. As a sequel to 3089, it excels; the story of the planet Xax continues, and is as interesting as ever, with multiple endings and all, though I wouldn't consider the story to be a selling point; and the game itself is in the same open-world style as in 3089 and the obsolete 2089 (or was that 3079?), choosing not to follow 4089 which departed from tradition.\n\n[EDIT May 4th 2016]: Damnit, looks like I didn't wait long enough to review. I spent a lot of time messing around like it was Just Cause 2 instead of progressing, so I didn't see that THERE IS a lot of new content, in the form of new and improved enemies. The rest of my review still holds true, 5089 is an awesome sequel to 3089. Now that I think of it, I should probably add a note at the top for people who haven't played any of the other games. [END OF EDIT]\n\nI'll be honest here, the game seems pretty similar to 3089- It can feel like the same game at times, but vastly improved (Though that can be said of many sequels). The biggest differences to me are mostly technical- The game runs much better, multiplayer is much improved, the stats/weapons are better balanced, and like 4089 the game has complete VR support. Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of new items/mechanics, but unless you go out of your way to make a character that uses the new weapon/equipment, they have a minimal effect on gameplay despite being very fun to mess around with. Of course, the developer is still improving the game, now that he has player feedback, so expect bugfixes, balance tweaks, etcetera, every once in a while (every couple days right now, since the game is new). Speaking of that, the developer is very active in general, he even answers most peoples questions in the discussions board.\n\nThe last thing I need to say, is that the game might just not be for some people. If you don't know if you'll enjoy it enough to be worth buying, then I really recommend trying the demos and/or the other games first. Try watching a video on YouTube maybe. Oh, and if the graphics are what's making you hesitate, know that you really do get used to them if they bother you.\n\nThere, not a very cohesive review but hopefully it's helpful.","April 29","true","266.8"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","1"

Along your way, you will meet some very "unique" robots that will help you complete quests, or grind you into a fine powder and inhale your Defense lvl 12 ♥♥♥. The combat mechanics work great and the game feels very balanced. Your character has a wide range of skills, from being able to turn invisible and sneak past enemies to knowing how to pilot jets. Every single piece of gear is procedurally generated and can be crafted out of some base parts and reassembled to work however you want to. You can take a few different rifles and mix-match them and make a dual-barreled heat-seeking sniper. This also works with armour and chips. You can install computer chips into your character, and they act sort of like wildcards. They give you skill boosts, and you can reconfigure them if you have the right programming level. There are also random items called "Utilities". There are hoverboards, gravity-guns, teleporters, black hole guns and more. There's also building in this game, and it's pretty much limitless. If you want, you can repair some of the damaged houses or bases, or make your own. You can build teleporters and crates to store your goods, and sensors to detect nearby enemies. There's quite a lot in this game, and I missed a lot of it, so here's a\n\nlist of things it has:\nFPS, RPG, Open-world, jets, fully customizable weaponry, fully customizeable gear, lasers, robots, factions, secrets, procedural EVERYTHING, hoverboards, gravity guns, building, weapon/gear crafting, large bases/kingdoms, computer parts, ghosts, giant tesla coils, & more\n\n**EDIT**\nRecently I've been doing some playing and noticed some bugs. They never stood out to me in my previous world, but now they seem more pronounced. One of them is enemies spawning somewhere in a base section that I cannot find and kill. They're either spawning under ground or in objects, niether of which makes sense because enemies seem to spawn after the world is generated. But they're definately somewhere and they're definately not able to be attacked. Also, the game will sometimes crash if you loose focus and do something in another window.\n\n----TL;DR mark----\nPros:\nFully customizeable gear\nPlenty of content\nEverything's procedurally generated\nOpen-world\nBalanced\nWitty/Snarky robots\nWorth the money\nIt'll run on a potato hooked up to a battery and some RAM\n\nCons:\nMeh graphics\nRain seems to slow the game down significantly with certain settings\nRepetitive soundtrack\nTutorial could be better\nA little buggy\n\nAmazesauce game, feels like Mercenary Kings X Cube World X Borderlands w/ old graphics\nThis is one of those games that whatever you think should be in a game is probably in this one.","March 20","true","30.5"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","82","14","17","10","1"

I bought it because I wanted to play it with my HTC Vive.\n\nPlaying it with the Vive was difficult and somehow strange. I began with the Roomscale mode where you have to teleport with the ball you can shoot. Not the best way to move because it's very difficult to move around and dodge in combat. Also you pretty much always teleport somewhere above the ground.\nThen I tried the mixed mode because I've been immune to motion sickness from the start (lucky me). Moving with this was much better but it definitely takes some time to get used to it. But in this mode I hovered about one meter above the ground. Aiming and shooting with the motion controllers is great. But the melee attacks seem to be buggy. I know you have the two options to attack an enemy with the right motion controller but that somehow pretty much never worked for me. I just managed to hit a target with two swings. With all the other strikes my weapon went just through the enemy's body and nothing happened at all (but it works perfectly when playing it with a monitor + keyboard and mouse). Hopefully this gets fixed soon.","May 5","true","3.4"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","2"

Obviously, you can't take on the boss from the start, so you need to choose and complete randomly-generated quests that will provide you with skill points that you spend on different stats depending on what you want your bot to be strong at (mine, for example, is good at stealth and guns, making those cloaked shots, deadly).\nThere is also a weapon crafting/customization system where each weapon is a combination of parts, each one with it's attributes that you have to manage by exchanging less good parts by others you buy or find, making the weapon closer to what you want it to be.\nThere are also utilities and gadgets that, without spoiling anything, will make you discover interesting and fun combinations that you will certainly want to integrate with your playstyle.\n\nFor people who played 3089:\n\nFor better or for worse, I had a defined gameplay cycle (for 3089) was: Set Backup(savepoint)->Complete Quests->Get best possible weapon in that area->Get new "gadgets"->Move into a higher level zone\n\nThe biggest change apart from the story, are the unpowered stations.\nAs of yet, I am not a big fan of that mechanic. Perhaps because I used to grind for credits on my level zone and then go as further away as I could to buy a high level weapon so I could return and pave my way through quests. Now, you have to search for violet buildings and clear them so you earn enough points to be able to unlock the stations that sell weapons. I guess it gives more purpose to exploration but it makes me feel a bit stuck, especially when the first two building I found (due to the not perfect procedural generation of the map), were partially underground, covering all access to upper floors, making them virtually unconquerable.\n\nThe UZI is a damn fine addition, although it is weaker than the other weapons, the full auto shooting makes a difference for the best, at least for me.","February 3","true","4.3"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","15","20","0","4"

I will compare this to 3089 and 3079.\n\nCombat: Guns are 2 types, energy and ammo. Energy takes energy (No duh), ammo takes ammo. You can buy ammo at weapon shops and find it. There is no Certain gun only ammo, it works for all guns. Unlike 3079, guns have a clip. You can only shoot so much before waiting a few seconds to reload. This rule also applys for energy weapons. Holding right-click with a sword charges a dash attack that may do more damage.(I don't know if it does...) That can be used to kill flying enemies. Weapons have stats that have multiple effects. Swords can reflect shots, corrode,(Corrode = Poison) stun, and a few more I think. This can also apply to guns.\n\nCrafting: Killing enemies can drop parts. Parts can be combined at a workstation to make guns if they are the same type of gun.(Can't put a dagger blade on a sword hilt) Some parts are better than others. Weapons have an overall level. Level 1 weapons can have a level 3 part if I remember correctly.\n\nSkills: The skills are Stamina, Defense, Energy, Agility, Guns, Melee, Stealth, Prestige,Programming, Consumables, Pilot, and Stealing. Stamina is health, Defense is damage you take per shot, Energy is maximum energy, Agility is Max burden for running and jumping. You can still run and jump when over burdened, but it will be slower. Guns is gun damage, same with melee. Stealth is how fast you get detected when in stealth mode, Prestige is lower prices, more and stronger followers, Programming is better results when modding chips,(talk about that later) Comsumables is how effective comsumables are, Pilot is piloting better vehicles, and Stealing is better change at stealing. That run-on sentence, wow.\n\nEnemy Bases: Enter enemy base,kill all enemies in the square, use convert chip, repeat with expantion chip. But now, there is Convert points. They power the gear in enemy bases so you can use it. When you raid, a lot of gear will be turned off meaning you can't use it. That's all I can think of for this right now.\n\nStations: They explain themself, Armor, Weapons, Quests, Workstation, Chips, Health/Energy stations. But, Utility stations are the cool grappling hooks, Black holes that hold people in place, hoverboards, Gravity guns, Decoys and Teleporting Cube Gun. Also, grappling hook dont take you out of stealth unlike 3079.\n\nBuilding: I Never really built outside of messing with it to see how it works so... I don't really know.\n\nI would write more but I really don't feel like it, cause it still need to explain; Aircraft, Time stopping, Gun types. Few others I can't think of. Go read another review or just look up gameplay.\n\nTL:DR Its fun and smooth look sounding ect. ect. Just go get it.\n\n","February 16","true","14.6"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tgzeus/recommended/414510/","tgzeus","TheGZeus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tgzeus/","428 products in account","First off, If you don't like the graphics as you see them in the preview/screenshots, move on. This game is about gameplay first, story second, graphics third. Well, that's how I see it. ymmv.\n\nThe story is more or less a sequel to 3089, in which  The Overlord, an alien artificial intelligence used two armies of robots and you, a robot with experimental sentience to study emotion and come to dislike it. They then left the planet and their expirment behind.  The other half of the story is continued in 4089.\n\nThe flow of the game is fairly simple. An X marks the boss, which changes at certain points in the main quest. You advance your character and the game by doing quests, which you get via kiosk-like quest terminals. The main quest requires finding other specific locations, (see the preview video for a clue). You'll likely end up re-claiming bases as well, block-by-block using items gained by performing these quests. The game would be very difficult without doing this often.\n\nAt the start of the game you name your character (this is also your game's seed, so sharing a character name with a friend lets you share tips and experiences in the same world, which is cool!), and either choose a class, or start with no added points into any attributes and 12 points to spend (the latter was my choice). Character advancement is by gaining skill points directly, not by advancing levels. There is no combat exp. Enmies do drop parts, though (see below). Skill points are gained by performing quests, claiming enemy territory, or taking down the boss of an enemy tower (which is an experience I won't spoil, but is pretty dang cool). The number of points varies based on difficulty of the area in which you do the task.\n\nGear is an interesting aspect of the game. The closest comparison is Borderlands, where individual gun parts contribute to the stats of the weapon. However, here enemies only drop a single part (most usable gear can only be purchased) which you need to assemble at a workstation, and there's also 3 armour types as well as chips, hoverboards, grappling hooks, and more. Each piece of gear equipped can boost your base attributes. Choosing gear that matches your build is very important, but relying too much on gear can come back to haunt you.\n\nDeath results in a respawn. You don't lose money as you would in a Diablo-like game (Borderlands included (-: ), instead you lose an item in your inventory. This could be a heath/energy recharge item, your grappling hook, or a piece of a weapon/armour. If you're carrying only one weapon, this can be devestating until you can find a replacement part or buy a new weapon. (that's where I stand in my current game, and it's not the first time, but getting a replacement is totally do-able). Thankfully all you lose for failing a quest is your pride. It stings, but I'll live.\n\nYou can recruit quite a few followers, and the way followers work is the best I've encountered in a 3D game. If you move far enough away from them or they from you POOF they teleport to you. No fussing about trying to get a follower un-stuck from the environment or getting caught up in a pointless battle and dying. You can command an 'army ' (troop, really. I'm unsure of the number, but it's in the teens at most) of robots to fight on your behalf (if your Prestige stat is high enough), which can be very helpful. You can also build a tanky brute, a sneaky thief, or any mix of the above (though you'll have to do a bunch of quests in one location to get enough points).\n\nYou also interact with NPCs a bit during some quests (you can learn more about the world and/or fail quests depending on what you say), which is a nice addition. I'd like more of that, but phr00ts doesn't seem to have lost neither passion nor ambition for games, so here's hoping for the next game.\n\nThe game mechanics are exposed to the player, allowing you to meta-game all you like (well, you can even use it for RP. You _are_ a robot, after all).\n\nOverall, this game has replaced Daggerfall as my go-to game when I just want to run quests, explore a world I've never seen before, and do a bit of character building (though in Daggerfall I tend to always build a spellsword, and in 3089 and 5089 I tend to go for energy weapons and Prestige with some Pilot).\n\nRollertank.UFO/10\n\nPS What other game lets you recuit a robot named Edgar Rodriquez and go fight a giant boss named Christian? c'mon! That's awesome!","February 17","true","15.8"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","8","8","0","0"

She may not be the prettiest girl at the dance, but she's got the best personality and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ if she isn't a good time.\n\nThe game starts by literally throwing you into it from the sky. And there you are in this big bizarre world with nothing but your wits, some creds, and the barest of tutorials to get you going. This is one of those games that gives you just enough to allow you to play, but leaves the majourity of the mechanics for you to discover. I don't think I've said "Oh, you can do that?" this many times since E.Y.E. Divine Cybermancy.\n\nIt's also got co-op support and Vive support. To my knowledge, this is the only game right now that you can play VR in with your non-VR friends. It also easily has the most depth for any Vive game out yet, seeing as how it's a complete game that has been given full VR support. And it doesn't have one of those stupid VR premium price tags on it. If you own VR, you have to give this a shot. Even if you don't like it, it's refundable. Us Vive users don't have a lot to choose from right now. What have you got to lose?\n\nAlso, the developer (who's one guy BTW) is extremely active in the forums and cranks out patches regularly. Since I got the game a week or two ago, there's been five patches improving the VR experience, and alot of those changes have been the result of direct player feedback. He listens, and he follows through. Another big thumbs up for that.\n\nThis is one of those games that Steam Refunds was built for. It's so strange as to be offputting and a more cautious buyer might not think it worth the risk. But you can always refund it if you hate it, so what's the harm? At worst, you lose an hour or so trying something new. At best, you find a wonderful, unique experience that bizarre, charming, and a blast to play!","May 19","true","7.7"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","8","8","0","0"

There are many different play styles you can go with from a stealthy melee character to a charismatic pilot with followers in tow or just a guns blazing one robot army. If you find you're lacking in a particular skill you can always boost it by searching out weapons, armours, and chip upgrades that satisfy. There is tons of variety in weapon choice and many of the new utility weapons are awesome and really flip up your playing style (try out the decoy and teleporter!).

While simple graphically, what 5089 does well is to give the player immense freedom to play the game and advance however the player wishes.  The controlls respond well and behave in a quake-like fashion.  It is quite satisfying duking it out with the robotic enemies.  The only downside at this point in development is it takes a while to figure out what is going on.  Stick with it, though - it's well worth the time investment!\n\nThe game is being updated continuously, and specifically where I love this game is the community.  The developer is extremely responsive to community feedback, even to new players.  When I complained about the lack of NPC dialog, he promptly created a community-wide poll to get new NPC dialogs and implemented it in the next update.  Now is your chance to be a part of something special!

I have never before seen a game with such devotion put into it. This game is one of those things that you look at and go " huh 8 bucks, indie game, it looks like it could be fun" and boy is that right. This is an Action RPG that really is an Action RPG. You can play the game however you want. weather that be a sword weilding stealing stealthing ninja, or a guns blazin all up in your face dude, or a melee all up in your face dude, or a stealthy gunsman that can kill from 40 mile away, the list goes on and on. I think this may actually be one of the most fun RPG's that i have ever played. The point and quest system is amazing, and as you play the game enemy's get tougher and tougher and grow in level. The crafting is very cool, you can get different leveled parts to your gun that can add different skill points to your charecter build.\n\nLAST VERY IMPORTANT THING, READ THIS>>  Phr00t, the games developer, is honestly one of the best devs i have ever even heard of. If there is any problem you might have, he will always try his best to solve it. Back when 4089 came out i tried played it and had some problems actually starting it. I then looked at the community forum to see if there was a fix. ( keep in mind that i am on a mac which can make things a little rough) When nothing worked out from the forum Phr00t himself sent me a friend request so that we can chat personally on how to fix it, And we got it working. Now if ever i have something go wrong in the game i can always shoot him a message and i know he will respond to try to work things out with me. Also if i ever really like something i know that messaging him "hey i like that thing you put in" will be very appreciated by him. You can really tell that he cares a lot about his game, and he cares even more about the people who have play it.\n\nSO IN CONCLUSION>> Great game. Great developer who cares about the community. An actual really fun ARPG. 8 bucks. Get it.","March 29","true","7.6"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

You're looking at a campaign which lasts about 8 hours on your first run and a unique collection of gameplay features which are executed well (if rough around the edges) and can easily draw you in for many hours after.\n\nThe features I find myself drawn to again-and-again include\n- Infinite, memorable, procedural worlds. The terrain generator, while quirky, generates landscapes that are visually interesting and easy to find my way around. I can still remember large sections of the map from memory.\n- Infinite linear-effort progression. There isn't a plateau after which going after higher difficulties takes longer and longer. There is no "level cap", and each difficulty level takes about as much time to progress though as the last. This avoids any sort of level-plateau, and you can feel a sense of progression after just playing for an hour.\n- Random loot without the grind. As levels are infinite and easy to progress through, you're never forced to grind away after something which only drops 1 in 1000 times. You can, if you want to (and it's a valid playstyle), but it isn't required.\n- Adaptive gameplay. Your first few hours, you're probably going to treat this like a FPS/RPG hybrid. Once you start learning the mechanics of the game, you'll find that there are many different ways to play (all of which are possible from the start of a new game). Among the many: stealthy assassin, sniper, Just Cause-style grappler, squad leader.\n\nThe above is packed into an amusing, self-aware game. The story touches on interesting themes, but I don't feel as much of an emotional (heh) connection to it as I did to 3089.","May 17","true","11.7"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DrCarrot/recommended/414510/","DrCarrot","rxg | Apple Fabulous","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DrCarrot/","192 products in account","This is such a weird and quirky little game that I did not expect to get much out of for $6.30. I had seen it before but the RPG genre mixed with what seemed like ♥♥♥♥ poor graphics gave me the initial impression that the game may have been popular to fanboys of the series but wasn't seriously worth looking at. Judging a book by it's cover, yada yada, I was very very wrong.\n\n5089 is a procedural borderlands-like RPG where you traverse a very colorful landscape to do some story or other, I haven't really looked at it yet, but from what I gather it's pretty interesting. Throughout your travels you find different parts for different weapons and utilities (a weapon consists of parts, from two up to five or six) that affect different aspects of your weapon, like projectile speed, damage, type of bullet, and various other unique modifiers like leech and reflectivity.\n\nThe way skills work ties nicely into how the world generates and what you can expect from that batch. First off, there are enemy and friendly open-roof bases that spawn the respective NPC's and can get quite large. Your job is to convert all of the enemy bases into your own "faction"'s base all the while getting better armor, weapons, and utilities. At these bases are things like weapon, armor, computer chip (more stats), quest, consumable, utilities, etc. vendors that ramp up at each base you go to. The difficulty of the map increases as you go further away from your home base at the center of this large ever expanding circle. As you go away from the center, you get more skill points from quests, more money, better parts, higher leveled guns and enemies, and other things of that nature.\n\nSkills are handled very well and I wish they were handled like they are here in other games. With every quest you complete (which are randomly generated but ultimately share the same 3-5 picks of ~15 unique goals) you get money and skill points, and you get a generous serving of them, which makes completing quests and getting 70 points to spend really saitisfying. There are about 12 different food groups of skills, including stealth, piloting (there are fighter jets), gun & melee, and programming (for getting better stats on chips). You assign these bodacious skill points into these groups and get better results in different things, like being able to fly new planes or being able to recruit better NPC followers.\n\nControl feels very nice, I personally enjoy it a lot. The gravity feels slightly less than that of the moon (assuming your carrying capacity isn't over, in which case you just go slower) but you still have a lot of control over your character. Sprinting doesn't use your energy bar so it's something you use all the time to fling yourself around in the air. Flying controls are great too, and at all times I feel like I'm in control of my situation.\n\nI got a lot more out of this game than I originally thought I would and after 16 hours I'm not disappointed nor done. The developer responds to all inquiries immediately (literally like 30 minutes) and with a semi small playerbase and single developer, he reads all suggestions and requests and responds to all of them. The game is constantly updated even after all this time and the dev really shows great professionalism when dealing with everything. It's actually kind of incredible.","May 9","true","25.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

You play as the only Robot who cannot be self-destructed by a push of a button, making you the last hope of robotkind. The game features a ROBUST upgrade system with so many different types of weapon, armor, chips modification and utility upgrades. The loot system is akin to the Diablo series, but not as in depth. The quests you go on net you stat points, ditching a conventional leveling system for quest by quest stat allocation which works very well. When I first played it's predecessor 3089, I was first upset about the fact there was no leveling system, but was happy when I saw it was a stat point allocation system from questing, which I immediately fell in love with. That effectively makes a GRIND for leveling almost Non-existent.\n\nThe game has an open world where you take down Team purple. You fight bosses, regular ol' robots, spider like robots etc etc, all with human names, like Jack, Lauren etc etc. It's pretty funny, actually. You also convert enemy bases into your own, which makes you feel all powerful and that you actually restored a bit of peace to the world of XAX.\n\nI HIGHLY recommend this game. Phr00t is a great indie developer and he deserves the attention.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mechanos/recommended/414510/","Mechanos","Mechanos -CD-","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mechanos/","221 products in account","Hmm..  where do I start?  This is a game that feels like it has a little bit of every genre, packed into an open world FPSRPG shell.  If you are a fan of the previous games, such as 3079..  you will see some welcome resemblance here.  Not to say this is a 3079 clone though.  This game differs in a lot of ways and includes a lot of unique features.  Some of these features include:\n\n- Item Customizing.  All weapons and armor are pieced together from 2-4 modules, each with unique stats and functionality, for you to mix and match.\n\n- RPG style character attributes, leveled up through completing missions rather than traditional experience collecting.\n\n- Multiple ways to accomplish a goal or play.  Want to be stealthy?  Level your stealth attribute.  Want to do massive damage?  Put points into Guns or Melee.  Want to attack your enemies in a small fighter ship instead?  Pilot skill has you covered, and via a recent update, said pilot skill will even make your ship more effective the more points you have invested in it.\n\n- A plethora of optional tools, not limited to hoverboards, grapple hooks, teleport guns, gravity well generators, and others.  These tools can be used to help you get around faster, overcome tough areas, or just give you something fun to mess around with.\n\n- NPC Recruiting.  Need some backup?  Want to see if you can clear out an entire building without having to fire a shot yourself?  There's an attribute that will allow you to recruit any allies you come across, assuming you have enough points invested in it.\n\n- Base capturing.  You can literally invade enemy areas, clear them out, then use special items to convert the square you're in to your team permanently.  This in turn can unlock and power higher level gear selling stations, and cause allied NPCs to start spawning in the area.\n\n- Functioning Multiplayer.  And as a bonus, to my knowledge, Singleplayer plays exactly like Multiplayer and there are no game mechanics that will penalize you for only playing one or the other.\n\n- A developer that listens to the community, and at the time of this being posted, is actively releasing updates with balance tweaks and/or new features.  While this may technically not be an in-game feature, this is definitely a good feature none the less!\n\nI'm probably forgetting to mention some things, like the fact that there's a boss available to fight nearly right away (although I don't recommend trying to fight him right away lol), or that you can build various little structures like turrets or temporary ships, using a matter powered build gun.  But I'll leave some of the game for you to find out yourself.\n\nNow, I could make a list of cons like I usually would.  But I can't really think of many at this time.  For completion sake, the game obviously doesn't have AAA title level of graphics, and sometimes the terrain and structures can be a bit wonky.  The random item loss on death can be a bit irritating too, especially if you get too comfortable with a certain play style or certain level of attributes, then come across an enemy that surprises you with high damage.  That said, the graphics and terrain don't detract from the overall experience.  And the death penalties can be avoided through new play strategies and/or increasing your attributes.\n\nOverall, I tend to be very stingy in my game reviews.  If I find enough cons in a game to make it not feel worth the price, I will be honest and not recommend the game.  That is not the case with this game though, as every complaint I've ever had or mentioned on the forums, ended up being met with discussion and even being addressed by phr00t himself.  If you're a fan of FPSRPG games and want to mix things up a bit, or if you're a fan of games with tons and tons of randomized loot, I feel you will definitely get your $7.99 (current listed price) worth out of it.","March 11","true","12.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I can't guess how many hours I have been playing, I lost the track of time since Phr00t (Developer) gifted me with a 5089 key for free in a giveaway. He is an amazing developer but you must know this by know. 5089 is pretty much like his other games, they are all very creative. It may be a little hard at first, if you are new to the series I encourage you to try his previous games before this one.\n\n[Graphics] 5089 has the most peculiar graphics, they are simple but very creative in their own way. The color and the design are very pleasant to the eye when you are playing and that helps a lot If you wanna waste some hours like myself.\n[Music]The music is good and fit perfectly in the game (as everybody here has stated).\n[Story] I haven't gotten so far like I would like to; to talk about the story of 5089, but I can say that sometimes in a mission you get pieces of information that explain things to you, or they make some interesting references to Phr00t's previous games "3089, 4089".\n[Mechanics] Mechanics are one of the strongest reasons on how you react to a game and you can bet this games has some nice mechanics. You have the Stats board, with that (and Skill Points) you can increase any physical mechanics like speed, damage and many more.. That and many aspects stills remains the same to his previous games, but improved at the same time.\n\nThis game has recently released, it is not weird if you encounter some bugs or any similar inconvenient but the developer cares a lot about the game and he is making updates often fixing all sort of bugs. He may add some cool features but know he is focusing in stability, which is perfect..\n\nI would like to make this review with more depth but English is not my mother-language. To everyone who has played previous Phr00t's games you must know by know that this review applies to every previous game he had made. They are all pretty creative, interesting and cleverly made.. (I can't talk for "3079" or "Spermination" because I don't own them).\n\nTl;tr: Every aspect of this game is genuinely creative and the developer succeeded to put it all together....

You can do quests, or you can choose to simply engage in one of the many battles perpetually happening around you. You can travel great distances into enemy territory, stealthily infiltrate their bases, loot their gear, and assassinate their bosses, OR you can grab a ship, blow their fighters and other flyers out of the sky, and collect loot that way. OR you can take peaceful missions that involve distributing sensitive items among other characters in hostile territory.\n\n...OR, you can simply spend your time running, jumping, flying, and hovering around the map for fun. That brings me to my single favorite thing about this game: the MASSIVE array of ways you can navigate the map. You can obviously walk - and if you're not over-encumbered, you can run and jump like a velociraptor. But eventually you'll get gear that allows you to latch on to various surfaces (including enemy flyers), hover over terrain, fly, teleport, and do virtually any combination of the above in rapid succession. The sheer responsiveness of the controls in this game makes all of the above easy to accomplish. Some of the weapons / upgrades you can get are pretty crazy - for example, you can shoot a teleporting beacon that rolls like a soccer ball, then right click at any point to be immediately teleported to the beacon's location, while maintaining your present momentum and facing. You can even fire it far up into the air and access the tops of buildings, trees, etc. Or, you can use a hoverboard to sail all over the place. This game is set on a planet with gravity somewhere between that of the earth and the moon (which makes bounding over things quite fun, especially during combat).\n\nIn addition to the joy of simply navigating the planet, you get to modify various skills - you can turn invisible, for instance, and use melee combat (be a "Ninja"), steal items, or just run and gun down everything in sight. There is a fairly simple crafting system, but the items you are able to acquire and the abilities they give you are VAST in number and in scope, and by virtue of all of these options, choosing and creating gear can be a quite complicated affair, especially given your limited space for inventory.\n\nIt took me few couple sessions to realize it, but the world of Xax constantly evolves around you and changes based on your accomplishments. Likewise, a lot of things happen around you without your initiating them - meaning that, although you may create a fairly peaceful character, taking espionage-type missions and focusing on stealth and maneuverability, the enemy (in all their purple glory) may simply start violently invading your base one morning. They'll swarm your territory without warning, dropping off soldiers and "ants" - freaky daddy-longleg-like balls with spidery legs that crawl extremely fast. They'll start trying to mow you and your comrades down from the air and on foot, and this can happen quite without warning. Should you survive, you can return the favor by gathering a host of allies and raiding their nearby bases in turn - likewise from the air and / or on foot. These battles happen all over the map, whether you're there to participate in them or not, and this realistic dynamic makes every venture beyond the walls of your base interesting and rewarding.\n\nI know I've barely touched on things like customization, weapons, advancing your character, role-playing, enemy-types, etc., but the above are just a few of aspects of this game I've really enjoyed, given my limited amount of time playing so far. I'm sure I'll be pouring quite a few hours into this game in the months ahead, and I whole-heartedly recommend it to anyone who enjoys exploring interesting and dynamic science fiction worlds.","March 14","true","10.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I've been playing with phr00t's software since I saw 3079 and was just interested in the entire world, I was amazed with wonder and curiousity to whatever lies out beyond the horizons and hills.\n-Procedural worlds, mixed lands, interesting caverns, bases and encounters.\n-An absurd array of crafting parts ranging from weapons, armor, and chips to make the best gear possible.\n-RPG Classes and attributes such as, programming, stealth, firearms, melee, piloting, persuasive skills, etc.\n-Mixed VR settings for Sitting, Roomscale, and Mixed. [I personally play Mixed as I do not get motion sickness, and I love the ability to use my roomscale as advantage in-game.]\n-Great story plot\n-Much to explore\n-Lots of dying\n-Why you should try 5089 [and or other previous projects]? Because these games are very unique, they feel and sound very classic and oldschool, with a modern bump.\nThe developer Phr00t works very hard on his games, he even reaches out to users so he can get feedback to ensure the development of his games get better. I'm not sure if Phr00t is independant or has a small team, but I can assure you there are many updates to guarantee your gaming experience [usually at least one update everyday until something is optimal or working correctly.]\nPhr00t's Software strives on user feedback so give this dev some feedback, because whether it be, positive, or negative, it will help shape the future of Phr00t's Softwares into something better.\n\nDo I recommend 5089? Yes, it's an experience most should play, and eventually, try to beat it. ;)","May 25","true","5.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I did not expect that and it proves me the dedication he has for his game. He worked directly on the things I pointed out and most of the issues have been resolved.\n\ngameplay:\nIt is your mission to save the world of xax by killing the purple robots, conquer their bases and destroy their towers. You fight enemies with melee weapons, guns or in aircrafts. Melee still feels unresponsive and aircrafts have weird controls, so the for me guns worked out best. Energy launchers are worth special mention, because they have really good accuracy and also an AoE-damage which makes hitting enemies easier. You want to have a secondary weapon against aircrafts though. A really cool idea is the collection of weapon and armor parts, which have different traits and the combination of them makes them usable. If you find one better part for your weapon, you can take one part from it away and replace it with the new one. This works really works\n\nworld:\nThe world is generated randomly, which can still cause frustration sometimes. Big mountains or Gaps are not really a problem anymore, because you now get access to a grappling hook from the beginning. But there were still some issues for me, that no purple bases spawned nearby.\nFor me the most fun part of the game is to take a purple tower with all its enemies down. At the top of the building is a boss waiting and if you kill him, the building will collapse.\n\n\ngraphics:\nI dont want to bash the graphics, you can see them clearly in the pictures and you can like it or not. It reminded me a bit of Descend, it has its charms.\n\nmusic:\nThe music is like in Unreal Tournament and suits the game well. I especially like the music in the title sceen, it makes it really epic.\nUnfortunately it gets repetetive fast and switches abrupt if entering battle or starting a quest.\n\nconclusion:\nI like the game and im excited about all updates in the future!","February 4","true","10.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","6"

It appears crude, perhaps even lazy, but after immersing myself in the game I'm happy to say that the opposite is true.\n\nWhile the game's styling is unusual it certainly intentional, and it lends a trippy quality to the game that makes it a blast to play! It feels reminiscent of a lot of 80's Sci-Fi movies: great setting, righteous weapons, made up lingo that immerses you in the world, and enough action to keep things exciting.\n\nThe world of Xax is mired in a war that has gone on for 2000 years, and the map really shows it. Each world is procedurely generated, in other games this is a red flag for me, procedural generation brings to mind too many horrible geomotries and impassible obstacles, However in 5089 its done very well. Every level is full of structure and detail, as well as some really interesting geography that will impact the gameplay experience.\n\nI haven't played long, but I'm eager to get back into it!

I got it quite some time ago, and enjoyed it quite a bit. A simple, fun, challenging game that's also great with friends. 5089 is a sequel, and it really does improve upon 3089. Updated visuals, some new gameplay features, and some more. I added phr00t some time ago, and found that he was a great help whenever I encountered a bug or problem with the game, and he appears to be actively working on fixing problems that even a few users have. The only major issue I've come across is multiplayer not working so great, but the problem is hard to pinpoint, and the game is more than enough fun solo. Though, a major problem for new players would be getting a grip on the game itself. It is by no means an easy to pick up game, but after learning the basics, you're more than ready to take on the world, after leveling up quite a bit. :P I know I had to do the same when I started with 3089.\n\nMay 5089 continue to get better as the updates come along, and I hope I get more hours in it too.

It's a game where you can spend a ton of time and hardly scratch the surface.\n\nEven as an experienced gamer, this title was intimidating to jump into. My girlfriend has been playing all my vive games with me and I'm skeptical that someone who hasn't played open rpg games would be able to grasp what to do without guidance. The game references online guides and videos from the title screen for people that need a hand. If you use a bit of game knowledge, you can figure out what the various vendor/quest stations do pretty easily.\n\nPros :\n-Zero VR sickness\n-In spite of the basic graphics, rather immersive.\n-Strong RPG elements\n-More content than I can currently wrap my head around.\n-Huge value for your money. Tons of game here for such a low price.\n-Custom class! (Yippie) As well as premade classes.\n-Phr00t, the game's creator is informative, open and communacative with the community.\n-The controls are displayed on the Vive controllers for WHEN you forget.\n-Multiple Vive configurations. Room-scale, standing, sitting.\n-Ranged weapons fire nicely and aim properly with the Vive handset.\n-Environment is mysterious and exciting to explore.\n\nCons :\n-Intimidating to start out. I suggest just going for it and getting used to the movement, then grabbing a quest inside a building.\n-The top-down drop-in at the start of the game was somewhat confusing.\n-I find melee weapons difficult to use unless you have movement down. The most recent patch with the quick-teleporter properly functioning seems to have solved this.\n\nIn summary, this is a game where I know I'll be spending a large portion of my Vive time. I'm happy I purchased it and I think it's awesome that Phr00t added vive support. It really helps expand the community and the product.","May 10","true","2.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RiderofDark/recommended/414510/","RiderofDark","Rider of Dark","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RiderofDark/","725 products in account","5089 is an open world game, and as far as I can tell is effectively infinite. Regions are measured in levels and there's always a higher-level area to rush into. Beyond that, the player is free to take any avenue they want to get the job done.\n\nI'm a run'n'gun player. Get the long-range energy launcher, a low-velocity high-damage weapon, and have at the enemy. I spend a lot of my time running about and shooting. Or, just as often, I'm slipping across the landscape in a hoverboard, Floating on the surface and cruising at whichever direction I set. Only aircraft are able to keep up with me while I'm using the hoverboard, which is important when it's time to turn tail. An important fundamental in the face of some dangerously explosive enemies.\n\nAs well as the energy launcher, there are a number of other tools and weapons available to the player to get things done. There are energy pistols and energy rifles, which are respectively short- and medium-range weapons. Both are able to charge rounds, which gives the player the ability to deal a hefty alpha strike.\n\nEnergy weapons are dependent on the player's energy. Which is used to power utility items as well as energy weapons.\n\nThe hoverboard is unique in the game. It is the only utility item in the game that does not consume energy. It is also unique in being able to be used simultaneously with other items and weapons. This is fantastic, allowing the board to become a second facet of mobility. This is furthered with two of the other utility items. The grappling hook and the telelocator. The grappling hook is what it is. Target a location, fire. If the target is close enough, the hook grabs on and pulls the player. The second is the telelocator. Fire off a ball, which rolls off into the distance. At the players command, the player teleports to where the ball was. And in either case, the hoverboard can be active while swinging about with the hook or popping about with the telelocator. Utility items only consume energy on activation, not on sustained use.\n\nThere are a number of other utility items. The decoy, which in application is very similar to the telelocator. Instead of teleporting the player to the ball's location, a doppleganger is instead created to pull the attention of enemies. The GraviGun. Hold and fire crates, whether to defend from a hit or two, or fling those explosive crates at others. And then the Gravity Hole. Suck in the standard size robots and crates for one fine grouping. Using those in tandem yields some great results.\n\nThere are weapons that don't consume energy. Instead they consume ammunition, an item the player carries about. Once again launchers are slow-projectile high-damage weapons. Either packs quite the punch. However. there are three other weapons in this category. The pistol and the rifle. These two items offer something different: silencers and scopes. They give players the ability to snipe others with ease. They also are prime for taking advantage of a stealth attack bonus. The last of the ammunition-dependent weapons is the uzi. A weapon with low accuracy making up for it with the fastest firing speed in the game, as well as the only instance of automatic fire. Great for dealing with large crowds.\n\nAnd then there's melee, something that I'm only beginning to play around with. There is the sword, essentially a long sword, and a dagger. Slow and high damage, or quick and low. Charging the weapon gives the player the ability to lock onto a target and then, fully charged, make a leaping attack. This attack will trigger regardless of enemy, flying or grounded--the leap attack is viable as long as that enemy is in range.\n\nAnd then, to top it all off, there are the stats. Health--in the game measured as stamina--defense, guns, melee, and a slew of other support skills. They all have an impact, and just as the exploration is (probably) infinite, so too is stat building. I've spent countless hours running quests to buff stats to the point where I was a demigod. Able to be taken down by my own foolhardiness, but overall able to take everything and dish it back. I don't know where the stat cap might be, but I know for certain that it is quite possible to have any given stat number in the tens of thousands.\n\nImproving stats is quite simple, and quite fast. Quests reward stat points, which are used to increase whichever stat the player desires. Quests are fast, simple, and aside from the story-specific ones, infinite. While they do spread the standard gamut--escort, protect, kill, fetch--there are also some dedicated to stealth. Best of all, each quest set takes less than five minutes to complete.\n\nEnough quick action to entertain for short quick bursts, and enough diversity to keep entertaining for hours. And the game saves automatically; quitting at any time is totally viable.\n\nThe only thing I don't like about the game is conversion points. The world is powered down, and requires the player to convert bases, take down boss towers, and the occasional neutral surveyor in order to unlock access to stores in higher-level areas. This has not stopped me from spending way too much time (e.g. not enough) running around and causing havoc on the planet's surface.","May 29","true","131.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I'll explain below, but the shortest description I could give this rather odd duck would be a "roleplaying shooter with procedurally generated loot and terrain and awesomely terrible graphics."\n\nI should warn pickier players (myself included) that projectiles are not "hitscan" bullets with instant travel time, and some weapons have slower projectiles than others.  You will have to tweak the parts of your weapons to ultimately get more or less what you want for a given weapon type.\n\nIts mechanic of expanding your power and influence via overcoming boss challenges and enemy base invasions reminds me of AVWW, as well as the sort of retro-and-ugly graphical style and chiptune-like music.  If you didn't know, A Valley Without Wind (first game, not second) is a VERY eccentric Metroidvania style game by Arcen Games.\n\nIt has some limited (but useful and sometimes necessary) stealth mechanics, including suppressors for some weapon types, which combined with the system for stripping parts from found weapons and armor, reminds me somewhat of Fallout 4.\n\nIt has quirky (and often sort of difficult to use) stats and modifications on various weapon types, whose stats are procedurally generated, which is where I sort of get a Borderlands vibe.\n\nI'm about 9 hours in currently, and have only just now really managed to start making some serious headway in acquiring some new territory and expanding my influence.  Worlds are randomly generated, so YMMV, but I think it took about 6 hours to really feel like I knew what I was trying to accomplish, with some general grinding, exploring, and probing taking place before that.\n\nI like it.  It's strange, and different, and bizarre, and at times infuriating.  Try it!","February 19","true","18.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

(Atleast to me it is.)\n\nMy Story : (Doesn't add to review, you can skip this part)\n\nA couple ago I found a game called "3079",  and was still into minecraft. I watched it on 2 channels,  which I had to look deep in my youtube subscriber feed, Paulsoaresjr and the Yogscast channel. The game looked fun and from what I understood it was about doing quests and getting a demon slaying sword to kill demon leaders, I got older and was out of minecraft and this game faded into the abyss of my memory. A couple days ago I was looking through steam for semi-cheap games and found this, the name sounded familiar but nothing clicked, then I realized. "This is that game from years ago." so I purchased it, sat down with a couple of snacks and soda and watched some videos of 3079 while this game downloaded, and from as much as I played so far this game is fun.\n\nGameplay : Difficult to pick up at first, but if your learning on your own, spend your first 30-45 minutes getting used to the game and begin a new save. If you still don't have a clue there aren't many guides but you should check them out.\n\nOverall, hate it or not, its not a bad game. Everyone should experience this atleast once.","March 29","true","13.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Deep RPG system, basic story, but quests forever.\n\nNow, the VR review.\n\nHoly **** - I get sick.

When you jump into this game you get to experiance this long lasting battle against Violet and Orange forces, Which creats a good atmosphere in the game. I should also state that you can play differently every new character which makes it have a good replay factor, Play as a officer commanding giant armys, or just be a lone wolf destroying bases and paving a way for you friendly troops. I mostly play as a commander having a giant army and I LOVE it, but play anyway you want. So putting this all in consideration the only semi bad thing in this game is the graphics which i dont really care that much about and sometimes the terrain can be a little hard to move around in but it is a hostile planet. WHAT SHOULD YOU EXPECT? So overall I will give it a 10/10 WILL PLAY AGAIN, Thankyou for this game, and the developer is super nice.

He said "Many people wanted something more like 3089, and better than 3089", so his response was to remake 3089, almost the exact same way, with a few new assets?\nWhy the hell would you not just make a new game, that's both better and fresh?\nYou could retain ALL of the core gameplay, just change it for ♥♥♥♥s sake.\nBlatantly using planet Xax because you were to lazy to fabricate something different (3079 - 3089; do that again).\n\nSame exact gun models cut out a side view in Blender with random 80's track suit colors (You know, red, green, yellow, purple). Same exact robot models with very few additions (no, resizing and skewing current models doesn't make them different). Same hellish, randomly generated landscape with points everywhere.\n♥♥♥♥ man, I even got quests that I saw in 3089 (Oh, and quest system is exactly the same).\n\nThe only "changes" were:\n-Conversions, which is cool I guess\n-Slightly less underbalanced weapons, but still crap (especially if you hate walking all over creation to different weapon vendors for one slightly less useless weapon)\n-Different colors for the enemies (Yellow and Purple totally isn't Red and Blue!)\n-Building textures don't consist of stretch carpet photos from google, look cracked (and pretty good)\n-Destroyed looking buildings\n-One new noticable building type with random enemies filling it.\n-Co-op\n\nWhen the dev said higher quality, more polished assets, I didn't think expect a TON, but look at the pictures! It's the same textures with DIRT added on them to look higher quality! He couldn't even bother making better looking models!\n\nAgain, I was only expecting what people told me, a better 3089, and that's true, if you don't already own 3089.\nThey feel almost like the exact same game, with 3089 missing a few things, that aren't landmark changes, and one could live without easily.\n----------------------------------------------------------\nTo Dev:\n\nSeriously? Lower quality models and textures than 4089!?\nAre you kidding me?\nYou took a step back!?\n\nPhr00t, I realise making a lot of games in a quick amount of time can net you some OK profit, but christ, sit down and spend a LOT of time on 5079, 6089, 6079, or whatever you are making next, and try to make it blow people's mind like you did with 3079.\n\nI can only play x0x9 clones for so long before they feel like you aren't trying to make something many will enjoy at all (like that ♥♥♥♥ing spermination game; just Youtube fodder). It feels more like those indie devs that make random little games that deserve to be $1 because it's 5 minutes long. Bad comparison, but same concept. "Making as many games as you can so if at least 100 people buy each game and you make 100 5 minute games that's $10,000."\n\nIt isn't hard to take a pre-made engine and make a game like this (especially with the experience you have with jMonkey), so why the hell would you not try to put much more into it?\n\nI felt that way with 4089 too, but at least everything on it was FRESH, and new.\n\nWith this, I just feel let down.\nI wanted to like it, but after the little bit I played, it soured, and reminded me that I liked 3089 initially too, and that it felt exactly the same.","March 8","false","1.4"," 15 of 40 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","15","40","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lowtaxico/recommended/414510/","lowtaxico","Lowtax","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lowtaxico/","138 products in account","This game is called 5089 because it's the 5089th entry in this guy's series of games.  There are many reasons to buy and play this game:\n\n1) You hate yourself\n2) You like procedurally generated wads of technicolor vomit\n3) You have a fetish for unreadable fonts\n4) You REALLY hate yourself\n\nEverything is randomly generated and never looks the same, much in the same way as your bowel movements.  There are tons of numbers and stats for all the autistic people out there who love looking at numbers and counting ceiling tiles.  You can buy pants from a vending machine, but sometimes they only have one leg and then you have to buy the other pants leg and assemble them at an engineering workbench because this is the future and there are no sweatshops to do this in the future.  Everything in the game is dumb and makes no sense and is generally an abomination of shapes and colors that should never exist, and gameplay that is somehow neither a game nor play.  If somebody gifts you this game, unfriend them and report them to Steam for crimes against humanity.\n\nPROS: it's really easy to not buy this game\nCONS: game proves there is no god","March 29","false","1.7"," 23 of 66 people (35%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","35","23","66","20","12"
