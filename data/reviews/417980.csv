Diving through these planets will be dangerous and you’ll find many obstacles in your way but fear not, for you have Buddy with you! Buddy is your robotic companion of amusement and will be of use to you on your perilous adventure.\n\nPresentation\nPlanet Diver’s graphical style is quite hard to describe, it’s almost as if it’s being displayed on a relatively old analogue TV, well not really but you get the idea. Anyway, this graphical style not only fits the game well but also looks damn good! While fairly simple, all of the models in game look great, particularly some of the more colourful enemies you’ll face.\n\nGameplay\nTaking place on three planets each with three different biomes, Planet Diver’s 75 missions is reasonably varied and with an endless arcade mode too there’s a good amount of bang for your buck. The core mechanics of the game are incredibly simple. The levels have different lanes your character can travel in. As well as having the ability to move left or right into a new lane you can also speed up or slow down (the speeds and number of speed levels vary depending on what Buddy mods you have but the default is three different levels of speed). Speeding up (boosting) just before hitting an enemy will allow you to fly through them, i.e. kill them. Slowing down (braking) is used as a way to dodge as well as a way to recharge your boosts (default number of charges is three).\n\nOkay so it’s not quite that simple. For a start you have two health bars, meaning you can take three hits before it’s game over. A health bar is depleted whenever you hit or get hit by something without dodging or boosting. For example if you fly straight into one of the many unfriendly creatures found in the game you’ll lose one health bar. But fear not! Health bars can be recharged by killing creatures or by collecting star stuff. Star stuff is a resource found throughout the game, the amount found depends on your speed and how far into the level you are, the more you collect the more your health bar is recharged. Star stuff is also the game’s currency and can be used to purchase new skins, Buddy mods and soundtracks. As well as all of this the tunnel you fly through isn’t smooth with nothing in it, there are often obstacles in the level which you’ll need to dodge if you want to survive.\n\nBack to those pesky creatures I mentioned earlier. There are some. You’ll find them throughout each level and more often than not they’ll do their damn best to make your life a misery. What they do, of course, varies with each critter. Some of them will follow you and then dive bomb into you while others will sit on the wall of the level and shoot webs that slow you down at you. As well as these, you’ll find yourself in boss fights at certain points in the game. The bosses are damn well challenging I’ll tell you that, even the best Planet Divers will struggle a little here.\n\nThe last thing worth mentioning about the gameplay is the fact that each level has a challenge you have to complete in order to progress with each challenge having three levels: bronze (the minimum needed to unlock the next level), silver and gold. Generally these are relatively easy to do without going too far out of your way in any given level though some of them are rather challenging. While I did like these challenges I did feel as though some of them were a little too harsh considering the fact you can’t progress without completing them. For example the first boss fight’s challenge is to only get hit three times for bronze, something that’s incredibly hard to achieve. Now you can of course avoid the challenges thanks to something I’ll mention in the next section but I didn’t want to take the easy way out and I imagine most people won’t.\n\nMiscellaneous While there’s not much of a story in the game there is dialogue between Buddy and the diver before the start of each level and it’s often rather amusing.\nStore prices felt a little steep to me, I wasn’t able to purchase my first item until about two thirds of the way through the first planet.\nThe soundtrack fits nicely with the game but does get a little repetitive after a few hours of gameplay.\nThis should be obvious but the game relies pretty heavily on your reaction times so if you’re particular slow when it comes to reacting to games you might not have the best time while playing.\nIf you fail a level a fair few times in a row you’ll be given the option to do a super easy run. You won’t be able to keep any of the star stuff you collect but you’ll be able to complete the mission.\nThe price of Planet Diver is considerably less than I expected when I was playing and reviewing the game, at this price I really can’t see any reason for you not to buy it.\nWant to know what the game looks like in action? Check out this short gameplay video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYZr-_krv-0\n\nVerdict\nWorth Purchasing.\n\nPlanet Diver is a fun and often challenging action game where you’ll plunge through narrow levels using your wing suit. The graphics are nice and the gameplay is relatively simple but very entertaining.\n\nReview Copy Provided.\n\nNo drama, Just Reviews.\n\nEl K.","December 1, 2015","true","5.4"," 56 of 65 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","56","65","0","5"

All my developer sponsored reviews are positive because I review games that I like!═══════════════════════════════════OVERVIEW\none look at the screenshots tells you what this game is about, but under that simplicity there is complexity to it.\nthe premis is that diver wants to dive through each planet just for fun, this leads to a carefree atmosphere to the game, and some funny dialog exchanges between the diver and buddy.\ngameplay wise it is a top-down scroller, but with several factores affecting it it becomes more by opening up ways for different play styles; unlockables and varied enemy types will allow you freedom of play where speed is not the only solution to every situation, nor is it the best.\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/417980\n═══════════════════════════════════PROS & CONS\nPros: art style:  pixel art, but seems like a filter aplied to it to make it look like its being played on an old TV.\nsound design: music choices and how it sounds lends to the old TV feel the game is going for, and the game sound effects are clear, and distinct, to allow you to rely on them for sound cues.\nunlockables.\nreferences to other works of entertainment.\nconsiderable amount of levels to keep you coming back.\nlikeable characters.\nenemy variety.\nsimple controls: you can play with either hand alone without inconvenience.\narcad mode for competitive play.\naddicting gameplay.\nCons: limited choice of unlockable music: its a con because after a while, the music you hear all the time starts to get irretating.\nmovment: moving left or right doesnt feel natural or smooth, its more like etching lane by lane, which is good for precise movment, but breaks the flow of the movement.\nkey bindings: because some actions have more than one key bound to it, and some keys more than one action bound to it. this causes some inconvenience, but also provides alternatives to those kind of problems.\nminor glitches from time to time.═══════════════════════════════════SUMMARY & FINAL RATING\nScore: 8/10\n\nfun, addicting, and plenty of content for its price.  this is an excellent time waster with not a dull moment.\n\n═══════════════════════════════════For more recommendations by LL's Game Giveaways and Reviews on quality indie games or ones with high potential follow our group curtations here!","December 8, 2015","true","4.7"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","17","21","0","0"

This does not affect my review, these are my honest opinions.~~\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=606446059\nTags: Indie, Action, Arcade, Pixel Graphics, Sci-fi, Fast-Paced, Funny, Female Protagonist.\nPoints of interestColorful, appealing retro graphics that look like they are displayed on an analogue tv screen\nStarstuff is the currency, which you earn by collecting in stages or completing certain goals in story mode. You can use it to buy the unlocks.\nFast-paced gameplay that demands fast reflexes\nStory mode (where you have to complete certain objectives each dive) and arcade mode (to brag about your highscore in kills, distance, and starstuff, which is the currency)\nIn story mode, there are three levels of objectives you can complete: Bronze, Silver, and Gold. The harder challenges award more starstuff, but only bronze is required to pass a level.\nSeveral different maps to play on and dozens of upgrades to enhance your gameplay, both cosmetically and mechanically. You can unlock new areas to explore, new mods for your robot buddy, alternate appearance for your suit, and new soundtracks.\n2 important things that you will have to manage: health and energy. You can take 3 hits before dying on a full heath bar and you can replenish your health by collecting starstuff. Your energy bar is depleted when you use the down arrow key to boost and is refilled when you use the up arrow to slowdown.\nWell-designed UI\nAffordable price tag ($3.99).\nHard to play for long sessions of time. In my opinion, it is best played in short, 10-20 minute periods.\nUpgrades have an unreasonable price which discouraged me from buying some of them. Then again, they can keep you coming back for more.\nDifficult to control moving from left to right. The arrow keys need to be tapped multiple times to move from side to side.  I think it would feel more fluid if you had the option to hold down the left and right buttons instead of tap them several times. You also use up and down arrows to perform your special abilities. By default, up is used to brake and gives you brief invulnerability. Down, on the other hand, sends you rocketing forward at high speeds, smashing through any obstacles and enemies along your way for a few seconds. The up and down arrow keys feel ok, it’s just the right and left keys that are awkward.Summary:Planet Diver is a fast-paced, Sci-fi arcade game. It has 2 different game modes, colorful graphics, reflex demanding gameplay, and several different maps. Suffers from some control issues, but other than that, I highly recommend you check this game out($3.99 is an excellent price)!\n\nMy implemented rating system:Run away! 1-2/10\nHandle with caution… 3-4/10\nBuy on sale: 5-6/10\nEvery day purchase: 7-8/10\nMust buy: 9-10/10\n\nThis game’s rating: 8/10.

So you grab your A.I. companion drone, wing suit and rocket boots and get ready to jump!\n\nPlanet diver is a different take on the minimalist "runner" style of games. You're on a non-stop collision course with the finish line (unless you're in a survival mode where you just keep falling), your weapon is either your limited dash or your companion (depending on upgrades), and your job is to avoid or destroy obstacles in your path while gathering "starstuff" to buy new upgrades/costumes/music.\n\nControlsControls are very simple: left and right or A and D to move left and right along your track, down or S to perform a dash attack and increase your speed, and W or up to perform a dual purpose "evade-brake" that both evades obstacles and drops your speed to the lowest rate.\n\nGameplayEach fall (run) takes place in a semi-randomly generated pit divided into invisible lanes, littered with a variety of enemies, obstacles, and starstuff. Enemies and mobile obstacles, such as boulders, can be evaded or destroyed, while immobile obstacles, such as protruting walls, separated walls and flame geysers, must be avoided entirely. falling through starstuff collects it to be used at the shop between falls, with your current speed acting as a collection modifier: the faster you are, the more you get per collection.\n\nThe character has two gauges: Health and Dash. Depending on upgrades, the character han have 1-3 health and 1-4 dashes. Striking any obstacles take away one health, which is restored by collecting starstuff or destroying enemies; striking an obstacle while at less than one helth ends the run. Each time a dash it performed, one point of the dash gauge is consumed; dashes regenerate over time and by evade-braking.\n\nBeyond regular gameplay, there are also per-level missions, a speed run timer, and planetary bosses. Level missions are objectives attached to each level, such as "kill X bats" or "keep an average speed rating of X", that award starstuff and rating stars upon completion. The speed run gauge tracks how quickly you complete a fall and is purely competitive. At the end of each planet is a boss with its own mechanics to beat; defeat each boss to unlock the next planet and ultimately complete story mode.\n\nOverallWhile I have some personal qualms over the dialogue character design, overall the game is fun. I highly recommend this game to any reflex gamer or anybody loooking for a "coffee break" game, and hope to see great things in the future If this is the expected quality of this developer,","March 16","true","4.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

When you get through each planet you unlock the next one not only in the story but also in the arcade mode which acts as your infinite level generator.\n\nPlanet Diver has been released on Steam and  IOS/Andriod whilst this is often a black mark against a game in this case it doesn't seem to have made much of a difference other than the relatively simple controls. The steam version has the micro transactions removed and whilst I haven't tried the mobile version reviews seem to be positive.\n\nWhilst the infinite runner style game can get very dull very fast planet diver has plenty of features to give you good value for your money.  With all of the different mods and a few surprises that I won't spoil the game is a lot of fun. The game also comes with a fantastic soundtrack, one of the best I've listened to in a long time. Whilst it's not going to be anyone's game of the year Planet diver is a great fun and is probably a really good pick up.\n","December 5, 2015","true","2.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The game's quick gameplay is suited for small sessions on the go, but larger play sessions will have you realizing that the depth of the game is suspect. I like some of the mechanics to extend gameplay, as the objective based gameplay like hugging walls at top speed or hitting enemies while they are jumping from wall to wall. The basic core gameplay does work, but it's lack of variety will hurt over a period of time, despite having a little bit of creative objectives. and some creative ones at that. I do appreciate the nostalgia trip the game plays too, as while some thematic elements may not work there, but anyone who includes Lucca from Chrono Trigger as a playable character gets an extra point or two from me (full disclosure: Chrono Trigger is one of my favorite games of all time, and Lucca is one of my favorite characters.) There are a bunch of fun elements in the game, but the game is much more suited to its mobile counterpart, and it can't keep up the action in the long run. I have to recommend the mobile version of the game specifically, but not the PC version.\n\n\nGameplay Footage and Video Review:  https://youtu.be/sAzrEDDJGSk\n\nLists:\n+:\nThe core gameplay is reasonable. In particular , when the game is playing to its own speed element, it definitely works in terms of action gameplay, moving from side and side of the screen while avoiding obstacles.\nSimple control scheme works. Can see it working on the mobile platform as well, but it allows for simple reactionary gameplay.\nObjective based gameplay has a couple of good options when it comes down to it, like hugging the walls at top speed, or hitting enemies in mid air flight.\nGood side-grades and different playstyles in the store.\nHigh frame rate to complement the gameplay in question.\nAppreciate the options available for resolution, although I'll get to the negatives about that in a bit.\nLucca is a playable character. From Chrono Trigger. This makes me happy.\n-:\nThe game shows its mobile roots, hard. In particular, the game's perspective is too pulled back, not having you focus on the action, and hurts the overall gameplay. While mobile games when working towards the platform's advantages can work, here it didn't go that far.\nFurther more,the UI really is out of place compared to everything else. The information is hard to see and takes you out of the action as opposed to complementing it.\nThe game's is at its best when it's at top speed. Which its then weird when so many objectives are going against that speed element. While yes, you get more starstuff when going faster, it's not necessary in the end.\nSome color choices for levels do a bad job of complementing gameplay. It can be hard to see elements of the walls that blend into the background while moving fast and at the perspective the game has shown.\nMusic doesn't suit the aesthetic here. I mean, I love fallout-type music as much as the next person, but it felt out of place here.\nThere's some weird control elements for the Menus. Escape being a confirmation button at points is just plain weird.\nSome weird slow down in places, in particular with tutorial levels and the information on screen.\nNo quick retry button. Makes too much sense to have it. Some strange elements too. Start on the first uncompleted mission when on the stage selection screen. Not level number 1.","December 1, 2015","false","5.7"," 13 of 28 people (46%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","46","13","28","3","1"

I mean it might've been fun to play in 1988 in burst sessions fighting your friends off a single PC with your elbows! And when a twitch-reflex arcade lags because it is made up on trashy Unity engine I can't in sober mind recommend it. Also I can barely read fonts in menu on my 30' fullscreen cause of scanlines or smth, even worse than in real old games.\n\nМне очень нравятся артистичные игры, но эта вся сводится к пиксельному искусству и музыке в стиле свинг, а процесс игры напоминает о временах языка Бейсик. В смысле, я бы, наверное, с удовольствием порубился в это году в 1988 с короткими подходами, отпихивая друзей локтями от единственного компьютера! А когда игра на скорость реакции тормозит по вине дурацкого движка Единство, тут уж я не могу порекомендовать ее в трезвом уме. Кроме того, я с трудом разбираю шрифты в меню из-за полосок, имитирующих электронную древность, и это на 30-дюймовом мониторе на весь экран, хуже чем в старых играх.","December 2, 2015","false","1.7"," 14 of 32 people (44%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","44","14","32","5","6"
