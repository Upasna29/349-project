"old school". but the further you play you ask yourself "what am i doing with my life right now?"\n\ni guess the developer should ask himself the same question, because this is a robbery.\n\nand its a shame that you try to shut everyone up while you ask for help for your little game studio at the same time.\n\n\nive personally given away about 50 keys for your game, to friends and people in my steam list, to make them happy. and when i want to say thank you in your hub i get banned.\n\nwhat is wrong with you people?\n\nwell maybe i make the end short: stop making games, its better for everyone.\n\n\ni can not recommend buying this.","November 1, 2014","false","1.4"," 3,555 of 3,603 people (99%) found this review helpful 208 people found this review funny","99","555","3","208","114"

It is the worst gaming experience I had in a long time. The game just isn't done very well. It has ugly graphics and looks like it was made 10-15 years ago - by a 12-year-old. The gameplay is so uninspired and boring, it's almost impressive. Almost... All you do is collect ammo and shoot zombies. The zombie AI is bad. All a zombie has to do is follow you. A simple path-finding algorithm. Slaughtering Grounds fails to do even that sometimes (zombies sometimes just don't move). The gunplay is absolutely no fun. The guns don't feel very good. You don't feel a kick or something. If a game offers only so little gameplay, this gameplay better be good. In this case, it isn't.\n\nAside from that the game is buggy and has horrible performance. I have a quite powerful machine and can't run this game at a playable framerate. There are obviously significant memory leaks. When a map is loaded, i get the full 60 fps. But that lasts only for a few seconds. The framerate drops rapidly, until it reached like 15 fps. 15 fps is just completely unplayable. There are also other problems (like the menu, which doesn't work correctly - e.g. I can't exit the game; after clicking that everything just freezes).\n\nI posted my opinion in the game's forum here on Steam. I was perma-banned pretty fast. I didn't use bad language or something. I just wrote how i feel about my "experience" with the game. I also mentioned that the dev's have a habit of deleting threads and banning people - which they both did.\n\nWell, to sum this up: the game is incredibly bad and the dev's should be ashamed for the behaviour they have shown in the last months. So would i recommend it? Hell, no!

FOR THE LOVE OF WHATEVER YOU FIND HOLY DO NOT SPEND MONEY ON THIS.\n\nBefore even getting to the bad behavior of the devs, let's look at the game.  It's thirty minutes of badly cobbled together bought Unity assets and possibly stolen assets (at the very least the cover art was stolen assets), saddled with a poorly thought out HUD, non-intuitive "quest" markers, and a level-design that can only be called pedestrian at best.  There were kids making Duke Nukem 3D mods in the 90's that were better than this.\n\nNow on to the devs:  They've taken to banning anyone on the forum, for any spurious reason.  Ask a question? BAN.  Post a negative review? BAN.  Mention anything about the game? BAN.  Thank them for a beta key?  BAN.  The attempt to stifle and cut off discussion of, well, ANYTHING on the community hub is terrible to begin, but the level of delusion and corruption that these developers suffer sinks even lower.\n\nTheir inability to take criticism has led them to harassing, attempting public shaming of, and filing a false DMCA claim against reviewer Jim Sterling.  They started with a pitiful "Review the Reviewer" video series attempting to mock Jim Sterling's honest reaction in his first impressions of the game, taking it even further by impersonating him on the forums as "JimFnSterlingSon", and now have filed a false DMCA claim against his first impressions video (criticism is clearly covered under fair use, something that the developers do not seem to understand).\n\nThe developers have shown themselves time and again as bullies, thieves, and cowards and have no place in the gaming industry.  No amount of morbid curiousity should sway you into spending money on this, the developers don't deserve it.","November 9, 2014","false","0.2"," 324 of 326 people (99%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","99","324","326","5","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Roserin/recommended/329950/","Roserin","❤Roserin❤MissTaxi❤","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Roserin/","978 products in account","The Slaughtering Grounds was a rather interesting game to play. It is also a game that has gained much notoriety because of the Devs, but we will set this aside and focus entirely on the game.\n\nGameplayIn a game without any sort of story or extra game modes (aside from multiplayer which is pretty much just single player with more people, assuming you find someone to play with), gameplay is, and should be the strongest point of this game, but comes out being a bit lacking in this department. The game encloses you into an arena like map which lasts an allocated amount of time, which is around 20 minutes, then the map switches. The maps all seem to look the same once you play 2, where the only notable difference is that one is daytime and the other is nighttime. There is no way to win, unless time runs out, there a new “map” is loaded. There is an objective panel in the top left of your screen that never changes, even if you complete the objectives there, you just keep repeating them. Should you fail to complete an objective, you will hear “try again” and the timer will reset for that objective. The only thing completing objectives seems to do is spawn a “boss” which looks hilarious because of the way it runs at you, but the only notable difference is how much more ridiculous of these bosses look, because they die with very little effort. If you do kill a boss, money will be dropped, which stays on the ground for about a minute, and since the normal zombies seldom sense you, you are pretty much free to walk in circles in the money to continue collecting it. The zombies that are spawned throughout the map just stare and wait for a player to come near enough to be seen by the terrible AI. The AI is so horrible you can stand a few feet from a zombie and it many cases, it won’t attack unless you are practically touching it. There is also no accuracy loss for shooting the gun unzoomed, as compared to zoomed in, nor for shooting while sprinting. If you do happen to die, there is no penalty, making the death a bit for show, even if it’s an unimpressive death.  You will likely be only using the starting character and his shotgun, since it’s a 1 shot kill in most cases, and it’s pretty much pointless to unlock anything else since there is no incentive, nor benefit. You will also only gain ammo for the gun currently being held, for who knows that reason. The power-ups can be mistakenly shot, because they make an invisible wall when not picked up.  Thankfully though, there is now some small indication you are being attacked from behind, which is a blood splatter on screen, but can become rather tedious since it is not an immediate warning and lasts until death, or completely full heath. Thus making it rather pointless and distracting, since it’s always on screen and you cannot tell if the stain is from the last time you were attacked or if you are currently being attacked.\n\nAudio/AestheticsThere is this infernal drum beat that keeps repeating, that will get stuck in your head after 10 minutes, not because its catchy and nice, but because it’s repetitive, annoying, and louder than most of the sound effects. The game and its assets all look horrible, and do not match, plus they are literally just slapped on and not even made to look like they belong to the same game. You will see zombies in tuxedos, prisoner zombies, weird ghoul zombies…you get the point, unless we’re doing a James Bond Jail thing here, I don’t see how they all go together. Many of the props are lazily put together, since you can shoot and jump through windows without them shattering. You can walk through trees and even through various other props such as tankers, though zombies cannot, which means you can stand there and do nothing whatsoever if you like. It is also not uncommon for you to just get stuck while sprinting up a staircase. Why? Well who knows, maybe your character is clumsy and gets his foot stuck, or gains weight while exercising, making him too wide to fit.\n\nVerdict: 1.5/10\n\n+.05 was given for making me laugh for the first 10 minutes, though it does get old for the remainder of the play through, if you can manage more than 15 minutes. I was going to include a section for glitches, but that would encompass most of the gameplay.

Of course don't expect Steam to do a damn thing and most likely we will be seeing another game by this dev in the near future because they can. Also the Dev(s) are/is probably young as they posted a video paradying Jim Sterlings video of it with subtitles, here's a link to Jim Sterlings take on that video with the full video in the background.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WT0GSPxf0vw&list=UUWCw2Sd7RlYJ2yuNVHDWNOA\n\nSteam, get your ♥♥♥♥ together.\n\nReview:\nSo...Where do I begin?\nLet's start with the graphics, they aren't good but I don't judge a game by it's a graphics so that won't effect this review however there are alot that will.\n\n---Gameplay---\nThe games gameplay is all about killing mutants in a map filled with them similar to games such as killing floor however this game is not nearly as fun. You begin the game with loud music that you can only turn on and off although going to singleplayer or entering the Multiplayer servers (It's an entirely new menu with a new background) will cause the music to turn back on. When in the actual game you start with a shotgun with a starting ammo count of 8, yes 8 shells. The gun is extremely powerful but when you change to your revolver, guess what? 8 Bullets aswell, there are ammo crates scattered around but they are so few and only give you 8 bullets. The game controls nicely but I found alot of lag issues which could be my computer as it's not that powerful.\n\n--Customisation--\n\nYou begin with 1 character and 2 weapons, in total their are 3 characters each with 2 guns, the characters cost 3k but I found it hard to actually get much money. You can upgrade your weapons for 1k. I think the most insulting thing ever is the menus for this, they don't function properly, how? Well you press right to go right and left to go...Right? Yes no matter which arrow you click it goes right/left, I would say the same about the weapons however you only have 2 per character so there's no way to know.\n\n---Multiplayer---\nI can't comment wholey on MP and how it works but from what I managed to do (by myself because no one was playing on the server) is that it is SP with people. There is a dedicated server which is good.\n\n---Conclusion---\n\nThis game right now is not worth it, I do have hope that it will change in the future and improve but for now it lacks features. I give it a 4/10 for being a good idea but not well executed, hopefully they will add more maps, weapons and characters in the future.\n\n---YouTube Video---\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkzEUUJJofM","November 4, 2014","false","0.3"," 284 of 292 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","284","292","0","3"

Slaughtering grounds doesnt have a story. You are just thrown into a map and you kill everything that moves. But will you want to buy and play this game ? The answer is no. Stay as far away as possible from piece of ♥♥♥♥ing garbage. Right off the game im gonna say theres nothing good about this game. NOTHING. The game graphiclly looks like somebody chewed up killing floor and barfed it out. Gameplay wise the game controls like complete garbage and its not fun in any way. When youre put in a map you get to choose diffrent charecters who come with diffrent weapons but that doesnt change anything because all of the guns are just reskins and take all enemies out in one shot. The game is incredibly boring as well. You are put in a map and youre main objective is to survive for 15 minutes. And you have optional goals and one of them is glitched. For the maps. Theyre generic level design and really hard to navigate because the radar doesnt work. Overall The Slaughtering Grounds is a joke of  a game  the only reason you should buy it is because its gonna get removed from steam. Otherwise stay away from this piece of garbage at all costs.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/329950/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2818 products in account","Right, The Slaughtering Ground;  this is a first-person shooter and was released on October 31st 2014. It is well known for its poor quality and infamous attack on Jim Sterling's video review of the game; however I am going to give it a break down as to why this game is as bad as it sounds.\n\nThe gameplay of Slaughtering Grounds is simple; you are dropped into a map and you have one aim; kill zombies. While this premise of an idea is not exactly rare these days on any game; some how Slaughtering Grounds manages to not even cover the basics. Lets start off with the gun play - there is zero amount of realism when it comes to how the guns work. When you try and aim down the iron-site, all that happens is the gun changes position and you just end up seeing the gun from a different angle. You start off with 10 bullets in your weapon; now that isn't a bad thing but as soon as you spawn you have to deal with at least 20 zombies before you can find your way to a ammo drop so you end up getting mobbed.\n\nWhile we are on the topic of being mobbed...if you are being attacked from behind, the game gives no audible clues or easily noticeable visuals to warn you of this, apart from your small health bar. You can be happily (I use that term very loosely) walking around the map, unaware that you are actually being followed and stabbed in the back by a hoard of zombies and suddenly your camera angle is going 90° and you are dead.\n\nEach stage has a number of different challenges which rewards money upon completing them. Kill a certain number of zombies, explode  zombies and get a varying amount of head-shots. Fair enough they add an extra depth to the gameplay but  to be honest, I found no way at all how you can explode zombies, and even if you are aiming directly at the head of an enemy, the game will not recognize you have shot it.\n\nThe graphics, oh god the graphics. These are some of the most diabolical graphics I have ever seen in a recent video game. It feels as if I am back in 1994 playing a release title on the PlayStation, and even then I am being generous. All of the models and textures have been stolen from other products and bare no new or creative input by the developers. The lighting effects on the first stage are laughably bad. You will get random light effects in side a building and then all of a sudden it will change completely and it'll be pitch black. Nothing makes sense....\n\nAs well as the above mentioned audio issues with being attacked by zombies, the horrible repeated Chinese style music that is repeated over, and over, and over and over and over....you get the point, gets extremely boring VERY fast. Each different level has no new music the same DUM DUM DUMDUMDUM in the background. I hated it!\n\nThe game is not hard though, once you get a hefty supply of shotgun ammo, nothing will kill you, apart from the game breaking bugs where you can get stuck in walls, fall through the floor, or just randomly drop dead for no apparent reason. When you do die, it seems you get no penalty either though, you just re spawn with the same amount of money, the same ammo and weapons, bonus I guess?  Apart from these bugs, the game is riddled with issues, I struggled to get even 30 fps on my rig, the game stutters and loads incredibly slowly, the only reason I can think of is because the game was coded by a room full of monkeys.\n\nSlaughtering Grounds is currently on sale for 15p. Do I recommend it for 15p? You may as well put an extra few pennies aside and treat yourself to a Freddo. You will get more enjoyment out of the 10 seconds it takes to eat it than you will playing this game. I have spent one hour too many playing this game; but I thought it was only fair I played it for a substantial amount of time before casting my judgement; but please, do not give these disgusting developers any more money than they have some how already managed to generate.  This is the worst game I have ever played in 19 years of gaming.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

I've played this game longer than I should have and I have to say it's quite ♥♥♥♥ to say the least. The game is your average arena zombie horde shooter with nothing to benefit from the genre, nothing really matters.\n\nYou are dropped into a map and you shoot endless zombies picking up health and ammo that you eventually need as well and money that you can use on the main menu to unlock characters and upgrades while gradually hearing "congratulations" or "Amazing" like you're friggin playing Quake. That's about it, no objectives no plot, no penalty for dying...nothing accept what every twelve year old thinks is cool. When you die you keep any money you've collected while the 15 minute timer continues on until it runs out and you progress to the next stage. Yes you don't have to play to progress because the game mechanic operates on a timer ALLOWING you to move to the next stage once time runs out. Enemies are obviously taken from other game sources, the bigger monsters you encounter faze through into buildings and the game is a complete insult to anyone who bought it. This isn't even a  properly constructed game, it's a scam and should be removed from Steam along with Digital Homicide's account.","January 25, 2015","false","1.2"," 137 of 140 people (98%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","98","137","140","12","6"

Up there with the likes of Daikatana for the Nintendo 64, and Elite Forces: Navy SEALS, The Slaughtering Grounds is what happens when a person does not understand the fundamentals of game design, nor cares to.\n\nWhere to begin?\n\nThe title screen of the game, which is used as a central hub for buying weapons and characters is a complete mess. Never mind the fact that I believe they used Arial as the font for the menu screens, the actual menu itself is visually apalling. Enemies that spawn in the background can be seen dropping into the actual menu, and the background itself is not composed in a visually stimulating way. Gee, Digital Homicide doesn't understand shot composition? Say it ain't so.\n\nDelving into the actual game now, it's a complete clusterf*ck. For the first 10 seconds, your mouse cursor is out of alignment with the default weapon. It corrects itself, but this is laughably stupid. The goal of the game is to survive for 15 minutes, but there's no real reason to move from the spot you spawn at. The game doesn't, at any point, give you a reason to traverse the (ugly as hell) world you're put in. Exploration in the game only leads you to more zombies, as the game has no real goal beyond survival. The weapons themselves are decent, and I mean this purely from a weapon model perspective. They handle as if you were on drugs. They sway from side to side, as if you were standing on a boat and their ADS (aim-down-sights) seem to lag for a moment before you can actually see them.\n\nAmmo for said weapons is spread through the levels, but because this was baby's first FPS, you can only grab ammo for the weapon you're currently holding. You can also pick up mines, but they will get you killed because of the horrible implementation, or lack thereof, of any real collision detection. Meaning that you can literally plant them in the ground, and walk right over them if you've forgotten they're there. The least Digital Homicide could have done in a case like this is had an animation of the player model digging up dirt with a cute pink shovel.\n\nAlas, there are no kawaii shovels in this game.\n\nThe zombie AI ranges from absolutely horrendous, to non-existent. Their radar for movement could be described as broken, as it only seems to work half the time. You can outrun them, even if they do notice you. I'm not sure they can go up stairs. At one point in each level, the zombies become "FRENZIED" and seem to be a bit smarter. In reality, they run around the map, so their radar is almost guaranteed to pick you up.\n\nBeyond all these problems, the game is marred by glitches and bugs as well. During my play of the game, I saw an airplane flying sideways. It then disappeared into a void, although it likely just collided with the horrendous skybox. There's elevator shafts that you can stand on in the first level, but there's no ground to them, so you're basically standing on air. My health went down to -2% once, a feat which I haven't been able to replicate in any other game yet, sadly.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that every asset in this game is almost 100% sure to be bought from the Unity Asset Store. Because Digital Homicide are a group of hacks who don't understand game design, nor care to.\n\nThis game is currently being sold for 14 cents. Don't buy it.\n\nAnd don't buy it for your friends either.","September 6, 2015","false","0.6"," 85 of 88 people (97%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","97","85","88","16","0"

I gave a look at the characters and decided to get all of them before I even got in.\nWent in, shots were fired. No ammo left. Ran around completely lost looking for ammo. Died. Died so many times I wanted to punch something. Didn't. Just quit the game.\n\nAt this point I had like 1000 in cash.\n\nCame back, same thing but I stuck it out to the apparent transition to the next map. This map. THIS MAP. THIS IS WHAT THE FIRST ONE SHOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE. There's plenty of room to run around, there's ammo and  health packs everywhere and taking out the zs was fun and didn't cluster around me and forced me to use more than one bullet for a headshot. The Shotgun was especially helpful in this map. EVERYTHING DIED.\n\nAfter that slaughter fest, I got sent back to the first map (:<) but had a much better understanding of "survival". Instead of using all of the start off ammo, I shot anyone in front of me while running around looking for the places that stuff spawns in.\nAfter repeating the two maps once more, I went on to Multiplayer because I didn't click Singleplayer (I accidentally clicked multiplayer) -- remember this if you keep playing -- The amount of money you get in Multiplayer is more than you get in Single. I managed to get the characters only an hour after release of the Beta, and upgraded the 3rd class.\n\nThe second map though. Holy ****. I can't emphasize this enough. There was ammo left and right, so I managed to stack up to 1000 bullets for the M4 and the glock while gracefully smashing each and every single zombie-monsters head with a single glock bullet in 15 minutes. Sometimes 2 if the game felt like being realistic (or I just missed the first time).\nThe only reason /why/ I actually managed to go on longer than 10 minutes was the music. I can say without a doubt that I want the song so I can listen to it every day until I'm sick of it.\n\nNow would one want to buy it? Not really. Although I did have fun doing things with absolute no consequences, the game as a whole -- is not even one could consider in beta. It's just plain ♥♥♥♥. There is nothing to it. Nothing that makes it stand out (other than the fact that I don't need to listen to anyone and can do what I want while shooting stuff :>). It was clearly not ready for it's beta title -- this needs a lot more work before it can even become subpar.\n\nI haven't bought any Greenlight games that I've voted even though there are many games that I really do want simply because I lack the funds. However. I will be buying this for sure when I can. Simply because of the joy it gives me when I want to kill ♥♥♥♥ for giggles in a different way.","November 18, 2014","false","8.2"," 82 of 89 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","82","89","2","3"

And it's HORRIBLE. First, the menu is an abomination. Second, it's a mess of default unity assets mixed up with one of the worst AI I've ever seen. It's a total nonsense. The song is a free rap song I heard a while ago, that loops over, and over, and over. It gets annoying after the third loop. The blood splatters are EXACTLY the same blood sprites I found on google some months ago, and I used them for a photoshop job I had to do for my school. You can walk THROUGH windows (Non-destroyed windows. With the glass and everything), the ammount of glitches is amazing (I saw a plane flying sideways while dropping some crap), and the worst of all: It's a generic damn shooter. You can clearly see that the developer placed NO effort onto this game. The netcode is horrible. The zombies, if you can call them that way, are damn weak. ANY weapon kills them in one hit. Aside, what the hell? There's like a nazi general zombie, a mime-like zombie, and other sprites that look a lot like the sprites you can download for free to add on any game. I dare to say even a 10-12 year old kid can make a better game than this, in just a few hours.\n\nThis game, is one of the few games I really hate. This, is from my point of view, even worse than bad rats. I mean, bad rats is WAY more enjoyable than this game, with it's cheap 60's porno music and bad physics.\n\nEven if I got this for free, I demand a refund. Oh, and strangely, almost every positive review come from accounts that have just one review, and luckily, one game.\n\nThis game is a mess. 0/10\n\nEDIT: This review is disliked by 1 person only.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RitsukaAoy/recommended/329950/","RitsukaAoy","Wang Yao","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RitsukaAoy/","159 products in account","I got this game from a friend, as a joke. Jokes on him however, this game is one of the best out there.\n\nI started playing this game, and after exactly 38 minutes, I had unlocked every character and all the weapons. Keep in mind, I bought TWO guns and two characters, and that was it. I felt an incredibly sense of accomplishment that I had managed such a feat.\n\nWhere to even begin with this gem? I suppose I could begin with the beautifully crafted menu for the game. When you start the game for the first time, you are greeted by a man named Snake, a biker in his right environment, and two zombies that drops down like ragdolls behind him, and believe it or not, some pretty good music, for the first 15 seconds before it starts all over again, but you have the choice of turning the music off, which is always a pleasant feauture to have available.\n\nAbove the characters once you've bought them, it says "Owned" in big red letters. Very convincing, now I'm certain I don't have to buy these characters again every time I boot up the game.\n\nYou have the ability to upgrade your character and guns. For the guns you have three available choices; Ammo Load, Reload Rate and Damage. I have played this game for almost two hours, and have only managed to upgrade my AK-47 to 110% out of 150%. If you feel like upgrading every gun to the maximum, only to get this flashing light saying "Max Upgrade Level Reached!", you have around 12 hours give or take of incredible fun, 24 if you want to upgrade your characters too! That text is everything you will get from spending 2 hours worth of ingame money on upgrades, so you better ♥♥♥♥ing be grateful, because I can promise you that I was.\n\nThe two other characters can be bought for 1000 credits each, a hard task for anyone that's not a veteran of this game.  I have to mention that this one scary dude, named Bob, apperantly has had extensive military training. I'm left wondering if this is a lie, or if the biker Snake also had extensive military training. The next man we get to know doesn't even have a name. All we know is that he is an ex-member of the LAPD Swat Team, which according to the description have a solid set of skills. He would need that to be exactly like Bob the scary dude and the biker anarchist Snake.\n\nReally the only other options you have on this screen is Multiplayer and Singleplayer. I haven't even bothered to play multiplayer, but if you click it, the only way to get back to the menu is by pressing Exit and quit the game, or press ESC and quit the game. I mean, who needs a return button anyway.\n\nOnce you click Singleplayer, you're in for a treat. Memories you will cherish for a long time. This game has a UI that's incredibly pleasing to look at, and is unbelievably user friendly. The total kills is above the first gun in the selection, the ammo above the secondary gun, the cash is placed above the mine and the health is convineantly placed above the tripmine. When you pick up ammo, the ammo goes to the gun you're currently holding, there isn't two types of ammo in this game, which is totally great. You'll get used to it.\n\nLet's not forget the radar, the detailed green square with white/yellowish dots signefying zombies. If a zombie is in front of you, it shows up at the bottom of the radar, which means it's behind you. This radar is important, considering the fact that if you're hit by a zombie, you won't notice it until you're "dead", so I'm grateful that it works perfectly, like it does it every other game, ever.\n\nBy this point, we will have reached death. It's not really death I suppose, you can slide around on the ground and shoot at zombies and explode your own mines and tripmines while you have been torn to pieces by several zombies. Everyone's dream. That is, if you switch fast enough to your second gun once you've died. Not to mention, there is absolutely no death penalty in this game. Not one. Except for losing your ammo. No, wait, you just have to switch to the other gun and back, and you're golden. You can't pause either, so go drink a cup of tea if you fancy and die a thousand times, it doesn't really matter. Another great thing about this game. I love it.\n\nYou have 3 challenges at the top left of the screen which are as following: Perform 10 headshots, Kill 10 zombies and Blow up 10 zombies. To add to these amazing challenges, you get a certain time in which to complete them in, giving you a sense of... challenge. The Blow up 10 zombies challenge doesn't work, great! That's just less work to deal with. I wonder what my reward is for getting those other two challenges are? Well, you get this pixelated blood splatter all over your top screen saying "BLOOD BATH" or you get the words "RAMPAGE", making you feel like a badass. Then you proceed to do the same two challenges over and over and over, listening to the same guy screaming the words. Once he yelled "VICTORY". I'm fairly sure the word victory doesn't exactly work when you've killed a few zombies, or even finished one challenge. Did nobody look this word up in the dictionary?\n\nYou have 15 minutes to play a level, before it throws you into the next level, with no loading screen. That's right people, this game has no loading screens, not one, it just throws you right in. The future is here. The first level was fairly simple, the same few building on what I can only assume is a construction site filled with zombies. Once you're about 1/3 into the 15 minutes, a message pops up saying "THE ZOMBIES HAVE BECOME FREEZED". No, wait... It says that they have become frenzied in a easy to read font which stays up for 2 seconds. Good game design.\n\nThen the map proceeds to get a blue light all over it, and the zombies are as they always were, incredibly powerful and scary. Thank god for that, if it became any more difficult I don't think I would have ever managed to finish this game.\n\nThe second level was up. 15 minutes was the time I had to stay alive. Not too hard, considering this level is ten times as easy as the first, almost no zombies and tons of health and ammo packs, which respawned by the time I had plowed through one house.\n\nAt random times, a second message shows up, saying "I will swallow your soul!" or "I smell fresh meat!" in a scary font, sure to give you a fright. Then if you're lucky, 10% of the time a boss will show up. I came face to face with the most detailed ogre like creature, wealding a stone pickaxe, and I was ready for the boss fight of my life. I killed it with two bullets out of the 500 I had collected. What an achievment. This was the second boss. I assume that I missed the first one on the first level. Great, I didn't want the reward for that boss anyway, right?\n\nThe third boss was a gigantic werewolf, which I spent 50 bullets on before he killed me and became invincible, and proceeded to kill me 7 times before the time went down and I won the level. Now onto the third level, which is the same as the second, except that your FOV is zoomed in twice or thrice as much. The only reason I can think about a reason for this is the fact that they tried to make you feel like you're playing a different level, and it worked, for the first three seconds of the level. Not that it matters, the second level had incredibly good design, so it was fun to run around in circles for another 15 minutes zoomed in so much that I could count the pixels of the grass. Enjoyable.\n\nOnce the ticker hit zero, I started on the first level again. Exactly the same as it was the first time around. That was fun, let's do that again.\n\n> Honourable mentions:\n#1 Gun skins have recoil, but the aim never moves at all, great, I always hated to have recoil, we all did.\n#2 ADS makes it more difficult to see what you're shooting at, but why would you want that?\n\nI can only write so much when recommending this game, I could write two more long texts like this about this fantastic game, but I think l will have to end it here.\n\n/Sarcasm","June 19, 2015","true","8.9"," 281 of 413 people (68%) found this review helpful 402 people found this review funny","68","281","413","402","18"

I don't own the best laptop, but when I play in fullscreened 640 x 480 with the lowest graphics possible I expect to at least muster a playable fps and minimal input lag. That is not possible with this game. I don't know Unity too well, but I reckon this could be fixed through ragdoll, gib, and spawnrate tweaks.\n- No punishment for dying, you simply respawn, retaining your previous amount of ammo and cash. Actually, I take that back, the only punishment for dying is a bug responsible for taking some of your newly regained health away upon spawning.\n- No in-game look sensitivity adjustment.\n- Highly obstructive HUD.\n- Trees, telephone booths, mailboxes, etc. almost all foilage and beauty objects in this game aren't interactable, meaning you can walk right through them.\n- HUD blood effects and messages such as 'BLOOD BATH', 'RAMPAGE', etc are sloppily displayed. The low resolution and white around the edges leave me convinced that these effects were edited with Microsoft Paint.\n- Negative health? Not necessarily an issue but it feels wierd dying with -%9997 health after stepping on my own landmine, whoops.\n\nI'll be sure to add more to this list in the near future. I had a lot more thaings to add but I keep forgetting. If the dev comes across this I just want them to know that in my opinion, the most apparent gameplay hinder is the ridiculous FPS drop. Once that is fixed, the game will at least be playable.","April 17, 2015","false","12.8"," 38 of 38 people (100%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","100","38","38","7","1"

You start off with a biker dude but can unlock more characters with unique weapons with cash you get from killing zombies. As soon as you start the game you are greeted with this small loop of music that is kind of catchy but will quickly get on your nerves as it is the only song in the game. And then you actually start the game and quickly wish you hadn't. You will occasionally spawn in a very unfortunate position and quickly lose a good chunk of health to zombies while quickly moving away. Zombies don't even attack, they will either stare at you or slap the air three feet away from you both of which cause damage somehow.\n\nWell is gameplay fun you are probably thinking. Nope! The gunplay is extremely floaty and contact with zombies is very unsatisfying. Even worse is that you run out of ammo very quickly and have to go around the map searching for floating ammo crates for a pathetic amount of ammo to use and so the cycle continues indefinitely. All the while a horde of useless zombies slowly walk behind you posing no real threat. It is like a game of helping old people walk down the street as many zombies are also prone to stay in one place zoned out without a care in the world.  There are also health packs and mines littered around the map. Mines are useless though since they are only capable of taking out a single zombie even in a large swarm.\n\nWell what happens if you are somehow killed by the zombies? Absolutely nothing, you just respawn without your mines but still have the same amount of ammo. That means if you die without ammo you will have to walk all the way over to an ammo crate and repeat that vicious cycle of needing ammo. At this point you will probably pause the game to rethink what you are dong with you life but good luck with that! All that does is bring up a sign in front of your character and everything else functions the same as it does while not paused. You can still walk, enemies can still attack you but now you can't shoot or walk sideways. Don't worry though. Even if you are at 0% health you can still walk around.\n\nAt this point you are probably praying that the 15 minutes to survive are nearly over and you take a glance at the timer. Well good luck figuring out what amount of time is left since the timer is prone to glitch out and start showing random bits of numbers. So you had enough, go to the top of a building and jump. Hah, nice try buddy, there is no fall damage! So on you walk and walk leading a horde of zombies like if the pied piper found a rotten skin flute and start humming along to the haunting loop of the same song that has been playing nonstop all this time. Forget about the nonfunctional timer, forget about the sweet prospect of death that will never come and continue walking all over the map, around and around.\n\nAn unspecified amount of time later you remember you have a gun in your hands and are supposed to kill these old pe...err, zombies. So bam bam bam! You kill and run around collecting the money they drop for the purpose of buying a bigger clip to to kill them more efficiently. And then you remember why you stopped killing in the first place. You are essentially doing the same thing walking around the map but now you searching for ammo. The zombies are still slowly walking behind you posing no real threat and you realize that YOU are the monster. Wow, this game is deep, such a beautiful message.....and the timer runs out, teleporting you to a new map. In which case the only correct course of action is to Alt+F4 out of the game and delete system32 to stop the evil you just witnessed. Highly recommended if you hate yourself and need that extra push into the depths of madness.","May 21, 2015","false","1.6"," 28 of 29 people (97%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","97","28","29","7","4"

There is no penalty for dying whatsoever, and no objectives to go for. It's just a big arena with enemies for you to click on. And while there's some variety among the horde, they all have the exact same AI and animations, essentially making them the same enemy. Once in a while the game will announce that "Zombies have become frenzied!", though I've noticed no change in behavior whatsoever. Also once in a while a boss monster will show up, such as a giant troll/devil/werewolf thing, but they die in one hit so there's no point to take them seriously. And again, there's no penalty for death at all, so they're not a threat in the slightest.\n\nThere are several characters and weapons to unlock, along with upgrades to your health and armor purchasable with ingame currency. But once again, there's no point in buying upgrades to your health and armor since dying carries no penalty. And there's no point to getting the other characters, since the starting character's shotgun is already the best weapon in the game.\n\nThe level design is also incredibly lazy. Entire buildings are copy-pasted into different maps, and a large abundance of trees and shrubbery just add visual noise, covering up enemies and pickup items alike. Enemies tend to tweak out on walls, and you can jump through windows like nothing is there.\n\nI think the one nice thing I can say about this game is the shooting works. Shots hit where I aim, and I can move and jump around pretty well. The controls aren't floaty, and aiming is easy.\n\nAll in all, the game is just incredibly boring. There's only three maps, and basically one enemy type. There's no bigger goal outside of "kill zombies", as the game just moves you to another map as soon as time is up. It's an absolutely mindless shooter, and isn't really worth buying.","May 1, 2015","false","1.2"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","16","16","2","0"

If you are feel at moment as low as I am, you'll buy it in a bundle of "Digital Homicide pack", with 80% discount, and get all the cards from all of those so-called "games". And you probably raise a buck or two in the process.\nBut seriously, even schoolboys today shouldn't be as low as that "gamedev studio" is.\n\n"The Slaughtering grounds" is a very bad way to spend your time and energy, even if you're idling all the way through.\nThis is one of those "products", based on Unity engine, which is downgrading the very meaning of gaming (and discredits engine). It is as ugly, as any zombie from the screenshots you see, and even more. And it is a crummy port from touchpad.\n\nI tried to give it a shot. After the start I saw a closed square of space with some buildings and other obstacles, and many-many respawning zombies. I make some shots from the revolver I had, it felt as unnatural, as a man in strings, and even worse. I killed 4 undead with 6 shots, then I discovered that I don't have bullets. Yeah, a kiss from 90's - picking a fight with countless enemies with one clip. Then I discovered I have a shotgun, and made my way to some ammo packs. I even learned about mines and grenade stretches... but wow, I am talking like you can actually PLAY in this! No. C'mon, it is a mindless arena FPS without any positive aspects, where zombies respawning behind your back and you can't hear them coming. Where zombies walking freely through walls, like they are ghosts, and taking a bite of you and then diving back to the wall, and you can't shoot them! And you can't redifine controls, which is very sluggish, so all your top-notch keyboard+mouse skills will be of no use there...\n\nIt was very bad as a timekiller on touchpads, but on the PC it is a complete disaster.

We had a little game where I'd rub my ♥♥♥♥ over the lesions until they burst. Interesting fact: whatever spurts out is an excellent lubricant. We'd continue our little foreplay session for a while, usually until I was soaked from pelvis to knees in the grayish-orange lube.\n\nThen, things would heat up. She'd drop to her knees and take me in her mouth. One little thing we used to laugh about was the presence of this one pustule right on her kneecap that always came back after it burst, and when she put it down onto the hardwood floor it popped with an audible "plipt". I knew it was coming, but I still giggled as I looked down and saw the fluid seeping across the hardwood and between my toes. It felt good to wiggle them.\n\nAfter a few weeks, I started to become infected with the same condition. My ♥♥♥♥♥ began to look like her leg, although, obviously, much smaller. She loved how it felt inside her. Its exquisite topography reached every spot that made her moan and sigh, plus, as the boils burst during the course of our lovemaking, there was never any shortage of wetness.\n\nAfter I'd finish inside her and we cuddled for a while, she'd always remember to do what I loved most.

Its difficult to even call this a "turn off your brain" game because you constantly need to find more Ammo.\n2. You can clip through a surprising number of objects. You can walk through any tree or gas tank.\n3. Cobbled together from unity assest, you literally could make a better zombie game using Gmod, which is something Jim Sterling hasn't said. You can make a story/mission based GMOD map using the source engine for free and it would have been fine. Instead, a bunch of buggy unity assests were put together into this thing.\n4. Runs like ♥♥♥♥ even on a top of the line computer.\n5. Running on GMOD and not having ammo. I could literally go play Left 4 Dead or just drop a bunch of Zombies into GM_Flatgrass and have the same experience, only more fun because there would be a lot more weapons and I wouldn't run out of ammo.\n6. Actually, I have to thank the Devs. I got a coupon that took 90% off the $1 price tag. I spent $0.10 on this game. Now here's the fun part. Because the Devs took a stab at Jim Sterling, the parody trading card is worth $0.20. I literally made $1 for buying this game. So hey, thanks, losers.","May 5, 2015","false","1.5"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","9","9","0","0"

And I finally fulfilled my destiny...\n\nThis is single-handedly the worst Steam game I've ever played. In fact, scratch that. It's the worst game I've ever played in my entire life. If I were to choose between a deformed stillborn child and this game, I'd snatch the child in a heartbeat.\n\nAnd why does this ill-fated game get the sledgehammer of disapproval? Well, I'll tell you just why that is...\n\nNumber one, the music is attrocious. Y'know how we have those gorgeous games that has an entire soundtrack that somehow manages to make you feel like you're in the game? Well, kiss that soundtrack goodbye! Because this game only has 1 song, and it's a 20 second loop. And after about 1 minute of this song flowing through my mind, I start to feel more crazy and more isolated than Jack Nicholson in The Shining.\n\nNumber two, it feels unfinished. The blood texture after you've taken damage looks like the devs took a Google image and just slapped it straight onto the game with no trace of editing the image. Pretty much the entire game is composed of Unity asset packages. They've just taken assets and placed them in the entire map. (There's only 1 map, believe it or not)\n\nNumber three, It's more boring than watching paint dry. When the entirety of a rushed, bland game is this outrageously bad it's fair to say that you will never play this game ever again. It makes me depressed just looking at it.\n\nThis is a prime example of why Greenlight shouldn't exist. It allows crappy devs with no real talent to whip up a recipe for disaster. Imminent Uprising, shame on you. You people have nothing to be proud of, except the fact you managed to make a few bucks off this poor excuse for a game and taking down reviews which obviously speak the truth as to why people shouldn't buy this game.\n\nAlso, I got this as a gift, so at least I didn't waste my spare change on this tragic game.","December 16, 2015","false","0.2"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","9","9","2","0"

No, there are no melee weapons. You truly are defenseless. Well, there ARE land mines and trip wire mines, but placing them is kinda awkward when you're being hunted by three or more zombies. Also, an occasional helicopter DOES drop ammo, but it only happens like, every ten or so minutes, and even then, I still don't know WHERE was the ammo dropped. Hell, the only reason I actually do know a helicopter dropped some ammo somewhere is helicopter propeller noise coming from somewhere in the distance. So much for THAT "help".\n\nAlso, there's this one weird thing about ammo itself. The ammo is just ammo. It's never pistol ammo, shotgun ammo and so on. No, it's just... ammo. Like Jim Sterling said, there are no different ammo types, but instead, the ammo you pick up is always going to replenish the ammo of just the gun that you're holding AT THAT EXACT MOMENT.\n\nThe music is just a single track that keeps on repeating. It was catchy in the beginning, but after a while, it gets annoying. Do you know that feeling when your favorite song starts feeling like it came from the deepest pits of hell after you had it as a wake up alarm sound/music/whatever on your cellphone for a couple of days? That's how I feel about this game's only music track.\n\nThe graphics in this game look like absolute ♥♥♥♥. Next to it, Devastation, an FPS that was released in year 2003 (TWO THOUSAND AND ♥♥♥♥ING THREE, as in, TWELVE ♥♥♥♥ING YEARS AGO), looks like ♥♥♥♥ing Skyrim. I know the graphics are not supposed to be the #1 priority, but even then, this is absolute ♥♥♥♥. It even puts Fallout 4's trailer to shame, if I'm to believe what I'm told.\n\nEnemies' pathfinding is a complete disaster. Apparently, they are unable to grasp a simple concept called "doors". When I was just about to step through one, an enemy and I noticed each other through it. BUT, instead of coming at me through those doors, that enemy decided to go around, through those large doors intended for trucks. You know what I'm talking about, right? When I stepped through the normal doors, the enemy decided to run back to me. When I stepped out again, the enemy decided to run to me through those truck sized doors again. Marvelous, isn't it?\n\nIf you want to know what I'm talking about, look up JonTron's video called Top 5 Things That Ruin A Game's Immersion and fast forward to Number 2: ♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI. The first clip he uses for that is the AI in the original Red Faction being unable to comprehend the simple situation of him stepping through the window and, as a result, constantly running from one room to another. That scene is the PERFECT representation of what I was talking about in the above passage.\n\nI guess the game is good for killing a couple of minutes when you don't have anything better to do, but then again, there are so many other games that do exactly that much, MUCH better. In light of that, I just cannot recommend this at all. Just get Killing Floor, okay?","June 13, 2015","false","1.9"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

I specifically remember hearing how digital homicide does NOT want anyone from Jim Sterlings audience to buy and play the game. So I decided to go to steam and to my surprise, the game was only $0.19! Which is a relief because I wouldn't pay anything more than $0.49 for this attrocious piece of crap of a game. I mean, 19 cents? It's practically free, it's like taking 1 dime, 1 nickle and 4 pennies out of my jar so I've got nothing to lose.\n\nWhen I started playing the game, my immediate experiecne was frustraiting. The controls were beyond horrendous! The ammunition would run out fast and as soon as I ran out, I was screwed. I kept on dying. I tried real hard to find ammo, but thats a little hard to do when a horde of zombies keeps on chasing and killing you. Not to mention you move like a slug in this game. So finding ammo, avoiding enemies immediatly becomes a chore in this piece of sh*t of a game. I mean this was NOT fun at the very least. I only played it for 15 minutes and I am already sick of it. I deleted it from my library and will never play it again.\n\nRemember digital homicide! As a member of Jim Sterlings audience, I was gonna take his word for it and never buy this game, until you said in the debate with him that you want none of his audience members to buy your game, so I did exactly that. I saw your crappy game on sale for only $0.19 and I decided to buy it. I played it. And its total crap! LOL!!!\n\nAnd remember! Jim F**king Sterling Son sent me!

There are no options to turn it down, the only option is to mute it or blew your eardrums listening to how loud it is.\nThe SFX is horrible. Zombie death sounds go on for way too long, gunshots are completely wrong, genuinely horrible sounds.\n-------------Gunplay-------------\nDue to the fact that your gun points to the center of the screen, there is no crosshair other than on the very tip of the weapon. Absolutely no recoil and basically unlimited ammo, this isn't a survival, this is just a camp-in-one-place-and-collect-health-and-a♥♥♥♥♥♥me. Gunplay is absolutely horrible and even if you aim down your sights, it's almost as bad as firing from the hip.\n-------------Gameplay-------------\nSingleplayer is exactly the same as Multiplayer - ONLY ONE PERSON ON. Yes, that's right! There's only one server on Multiplayer, and me and my friends went on it. We gave up after 20 mins. The radar and HUD is terrible, zombies make almost no noise (except when you shoot or kill them) and can hit you from a few metres away - and there's no way of knowing where you're getting hit from or if you're getting hit unless you're constantly staring at your health meter!\nOnline, the radar doesn't show your friends, and the chatbox tells you who's in the game because the dev couldn't be bothered to put a simple playerboard or leaderboard in. Instead they just got a bunch of assets off the unity store page.\nTip: If you want to make it through the 3 unity asset levels included in the game, just get yourself wedged between two zombies and walk backwards and jump.

There are no options to turn it down, the only option is to mute it or blew your eardrums listening to how loud it is.\nThe SFX is horrible. Zombie death sounds go on for way too long, gunshots are completely wrong, genuinely horrible sounds.\n-------------Gunplay-------------\nDue to the fact that your gun points to the center of the screen, there is no crosshair other than on the very tip of the weapon. Absolutely no recoil and basically unlimited ammo, this isn't a survival, this is just a camp-in-one-place-and-collect-health-and-a♥♥♥♥♥♥me. Gunplay is absolutely horrible and even if you aim down your sights, it's almost as bad as firing from the hip.\n-------------Gameplay-------------\nSingleplayer is exactly the same as Multiplayer - ONLY ONE PERSON ON. Yes, that's right! There's only one server on Multiplayer, and me and my friends went on it. We gave up after 20 mins. The radar and HUD is terrible, zombies make almost no noise (except when you shoot or kill them) and can hit you from a few metres away - and there's no way of knowing where you're getting hit from or if you're getting hit unless you're constantly staring at your health meter!\nOnline, the radar doesn't show your friends, and the chatbox tells you who's in the game because the dev couldn't be bothered to put a simple playerboard or leaderboard in. Instead they just got a bunch of assets off the unity store page.\nTip: If you want to make it through the 3 unity asset levels included in the game, just get yourself wedged between two zombies and walk backwards and jump. You fly into the air and land on the roof (if you want to).

I found out about it when googleing the worst game on steam. I played the game for 30 minnuts and I experienced the whole game in that time. The game has terrible wepons with the shot gun being a one shot kill weapon that had the rang of a sniper rifle and spread of a reguler shot gun. I quickly leared that this was the oly gun you should use cause of its over poweredness. Then the other class, the guy with the ak 47 and FAMAS. the ak and FAMAS were terrible weapons that ran out of ammo quickly and had terrible iron sights and aiming. Most of the time I wouldent shoot from the guns prospective but instead the cross hear. And you may be thinking dosent the gun move when shot to look like being shot at the cross hair, Nope it just shoots sideways. Plus the famases iron sights have it so you cant even see. Next on to the graphics, they look like crap. They look like they were taken out of google imiges espeshily the blood. it looks as convincing as ketchup. And then the enimys they were generic. For example the verity were zombies,demons, zombie kids, barraka from mortal kombat, and jack the killer.

The game has a good idea and start it is a little fun but it needs some work, i hope the developers fix some of these problems and i will continue to play the game and find things to let them, know about.

Now it is the second worst game I have ever played. This game supports 64 player multiplayer, but the problem is that NOBODY is playing it. So it is basically a single player game. Imagine an arena-style horde mode game like Killing Floor, but then take away everthing that made that game good and that's what you will end up with.  There are no redeeming factors. Poor enemy AI, an ugly HUD not even fit for a mobile game, horrendous gunplay, guns lack recoil, and just don't feel satisfying in any way. It has one music track, which doesn't suit the atmosphere, and it gets old quickly. It is basicly a few notes that play for 30 seconds on a permanent loop. Playing this game made me lose respect in Valve/Steam service itself, for the lack of quality control. Not even worth the $0.14 cents I paid for it. Not even for free. It is that bad.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P15yHelL2m4&index=16&list=PLNCk-m24qgLkgLn0G_PjSKus4gRPcU69J","December 11, 2015","false","0.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I found out about it when googleing the worst game on steam. I played the game for 30 minnuts and I experienced the whole game in that time. The game has terrible wepons with the shot gun being a one shot kill weapon that had the rang of a sniper rifle and spread of a reguler shot gun. I quickly leared that this was the oly gun you should use cause of its over poweredness. Then the other class, the guy with the ak 47 and FAMAS. the ak and FAMAS were terrible weapons that ran out of ammo quickly and had terrible iron sights and aiming. Most of the time I wouldent shoot from the guns prospective but instead the cross hear. And you may be thinking dosent the gun move when shot to look like being shot at the cross hair, Nope it just shoots sideways. Plus the famases iron sights have it so you cant even see. Next on to the graphics, they look like crap. They look like they were taken out of google imiges espeshily the blood. it looks as convincing as ketchup. And then the enimys they were generic. For example the verity were zombies,demons, zombie kids, barraka from mortal kombat, and jack the killer. But last should you buy the game. for 19 cents I would at least try it you could have naby 30 minnuts of fun cause of how bad it was like I did.","June 13, 2015","false","1.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I really feel that this game is one of the worst I've played. I paid 19 cents for it and made 2 cents profit by selling the cards, but I still feel ripped off. If you want to run around just to shoot the heads off of zombies, there are many, many other games out there that you should try instead. This game almost makes Bad Rats look decent.\nThe Slaughtering Grounds is surprisingly ugly and immemorable. I thought that it was my crap computer that caused it to lag and be so low quality, but it turns out that people with monster PCs still can't play this game at a tolerable framerate. The characters are terribly two dimensional and unappealing, almost as horribly made as the zombies. There is no story or purpose to the game other than to kill things and collect ammo. The game itself is in no way attractive or fun to play.\n\n+ Trading cards might be worth it if the game is on sale. Might.\n\n- Horrible framerate and boring appearance\n- Stolen images. Bruh\n- Zombie AIs are bad; randomly stopping, no movement, running in circles\n- Zombies are super slow and follow a simple path when they actually do work, making them easy to keep away from as they follow you endlessly.\n- Killing zombies is too easy, at least in the time that I played. I couldn't even play long enough to see if it got harder.\n- When they die, they explode with blood and their head severs. It doesn't look good.\n- Guns don't seem to line up with the crosshair and the recoil is disappointing. The guns don't feel right.\n- The default character, Snake, made me want to hit myself in the face, the other two are generic zombie apocalypse characters, Bob or something and no-name.\n- Music is irritating\n\nThis game has a reputation for a reason. Even if you got this game on sale for $0.19, it still probably isn't worth it. Save that $0.19 on another cheap game that isn't as horrid.","July 1, 2015","false","3.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The Slaughtering Grounds reminded me how bad some games can be. From the pixelated "Cash:" at the main menu, the totally out of place metal pattern for the borders surrounding the text to the blood effects that were taken straight from Google Images.\n\nIn the game you start off by shooting zombies which is pretty cool but after a few shots you run out of ammo. Even though all the ammo boxes show bullets on the boxes, it seems to give ammo only to the shotgun? Sometimes it doesnt even give you ammo but the ammo box disappears? I just suppose this is one of the many flaws and bugs in the game. When you are walking around and you get hit you don't even notice it most of the time as there is no sound or effect when you get hit. You only start noticing when the blood shows up on your screen or if you die. When you respawn you ofcourse lose all your ammo which feels just like getting shanked in your left asscheek. The money counts up too slow so it takes ages to get enough to buy a new character.\n\nI do however enjoy the fact you can one-shot zombies with a shotgun as in a lot of other games it takes multiple shots. As I use a French keyboard I have to set my "walk north" to 'Z' and my "walk west" to 'Q'. Even though I change these settings at the start up "ui Configuration"-window (doesn't even show a logo or mention the name of the game in the window), they never seem to get applied so I have to actually change the layout of the keyboard in my Windows settings. The game also gets incredibly boring fast as there is just one map (I think?).\n\nTo summarize;\nPros:\nYou can one-shot zombies with a shotgun\nCons:\nMany graphics (and concept artwork) are literally stolen without giving credit\nAfter listening for 5 minutes to the soundtrack it makes you wonder if life would be better in a padded cell in an insane asylum\nMessy controls that you cant even set up\nSounds effects are missing where there should be and the ones that are used often seem wrong for their purpose\nEven at 0.99$ this game still seems like a rip-off","July 7, 2015","false","0.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Stoneth/recommended/329950/","Stoneth","Stoneth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Stoneth/","1103 products in account","I am hesitant to call The Slaughtering Grounds a game. It feels more akin to a programming student's first project in Unity, so I feel less like I am critiquing a game and more like I am grading a homework assignment. That being said, The Slaughtering Grounds is a survival horror zombie based first person shooter ... in theory. It follows the trend put forth by games like Left 4 Dead and Killing Floor. In fact from the title and the gameplay choices made by the developer, I am fairly certain this game IS in fact intended to be a copy of Killing Floor.\n\nLike Killing Floor, The Slaughtering Ground features multiple classes with different weapons ... that is to say three classes with two weapons. And there is a wide variety of zombies to kill ... and by that I mean despite the motley crew of zombies (like police officers, prisoners, girl scouts, and hulking luchadors among others) they all fight the same way. As you fight your way through the one of two stages (that repeat), you'll notice that there's no indicator that you're being damaged apart from the spilled strawberry jam on your screen and your health slowly being eaten away. Because your character does not cry out in pain or the screen indicate when you are being wounded, you could have the Nemesis-like zombie chewing your arm off from behind and the only way you'd notice is if you look at your health bar going down and realize, "Huh, it looks like something is attacking me."\n\nThe weapon system is one of the worst I've seen in such a game. Your character will have two guns plus landmines and trip mines. You do not get a melee weapon which goes against survival horror design philosophy and doesn't help that ammunition can be hard to come across at first. The goal of the level is to survive until the time is up, but death has no consequence on your progress. If you die, you retain anything you had when you died and the time continues to go down. Also unlike other zombie games, zombies do not always actively look for you. In fact many just stand around in one place waiting for you to get close to them.\n\nOne of the biggest issues from a technical standpoint is the slowdown of the game. For whatever reason, the first level does not optimally play. Even if you have a top of the line computer, the horrendous framerate of the first stage will make you feel like you're running Battlefield 4 on a Pentium II. Strangely enough the other stage (and the repeat of the first stage) do not have this issue. And one of the biggest issues from an aesthetic standpoint is the music. There is only one song in the game and it has a short loop length and doesn't really fit with the game's theme. My advice if you plan on playing this game is to turn the music off from the game menu and put on some music of your choice, preferably some heavy metal, death metal or ABBA.\n\nThe game does offer SOME enjoyment however. Mostly this comes in the form of zombie corpses which twitch and move around in unnatural ways after they die. The first time you kick the berserker zombie's corpse clear across the stage is sure to get a laugh. And you can run right through treees and glass windows without breaking them or taking damage. But ... if you want to play an excellent class based multiplayer zombie first person shooter, I highly recommend you play Killing Floor instead.","May 24, 2015","false","2.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

If the developer was paying me to play this game, I would still be asking for my money back. If you have absolutely nothing else to do, then yes, spend the few cents this game costs right now during the summer sale, you will regret it but do it.\n\nAlright, next the game allows you to turn off the music, thank god because it was poorly designed... so you go to the multiplayer screen and guess what? The infernal ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ music is back, and it comes back almost as often as the developer does to produce games in 2 months and release them. It is actually disgusting how terrible and unfitting the music is.\n\nNext we go to the animations and textures - sure the gun shoots, the zombies kind of move/walk/levitate across the floor (all of this on the highest settings). I also managed to run up some stairs, jump onto part of the roof and fall through it into the building, no glass smashing noises, just standard fall it, doesn't matter, the roof is an illusion. The textures and such are the most terrible I have ever seen.\n\nDo not get me started on the wide array of guns and weapons at the start of the game. 'Pick between pistol or shotgun' - get both either way... floating ugly ammo boxes to restock.\n\nNow for the quick list of good things about this game - Steam has released it on sale (altough that £0.15 should be £0.00 or £0.01). Second good thing, it actually turns on. End of list of good things.\n\nThe developer is churning out unfinished, unpolished games in an attempt to make money, and will accuse people of slander or lies because of what they say, as well as resorting to banning accounts from forums and discussion due to any criticism. Apparently it is rude to say that the game was indeed poorly begun (cannot say made as it would refer to it as something beyond pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-early alpha.\n\nWaste of time and money.","June 17, 2015","false","0.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Mechanically, it's quite in shambles. So? I read in the description that it has nuts blood and physics... for laughs. This means that if you're looking for a serious, beautiful game, stay away. Personally, I'm digging it. There are one or two fatal flaws I noticed which, if fixed, would make this my go to silly game.\n\nFPS suuuuuuucks. Perhaps its the physics being ramped up, perhaps its the engine being utilized (looked the same as starforge, which also had/has similar issues/ hatred abounding) Fix my FPS to a stable 60, hell... 30, and that resolves the major grief.\n\nThe spawn situation: enough ammo to start, random spawn. OK, great, but I died with 0 ammo... respawned next to 2 big Zs with 0 ammo again? sometimes swithing weps a few times aused ammo to magially appear. Another reviewer says disabling gui gives infinite... that is a falsehood. As a fan of this game, here's what I'd like to see... respawn with the starting amount of ammo, every time. But I had 130 rds of SG ammo when I died... when you die, drop a crate with your stuff in it. And even better, TAC insertion ie. you pick where to spawn. I fancy a certain roof cuz there is ammo nearby... let me choose to spawn there.\n\nQuestion: what the hell is "the zombies are frenzied" even supposed to mean? It got dark and laggy, but that was all I noticed.\n\nI do like that you an outrun the Zs, which is the best strategy at first. Run to a building with visible stairs, climb the stairs, kill Zs close by the roof or balcony, then you're basically set.\n\nI also like that you an move through windows. Please don't "fix" that. Zombies can also move through fences. Don't "fix" that cuz beggars can't be choosers. I once got knocked waaaay up into the sky (got a screencap) and did not die on landing. I jumped off a 2 story balcony and took 2% dmg. (silly, not important)\n\nThe airdrop is pretty cool, despite being hard to find/ follow. If you do find it, its a ton of things.\n\nBig piles of cash are worth a lot less than small piles... sure, why not.\n\nIn closing, this game is still kinda bad. If they fix the FPS issue, it will be kinda good. Fix spawn too and it will be good. Do not buy this if you are someone who bit ches at glitches. If you enjoy games with some wacky elements (physics "glitches" and boundary breaking, etc) then for ~$4, you're not getting screwed.\n\nOh yeah, MP runs worse, but give me an option to host my own Dedi server, and I'll not complain.

This game is really really bad. I really can't think of anything positive to say about it. For starters, being poorly optimized is an understatement. My PC can handle anything out right now and yet on the highest setting I'm getting 10 to 25 FPS. You start with 2 guns with very limited ammo scattered randomly throughout the level. You can't tell when you get hit. There is virtually no hit direction. The graphics are blend, flat and something out of a PS1 era with low standards. Not even good PS1 graphics. I paid 19 cents for this and I still feel like I got cheated out of my money. If you get this game, do it for the cards, if not, stay away.

I've played bad games. I've played Ride to Hell. I've played Desert Bus. I've played E.T on Atari. I've been in a gas station restroom, where the last ten guys forgot to flush. Nothing, i mean NOTHING comes clost to THIS. My god, this game is bad on so many levels that, not only am I surprised its still on steam, I'm surprised its legal to purchase this game. Perhaps I'm overreacting. Let's analyze (tear apart) this game (monstroity, abomination of human creation, etc.)\n\nGraphics:\nSurprisingly one of the best things about this game. That doesn't mean much. Most indie games look like they should run on an Xbox 360, but not a PS3. Some indie games look like they should run on Xbox or PS2. Some indie games purpousefully look like they should run on a Super Nintendo. It's hard to describe how this game looks. Let's look at a game called Doom. It came out early 90s, and revolutionized gaming. It had great level design, replayabillity, and overall, it was fun. The only thing about Doom that hasn't aged well is the graphics. you can make things out, but not from a distance. Fast forward twenty years. The Slaughtering grounds makes Doom look like Black Ops 3. One might say, "at least Slaughtering Grounds is in 3D!" That is exactly the problem. You can't tell what is what. I can't put into words how all of the original graphics look. Keyword: original. lots of content in this game was stolen. the blood splatter on the screen, buildings, and overly likely the zombies themselves have been stolen from game maker programs or other games. That sinks to a whole new low on the developers' part.\n\nGameplay:\nA typical Slaughtering Grounds game looks like this: you spawn, you look around, you shoot things for six seconds, you die intantly without warning. Repeat. There are lots and lots wrong with this game's "gameplay". First off, whenever you spawn, and I mean EVERY TIME you spawn, you spawn with less than full health. Let me repeat that. You spawn with LESS THAN FULL HEALTH. This ranges from spawning with 85-95% health to spawning with as low as 30% health. What. The. Hell. Any reason? Nope. Let's move on. When you start the game (When it boots up it shoves you straight into character selection, no title screen or anything), you look around in astonishment at how horrible this game looks. Then, you try and move around. You think that the art of being able to move your character was mastered in Wolfenstien 3D, but apparently some people have a long way to go. You bump into the smallest things like opaque (and non-opaque) bushes and indescribable objects that try to look like part of the scenery but just sit there looking silly. Then, when you try to walk through buildings and barrels and shelves, you clip through them. It gets rediculous. The only class you have unlocked has two weapons, a revolver and a shotgun. You spend a while shooting zombies, and then you run out of ammo. Now what? well you die, because there is no melee attack or way to defend yourself except running in circles. After doing this for ten minutes, you find out there IS ammo you can pick up, but: a. The ammo packs are in buildings you won't bother to go in and b. they are floating in midair. I might add that, when you pick up ammo or get hit, there is no audio/visual feedback telling you what is happening. It's not like Borderlands, where when you pick up ammo it has text display and a sound que play telling uou that you did so. when you get hit, there is no feedback or player callouts saying that you are in danger. The only way to keep track of your stats is to look at the world's crappiest HUD that barely gives any reaction. By the way, when you want to get more ammo, you have to have the weapon out you need ammo for. This means if you have no shotgun ammo and want some, you have to swap weapons to the one that can't do jack and run around like a ♥♥♥♥♥ to find an ammo pack. After twenty minutes, you realize this is it. No skill trees, no story mode, nothing to do except shoot more zombies. They managed to make zombie survival, an intense genre, boring. Bravo.\n\nPlot:\nThis game has less plot than Super Mario Bros. This game has less plot than Slender, a game in which the entire plot is three words: collect seven pages (Anything not in the game I don't consider to be the game's plot, just extra stuff. Sorry, TF2.). This game has less plot than TETRIS. I might go the length to say this game has no plot. Atually it does. The plot is: You are some generic idea that has been done a million times and you go kill zombies now. Truly a work of art. It will go in the hall of fame of best game stories ever. I can see its trophy on the shelf, right between Bioshock and Chrono Trigger.\n\nCharacters:\nTwo words: Generic and Uninspired. The character you unlock at the beginning, a fat guy who looks like he got all dressed up to go to Gun-crazy Redneck Awards 2016 who is, for some reason, happy to see the apocolypse so he can unleash his sick, twisted, criminally insane idea to take out a shotgun and blast everything into Oblivion. Our second of three characters is a millitary guy. Not much to say. Just imagine every NPC soldier in Call of Duty, Battlefield, Halo, Arma, etc. etc. etc. You play as that guy. Our last character is an ex-cop (where have I heard that before?) from the LAPD (where have I heard that before?) who magically gets a bunch of guns to kill zombies with. Surprisingly, the cop has the worst loadout in the game, in which you'd think he had the best. Whatever, it's not like you're going to care when these guys die anyways. You'll just respawn instantly.\n\nReplayabillity:\nMost games today have over twenty hours of content, spanning great explorable environments and having lots to do. How long does this take to get boring? A whole five minutes. After that, you will realize you wasted your money and go play something better, like any other game ever.\n\nOverall:\nHow I do my overall score is I grade each aspect already discussed and an extra one mattering on the type of game I'm playing (for example, if I was doing a platformer I'd put level design, or if I was doing a racing game I'd do difficulty balance). I also add an extra bonus grade for how much the community liked the grade. Then, I give a final score and price comparison.\nHere's my letter grades between A+ and F- on all aspects of the game:\n\nGraphics: D\nGameplay: F+\nPlot: F\nCharacters: D+\nReplayabillity: D\n(Extra) Horror: C-\nBonus Points: F-\n\nRetail Price: $1\nSuggested Price: Free\n\nFINAL SCORE: F\n\nLast thoughts:\nI haven't even mentioned how the developers are colossal jerks, beleiving that this game is "art" and shouldn't be criticized, but I don't need to comment about this.

Couldn't care less about the revolver). I played enough time (most of it in multiplayer, which had some people playing at the time, much to my surprise) to unlock a second character, a military guy with two assault rifles. Both of the weapons the unlockable character has, are way worse than the shotgun. They are less accurate at range (any range), eat through ammo like crazy and take up most of the screen. Haven't tried the third and last character yet, but I'm not sure if I'll be bothered to play enough to unlock that one too.\n\nFrom what I've seen, there's a single map. That's it. One map. The map itself is okay-ish. The spawns are less then ideal, mostly because you spawn almost instantly after you've died and most spawns are surrounded by "zombies" that will charge at you the moment you're up.\n\nThe UI takes up way too much of the screen.

And, if I remember correctly, I heard the developer say that this is one of his first games and that he's improving his game developing skills, so why not buy this crap for 20 cents to support him and see if he can do better in the future?\n\nStill not sure if this is a yes or no for recommending, though.

This game is really really bad. I really can't think of anything positive to say about it. For starters, being poorly optimized is an understatement. My PC can handle anything out right now and yet on the highest setting I'm getting 10 to 25 FPS. You start with 2 guns with very limited ammo scattered randomly throughout the level. You can't tell when you get hit. There is virtually no hit direction. The graphics are blend, flat and something out of a PS1 era with low standards. Not even good PS1 graphics. I paid 19 cents for this and I still feel like I got cheated out of my money. If you get this game, do it for the cards, if not, stay away. And I thought Bad Rats was bad but at least it was more optimized then this piece of ♥♥♥♥ of a game. 0/10\n\nThis review describes this game and how the dev got butt-hurt about it.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WT0GSPxf0vw","July 11, 2015","false","3.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","2"

I've played bad games. I've played Ride to Hell. I've played Desert Bus. I've played E.T on Atari. I've been in a gas station restroom, where the last ten guys forgot to flush. Nothing, i mean NOTHING comes clost to THIS. My god, this game is bad on so many levels that, not only am I surprised its still on steam, I'm surprised its legal to purchase this game. Perhaps I'm overreacting. Let's analyze (tear apart) this game (monstroity, abomination of human creation, etc.)\n\nGraphics:\nSurprisingly one of the best things about this game. That doesn't mean much. Most indie games look like they should run on an Xbox 360, but not a PS3. Some indie games look like they should run on Xbox or PS2. Some indie games purpousefully look like they should run on a Super Nintendo. It's hard to describe how this game looks. Let's look at a game called Doom. It came out early 90s, and revolutionized gaming. It had great level design, replayabillity, and overall, it was fun. The only thing about Doom that hasn't aged well is the graphics. you can make things out, but not from a distance. Fast forward twenty years. The Slaughtering grounds makes Doom look like Black Ops 3. One might say, "at least Slaughtering Grounds is in 3D!" That is exactly the problem. You can't tell what is what. I can't put into words how all of the original graphics look. Keyword: original. lots of content in this game was stolen. the blood splatter on the screen, buildings, and overly likely the zombies themselves have been stolen from game maker programs or other games. That sinks to a whole new low on the developers' part.\n\nGameplay:\nA typical Slaughtering Grounds game looks like this: you spawn, you look around, you shoot things for six seconds, you die intantly without warning. Repeat. There are lots and lots wrong with this game's "gameplay". First off, whenever you spawn, and I mean EVERY TIME you spawn, you spawn with less than full health. Let me repeat that. You spawn with LESS THAN FULL HEALTH. This ranges from spawning with 85-95% health to spawning with as low as 30% health. What. The. Hell. Any reason? Nope. Let's move on. When you start the game (When it boots up it shoves you straight into character selection, no title screen or anything), you look around in astonishment at how horrible this game looks. Then, you try and move around. You think that the art of being able to move your character was mastered in Wolfenstien 3D, but apparently some people have a long way to go. You bump into the smallest things like opaque (and non-opaque) bushes and indescribable objects that try to look like part of the scenery but just sit there looking silly. Then, when you try to walk through buildings and barrels and shelves, you clip through them. It gets rediculous. The only class you have unlocked has two weapons, a revolver and a shotgun. You spend a while shooting zombies, and then you run out of ammo. Now what? well you die, because there is no melee attack or way to defend yourself except running in circles. After doing this for ten minutes, you find out there IS ammo you can pick up, but: a. The ammo packs are in buildings you won't bother to go in and b. they are floating in midair. I might add that, when you pick up ammo or get hit, there is no audio/visual feedback telling you what is happening. It's not like Borderlands, where when you pick up ammo it has text display and a sound que play telling uou that you did so. when you get hit, there is no feedback or player callouts saying that you are in danger. The only way to keep track of your stats is to look at the world's crappiest HUD that barely gives any reaction. By the way, when you want to get more ammo, you have to have the weapon out you need ammo for. This means if you have no shotgun ammo and want some, you have to swap weapons to the one that can't do jack and run around like a ♥♥♥♥♥ to find an ammo pack. After twenty minutes, you realize this is it. No skill trees, no story mode, nothing to do except shoot more zombies. They managed to make zombie survival, an intense genre, boring. Bravo.\n\nPlot:\nThis game has less plot than Super Mario Bros. This game has less plot than Slender, a game in which the entire plot is three words: collect seven pages (Anything not in the game I don't consider to be the game's plot, just extra stuff. Sorry, TF2.). This game has less plot than TETRIS. I might go the length to say this game has no plot. Atually it does. The plot is: You are some generic idea that has been done a million times and you go kill zombies now. Truly a work of art. It will go in the hall of fame of best game stories ever. I can see its trophy on the shelf, right between Bioshock and Chrono Trigger.\n\nCharacters:\nTwo words: Generic and Uninspired. The character you unlock at the beginning, a fat guy who looks like he got all dressed up to go to Gun-crazy Redneck Awards 2016 who is, for some reason, happy to see the apocolypse so he can unleash his sick, twisted, criminally insane idea to take out a shotgun and blast everything into Oblivion. Our second of three characters is a millitary guy. Not much to say. Just imagine every NPC soldier in Call of Duty, Battlefield, Halo, Arma, etc. etc. etc. You play as that guy. Our last character is an ex-cop (where have I heard that before?) from the LAPD (where have I heard that before?) who magically gets a bunch of guns to kill zombies with. Surprisingly, the cop has the worst loadout in the game, in which you'd think he had the best. Whatever, it's not like you're going to care when these guys die anyways. You'll just respawn instantly.\n\nReplayabillity:\nMost games today have over twenty hours of content, spanning great explorable environments and having lots to do. How long does this take to get boring? A whole five minutes. After that, you will realize you wasted your money and go play something better, like any other game ever.\n\nOverall:\nHow I do my overall score is I grade each aspect already discussed and an extra one mattering on the type of game I'm playing (for example, if I was doing a platformer I'd put level design, or if I was doing a racing game I'd do difficulty balance). I also add an extra bonus grade for how much the community liked the grade. Then, I give a final score and price comparison.\nHere's my letter grades between A+ and F- on all aspects of the game:\n\nGraphics: D\nGameplay: F+\nPlot: F\nCharacters: D+\nReplayabillity: D\n(Extra) Horror: C-\nBonus Points: F-\n\nRetail Price: $1\nSuggested Price: Free\n\nFINAL SCORE: F\n\nLast thoughts:\nI haven't even mentioned how the developers are colossal jerks, beleiving that this game is "art" and shouldn't be criticized, but I don't need to comment about this.

Sorry, I meant to say, most "hardcore".  Isn't that the trendy term for a game which is so preposterously difficult that it can only be played by people who are either insanely naturally talented and/or completely lacking in anything resembling a "life"?\n\nTo wit: You start with a choice of only one character, and two guns.  And the guns AREN'T automatic rifles.  And the zombies run REALLY fast, making head-shots a significant challenge.  And did I mention there's about SEVEN BILLION zombies on the first map, only six rounds of ammo in your revolver, and almost NO spare ammo lying about?  It looks like you can buy new characters and better guns as you earn in-game "money", but I can't imagine what kind of socially-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ psychopath would have the patience required to get that far.\n\nHell, I'll even save the kind of person I just mentioned the trouble of a purchase, with a quick "simulation" of the game (I pride myself on nothing if not being interactive).  Imagine a deep, male American voice, turned up way too loud in the mix, and close your eyes:\n\n"GAME OVER.  GAME OVER.  GAME OVER.  GAME OVER.  GAME OVER."\n\nThere you go, you've now played the game five times.  Time to move on with your life, methinks.\n\nVerdict:  2.5/10.","April 2","false","0.6"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","6","8","2","2"

EVERY other game, even bad games, look great in comparison to this.  So to truly appreciate any other game of your choice, simply compare it to "this" one.\n\nIf this game was "poop" then it would most definitely plug up any toilet.  It's truly god awful and not even funny as a joke or prank it's so horrible.  Don't even send this POS to your worst enemy, it really IS that bad... It would be more humane to wish cancer upon your worst enemy then to send them this toxic crap as a gift.\n\nI had to force myself to be generous to give this game a 4% score but as a complete score, it deserves a NEGATIVE (Below 0) score.   I think this is the worst game I've ever played in my life.. At least the horrid ET game on the Atari 2600 didn't make me sick at my stomach and wonder if God was real because if God was real, He would never allow something this toxic and bad to be created by His creation in humanity.\n\nI'm not trying to be funny or witty is the sad thing.  This game is virtual toxic waste that should be disposed of forever.\n\nAvoid at all costs.  Stay far, far away and call the police on anyone who dares send this poison to you as a gift.","November 28, 2015","false","0.4"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","7","10","2","0"

Thankfully, you can turn it off.\n- I'm not so sure that the radar works correctly. At the very least, I can't tell where I am on it. The center? Whatever. It's unnecessary, and again, you can turn it off. (Edit: The center dot that shows where I am just didn't load. Worked when I restarted.)\n- There's no sound when you are taking damage. Just being near the zombies seems to damage you, and your health disappears very quickly.\n-There's a blood effect that appears around the edge of the screen when you take damage that doesn't seem to go away. Wouldn't mind so much if it didn't take up half the screen. If you're playing with the GUI and radar on, and this effect starts, you'll be pretty much blind.\n- Item pickups are huge, but are still difficult to pickup for some reason.\n- There's one music loop that plays constantly while the game is running. It's really out of place. You can turn it off though.\n-On the whole, I don't really have any idea what the hell I'm supposed to be doing. I shoot zombies, run out of ammo pretty much immediately, and then spend the rest of the time searching for ammo and respawning.\n-Fun fact: When you die, just keep pressing the spacebar to ascend to heaven!\n\nThere's a lot more than that, but I don't want to spend more time writing the review than I did playing the game.\n\nI wouldn't recommend buying this for yourself.

No effort, except to steal certain work from other developers.  Every single card sold nets them at least a penny.

It was just me; no one to share the pain or anyone else to exchange my deepest feelings with. Not only was I very much alone, but I was also surrounded by tons of reanimated corpses, or zombies.\n\nNow, dear reader, you are probably wondering: what am I doing in a place like this? Was it something I did? Was it because I had ignored the never-ending argument between my friends over half-understand concepts of politics? Yep, it was probably the latter reason.\n\nHere, is how I got into this mess:\nMy boredom had reached dangerously low levels and I had to do something about it.  There was this game called The Slaughtering Grounds, which was a hideously generic first-person shooter where you GOTTA SHOOT DA ZOMBIEZ, CUZ WHEN YA SEE DA ZOMBIEZ YA GOTTA KILL THEM, END OF STORY. I thought to myself: why must I shoot the zombies? Why do they have to be portrayed this way? Why must we always make the assumption that we must end their un-life whenever we see them?\n\nAt the very beginning of the game, I was given two weapons to start off with: a revolver and a shotgun. Both of them did excellent at close-range combat, killing my undead enemies in one or two shots. Echoing across dimensions, there was this AWFUL soundtrack that looped infinitely and seemed to burrow into your ears after the first two times of listening to it. After I had killed three zombies, my ammo was running low. I sighted a floating container not far from my current location, so I sprinted towards it. I was somewhat relieved to see the ammo counter on my revolver fill back up, but when I switched to my shotgun, I realised with horror that the ammo crate I picked up earlier only contributed to the WEAPON CURRENTLY EQUIPPED, NOT OTHER WEAPONS.\n“♥♥♥♥.” I muttered aloud. Yes, that means that my revolver was the only recipient for the ammo crate, which means I had to find ANOTHER ammo crate in order to fill up my shotgun. After I had successfully replenished all my ammo stores (yes, I had to individually locate several crates in different locations which was a chore to do), I was ready to handle this abomination of a game.\n\nSince the zombie types were anything but varied and were fairly easy to take down, I was given the chance to observe the map I was playing on. The literal ground where all this slaughtering took place was void of any detail and so static I could almost hear the white noise in my head. Nothing really changed when the timer finished. I simply got teleported to another location where I could do the same thing. Rinse and repeat.\n\nHell, it didn’t even allow melee combat. Not a knife, not a sword, not ANYTHING. Not even the BUTT OF YOUR GUN, because you’re gonna need that to BASH YOURSELF IN THE HEAD LATER, FOR PLAYING THIS COMPLETE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥IZATION OF KILLING FLOOR.\n\nKilling Floor? What’s that? I’ll tell you what it is: it’s what The Slaughtering Grounds is based off of. Hell, the latter game’s title is practically the former game’s except they reworded it. Killing Floor. Slaughtering Grounds. And now, The Butchering Lands, which is my own work. Frankly, Killing Floor is a hell of a lot better than Slaughtering Grounds in every single aspect. Even the single player of Killing Floor is WAY more interesting.\n\nStory wise, Slaughtering Grounds has none. Just simply dumps you into an arena and shoot zombies, because narrative takes too much EFFORT. There is only a small character description when you choose who you want to play as, and believe me; all of those characters have a back story that makes a ♥♥♥♥ing WALL look like ROALD DAHL. Cripes, I could stare into the cloudy depths of my coffee and I could get more inspiration from it than I did with this game made by tiny-baby developers who haven’t a clue what originality is.\n\nIf this is not enough to prevent you from purchasing this game, let me tell you this: the developers of Slaughtering Grounds aren’t any better than their product. When a certain game journalist named Jim Sterling reviewed the game and dubbed it “an absolute failure”, the tiny-baby developers threw a tiny-baby hissy fit and flipped out. They called Jim a “♥♥♥♥ing idiot” and claimed his criticism was harming their copyright.\n…really? Well, you can read about the whole mess in the link listed below:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6s0Wpn1zmU\n\nAnyway, for your sake and for your wallet’s sake (the game is on sale for barely a dollar, there are more worthy games at that price), buy something else.\nOh, and by the way, since I am the one who bought this game, I shall create a story that basically sums up this encounter:\nMy name is Dr. M and I have succeeded in failing the human race. I tried to build the perfect human, but have only accomplished in wasting money, time and recourses. Now, it is my duty to destroy that which I have created. This is my ultimate fate. No one else is to be involved in this. No more lives need to be harmed; I wish to be the only one whose life will be lost amidst this travesty.\nFarewell, I wish you a good life and may you find better indie games out there.\n---Dr. M\n","January 25","false","3.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Do not buy it,  not even to try it for yourself,  it isn't worth spending even a cent on.\n\nAs for why?\n\nWell, ignoring all the drama behind this game,  you basically have a very simple shooter.   Since your character starts with the best gun in game already (The shotgun)  there is zero incentive to try to advance.  Advancement,  is simply gathering cash from killed enemies,  (all of whom die in one hit, from the shotgun).\n\nOnce you find a place that has more ammo spawns, than zombies,  that's pretty much it.   No reason to get more cash,  and at 15 minutes the game switches levels,  no boss, no mini-boss, no story.  So nio reason to really advance, or do anything.\n\nThis is one of the worst games I've ever played.  It deserves all the ire it has gotten,  and that the dev would take pride in such work is beyond me.

Do not buy it,  not even to try it for yourself,  it isn't worth spending even a cent on.\n\nAs for why?\n\nWell, ignoring all the drama behind this game,  you basically have a very simple shooter.   Since your character starts with the best gun in game already (The shotgun)  there is zero incentive to try to advance.  Advancement,  is simply gathering cash from killed enemies,  (all of whom die in one hit, from the shotgun).\n\nOnce you find a place that has more ammo spawns, than zombies,  that's pretty much it.   No reason to get more cash,  and at 15 minutes the game switches levels,  no boss, no mini-boss, no story.  So nio reason to really advance, or do anything.\n\nThis is one of the worst games I've ever played.  It deserves all the ire it has gotten,  and that the dev would take pride in such work is beyond me.   Just remove this from steam.","December 3, 2015","false","0.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There really isn't much to say about this one. Poor combat mechanics paired with awful AI a drolling soundtrack of the same 5 seconds of a song looped over and over again. And you've got yourself prepped for just about any of the Digital Homicide Studio's games. But this one in particular is probably one of the worst offenders being somewhere above temper tantrum but below Forsaken Uprising. In short everything about this game is awful and it's honestly not even worth the 14 cents on sale much less so the 99 cent original asking price. So get this game with caution as it is essentially a visual lobotomy. Unless you wan't to laugh at this with friends donate your 14 cents towards something good like raising money for animal shelters. 1/10 Absolute ♥♥♥♥♥.

Sometimes I win in a few minutes sometimes I wait over half an hour and the narrator just ends up saying "Fantastic" twelve times before cutting himself off with a "Try again". There is no limit to the amount of times you can die so you could technically play this  "game" forever. Don't do that though.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/meme-lord/recommended/329950/","meme-lord","club penguin ageplay fanfic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/meme-lord/","312 products in account","Summary\n\nTen years have passed since the fall of Durkadurkadom, and the American hero Snake still has not returned to his kingdom in New Jersey. A large and rowdy mob of zombies who have overrun Snake’s palace and pillaged his land continue to court his wife, Britany. She has remained faithful to Snake. The young bro Bruno, Snake’s son, wants desperately to throw them out but does not have the confidence or experience to fight them. One of the zombies, Brad, plans to assassinate the young bro, eliminating the only opposition to their dominion over the palace.\n\nUnknown to the zombies, Snake is still alive. The beautiful Shaniqua, possessed by love for him, has imprisoned him on her island, Long Beach. He longs to return to his wife and son, but he has no ship or crew to help him escape. While the gods and goddesses of Trenton debate Snake’s future, Michelle, Snake’s strongest supporter among the gods, resolves to help Bruno. Disguised as a friend of the bro’s grandfather, Vinny, she convinces the prince to call a meeting of the assembly at which he reproaches the zombies. Michelle also prepares him for a great journey to Jackson and Howell, where the kings Eddy and Stan, Snake’s companions during the war, inform him that Snake is alive and trapped on Shaniqua’s island. Bruno makes plans to return home, while, back in New Jersey, Brad and the other zombies prepare an ambush to kill him when he reaches port.\n\nAt Trenton, Obama sends Joe Biden to rescue Snake from Shaniqua. Joe Biden persuades Shaniqua to let Snake build a ship and leave. The homesick hero sets sail, but when Mitt Romney, god of the sea, finds him sailing home, he sends a storm to wreck Snake’s ship. Mitt Romney has harbored a bitter grudge against Snake since the hero blinded his chum, Santorum, earlier in his travels. Michelle intervenes to save Snake from Mitt Romney’s wrath, and the beleaguered king lands at Brosia, home of the Brosians. Broseff, the Brosian princess, shows him to the royal palace, and Snake receives a warm welcome from the king and queen. When he identifies himself as Snake, his hosts, who have heard of his exploits at Durkadurkadom, are stunned. They promise to give him safe passage to New Jersey, but first they beg to hear the story of his adventures.\n\nSnake spends the night describing the fantastic chain of events leading up to his arrival on Shaniqua’s island. He recounts his trip to the Land of the Planet Fitness, his battle with Santorum, his love affair with the witch-goddess Sarah Palin, his temptation by the deadly ratchet ♥♥♥ hoes, and his fight with the sea monster Snooki. When he finishes his story, the Brosians return Snake to New Jersey, where he seeks out the hut of his faithful swineherd, Jake. Though Michelle has disguised Snake as a beggar, Jake warmly receives and nourishes him in the hut. He soon encounters Bruno, who has returned from Jackson and Howell despite the zombies’ ambush, and reveals to him his true identity. Snake and Bruno devise a plan to massacre the zombies and regain control of New Jersey.\n\nWhen Snake arrives at the palace the next day, still disguised as a beggar, he endures abuse and insults from the zombies. The only person who recognizes him is his old nurse, Sammi, but she swears not to disclose his secret. Britany takes an interest in this strange beggar, suspecting that he might be her long-lost husband. Quite crafty herself, Britany organizes an archery contest the following day and promises to marry any man who can string Snake’s great bow and fire an arrow through a row of twelve axes—a feat that only Snake has ever been able to accomplish. At the contest, each zombie tries to string the bow and fails. Snake steps up to the bow and, with little effort, fires an arrow through all twelve axes. He then turns the bow on the zombies. He and Bruno, assisted by a few faithful servants, kill every last zombie.\n\nSnake reveals himself to the entire palace and reunites with his loving Britany. He travels to the outskirts of New Jersey to see his aging father, Jionni. They come under attack from the vengeful family members of the dead zombies, but Jionni, reinvigorated by his son’s return, successfully kills Brad’s father and puts a stop to the attack. Obama dispatches Michelle to restore peace. With his power secure and his family reunited, Snake’s long ordeal comes to an end.\n\nThere you go. I just told you the entire story you dont have to buy the game.","November 29, 2014","false","4.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","5"

Do not look back. You might say...well its only $0.14 how bad could it be? Pretty damn bad. On the other hand, if you are looking for a hilariously bad game to laugh at with your friends or a perfect gag gift then look no further!\n\nSo what exactly is so terribly bad about it? Well, the game play, originality, graphics, music, and glitches. So, pretty much everything. I noticed at one point my total kill counter maxed out at 299, so obviously the devlopers didn't even intend for someone to actually play this game for very long. Some other highlights include getting randomly launched in the air, jumping on some railings and getting stuck, and falling through a giant propane tank,  and getting "killed" with -2 health and the voice saying I lose or whatver, but not actually dying and  respawning. I lasted like that till the time went out and progressed to the next map. There is no story, plot or really any main objective. There are (I think) 3 maps, but they all look similiar. You get to the next map by lasting 16 minutes. There is no penalty for dying...your timer doesn't even restart, so you can just sit there and dying over and over again. The only good thing about this game is it does have steam cards, so atleast I made the $0.14 back and then a bit extra.","September 12, 2015","false","3.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

This game has so many bugs and glitches I could have made a better game while taking a sh*t on my iphone. The game's graphics look like a game from 2000 not from 2014. There is not 1 unique thing this game brings to the table. u can complete the game in 45 mins because u spend 15 mins on each map and there are only 3 maps. If  u r wondering "Why 15 mins" Its because the levels are timed and if u think tht if it has a timer u need to survive tht amount of time then u r WRONG! If u die the timer continue so there's basically no point of the timer, so tht means tht there is no way to lose at this game. Tht means tht I can only reccomend this to are for people tht havn't beaten one video game in their life so tht they can say "Hey. I beat the Slaughtering Grounds" But then ur friends will just feel sorry for u. The maps seem like the same thing they have the same buildings around the maps so the only the thing tht changes is the scenary or the time of day. There is ammo around the map and u need to be holding the gun u want ammo for because the devs rushed this game out with no anticipation from people so there is noo need to rush out an unanticipated game. When the game starts up it s at 60fps bu then immediately drops to 20. The best thing about this game is tht I can laugh at it as the game is so bad tht it's good similar to Day One: Garry's Incident but I would choose to play Day One: Garry's Incident over this any day.The music loops incesently it's a 10 second loop of 1 song so if u play this game (WHICH YOU SHOULDN'T!) you will be listening to tht same 10 second loop for 45 mins.A weird thing I noticed is tht on the 3rd map the POV seems to zoom in. It dosn't happen on the other maps only the last one. Another thing tht I noticed about this game is tht it seems to take things from other things. The zombies look like they were ripped ff from resident evil 2. The blood splatters are from google images and they didn't bother to remove the white texture behind them... Wait... Why would the blood stick to ur screen? Does the blood just stick to ur eyeballs when u shoot the zombies? ANSWER ME HOMICIDE STUDIOS AND THT IS WHT THIS STUDIO IS DOING TO ME I FEEL LIKE    THEY ARE STABBING ME EVERY 5 MINS WITH A KNIFE SO THEY CAN SLOWLY WHATCH ME BLEED TO DEATH FOR THEIR OWN PERSONAL ENJOYMENT WHILE THEY COUNT THE MOUNT OF MONEY THT THEY GOT FROM OVER 1000 PEOPLE EVERY ONE PAYING 79P FOR IT AND THIS GAME ISN'T WORTH THT EITHER! THE BAD THING IS I BOUGHT THE COLLECTION OF HOMICIDE STUDIO'S GAMES! THE COLLECTION WAS ON DEAL FOR 79P FROM THE USUAL £3.99 AND I THINK I WAS RIPPED OFF WITH 79P I WILL GO INTO MORE RANTS WITH THOSE GAMES!

I'm actually suprised that they could fit this many awesome game mechanics in just a tiny 380MB download!\n\nOne of these previously mentioned mechanics is invincible glass! Never worry about pesky zombie snipers again!\n\nIt also has a gambling mechanics - you have to make a gamble on whether an object has physics or not! Those trees? No physics! Good Job! Those giant fuel containers over there? You can walk straight through those beasts! Your prize? Knowing what NOT to attempt to parkour on!\n\nAnother amazing game defining mechanic is that no matter where you shoot zombies, their heads ALWAYS explode! Get that glorious headshot feeling no matter how bad you are at aiming!\n\nThese and many other absolutely fabulous mechanics are why I would reccomend this game to any person who asks. I even got it at a discounted price for only 15 cents!

It run's at stunning 12 fps for me which I feel is a bargain for 11p. It's incredibly easy to get into and learn about the game. It only took me 10 minutes to realise that I was dead and just floating around as a point of view.\n\nI would reccomend this game as one of the classics that you need to play before you die of wiggily bone syndrome and get shipped off to the great walk-in-crematorium in the sky along with Michale Jackson and the Cosby's.\n\n"I would kill a baby for this game."

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/smonkwede/recommended/329950/","smonkwede","чики брики","http://steamcommunity.com/id/smonkwede/","108 products in account","This game. Truly great.\n\nThis game is a shining example of what the Unity Engine is capable of.\nSome games like Kerbal Space Program or Subnautica make you really wonder what such an engine is capable of and make many think the engine is a joke. This game is great in every sense.\n\nFirst off it starts and you're greeted with an Avant garde minimalist menu. Is it practical? No, it's art.\nThe minimalist themes continue with the brilliant musical loop of 30 seconds, short and concise. As well, beyond a very minimalist desktop shortcut, there is no edited logo for when the game is running (seen in the taskbar.)\n\nNext is the gameplay, and this is the most hardcore survival game by far. There's so little ammo available on the map, you need to make sure that the 10 shotgun shells or 8 pistol rounds you get, at a time, are used wisely to diffuse the 10-20 zombies that often chase you and grow in numbers.\n\nAs 10-20 zombies chase you and you seek out ammo, and don't find it because the game is so hardcore, you’ll notice how huge the map is, not at all. Again the minimalism. Big maps are bad because it's easy to get lost. DigiHom gets this. This map is small and concise so you know where the ammo will not be. Brilliant design.\n\nAtmosphere is fantastic as well. The game is usually so dark it's almost impossible to see the zombies unless I increase the contrast of my monitor and fry my eyes. Amazingly dark and spooky, really adding to the whole run in circles chased by zombies only to almost never find ammo. Very emotionally representational of the feeling of hopelessness as would be brought on by a real apocalypse. Very deep, very esoteric.\n\nFinally, this game also has a very lively online community. One server with no one on. Again the deep emotional connection to a real zombie situation that makes you reflect on how alone you'd be in the real apocalypse. So you can run around on the same maps, with no ammo, being chased by dozens of AI around a small dark map, but now with no one to help you. Amazing!\n\nThis game is an Avant garde minimalist esoteric masterpiece.\nSolid 9/9 games on greenlight at one time.","November 23, 2015","true","4.2"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","50","6","12","12","0"

The Slaughtering Grounds is an unapologetic first grade zombie slaying simulator.\nThe main feature of the game is the massive viewmodels that obscure most of the screen. This makes the zombies harder to see and thus increases the difficulty.\n\nFurthermore this Dark Soulsesque game has no indications of damage meaning that you can never take your eyes off the health bar. With three unique characters to play with this game offers countless oppurtunities for replayability.\n\nLet's not forget the best part of the game, there is chance of the Diablo himself to appear and chase you around the map. The knowledge that this massive threat can appear at any given moment leads to a tense and scary feeling persisting thoughout the game.\n\nSo in short: a realistic first person viewmodel horror zombie based survival simulator.","November 15, 2015","true","1.0"," 11 of 23 people (48%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","48","11","23","9","2"

Don't understand the hate.\n\nHere is my review.\n\nStory -\n\n10/10\n\nBest story in a game becuase their is none. The developers took a smart move and said, "♥♥♥♥ the story," and added no story to the game. Instead, focused on more important stuff.\n\nFramerate/Graphics/Bugs\n\n10/10\n\nTo start out, there are absolutly no bugs in this game. This makes big companies like EA and Ubisoft look pathetic, this game is perfect. Moving onto graphics, this game makes Crysis 3 look like a potato. The graphics and visuals are absolutely stunning, perfect models, animations, textures, you name it. It comes with six very descriptive and well named graphics presets, starting out with\n\nFastest (For scrubs) Needs a GTX 960 ti\nFast (For potatoes) Needs a GTX 970 ti\nSimple (Ehh) Needs a GTX 980 ti\nGood (Good) Needs a GTX Titian X\nBeautiful (Perfect) Requires GeForce Titan X SuperClock Running in a six way SLI.\n\nDon't forget the framerate, runs perfectly no studdering whatsoever best game.\n\nGameplay -\n\n10/10\n\nYou spawn. You kill zombies. You die. You repeat.\n\nMultiplayer -\n\n10/10\n\nEvryone is so scrubby at the game no one plays it multiplayer if you do invite me i'll rekt you in 1v1\n\nAnd finnaly, who is this game for?\n\nThis game is for the person who,\n\nA. Is a connisur of game collects\nB. Is me\nC. Needs help considering suicide\nD. Wants to be apart of gaming history\n\nAlso this game is great with VR i got it working i will not tell you how.\n\nDo buy this game.","April 1","true","0.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

No modern game has come close. That is until this game was released.\n\nThe graphics are top notch and very realistic. The addition of trees and bushes since last year improved the visuals a great deal. The graphic improvements will no doubt continue in the future with the possible addition of 3D blades of grass using Nvidia’s graphics technology.\n\nOnline play is great with turn based multiplayer and the ability to play with up to 8 players. You can stop and resume your round at a later time. There are loads of different play modes available. If tournaments are your thing you can participate in many online. The game also has a cool replay feature that allows you to watch the last round from a number of different angles. Your opponent(s) can see the replays as well.\n\nAnother big plus for the game is the freecam mode. Take a virtual tour of the entire game from every conceivable angle and soak in the wonderful immersion that this game provides.\n\nThis game has lived up to its potential. Every update over the last year has shown improvement, especially the most recent update from last month. This community driven game will only get better in the months and years to come. Be sure to give it a try and you won't be disappointed.","April 2","true","0.1"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","43","6","14","8","0"

There are many random events that happen such asfrenzied zombies, airplane cargo drops, boss spawns and more! You purchase new characters or you can upgrade your existing ones' health, armor, health regeneration, reload rate, damage, the amount of ammo you pick up. This game has so much depth even at such a low price.\n\n\nSOUND:\nThe voice acting is just so good, I thought I was listening to Morgan Freeman whispering to me on a peaceful rainy night.\nThe musical score is just..Oh God.... Just so damn brilliant >.<!!! This is the best music to have EVER been in a game, rumors say that they had Yuzo Koshiro to compose for The Slaughtering Grounds.\n\nOVERALL:\nThe Slaughtering Grounds is the perfect zombie shooting game you are looking for, stunning graphics, great controls, and great gameplay.\nWhat can I say? This game is a masterpiece.\n\nSCORE: 10/10","December 11, 2015","true","35.6"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","38","3","8","4","8"

The Slaughtering Grounds manages to soar far above other titles of its genre and add yet another level of intricate artistic enrichment and dazzling gameplay. I sometimes feel like I shouldn't be allowed to play this game because it is so fun, and should go back to playing other games that get dwarfed in comparison to this one.\n\nWhen a novel gives me a strong emotional response to its contents, I applaud it for being superior to many others. When a game does this, I know I'm playing The Slaughtering Grounds. Some of the dialogue is the funniest I've ever heard; some of it deeply bothers me and drives me, in true anger and passion, to beat the game and prove myself... to a character in a video game. I actually feel like I am the main character in this game. At the very least, I empathize with them 100%.\n\nAnd the gameplay... like I said, there is nothing like it. Riding the learning curve of The Slaughtering Grounds and realizing that no, some of the levels really aren't impossible, are incredible experiences. The achievement and satisfaction of solving a difficult and very intellectual 3-D puzzle feels wonderful.\n\nYou may have heard people speak well of this game, and I'd like to speak greatly of it. But if all that hasn't convinced you to get it, then maybe this will: it's just fun. It's an FPS with no gun, a purely intellectual flourish of discovery, mystery, immersive gameplay, and, if you stay with it, the greatest victories you can find on Steam. Please get The Slaughtering Grounds (after you get Time Ramesside). Please do it. I would be happy for anyone that decided to pick up and play The Slaughtering Grounds, because I would be absolutly confident that they will have as much fun in it as I did.","November 25, 2015","true","0.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","2","0","0"

It might just be the best one ever made. I'll bet money that this game saved the gaming industry much like Super Mario Bros. for the NES. I'm sure you've been caught in the massive crowds of people rushing to their computers shortly after hearing about this game, undoubtedly to purchase such a once in a lifetime deal.\n\nIt has the most mature and experienced devs the world has to offer. A simple google search will show you only a hint at what this game is, for the rest of the game is simply too elaborate and mysterious for any one person to discover entirely. You do not understand the beauty of this game until it gives you a default aspect ratio that cuts off the unneeded buttons on the side of the screen like the arrows to change characters and weapons, or my personal favorite button, the "EXIT" button.\n\nThe best part about this game is the community and devs. Once you think you know everything about this game, you search it, and you go even further down the rabbit hole. You'll soon learn that the developer is a part of a massive secret organisation, possibly behind calamities as far back in time as the roman empire. Because if you find his response to video critigues, input the codes, invert the letters, look at it in the mirror, then sprinkle your computer monitor with holy water three times, your computer may explode, and if you did it JUST right, you'll be gifted with your next clue. Just remember to keep looking at your reflection's eyes until the ceremony is complete.","September 15, 2015","true","1.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","0","0","2","2","0"

There are obstacles in your way that will make traversing the map dangerous.  Earn cash, buy upgrades to improve your chance against the zombies.\n\nPros\nGame play is solid, like my ♥♥♥♥♥ after I eat taco bell.\nZombies walk at you, then stand there, and your health bar goes down\nGuns aim pretty much in the general direction you want them to shoot, and things die\nThe game gives you aids\n\nCons\nSometimes, I die, because I wasn't good enough for the game.\nSometimes, I pick up ammo crates on accident, when I jump over them. Kinda a silly bug, don't you think\nFriendly players can't see you, but can launch you outside of the map, where you are free to see all the HD textures, collision detection, and buildings that you can't walk in, but look nice.\nThe Game plays with your brain, making you click 2 to access your first weapon, and 1 to access your second weapon. This played with my brain, but once I got used to the mechanics, it was a breeze to switch weapons\nThis game DIDN'T give me aids\n\nIn Summary, this game is .19 cents, and they could have charged a dollar.\n","June 29, 2015","true","1.2"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","29","2","7","2","1"

It turns out that the developer of this masterpiece is the same developer who got drunk and made World of Warcraft in a weekend. The Music by Kevin MacLeod is pure genius and the graphics have such good artistic cohesion its almost as if the developer did not buy random stock unity assets and threw them together using a scattering paint brush tool and then not even write any code he also bought all the scripts and then he took a picture of himself with a giant ♥♥♥♥ in his mouth and then use that as the texture for every single model in the game. I really wish the developer who is very talented would sell this game for $59.99 instead of -$1000. He is under the false impression that this game is bad, but it's really not. It's on the level of quality of Uncrowded, which is literally just one unity asset pack with no modifications. It actually outshines it slightly because this was actually modified. Simply put, it's the best thing on steam right now, and I don't think you should pass this one up\n","July 16, 2015","true","0.2"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","17","1","6","2","0"

Nothing can make a gun in a game feel more akward than a skewed perspective of the weapon. It looks as if it's pointing into random space to your upper left but it indeed fires "foward". I understand the upgrade system just fine in that you must buy your damage and accuracy through several upgrades for all weapons but it is seriously distracting the way the guns are positioned to the first person view. I intentionally bought this game as after searching for the worst Steam game available this was on most lists. I got two copies, one for myself and one for my buddy (to ♥♥♥♥ him off and hear his jokes). After playing it, it comes close, there are worse in my library for sure but I can't think of any names besides Crash Time II. Would I buy it for the full price of $1? No, but I did buy it on the summer sale for 10 cent and it pooped more cards than that, thus 80% off is well worth it.

I have now stepped up to provide an opinion that is much more true and fair than 72% of other reviews. This is truely the best game I have ever bought on steam. I love hte amazing, breathtaking even, graphical capabilities of this game. I love the sprites and player models, which have such extreme detail. It plays much like CoD zombies, but there is a bigger map, providing for much more exploration. I really love that you can't hear the zombies creep up on you, so there is an actual challenge when you get hurt. I love trailing zombies around the map to find ammo and health. And don't even get me started on the multiplayer. It's an unbelieveable multiplayer experience, especially for one dollar. I've always wanted a multiplayer zombie shooter that could be on par with left 4 dead(and it's sequel) that all my friends can afford(I mean I bought for all my friends). I have put about 18 hours in so far, and am excited to put in 18 hours more. I would rate this at about a 99/100, just behind my DRM-free copy of the witcher 3, time ramesside, and Alpha Zylon.","June 23, 2015","true","18.8"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","1"
