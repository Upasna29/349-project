I should have listened and NOT buy this game, I wanted to give it the benefit of the doubt but was just disappointed in the end.\n\nNo players in multiplayer\nVery few zombie spawns and when you do find em they spawn a min after you kill em.\nLoot spawns every min on the ground. Though it'd be better if the loot comes from zombies or from stuff inside buildings\nClass selection. In a survival game? Are you insane? I understand that it's mixed with action but I didn't expect it to be like that.\nThose who said this game was like a cheaper version of Rust was a lie, I don't technically have the game yet or played it myself but I watched Bob and Markiplier play this and it was far better than this crap.\nYou glitch through an invisible hole on the ground and gets you stuck for a good 2 mins.\nI like the textures I admit but the rest is just awful.\nYou can't even climb the stairs and just fall off when you get to the top.\n\nI'm done.\nPlay Unturned, it's free, better and more fun than this game.\nThis game is not worth it.\nBut if you want to sate your curiousity then be my guest.

One, it was only $0.59. And two, I couldn't hold in my curiosity after seeing the many creative reviews. I didn't even care enough to make a desktop shortcut when it asked me to. While I created my character I picked the first model I saw just to get away from the laggy menu screen. I loaded into a desert, I imedietly noticed the great world design. Then I moved. I was suprised with the amount of lag, I thought that it wouldn't have any lag since it doesn't even need 2GB of RAM to run. After puting 6 minutes into the game I would like for two things to change. One, more graphics choices. And two, an option the kill yourself in-game. 2/5, has potential.","May 21","false","0.1"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","83","10","12","5","0"

It turns out to be an OK game. There's still alot the developer(s) need to fix and add to the game. Here are just a few of things that I think should be fixed/added:\n\n-Pickaxe\n-Mining to get metal fragments\n-Furnaces to smelt ores to get metal fragments from\n-Pictures of the items in your inventory\n-Fix picking up items (As of now you have to look for a while to find the spot on which you can pick it up from)\n-Ground clipping and glitching\n-Loot inside of buildings\n\nOther than that I think it's a pretty cool game to be honest. The game doesn't require alot to run which is kinda cool, and I think it's funny that the arms, weapons and buildings you place yourself is unturned-like.\nAt this state i would rate this game 6/10, but if a few things that I mentioned would get added I would rate it higher.","May 21","true","0.5"," 3 of 17 people (18%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","18","3","17","0","0"
