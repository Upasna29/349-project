Its full of fun little cyberpunk references, has lots of humor, exciting music, and the artwork is cute. Gemma is a fun character to play and how she interacts with her dad and brother is very amusing. Her dad owns the pizza shop and he tries to help her deal with her problems, while delivering pizza twenty stories up of course! Each level starts with a quote from dad about how pizzamaking is a metaphor for life... or something.\n\nPros: Well designed platforms, good story, great characters,\n\nCons: not terribly challenging at default difficulty, levels get repititious a bit\n\nThat said, I can't think of any other game that is both funny and emotional like this is.

I'm a Pizza Guy, and I've always wondered, why there were so few pizza-delivery games. Off the top of my head, there was the side-mission in GTA: Vice City. Now keep in mind, I didn't give Ninja Pizza Girl a positive rating because of this. Merely, a game about the trials and tribulations of delivering pizza, is the bait that hooked me.\n\nIn the future, oppressive corporations have determined that humanity is not fit to consume quality pizza. Gemma and her father's PizzaRiffic business are the sole beacon of hope. It doesn't matter that you live in slums high in the air, the Ninja Pizza Girl always delivers. However, like any other teenager, Gemma has problems of her own.\n\nWorking in pizzerias and following the game industry, has exposed me to a lot of cynicism. So seeing a game like NPG is nice. Gemma's adventures are designed to evoke positive feelings. When you the player, don't deliver a pizza on time, nobody dwells on it. Gemma simply states that she'll go faster next time. That's all that needs to be said really. This extends to the story as well. Even in the face of severe difficulties, Gemma does her best to stay positive.\n\nThe game itself is a platformer with an emphasis on speed and efficiency. Jumps have to be properly timed, obstacles must be dodged, and you want to avoid making mistakes. As the levels progress, the dreaded MegaCo. goons will harass you. It's tough being different, and Gemma will be the target of a lot of shoving and thrown garbage. Resorting to violence isn't really the answer, but she can knock these jerks down by sliding or dive-kicking their heads. However, this slight feeling of vindication isn't worth focusing on. Your sole concern is getting Gemma to the end of the level as fast as possible. In fact, it's faster just to run past or jump over everyone.\n\nThe controls are very well-done. They're responsive and fluid, so you never feel like you were robbed, when you miss a jump. There are plenty of visual cues, so as long as you're paying attention, you should be alright. An interesting aspect of this game is that when a MegaCo. bully pushes you around, they'll laugh and insult you. This causes both you and Gemma to lose focus, which can lead to more problems. In the end, it's all about confidence. When you're doing well, your reflexes feel enhanced, and every movement is perfect. Although Gemma does pick up a speed boost if she performs flawlessly, I believe there is a psychological effect as well. It's an interesting element that adds to the game.\n\nThe story of Ninja Pizza Girl doesn't last very long. Accounting for possible re-tries, the trials of Gemma will take about an hour and a half. If speedrunning doesn't appeal to you, this game won't last very long. Much of the replay-value is going to be in replaying stages, doing everything possible to shave even a second or two off the clock. Basically, the length of this game is closer to 16-bit titles. You get out of it, what you put into it. If you're not playing for the highest grades and topping the leaderboards, you'll find that this game is very easy in its current state.\n\nAlthough it is still in early-access, I think Ninja Pizza Girl is a quality game. There's depth to the controls and mechanics, which allow for speedrunning. There will be unlockables and possibly more content over time, so I wouldn't be too concerned about content value. It also helps that for the most part, this is a game about positivity. Usually with videogames, there tends to be this feeling of doom & gloom. Humanity needs to be saved from themselves, and the sky is falling or has already fallen. After awhile it just gets discouraging. Although this game does take place in an uncertain future, it doesn't focus on it, making everyone feel miserable in the process.\n\nAll in all, I'd say it's worth a look.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","July 6, 2015","true","3.0"," 46 of 60 people (77%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","77","46","60","5","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JellyJellyFru/recommended/319470/","JellyJellyFru","Dr. Professor ShootBang","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JellyJellyFru/","648 products in account","*Full Disclosure--I ended up working on the game after this was originally posted!*\nNinja Pizza Girl is unique--from its Sonic the Hedgehog-meets-Mirror's Edge gameplay, to level paths accommodating gamers of different skill levels, to the..."realistic" depiction of a portly man answering the door in no pants.\n\n7/10, would throw pizza over balcony screaming, "No pants. No pizza!" again.\n\nIn all seriousness, though, Ninja Pizza Girl's affirming messages and interesting premise really hit home when you encounter what could have been its most negative element--your fellow Ninja.\n\nThey emerge from the scenery to trip you, drop from the ceiling to slow you down, and chase you across the rooftops of NPG's future dystopia. They shove you to the ground, throw garbage at you, mock you, and record the humiliation with their phones to share on social media.\n\nIt's an eerie reflection of our modern world, and these Ninja are one of the only enemies in gaming I've truly hated...\n\nI'm in a state of flow. Leaping across rooftops, dubstep occasionally kicking in to "wub" me along my merry way. And then...A horde of them. They swarm around me, shoving, laughing and taking pictures. Gemma slumps to the ground. By tapping the spacebar/[A] button, Gemma can rise up again, regaining her confidence and dashing through once more. However, the chunk of time this situation takes has almost certainly spelled out failure for this run.\n\nAnd the funny thing is, the world of Ninja Pizza Girl is so fun to glide through I don't care about having to redo the level--I'm upset and frustrated because of HOW I lost. Because of what they did to her--and me. I want to lash out, taking out every Ninja in my way, but it doesn't provide any relief or satisfaction. Revenge feels...Empty.\n\nSo I do what Gemma loves to do:\n\nI run.\n\nI run past my would-be harassers, and in doing so gain a feeling better than any amount of enemy-stomping could have provided. Every enemy I slide through, jump over and dodge past give a sense of achievement better than a headshot, or a well-aimed kick to the face.\n\nI--Gemma, is not like them. And in Ninja Pizza Girl, while in Early Access and a bit unpolished, I can finally express that through *gameplay.*\n\nI'm not another man with a gun, shooting another man with a gun to somehow prove I'm a "hero" or "Murica." I'm a Ninja Pizza Girl, and in being different, I can rise above it all--and feel great doing it.\n\nI conducted an interview with the developer here, if anyone is interested:\nhttp://videogamesandthebible.com/2014/12/17/video-games-and-the-bible-live-14-jason-and-nicole-stark-ninja-pizza-girl-interview/","May 26, 2015","true","5.0"," 43 of 64 people (67%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","67","43","64","6","0"

The character always gets stuck on a jumping mode or a crouching mode when it arrives at the corner of something (e.g. wall) and there is no way to get up again. Sometimes the spacebar just doesn't work. So many things are happening when the character was running, it ruins the feeling.\n\nWhen I sent out this comment I have already played for 2.1 hours so it is too late to return, so I keep finishing the story. During the time, there are more bugs:\n\n1) When I do the speed run and finish the running, and I hit ESC after the score pops up and than I hit ESC again to close the menu, than the "Home / Rerun" menu pops up, and it cannot be clicked or highlighted!\n2) I don't understand why but the game frequently goes into a strange situation, than the screen begin to shake.\n3) Sometimes the game doesn't react to my key if I am pressing too fast (I play Starcraft!). For example, when I am landing and hit shift, the character crash into the ground.\n\nI don't need to comment on the game play or design.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lothy/recommended/319470/","lothy","Lothy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lothy/","1457 products in account","* Key provided by Developer\n\nDisparity games brings us Ninja Pizza Girl, a platformer about Gemma, a 16 years old girl working as delivery woman at her father’s pizzeria. In between the story deals a little with self esteem, depressive moods, bullying, et all.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised by this platformer; the graphics were actually really good (the art not quite as good, but it wasn’t bad for a cartoony style), and the performance on my lower-end PC was excellent (until you went into first person mode, more on that later). The controls were simple and comfortable, and I could pick to use either my keyboard or controller.\nThe music was really, really good. It was almost relaxing, and when it picked up pace it pumped up your energy enough to match, but didn’t make you nervous or stressed as some of the ‘speed’ platformers do.\n\nThe game basically consists of Gemma running and parkour/jumping through the many areas that make up this city. Along the way, and in later levels (each upping the difficulty a bit as they require more jumping and climbing) you will encounter opponent ninja delivery kids that will try to stop her and mock her. You will also be gathering various collectibles as you go (salvage, QR codes, etc) that will allow you to unlock outfits, extra goodies, and funny game modes.\nThe game also has a mood system (since it goes with the subject they’re going for); the worse you do on the different levels, the worse your mood gets. The worse your mood gets, the easier it is for you to collapse/fall/be unable to take the bullying. In order to improve your mood you must either buy pick-me-up items from the shop with the collectibles (games, chocolate, baths, teas… ) or new outfits (also bought with collectibles). I’m not entirely sure the message sent is right (“feel down? buy (something)!” is what it seems to say, and while it is a good way to lift your mood, it might lead to addictive behaviors on certain people, not that I actually think the average person will go out and do this obsessively, mind you), but I like the idea of the system nonetheless.\n\nThe game offers plenty of options, allowing for a highly customizable game. You can change the difficulty from really easy to really hard (by default it’s midway), the behavior of jumps, the length of time you have to finish the levels (I would have really, really loved a “timeless” option for those days I want a 0-pressure game, though) and so on. You can also use presets too if you’d rather not mess with things individually.\nYou can even customize how harsh you want the taunts/bullying to be, though I’m not sure why you would need this, but there you have it.\n\nGoing back to the menus, I mentioned earlier you can buy some extras. These consist of interviews, game art, and so on. It also includes “game craziness” goodies, one of which includes “first person mode”. While I loved the little option (even if I’m not a fan of first person), I do have a few things to remark about it: The drop in performance speed when playing in that mode for me was remarkable. It’s also not ‘really’ first person, since you still see the character’s head/body. (You’re basically right behind her head).In addition, the fact that the controls don’t change (you still are expected to use the left/right or a/d keys for moving forwards and changing directions) make it highly confusing and uncomfortable.\nStill, I’m well aware you’re not -really- meant to play the entire game like that, so...\n\nAbout the outfits you can buy, a few are repeats in color variations, and while they aren’t bad, I wasn’t overly thrilled with most of them. It would’ve been nice to see more outfit variations and either allow for a color slider to color it yourself, or simply make default colors and a wider variety.\n\nThe ambient of the city is nice, and I actually found myself liking it better when it was darker (the moodier Gemma got) than when it was brighter; not sure that was the expected outcome. It does get a little weird and slightly repetitive from time to time, but it’s not necessarily something that fully distracted me from the game itself.\n\nThere’s a last mode you can play in, “speedrun”, which includes leaderboards for those that like comparing their scores with others.\n\nOverall I was very pleased with my playthrough of Ninja Pizza Girl, and it’s a definite recommendation from me if you like platformers.\n\nAlso, the Devs are active, supportive and helpful, which is always a plus!","September 29, 2015","true","2.9"," 25 of 37 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","25","37","0","0"

It feels great to run through a level, ducking enemies and hopping over gaps while keeping up your speed, and there are plenty of opportunities to do just that. Also in an hour of play, I never once found myself thinking "Oh that's not fair, I was close enough to that pipe, I should've grabbed it!"\n\nAlthough it's an early-access release the game is actually complete, the developers just haven't finished tweaking everything just yet. For this reason I was expecting one or two crashes, but instead the most heinous offense the game committed was 'taking two more seconds than expected to start the 'Level Failed' dialogue when in midair', which I feel I can forgive.\n\nFrom what I've seen so far, the story is surprisingly upbeat - yes, rival pizza delivery people are out to get you and it's a little sad seeing the chirpy, friendly protagonist Gemma repeatedly belittled by these d-bags - but there's a lot of friendship and family and comedy too. One chapter concludes with 'No pants, no pizza!' and Gemma hurtling aforementioned pizza off a balcony in protest of a man's refusal to answer the door wearing pants. And I don't feel bad about spoiling that because there are a dozen other funny occurrences and dialogues that are equally amusing.\n\nThere is definitely an aspect of the game focussed on the social issue of bullying, but it A) Doesn't get in the way of the gameplay in the slightest. B) Isn't being used to deflect any criticism, and C) Is never too over the top to take seriously. It's a down-to-Earth, relatable game, about a pizza-delivering ninja being harassed by a rival corporation.\n\nOverall, this is the kind of game which I would hesitate to call perfect, but nonetheless I genuine cannot name a single notable flaw. A must-buy for fans of quirky indie platformers - I can definitely see myself obsessing over getting the fastest time and highest score once I'm finished. 9/10.","June 28, 2015","true","2.2"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Aside from turtles and the letter I. We have Ninja Pizza Girl, a delightful light-hearted speedrunning platformer. You work for your fathers pizza shop and happen to be studying ninjutsu. Using your ninja skills you will jump, slide, kick, and bounce your way through Ninja Pizza Girl's many levels. The fun part of the game is that it features many ways to get to your objective. Timing your jumps and using your environment is key. The game does a fantastic job of ramping up the difficulty with rival ninja pizza delivery men and even more crazy obstacles. What makes the game different for me though is the story of Ninja Pizza Girl. While not the main focus, the characters interactions with the many patrons made me smile and was a treat when I completed a level successfully. The art style is humorous and matches the tone of the game very well. With tight controls and hardly any bugs there is plenty to like about Ninja Pizza Girl. the only complaint I could find was that the music wasn't exactly to my liking. This was also compounded by the fact the music is based off how fast your moving and turns on and off like a switch, which was jarring. I wanted to see a bit more from the swag, and apparel but I don't know if this was due to my inability to get the collectibles or if it's just still being developed. Either way if you are looking for a fun and humorous speedrunning game. Why not check out Ninja Pizza Girl?\n\nI made a video preview to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!\nhttps://youtu.be/v-bnnGLhSbk\nI hope you enjoy!\nMartyr","August 8, 2015","true","1.3"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","73","8","11","3","2"

Perhaps because I have a thing for free running (I even try to free run in games that aren't made for it, like Skyrim, perhaps because I'm fat, asthmatic, and out of shape in real life xD), but NPG is super relaxing to me as I play through the levels.\n\nThe story is what really matters to me though. As a trans woman, I'm happy to be in this game with a fictionalized post-transition version of myself. This kind of representation matters to me, because I know it will matter to many others.\n\nThe game is just an extremely heartwarming experience that tackles the issue of peer pressure and bullying, something that is really important these days.

It was on sale at the time, and it looked kind of like a 2D Mirror's Edge. Well, after beating it, I'd say that's pretty accurate. But it's more than that, too. The game pieces together a story about overcoming the struggles of being bullyied, which I feel resonates with the younger folk. (such as myself) There's also plenty of pretty deep quotes that the game shows you. It's not a long game, but it's really fun and sends a good message.

This is basically every mans dream combination.\nDistant voice: What about the girl?\nMe: Gemma? Oh she's cool, BUT THE PIZZA! *mouthwater intensifies*\n\nNinja Pizza Girl is a game about a girl named Gemma, who helps her dad deliver pizza... the cool way, by jumping over roof tops like a true ninja. But Megaco, a big company who monopolises the industry in the game, hired ninjas to stop Gemma from delivering pizzas (ps: the ninjas are jerks).\n\nWhat I like:Smooth gameplay, Gemma runs and jumps fluently and there wasn't any noticable lag throughout my playthrough\nOutfits, which both look good and have a use (albeit a less interesting use as you would think)\nGreat soundtrack that fits the ingame mood\nLevel designs, with a lot branching paths and are pretty memorable\nGame Craziness, a.k.a. cheats section, most of em are tied to gaming tropes and I like to mess with the First Person and Double Jump mode once in a while\nAnd of course... PIZZA >:D\nWhat I dislike:Creepy 3D characters (Gemma looks pretty bad in 3D D:)\nRepetitive "In the Zone" theme, whenever you are at top speed, Gemma goes into fever mode (as I would call it), pretty neon rainbow streaks flow behind her. But what I don't like is the song used, sometimes I prefer the original bgm of some levels compared to the fever mode theme and I feel compelled to go top speed\nSorta boring on low difficulty and relatively short, I turn it up to max difficulty and finished (not 100%) the game in only 8 hrs\nLevel designs, sure I've said that the levels are interesting, but they seem really unnatural (as natural as you can get in a city), random gears as platforms, uneven balconies and specifically the last 2 levels felt really out of place :\\n\nFinal Thoughts:This game is a decent speedrunning platformer with some quirky dialouge. If you'd like a challenge, play this game for the first time on the highest difficulty (I did it) you'll feel pretty satisfied for completing each stage ;)\n\nAnd last but not least, this game deserves a\n10/10 Why? CUZ I LOVE PIZZA\nIn all honesty I give this game a\n8/10 Bonus points for the pizza, of course, but it seriously is a short and fun game that you should try if you are into parkour games","February 28","true","10.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

The multiple-path system ensures that even people who aren't very good at it like me can still progress while getting better, and the flow/music system really sucks you into the running. The drawn art adds a lot of character to the game, and the story (what I've seen of it so far) really works well with the theme.\n\nMy largest complaints would be that sometimes it's hard to notice enemies in time to react to them, and that the models need some work when you look at them close up, but at normal gameplay distance they're quite fine.\n\nDefinitely one of the better indie titles I've played, and the developers have been quite pleasant when I sent in feedback and interacted with them.

The subject matter also deserves attention.\n\nIt talks about bullying and bullies.  It's a subject matter close to my heart.  It was something I had to deal with all through my school years.  But back then we didn't call it bullying.  We were just told that it's how some kids were and that we should ignore it and move it on with it.  And while I did get over it and get on with my life - I will still never forget the people who just showed a complete lack of regard for their peers.\n\nNeedless to say, this game delivers one of the most poignant and personal messages in any game I've ever played.","October 2, 2015","true","1.2"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

While delivering pizzas Gemma has to overcome bullying from the rival pizza joint. The story in Ninja Pizza is a little cheesy but it has a good message. I give the developers credit for making a game that most developers would never have even thought about making.\n\nThe gameplay in Ninja Pizza Girl actually surprised me. Ninja Pizza Girl plays like a platformer/runner where you need to jump, slide and perform other parkour moves in order to deliver pizzas before time runs out. The game plays quickly as you speed through the city which makes the game a lot more fun than I was expecting.\n\nI don't mind the bullying storyline but the bullies in the game play just seem to get in the way. The bullies keep knocking you down which keeps killing the speed/momentum of the game. It is kind of annoying that you are regularly stalled due to being hit by one of the bullies.\n\nI had more fun with the game than I was expecting and I think the game would work well for kids currently dealing with bullying. The biggest problem with the game is the length. I was able to beat the game in around two hours which is pretty short based on how much the game costs. Unless you want to replay levels to gather all of the collectibles or you really enjoy speed runs I just don't think you will get a lot of playtime out of the game.\n\nIf you are interested in the game because of the theme or the game play I don't think you will be disappointed. You will need to consider the short length of the game though.\n\nNote: I received a free review copy from the developer.\n\nRead My Full Review [www.geekyhobbies.com]\n","October 4, 2015","true","2.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you've played the (quite underappreciated) iOS version of Mirror's Edge, you're basically looking at the same mechanics here, though it doesn't have the same focus on exploring levels for secrets and your character doesn't automatically run. It's a stylish and highly entertaining platformer with a great, down to earth theme that really stands out against the bombast we usually see in cyberpunk themed games, though this is only lightly such. The goal times are deviously tricky, it's taken me numerous tries just to pass the later levels not to mention getting a good grade for it, and it brings a lot of replay value to the game. And it's enough fun that you'll want to keep replaying it.\n\nI do have a few complaints: the levels don't look that different from each other, the game's music still feels like a WIP (hopefully it is), and most substantially Ninja Pizza Girl is just short on content. While it definitely has replay value if you're into going for a perfect grade, in its current state the game is only going to take a few hours to beat. It feels very light for a $13 game. Hopefully this is something that is going to be rectified in future builds, and that's fair if this is the case, it makes sense to want to get the mechanics just so before implementing all of the levels. It's something worth keeping in mind, though, since an early access game actually reaching appropriate completion is something that can never be taken for granted. Absolutely worth getting on sale, and if more, and ideally more varied, content materializes then probably even at full price. I've had fun with this one, the available content is fairly polished, the mechanics are spot on, and it definitely feels like it's headed in the right direction.","August 24, 2015","true","3.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Fix the hitboxes for enemies - i get attacked before I even hit them, and for a game like this, it's importatn that the hitboxes, delays and platforming are accurate. Fix the reason she just randomly faints for NO REASON WHATSOEVER. Give the game some sound effects instead of just the music. Colours are far too muted, please consider livening things up. I think this game has potential, but really, at the moment it is rather boring and tedious. This is a parkour game, so things really need to be smooth. Zombie Parkour Runner for iOS was simpler, but more enjoyable, and obviously didn't have a time limit. This game kinda gets muddled by having poor enemy counters, but forcing you to finish inside a set time, instead of rewarding you based on the time you take (which would be a better implementation imho).\n\nAt this stage I can't recommend this game due to the niggles mentioned, and overall being a lacklustre game due to muted colours, no sound effects, and the controls/hitbox detection (though that latter part may be just that I suck really badly). I hope this game is still in active development, because I would love to see some more effort put into it. As it is, even if you are still interested in the game, I would not recommend the price of entry, because it feels too much like the ios games zombie parkour or mirrors edge which are only a few $, and yet is lacking the gameplay charm of either of them.","September 18, 2015","false","1.7"," 24 of 52 people (46%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","46","24","52","2","2"

Its aesthetics teeter on the edge of the uncanny valley. And it's got a few technical issues.* But by smurf, it's got life despite all that, and it's totally playable. Dial the difficulty low for a breezy romp through implausible city architecture to cheerful EDM, or crank it up to grind your teeth at flow platforming that forgives no mistakes. If you like BIT.TRIP RUNNER or Sonic the Hedgehog, or want to see the kind of clever, heart-on-its-sleeve project an ambitious family can turn out today, you'll probably find something to enjoy here.\n\n*Tip: If you screw up in a level, don't "Restart"; go "Back to Shop" instead and start the run over from there. That seems to evade a run-wrecking stutter issue that crops up if you stick around in a level for too long.","October 12, 2015","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game does get harder as you progress through it but once you start playing it's hard to put down.

Reminiscent of the original Prince of Persia (Princess of Pizza?) with a light cyberpunk skin.\n\nLevels are timed, but at its lowest setting the timer is generous enough so that even very casual players can get through the game.\n\nLots of fun outfits and extras to unlock with in-game collectibles, including some modes (such as big head mode) straight out of of the N64 Goldeneye.\n\nThis one's a real gem, and very much worth full price.","October 4, 2015","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Clever uses in lighting and level design help to guide the players when markers are not readily available. There are only a few moments where the level design is questionable, but even then it is still very fun and manageable.\n\nColour varies based on your performance as does the music, reflecting Gemma's (the main protagonist) emotional state. You are a pizza deliverer in a cold and often uncarring world.\n\nPros:\nSImple idea well executed.\nNice art style (not AAA standard but ample and satisfying for the content),\nInteresting use of emotional state to convey deeper story and meaning.\nDifferent outfits to dress up in, though most are pallette swaps.\nSatisfying when you get a good run going.\nDecent graphic options for a 2D platformer.\nVariable difficulty sliders.\nIn game silliness such as first person mode.\n\nCons:\nOccassion Performance drop noticed under maximum settings.\nUnable to rebind keys (not that you need to, but the option would be nice)\nMaybe a little expensive for the content, but not by much.\n\nThe Other Stuff:\nDubstep, lots of dubstep. You might like it, you might not.\n\nIf you like platformers this might be one to put onto the wishlist for when a sale comes around.","September 30, 2015","true","12.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
