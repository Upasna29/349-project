Then I love it.\nThis isn't dungeon keeper. I don't know what dungeon keeper is, but scanning the negative reviews will tell you that people bought this game not called dungeon keeper, and then discovered that it isn't dungeon keeper, and were very upset.\nThis is a dungeon-making/ time management/ strategy game. It's pretty easy, but fun and a good time killer. There is a lot of micromanaging. That's what the game is; managing things. Managing and building.\nGameplay is pretty much the same as the last dungeons but with more objects and upgrades and a different story.\nIt's fun, really, if you like time management and city building or dungeon building sims.","July 21, 2015","true","3.4"," 33 of 36 people (92%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","92","33","36","5","0"

Has more freedom of control and design then dungeon keeper. Both making/decorating your dungeon and controling your dungeon lord to hunt heroes is a lot of fun. Only fun braking difficulty I experienced was constant soul gathering need and racing with heroes for endless leveling, leaving you always needing to push yourself harder untill immenent defeat from op heroes rather then having fun.

It's not.  Dungeon Keeper was about massing armies of minions and then trashing the incoming heros with them.  Dungeons is more about indirect hero management (very much like  a Dungeon Master in D&D) and this is no bad thing.\n\nActually I prefer the concept of Dungeons far more than I did Dungeon Keeper.  Are there enough piles of loot for hero's to find?  Are they being adequately challenged by you minions?  Is the dungeon decor affecting them?  If yes then torture the statisfaction right back out of them!  Maniacal Laughter(tm)\n\nThe problem I have with Dungeons is that it's seriously unpolished.  Trying to target the correct hero with a spell can become an excerise in twitching the camera until you can finally get the cursor to select him.  The early game generally moves too slowly and is the same process over-and-over again.\n\nYour commandos need micro-management.  They'll happily stand by and watch as the Dungeon Heart is destroyed next to them rather than attacking.  Which becomes more of a problem if one turns off the horrible voice acting; then it's hard to notice the heart is under attack.\n\nImps sometimes can't be bothered to mine out walls - 6 imps running around uselessly won't mine a wall bang in the middle of my dungeon.\n\nAutosaves are a mess, instead of saving at meaningful checkpoints they're sometimes saved on a timer.  I've played for two hours in a dungeon to discover the last autosave was in a previous dungeon.  Which bring me to my last point.  The early game is tediously slow but the whole game could have been faster paced.\n\nUnless you know what you're getting and are really looking to play Dungeons - The Dark Lord then I can't recommend it.  Which is a pity; it had the potential for greatness.","July 12, 2014","false","4.4"," 44 of 65 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","44","65","0","0"

However, in the 3 dungeon 2 hour tutorial, you'll learn its about 'entertaining' heroes that invade your dungeon and then killing them for their soul points or whatever. The heroes are attracted to certain things. Some want gold, so you need to let them collect gold before you kill them. Others look for armor and weapons from your forge, invading magicians look for your library. Still other heroes look for combat, to either take punnishment or dish it out. Thieves will come to disarm traps. It is all about making them happy to enrich their soul. So you can kill them, have your imps... I mean goblins take them to a prison where they can die. You can also torture them for bonus soul points!\n\nWith soul points you can buy things to make your dungeon more prestiegous to bait heroes in certain directions. The more prestiege you have, the wider your reach. The wider reach helps cut into rival dungeon keeper territory in multi player. You can also use soul points to level up your character's skills and magic, but really, you're pretty overpowered even if you do not upgrade anything.\n\nLike Dungeon Keeper, you have a dungeon heart. If it dies, you lose the game. This will happen in multi-player, but not the solo campaign. Everything is like Dungeon Keeper, but without charm and it all seems like so much work. Keep a hero happy then kill him. That's a new level of micro management I don't care to get into. Plus the voice acting is terrible to bad if not annoying 'A hero is about to leave your dungeon with a smile on his face,' says an imp... I mean goblin in a dreadful voice.\n\nThe first dungeon of the tutorial just lets you guide your character through combat and its an easy 20 minutes. Very misleading as to what the game is. The game doesn't really show you what its about until 30 minutes into the tutorial and then its actually interesting. You put things into empty rooms instead of building rooms like Dungeon Keeper. A forge becomes a forge, because you put forge equipment in there, not because you insta-make it with a forge room like Dungeon Keeper. Again, its micro management to a higher level. Everything you put in a room has a use, such as quality, efficiency and speed. The heroes will keep coming, they don't stop so like a factory your goblins need to be quick and churn things out before a hero comes looking for a book, but because the last hero took a book, there are no more books, so that hero wanders through your dungeon, wondering where are the books? And there are no soul points when your creatures kill him.\n\nSo its all for soul points. Who cares? Get more soul points to get more stuff? Its good for competitive multi-player, but that's not how I want to spend my time. While this game looks like Dungeon Keeper, and plays totally different, I'd much rather play Dungeon Keeper 2 with all of its charm and great voice acting. A lot of the ideas and mechanics in Dungeons: The Dark Lord are good, but its just too much micromanagement for me.\n\nI'd rather dig, explore and send waves of minions invading after heroes.","February 12, 2014","false","2.2"," 41 of 71 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","41","71","0","6"

If you could appease all heroes with everthing you put into your dungeon it could be fun, because then you could build your dungeon as you desire it but like this it doesn't work for me.\n\nA secondary problem I see is the control you have over what your character and the goblins are doing on the map, you have none, when your playing with more than 1 character you have even less. The reason for this is:\n- Goblins only do the orders you made beforehand but you have zero control over what they're doing first, so you have to do 1 order at a time or you just have to hope that they do the important thing first, but if your doing the "one order at a time"-thing you don't have time for anything else.\n- Chracters can be controlled ok, they even attack automatically what attacks them what is good, but if you have more than one character you can't do anything as you want because you can only control 1 character at a time so the others just follow the one you're controlling around and are most of the time not even near enough to help in a fight, also because of the automated following around you can't let the unused character defend the heart or any other important place.\n\nThe implementaion of a pause system, where you could manage your dungeon while not being stressed because time is running out, would also have helped to make the game at least ok.\n\nBecause of the points made above I don't like this game.","April 3, 2015","false","8.1"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","20","1","5","0","0"

Than if you dont personnally kill the heros there is a penalty of how much Happiness you can grab from them. heros often have a spawn point tht starts open near where the games starts you having a jail.

This however I do not take from the experience in the least. There's a few minor bugs, like the goblins running around aimlessly till you tell them to dig out a large enough section of wall (Rarely happens and rock doesn't count as it cannot be dug out), monsters not always going after heroes, I think this has to do with lair and hero corilation. And odd camera controls (fixed with a mouse).\n\nAbove all I'd at least rate this 7/10 as it does have lots of potinial to grow and recieve much TLC, but if you go in thinking it's a remake then don't bother, I saved you $19.99, but if you want to play it for what it is, its own game inspired by Dungeon Keeper, then I think you'll find it enjoyible.","November 8, 2014","true","7.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They just stand around uselessly while your dungeon heart is torn down by heroes, standing idle the rare times you need them in a big group fight. They won't even level at your pace, meaning you are going to max out your favourite hero of the trio and leave the "rest" to hide behind your dungeon heart! What on earth where the programmers thinking?\n\nSo count out the so called "story" , the cool-sounding group hero mechanic and smooth gameplay, what is left? The new dungeon-type: Ice is the only new cool thing I saw while playing.
