"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CheckeredZebra/recommended/334850/","CheckeredZebra","CheckeredZebra","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CheckeredZebra/","44 products in account","Borderline on buying this game? Read on.\nI bought 1931: Scheherazade on sale, probably for about $10. I was very borderline on the purchase due to reviews, but ultimately enjoyed myself. I nearly loved it, in fact, and am going to play it probably several times over. So it hurts me to have to say that this game is *not recommended* for anyone that doesn't deeply love the Otome/Visual novel niche, especially at full price.\n\nI'm writing this review because while the other reviews aren't wrong, they don't really pinpoint exactly where the game fails and where it shines. I want to help you decide if you would enjoy the game despite its flaws. I very much did.\n\nIf you really like it, why not recommend it?\nThe huge problem with 1931: Scheherazade is its stats/time system. Even on easy, the obstacle level system is unbalanced and poorly explained. Let's say you spend turn after turn leveling up one stat or, like me on my first try, randomly trying to grind a few things evenly to support a specific playstyle. Once you get on the "same wavelength" with the game, it isn't too unfair to get around in most situations. However, 1 of 4 things will happen to you early on.\n\nThe one stat/inspiration you ended up grinding meets close to the obstacle level! Hooray, you pass.\n\nThe one stat you ended up grinding isn't used, and instead this other random stat (NOT listed on the obstacle challenge list) has just as high of an obstacle level. In fact, the stat you prepared for might not even come up in the challenge depending on the options you play, and there's almost no way to tell. I've even done a few that listed several obstacles, only for me to have to face none. There's also the opposite, where I only had 1 or 2 of the listed obstacles and the rest are unlisted obstacles.\n\nNone of the stats you've evenly grinded meet obstacle level. You blunder your way through the mission and wrack up a lot of stress or you save scum and have to grind some more.\n\nThe challenge you were grinding for is removed as an option because its time limit (which is not shown to the user) is up. This doesn't happen very often and namely has only occured to me at the start of the game, but it's extremely confusing and frustrating when you're just getting into the game's groove.\nThis game would have greatly benefitted from a dynamic system that adjusts to your skill level. One that could tell what level your skills are and initially adjust the obstacles to something reasonably above that to push you to do better. Even the inspirations you train for can be random and not be enough, forcing the player to save scum to keep up.\n\nStress itself adds so much to the obstacle difficulty. Have a tiny bit of stress and watch the obstacle levels skyrocket.  But, like every other stat you need 10 points to get a grind bonus of +1 to stress stats. This wouldn't be so horrible EXCEPT random events that have obstacles can appear and affect your relationship with other characters. This can be a big deal when trying to romance specific characters that are known to be more difficult than the others. It's not balanced at all when it comes to raising stress-related stats (which can come up quite a lot) and the risk of failing obstacles. You can even rest away your 2 stress only to get an uncontrollable random event that only exists to give you stress, making you waste turns for no reason.\n\nInstead of a dynamic obstacle setting, everything is on a linearly increasing difficulty path by what I assume is the ingame date. Do you have 0 Diplomancy because you haven't needed that skill at all? Do you suddenly need Diplomacy for a required skill? You might be out of luck if you're later in the game. Even when training the whole time until your next trip, you might not have enough time to reach the requirement and will miss out on the rest of that character's entire romance subplot for the game. Oops.\nAKA, the stat mechanics and requirements suffer horrendously from a lack of clarity.\n\n\nGRINDING THE STATS THEMSELVES CAN BE TEDIOUS.\n\nOn the plus side, by saving and loading at just the right time, there's an "infinitely grind stats without using a turn of time" cheat I figured out myself. On the minus side of that, there's no way to "skip" days, which was a problem even during my first playthough (which was legitimate). While in the early game you can never get enough to meet some obstacles or, in mid/late game, a random new high level obstacle for an arbitrary skill can come up, the rest of the time could be spent just clicking getting to the next thing, which just points at a completely different game design balance problem.\n\nThat's a lot of flaws. So why did you like the game anyway?\nI need to make it clear that I love these types of games. I love branching and well written stories, and Scheherezade has that. I can tell that, mechanical balancing aside, a lot of love went into the references and story of this game and it shows through even the frustrating grind.\n\nThe art, while not breathtaking, was varied. It was detailed: characters would visually wear costumes that only appear for a few scenes in a single quest, to comedic effect. Even the goons got things like alternate costumes, pallet swaps, or their own designs. It quite grew on me.\n\nThe female protagonist is strong, competent, and adventurous. She was fun to play as. She was always getting into odd adventures, some ridiculous, some daring, and she was always good humored. She's almost always entertaining.\n\nThe dialogue and choices can be witty/funny. I'll give an example of an optional (Key word: Optional) exchange between characters:\n\nFemale Protagonist: (Excited) Roland, Roland, Roland! We've had a sighting!\nRoland: And when she said his name THREE times, all her fondest wishes came true...\n\nAnother is when a pesky squirrel stole something important. I was given the option to use the "fisticuffs" stat on the squirrel and proceeded to have a showdown with it.\n\nThere's a lot of these.\n\nOptions, even the ones just there for fluff, get unique responses at the least. Most games don't do this. Want to be pessimistic? Optimistic? Plain goofy? The people around you will respond uniquely in-character.\n\nIt really does feel like an adventure. Sometimes the writing might go over your head if you aren't a buff on history/old religions and their gods, but there's this atmosphere of adventure and exploration that comes with helping the protagonist figure out, say, the puzzle of the mechanical statues that control hidden panels of the tomb. Or stopping the mafia auctions of priceless artifacts. The list goes on and it's all good fun (if you managed to get your stats/inspirations right).\n\nThe game has a lot of meat on its bones, even with the long-winded grinding system. I doubt even in my 20 hours that I've barely broken the ground for all this game has to offer. The content is unique, it's engaging, it's fun, it's humorous, and there's a lot of it.\n\nThe characters (even the minor/side ones) are interesting and can make multiple appearances. I've only finished one romance but all the guys seem interesting and have a good chemistry with the protagonist. I found myself amused by everyone's antics and goals. The ones that know each other have their own amusing interactions and stories, as well. Basically, almost everyone is endearing and entertaining in some way.\n\nThe epilogue is pretty detailed and, dare I say, touching. Nearly every discovery, adventure, or friend you make takes a full circle at the end, resolving everything quite nicely.\n\nI'm running out of space here. I could say more positive stuff, but alas, no room. Hope I helped.","January 27","false","33.7"," 79 of 83 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","79","83","2","9"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/curseyourichards/recommended/334850/","curseyourichards","curseyourichards","http://steamcommunity.com/id/curseyourichards/","347 products in account","How I wish I loved this with no misgivings. In theory, it's got it all: Prohibition! Travel! Archeology! Intrigue! Romance with a mummy!\n\nIn practice: overly complicated interface! Unbalanced stats system! Info dumpy dialogue that lasts so long I could go make a sandwich! And a heroine, Sadie, who is inexplicably both a Girl Genius and Too Stupid To Live.\n\nDon't get me wrong: 1931S:TLoP has merits, and it's commendably ambitious, which is why I'm not giving it a bad rating, but a lot of things drag it down.\n\nThe UI issues alone make it exhausting to play, and eat up a lot of time. Like other stat-raisers, 1931S:TLoP has menus for the MC's traits/skills, jobs/tasks to raise them or get other perks, etc., but the UI design is far from intuitive. It's very pretty, but lacking the functionality that keeps the mechanic from being boring.\n\nLet's say you want to raise one of Sadie's skills. From the map screen, you navigate to the skills menu. Instead of an at-a-glance list, there are buttons for each skill category. You must then hover over each, look at the sub-skills that pop up beneath, and if the one you want isn't there,  move on to the next. There are dozens of sub-skills, too, so unless you've got a photographic memory, good luck remembering which one belongs to where.\n\n(On a technical note, sometimes when you hover over a skill category and then try to click a sub-skill, the list disappears, so you have to go right back and try again. Arg.)\n\nWhen you finally find the stat you want, you click it, then wait for a list of tasks to pop up in a sidebar. It should be as easy as clicking what you want to do, right? Nope! Clicking the task drags you back to the main screen, where instead of doing it, you're faced with all the tasks that take place in the same area of the map. This then requires you to skim over the descriptions of the jobs that are available to find the one you need, click it, then wait for a bubble to pop up to let you know it's done.\n\nSo, to sum up, it's open skill screen>hover over one of several categories>select one of 5-6 sub-skills>select task>open task screen>find task in group of 1-8 tasks>select task>complete task>repeat.\n\nThen you have to do this all over again. And again. And again. Three of these tasks in an in-game day, often. In another game, you'd learn the available jobs, the stats they raise and their locations pretty quickly, thus cutting down on some of this time suck, but your character regularly ends up on a new map with new tasks that are grouped differently and raise different sets of sub-skills, so you have to learn them all over again only for that information to become useless the next time the MC travels.\n\nSound tedious? It is. This problem could be remedied by a simpler menu designed for function instead of form, but as is, it's a mess, and I'm sure I spent more time going between menus than actually advancing story. At first it's not so bad, but a full day of tasks that takes about five seconds in a game with a better interface takes about thirty in this one. That adds up fast.\n\nThe unbalanced stat system is also a pain. You train a skill as high as it can go and still need to use "Inspirations" (skill point boosting items) to complete adventures, but you can only carry so many Inspirations at a time, and each one is only useful for a few skills. I guess this is fine if you're planning on a specific strategy, and playing through a single storyline, but if you want to keep your options open and explore--as one might in their first few playthroughs--it's limiting.\n\nIt also suggests, to me at least, an incredibly broken system. Even if you max out a skill, it only goes as high as 10 points, yet some of the challenges require scores of more than 100, and the boosts carry between 1-10 points. So, if you come up against a 100 point challenge, best case scenario, you'll STILL need at LEAST 9 Inspirations to complete it. Adding insult to injury, you only have space for a limited number of boosts and those have to be acquired through the same slow system as skill points.\n\nThis is bad enough, but many storylines don't have a break between skill checks, so even if you horde enough Inspirations for a high score in Grace, if the next skill check requires an equally high score in Riding, you're screwed.\n\nIt's ridiculous. You don't pay someone a penny, tell them that's all they're allowed to earn and then demand they give you a dollar. Like...??? Why would you do that?\n\nThe less technical aspects of the game also suffer from some problems. The writing isn't bad, but it can get dull.\n\nAs you'd expect in a VN about archeology, there's a lot of history/myth relayed through dialogue, but it goes on forever and grinds things to a halt. (Not good, considering the menu/stats issues already make the game feel slow.) It seems like characters spend more time reciting textbooks than being characters, and my eyes glazed over more than once even though I'm interested in history and myth.\n\nIn contrast, the relationships you can pursue are refreshingly breezy. They're a bright spot in the game and make it all worth while.\n\nFinally, we come to the main problem with the writing: Sadie. I want to like her. I do. But: when she's not being unrealistically competent, she's holding the idiot ball.\n\nRunning into danger that ought to get her killed despite other characters' reasonable caution, she stumbles from disaster to disaster wide eyed and stupid, yet survives without a scratch. It's bewildering, and makes me long for the sense of danger in other games of this genre where doing boneheaded ♥♥♥♥ WILL get you killed.\n\nShe's the hero, I get it. Heroes are lucky, and do "brave" things that are also dopey but live to push the plot. Still, even Captain Kirk has a transporter accident or ten, and when Harry Potter does something dumb, it has consequences. That's not the case here, and it's disappointing. Sadie is Teflon; nothing negative sticks to her, even when it logically should, or when it would make a more compelling story. Even things like failing challenges and maxing out your stress score have NO impact on anything at all.\n\n(It's also annoying that she'll give other people a hard time for doing the same stupid things she does but nobody calls her on that hypocrisy.)\n\nI should also mention the lack of same sex and love interests of color, which bothers me. (Ahmose technically counts as a PoC, I suppose, but he's bandaged head-to-toe so it feels like a bit of a cheat, really.)\n\nAdditionally, there's some unfortunate implications in that, despite traveling to places like Egypt, New Orleans, Peru and Turkey, where white people should be outnumbered, they're still the central focus and the non-white folks who show up are either thugs and thieves who try to kill you or bit characters who get one line, with rare exception. This is a highly problematic oversight, to say the very least. I'm sure it was unintentional, but still, the dearth of fleshed out, non-villainous PoC makes me uncomfortable.\n\n***SPOILERS***\n\n\nAdding to my discomfort is the story's climax in which Sadie has the opportunity to use a magical relic to potentially keep the Nazis from truly coming to power in Germany but instead goes, “LOL no *destroys artifact*” because reasons. There's a very thin rationalization for this but, uh...perhaps not the best plot point to use, there. It's pretty difficult to enjoy the game knowing that the narrative unintentionally makes Sadie—and you, as you can't do anything to keep her from this action—complicit in not stopping the rise of Nazi Germany.\n\n\n***END SPOILERS***\n\nAside from these things, it's not a bad game, just has a lot of little finicky issues. I'm hopeful that the sequel will be more intuitively designed/streamlined, which will definitely make for a more enjoyable experience. I'm sure that even if the sequel's dialogue remains as overstuffed as 1931's,  it'd feel like less of a slog with a better interface.\n\n7/10","May 21, 2015","true","54.3"," 53 of 61 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","53","61","2","3"

The game will take you to several locations around the world, each with its own set of missions and tasks from which to choose.  Each story or side mission will have a series of "obstacles" to overcome, each of which can usually be tackled using a couple of different approaches, depending on which stats you've been favoring.  You raise your stats at various locations around town (unlike most visual novels, which have 3-5 stats, there are probably 30+ stats here), but there's also a twist on this mechanic: in addition to your permanent personal stats, you can also obtain "inspirations," which are essentially cards that will give you a one-time boost to certain stats.  Inspirations vary in type and quality, so it will be up to you to explore each location for the best combinations!\n\nI really enjoyed the story and characters.  Although the plot in certain mission lines can get rather convoluted, it's always a fun ride when Sadie's at the helm.  Some scenarios just plain made me smile. :)\n\nSince this is a visual novel at heart, the gameplay consists of reading, making choices in menus and maps, etc.  The game takes place over one year of in-game time, and there are so many different quests and branches from which to choose, it's not possible to see everything in one playthrough, even on Easy difficulty.  Although there is a charming tutorial, expect to spend your first couple of in-game weeks flailing about and generally failing objectives as you get accustomed to the flow of the game.  There are multiple romance-able characters, but even if you choose not to romance a certain character (or any of the characters), full friendship routes are still available, so the characters don't totally disappear from the game like in some visual novels.  This means that, while I enjoyed the romance aspect, even if you choose to remain single, you still get a complete gaming experience.  I just finished my first playthrough, which took about 19 hours, and I'm looking forward to jumping right into a second to explore some of the content I missed the first time around!\n\nAs far as technical things go, the location maps are super impressive, the menus are well-done, and character art is generally good (although the CGs are not always great).  The music is lively and era-appropriate; at the beginning of the game, it really impressed me.  As the hours wore on, though, it did get rather repetitive, so a few more tracks might've been nice.  I noticed that a few lines of dialogue seemed to have the wrong speaker's name on the text box, but this was rare, and the only bug-like thing I encountered (trouble getting achievements to register) was promptly fixed by the developer a couple of days after launch, so everything seems to be very stable.\n\nTo summarize, Scheherazade is a fun, extremely meaty visual novel game that oozes atmosphere and charm and even manages to incorporate a considerable degree of strategy in the form of stat-management mechanics.  Recommended for fans of VNs and those who want to explore a girl-Indiana Jones-type plot full of adventure!","April 7, 2015","true","22.5"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","16","16","0","0"

In this one, you play as Sadie, an aspiring archaeologist, as she goes on adventures in various locations around the world. Like many similar games, you have a year to build-up certain skills in order to achieve the best ending on the route you choose. Unlike others, you also have a card based element to the game.\n\nIn order to successfully pass an adventure, you need to not only build-up your skills but also gather cards (or inspirations as they're called in the game) to play during the capers. This involves some strategic thinking, which I loved since in a lot of otome games the skills building can get a little monotonous when you're just spamming a certain trait.\n\nI also love the time period (1931), supernatural elements, and that you don't have to chose a romance route in order to get a good ending. However, the romance options are wonderful. So far I've loved the ones I've played through. My only frustration is that it's near impossible to figure out how to get someones best ending.\n\nAll in all, this is a really great game.","August 28, 2015","true","52.4"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","18","21","3","0"

I still have  that copy. I enjoy it very much.  We follow Sadie, a daughter of famous archeologists, during her archology studies and the adventures she gets into.\n\nIt's adventurous, it is humorous, the setting is refreshing, it's sparkling and fun.  I have a great sense of adventure. It s a stat raising game. I LOVE stat raising games and this one  makes  stat raising really functional by having trials you need to overcome on a path of choice.  The game combines so many things, and you can choose "routes" to change Sadie's  "dream". I love that. It guarantees replayability, making the game fun each and every time.  My favourite paths for Sadie is Nigel because I really love the character and find him well matched and I trully enjoy the progress and the adventures Nofel and Sadie get into all the time.\n\nIn most otomes you chose a route. Here in this game that skillfully combnes elements known to me from  otome, visual novel, stat raising and adventure games, you can LITERALLY chose a route and then follow it thorugh in various locations Sadie travels to as part of her quests. Storywise, a lot of effort went into this because whle the game has an overarching story of Sadie, it branches out into so many paths you can have Sadie follow, it's really incredible for me. I love the sense of travel and adventure!\n\nAlso, the many endings you can achieve depending on the fullfilmment of the dream points and depending on difficulty levels make it really enegaging.\n\nSadie is a really nice main character, intelligent, spunky (if a little reckless sometimes?), kind, polite, educated, has a strong presence and I do care for her. I really enjoy travelling and adventuring with her.\n\nThe design is interesting, we chose adventures and activities from various maps and the maps are varied. when an adventure ends, it shows up as a newspaper heading. Those little touches make it so much more fun. Because this game has so many elements to it, I never feel bored and never have a sese of routine. It's exciting all the time for me.\n\nThis is such a thoroughly engaging and fun game for me. I have been told there is a sequel planned that will continue from the ending chosen by the player. I generally don't like sequels but I look forward to this one as I really like the characters, the setting, the great flow of the text, engaging stories and setting and stat raising. There is really a LOT packed into this game and it is a real keeper for me among the many games I ever purchased in my life.\n\nI enjoy it when I can. I have had this game for a few years already  and I still haven't reached 100% completion. It's immersive, it's fun, humorous and adventurous and one of my best purchases ever, a game I really love for the sense of great fun and adventure and extremely rich content. It feels like a genuine labour of love and it is very fun to play.","November 29, 2015","true","2.4"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","12","14","0","0"

As some people have previously mentioned, the game is clunky as all get out. The skill system took me a while to understand, and even longer to fully use to my advantage. There is an unpredictability about events, as well, and not the good kind.\n\nLet me give you an example: Say you want to do an adventure with Roland in Egypt. Okay, cool. It says the skills you need are Grace, Escape Artistry, Dodge, Problem Solving, and Perception. So you beef up those stats a little, maybe add some inspirations (they act as booster cards for your stats) and then you start the adventure. Well halfway through the damn thing,  the game, through no fault of your own, forces the stress to go up about 9 points. (When the stress is high the ability to overcome obstacles in the game is greatly impeded.) So basically, even though it says you'll need Perception, the game never tells you HOW MANY perception points you'll need. And you may end up using all your inspiration cards to overcome one stupid hurdle in the adventure.\n\nBut that is only one problem in the game.\n\nThe other one, the major one I'm dealing with right now, is that you need to have your relationship points up to at least 30 with a bachelor by Christmas, or no ending with that bachelor for you. But the problem is, say you're courting Ahmose, the Mummy Dude, and you only get ONE opportunity to woo him by Christmas. Right now, I'm in November and I have only seen one adventure with Ahmose available, and that was in Egypt. My points with him are at an 11 right now, and I definitely won't get to 30 by Christmas. However, I have seen other people court him with no problem. Are the capers (the adventures) randomized? I've never seen an Ahmose adventure beside the one in Egypt so how the hell am I to get him to 30 points.\n\nOther than this, I can tell you I love this game. In the last few days I've spent almost all my time on it. But DAMN its got some serious issues. I would like a clear understanding of how the game works but, seeing as there is very little out there in the way of guides and other such things, I think I might just have to restart the game and figure it out.","June 25, 2015","true","70.1"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","2"

Definitely no. If you don't like stat raising aspect, you'll probably get bored very quickly. Also, if you're looking just for romance story, this is probably not the best choice. Don't get me wrong, romance is there and it's good, but story is so much more complex (which is awesome for me, but not for everyone). It's pretty good written, it has interesting characters and allow you to choose how to act in certain situations (though, most of the time, it didn't really felt like it had any real impact). All of potential romance options are intriguing (but mummy for the win!) and likable. As for protagonist... Well. I like her, but she has pretty annoying moments and I can imagine that some people may not find this as charming and funny as I did.\n\nPros:\n+ game length\n+ many routes\n+ many adventures\n+ good writing\n+ good graphic\n+ interesting and deep characters\n+ challenging...?\n\nCons:\n- ... too challenging, I'm afraid, especially if you decide to play your first game on normal (or higher) difficulty.

To add insult to injury, the game will frequently heap penalties on you before you even get a chance to react.  Even on easy I failed far more tests than I passed, and it felt like that was intentional on the part of the developers.

Although they aren't romances like what's in a Bioware game, it's more like one character becomes your most valuable friend.\n\nThe rest of this review is isn't so much a review as it is a public service announcement explaining what this game is. Basically, this is a visual novel with a huge amount of dialog to click through, also, there is the RPG/Stat-Raising/card-game thing which kinda sucks. So as you read through the dialog driven scenes there are skill checks you pass (to gain small stat increase) or fail (increases a penalty stat makes tests a little harder), although whether you pass or fail the scene will still happen.\n\nThe skill checks take the form of a card mini-game where the passing score is achieved by adding cards to your baseline score (your collected cards have 2-4 different bonuses on them). Once the scene is over you can replenish the cards you have used by going around town ("seek inspiration"). If you have high skill stat or a high relationship stat with a particular character then the cards you get from them are very good - I think, I'm not exactly sure. Alternately you can increase your stats ("boost") although I didn't feel much of pressing a need when the baseline bonus is so small even when at max. And there are many stats to increase, something like 20 different stats. Of course, the most important thing to do in town is to "go on adventures with..." the other characters (once you have enough cards available).\n\nAs for the art, it's great for a steam visual novel with lovely backgrounds and nice characters with many expression transitions. The soundtrack is swinging bepop jazz which is a little repetitive, but I didn't mind. Also, Steam Achievements won't work offline.\n\n1931: Scheherazade at the Library of Pergamum is a great story game with RPG element that kinda sucks is a worthwhile purchase when it is on sale. It's a must purchase if you love stories with strong female protagonists.","December 2, 2015","true","1.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","2"

The only thing I enjoyed was the characters' personalities and most of the dialouge.\n\nThe stat building is slow, drawn out,  and there's too many stats in a game that requires you to level out pretty much ALL of them if you want the ability to do all the actions you want to do.\n\nThe game requires to have stats over a certain level to successful do some actions. Honestly, the best way to do it was to use cards that give you bonuses. However, using cards for stat bonuses were frustrating since it would be through luck or walkthrough if you had the right one. There's too many stats and the cards only brought up 2-3 stats significatlly.  Not to mention, after the first few choices, you hit areas where the required stat levels are too high for just one of your cards.\nIt was an interesting mechanic, but probably would've been more fun if the cards held more stats to give more of a chance to have one that worked for the situation.\n\nDialouge more often than not seemed to cut off and feel incomplete as well despite the clear hard work they must've put into it.\n\nTraveling in a VN and the cards with stat bonuses are very interesting elements and it could've very well this VN into a gem. However, it still need to be properly balanced, along with the stats in general, to be an effect part of the game.","November 26, 2015","false","2.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Overwhelming at times.\n+ Music is nice and atmospheric.\n+ Choices open up alternative paths, such as skipping skill checks.\n\n+/- Art is ok. The sprites are ok. The ending CGs are kinda meh. It looks really flat overall.\n\n- Text heavy. This game is meant to be played in breaks because there is too much information to digest. A lot of stuff flew over my head. I would have LOVED a term library- such as what Hakuoki uses, so that I could have had a better understanding of the archaeology terms and of the time period.\n- The romance endings end with cliffhangers hinting at a sequel.\n- No scroll back to see missed dialogue. Quick load is useless. It goes to the load menu instead of auto loading your quick save. The skip/quick save/quick load are inexplicably hidden at the bottom right corner in TINY MOLECULAR FONT.\n- The menus are clunky. It was easier writing down dates in a notepad. There are no warnings about automatic events, unless you write down the specific dates.\n- Stats are complex. There are too many stats and not enough time to pass events.\n\nHere is a breakdown:\n- Stats are valued at 100 = 10. To pass events, you need to pass a 10+ score. 5+ stress increases that number.\n- You use +skill cards to make up the rest of your score.\n\nExample: Checkpoint says 23 Occult Lore // 100 Occult Lore = 10 points // 1 card has +13 General and +7 Occult Lore = 20 Occult Lore // base score 10 + card score 20 = your score 30\n\n- On Easy difficulty, the highest checkpoint (Turkey, Dream, and Main events) goes to 65+ (5-15 stress). On Hard difficulty (or a lot of stress) goes well over 100+\n- Individual events are grouped into 4-10 checkpoints. Checkpoints use diversely different stats. You have to know ahead of time which stats to work on first.\n- The game lets you carry 10 cards initially. To increase your carry limit, you need to successfully pass Dream/Main Events. Passing them rewards you with great cards (20-90 general)\n- There are time limited sections. You must constantly cycle through raising a stat, farming cards, passing events, passing hidden automatic checkpoints, lowering stress, and repeat to the next section.\n- Skills are grouped under trees. The tree has a separate 100 value. A high tree score makes it faster to train the skills under that tree. You can only earn tree points passing certain checkpoints and dialogue choices. It's NOT randomized, but there are NO complete guides so you literally need to make your own walkthrough to know what checkpoints give out what skills and tree points.\n\nExample: Occult Lore is under Wits. // 100 Wits = +10 Occult Lore w/ stat raising // Spend 10 turns raising Occult Lore to 100\n\nIn conclusion, the game was too text heavy for my tastes on top of a difficult stats system that I couldn't really enjoy myself.\n\nIf you are a completionist, this game will leave you unfulfilled. Stats and achievements are still bugged, including some that effect which endings you get. There are no complete guides and with so many endings, you will not see all of them.","November 20, 2015","false","79.2"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

I bought it on a whim, it looked interesting, and I haven't been able to stop playing it. The way I've been describing it to people is a "The Mummy-esque dating sim", but it's really so much more than that! It reminds me a lot of: The Mummy, Young Sherlock Holmes, Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries, but it's also very unique and isn't a derivative of any of those. You can play through it and completely ignore the dating sim aspects, or you can focus solely on one gentleman at a time and have a completely different gameplay each time.\n\nPros:\n1) Very well written, I found very few errors & the dialogue very rarely felt forced\n2) Humourous, very tongue-in-cheek, great meta references, good at making fun of itself without getting repetitive, great timing\n3) Very well-planned stories, similar themes without being repetitive (you can't play through one guy's story and then know how the other guys are going to play out)\n4) Stories integrate very well, each story arc gives you more and different information about the other arcs\n5) Characters have good depth, you don't have to restrict your responses (for the most part) just to get the right amount of points with your chosen guy, so you can choose what you want for Sadie (with a few exceptions)\n6) Well-drawn characters (a bit repetitive, but not so much that it's bothersome)\n7) Great music, I find myself whistling the main theme a lot\n8) Long-ish, even if I "speed through" plots I've done before, it still takes me a good afternoon/evening to get through a  new storyline\n9) Stat spamming can get obnoxious but once you understand how to get around it, goes relatively quickly\n10) Very personable characters, even when they're trope characters, they've got more depth than you'd expect, and I'm overly-attached to all of them by now\n\nThe only real con I have is that the stat spamming is a little too involved. I think it could be cut down, the instructions could be expanded a little, and it would be nice if the point gains for the main categories (+wits/charm/athletics/etc) were more predictable; as it is, you pretty much have to make a "map" of the point games and replay solely to try to max those categories, which I don't feel is ideal. However, this doesn't affect my gameplay at all, and in no way interrupts my enjoyment of the game.\n\nThere ARE cliffhangers (from minor to large) in each guy's ending, however. I know there's talk of a 1932 but I don't know if/when it's going to happen, so keep that in mind if cliffhangers bother you.","January 18","true","69.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Also, the research that went into the game in terms of both archeological and time period/setting information is terrific.  I was impressed how much I learned and how much I enjoyed the learning!\n\nA couple of things to note:  the game is challenging, even on Easy mode, so you do need to pay attention to the stat building and be willing to make decisions about how you want the story to develop; the game is long, so creating strategic saves for when you want to go back and try an alternate path is a good idea.  This isn't a 2-3 hour game, and for those of us who want to do everything perfectly on the first go it can be frustrating at times.\n\nThere are two things missing to make this a 10/10 game:  a way to track key scenes and endings (there is no gallery, which is a real shame - so take screen shots); a sequel (1932 was promised back in 2012/13, before this game made it to Steam, and now that I've played 1931 I want it!!).\n\nA real gem of a game for those with a bit of patience - some of the best writing I've ever seen in the genre.  9.5/10","February 7","true","272.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Except WAY too complicated! It takes much too long to raise your skills so you can play the games Capers, I'm not expecting to become an expert in something in just a few clicks, but God! And you only have a few spots for Inspirations (stat boosting cards) which means if you're trying to raise a stat you're most likely going to one or two spots so you don't fill up your Inspirations too fast.

My current game record is just from my first playthrough following Nigel's path and ignoring the others aside from Sadie capers.\n\nAnnoying things: Too many stats even for a stat raising game. At some point it doesn't matter if you maxed out your stats because what you need is card collecting strategy. Seriously, it's how you play your cards right in the end, collect the best cards and use them when needed since the level you need to pass is 20-50 while the max stat is 10 (and that's on easy mode)\n\nAs stupid hard the gameplay is I still think it's good for it's very large content.","November 2, 2015","true","128.4"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"

If two important caveats apply to you.\n\n1) You like reading and history. A lot. If you're the type who whines about subtitles, don't buy this, you will hate it. There's a lot of awesome historical background and neat information I want to read more about - but I was a card carrying nerd in school and frankly, still am. You've been warned.\n\n2) If you don't object to the point/skill system being frankly clunky. Sometimes you have no idea what skill you need, and sometimes you don't get a 'rest' to go get more inspirations and you have to stumble your way through your caper, which is irritating when you're trying to romance someone. It's counter-intuitive and frankly took me a few play-throughs to get the hang of it.\n\nA third caveat: this has very little replay value, at least if you're interested in the romances. There's only four. I would love a good otome/visual novel/dating sim for straight girls that isn't full of creepy catboy stereotypes.\n\nThat said, I'd still recommend this on sale. The writing is really, really, really good. The period research is excellent. And the characters made me, more than once, laugh out loud quite genuinely. I wish there was a "meh" recommendation instead of just yes or no. Out of five stars, I'd give it 3.","December 29, 2015","true","22.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are a ton of little superficial stories that don't really connect and the game-play is tedious. The art is bad, even painful at times. There are no backgrounds pictures during the stories and the music, though good, is limited and doesn't match the tone of any of the scenes.\n\nI played for 20 hours before I got sick of it, so sick of it that I didn't even bother to get a single ending. I bought the game for 75% off and played it for a decent amount of time so maybe it would be worth buying for some people.

That said, it's more interesting than any other visual novel I've encountered, and there is more of a "game" element to it, due to the cards--inspirations. It's still more text, reading, than anything else though, so if you don't like that, you won't like it. Personally, I really like Sadie, and the writing has gotten a few smiles and one almost laugh out of me so far, even though I haven't gotten that far into it yet.\n\nEdited review: I finished this game tonight, after having restarted it completely once because I'm stupid.\nAnyway, my recommendation for it is now even higher than it was. I loved this. I've played other visual novels and liked them, but this one is far, far, better than any others I've played. It's good enough that having finished it, I won't be removing it from my hard drive. I'll be playing it again to try for different endings, to try to complete things I didn't manage to complete the first time, and just because I really like the characters and the story.","January 20","true","169.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's decent replay value, since you won't be able to do all the quests or achieve all the relationships in a single playthrough (though replays back-to-back get slightly repetitive).\n\nBut what I really want to commend, as someone who studies history and archaeology, is the game's consideration of preservationists' responsibility to indigenous cultures and artifacts. Who has the right to study/dig up/disrupt ancient sites? Should artifacts be kept on site, in local museums managed by the indigenous populations, or in more affluent and globally-accessible (Western/British/American) museums? While Sadie is generally perfect and above reproach in many ways throughout the game's narrative, she is constantly rebuked by locals for being, as an archaeologist, a glorified thief or treasure hunter. So the game accurately portrays its time period in that way -- that the early 20th century was a time of paternalistic theft by Western archaeologists who didn't trust non-Western cultures to preserve their own history.\n\nSo, as a student of history, I was pleasantly surprised to find that this game didn't just glorify archaeology as the discipline of white, Western treasure hunters, but rather critiques exactly that sentiment and the time period in which it's set.","January 30","true","491.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
