Gameplay is solid and varied, and the music and sound design oozes with authenticity and epic pleasure, which is very fitting for the space setting.  The writing is also extremely charming and includes thoughtful commentary, and the equipment-allocation element is very fun and new (symmetry rules!)  I can tell the developer really hit the nail on the head with this one, and I'm so glad they did.  Highly recommended, one of my favorites of all-time.","July 13, 2015","true","4.6"," 24 of 26 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","24","26","0","0"

It's pleasantly deceptive, in that there is far more going on than initially meets the eye.\n\nPROS:  interesting graphics and art style –  screenshots really don't do this game justice\nreally good music -  don't be surprised if the "Lone Ranger Theme" song pops in your head at some point  :D\nfluid and intuitive gameplay\nlight, witty banter\nan AI despot to thoughtfully guide you in tearing an extra orifice in most of the life-forms you encounter\ngood variety of ships and enemy encounters\nunique and interesting ship customisation allowing scores of outfitting options\nrogue-like\nthe feeling of skilfully progressing as a player\nhuge re-playability\ngamepad support -  though I highly recommend mouse, mouse/ keyboard\nlevel editor\n\nCONS:\nno Steam achievements\nIf you like FTL, SPAZ or just arcade space games in general, this game will hook you. Each level has forward-moving, branching pathways for you to choose. Guided by Control, your AI helper/ dictator, you'll encounter Nemesis (your enemy), ships in distress that will become fighting companions to an extent should they survive the skirmish (some of them offering some kind of beneficial boost), cryopods to be rescued (the number of those rescued goes toward unlocking many upgrades and ships), armaments, cash-flow, and space anomalies, rocks and intriguing organisms. The story is simplistic, but thought-provoking and hinting at something sinister afoot.\n\nAt first glance, the encounters seem similar, until you realise there are various kinds of space rocks that react differently when fired upon; anomalies that affect your ship in a variety of ways and anomalies that can appear owing to results from specific recipes of mayhem; and organisms that may or may not be eye candy or passive-aggressive. A boss fight awaits you at the end of each level, and your ship and its armaments do matter. And speaking of ships, the outfitting is really fun and different, requiring thought and puzzle piece-placement with some restrictions - it's very creative and it really just adds to the game in a great way.\n\nDespite being rogue-like, you do feel a progression in your skills as a player. Your deaths, and there will be many, do not feel out of your control. To the contrary, if you do die, it is solely your fault, and not some random roll of an ether-die. Like me, you may approach this game in a casual mood but it always turns into determination, bursts of triumph and ending with NOOOooooooo defeats. Upon defeat, you may choose to continue for cost, and you will if it's an encounter you just need to get out of your system; but mostly you will Abort because in doing so, the game is at its most rogue-ish (as well as the money you make stockpiling toward unlocking ships and upgrades eventually).\n\nThere are so many fun mechanics going on here, reminding you of this or that game; but honestly, Starship Rubicon is a game in its own right. I would be floored if it doesn't become a cult classic. The developer is friendly and involved, proud of his work, and he should be. I look forward to what he may develop in the future and wish him and Starship Rubicon great success.\n\n9.5 space popsicles out of 10  ….

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/XmiseryX/recommended/372030/","XmiseryX","Misery","http://steamcommunity.com/id/XmiseryX/","382 products in account","So, I havent had all that much time with this game just yet, but... even after just 90 minutes, I can honestly say, I think this game is brilliant.  It's good enough that it leaves this impression on me that quickly... for me, this is very rare.\n\nStarship Rubicon is an interesting beast.... it uses a whole pile of different elements that were inspired by many seperate games.  But the thing that makes it so good is that it takes all of these disparate elements, smashes them together... and they WORK together.  They dont conflict with each other at any point.\n\nAt it's base, this game uses Asteroids-style gameplay and controls.  You have a "thrust" button to move your ship forwards, and then other buttons to turn it left or right; you also have a "boost" function that you can use.  There are even actual asteroids floating around in many areas, which work pretty much as you'd expect, and generally making your life that much tougher.  From there though, the game goes in it's own seperate directions.  Your ship is not static, but is instead made of various "parts" that you can equip, that give abilities or change stats, or things like that.  This includes changing both your basic weapon (and you can have more than one) or your special weapon, an activated ability that has a cooldown and also knocks out your shields for a bit upon use.   You cant just equip everything though; each piece of equipment has a shape to it, sort of like blocks in Tetris.  You have to fit these blocks inside the ship properly, or they cannot be used.  What's more, some items are meant to modify others, and will only work if linked to the system they're modifying, which means you have to place it adjacent to that system for it to function whatsoever.  So this can create some interesting decisioni-making when you're changing your equipment.\n\nEquipment can be either found in battlefields, or bought in stores. Stores are easily the most frequent way to get equipment.  The rate of equipment actually being FOUND is very low... a bit TOO low in my opinion.  You end up not getting all that much total, which is a shame, because it reduces the amount of interesting decisions that you'd need to make.  There's no need to decide between two items after all if both of them easily fit onto the ship.  If you're not getting enough items, you wont be filling it.  So there's a bit of RNG issues here with this system, but it's not enough of an issue at all to detract from how well it works.  There are many different weapons and things to find, so look for them, and try them out, and see what kinds of builds you can make for yourself.  Most of these different items and such are also just plain fun to use.... that's ALWAYS a plus.\n\nBetween missions, you're sent to sort of an overall sector map.  It's very similar to the map that FTL uses, in that you move forward from one node to the next, with each individual node having specific links to other nodes to choose from.  Around each node, you can see icons representing the different enemy types that are going to appear in that area, so it's important to learn these and have a look as you make decisions.  Other things will appear here too, such as hazards, or the existence of items or "money asteroids" or shops or various other things.   You can also find other ships to rescue, and if you are successful in saving them, they will join you on your quest.  Each one provides a unique ability that becomes active whenever they participate in a battle with you, and you choose when to bring them in by clicking them on the sector map.  They have a cooldown time afterwards, and can also be knocked out by enemies during battle... so take care of them, when you bring them with you.   The one big problem with them though is that they just arent very bright.  Asteroids in particular will give your AI allies alot of trouble as they repeatedly crash into them.  By the late game, these guys arent as useful, simply due to the fact that they'll be knocked out of the fight too quickly to help much.\n\nAnd on the note of the enemies you face, each type is different from the last, and you quickly learn to recognize each by it's appearance, which is very important.  There are different approaches that you should take depending on just what you're fighting, and what weapon you're using, and there can be many enemies at once.  Some enemies may have beam weapons, or maybe homing missiles, or shields, or even the ability to shield other enemies.   And of course, it wouldnt be a shmup of any sort if there werent gigantic bosses to fight at the end of each sector.\n\nAll in all, there's alot going on for this game, and I think there's plenty of replay value; naturally, everything is procedural when it comes to the maps and sectors and such, so each game will be different.   The campaign is short, but that's typical for this genre, and probably for the best.\n\nIs it worth your money?  If you like shmups at all.... I'd definitely say yes.  It easily lives up to it's asking price and more, I think.   I can definitely recommend this one!","November 30, 2015","true","1.6"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

The difficulty curve ramps up nicely, and the controls are stellar. It's got a bit of everything; the classic space shooter mechanics you'd expect, with semi-FTL-style upgrades, ship unlocks, etc.\n\nIt's a roguelike-like, so you're expected to die and start over, and it doesn't hurt to do so, death just makes you want to get further next time.\n\nIt has gamepad support if you need that, but I find I prefer the mouse controls, which is a first for this kind of game.\n\nThe graphics and soundtrack are top-notch, and really  help set the mood. You have a funny AI companion through the whole thing as well, adding more charm. As someone in another review said, the screenshots don't do it justice.\n\nThe Windows, Mac, and Linux versions look and feel identical, I had no issues running either version.\n\nHighly recommended to anyone who loves space shooters, or those who have been frustrated with space shooters in the past, and think they would love them with the right controls.\n\nMy hours on record for this game are low because I played the game mostly before its Steam release.","July 31, 2015","true","1.4"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","0"

The game's difficulty could go here, but it's not horrible. Many improvements have been made over the course of development to ease the game's difficulty.\n\nTips: Collect as many blue orbs as you can, they are currency. Repair ship in-between battles\n\nStarship Rubicon is a fun and challenging game, which was inspired by Asteroids. This takes many players back to their childhood playing classic games, something that's missing from many modern day games. However, this is not simply a clone.\n\nEssentially, the player is a lone pilot out to defeat an alien nemesis in space. At the beginning, the player is given the option of a few different ships to use, each with it's own attributes. Over the course of the game, these ships can be upgraded by purchasing parts at a ship or by finding equipment stashes on the map. Other ships can also be unlocked.\n\nThe game is challenging, but by participating in the progress of the game, I've seen vast improvements to help make the game a bit more easier.  While defeating enemies, the player will notice blue orbs dropping from defeated enemies or by shooting blue asteroids. These are the currency for the game and it is best to collect as many of them as possible. Luckily, the Steam version has made these center toward the exit upon completion of battle.\n\nhttp://cheerfulghost.com/GregoPeck/posts/2583/steam-review","July 31, 2015","true","1.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

The time really flies...\nEverything I want to say about this game has already been said via other reviews, but I want to throw my vote into the pile of 100% positive reviews that this game has at the time of this review.\n\nThis game is about forward progression through zones, exactly the way FTL plays. The zones split off, you can choose to pick which direction you want to go. You'll even be granted preview of what types of enemies will await you should you choose any specific direction. Note, like FTL, there is no backtracking, so the choices in direction you make will matter. You might find items on certain paths, new allies, bonus cash, or shops. Each zone is guarded at the end by a boss, so make sure you beef up as you go.\n\nThe ship customization is pretty terrific, it's extraordinarily simple, yet deep. You have limited space on your hull, and all customizable parts are in configurations of shapes, which you can rotate to make fit as best you can. The more parts you can pack into your ship the better. You will be pleased to know the weapons, abilities, and effects you can add to your ship are quite large in number, so the replay value is pretty huge. Some attachments can alter how weapons work, boosting various attributes.\n\nThis game has Neutonian physics, so you can turn on the thrusters, suddenly shut them off, then spin the ship around to fire at enemies behind you, while still gliding in the same initial direction. The combat system is great, everything feels fluid and polished. When you beat the game, you can bank the cash from the campaign, use it to unlock powerful new weapons, or even ships. You can also access a hangar to customize and build your own ships with access to all parts.","July 21, 2015","true","9.8"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

It's easy to grasp the basics, yet the detailed physics engine, creative stages and lots of diversity in enemies and friends show how much thought went into the creation of this game. The game is easy to get into and play for short amounts of time but has a lot of depth and complexity to explore that make you play it over and over again. There's lots of ship customizability that makes the game accessible to different playing styles - you can play fast and action-packed, slow and calculated, or luck of the draw by stocking up on weapons that allow you to run around in a confused panic and then deploy all your ammunition at once. The amount of variation between the different ships and types of levels allows for all sorts of challenges, and the ability to save up and unlock new options means that you never get stuck doing the same thing over and over with no progress.\n\nAlso, the game has a lot of style. Both the graphics and music are really captivating. There's a wide variety of ships, weapons, and enemies to interact with. If you feel like tutorials are for chumps you can get pretty far just by ramming into your enemies (and fist-bumping your friends). If you like figuring out the intricacies of a game there's a lot to explore here, from critical hits to reflecting lasers off of inanimate objects and shields to creating your own levels. If you despise fighting and just like drawing cool contrail patterns, you can usually pull that off too. Your onboard computer, who narrates much of the game, has plenty of snaky comments to make when you fail. The allies you can acquire will have conversations with each other, making it fun to gather different groups together. Sometimes, there are biscuitfish, which are like biscuit-shaped cuttlefish. They float around in packs and trill and cycle through the colors of the rainbow. I don't understand them but they make satisfying sounds if you blow them up.\n\nI would definitely recommend this game! It's well worth the price and a great game to come back to again and again.","December 5, 2015","true","9.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Controls are operated by the mouse and two keys on the keyboard.\n\nYou play through the game with a map that looks similar to FTL, and at each system you have to defeat a group of enemies. Only a small amount spawn at a time, with new ones spawing after you kill of some of the previous ones, until you have defeated all of them. There are 5 stages, with a boss battle at the end of each one.\n\nThe game can be challenging the first playthrough, because you have to use one of the weak ships that you start of with, but after beating the game for the first time (or save up a lot of money) you unlock the hangar, which enables you to customize the ships, upgrading them before launch, and then spending money equivalent to their value to launch them.\n\nSome levels have a fellow human ship in them, which, if they survive that battle, wil join you, and different people have different abilities which can sometimes be quite helpful. Other levels have a shop, where you can spend money to upgrade your ship. Other levels have cryopods, where you have to quickly collect them before being overun by an endless enemy fleet. For some objects in the shop you need to have enough cryopods to be able to purchase them.\n\nControls:\nThe ship faces towards the mouse.\nMost weapons fire on left click (shields do not block attacks whilst left click is held down).\nRight click thrusts accelerates the ship in the direction it is facing (there is a max speed depending on the ship) (the craft will not slow down on its own).\nShift activates afterburn, which provide greater thrust, but rotating speed is limited whilst in use, and it cannot be used if the ship has overheated.\nSpace fires secondary weapons/abilities, of which a bit of them cause the ship to overheat.\n\nVery good game 10/10\n\nMy prefered way of designing a ship is lots of shilds, with a single powerful low rate of fire weapon.","January 21","true","9.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
