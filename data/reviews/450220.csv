"http://steamcommunity.com/id/foxBoxInc/recommended/450220/","foxBoxInc","fox","http://steamcommunity.com/id/foxBoxInc/","255 products in account","On the heels of classic Descent (and Freespace), the strong design pedigree immediately shines through - the glowing eyes of the robots, the punchy sound, the (optional) 90* auto-leveling, the subtle bob of the ship when stationary, getting lost looking for the exit door after blowing the reactor - it's all here. Overload feels fantastic and I would encourage anyone reading this to try it out.\n\nThe teaser will likely run you about 30-45 minutes, with a nice training section, sample mission, and endless(?) survival challenge mode. Unity 5, looks and runs fantastic. Feels great on both Keyboard + Mouse and 360 Gamepad, and looks as though it should support a HOTAS setup (update: doesn't seem to support an X52 quite yet). Very technically impressive for a pre-alpha.\n\nAs of this writing, Overload currently has 3 days remaining on Kickstarter: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/revivalprod/overload-the-ultimate-six-degree-of-freedom-shoote\nI only came across it the other day, but it has been picking up Steam and making notable funding progress while I've been watching it - it looks like it could very well pull off an 11th hour finish (and I hope it does), so if you're interested, please give the folks at Revival some support!\n\nThanks for reading!","March 7","true","1.4"," 65 of 71 people (92%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","92","65","71","6","3"

If you played Descent when you were younger, it's back, proper.\nThe two designers for the original Descents have made a proper spiritual continuation, it looks and plays exactly as it should; you smash panels and parts off repurposed mining robots until they go fireworks, while they try to extract the meaty bit from your ships metal shell using various methods.\n\nThe controls are intuitive, the momentum physics behave as you would expect, the weapons have a solid feel to them (even the frickin laser beams) and each connecting hit gives a physics reaction and a pretty light show as reward.\nThe sound is great, the baddies sound suitably demonically possessed, the lighting is a real treat, accurate realtime shadows (something of a rarity these days for some reason) are on full display and it all sits together in a surprisingly atmospheric package.\n\nYou still get as disorientated as the original Descents and the screen fills with carnage quickly, but that's a positive in this reviewer's book.\nThe story is to be written by the writer of Freespace 2 and the music is from the original Descent's crew, many Parallax (original Descent) developers are in the team, making this a very exciting project.\n\nCheck out the Kickstarter for more info, definitely check out the excellent free teaser demo, it's nostalgia redone right.","March 8","true","2.2"," 41 of 44 people (93%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","93","41","44","3","0"

Some have been bug-ridden trash, others have been moderately acceptable if lacking polish, and a couple have been well-made but lacking in important features like multiplayer.  But the true look, feel, and pace of the Descent originals have only ever been rivaled by the equally-venerable competitor, Forsaken.  Even the recent entrants to the field, Descent: Underground and Sol Contingency, pay homage to their forebears while not quite adequately delivering the full experience.\n\nAnd along comes Overload, a game on Kickstarter with the intention of doing just that, coded and produced by the same key players that brought us the original Descent franchise... and you can tell.  This game may not carry the same name (because Interplay owns the name), but the look, sound, and feel are all decidedly Descent in every way.\n\nThis is what I've waited for, and it absolutely must be made.  The teaser demo above gives you everything you need to know.  Even in a pre-alpha state, with joystick support almost nonexistent, you can still tell what this is capable of.  If you loved the original games, run (don't walk) to their Kickstarter page and make sure this gets funded.  Right now.\n\nSeriously.  Now.  Go.\n\nEDIT:  Build version 4, which should now be on Steam or will be shortly, fixes all the joystick issues as far as I can tell.\n\nEDIT2:  The Kickstarter got funded!  Keep an eye out in 2017 for the release!  And they've comitted themselves to a multiplayer DLC, so all is right with the world.

Since I started following this project a few days ago, a playable teaser was created, updated twice, put on Steam (this version), had VR support patched in, and more. These guys are good at what they do, and they clearly have passion for it.\n\nTHIS TEASER IS FREE!\n\nSo, try it out, and if you enjoy it, head on over to kickstarter and support them.

They've improved it though espcially with the cool cave system.\n\nOne of my most favorite parts is the flair. It acts really good.

Descent broke the mold and changed the industry when it released back in 1995, and those of us who played it back then have never forgotten the amazing gameplay and immersive, claustrophobic environments. In the intervening years a few others have tried their hands at the 6DOF genre, but no one gets it as well as the people that created it. The original devs from Descent 1, 2, and 3 have come back together to form Revival Productions and have demonstrated again why we need them to create the true successor to the Descent series. There's something about the way that they blend the feeling of the movement, the weapons, the enemy design and AI, the level design and art, and the sound and music to produce something that just can't be matched by their imitators. If you've ever wondered why a euphoric grin spreads the faces of those who grew up with Descent whenever it is mentioned and why we can't shut up about it, play this teaser and KICKSTART THIS GAME!","March 8","true","1.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The graphics and lighting are superb in Overload, actually -- however, what defines Overload and other 6DoF games is its controls and movement. "Movement" even written sounds uninteresting, but I would argue that it is the most important attribute in any game.\n\nIn Overload, you have complete freedom -- you can circle-strafe around your enemies vertically... and they can do the same to you! The game plays fast -- there are ambushes that await you, and you will really have to use your noggin to survive. It is difficult to describe, just try the teaser (it is short and sweet) to see what it is about.\n\nIf you have never played Descent, then Overload will be a completely new experience for you -- there is nothing else like this genre and these games are few and far between.

My friends and I would play Descent matches over null modem, LAN, and dial-up, for years. First batteling it out in Descent I and then in Descent II. I even made a few levels with the Descent Mission Builder. One year for my birthday we played a Descent II LAN game for 24 hours straight in a single, small (but great!) level (our weapon updated D2 port of Mega-Death). I have played Descent a lot, and have continued to play it thanks to DosBox and Descent Rebirth. We even had a weekly on-line tournament going for the past few years, until recently. I am not the best Descent player out there, but I have the best time playing Descent and playing Descent multiplayer. I have only played the 'teaser' build on a system made mostly out of spare parts, and I already see Descent II almost as a distant memory. Much like Descent I was after playing Descent II. No other game has captured the immersion, the feel, and the greatness of Descent I & II until now, until Overload. The Overload team is creating what, twenty years ago, would have only been possable to see in their mind's eye. Overload is the true vision brought to life.

I had to ask the BBS owner special access rights for the files. Then I had to beg my parents to leave the phone alone so my download wouldn't be interrupted. Then I waited for hours as the 6 whopping megabytes (!) were being sucked through that little copper wire. And boy, was it worth it!\n\nHow things have changed. I clicked "download" on Steam, waited 2 minutes for the 600Mb teaser to install, and I was ready to play. And boy, how things remained the same!\n\nThis is Descent all over, but that's not all good. We're in a new millenium now, and we do expect a bit more.\n\n1) The lighting of the levels is exactly as it was 20 years ago: all dark gray, with some lights thrown in at odd angles. No volumetric light, no fog, very little dynamic lighting. Crank it up guys, I want explosions to light those rooms up! I want sparks bouncing off my monitor!\n2) The enemies so far seem pretty dumb and follow a recipe that's 20 years overcooked: see player, make warning noise, approach player, shoot once every while. Wolfenstein did that, so did Doom 1, 2 and Descent 1. That was a time when precious CPU cycles had to be spent on graphics. These days, I have CPU cores idling and begging for smarter enemies! Give us AI! Give us sneaky backstabbing bots! Give us cooperative swarms! And my pet peeve in all shooters: give us enemies that PULL THAT TRIGGER as long as they see the player! What enemy is going to release their trigger just to prance around a bit? Make their guns a bit weaker for balance if you have to, but MAKE THEM USE IT!\n3) The levels I've seen so far are entirely static. I can practically see the vertices of the mesh. If my ship is a converted mining operator, I would've really liked to dig some new holes. At the very least, shooting my "digger", my lasers or the rockets should have *some* effect to the walls. Apart from a few "scorched" marks, that's probably not going to happen because it would require a rewrite of the engine and a redesign of the levels. Oh well.\n4) If a bot charges into me, surely that should impact my camera, my trajectory, my rotation! None of the bots seem to have any weight to them. All animations seem entirely static, just like 20 years ago. Add some rigidbody physics please. Even if a rocket impact doesn't kill them, it should at least toss them around a little bit (that would be a reason for them to release their trigger temporarily). Hitting them with lasers should also send them spinning. Heck, getting hit should send us spinning as well! The lasers should blind us, too. Getting hit needs to be scary!\n5) Aiming with a joystick or a gamepad is always a bit difficult for me. I used to play with mouse and keyboard but this time I'm trying the gamepad. I'll need to practice more before I know whether I like the gamepad.\n6) music is MIDI synth straight from the 80's. I wouldn't mind something with more oomph.\n7) sound effects seem to have been copied from the Descent 1 project folder. Give us more echo, more ricochet, more stereo, more surround, make us hear the debris around us!\n8) we're in the future, but our ship couldn't have a litlte rearview mirror? Really? ;-)\n\nIt's not all bad, though!\n6) As in the earlier Descent, the levels are wonderfully desorienting. Up is left, right becomes down, forward twists up, down twists backwards. This room looks familiar. Maybe I was here upside down? Love it!\n7) My heart started pumping when that little yellow bot charged straight at me! And boy, was it difficult to strafe out of the path of destruction and at the same time get my crosshairs trained on that overactive little bugger for long enoug to shred it to pieces. And BOY, did it feel good when I finally got it!\n8) yup, it still feels good to jet forward on full thrusters, guns blazing, rockets lighting up the twisting tunnels and not care about scraping my ship against the dirty rocky walls.

The map design is solid (and has secrets!), the challenge mode is engaging enough to keep me coming back on separate occasions, and the UI, though basic, is surprisingly clean and well-formed, when they could have quite reasonably gotten away with bare text and ugly typos.\n\nIf this is what they can accomplish for the sake of a last-minute Kickstarter-saving gambit, the final product will be a thing of stunning beauty.\n\nAlso: More "Descent" than Descent 3 was. This is a perfect return to the game's roots.

Some successfully bring back what made those games great, and some bring new innovations to revitalise the IP. However it is seldom both.\n\nDoom as an example, has gone from its original demon killing fast paced mayham, then a slow paced action horror game which lost all of what originally made it great. That has become clear to the developer, and is now adapting both what made the original great and bringing modern innovations capable in todays gaming.\n\nBut why am I talking about Doom, when this is not Doom?\nWell, Overload is a perfect example of a developer bringing back what made a game great (Descent) during the same era, and updating it with new innovations.\n\nThey have demonstrated in this demo that they are bringing back the fast paced robot destroying action, with the great 6DOF movement that made the original an instant classic, whilst still embracing the innovations in modern gaming.\n\nThis demo is a prototype build they have currently made before even being funded to actually produce the game. Yet it feels far more polished than you would expect in those circumstances, with far more enjoyment then you would expect.\n\nI recommend having a play of this demo, and see the potential behind this tiny glimse of what this developer is capable of, and if you like what you see go back the game on kickstarter. Because if this demo can entertain you, imagine what they will produce further with that funding.\n\nThanks for reading, and I hope you enjoy this hopefully soon to be master piece.","March 8","true","0.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However it is seldom both.\n\nDoom as an example, has gone from its original demon killing fast paced mayham, then a slow paced action horror game which lost all of what originally made it great. That has become clear to the developer, and is now adapting both what made the original great and bringing modern innovations capable in todays gaming.\n\nBut why am I talking about Doom, when this is not Doom?\nWell, Overload is a perfect example of a developer bringing back what made a game great (Descent) during the same era, and updating it with new innovations.\n\nThey have demonstrated in this demo that they are bringing back the fast paced robot destroying action, with the great 6DOF movement that made the original an instant classic, whilst still embracing the innovations in modern gaming.\n\nThis demo is a prototype build they have currently made before even being funded to actually produce the game. Yet it feels far more polished than you would expect in those circumstances, with far more enjoyment then you would expect.\n\nI recommend having a play of this demo, and see the potential behind this tiny glimse of what this developer is capable of, and if you like what you see go back the game on kickstarter. Because if this demo can entertain you, imagine what they will produce further with that funding.\n\nThanks for reading, and I hope you enjoy this hopefully soon to be master piece.","March 8","true","0.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The map design is solid (and has secrets!), the challenge mode is engaging enough to keep me coming back on separate occasions, and the UI, though basic, is surprisingly clean and well-formed, when they could have quite reasonably gotten away with bare text and ugly typos.\n\nIf this is what they can accomplish for the sake of a last-minute Kickstarter-saving gambit, the final product will be a thing of stunning beauty.\n\nAlso: More "Descent" than Descent 3 was. This is a perfect return to the game's roots.

Also from reading the description of the game too, they stated that it was from the creators of Descent (I should start reading that). Besides that anyway, the game looks really good especially if you're someone who missed the  old Descent days and just want to dive into that sea of nostalgia. Sadly this was probably a time that I was still way too young to know about video games like this so I'll just leave the rest for veteran players to review that part. As a new player, it was a pretty simple and fun game but I wish they added something with a more modern content into it. It's still a alpha/beta build anyways so they might add a little bit more here and there.\n\nDon't let it sway you from playing this game though, this game is pretty fun at it's current state if you want to pass the time and cry a little inside whenever you get shot down by the robot that's been strafing left and right which you can't seem to hit for some reason #me\n\nBut anyways, for anyone who would like to check our gameplay of it out, we invite you to this link:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/6B0le-E0uXU","March 18","true","0.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Having played Descent 1, 2, and 3 years ago naturally I was intrigued. So gave it a whirl. About the game:\n\nRobots moved and behaved similarly to Descent. Perhaps even smarter. There was one robot that charged at you with saws. That was pretty cool and a bit unexpected.\nWeapons felt right and very close to original Descent. I stumbled upon some favorites, like the Fusion Cannon (called Thunderbolt here I believe). I'm hoping a Plasma Cannon clone appears too. It might already be in the alpha, I'm not sure. There were also some new weapons or new twists to weapons.\nFelt my dinner move around in my stomach as I went through the tight and cramped corridors dodging enemy fire WITH auto leveling turned off. This isn't a negative but an absolute positive.\nThe rush to find the exit after wrecking the reactor was there too.\n\nIn fact the game felt so much like Descent that after setting the controls as how I remembered them, I felt right in home with no effort having to relearn anything (with exception of the new weapon names and what they were in original Descent). The controls felt on point with what you'd expect from Descent. If they keep it up and it only gets better from here then it's definitely a must play for old fans. It's only missing the PTMC as far as I can see.","March 22","true","0.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Also from reading the description of the game too, they stated that it was from the creators of Descent (I should start reading that). Besides that anyway, the game looks really good especially if you're someone who missed the  old Descent days and just want to dive into that sea of nostalgia. Sadly this was probably a time that I was still way too young to know about video games like this so I'll just leave the rest for veteran players to review that part. As a new player, it was a pretty simple and fun game but I wish they added something with a more modern content into it. It's still a alpha/beta build anyways so they might add a little bit more here and there.\n\nDon't let it sway you from playing this game though, this game is pretty fun at it's current state if you want to pass the time and cry a little inside whenever you get shot down by the robot that's been strafing left and right which you can't seem to hit for some reason #me\n\nBut anyways, for anyone who would like to check our gameplay of it out, we invite you to this link:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/6B0le-E0uXU","March 18","true","0.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is everything I've been wanting from a descent game since Descent 1-3 came out, and even if it doesn't carry the name, after playing it you will understand. This game has the heart and soul of descent. The atmosphere is created by the levels, music, and robot sounds. The bots dodge, flank, and run away from you. Controls felt perfect, and that was at the default settings. Very well done, and this is just the playable teaser. It's free to try, and you should.

These games all feel like the old descent.\nThat being said, this game does not feel like Descent at all. The feeling is very similar to the Descent Underground, which I also have, and it feels like instead of a ship you are piloting a tank... that can also fly. The action is not nimble, you are not agile and able to dodge bullets, you just move slowly from side to side while silly robots pretend to shoot at you and miss stormtrooper style. Overload does have something better than Descent Underground, the bots are slightly more intelligent making the single player a bit more interesting. It still falls short of original descents and Sublevel zero or even Retrovirus. I paid 20 EUR for Descent Underground and was dissapointed even though it also claimed to be developed by members of the old Descent team. Therefore I am not going to back Overload in its current state, I will only be dissapointed again.\n\nSuggestions for potential improvements:\n\nPlayer ship speed should be higher, ships smaller and bullet size smaller so as to make the player able to dodge incoming bullets or charging robots. The player should feel like Neo in Matrix not like a ship in a naval battle.\n\nFocus on gameplay first not on graphics. Yes graphics are important but they don't have to be top notch realistic to get a    good feeling from the game. E.g. Sublevel zero does not have realistic graphics but it is a very nice game.","March 8","false","0.8"," 16 of 77 people (21%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","21","16","77","0","3"

And its so good.\nWhat made Descent great was the craftmanship of the design of such a complicated play environment.\n\nThese guys have nailed that feel of Descent, yet made it look and sound modern and fresh. Without sacrificing the IP by trying to appease every type of gamer. They have kept Descent intact. I am so pleased and impressed.\n\nPlaying this was a breeze. I've just finished a 80 hour work week with little sleep, and I felt at ease as the movement with the mouse and kb is so intuitive and with the mouse assistance even the most casual of players will find it very easy to get into.\n\nThe weapons are great, they have impact. They make you want to kill more bots. With their cool death animations and sparks which I loved from the UE4 demos hehe.\n\nEven the music is spot on, the techno vibe which just immerses you into the world.\n\nMan, the only meh point at this stage, is the performance is maybe a bit choppy on my 670gtx. But the game looks great! So well crafted design, such a good excecution. I can't wait for more!\n\nSuper amped and glad I backed.","March 11","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198018236378/recommended/450220/","76561198018236378","The Gray Stone","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198018236378/","55 products in account","TLDR: Awesome demo, with one or two missteps. 5-20 minutes of fun for free, I recommend.\n\nThe game is slightly disorienting but it's got some real potential. I rather enjoyed my five minutes of zero-G dogfighting, and I hope to see the game come out swinging when it releases.\n\nThe good:\n1: Movement. As the game says, you can move freely in any direction you please. the experience is like flying a space helicopter with no set up or down. The game will orient you somewhat, helping to keep you in line with walls and floors, which is really helpful. In addition, all enemies will orient themselves to match you, which makes them easy to swiftly recognize and fire on.\n2: Mechanics. I will admit, the system of grabbing powerups and weapons feels a little old-school, but the weapons themselves aren't bad. Though the driller wasn't particularly exciting, the flak gun was fun, and Lightning felt badass. The explosives were slightly more confusing, as I had no idea what a 'creeper' was (It seemed to be a sort of grenade, so I ended up panic-spamming it a lot) but they felt alright.\n3: Presentation. This is a pre-alpha teaser, and as such it didn't have to look amazing, but looking at the enemy ships (Robots?) gave it a good sense of style, and the effects looked pretty nice. And this is only pre-alpha. If the art keeps improving, it'll look great!\n\nThe bad:\n1: The reticle. It's rare to have an element of the UI affect the gameplay, but the reticle (The 'aiming crosshairs', for those who don't know) got in my way a bit. The shape was helpful is figuring out how my primary weapon's shots would land, but the lines were thick and bright enough that looking past them to see threats in the distance was rough. It's not a big deal in many of the more confined corridors, but there was at least one or two dogfights where I wanted to turn it off. In the end, it's a small, easy fix that ought to be fixed fast.\n2: Weapons satisfaction. I know it might not be true that EVERY weapon in a game is satisfying to use, but a few of the weapons' sounds, effects, and function weren't super fun. Particularly thinking of the driller and the falcon missiles. Not a big deal, as there's enough other guns to find and test out (Flak is fun, guys. Find it, try it, celebrate the fourth of july.) that you'll have fun.\n3: Lack of direction/instruction. This didn't affect me a WHOLE lot, but it was pretty easy to get lost in some of these levels, and though I think the tutorial map told you about the driller, there weren't a lot of tooltips for the weapons, telling you what they do and such. The starter gun, driller, and flak all function as machine gun weapons, but the lightning gun is a charge weapon reminiscent of a megabuster. The falcon, hunter, and presumably devastator are all rockets, but the creepers are grenades. They might not've been hard to use, but a little blurb about them in the menus or a more dedicated tutorial would help. Certainly, the tutorial helps you move around, but it doesn't teach you much about the weapons or the objectives. I personally had no idea what the reactor was, or how to destroy it when I tried that mode, and though I found and killed it by trial and error (And luckily found the emergency exit BEFORE I messed with the reactor) I wasn't sure if I was supposed to just blast away or do something nuanced, like shoot at the 'eye'. (PS, the answer is blast away. It's not obvious, since most weapons don't immediately rip it up, but just keep shooting. Or better yet, explosive spam.) It seems like a big problem, but again, it ought to be an easy fix.\n\nThe neutral:\nThis game is definitely better with a gamepad. Just be ready to mess with your bindings, I personally found X/A to rotate and LT/LB to raise/lower to be a bit weird, and I honestly need to swap it.\n\nVerdict: It's not perfect, and there's some work to be done, but trust me: It's not bad. It's just a quick free demo to show off the mechanics, and it was kinda fun. Slightly disorienting, but fun for sure. Just grab the fun guns and go to town for a few minutes. Would I recommend this if it were a full game? Maybe not. Would I say it's a great demo/teaser, and it's made me intrigued to see how the full game turns out? Hell yes. I mean, it's free, and it's like ten minutes of your time. Go for it!","March 13","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Winding through twisted passageways filled with demented robots around every corner, pulse pounding as you try to peer around the next bend only to hear the lockon of a homing missle from a red hulk that snuck around behind you somehow or was behind a door you just triggered, these types of thrilling moments had me on the edge of my chair the entire time I was playing those games. Throw in the six degrees of freedom and it's like playing Quake or Doom but unchained, where movement in any direction is possible and fighting takes on a whole new level of skill. Suddenly ceilings or walls become floors and up or down become relative. Which really sucks when you have an entire twisty spiderwebbed level to traverse to find the exit door after blowing a reactor.\n\nAll of these things play through my head when I think of Descent. I was a part of the Descent:Underground kickstarter and look forward to great things from that side of the house. These are the original guys however that first blew my mind with the genre defining game. After playing just the demo, I can say it feels like I'm back in that first great trip through the mines again! There aren't many bots, but they are unique and menacing. There aren't many weapons, but they each feel different and purposeful. The areas in the demo aren't large but they are interesting. Most importantly though, I just love playing it! I could and probably will sit and play the challenge mode for hours on end over the coming months. Sure it has bugs, but for a pre-alpha demo it's suprisingly well put together. The challenge mode has same appeal of UberMosh or old school Unreal Tournament to me. Jump in a challenge on hard for just a couple matches after work to destress and see how well you do.\n\nI can't wait until the full game is released, certainly this is one for any Descent fan to be excited about!","March 14","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This was my first 6DX (I think that's what it's called) game.  I was very pleased with the game and how it played out.  I am very interested to see where this will go from here, but I do see a few faults to the game.  We'll talk about that later.\n\nAlso, before we get into the review, the buttons on the mouse sensitivity options don't work (had to use keyboard).\n\nPros:\n\n-Fun\n-DOOM-esque atmosphere (I like)\n-DOOM-esque gameplay elements such as health and weapon pickups (works to the game's advantage)\n-Good weapon variety for what we were given\n-Solid gameplay\n-Interesting enemy variety\n\nCons:\n\n-Confusing map layout\n-Music tends to repeat and sound the same (no offense to the composer)\n-Doesn't really seem to matter if you roll around.  It's more advantageous to stay in one position and don't use Q or E (default)\n-Enemies look the same with the exception of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with the sawblade (NERF PLOX, DPS TOO HIGH)\n-No real manuverability options other than moving side to side and up and down.\n-Feels...repetitive and like I don't have a real goal (I forgot what I was doing in "Reactor Destroy").\n-Floaty camera movement.  It's weird as ♥♥♥♥.\n\nOpinions and Suggestions:\n\n-Art style doesn't seem to fit the current mood of the game.  Given what I just played, I feel like a more simplistic art style might have worked better for this sort of game, though it's up to you.  I enjoy what I got.\n-Minimap.  Doesn't have to display enemies and it doesn't have to be highly detailed.  A top-down view of a grid based map would be alright with me.\n-Less claustrophobic spaces please.\n-The DOOM music fits the CURRENT mood of the game, but I'd like a little bit more variety rather than just techno all the way through.  May I suggest either a rock or orchestra (if you can afford it of course) cover during boss battles?\n-Speaking of boss battles, if you don't think your game is going to be memorable, I suggest making crazy-awesome boss fights.  Something like how Metal Gear Rising Revengence did in their boss fights.  Crazy, over the top, and just plain awesome.  May I suggest: Giant Spaceship with multiple pieces that you have to individually damage that will, over time, break off to reveal a large reactor that you'll have to destroy to beat the boss?\n-A default melee weapon or option would be nice.  DOOM had fists and a chainsaw.  I'd like...oh I don't know, "ramming"?  Actually, that sounds pretty useful.  Gives the boost ability a little more strategic worth.\n-Sawblade enemy is an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ (in a good way).\n-Can combat be a little bit faster?  Seems slow.\n-Hard mouse movement.  I'd like the camera to stop when I stop my mouse.\n\nFinal thoughts:\n\nIt's a good teaser.  I would rather recommend a complete product though.  I'd tell people to try this game out and see if they like it.  I would also recommend it to people who want to try out this genre.  This would be a good starting point.  It's not crazy difficult but is still hard enough for you to enjoy.\n\nI'm looking forward to the final product.  Good luck.\nSadly, I won't be able to assist you with funding though.","March 9","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A lot of the same weapons are back, just with different names, and even the challenge mode was fun. I'm not one to do stuff just for nostalgia's sake, but this teaser demo thing totally had the spirit of Descent.\n\nNow that said, it's been like 15 years or so since then. They don't need to just make a new Descent without any new features. In fact, this was like Descent 1 in features, whereas Descent 2 and 3 had the fantastic Guidebot and the robot that steals your crap and you have to fly after it (I totally remember that brown and green creep!). They need to put modern sensibilities in this game to make it truly shine. Don't just "do Descent" again. Make a far better Descent. Certainly there are new features they have been thinking of over all these years that they can implement with today's tech.\n\nAnyway, this is a free demo, and I recommend it. Quite nice! Very short, though, unless you play the challenge mode repeatedly, which is just infinite bots spawning in but far more fun that I thought it would be since that's not really my kind thing.","March 12","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Old school Descent fan boy here.  Tried out Descent Underworld first.  I found that game ok but didn't really get the Descent feel of it.
