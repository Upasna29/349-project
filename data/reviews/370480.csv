You play as a lone pixel that has to make friends and recruit others to build up a bigger pixel that is capable of defending you against and shooting other enemies. It sounds simple but as you progress into the game it ramps up the challenge, the game has 6 difficulty modes as well as the option to replay invidiual bosses or a chance to fight them all in Boss Rush.\n\nGameplay is pretty simple here, you move around the screen and collect other pixels that attach to you and upgrade your size/abilities. Though the bigger your ship is the more danger you're likely to be in as dodging things can be a bit tough (especially on the harder difficulties). It's a bit like Tetris mixed with something like Geometry Wars, gameplay can be fast paced and satisfying. You also have a Local Co-op mode that lets you and a friend make your own pixels to battle stages and fight bosses together.\n\nPlenty of different types of enemies in each stage, you also have a visual theme to each level that brings a treat as you progress to another one. Graphically the game is quite simple but it's surprisingly effective at delivering a great experience.\n\nThe soundtrack is quite a treat, I did enjoy the music in the game and often felt myself lost in the music that even cost me a couple of deaths! Might even be something you'd enjoy listening to on your phone/outside the game.\n\nIt's a refreshing experience to the bullet hell genre and something I'd be happy to recommend, there is plenty here to do and the game has around 129 achievements for the completionists out there. If you're a fan of games like Geometry Wars then you'll enjoy this.","October 2, 2015","true","5.4"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","17","17","0","0"

This becomes rather difficult as if they easily kill you as one hit and you're done for.\n\nDue to this you really need to acquire as many pixels as possible as they need to be your shields, and get destroyed. You can also rotate yourself so you're able to try and balance out the pixel build up. It's gets very awkward if you have a mass of them on one side, and nothing else where.\n\nBoss battles are intense, as they're packed heavily and have a massive arsenal. In order to advance each difficulty you must destroy them, which is no easy task.\n\nI strongly recommend using a controller for this one, I found it much easier with an analog stick.\n\nThe game may be very plain looking, but the music is great and certainly adds more to the game. I honestly think it would be rather boring without it.\n\nIf you're sensitive to any lights I would advise avoiding the game though. There's a lot of different colours on some levels and quite a bit of flashing.\n\nPC Gameplay\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKcSKmTF6LM","October 2, 2015","true","1.1"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

The color scheme changes regularly throughout, and you can tell thought was put into the different color schemes.\n+Boss battles are fun!\n+Enemy formations/waves are fun and are visually interesting. You can tell that the waves are handcrafted (or at least it seems that way), and it's nice that the wave order seems to be partially random, so that the different difficulties aren't exactly the same every time you play them.\n+Enemy/abilities stay interesting. I kept running into new enemies as I got to each new difficulty level, which in turn are new abilities for the player if you are able to run into them to convert them to your side.\n+Slick presentation, menus are pretty nice.\n\nCons:\n-Can get a little hectic at times. Readability is pretty good, but the game can get so hectic that it can still be hard to tell what's what. I think that's the kind of game it is, though, as you are able to pick up a lot of fodder/shield enemies so that you won't die immediately.\n-When facing a boss, sometimes I would have barely survived to get to the boss, meaning that I wouldn't have much to shoot the boss with. There are still some enemies spawned during the bosses, but it sometimes felt like I could barely get any weapons to fight him with. Not sure how you fix this problem, though, since more shooting enemies would make the boss fight even more difficult.","October 2, 2015","true","0.7"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","0"

(I personally really like the aesthetic the game presents)\n\nI played the game using an XOne Controller mainly (Keyboard works fine, but I still recommend a pad) and the analog support is nice. You can use the stick to move either slowly or fast depending on the need. That extra control is always great to see.\n\nThe bosses I've encountered so far have been quite different from each other and each interesting in their own way.\n\nOh, and if there are too many bullets, that you might be thinking, you can't dodge them, just turn your ship 90 degrees and maybe the angle you're at now might dodge them :)\n\nAll-in-all a surprisingly interesting game and will probably keep me interested for hours to come. If you like games in the genre, then definitely give this one a spin.\n\n\nMy preview of the game:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f-Jpscyneg","October 2, 2015","true","3.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Well that's basically what Pixel Galaxy is with bright colors, a strong soundtrack, and lots of challenging fun.\n\nYou see in this pixelated space world, you start off as a single pixel, and if you get hit, well that single pixel gets hit, its game over, lights out, please try again. Here's the interesting thing though, its not all about dodging all that could destroy that single pixel. You see if you time it right the other pixels that might have appeared as foes can become part of you.\n\nThat's right, as you play through the levels you will have the chance to touch pixels that are moving, or perhaps are stationary on the screen, and in this action you can add them to you. Doing this will, hopefully, build a barrier of expendable pixels between damage and your starting, single pixel.\n\nYou will be faced with varying levels of difficulty, and of course which each higher difficulty new things will open up for you to play against. New bosses will test your skill, and you will definitely need to be fast at dodging while hopefully holding on to pixels that can shoot so that you can return fire.\n\nI highly recommend that you play this game with a gamepad, there's something about controlling the pixel, or the collection of pixels with the left analog that just feels so natural. There's also the ability to rotate with the triggers, something that you are going to want to master so that you can evenly disperse your collection of pixels, be able to aim a bit better, and of course protect the starting pixel from damage.\n\nThis is the type of game that I never had an issue with coming back and playing some more. There's always that chance that I will man up and try to take on the next level of difficulty, and of course after getting my ♥♥♥ kicked I'll jump into a lower difficulty, kick some ♥♥♥, and once again feel really good about myself.\n\nThis is a challenging game that has quite a few layers to it, and unique experiences each time as how the pixels come out each time are random, which I have to say I both love and hate. I love because that means no two games are alike, but I hate because I can't learn through repetition to find the best solution. In the end though I think I'd much rather have the unique gameplay than the repetition which I could possibly burn out on.\n\nIf you are looking for something a little different, spacey, and pretty easy to pick up, you're going to want to add this game to your collection, there's no question that this should be a game that everyone should take for a spin. This game gets a 9.2 out of 10.","November 18, 2015","true","1.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

At its core the game is a "bullet hell" shooter where you start out as a single pixel. From there more pixels race on to the screen, some of them shooting (lots of) bullets at you. If you can dodge the plethora of bullets and run into the pixel firing at you then that pixel is added to you. The more pixels you get the bigger you are. These new pixels may even fire bullets to take out other pixels and add protection for you, the core pixel. But this also means you are less nimble and will get hit by more bullets. Keep this up and take out one of the numerous bosses and you may unlock the next difficulty level. Since I suck I have only unlocked easiest and easier. I still have easy, normal, normaler and normalest to unlock along with boss rush where you are bombarded with the bosses you have seen. Finally, if you have a someone close by, there is local co-op for two pixels versus the world.\n\nThere are two main things that I enjoy about this game. One, it is short. I don't always have a lot of time to play my games, so something that I can play is less then 5 minutes is welcome. Although I don't think I have ever actually played a round that lasted even that long. Second is, even on the same difficulty you never play the same exact level twice. The enemy abilities change as do their attack patterns. It makes for an entertaining game. If you enjoyed games likes Galaga then this would be right up your alley.","October 20, 2015","true","0.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The shooting is passive and totally dependent on the blocks you collect: if you collect a block that shoots one shot a second, your ship will now shoot one extra shot a second from that block.  You can then destroy blocks with your uncontrollable firepower (including the blocks you are trying to add to your ship).  When you die, you can instantly restart which is great, and the game can be really addicting.\n\nWhere it falls apart for me is the areas between boss fights.  You have about 90 seconds of various blocks coming into the screen and firing on you until you get to a boss fight.  I wish that could be cut down to 45 seconds instead to focus more on the boss fights.  It is very difficult, and your 60 block ship can fall apart in an instant if unlucky.  It does not help that the screen can be covered in bullets while the ship feels relatively slow.  However, the most enjoyable part of the game is fighting the bosses.  I just wish I could fight all the bosses in the colosseum (where you can time trial fight a boss) from the very beginning, but you cannot until you come across each boss individually in the game and beat it.  The bosses are tied to the difficulty setting, which means you cannot just grind away on easy to unlock them.  So the higher I get in difficulty, the less time I get to spend with the bosses, and it just burned me out.","January 12","false","1.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Unfortunately, it's a few design decisions away from being a fun game. Non-shmup fans will probably not enjoy it. Shmup fans can find better.\n\nThe music is great, though.","November 27, 2015","false","3.8"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

I wouldn't call it 100% addicting, it CAN get annoying at times :P\n\nBut yes... I would recommend the game! Why? Because it's an "Addicting time waster!"","March 6","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Music and graphics are very catchy. Only issue is that you don't get much warning when the boss arrives, and often they enter the screen where you are and obliterate you instantly which is really frustrating.","January 12","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It may look simple enough, however, Pixel Galaxy throws a ton of stuff at you and it’s really tough to figure out where you are at times all the while it’s also hard to figure out which pixels are possible friendlies sometimes. At one point I felt I was probably killing more buddies than baddies. Pixel Galaxy is neat and fun and while I feel it may not super amazing, it’s fun enough that fans of the genre should pick it up for sure.","May 8","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
