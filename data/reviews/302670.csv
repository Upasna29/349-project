They started out with a template that was very successful and have been tweaking it into a new game that offers different tactical options for the players to consider.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe good:\n\n\n1)  When I first played I enjoyed it so very much.  I could watch modern day soldiers fight and try to survive without me telling them to do simple things like "duck behind cover when 50 dudes are shooting at you!"  The AI of each soldier knew to do that better than any previous incarnation of the MoW series.\n\n2)  All the old goodies from the MoW series were part of the game.  Cooking grenades, stances for soldiers to stand, crouch or lay prone.  Accuracy modifiers stances as well as using cover.  The damage models of soldiers seem to be carried over as well.  It's a good system and works great for this game.  Love it.\n\n3)  Very stable game with a few eceptions.  Many of the MoW games have been plagued with OOS and disconnection issues.  Players dropping out of the game mid battle isn't something you have to worry about with this game.\n\n\n\n\nThe Bad:\n\n1)  Units are locked by level.  Nobody likes it.  The developer has stated that they give players the tools they need to win with basic squads and only elite squads are locked.  This is a half truth.  The elite squads do have better stats but there are a few that are totally unique, such as the grenadier squad that has rifle grenades that can shoot soldiers who are behind cover.  There is no basic unit that can do that.\n\n2)  Vehicles have wacked out damage models atm.  I'm sure they'll be fixed but it's game breaking to see a 6P50 technical snipe a humvee with twice the armor halfway across the map when the humvee needs to be at least half that distance to even damage the pickup truck that has no visible armor whatsoever.  When vehicles were introduced the game balance was thrown way off.\n\n3)  If you have no control points then your soldiers have no way to re-supply their ammo.  None.  To me this is giving the winning player even more advantage and seems a bit silly.  Also Anti-Tank infantry cannot resupply at all.  Once their rockets are used they are officially rifle soldiers and you have to BUY another Anti-Tank squad if  you need more tank busting done.\n\n\n\nThe ugly:\n\nAll the players who loved MoW loved the Direct Control feature.  It's what made the game unique and made the game amazing to play.  It's a feature that no other RTS game has matched thus far.  Unfortunately it's also a feature that's being chopped up and sold as a lame imitation of it's former self.  When players who have supported the game cried out that they wanted back the feature that makes the game fun for them they are told that they are abusing god mode mechanics that give an unfair advantage.  Nobody agrees with this.  It does however take time to learn the Direct Control system and that is something that casual players do not like to do, invest time.\n\nIt would seem that the developer is catering to the casual crowd that loves facebook games and hello kitty.  They have told the old school hardcore player base who love the gritty gameplay that they're no longer  important in the CtA universe.  The playerbase that is important is the kind that blows huge chunks of cash on simplified games that have no depth whatsoever.  This guy bought (A)?  Ok buy (Anti-A).  He bought (B)?  Ok buy (Anti-B).  No more using skill to beat the odds, it's just a point and click adventure where you sit back and watch the show while giving vague orders to soldiers who can only perform one duty.\n\n\n\nIn it's current state I cannot recommend this game.  It could be something amazing if the developer listened to the community about what they do and do not like.  However they simply add features in and refuse admit when those features are bad for the game.  This is a red flag for me.  It is a red flag for many others as well.  The player base went from 900+ online playing in multiplayer games to 180.  Whatever their vision for the game may be the fact remains that nobody wants to play a game that has dead multiplayer.  Nobody.\n","August 16, 2015","false","27.8"," 163 of 203 people (80%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","80","163","203","7","13"

Units are unlocked by level. This means that players just starting out are at a disadvantage to more experienced player not only because of the lack of experience but also because they do not have the same selection of units available to them. This just makes the learning curve even steeper. I'm not quite sure what the developers were thinking. That would kind of be like playing chess with one side having all the pieces while the newcomer only gets pawns.\n\nTo those that say the one can simply play against bots: It doesn't make sense that one should have to skirmish against bots for 20+ hours to gain "experience". Bots don't play like people do, and if one thinks it is going to make one better at the game, then one is quite foolish. As far as changing parameters? Why have parameter to restrict access to begin with? The community isn't that large to begin with so all this does is make it less likely newcomers will stay when they are fighting against veteran players. What does it add to the mulitplayer experience? Eugen had this for Wargame: European Escalation, but then figured out that it was moronic and dropped it in the later two games.","November 7, 2015","false","7.8"," 135 of 176 people (77%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","77","135","176","5","10"

It has a well done AI for those who do not compete well in online matches like myself. The AI is actually a challenge on the higher levels and the game provide a small variety of maps. The small amount of time I have put into the game already feels well worth it.  Sadly there is only two faction as of now and it does seem the team is interested in making an addition to the faction but nothing was set in stone.\n\nThe game has a test feature which I find is always over looked, It often causes crashes due to a overload of units but it is fun to experiment with all the units.\n\nMost of the voice overs are ripped straight from the previous games much like a couple sounds but so far the new sounds are fantastic and show great promise. I have only seen infantry combat and I believe that is all that is in the game as of now but this was enough to justify my purchase. This game shows great potential, this phrase can often ward of suspicious purchasers but this is a well done Early Access game. Little to no bugs and a very good showcase of what's to come.\n\nThe graphics are very well done, some people are concerned this is a reskin but it looks like custom models and meshes have been done and that those comments are more anger than truth. The game modes are pretty familiar but the game does feel different.\n\nThe third person mode works like a charm, like in men of war you are able to seamlessly transition and use the mechanic as much as you need.\n\nThe guns and weapons feel a lot stronger, people die quicker and the game feels a lot less forgiving. In men of war charging right into a bunker and clearing it was a possibility, not in Call to Arms however. The enemy will kill your entire squad if you are not positioned right. Sometimes this gets annoying but it is realistic and great for strategy. Long range engagements can last for a long time and I feel this really sets the games mood and gives you or the enemy the ability to use it as a distraction.\n\nThe inventory system is a basic rip from the men of war system but there is no blame. It is a good system that works flawlessly, along with the highlighting bodies and weapons hot keys/mechanic.\n\nI am unsure if the price is justified in its current state for people who are no hardcore fans but I believe in my own bias way that in its current state I made a wise purchase even if the game wasn't finished.\n\nThe implementation of Workshop already is fantastic and people haven't waited to start adding new thing to the game.\n\nThe tools to adapt the game are superb and if you owned any previous games by the devs you know what to expect, a quality and proffesional map editor.\n\nI have made several videos of the game which you can find here if you are still undecided: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzExFRZtGr851dUhdp6NbRirfhqIOczRm","July 31, 2015","true","31.0"," 107 of 142 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","107","142","0","2"

The experience i've had with it are buggy, it crashes on start up 60% of the time, and it feels like im playing a pre alpha when it's expected to leave Early Access in Q3 2016. Theres problems in the game itself in which I see it as a way to keep players playing the game by making you earn XP to use troops in each faction. Which is pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ as theres the moment when you play with a higher level player and you get stomped when he pulls out a tank that you haven't even unlocked yet. This is completely unfair for those who start out, and the majority of the community from i've seen has been against it. Unless theres a way to disable it which I haven't seen.

But the levelling system is completely bullcrap like others have mentioned. I rarely play offline as I don't have the time, mostly I like jumping in to my own customized battles quickly in skirmish during office lunch breaks and just have fun blasting tanks off. But the locked units seriously turns you off.\n\nI know this is Early Access, and I hope the levelling unlock unit mechanism would change.

To say it is close to beta is a farcry from reality. Please, for the rest of us reading these reviews, no need to proclaim "Satan is out to scam us again!" I see it too much, arrogant reviews about how a game is lacking large amounts of content. "It's like this game's in Alpha stage or something, sheesh!"\n\nSingleplayer (Deluxe Package):\n-2 missions\n-showcases basic vehicle/infantry combat\n-very short lacking story elements\n-custom missions are becoming available already\n\nMultiplayer:\n-Idk about anyone else, but I'm having the usually horrible online issue of stuttering around @ 60 FPS\n-handful of good maps (all at night o.o) to mess around on\n-Infantry only as of now\n-BOTS!! (a huge selling point for me)\n\nEditor:\n-Almost as fun as the base game\n-Includes several units the Singleplayer/Multiplayer doesn't to mash together in giant battles\n\nGeneral:\nCompared to AS2, the game has been cleaned up quite a bit. Textures, effects, sounds, etc. have been improved quite a bit. Inventories (ammo especially) are being handled quite differently. Vehicles seem to have thicker skin this time around, being able to withstand a shaped charge or two. Infantry status plays a much larger role now it seems. Specialized troops will wipe the floor with regulars. All in all, I am enjoying what I paid for. $30 is a lot for a deluxe edition in its current state, but we must remember that price is not only for what the game entails now. It is for the finished product the developers are advertising us. A product that I have no doubt will be top quality.","August 3, 2015","true","20.9"," 59 of 83 people (71%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","71","59","83","7","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/For7une/recommended/302670/","For7une","Fortune","http://steamcommunity.com/id/For7une/","144 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nFirst, let's address a central question that may or may not be in your mind as you're reading this review.\n\nCTA = MOWAS2 reskin?\n\nEffectively, yes.  The sounds of guns, tooltips of weapons, hints and tips in loading screens, UI, font choices for events (vehicle hull damaged/destroyed, penetrating hit, exp tickers when achieving kills etc), direct control of infantry and vehicles and the overall functionality of game mechanics are identical.\n\nSo what gives?  To preface my actual review of the game and its content in terms of pros and cons (I mostly play RTS games and have racked up a few ten thousand hours across varying franchises), I'd like to open up a bit further about the whole Call to Arms / Men of War Assault Squad 2 mess.\n\nAs you may or may not be aware, MOWAS2's development issues, while layered in part to incompetence from staff, can also be explained by the Ukraine Crisis, as a part of the development team were Ukrainians and, one of the main publishers of Men of War in the past has historically been a Russian company.  MOWAS2 is virtually unsupported today, and even during active development it was very apparent that the game did not build upon MOWAS1 in any way.  To me, a humble consumer, MOWAS2 seemed like a blatant cash-grab.  Mind you, I'm not a veteran of the MOWAS franchise, so I can largely forgive the nature of its development as I assumed the game would be developed past a certain point.  It was not.\n\nCTA blumbered out of no where and was in part funded by crowdsourcing.  The daily playercount as far as the consumer is concerned is from 40 to 50 people, with a spike of perhaps 15 people online at once (oh boy.)\n\nThat was the preface, now on to the review of the product itself:\n\nCall to Arms is topical, it features a fictional arab fighting force (GRM) which you'd be forgiven for mistaking for ISIS, and a Gulf War era US military, though without Javelins.\nWhen considering multiplayer versus play (1v1, 2v2, 3v3, 4v4) the game's pacing takes place in 3 stages:\n\nInfantry,\nMechanized,\nHeavy mechanized.\nEach of these stages lasts roughly 5-7 minutes, so your average game should not take past 20 minutes no matter the size, as the amount of resources given per player is a fixed amount (boring, in my opinion) and after incurring X losses you just stop getting income, period.\n\nThere are no heavier tanks past the Bradley, BMP-3 and Stryker MGS, though the fact they want to implement the Abrams is almost painfully obvious.  AT Weapons are limited to the RPG-7, LAW and AT-4 rocket launchers.\n\nThis is where any original ideas end.  The rest of the game and its mechanics are familiar to anyone who has played more than 5 hours of the MOWAS franchise, which is a let-down.  There are 2 arguments that are popular to excuse this fact, first:  "It's only 20 dollars!" and second "It's in Alpha!"\n\nTo the first point, 20 dollars is a nice price.  It's genuinely what this game is worth if you intend on purchasing it.  To say that it's "only" 20 dollars is like saying that a cheeseburger is "only" 1 dollar - is it a bargain?  Or is it just the maximum amount of money the producer can ask without being scoffed at, at this point?\n\nTo the second, and this is funny, CTA is actually more stable and better streamlined than AS2, which is just bizarre to me.  This 20 dollar title is better polished during Alpha, than MOWAS2 ever was after years of development.  I'd love to give CTA the benefit of the doubt in terms of developmental stage but I highly doubt it will ever become more stable than it already is.\n\nPros\n\n- It's a cheeseburger, good value\n- More stable than the platform used to develop it (Assault Squad 2)\n- Better balanced overall in terms of infantry small arms, penetration values of AT Weapons and vehicles\n\n\nCons\n\n- Its a cheeseburger, not a filet mignon\n- Already has achieved its full potential minus 1 or 2 units prefaction, and it's in "Alpha"\n- A few desynch-inducing bugs\n- Tiny community\n- No new creative thought, it's same old mechanics with a new narrative\n- Elite infantry are far too good, infantry AI is detrimentally bad\n\nCTA relies on its multiplayer component for replay value, without a community this replay value does not exist.  While I would like to recommend the game based purely on the fact that it's stable, relatively balanced and rewards skill and tactics (but only to a certain point, sadly, especially the BTR-80 can wipe out infantry armies in seconds at long distances), I cannot recommend it based on the fact it does not have enough players to give you, the customer, any reasonable replay value.\n\nThis game needs around 10,000 active, daily players to be able to deliver what it promises.  However, due to being a MOWAS game and therefore having a learning curve that requires patience, it does not seem to have a very good retention rate for players.  People tend to buy the game, try it for 10 hours, and then never looking at it again so sales figures are deceptive.\n\nShould you buy it?  If you're a MOWAS fan and want to support the developer, yes.\nIf you're an RTS fan who's looking for a new game to dedicate to, create content (YouTube, Twitch) or be part of a community, this is not the game for you.","October 18, 2015","false","48.3"," 73 of 107 people (68%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","68","73","107","6","1"

In the future, that rating will likely be even higher. If you like reading, go ahead and read my "comprehensive" review about the main aspects of this game. Keep in mind, I'm just a dude who played the game and want to tell potential buyers about it. I'm not a professional critic in any sense, so technical or in-depth analysis will not really be included in this review.\n\nOk, I am going to start this review with what I believe is one of this game's greatest strengths; the modelling. The models for the units and vehicles are perfectly made, being both accurate and well polished. The American infantry alone is enough to make me stop and say, "that is badass." Everything is accurate from camo to gear. Infantry and vehicles on both sides just look amazing and there's really nothing else to say. They really do astonish me.\n\nAs with any game on this engine, the GEM editor is included. This allows VERY indepth editing for scenarios or fun. CtA stands out with its access to the Steam Workshop, so scenarios can be shared and downloaded instantly. This makes this game have endless scenarios and the mod support is great. I expect there to be many great mods on the workshop for this game.\n\nThe online for this game is easy to access, and when paired with CtA's user friendly menu, a player can seamlessly move from tab to tab. Joining a game with friends or strangers is fast and very simple to do. Nothing is confusing about the online mode or the menus.\n\nOne thing I have noticed in other reviews is people complaining about the "American bias". This is absolutely not true in this game. The sides are completely balanced, but have different strengths. The USA's strengths are strong infantry and vehicles that are very effective but cost a lot. The GRM has a different approach. They have weaker infantry and vehicles but they bring on the pain just as much as the Americans by coming in large numbers for low prices. This difference between the play style of the factions adds a lot of diversity to this game. It is another great aspect that makes this game stand out from its competitors.\n\nOnce in game, the objectives are simple and you always know what you're trying to do. Combat is very good in this game, as it offers unique combined arms combat. Infantry can support vehicles and vice versa. Tactics are important and the AI is very competent (for the most part). Explosions run rampant in the later game, and this engine's unique destructibility allows buildings and vehicles to be blown apart or run over in a very realistic fashion. HE rounds can blow holes in walls, sending the building's occupants running. It's a very neat experience.\n\nThe new sounds give incredible immersion. They environments have great ambient noises and the new vehicle sounds are just plain menacing. The gun sounds are still relatively average, but almost all of the sounds in this game go above and beyond and immerse you into the battle.\n\nThe maps in this game are just awesome and highly detailed. They provide dynamic combat and allow for some daring maneveurs and flanks. The map makers created something that is immersive, beautiful and functional as a battle arena. They vary in size, region and climate and the units respond to these changes in changes of camoflage. They are a definite strength to this game, and even if you hate the maps currently in the game (which you won't), you can even create your own in the editor.\n\nOne thing I would like to point out is this game's direct control mode that sets it apart from its competitors. It even sets it apart from MoW. When in direct control of a vehicle, the camera immerses you, giving you a 3rd person view of the battle through its eyes. Zoom in and you're looking through a gun port, ready to engage the enemy. Infantry camera angles don't differ much from MoW, but in the editor a first person mode is available. This is a neat mode, but the clipping of the soldier's weapon makes it a little disappointing. It also can't be accessed in an actual game, so it's uses are small.\n\nThe ingame UI is great and user friendly. The map tells you everything you need to know and is a very useful tool when in direct control of a unit. It's all very simple, but allows for complex actions. It looks great, as with most aspects of this game.\n\nThe development team seems competent and dedicated. They are very vocal and are well connected with the players. This is great for this game as it allows for the players to have a say in what the developers work on.\n\nSo far, I've mostly talked about what I like about this game. Currently, it has only a few problems, most of which can be fixed by adding new units and unit types. There are no gamebreaking problems or bugs but I'm nit-picky, so here's a few small complaints:\n\n(Devs fixed resupplying vehicles problem)\n\n(Devs are taking action to improve game modes mentioned)\n\nA problem I have noticed many people complain about is the voice acting. The voice acting is ripped straight from MoW. While this is a problem, keep in mind this game is early access. Voice acting comes later. The developers are likely focused on new maps, new vehicles and new game modes, things that we can all agree are more important than voice acting. The voice acting isn't bad at all anyway, it's just repetitive hearing the exact same shouts we heard from MoW. This is completely negligable anyway, because the voices aren't really noticed a whole lot when your in combat.\n\nThe rest of the problems I have with this game are mostly about lacking units and vehicles. Currently, it has all of the units and vehicles required to play, but it doesn't really have a whole lot of diversity with its vehicles. There are Humvees and Technicals, Strykers and BTRs, Bradleys and BMPs and some tank options. All of them have one or two alternate types that have different features like TOW missiles or more armor. The vehicles this game is currently missing are vehicles like transport trucks, "heavy recon" vehicles like MRAPs or MAT-Vs (the addition of those would be ridiculously awesome), and it is also missing static weapons. Long ranged artillery, whether it be fixed or tracked is missing from this game as it only offers hand held mortars and rifle grenades for artillery. Static heavy MGs or AT weapons (tripod based) are missing, so if you want a static AT weapon, you will have to buy an entire vehicle and make it hold in a position. The addition of static weapons would be critical, and provide new defensive abilities to the player for modes like Domination or Evacuation. Air vehicles, while they are modelled and in the game, are not accessible while in a match, should be implemented. This would add a whole new level to the combat, literally.\n\nThis game is very, very good. It's the game I have been looking for since I started playing MoW many, many years ago. It's modelling and maps provide a beautiful and immersive experience which is perfectly paired with awesome lighting, great combat and exeptional destructability.

I think there may be a policy breech as there is no description or disclaimer as to why you have the pay an additional $5 over the price of the deluxe edition or that there is no SP content in the base version.

The game can be tricky to learn if you're new to the Mow series but once you get to playing the game more over time you will understand how to play the game. Despite some people and their opinions, I believe in this game. So far there are two Factions in the game the United States of America and the Global Revolutionary Movement that both specialize in their own styles of play. Also would like to point out the hate on the game ATM on how small the Online battles are people you have to realize that Modern battles arent fought with numbers like WW2 anymore its fought with technology and skilled small units.

I decided why not get it cause it looked great for a EA game. Turns out I was wrong...\n\nNo single player, the quality of everything is poor compared to the videos I've seen (it's lagging even when I play a set up bot game), lag is everywhere from graphics to characters, the sound quality is worse then I saw in video, and although it claims 70 something people were in game, there was less then 12 people on the 'internet' with one game that I couldn't play in cause no one joins. Essentially what you see in the video here is what you get, but in a much much poorer quality. If I wanted to play something like this I'd just go play Company oh Heroes, the first game - it at least doesn't lag all the time and the quality is still much better.\n\nI don't like giving bad reviews, I believe I avoided ever doing so. But I can't help it as I feel I wasted money on this game. I was so disapointed between the videos I've seen and the few games I could actually play that I felt I had to make a review warning that quality of gameplay is nothing like in video; what you should expect is is older graphics, bad voice acting, and a super laggy everything. I honestly don't know what I wasted more of, my time or cash - guess time since I will be seeking a refund if possible (I've never tried before so im not sure if I can even get one for EA games, guess we'll see).\n\nAdditionally. I forgot to mention that the last game I tried to enjoy lagged at one pan (I just tried to move over to another zone under attack) and the game frooze causing a massive crash of the game giving me a radical error message.

Was it worth it even while it was on sale? No. Maybe it will be at a later phase, but not right now. Barebones is what this game is as of late, might as well get MoW Assault Squad 2 and mod it.\n\nEDIT -\nIt's still not really worth it. The new menu they've implemented seems cool, but it's actually quite confusing. It took me ten minutes just to find the exit button, which is dimmed in the upper right corner. You can call me blind but this can be a problem for other people as well. Singleplayer in my experience is still non-existant if you just buy the regular version of the game.\n\nThey've also made it so that it's quite difficult to play singleplayer skirmish. This again falls back to the crappy menu interface they have added. There is also the fact that YOU CANNOT play this game offline in my experience, since starting a singleplayer skirmish automatically boots you into an online lobby. Because it boots you into an online lobby, you cannot play while offline because it cannot create the lobby in the first place. I found this out a while ago when my internet went out for a few days, and I felt like playing this game. To my disappointment, I couldn't. Even if I could start a singleplayer game with internet, there is still the fact that I have to add a password to the lobby in order to prevent others from joining. It sounds easy once I've said it, but it was difficult for me to figure out when you combine it with the interface.\n\nAlso, unit locks.\n\nThat's it. Crappy menu interface, unit lock, inability to play offline (currently), and the difficulty to start a singleplayer game.

CtA is like many early access games out there that hasn't been fully finished yet where there's bound to be plenty of bugs & crashes here and there from time to time which is expected. But from what I can see so far from the several updates and patches to fix bugs, it seems like it's fully focusing on multiplayer so far and at the same time it's degrading every aspect of the general environment of the game itself. Game functions have been altered/changed without improving anything, they've been updating and adding/fixing issues but at the same time creating more problems and errors/crashes for the game, it's like when someone has a problem with their hand, they'll just cut it all off & add a prosthetic one on without finding a cure and it seems what they're kind of doing in a way.\n\nAgain, it is an early access game and many problems still needs to be solved by the help of gamers and such, but at the same time currently its not worth your 20 bucks on it unless you wanna pay to do the work for them in a sense. There's just not enough content currently in this game to be worth anyone to pay for it's price at all in my opinion,  even though I did right off the bat went for the Deluxe Edition for the SP experience, then again I only end up finding out you only get 2 Single Player missions and later only after patches and updates those missions become semi broken.\n\nSo conclusion is, if you got the extra bucks and wanna do the "pay to work" scheme then go ahead and get this game and help the creators find a ♥♥♥♥ ton of bugs and then report to them with minimal content to play with.

Oh and the AI have access to all units from the start.\n*Direct control has been changed to a third person view for vehicles, one that is barely functional for anything other than the new armoured warfare mode.\n*The casualization of the inventory system continues, the new AS2 supply system of magic supply points is here to stay, but with the added bonus of making helmets and body armour no longer something you can drop and pickup at will, and weapons now have all their ammo stored in the gun slot instead of having own slots for them.\n*The loading song is ear-grating, there are a lot of better "middle eastern style" songs that they could have picked..\n*The game is alot smaller, with only two confirmed factions with barely enough vehicles between them to make a decent MOW faction, combine this with what is usually very small maps focused on small squad combat, and you get a fraction of what you would get out of MOW/MOWAS1&2.\n*Single player missions are locked behind the "deluxe"-edition until the full release.\n\nBut hey, at least they added controller support..","January 11","false","41.1"," 35 of 55 people (64%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","64","35","55","4","2"

Very fluid run.\n\nLacking some content such as further vehicles and units, but it is to be expected for this EA.\n\nIf you have enjoyed any of the Men of War series...I strongly urge you to pick up this gem and support the EA, you will not be dissapointed.","August 8, 2015","true","1.2"," 34 of 56 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","34","56","0","0"

No, not in the slightest.\nWill it be worth it´s money? Maybe.\n\nI do play the Men of War series since Men of War 1. And since that very little has changed, especially the graphics haven´t since the release of Men of War back in 2009. Compare those screenshots, there are just a few changes, like higher tex resolution and bump maps.\n\nMen of War (2009)[images.bit-tech.net]\nCall to Arms[cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com]\n\n\nAnd for now the content is extremely limited and just some infantry squads were released which means that you will find much bigger variety in a mod for MoW:AS 2 called “Red Rising” which already has multiple factions (Germany, USA, ISIS, Russia and various other nations) and tanks such as the M1A1-M1A2 Tusk 2 and the T-72 with reactive Armour. And for now I have to admit that I prefer this mod for being much more detailed and already more realistic (because of more realistic firing ranges). But Call to Arms doesn´t really feel like it´s a step forward to new era of weapons and technology. It really feels like being stuck with an STG 44 and a body armour.\n\nSo will this be a good game? I am pretty sure it will, but charging 19,99€ for a tiny alpha and recycled systems which has been converted to a modern theme is ridiculous. Especially when there’s already a better mod around which has the same graphics fidelity and more content. Have a look and that screenshot:\n\nRed Rising Screenshot 1\nRed Rising Screenshot 2[lh3.googleusercontent.com]\n\nHere compare those two as well, they speak for themselves:\n\nUnits from Red Rising\nUnits from Call to Arms[www.digitalmindsoft.eu]\n\nAnd bear in mind this game is from the same publisher which charged 9,99€ for a proper Third person feature in Men of War: Assault Squad 2. And I rarely seen any later improvements on units with this publisher and developer.\n\nDecide for yourself if you want to support this.

This can be seen as a negative or a positive, some people like the high degree of control you can have over each of your units. Thankfully, I have noticed my men using grenades on their own accord more often, so thats a good thing! If the micro aspect turns you off, know that it can be negated by playing higher point games where you simply don't have the time to micro your soldiers. However, you will want to micro your valuable assets like heavy tanks, keeping them in cover while poking out to take a shot and then moving back into cover.\n\n-SOUND! Holy hell the voices are AWFUL! Gun sounds also need a lot of work.\n\n- If you didn't like Men of war games, this won't really change your mind. The units do feel quite more powerful however, and the factions play very differently from each other. For instance, each ragtag militia squad has several AKMs that have full auto capacity. You will see bullets flying much more often, and tracers everywhere! I am a fan of the changes.\n\n-NEEDS BOTS IN COMBAT / LAST STANDING MODE.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BirdCute/recommended/302670/","BirdCute","BirdCute","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BirdCute/","1507 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nCall to Arms is a Real Time Strategy military game. For an Early Access game, it already shows a lot of promise. I find it similar to Victory Command, which is better known as it was free for some time on Steam.\nIf this review is too long for you, I suggest you to only read the first paragraph about the game's content and the final verdict at the end.\n\nWhat is happening in the game:You have to control your units in order to beat other teams. You are slowly gaining point and with these points, you can buy soldiers, armoured vehicles and other units.\n\nPros:    There are already quite a few games like this one, but this one does not fail impressing me. The commands are easy to figure out, the whole setup is clear and you shouldn't find it hard to get into the game. This is really good for attracting new players (and making them stay, of course).\nI don't usually rank the Options menu that high in my reviews, but the quantity of things you can set is amazing. You can change values of pretty much anything when it comes to video, audio and controls.\nYou can play singleplayer (with a little trick) and multiplayer. Surprisingly, there is always a certain amount of people playing this game, so you won't be the only guy in an empty server, as it happens to some games with that level of recognisability.\nThe amount of tutorials is astonishing. There are more than 30 tutorials in several difficulties and about 40 tips to help you play.\nI love the music in this game. There are multiple tracks, from orchestra music to choirs and they really fit the whole war scenery.\nThe game is being regularely updated with maps, missions, bug fixes and improves. This is how an Early Access game should be developed!\nThere is also Workshop support for more maps and missions. If you are into that, you can also use the Editor that comes with the game.\nCons:    The replay menu is, well, broken. After clicking it, I get a critical error in a few seconds and the game crashes. I believe, however, that this will be fixed eventually and I will correct my review when this is fixed.\nThis has to be said: Store screenshots are not realistic. This is not how this game looks like.\nYou have to own the Deluxe Edition to get access to singleplayer missions right now. Since this game is in Early Access, it is a bad idea to restrict access to one of the integral parts of the game. This results in less people testing it and might lead to buggier final product. The singleplayer campaign will be unlocked for normal buyers, too, when the game is out of EA.\nThe final verdict:This is not a full product yet, but it is already filled with contend and fun. There is also workshop support for even more missions. The gameplay is filled with possibilities and it is very easy to learn. Despite having some bugs in Early Access, I definitely recommend this game for RTS fans.\n\nGreetings,\nBirdCute\n\nNote that my copy of this game was obtained for free for reviewing purposes. However, this did not affect the quality and objectivity of this review.\n---\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","August 26, 2015","true","5.6"," 46 of 80 people (58%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","58","46","80","4","0"

EDIT: A bunch of vehicles are now available in MP: humvees, armed pickups, strikers and btr-80s. Also they are not planning air vehicles for MP only for SP (this might change).\n\n-Deluxe Edition unlocks Single Player and the three SP missions available right now, with more missions being released during Early Access. Single Player will be available for everyone at the release.\n\n-If you don't want to play against other people, you can host games and play with bots, you will still gain XP.\n\n-You can create your own maps/mission with the GEM editor, identical with the one in previous DMS titles. The game has workshop support, a few custom maps and missions are already available to play.\n\n-Plenty of placeholders and missing features, everything you see is subject to change and it will be improved or replaced. You can check the Roadmap topic to read about the development schedule. Other factions may be added depending on the games success.\n\nBuy this game now only if you want to help the DMS make a better game. If you hate playing an incomplete game with bugs and what not, just wait for the official release (Q1 2016).\n\nIMPORTANT!\nCtA will feature a 3rd person view for vehicle direct control instead of the birds eye view perspective from the previous games. This feature was announced from the beginning (2013) and the devs are determined to make this change for CtA. They said they will release on official mod for the old direct control but it will not be in the game by default.","August 3, 2015","true","59.8"," 29 of 51 people (57%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","57","29","51","4","7"

It does indeed sound awesome and the gameplay is also pretty interesting. However, this game is still in alpha/beta-version and it has been like that since 2015. There are new updates every now and then but the main problem is still around, even after a year.\nNow, I am pretty damn sure that my rig is way above the required specs, but I have yet managed to play a full session without crashing, and this happens regurlarly.\nI open the game, edit my settings/vid options, insta-crash. Tried doing it again, but then bam! Another crash...\nI open the game in safe mode, then I find out that my vid settings did actually get saved for whatever reason. I then proceed to a skirmish match, plays for like 20-30 minutes then crash.\nI open the game in editor mode, access violation error crashes after a bit.\nAlmost reaching 2 hours, I immediately refunded the game.\n\nTLDR;\nThe concept is nice, but the game is horribly broken.\n\nMoWAS is way better than this.","May 28","false","1.5"," 21 of 36 people (58%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","58","21","36","2","0"

I first thought they would have it coexist together till they completly removed it for vehicles. I don't even think they had asked the opinions of the community first that were actually supporting them with money but they didn't get the thing they wanted for their money and some people can't even get  a refund which is really sad. I came to a conclussion that I wont be telling my friends to buy Call to Arms and I will not be saying it is a great game till they have put in our beloved Direct Control\n\nMy Opinion now: I think the game has made some good changes lately it is going to add more entities and it is adding some cool features. MP is starting too look fun too because a lot of people are buying CtA.

I'll repost a few things I discussed in Rokko's review's discussion section, the review that is currently at the top.\n\nThe old DC is still available! You have to click the button on the HUD, rather than press the Hotkey. In the bottom left corner there are four small boxes, stacked vertically: a skull and crossbones, a wooden crate, a blue/red man portrait, and an upward arrow type symbol (that is the top box). That last symbol is the direct control button.\n\nJust so everyone who hasn't played CtA yet is clear, the new direct control is the old one, but from a lower, fixed camera angle. That's about it. The idea is to make it harder to see enemies from across the map and hit them though multiple buildings when you wouldn't be able to see it in real life. It also gives the direct control a more action type feel. This is in keeping with the direction that CtA is moving as a whole with closer range infantry combat as the focus. There will be more additions to the new DC like a gun camera zoom mode, and no range limitations in DC to make up for the limited view. It will allow tank combat from a more realistic perspective, rather than the omnipotent, gods eye, hit everything from the old DC that was totally OP for people who were good at it. Keeping the old DC in would drive away new players for whom it is an awkward and somewhat ill-conceived system that gives too much of an advantage to veterans. In 4v4's I can cruise around the back half of the map with a GRM tier 2 AP technical and easily get a dozen Humvee kills with that one vehicle because I know how to use the old DC and the newer players don't. It is a game-breaking exploit that will drive away new players in frustration. Here's a thread where the developer covers their reasons for the change:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/302670/discussions/0/537405286661241101/\n\nTheir new style of DC is in development, whereas the old style is polished after many years. You can't know what the new DC will really be like on release, and it isn't fair to compare the alpha version of the new DC to the polished version of the old DC. It's not about liking the new DC as it is now, but appreciating that this is a new feature that will take time to get right, and that once they get it right they will phase out the old DC (a nice compromise I think).\n\nI can say the same for other missing features. As the road map on the CtA sticky covers, things like more vehicles, the inventory, menu, UI, HUD, more game modes, full single player campaigns, more multiplayer maps, voiceovers, animations, etc...are all in the process of being developed and changed. It's absurd to complain about missing features in an early access Alpha release where they straight up tell you that those features are not in yet, and even go so far as to give you a timeline for when they will be in:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/302670/discussions/0/530646080847272442/\n\nOn the whole, Call to Arms is an immense improvement on the Men of War formula. It focuses on intense infantry engagements, and emphasizes cover, flanking and actual tactics much more than previous MoW titles. The maps are tighter, more urban, and with much more thoughtful placement of abundant cover and positions to flank from. The graphics are better, and the overall feel is more visceral and engaging. I've enjoyed playing the multiplayer this past week more than perhaps any time playing MoWAS2. I just played a few rounds of assault squad for comparisons sake and was shocked at how lackluster it seemed. CtA is in early access Alpha and I'd already rather play it than assault squad.\n\nI'm writing this review because I know how important the top reviews are for a game to succeed, and how commonly people can be turned off of buying a game because of one internet troll's loud, ignorant complaining about something they don't understand and isn't yet fully implemented. I like the direction they are going, and I am excited for the eventual full release, and I would hate to see all that potential dashed to pieces because of low sales due to a few misconceived, negative reviews of the alpha version.\n","August 19, 2015","true","120.2"," 16 of 28 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","16","28","0","0"

It is now being billed as "3rd person experience" and frankly right now it is kinda meh.\n\nThe feature is not finished, so it is unfair to jump to any conclusions other than the Direct Control from games gone by in the series, is no more.\n\nThe game itself looks rather decent. It plays much like its cousin AS2. It simply has no content.\nThey haven't pushed any boundries at all.\nAerial units will not be featured in multiplayer at all. I am not sure what they will be able to do with them on a single player side of things, as of now they appear to be nothing more than a prop.\n\nThe maps all feel very redundant.

Maybe the development team can do something new with CTA that will revitalize the MoW style gameplay -However, I think they're going to try and preserve what they have in order to mirror what they believe is a 'winning' equation from the MoW franchise.\n\nNot everything is bad, and there have been some slight improvements that I'd like to highlight that really stand out for CtA:\n\n-Ammunition/Weapon management - Players no longer have to manage individual bandoleers/clips/belts of ammunition. Each weapon comes with a standard amount of ammunition that is automatically attached to the assigned weapon. This is a massive improvement over the old system, in which players were forced to manage weapons and their associated ammunition allotment by picking up individual clips of ammunition for their Soldiers.\n\n-Vehicle Control - When players toggle the direct-control mode of a vehicle, they are now seated directly behind the vehicle in a stationary, third person view that roates with the turret of the vehicle. I never enjoyed the direct control management of MoW - I was always torn between looking at my target and looking at my vehicle. The new system feels much better and handles like a 3rd person view, rather than whatever the old system was trying to be.\n\n-Depth of Field - This new graphical setting is a welcomed addition (also recently added to MoW) that improves performance, especially when utilizing the new direct-control mode.\n\nAgain, I think there are few improvements to the game, but nothing that would be considered ground breaking. I'm willing to toggle this review, considering the game is still early access - I just dont see this going anywhere different than MoW","January 1","false","43.6"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

I've played a bit of multiplayer (when I could find someone else who was playing) and spent some time in the single-player missions. This game is an attempt at a modern Men Of War, and does it well in some areas, but not so well in others. So far the campaign is a bit lacking and is prone to bugs/glitches, and in my experience (although limited) the multiplayer does not run very well. My recommedation for the average Steam member is to wait until a final product is released with all of the issues ironed out.

Being able to choose to command between one soldier and a whole unit is what makes this game unique, spreading your squad the way you like around objects out smarting your opponent. Also each soldier has his own amount and type of weapons u can use  which makes combat intense and unpredictabe. The speed of interaction between movement and combat makes the battles feel realistic. You can always control a soldier or vehicle in 3rd person if you wish to and use your aiming skills to defeat enemy units.

Will i be able to play this Digital Mindsoft title without suffering permanent eye damage? This and many more are the questions i will answer in this review.\n\nLet's begin with the lobby, a modern design that totaly doesnt look like every youtube tutorial on how to make buttons that don't have a plain color - really good looking. I especially like the loading bar in this game cause it does totaly not look like the Windows Vista taskbar - original design. At all does the UI feature some fancy features, just like the global chat where you can say "WTB GF" and pray for someone to answer your offer. Or you just look at the list of players who are online - sometimes it does even show when a developer is playing the game. It's realy nice to know that one of these VAC-banned gods is playing at the same time i do.\n\nNow about the gameplay, it mostly evolves arround beeing too low level to call in any units that can harm the enemy, or you get simply kicked out of lobbies for beeing too low level - maybe this new gameplay system is a bit hard to understand for the casual gamer, but as their CEO allready said, just go grind exp by killing bots! The bots are a good addition to the game, they mostly just throw infantry into your line of fire till you run out of ammo, what seems to be their primary tactic - really well implemented.\n\nAdditional features:\n-impenetrable T-80 front hull\n-helmets cannot fly away anymore when hit, because they are glued to the soldiers head now (big improvement!)\n-you may pay 23€ for this masterpiece!\n-there is an epochal ammount of -> 2 <- factions - that are enough to have a battle with -> 2 <- different factions fighting each other!\n\nNegative Aspects:\n-I can't give the developers more money for this masterpiece...\n\nEven though i have listed all these positive aspects, i really cannot recommend the game because the 9/11 DLC won't be free content - you will have to pay for it additonal 9.11€. :(","April 3","false","5.0"," 30 of 58 people (52%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","52","30","58","16","3"

I've played all MoW that there is so far and this CTA is very buggy one and far from completed. It does say that's it is in Beta state. But, again, as a player who played all MoW games and seeing same stuff from Assaut Squad here in CTA: animations, options, features, AI intelligence, User interface (even loading hints are from Assault Squad, you can even read about Bazooka, Piat Panzerschreck), 80% of stuff was transfered from previous games into this one. I can not say why is this game buggy and prone to CTD. Basically Call to Arms is a conversion mod with new vehicles and soldiers models. As a MoW fan, this game is very good and it is MoW with modern weapons, that is excellent, but game is just unstable and currently very average rated game. Beta or not, this game shouldn't be this unstable. Now If the dev team is very small, like 2-3 guys, than I have not complains.\n\nIn this state, Call to Arms is worth max 5€.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sunbrosupreme/recommended/302670/","Sunbrosupreme","Carl Hamilton","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sunbrosupreme/","219 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI recommend this game if you liked Men of War, or if you're looking for a tactical strategy game.\nIt strikes the right balance between scale and function like the men of war series and also introduces some new things.\n\nRead futher for a very long extensive review.\n\n----\n\nAs of right now, during early access, some pros over the older men of war engine the new one has.\n\nBetter Graphics\nBetter Syncing snapshots (I have not had a single desync at all)\nMore Stable engine (I have not had a single crash at all, despite being alpha build)\nLess micro, the squads are smaller, offering the same type of gameplay, but doesn't require you to flood the map with infantry.\nBetter string reference system (nice for modders)\n\nSome Cons:\nI don't like most of the map designs, this may be a personal preference, but i think the new maps have too much cover, and it looks silly that cities are flooded with single sandbags.\nI don't know what the final unit roster is, but currently it seems a bit lack luster, hopefully this will change.\n\n1. The Balance\n\nThe Balance, is pretty decent, currently favouring USA, but tanks aren't implimented so this may change or even out. I'd still say I am not a big fan of the basic model, as it is right now.\n\nYou have 2 factions GRM and USA, the GRM is nearly identical to the USA with the exception that everything they have is worse but cheaper, and they get 1 extra guy per infantry squad, though not support squads.\n\nThis is boring to me, as all it means is that as GRM you lose more guys but generally play the same just slightly less effective, so far GRM does not have a single unit that is better than the US counterpart, you just get more. And I could give a lot of examples of this, but there is no need, because this is litterally all the thought there is put into it.\n\nBear in mind, i am not saying it's unbalanced. i am just saying their balance model is boring, and not at all like in Men of War.\n\n2. Realism\n\nRight now there are many flaws in the physics and behavior of a lot of equipment, SPG-9 works like an RPG dispite being a recoiless rifle, and the speed of projectiles is dubious, I understand this isn't high on the list of things to get done. Luckily this is mostly quite easily changeable with mods, and when there is time to fix this it probably will.\n\n3. Unlock System\n\nUnlocks in mow2 were annoying, but they were kinda fast, and you could turn them off in custom games.\nIn CtA you can't turn off unlocks, they are always on.\n\nThe game punishes you for being good, since you get basically no XP for winning, but lots of xp for killing and losing units. Which means that long drawn out games that are basically a tie, will give you more XP than skillfully defeating the enemy by capturing and holding points.\n\nI really hope this will change, atleast so that unlocks are sensible, though i'd prefer them being removed though i understand some people like this sort of thing.\n\n4. New Direct Control View\n\nIs honestly not a problem, a lot of reviews seem to think it is, I am as much of a men of war veteran as the rest of them, but while i at first didn't like the system very much, i think it has a lot of potential.\n\nFirstly it looks cool, being down to earth.\nSecondly after the update to it, it is much easier to navigate with it, and i'd go as far as to say that it's more useful for urban fighting than the old direct control is, because with the new system you can actually see through allys.","August 25, 2015","true","118.0"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

And some people think GRM is underpowered. (Now apparentely they are overpowered, make up your minds).\n\nI will say this game is a lot more casual than Men of War is but I am having a lot of fun with it right now playing against the bots. Though there are only 2 factions to play as USA and GRM, there is talk of more being added in the future.\n\nThe maps are very good looking as well as the models and textures in general. I haven't played much of the singleplayer but it seems to be shaping up nicely. I always wanted a modern version of MoW and this hits the spot and it will only get better from here.\n\nThe game modes are a nice change of pace with Evacuation and King of the Hill as well as classic Domination and Last Man Standing. Hopefully there will be more game modes in the future.\n\n\nI recommend this game to any MoW players. If you're curious, buy it and see what you think.

But here is my reasoning for the the thumbs down.  (Please note this review is of the games current state right now)\n\n-  Now my biggest hate of this game comes from the amount of content in this game.  Now yes there is a editor and yes you can download maps off of steam  (Even though there isnt many).  And sure you can play multiplayer but its just not the same type of gameplay.  Now this content I am talking about is single player.  Little did I know you have to BUY the single player which is $15 dollars.  I wouldnt mind but $15 dollars for a single player campaign and a few extra goodies just isnt acceptable.  And I know its in earley access so not all the content isnt going to be in the game but no for the few missions of single player you have to BUY it.  I wouldnt mind but this game is in earley access and already there is DLC just to play a part of the game that shouldve been included with the full game in the first place.  Other than that the game is very fun and if you dont need a single player campaign and just want to 1v1 against AI or play against other people then that is fine and I recommend the game but if you are more of a single player guy than you will be disappointed.\n\n-  Note this review is of August 29 2015 and things might change.","August 29, 2015","false","3.8"," 11 of 21 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","11","21","0","2"

Perhaps won’t be a good idea to release it with this locked permanently but being forced into a certain play style does actually give one a chance to see that the game can be played and enjoyed in more way than one.\n\nLove the way the game looks and feels, love the Arabian music, and really do have much higher hopes for this game even than when I bought it. Some of the battles I had today were thrilling. I used a method of winning that I don’t think I’ve ever used in the past fighting away from his flags and mine in a far off corner where he ended up bleeding his army white trying to dislodge me in an attempt to get access to my last remaining flag. All the while I was saving for mortars and keeping what few recon men I had down. The result when these tactics work out is encirclement and happiness!\n\nIf this game was ever able to attain the success which we all know MOW has truly deserved then that would only be a great thing for us in the MOW community. Massive success will bring greater resources to the development team which would make an even better game now or in the future.\n\nWhy can’t we get behind it and wait and see and save the thumbs down reviews until after it is released?\n\nAnyone should be able to see it is early days and already is looking very promising.\n\nAnyway I’m going to give it a positive review for now to balance things out a bit, and I hope that anyone who agrees with me on this and wants this game to do well will do the same. I really hope that finally this game will end up knocking COH of its undeserved perch.\n\nIf I think the game stinks on release I will happily change this review of course and I really hope the famous crash will not be present.","August 24, 2015","true","30.8"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","7","14","0","1"

The object of the game is the same: find the enemy, fix the enemy, flank the enemy.  You essentially use your teams and the environment to gain an advantage on your adversary and destroy them before they do the same to you.  I've only played a single skirmish so far, but I had a ton of fun!  This seems to be exactly what I've been looking for in a thinking man's strategy game.

I am not going to account for new updates as I want to review the game as I played it!\nFinally, Call to Arms comes out after three years in development, what did we get as loyal Men of War fans and followers?\n\nA unfinished product that is far from completion. Let me explain...\n\n\nThe  Pros...\n\nOverall Gameplay:\nThe game is quite fun as it maintains the solid RTT elements of the World War II Men Of War games and the transition to the the Modern Era is decent. Assault rifles function properly and the micro-managing infantry combat feels like it's supposed to.\n\nMultiplayer:\nGame Modes in multiplayer are few, but fun to play against players. Small and few maps; they are well done, but are boring.\n\nThe Campaign:\nCampaign I did not touch upon; but from what I saw and talked about with other Call to Arms owners. Its decent with some vehicles being used and the overall way the missions are done are in a combination with similar style to the campaign in the first Men of War and the Skrmish mode in Men of War Assault Squad 1 and 2.\n\n\nThe Cons...\n\nThe problems that occurred (and realizations) with me while playing is this game I boiled down into three things:\n\n1. The lack of content: This game being in development for three years, I expected the game to have more Modern Vehicles, a variety of factions and amazing new features that bring this game to out-compete the original Men of War games. Well, I was wrong and the lack of content is awful. No tanks, APC's, supply vehicles,and the only ones you really get are a portable machine gun on a tripod emplacement (for both factions), a motor emplacement (again for both factions) and a humvee vehicle for the USA and a technical vehicle for the other faction. Speaking of the factions, there are only two! Again, both of the factions really only have infantry (With little variety) and only ONE vehicle! Another issue as I stated is the lack of game modes in multiplayer. Only from what I remember two-three? Assault Zones, combat and maybe one other. (Don't hold me to that on that particular complaint) Few maps make it to where multiplayer is a bore just like in Men of War Vietnam, with little to see and little to explore after playing the game two or three times.\n\n2. Three year development hell: I am glad I did not back this game, as if I were a backer, I would demand a refund. The company raising almost 100,000 euros and then it disappearing to who knows where for three whole years, then having the guts to come on Steam demanding more money for their incomplete game! Thankfully did not back this game and I am very sorry for those backers who did not really see a finished product with the amount of time they had. Point being; What the ♥♥♥♥ did you spend that money on and why is there such little content! Again, three years is PLENTY of time to make a content filled game in this genre!\n\n3. Mods and Other Games with the GEM engine are FAR superior to Call to Arms: With mods like Red Rising, (which is about to become its own game), Battle of Empires: 1914-1918 and other Men of War titles are WAY better than this game. They at least have content and were done properly from day one. They had reasonable development cycles and were finished. I have been quite happy with Men of War, Men of War Assault Squad and Men of War Assault Squad 2.  Those were well done games! (I hated Men of War: Vietnam and Men of War Condemned Heroes as they are a lot like this game when it comes to development). Also, when a mod can out-compete your new Modern day-based game, I just simply laugh!\n\n\nOther Thoughts...\n\nSome other nitpicks about the gameplay is that it's not too much different from Men Of War. Not very many new features or massive differences. Again, the Assault Rifles and other weapons are pretty decent and have a slight unique feel, but they are not this new amazing thing compared to the other Men of Wars. It honestly feels more like a "Copy and paste, then lots of retexturing" then a brand-new Modern Day RTT.\n\nOne final thing that is outside of the game is how the developers take criticism within their community. Me watching from a distance on how they dealt with fair and reasonable criticism on their steam forums and on their website is very sad as all they do is show how poor their ability is to actually address these people who again have FAIR criticism on their games. They did not say; "We will try to fix that" or "Can you elaborate more?", they just simply banned these fans. Personally, I think this can seriously hurts them in the long run if they do not have a better Public Relations team that can connect with the community better on a personal level and help solve these issues instead of create drama.\n\nConclusion...\n\nOverall, the game is FAR from completion, again, even though it's in early access, it's NOT an excuse. It's been in development for three years and had a crowdfunding campaign three years ago. Do not buy this game! You are wasting your money! Go help the Red Rising developers with their new game or go buy another GEM Engine based game! They are FAR superior products to this game.","September 20, 2015","false","1.7"," 19 of 38 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","19","38","0","0"

It is both enjoyable and greatly satisfying.\n\nPro's -\nGreat Devs - They are active in the community. They are also using advances made in this game to retroactively to update Mowas\nGreat Mods - Some mods are so good, the authors have become devs. lol\nBest RTS engine out there imho - There are not many other RTS games you can come down from an overhead view to see what going on at ground level (yes, Wargame: franchise) but then take full direct control of the units and start shooting?\nVery good looking - The models used for vehicles a sheer eye candy and the maps themselves are works of art.\nGood editor - Rubbish at it myself but made a passable map, you begin to release how well each of the ingame level are made\n\n\nCon's\nAt time of writing only 2 factions - I hope for more post release - the last game MOWAS had 5\nOccassional crashing - Game is still in development so you have to come into this with eye wide open. Previous titles suffered random crashes and this game has a number of people posting issues. For the most part, me and my freind have not had any issues. Some people still seem to suffer this more than others, regrettably this is becoming par of the course for PC gaming and even AAA's are affected, not so much the silicon lottery as software lottery.\n\n\nConclusion\nPre release I can recommend this game if you know you enjoy the deeper level RTS format and as a successor to MOWAS2. The price point for reduced "pre release" content (about £10 for delux version at time of Beta release/sale 10/2/16&31/3/16) make it well worth the investment until the final release when the price will go up. There is enough SP content with the delux edition version (SP now available to all owners of standard edition at beta) and MP content to keep you entertained until the expected release day later this year.\n\nIf you havent played MOWAS2  or are looking for a "full" game, this is probably a better starting point if you are fine with the WW2 content over modern day combat. This is on the basis that MOWAS is fully released and has a great more factions, MODs and content at this time.\n\nIf you find you like MOWAS, just be careful to make sure you dont miss out on the sale price for CTA as is likely to be a long time before the CTA is again going at this price. If both MOWAS2 and CTA are on offer I'd suggest getting both!\n\nP.S. Alot of people are negging on the multiplayer locked units, where you need to level up to unlock better tier of equipment. I really cannot see how this is an issue and it has kept me playing MOWAS2. The balance is such that if you play well 2 lots of cheaper units will take out the 1 more expensive unit.","January 19","true","69.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It kind sucks that you have to pay extra to play the single player but they said when its finished it will be available to every one. You can also play skirmish against the AI now which you can't do in Assault Squad 2 unless you got mods so thats nice but I had a great time playing the game and look forward to future content (leopard 2? germans? plzzz??)","August 26, 2015","true","7.5"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TaylorSwiftie/recommended/302670/","TaylorSwiftie","TaylorSwift","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TaylorSwiftie/","13 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI give this game a recommendation\n\nFirst, I was very skeptical of this purchase. Digitalmindsoft has been known for releasing strategy games that had no to  little changes from its predecessors. One example is MoWAS 2 which was basically a upgraded graphically version of MoWAS 1 and a few new vehicles. They could have released it as a expansion but...anyways.\n\nAfter seeing good reviews of the game and a few bad, I decided to purchase the game.\n\nAnd I really liked it.\n\nCONTENTS AND MECHANICS\nAlthough it has the same basic mechanics of every Men of War game, the game feels complete to me mechanically wise.\nAny veteran MoW player can jump right in the game and can already learn the controls without having to go over a tutorial or manual again. The controls are really responsive. One thing I did not like are damage mechanics though. Infantry and machine guns kill too fast, soldiers barely recieve 5 hits from a SA when they die.\nContent is a strong suit of this game. Each model is accurately rendered and displayed. You literally can see the grooves of the M4A1 barrel. The content is still lacking though. There are only a few weapons and vehicles both air and land as of now although that is understandable since the game is still in Early Access.\n\nSINGLEPLAYER AND MULTIPLAYER\nI can't speak for the SP right now because I don't have access to it yet as I am not a deluxe user.\nMP in this game is balanced. Basically you have two factions, one consists of highly trained soldiers(US) while the other is a terrorist group that has a few elite units but really are just people who were given a gun and sent to war without going to the firing range(GRM). The US,although has really good units, comes at an expense of costs and fewer soldiers per unit. This is compensated by their skill in medium to long range combat and has good close combat units too.\nGRM on the other hand, although their soldiers are poorly equipped, has an advantage in costs and number of men per unit. They also excel in close combat where the few US soldiers could be decimated quickly. Their advance unit also has more advanced weapons and are more versatile.\n\nGRAPHICS\nGraphics are almost the same as MoWAS2 except maybe for that gritty look. Textures are of course in high definition and very well implemented.Mortar and grenade craters look very realistic. Weapon textures are also something worth looking at. Environmental props are also improved and really provide that sense of modernity. The number of objects on screen is also much more many than previous titles.\n\nWell, that's it for my review. I'll keep it updated as the game also updates.\nEDIT:Vehicles have been released in MP\nAlthough vehicle in MP is still limited(only a few light vehicles for now), they are really a game change. They have really good anti-infrantry statistics and can actually be a replacement for a squad or two. They might seem overpowered however they have an exposed gunner so a single sniper can take out a vehicle. They also perform poorly in close range as they have little time to react and move their turrets slowly.","August 6, 2015","true","14.2"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Worth a good $10? Yes. Worth $25? Hell no.\n\nBasically a modernized version of Men of War; which I assume is a good thing since I've heard great things about MoW but haven't played any of the games. It feels a lot like basic Alpha rather than Early Access, but I'll detail that in a bit.\n\nPositives++ Sound. The audio in this game is great; the guns sound heavy and very realistic.\n+ Graphics. Game looks great if you can survive the horrid framerates.\n+ Units. The units are somewhat varied and their skill levels are easy to distinguish.\n= Vehicles. Vehicles are very detailed and have their own damage areas that have different effects on the vehicle when hit. Can't confirm that this is so much a plus for this game or just for MoW.\n\nNegatives-- Performance. Horrible framerate and response speeds. Running the game on minimum will get you around 40-55 FPS, but if you try to traverse the map too fast the game will stall and sometimes freeze.\n-- Text and UI. I hope you know exactly what each unit is, otherwise you're pretty much screwed. The descriptions of units and weapons are just the filename of what I assume will be the description's text document. Lets not forget that the game also recycles loading text from the MoW games in the loading screens.\n-- Rendering. Units will not render (become visible) unless they are pretty much in the center of your screen. You'll often see your units shooting at nothing, with only the blood textures on the ground to give any indication of what they're shooting at.\n-- Map. This is the real kicker; the zoom on this game is atrocious. You can zoom up very close to your units, or zoom out just enough to see 3/4 of a football field. Because of this horrible zoom matched with the horrible rendering, you'll be unaware of a lot of targets. The tanks and missile units will be capable of amazing range, so much so that they can shoot up to five times the range that you can zoom to. This needs to be fixed very quickly to ensure the player has more control over their armored units. NOTE: I can't confirm if this is an issue with this game or MoW.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the game is also sold in a $35 pack that increases the rate in which you unlock units. Oh yeah, did I mention you have to unlock units?\n\n\nOnly recommended to purchase at around $10.","June 4","false","16.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Still seems that troops can sometimes share these "virtual munitions". But there have been strange behavior with munition in Assault Squad games before, with troops not using their equipped munitions and shooting from some infinite source instead.\n\n- You can't do anything with troops helmet any more. It was Assault Squad trademark - helmets that could be shot off enemy head. Now they are strictly part of the unit model.\n\n- Engine still is unable to handle different munitions for the hand guns. M16 with grenade launcher can't shoot standard munitions. Just grenades.\n\n- Western weapons can not be customised. For this era game it is silly that You can't change sights, underbarrel extensions and other options.\n\n- Ability to build field fortifications seems to be gone also.\n\nDon't buy this game unless it has a decent discount.

In the past; DMS along with their respective partner(s) BestWay and former publisher 1C have consistently managed to serve-up an amazing array of endlessly playable and constantly improving military-themed RTS titles built off successive improvements to the Gem game engine. I personally consider many of their classic games to be amongst my most favorite-going way back to the initial 2004 release of Soldier's:HeroesofWWII, as their particular brand of RTS delivers the best balance of entertainment, realism, & challenge possible in a PC-based RTS game. Moreover, the MoW franchise; from which CtA is the current derivative apex, has to be the best & most smoothly blended mix of action, tactical control, and detailed sophistication that I've seen yet from this truly fun-to-play family of games. CtA is the latest and greatest DMS expansion off the MoW platform, hands-down! It is certainly no exception to this group's legacy of PC-gaming epicness and I would highly recommend it to most players out there looking for something really special in an RTS game!\n\nLike I said; CtA is a great game derived from an awesome franchise with proven potential, and it certainly has a brilliant Dev team at the helm, but finding success is gonna be an uphill battle because the franchise presents players with a double-edged sword in many ways and here's why:\n\nI think we can all agree that the mainstay of military-themed gaming tends to numerically favor the MassivelyMultiplayerOnline/FirstPersonShooter(MMO/FPS) arena; with so many more titles to choose from (such as: CallofDuty, WorldofTanks, RedOrchestra, etc...) then the less dominant RTS genre, ultimately CtA is at a disadvantage from the get go. RTS in general retains popularity somewhat on the outside-edge of the mainstream gaming world, taking that into consideration, in the past the MoWseries has appealed mostly to an even smaller, but highly dedicated, fringe community of the RTS-niche market; gamers attracted to a very specific type of 3rd-person RTS. The MoW franchise offered players something different from the average/popular/arcade feeling war-game RTS (of which similar titles would include: CompanyofHeroes, Blitzkrieg, etc); it offered truly great game immersion! CtA carries the torch, if you are willing to be patient and ride-out the steep learning curve, which unfortunately causes the MoWfranchise gaming experience to receive frequent misunderstood criticism. Although this will probably thus hurt CtA's chances in the mainstream, on the bright side, I can confidently say CalltoArms solves a lot of the previous MoWseries problems. Many of the glitches, weaknesses in playability, and areas in which the game generally needed tweaks are improving with each new developer's update released to CtA's early-access supporters (I personally went with the more content-rich 'Deluxe' edition for $30bucks American).\n\nSince CtA is currently in Pre-Release Alpha, it's is bound to be a bit rough around the edges; but the issues are steadily being addressed and refined almost weekly. Additionally, it's true that some general MoWseries drawbacks carry into CtA; a big one being that novice RTS gamers find it far too overly complicated, but for the most part, RTS is supposed to be more complex than say any FPS'er, and the MoW/CtA franchise is probably even harder to learn than your average RTS because the tactical breadth of options and wide scope of possible customizations results in near limitless options (which is supposed to at least partially mirror it's real world counterpart forces). Tactics is all about options! A lot like the game of chess, thus the expectation of 'user-friendly' andor "ease of use" are unfair criticisms IMO. Additionally, some seasoned RTS gamers (who can get past the more complex playability) think the franchise lacks/has always lacked a more finely-polished surface-level "sex appeal," like that of its closest competitors, but I can assure you CtA looks great and is competitive with the most current game title's technology. CtA is definitely the sexiest looking, smoothest running, and most highly visually detailed MoW incarnation to date.\n\nI really do believe the mainstay of CtA’s detractors criticisms reflect the "double-edged sword" of RTSgaming; there is always gonna be a fine line between success and failure with these games when it comes down to how good an RTS game looks and how well it plays, CalltoArms excelles at both if your expectations are reasonable. Furthermore, it's relevant and necessary when considering CtA to also look back at it's predecessors for evidence of growth, and IMHO, the evidence of improvement in CtA is clear, and hopefully this will allow for greater mass-appeal. CtA is a very contemporary game, the atmosphere is relevant, the tech is modern, it’s faster paced than its ancestor games, it plays well, it is still loaded with options but not overwhelmingly so, it retains a modified version of the ‘direct-control’ feature so beloved of the MoWfranchise, and it is a very smooth looking game all around; so it’ll satisfy the small minority of hardcore MOW/RTS fans, as well as attract a wider fanbase who can adapt to it and appreciate its brilliant nuances.","September 8, 2015","true","903.0"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","44","4","9","2","0"

So far this is proving an exception.\n\nA big factor for me is the ability to include AI players in multiplayer games, essentially giving me the singleplayer skirmish mode I so longed for in the other Men of War type games. The sounds and graphics are way more polished than what I had seen from the other titles but in some ways this only draws more attention to the clunky old animations left over from the older games.\n\nI absolutely love this game's take on the Men of War direct control system. The version in this game is much more intuitive and immersive, though it only affects vehicles right now. It is to be hoped that these changes make their way to the control of infantry as well.\n\nAs someone who hates playing things online, I profoundly resent the levelling system which does not allow you to use more advanced units until you've reached a certain level that, as I understand it, requires ranked online play. It should be possible to use all units if you're not playing online.","March 30","true","2.5"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FALprofessional/recommended/302670/","FALprofessional","FALprofessional","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FALprofessional/","41 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nOver the past fews months this has been in early access, some have critized this game as being essentially "Men of War: Assault Squad: Modern Assault Mod: The Game." I can see where that comes from, but I don't see it being the case. I just feel I should lend some thoughts on the game so far.\n\nThe Mod\nYes, it certainly does look like the Modern Assault mod for Assault Squad 2. However, it is simply not a mod. Go here if you want to see it for yourself: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=411118383\n\nThere are plenty of vehicle, weapon, and soldier assets made for the mod, but they are just not the quality you will get out of a dedicated studio. The maps and some assets are repurposed, so eastern and western European structures appear in a modern setting more often than not. Not to say that architure doesn't exist in present day. You could say that is just the theater of war for a specific battle, but a mix of original and recycled models, assets, and such can you only get you so far. Digitalmindsoft takes the great concept and presents it in full force. The mod's development is also frozen, so don't expect more content and improvements out of it any time soon.\n\nThe Game\nThis is a game, therefore it includes things you would expect of a game. All of the assets are professionally modelled, recorded, and maintained. A full-fledged modern campaign is in the works. It has dedicated servers, courtesy of SteamWorks. It will be featuring a secret-services themed DLC, which will be available to those who purchase the game in its early-access state, free of charge. That, on top of game engine, interface, and mechanics improvements. So on and so forth. In terms of unit count, you can expect that of Men of War games: plenty of diverse units, weapons, vehicles, equipment, and, in this case, weapon accessories. So, flashlights, lasers, silencers, and the like. You also make use of a nightvision view for when the map cycles to night. You can also host local games against AI, which was sorely lacking in previous games. That is a plus from me.\n\nSummary\nDigitalmindsoft is going out on a little limb here in publishing this game themselves, but I think they have faired well so far. They have been consistent, responsive, and rather frequent with their Dev Updates. Their 14th Dev Update was March 11th, and they have made great strides in asking the community what we want next (what vehicles, modes, etc.), implementing new graphic technologies, improving multiplayer competitivness (in terms of gamemodes, I don't care for the leveling system), releasing the missions of the campaign for testing for those who purchased the Deluxe Edition, and all around keeping us informed as to where our money is going in this critical time for the game. There has been controversy over things like the 3rd person control mode, bullet damage models, and the like, but it all seems to be leading to the betterment of the game.\n\nTruely, with games these days often having a retail cost of $60 (RTS, FPS, etc), its, previously $20 price, now $25 price is still rather generous, if I do say so myself. And, I don't know about you, but I have always wanted a modern version of Men of War, and it grants that wish pretty well. Last time I checked (5 months ago), there wasn't a very high multiplayer population, but maybe that is because it is still in early access. That is not too detrimental for me, because you can now host local lobbies with AI, which is a good time, and I primarily play these games for the campaign. Still, some may not take very kindly to this. Nonetheless, It still maintains that unique Men of War RTS DNA, and I just think this game deserves a bit more love from the community.","March 14","true","11.0"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Under 7$ for one of the best rts games I have ever played, admittedly it is missing some polish, and could use other factions/more units. Even that said, I would have paid full price if I heard of it sooner.\n\nTactically very sound and graphically very pretty(Though has some stutter issues). This game is a micro managers wet dream. The ai in this game is a real challenge as well. Playing the Co-Op gamemode evacuation can come down to just a few soldiers, causing you to micro manage your medics and have your riflemen improvise and pick up other units weapons to use against them.\n\nThats right, in this game every soldier has an inventory, not every UNIT, but every individual soldier. This allows you to go as far as to pick up spare rounds, bandages and grenades, you can also manage the inventory of vehicles. You can split these units up how you see fit, garrisoning them in seperate buildings to create firing arc's etc.\n\nControlling units individually is also a thing, simply hold control and you are in for some serious gameplay. Use every truck, tank, and individual to the fullest by firing manually on targets, this allows precise firing on various buildings etc. Not to mention it is a huge breath of fresh air to see a unique feature like this added to rts games. A bit of action combat essentially adds another layer to the game, especially in multiplayer when some guy is precision sniping your vital mg's and medics.\n\nAll in all the game is worth full price, and most I have run into from the steam sale would agree. Played for many hours yesterday and I am about to boot this up again! Defnitely worth a buy if you are a fan of tactical rts and teamwork.","March 31","true","36.1"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

So having sunk a ton of hours into the multiplayer of call to arms and being a huge fan of the men of war series in general I will try to explain my experience. While the game is clearly not done as most of unit discriptions still say squad1,squad2 ect. the game is a little confusing as you are really unaware of what units are good , and what they do exactly. the game balance needs some work and arguebly the GRM are the best faction. Having better units means nothing to experienced players when overwelming firepower is the asnswer to almost all your porrblems. The pricing is my main arrguement it just costs too much for the usa to really compete and countless times I have swarmed or been swarmed by sheer numbers. The counter is play really good, better then your opponent. which isn't really fun. One mistake can find you behind on the buys and next thing you know vehicles are in play and you don't have any AT. but this goes for both factions. Veterans of men of war will find it's basicly the same old game. However those players ususally suck, and wont take the time to see the differrences in tactics and gameplay.\n\nWar has changed, the importance of position is everything and finding the perfect flanking cover is the key to not watching your men get gunned down immediately. It's like all the inf have mg 42s and moving around is easier said then done. The new direct control feature is flipping terrible, and ai pathing really needs work. but these things are being slowly addressed and fixed. I recommend this game, if only to kill you one time in multiplayer because the community is split between god like players and the worst players on earth. This game is something different it's not men of war with new skins, its men of war with a modern theme. People give them ♥♥♥♥ for using the same game engine as mowas2 but at least it's not the same maps same units, it's unique and fun in it's own right.\n\nSo buy this game, maybe not now but in the future, when it's more complete. You might hate it but jsut remember you suck and getting better takes time. See you on the battlefield ♥♥♥♥♥es.","September 2, 2015","true","116.1"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

If you like Men of War then you certainly will like Call to Arms! Of course it's no finnished experience yet but already so much fun to play! It's in alpha, you know. There is a limited number of players in MP so far. But that will change after it's release. But I have to say it's kind of tough to play. I have the impression that the difficulty level got raised a notch. But it's really rewarding if you succeed because you move tactically and position your soldiers carefully.\nThe graphics are really nice, too! I love the detail and overall look of the vehicles. And even the infantry looks cool.

Graphically it is about as good as any other modern RTS on the market, that said, it runs very smoothly with only a few hiccups during MP (could be the host issues though). The MP is very fun although I am not very good at it. I am looking forward to the addition of vehicles and whatnot, but I  would like to know if there are plans to release other factions?

As for server population, it is usually quite low. There are always less than 300 people in game when I am on and sometimes it can take a while to find a game room to fill up.\n\nThe game is decently optimized (though the graphics aren't super beautiful) and I'm able to run it at high/ultra settings with AA off at 1440p with an r7 360 at 40+ fps. The gameplay that i've been able to play has been fun and AI isn't horridly stupid so that's good (though sometimes they take the path right into the line of fire when there is another way behind cover).\n\nFor a game in early access it has a decent amount of content and there are plenty of mods out there to make it more exciting such as more maps, "tactical" mode to make it a bit more challenging, etc. I'm excited to see what comes and I hope more people will play so servers are more populated!

MoW AS 2 was best I have foud in long long time!\n\nNow about Call to arms, I understand that there is some bad reviews about this, but this is only because people doesn't realize that this is early access, not full version of game and that's why it lacks features, content and is bit buggy at the moment, but as you realize this fact, and you are familiar with earlier games this grew has done, there is no doubt that this is going to be awesome... I just played my first internet game and even with the bugs and lack of content etc etc, I got the feeling that this is going to be as rock solid kick ♥♥♥ war game as MoW AS 2, AS IT WILL BE READY!  So, if you don't understand what early access means, don't buy this yet, if you are new to this game and game series but you like realtime strategy, start with Men of War series first and experience this great game series and buy this when it is ready and finalized!\n\nI can't wait till this is ready!","August 5, 2015","true","4.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

As for server population, it is usually quite low. There are always less than 300 people in game when I am on and sometimes it can take a while to find a game room to fill up.\n\nThe game is decently optimized (though the graphics aren't super beautiful) and I'm able to run it at high/ultra settings with AA off at 1440p with an r7 360 at 40+ fps. The gameplay that i've been able to play has been fun and AI isn't horridly stupid so that's good (though sometimes they take the path right into the line of fire when there is another way behind cover).\n\nFor a game in early access it has a decent amount of content and there are plenty of mods out there to make it more exciting such as more maps, "tactical" mode to make it a bit more challenging, etc. I'm excited to see what comes and I hope more people will play so servers are more populated!

Direct control was also improved for that - now you can control your vehicle almost through first person perspective, arcade-style, which is pretty fun.\n\nThe one major downside is still there however - you need to grind levels to unlock the better stuff. And even then the way the game is currently balanced in usual game modes it's nearly impossible to see a tank, unless you actively idle for reinforcement points. But where's the fun in that?\n\nOverall however the progress devs have made with this game is quite promising.","January 18","true","35.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

But so far this feels like a reskin through and through. There is much improvment over the Assault squad games, but it feels almost Identicle to AS2. And, Just like AS2, I am unable to reliably play the game. Both Call to arms and AS2 both crash randomly, lag out randomly, and outright freeze all the time. I get a billion notices that "video quality has been reduced to improve performance" while I play, if I even get through a game.  Crank it to Minimum...just as laggy, just as freezy, and have to close it out.\n\nHowever, I do see enough change in direction with the game mechanics to justify a new game.

But dont worry, when one Mlaw hits the frount of your T-80 and instantily explodes you'll feel really good.

Here's why.\n\nFirst of all, there're only multi-player with some infantry and 2 type of light vehicle are available in the current version which makes the game extremely featureless. I know it's still under early access title, but game with this limited feature? I only consider it as alpha access because there's nothing I can test with it.\n\nEven I look up to the vehicle list via map editor, vehicle is still not enough in my perspective. There're only single type of tank, two types of APC in the USA faction. This is totally unacceptable compare to it predecessor "Men of War", with thousand varies type of tank.\n\nSecondly, about the gameplay. The developers added a chase camera when players try to directly control a vehicle which is something I hate about it. Although some may say it makes Call to Arms more realistic, still I don't think that is what "Men of war series" need. What I mean is chase camera took out some of my enjoyment exist since MOW and now they're all gone.\n\nThat's all for now, I will update my review once I notice improvement.","August 10, 2015","false","18.0"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

I recommend the game to people that like tactical infantry combat with a lot of possibilities for micromanagement of units. It's about intense encounters, dynamic gameplay with shifting fronts, flanking and outsmarting your opponents. If you know the men of war series you know what basic mechanics to expect, but you need to realize that in this game you will have a lot less tanks in standard multiplayer games. It's about making every soldier count and not about the large scale battles where you just throw squads against the frontline. You can have different settings in custom games or with mods though.\nYou need to be aware the game has a unit unlocking system for standard multiplayer games that is based on XP. I'm not a big fan of that, but I understand why it is there. Rest assured no important unit is locked even at level 1. The later unlocks are mainly more risky purchases that could cause an inexperienced player to lose a game too quickly if he makes a dumb mistake. You level up rather quickly though and you can grind out XP in bot matches if you want. So no reason to throw a fit about the whole thing. There is also a mod to disable unit locking entirely.","August 2, 2015","true","66.6"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","40","4","10","2","0"

When I was uploading to my youtube channel whilst playing this my entire lobby suffered lag that would cause the game to stop momentarily, quite often, when my ping surpassed 350ms. When not uploading and having enough free bandwidth to keep my ping below 80ms there were no issues. I havent tested any further ranges of ping between.\n\nMy biggest pro woul dbe that to play this with your friends is one of the most interesting and engaging games to participate in as a team. Roles can be given or you can just play it your own way. Theres are so many playstyle possibilites for this. You can choose to just control a small group of specialists and leave the rest of the companies within your force to be managed by your team mates or you can choose to have a little bit of everything. Do you prefer to play the sniper elite or the vehicle company or do you want to play them all?\n\nI reccommend this game, for its target audience; which would be people who want a milisim / rts  or as close as they can get to it.","November 1, 2015","true","36.4"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FuckwitSupreme/recommended/302670/","FuckwitSupreme","Lich","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FuckwitSupreme/","64 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nCall to Arms is a difficult game to give my thumbs-up to, yet I do so notwithstanding several rather strange development decisions. It largely sets out what it intended to do - recreate the Men of War experience in a present-day scenario - and does so in a manner that is simple and fun. It's actually rather easy to hop right into the game and control your units, but as with every strategy game the challenge lies in mastering those units - and the fun lies in surmounting that challenge and beating The Other Guy into submission.\n\nThat said, CtA has flaws, some rather glaring ones in fact. The first and perhaps most obvious of these that a player will encounter is the much-maligned level lock. For some reason best known to themselves, Digital Mindsoft have actually made it so that units are completely locked out to players who have not ground their way to a certain level - in sharp contrast to the MoW games, where all units are unlocked for usage right from the get-go. The least they could have done is made the lock optional, again like the MoW games. In spite of that, this is a problem that can be surmounted rather easily: there are at least two mods that allow players to beat the level lock and get all of the units without worrying about grinding.\n\nThe second flaw, again pertaining to units and factions, is that they are rather lacking, but as with the above I will be lenient with this flaw, simply because it's in Early Access and it only recently got out of alpha. In addition, this error can be resolved with mods and will most likely be resolved by the devs themselves once the game leaves Early Access.\n\nPrecisely because it's in Early Access, I'm much more willing to give CtA the benefit of the doubt for problems that I would not nearly be so forgiving for should this wind up released in a similar state it's in now.","April 23","true","6.3"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

The previous bugs of vehicle combat, not being able to look up when in direct control of a vehicle, and various other issues have been resolved. So far there is a full roster of infantry units with multiple light vehicles and two medium vehicles, an IFV and a "medium tank" per faction. Even though the selection is small, as is to be expected, everything is well balanced. So far i havent found a glitch, big or small. Cover works well. AI seems greatly improved over MOWAS, never played AS2. Instead of having to rearm each unit with specific ammo types, units near ammo crates automatically refill their small arms ammo. I do not think that grenades refill, but im pretty sure that RPG and other forms of AT rounds do. Will test this theory. Also most AFV's have the ability to resupply infantry ammo and most come with three AT rockets which is nice. There are a couple really good player created missions, namely SirHinkels. His missions were very well polished, challenging but balanced, and exceptionally fun to play. All in all, I'd say that this game is definitely worth getting, and should be on everyones radar.","October 21, 2015","true","43.8"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

However, I have only ran into 1 so far: an invincible enemy soldier.\n\nPros\n- Is probably one of the few if not the only modern strategy game where the only strategy isn't to make fourty of every unit and just throw it all at the enemy's base. You must use caution and use your units wisely.\n- Kind of goes with the above statement. Armored units are not abundant, you cannot throw armor at the enemy like in "World in Conflict" and hope you win. With that being said, World in Conflict is still a very good game.\n- Ammo: In the original Men of War and Assault Squad 1, you had to drag ammo to each individual soldier, this gets tiresome when you have an entire army to re-arm. In Call to Arms, soldiers are automatically rearmed when close to an ammo box, no more pointless dragging.\n- Realistic units and weapons: Has many up to date firearms and vehicles. Should please gun nuts and vehicle gurus alike.\n\nCons\n- Currently limited in terms of actual gameplay, only 4 SP missions currently, and a few more MP maps. but it is still in alpha so it's not that big of deal.\n- Audio: Currently uses Men of War's voices and weapon audio (cant say for all weapons). Again, hopefully this will be changed in the beta or final release.\n- Bugs: have only ran into 1 bug (invincible enemy) not that big of deal but I did have to restart the map.\n- Workshop- currently a lot of the workshop content is unusable as they need to be updated, but that can change at any moment.\n\n\nTo finish, it is a great game for a person wanting a modern strategy game that doesn't involve spamming 30,000 tanks and attacking the enemy. You will need to strategize. Also, GET THE DELUXE VERSION, save yourself $5.00 and just get the deluxe to begin with.

While that may sound cool, you can already do this... with mods.. that don't cost $20. (Remeber when Steam tried to charge for Workshop items?)\n\nIt's also in extreme early access, so all you can do is play small infantry battles with crappy AI, or try your luck at matchmaking (which crashes the game half the time).

With Workshop,people prepare for more factions soon. The amount of editing the creators have done in order to create this is impressive,with new AI,animations,vehicles,and more. Also,I have begun using helicopters. Those REALLY Need work however. Both factions have had alot of work for texturizing and making it feel modern instead of a ww2 reskin. I have not experienced any crashes in game.\nCons:\nOnly one con,which is really picky-ish.

I have seen it develop from a fairly bare bones game to a much more varied RTS. This is still early access so features are yet to be added. Despite this however, there is a lot that the game already offers. As of now there is a small US campaign available from the latest update which is very fun to play through. Much like MOWAS there is an active modding community bringing more challening missions and maps to the game, furthering the game's replayability (even a word?)\n\nSpeaking as an avid MOWAS player I can tell a lot has been done to optimise the game engine. Everything feels smoother, the explosions no longer tank the framerate and the units path better aroud objects. Since they added armoured vehicles like the M2 Bradley and M1 Abrams the game suddenly became much more satisfying. When controlling these vehicles  you now get gunsights, a key feature missing from previous games. Furthermore the vehicles seem to take different amounts of damage depending upon which weapon/vehicle you use. For example, the GRM BTR is weaker than the comparable Stryker which does make a lot of sense as they are old machines. This isn't a point to take as negative however, as the GRM infantry are very capable of knocking out a tank very quickly so the infantry balance the superior US armour out.\n\nI really enjoy this game and have confidence that Digitalmindsoft will deliver a really exquisite modern RTS :)\n\n9/10","March 5","true","21.3"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

I watched many youtube videos of the gameplay and really thought I would like it. I tried to like it, looking past the cons I really wanted to like it. Its almost a solid RTS.\n\nPros:\nGraphics were good to me, not cartoony like most RTS's\nChallenging game play (During a skirmish things could change in an instant based on cover)\nVariety of units that seemed to be better or worse at certian things\n\nCons: (where to begin)\n*Paid and Downloaded only to find the single player non-existant. Attempted to verify download and still nothing. (Be nice if the description said something other than Multiplayer BS with special gift for the deluxe version)\n*Skirmish options basically limit what YOU can build. Numerous times I changed to only infantry (learning the basics due to no single player) and guess what? I can only make infantry but little do I realize I have about 5 humvees and 3 tanks attack my position.....maybe I forgot to make sure to unclick that option? Nope only infantry units SHOULD be available.\n*0 tutorial on how to do anything in the game, I learned more from the youtube videos prior to purchase than the game ever showed me\n*Difficulty settings mean apparently nothing in this game. Set on Easy (again learning how to play because no single player or tutorial) got crushed. Ok lets level the playing field with AI allies to help on same setting as opponet, got crushed again.  Lets see how Heroic Allies does against the 1 easy opponet, Yup Crushed Again. Turned the opponet to Heroic and got the exact same gameplay level as on easy.\n*Creating a map is great , but why is it so ♥♥♥♥ing hard to upload it and play it?\n\nLiterally the first game I've paid for on steam and this is the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t I get. Not sure how/where all the Youtube videos came from but it is definately not this build of the alpha.\n\n\nOverall listen to the negative reviews about this alpha and wait for it to atleast turn into beta (Although that doesn't seem to happen anymore on steam) Likely the first and last time I pay for an alpha version","December 6, 2015","false","32.2"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","1"

Wont help and wont let u into "they're"game\nfurther more u cannot play singleplayer in the traditional sense unless u buy the "deluxe" edition witch is the same as the regular but unlocked.\nThis really limits you're gameplay to custom maps filled with bots witch can be fun but tedious upping skill lvl of\nthese AI makes it challenging, but that's about it.\n\nLast thing get you're refund in quick before you're checked it out more then 2 hours  (which is next to nothing)\nor haven't given up on it just yet giving it might come in 2 weeks. <- it over in a wink then u lost you're money.\nso in all save it for a more deserving game.","September 29, 2015","false","4.0"," 4 of 14 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","4","14","0","0"

Haven't experienced any performance issues but I'm only an hour in and don't care about the multiplayer, so take that with a grain of salt.\n\nIf I were going to complain about something, though, it'd be the sound effects. Never have assault rifles, heavy machine guns and exploding vehicles sounded so flat and nonthreatening and the soldier's voices are identical to the Men of War voices.\n\nGreat game, though. If you can pick it up on sale for $8.74, like I did, you're getting a hell of a deal! At full price? Well it is basically a Men of War game set in the modern era and I imagine that's going to be the case even at full release. I guess it depends on how impatient you are to play it and whether or not you already have Men of War: Assault Squad 2, which is complete, extremely good, basically the same game but set in WW2, and can be had for the same price as Call to Arms.  It also dips as low as $8 on sale.\n\nBottom line: The game is very good, so far, and absolutely worth it on sale. Value at full price will vary from person to person.","June 6","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
