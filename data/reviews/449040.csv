"http://steamcommunity.com/id/badhairqueen/recommended/449040/","badhairqueen","badhairqueen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/badhairqueen/","55 products in account","OverviewThis is a fully functioning RPG with 3 games: you can play as Baby Jesus, Adult Jesus, or Jesus after the rising. I've only tried playing as Baby Jesus so far and have found the experience surprisingly fun - way more than I expected it to be! The game is very easy to understand and grasp - you'll get the hang of how things work after some trial and error, even if RPGs aren't your thing.\n\nPlaying the Baby Jesus game    You get to control Mary and Joseph first, and lead them through to the birth of Christ. After Jesus is born, the game then switches you over to the 3 wise men, which you control. You must lead them from their kingdom through the desert and other locations until you reach Christ in Bethlehem. After visiting Christ and giving him their gifts, you then switch back to playing Mary, Joseph and now Baby Jesus as well.\n\nAs the 3 wise men, en route to visiting Baby Jesus, you will fight random enemies - both human and non-human - and get to visit nomad camps where you can recharge ("miracle pools" restore all HP and other aspects), as well as historical locations mentioned in the bible: e.g. Tower of Babel, the ruins of Babylon, etc. Talking to random characters yields tips and secrets (e.g. how to fight certain spirits, which characters can use magic, etc), and fighting enemies like desert bandits and ghosts gives you greater experience and allows you to level up pretty fast.\n\nPlaying as the 3 wise men is seriously fun, because they can use magic, and a lot of fun weapons. Not all magic works on all enemies; you have to figure out what works on whom! Playing as Mary, Joseph and Baby Jesus is a lot more challenging, since Baby Jesus can do almost nothing, and Mary's attacks are generally poor - her main line of defence is using angels, which requires lots of AP (Angel Points).\n\nNo matter whom you play as, all characters will encounter "boss enemies" at some point or other. As the 3 wise men, one of their boss enemies was the spirit of a prophet from a different religion! (No, not Muhammad, but some other Persian-sounding guy.) And as Mary, Joseph & Baby Jesus, you get to fight King Herod, who's bent on killing all male infants, just as in the bible.\nWhat I really liked    True to the bible - The story stays pretty true to what's mentioned in the bible. Maybe dates and such might not line up perfectly, but you do get the same characters (e.g. Nimrod - the founder of Babylon, King Herod, etc), the same locations (e.g. Nazareth, Judea, Babylon, etc) and the same stories (e.g. why the Tower of Babel was never completed - and by the way you get to visit it!).\nReally interesting - If you think about it, the events depicted in the bible make for a great RPG! Wise men have to travel to visit Christ, Mary & Joseph must journey to Egypt and protect Baby Jesus along the way, etc etc. There's potential for a great adventure here, and this game fully realises and makes use of this. One of the things I liked in particular was how: as the 3 wise men, when you reach the top of the Tower of Babel (after defeating various enemies, including the ghost of Nimrod himself), you find a dictionary that will allow you understand Hebrew so you can enter Judea!\nFully functional - I thought this was a gag game at first, and that it would just be a bare bones kind of RPG. But no. There are tons of items, from food to weapons to armour, that you can buy and sell whenever you meet certain characters in the game. Your characters must learn to use the skills they have (e.g. Mary can call angels, the 3 wise men can use magic, etc), and you must strategise in order to defeat enemies in the best way possible.\nDoesn't involve spending "real" money - You don't have to spend a real-world cent. Gold can be obtained by defeating enemies or selling items.\nGreat story - It really feels as though you are living through actual events depicted in the bible. There's drama, excitement, etc! And small "side stories" (like the Tower of Babel for instance).\nExcellent dialogue - Even random characters you meet say interesting stuff. Some offer tips, while others say witty lines. And they don't all say the same thing! They're not all "canned responses" like you get in some other games!\nAmusing enemies - In addition to the common desert bandit/robber/thief, you also encounter ghosts of prophets, dead kings, etc, who can be quite challenging, or require the use of specific methods in order to be defeated. What's not to like?!\nDecent graphics - The part where you walk about is ok - buildings are well-drawn, down to details like ivy climbing up walls, cracks in buildings, etc. Enemies or other characters close-up (e.g. in battle) are nothing to look at, but they still work for me.\nFun, light-hearted humour - So far from what I've played and encountered, I didn't come across anything that was disrespectful to the bible or Christianity. Most dialogue was well-written and witty, without ever being insulting.\nWhat I didn't like    The music - It sounds like what my 286 used to produce back in the '80s. Ouch. I know the developer was aiming for something "retro" that fit with the 8-bit-looking graphics, but this was just no. It's annoying. And painful.\nSummaryThis has been even more fun and entertaining than most of the paid RPGs I've tried in my life, and given me far more gameplay hours than a lot of games I paid for. The only thing I didn't like was the music, which hopefully, the developer can change quite easily? I would pay for this game in a heartbeat!!!\n\nTips to developerChange the music, and this game would be perfect! The writing and story are gold! Please make another similar game to this, also perhaps based on historical texts, writings, etc. I would gladly pay to play!\n\nHELP!!!At the point of time I'm writing this review, I'm stuck at King Herod (playing as Mary + Joseph + Baby Jesus). If anyone knows how to beat him (no game guides are up yet) please let me know!\n\nDisclaimer                I am an atheist and reviewing this game from an atheist's perspective. However I read the bible extensively - from start to end - when I was younger (out of curiosity) so am familiar with most of the main biblical characters and tales.","March 28","true","14.0"," 87 of 98 people (89%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","89","87","98","10","15"

Yes, it plays with religion a lot in order to have any sense of a story, but that doesn't make the game bad. Speaking as a Pagan, I could put my religious views aside and just enjoy the random insanity this game has to offer. If you like old-school RPGs, a witty bit of historical and word-play humor, and don't take this game so seriously, then you'll enjoy it. Also, before anyone declares this game to be an insult to Christianity, need I remind you that there was an NES game where you controlled a camel that carried Mary and Joseph through the arctic while you spat seeds at soldiers, so get over yourselves and have some fun.","April 7","true","2.5"," 55 of 68 people (81%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","81","55","68","22","1"

The story and design are as simplistic as was Christ's manger.\n\nLet's begin with the design.\nThe pictures all appear handcrafted as you can see in the previews. It rubbed me in a South Park-ish kind of way which gave me a few reservations because of the liberty South Park takes at ridicule. I kept an open mind because Christ Jesus had one of the greatest senses of humor... it says so in the bible!\nCombat is unbalanced. While it was pretty funny to have sent over 320 pixelated enemies to He ll, it was way too easy to beat them and then level up. Enemies are so easy and so I was baffled when I accidentally tumbled apon a boss "Mazda" and could do nothing. In fact, this made the game very stale, game play-wise.\n\nFinally let us review the Story.\nAt one time in history this story was told by the finest artists of Florence, Italy and funded by the great wealth of the Medici family. For such a great story it probably deserves the finest artists in the gaming industry, the smartest coders, the most intrepid lead designers and enough funding that would rival the bankroll of Bethseda Softworks, Eidos, or any other successful game company.\nBut same as in the story, God didn't bring a King into the world to be born on a lavish throne. He chose a simple manger with hay. He chose a bunch of dirty fishermen to build a Church for him. And in the case of this game's story, he chose a very very medocre game designer to tell the greatest story ever told! It was very sweet, it warmed my heart to Christianity all over again and I even said a prayer for the designer. For that reason I recommend the game.\n\nOh and did you notice the game was free?","March 19","true","7.3"," 24 of 33 people (73%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","73","24","33","11","0"

Earthbound is all I can think about while I play this game. Regardless, Jesus Christ RPG Trilogy is a set of 3 role playing games based around the life of Jesus of Nazareth. As a Christian I find this game very interesting, light hearted, and even with it's some-what ridiculous jokes and modern references, not at all offensive.\n\nThe JC games have a well implemented "turned based" combat system, meaning you and your allies attack, then your enemy and their allies attack. The visuals aren't mind-blowing, but this isn't a problem as the game is designed to imitate a 90's RPG game, once again similar to Earthbound.\n\nThis game is very fun, cute, corny and very humorous, I do enjoy playing JC RPG Trilogy very much, and I do intend to play this game a lot more.\n\nPlease play this game. It's free-to-play, it's very decent in scope and aspiration, that deserves some love. Surely the fact we have another kid-friendly game on Steam is something also worth praise.","March 28","true","5.3"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","72","13","18","3","0"

The music does get alittle better later on but it's just a few tracks in the 3 RPGs put together. There is no option in the game to turn down the music or sound effects not even a mute within the game.\n\nThe animation is crudly simplistic, not like a retro looking game (UNDERTALE example), but more like the animator did not have the time or skill to make it better since it looks like a childs parody on a sitcom of the artstyle of (South Park).\nIt is easy to see who Jesus is. The others are mostly too blad to be able to seperate from each other. In the cut-like-sceens you can see the difference between Judas, Jesus and Mary. The 3 wise kings are all small 1st graders view of how a wizard looks. They do not have facial feathers just the hair, black skin and different colors on the clothings. All their countrymen/subjects have the same layout just with all green clothing.\nMost of the NPCs are just copy pasted on their apperence, there are afew kinda funny NPCs in hell. The Apostles of Jesus look mostly the same appart from the 3 you get in the party. You need to cure people of illnesses, and some of them needs the word of Jesus to deside something.\nEnemys have mostly just a few bodys to share. There are blue robbers with black robes, demons in suits and sunglasses in different colors, the demon's skins not the suits their black. Floating crystal like heads with eyes and a mouth, the boss Ahura Mazda has this skin first but a slight color change is the thing that differs this God's apperence from the random enemys that come after him. Tammuz is looking like this too. Do not fight him he is a sponge with ok dmg that will take a long time to kill and he does not give as much exp or cash as the other enemys. A king you meet in the wise king's quest becomes a random encounter in the 3rd one. Soldiers, Demons and Turists will have their body on the map like (Pokemon Trainers) but short sighted so that you can fight them or not. There is also a Belzebub demon fly skin with 2 minions that has just a different color then the boss. Only a few of the bosses are worth nothing cause they have their own skins that are no reused. Satan, Pandemonium and a few others are on this list.\n\nThe Combat is just like in (Final Fantasy 1). Turnbased where you need to use your entire teams abilitys and then they will all do their thing. You can not see your party in other ways then a hp bar, menu, but not the body of them only the enemys in a bland background. The attack effects are almost not even there and really bland. You have 5 different meters in the Combat that you can use. HP, MP, MP, AP and TP. Health Points: no need to explain what this is. Miracle Points: The same as mana but it only works with Jesus's miracle moves, later some others in your party will get miracle skills to. Magic Points: Only the 3 wise kings can use magic and you get magic buy taking on magical weapons. Angel Points: Virgin Mary is the only one that can use this, you summon angels that can do 1 thing each, just like a skill, Talent Points: Some humans can use this, it is just like magic but it replaces the (Angel Point bar) in later parts of the trilogy. You have consumables like Fish, Water, Bread and so on. They can restore your point bars, read to check what they do but they do not give the % or number of how much they do. The EGG is the same as a (Final Fantasy - Phoenix Down). Most have 2 weapon slots. Jesus will never learn to hold a weapon or attack. It isen't more then 10 levels and they will make you overpowered each level since you get like 100 or more hp from just going to level 2. In Rise of Jesus the cap level is more then 10. There are some healing springs in the world but no other ways in the start to survive then using consumables. Refrain is nothing more then a Defend move,\n\nThe Story follows (The new Testament), atleast the most famous parts with alot of fantasy in there. Mech, tower of Bable and other things like this.\n\nIn no way is this a good game, but if you wanna test this out for yourself then do it. It is free after all. Good Luck and Have fun :)","March 21","false","5.4"," 25 of 49 people (51%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","51","25","49","2","2"

The game design and gameplay are phenomenal, really capturing the atmosphere of the setting as well as being very intuitive(the idea of having miracles as skills is really unique). The animations are smooth and truely outstanding, and the 3D modelling was a pleasant surpise that just added that extra zest to the game. Overall, with a combination of amazing atmosphere, holy story to base off of, splendid visuals, and ambient yet powerful music, the Jesus Christ Trilogy is an amazing set of games that is truly a gem in the rough.","April 8","true","0.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

The first enemy I faced, Beelzebub, couldn't be defeated. Also, it's not like I was under level, it's impossible to fight any enemies before beelzebub, because you don't get any attacks until you trigger the event that forces you to fight beelzebub. Obviously the game is either broken or I'm just doing something wrong, but even if I use the healing items from the beginning of the game, it does nothing to help.

Angel with an horribly modeled face comes, and makes mary get pregnant in 1 single frame. Then Joseph is INVITED to a census in bethleem, but, if he does not assist, he'll be killed wih everyone along his family. Because he'll be concidered a tax avoider with an offshore account in the Cayman islands.\n\nAlso, the governor of Syria is a massive stalker.\n\nSo you go to bethleem, fight guys who would kill a PREGNANT lady for a room.\nThen you meet the 3 elve- I mean, 3 kings, and then I died.\n\nGG","April 23","false","1.2"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

I have never played a game with so much depth before. I mean, As a Railist, thi game made me convert to evangical christianity. I now speak in tongues (Hebrew) and have the Lord enter my body on a dailly basis. I used to be believe we came from tadpoles, but now I believe we came from an rpg, the Jesus Christ rpg.\n\nHowever, this game did have it's faults. One being the inaccuracies, for example how when Jesus started his missionary, his father joseph was alive. However, according to scripture, Joseph died between Jesus at age 8 or something and age 30 where his missionary began. I called Aubren University to get Keemstar on the phone so I can get on drama-alert about this. But the ♥♥♥♥♥ at the other end hung up.\n\nEverytime I attempted to take a screenshot of this master piece, it exitted me out of the game because you can't take a picture of the prophet Mohammad.\n\nThe enemy "Demons" if you wanna call them that were essentially different colored aliens in "Men in Black" suits.

But a very specilized and skillset that he worked 18 hours a day since the age of 4 to develop into making video games. Lets make a metaphor I.Q would be the size of a cutting object, and sharpness will be how developed the a video game developing skillset is. I'd say a Valve employee is like a razer sharp katana. And the developer for this game is a fork with diamond cutter sharpness. What do I mean to imply, not to be mean. But I think the developer has reached his pinnicle in developing his games. This is his masterpiece.\n\nI'm not taking the ♥♥♥♥ here but my I.Q is very low. But I ♥♥♥ on ♥♥♥♥♥ a lot so I know lots. About 12 hours a day everyday. I do it for pleasure. Not because I feel like I fit in. When i get depressed I visit it. I have no convictions, I don't have the reproduction mindset. So I'm completely fcked. Gosh I don't even remember memes. I.Q's low. I failed my drivers written test 10 times. There I proved it. Again, I don't have any ego on ♥♥♥♥♥. I do it of my own accord. And I don't think I'm being funny.\n\nI am very mad, this Jesus Christ game has trivilized not Christianity. But life itself. Why, the ♥♥♥♥ing citizens are drinking coffee. It shows, one thing. Not a funny, It shows the developer knows ♥♥♥ all about Ancient semetic culture. Knows not the ♥♥♥ what they drank, or ate. Knows not a ♥♥♥ what they talked or thought about deeply, knows actually he couldn't be bothered.\n\nIt's a game obviously, but the level of depression and retardation is beyond belief. The npc's the enemies lack any sort of unity, the games completely dysfunctional. I mean. I. Umm. I'm looking down in disappointment. You know why, I truly believe the developer put his heart and soul into this game because the quality jump from his previous game is immense. But It can't be coincidental. That such two games with jumps in quality are both intentionally bad.\n\nIs this game a trick from the Jews, to make us think, look I'm not a christian myself or anything. Is this game a trick from the Jews. I donno, I really don't know. Is it just a game, or is it. Meant to have a greater purpose. I really believe that. I really do. I'm not even trying to be funny here at last paragraph. You can be Polish and drink 3 bottles of vodka and say well.. It's just a game. I don't care. More important things, I think this game is an insult from the Jews. To show the future of mixed race video game development. It's like a subtle taunt to nationalists. You know. It's like. I am so ♥♥♥♥♥♥ depressed. I'm actually going to go sleep in my bed now. I have a headache, I am genuinely depressed. And this game broke my immersion for life. Not only for games. Wow. Just a game. Wow, happens all the time. But not on steam. And I don't actively look for crap. I'm not taking the ♥♥♥♥ as I mentioned before my I.Q is very low too I failed my drivers lesson 10 times too. So ultimately, it's an idiot complaining about an idiot developer. I'm so alone depressed. Got nothing to do. This game.

The first part you play as Mary, Joseph, and the 3 Wise Men.  The second follows Jesus's ministry, and the third his time in Jerusalem to his ressurection.   As far as gameplay goes its functional certainly.  No major glitches or anything.  The combat system is generally easy except for the boss fights which 3 of I actually died several times on.   This game doesn't set out to do much but what it does, it does so with mediocracy.   It finds itself on a a boundry where its neither hilariously bad nor good enough to really warrent a play.   Its just boring. If you're looking for a fun classic looking RPG, just pick up one of the Final Fantasies and don't waste your time here.   That being said it is again perfectly functional and if you want a game that plays out the life of Jesus I can recommend this.","March 20","false","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

'Jesus Christ RPG'...\n\nDeveloped and Published by Wholeton Games, and released for Free on Steam just in time for Easter here in 2016... 'Jesus Christ RPG' is perhaps the most surreal concept I've ever seen...\n\nIn short... it's Pokemon mixed with elements The Bible... okay that's silly... more like Final Fantasy meets The Bible.\n\nYeah that is as surreal as it sounds... as you level up 'Our Savior' he learns how to do his miracles (turn water to wine, heal the sick, etc, etc).... and you battle 'demons' while finding your apostles... and also recruiting your part (consisting of  Simon Peter, Mary Magdalene and Judus who joins you no matter if you like it or not)\n\nThe game is done on a turn base system, much like many other RPGs, you input your commands when it's your turn, there is some thinking involved to realize how to use everyone's abilities.\n\nControls are simple, you use the keyboard.... the arrow keys to navigate, enter to select menu options, the ESC key to bring up your inventory, save, status screens... and space bar to interact with objects and people.\n\nHowever it's the surreal nature of the game that makes it worth playing, there is an actual in-joke about the language (namely that they didn't speak English back in Biblical times), and Mary being apparently an overly common name.\n\nSince the game is free is worth checking out.","March 22","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sure it was somewhat boring at first and took quite a while to enjoy it. As the story progressed ( The story that all we know, even if you are not Christian), you will find that this game has a wonderful way to tell story, with mix of humour and a bit of twist and surprise.\n\nAbout the Graphic, it is simple on its way and don't make your eye hurt. Eventhough it uses 2d and some kind of 3d at the same time.\n\nThe music is good, but get annoyingly becasue the repetitive pattern. Still addictive though.\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone who have a little time to kill, because the gameplay didn't take long and simple as the usual pixel rpg\n\n*I just played this game for only two hours and had reached all the endings. But it dosen't change the fact that this review could be changed\n","March 26","true","3.1"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

The developers clearly did their historical and theological homework, which provides for some interesting gameplay mechanics and story progression, such as a detour to the Tower of Babel or playing as the magi, who derive their magical powers from weapons named after their gods. The plot stays mostly true to the Biblical account of Jesus' life and ministry (as far as I played, which is approximately halfway through), and depicting Satan as a corporate hack/ pimp with a suit and sunglasses is brilliant. However, the game mechanics are nonetheless shallow, and the potential for this to be an epic game on the scale of Super Mario RPG or Final Fantasy V falls short for a number of probable reasons (i.e. scope, commitment, software, etc.), but talent certaintly isn't one of them. The Tower of Babel could have been a world of its own had the developers given it more depth, and I would have liked to have seen a little more interactivity on par with some of Square's SNES games. The game is worth checking out since it's free, but I advise caution because one of the bosses, a giant mech called S.A.T.A.N., is unbeatable, preventing the player from experiencing the rest of the game. As a Christian, I liked the game and can tolerate its flaws. I suspect that the game may have actually been developed by Christians due to the accuracy of some theological elements and subtle commentary. Regardless, Christian developers should at least take note of this game and try not to overthink it. In the least, it may get nonbelievers engaged in the basics of Christianity, especially at a time when Biblical illiteracy and hatred of the Bible are at an all time high.","March 29","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The developers clearly did their historical and theological homework, which provides for some interesting gameplay mechanics and story progression, such as a detour to the Tower of Babel or playing as the magi, who derive their magical powers from weapons named after their gods. The plot stays mostly true to the Biblical account of Jesus' life and ministry (as far as I played, which is approximately halfway through), and depicting Satan as a corporate hack/ pimp with a suit and sunglasses is brilliant. However, the game mechanics are nonetheless shallow, and the potential for this to be an epic game on the scale of Super Mario RPG or Final Fantasy V falls short for a number of probable reasons (i.e. scope, commitment, software, etc.), but talent certaintly isn't one of them. The Tower of Babel could have been a world of its own had the developers given it more depth, and I would have liked to have seen a little more interactivity on par with some of Square's SNES games. The game is worth checking out since it's free, but I advise caution because one of the bosses, a giant mech called S.A.T.A.N., is unbeatable, preventing the player from experiencing the rest of the game. As a Christian, I liked the game and can tolerate its flaws. I suspect that the game may have actually been developed by Christians due to the accuracy of some theological elements and subtle commentary. Regardless, Christian developers should at least take note of this game and try not to overthink it. In the least, it may get nonbelievers engaged in the basics of Christianity, especially at a time when Biblical illiteracy and hatred of the Bible are at an all time high.","March 29","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The developers clearly did their historical and theological homework, which provides for some interesting gameplay mechanics and story progression, such as a detour to the Tower of Babel or playing as the magi, who derive their magical powers from weapons named after their gods. The plot stays mostly true to the Biblical account of Jesus' life and ministry (as far as I played, which is approximately halfway through), and depicting Satan as a corporate hack/ pimp with a suit and sunglasses is brilliant. However, the game mechanics are nonetheless shallow, and the potential for this to be an epic game on the scale of Super Mario RPG or Final Fantasy V falls short for a number of probable reasons (i.e. scope, commitment, software, etc.), but talent certaintly isn't one of them. The Tower of Babel could have been a world of its own had the developers given it more depth, and I would have liked to have seen a little more interactivity on par with some of Square's SNES games. The game is worth checking out since it's free, but I advise caution because one of the bosses, a giant mech called S.A.T.A.N., is unbeatable, preventing the player from experiencing the rest of the game. As a Christian, I liked the game and can tolerate its flaws. I suspect that the game may have actually been developed by Christians due to the accuracy of some theological elements and subtle commentary. Regardless, Christian developers should at least take note of this game and try not to overthink it. In the least, it may get nonbelievers engaged in the basics of Christianity, especially at a time when Biblical illiteracy and hatred of the Bible are at an all time high.","March 29","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I respect them for this. The very inclusion of the Harrowing of Hell in the last game, and the fact that they emphaise that St Dismas was the first to enter Heaven (a common theme of Orthodox Iconography) demonstrates the depth of this. This is also prevalent with the direct quotes on scripture in the other games and events such as the Miracles and Annunciation. I would have liked them to include the Psalmic verses and King David's dialogue with Satan in the Harrowing ("Open up your gates.." etc) but I suppose you can't always get what you want.","April 10","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
