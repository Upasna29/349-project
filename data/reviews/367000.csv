The game mechanics are similar to what you remember from the old Windows Minesweeper games, but with updated twists. A campaign mode has levels that get progressively harder, with cumulative scoring and timing. There are item drops, and you have the option to play in classic mode (in which hitting a mine will end the game and restart from the first level) or a mode in which you have multiple "lives" in which to carry on playing even if you hit an occasional mine. All of this is packaged in a slick interface, at least comparatively. Not everything is brand new though, it's every bit as addictive as the original.","May 30, 2015","true","2.0"," 47 of 51 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","47","51","0","2"

Started playing and the music came on. It's very well done and catchy, though this and the sound effects can be muted. There is a life system in this game that I love. Instead of completing most of the puzzle then losing, you just lose a heart. Hearts and more heart slots can be found throughout the game, though picking them up is optional. There's a custom area where you can create your own levels and the main leveling system that progressively gets harder. Also because the dev is amazing, now on your first move, you get an area opened instead of just one block.

There are dozens of levels now instead of just three, Steam leaderboards to show off with, and the options and controls are just like how you remember them. (Plus, it's got a nice background track that sounds roughly like a cat playing Team Fortress 2.)\n\nThat being said, Minesweeper is much more boring than I remember it. It's mostly just a game of matching: spotting which numbers on the board are equal to the amount of adjacent tiles or flagged mines. The only real puzzle aspect to Minesweeper comes when you've spotted all the possible matches, and the only way to progress is to use some deductive reasoning on the remaining numbers. But no matter how hard you try, if there are too many mines clustered together in the wrong way, you're eventually going to have to start guessing, and that's ultimately Minesweeper's biggest downfall.\n\nLuckily, Fine Sweeper gives you lives, so you can step on multiple mines on a level and still keep going. This introduces a completely new skill to the game: when stuck in a guessing situation, instead of just clicking and hoping you don't die, you have to pick the option that would give you the most useful information in a single click. It's a pretty nice touch and it feels like a good evolution of the game of Minesweeper.\n\nBut eventually the game starts cranking up the number of mines, enough to remind you of that one time you thought it would be hilarious to make a custom Minesweeper game with the maximum amount of mines, and then soon realized it was completely pointless and impossible. Despite the designer's attempts to balance the difficulty, it's inevitable in Minesweeper that you're going to have to guess a whole lot. But that's a problem with Minesweeper itself, and so this remake shouldn't really be held accountable for it.\n\nAlthough, it makes me wonder if the level generator could have included a bot that plays through the stage before it is presented, to make sure there are no necessary guesses. Or if there could be seeded boards with an automatic first click that are verified possible without guessing. But even though Fine Sweeper doesn't go all-out in bringing Minesweeper into the HD age, it's still good enough to be worth your time if you were, or still are, a huge fan of the old Windows games; it is a notable improvement on them.","July 2, 2015","true","54.4"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","12","12","2","2"

Hey sweeper...\nFine sweeper, a game that some would say has been a long time coming, and a game that really should have been done by now. A simple, clean modernisation of Minesweeper. It has mines, it has sweeps, it has some nice extra features, it has music, it has a couple of really fun animations (the mines go boom), the playfields change as you work your way through the levels.\n\nThe Minesweeper we wanted, and the Minesweeper we deserved...\nIt's Minesweeper. The core gameplay is as old as the hills so I won't belabour that. What's been added, well, aside from the classic game mode, the "Fine Sweeper" mode gives you lives, so if you accidentally blow a mine it may not be the end of the day, you may carry your lives between levels, giving you up to a maximum of seven do-overs before the game ends, and you may retry up to the last level you failed on. The custom mode allows you to set the size of the field and the number of mines, so that's pretty standard, and it has the basic options for sound and music (yes, we have music AT LAST, and it's pretty good).\n\nFinely swept and finely polished...\nConsidering this could have been a simple retooling of Minesweeper with a marginal graphics polish, Fine Sweeper has actually been a very pleasant surprise, it feels like a genuine coat of polish has been applied and it feels a lot more up to date from the original that we've been used to seeing on almost every version of Windows since day dot. Considering the price is absolutely minimal, this makes it a very nice value proposition for anyone looking for a "premium" minesweeper experience. Seriously, it's a good deal, try it!\n\nVerdict : Highly Recommended","May 26, 2015","true","1.0"," 33 of 50 people (66%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","66","33","50","12","6"

It sticks to the well-known basics of the game, but brings it to a far grander scale, the only item drops that the description mentions being extra lives (and some canisters to hold your extra lives early on), which is just as it should be.\n\nAnd you'll need them all, you really will, the global 'record' seems to be level 67 right now which only two people have gotten, and I'm currently working on level 59, and I'm facing a 36x22 board with 219 bombs to flag and 7 lives (plus any others you find on the map) to do it with.\n\nYou'll learn so many new tricks and logical leaps out of necessity as to how to figure out the status of squares and try to narrow down the number of 50-50 guesses you have to make, which is why you have that many lives. It's a really engaging non-time-constrained puzzle game, exactly the kind of game that I love running in the background while I do or watch other stuff. Who knew Minesweeper could be so fun?\n\nI didn't run into any bugs or glitches or have any complaint about the UI of the game. Yet. (Edit: I now have run headlong into a fairly major bug but the devs seem responsive and are working on it. (Edit: They fixed it!))

Not sure why this wasn't included from the start, since otherwise you are taking random guesses and unfairly losing lives (albeit there are some situations you have to guess no matter what, but the first click shouldn't be it).\n\nWhen you set off a bomb it changes the numbers around the explosion--When this first happened and a 2 changed to a 1, I didn't realise and thought "Oh, so the bomb went off on the one so I'll free these other spaces around the 1" and then set off another bomb. Maybe some people prefer this but I feel like it's misleading and completely interrupts my flow and I have to re-read the board to make sure the numbers that may have changed don't have the appropriate amount of flags already.\n\nAlong with this, when a bomb explodes, the numbers underneath are barely readable. As well as numbers underneath heart pickups, and the very font to be honest is a bit poor. I would much prefer a clear-cut font like the font used to display the amount of bombs left on the map to be used, perhaps it can be a customisable option or something.\n\nThe Game Over screen completely covers the board when you die, which is frustrating because you can't see your mistake and learn from it.\n\nAnd finally, I looked at the 'things to come' screenshot quickly from the Dev (couldn't find a list of things he's patching otherwise I might have left some things off this list if he's patching them) but the colour contrast on the new colours for numbers looks quite poor and hard to read on darker levels--while not officially a thing that can be reviewed right now since it's not even in the game, I thought on the off-chance the dev reads this he can brighten up the colours for the numbers a bit.\n\nCriticism aside, it's a nice looking iteration of Minesweeper and £1.59 isn't much to pay for a game which you can easily lose 30 mins or so of your day every time you load it, which adds up if you pace yourself. I would recommend, and I hope the dev updates it to become even more polished.\n\nI would love to see more illustrations from the artist featured in the game some how too, they are quite lovely.","May 27, 2015","true","5.6"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

I think most people on the planet know of it's existence since Windows 95. It was once a way to cure boredom, something to do when parents were on the phone and stopped you from using the internet, or when the internet just decided to drop. Most people, at some point or another have played it for whatever reason..\n\nStill with the same rule; avoid mines at all costs.\n\nNow, it returns with an updated face, more levels, awesome sounds - along with a catchy tune to play it to and different backgrounds per game.\n\nReturn to the rage with Fine Sweeper. The original Minesweeper with a few extra twists that make it even more addictive but also more infuriating. Giving a little bit more of a chance to progress easier with life pick-ups and pick-ups to make your heart bar grow, it also comes adapted with; item drops, leader-boards, trading cards and achievements.\n\nHowever, something they seem to have left out in Fine Sweeper is a good start, which I believe was introduced from Windows Vista on. While Fine Sweeper does seem to mostly prevent the first click from being a mine, it's quite likely that the clicked square is a 1 or greater, meaning you'll have to click somewhere else on the board randomly until you finally do find a good place to start, this was a slight embuggerance when it came to starting and instantly loosing a heart due to it being a bomb, or just hitting endless numbers higher than a 0.\n\nNone the less, new or old fan of Minesweeper, this is a great add to your library.

There isn't enough new and the new stuff isn't up to a good enough standard.\n\nAs soon as I saw this game on steam I had to buy it. I am a huge minesweeper fan and I just couldn't pass up a new version of it being released. However this game isn't much better than the original.\n\nThe main mode that this version features is a continuous mode. This mode continues going with levels of increasing difficulty. They basically increase the difficulty by growing the board size and adding more bombs. The score increases as a sum of all the levels you do and it measures the time you take on each level. This is incorperated into a high score system that lets you compare your score with friends and other people. This is a nice addition that gives a new reason to play minesweeper.\n\nHowever the problem with this mode is that there is no way to save it. I found myself going on a continuous run for over an hour earlier today. At that point I was getting pretty tired of it. I would have liked to quit the game and continue it later. But this wasn't possible since the game offers no way of saving it.\n\nBut this isn't the biggest problem the game has. It is horrible to play as you get further into the game with bigger boards. It is basically a guessing game at this point. Very little skill is involved. This is because the game puts you in situations where no amount of skill will let you figure out where there is a bomb and where there isn't so instead you just have to guess and hope for the best. I know this was a problem in the original minesweeper, but it definitely wasn't as big as a problem as it is in this game. When you get later into the game, i'd say around level 30ish, you start having to guess so often! This wasn't a fun experience and it isn't in the true light of minesweeper to have to guess instead of use skill.\n\nThe game does attempt to counteract this problem in a way. They use a life system. You find lives under blocks that you clear on the level which you can add to your collection. Everytime you hit a bomb you loose a life. Some people that are perhaps less skilled at minesweeper may like this addition. But to a hardcore player who has been playing for a long time this isn't of much use to me. I would much prefer to have only one life. I would prefer it if they would fix the guessing issue instead of using this lazy alternative to fix it. They don't even have an option to disable the life system which I would have done.\n\nWhat I used to love about the original minesweeper is the ginourmous size boards you could make and play on. Whenever I played it I used to make one of the biggest boards possible and then I would end up playing for about half an hour or so just on the one board. Fine sweeper features a similar mode to setup a custom sized board. But is no where near the scale that you can do on traditional minesweeper. In fact the boards are puny in size compared to the original. It's quite laughable to see it actually. Even when you go to the biggest scale possible. I have no idea why the developer limited it so much!\n\nThe options menu of the game is also extremely lacking. The only option of note is the audio sliders of which there is a seperate one for music and for other sounds. It's also probably worth noting that the music and sounds aren't particularly good in my opinion. I had them off for my entire time playing it. And the only other option there really is the nostalgic colours  option. That is it. They could at very least have some resolution options or something else!\n\nThere was only one thing in this game that I could find that may lead you to play this instead of the original minesweeper. The graphics. They are such an improvement over the classic original minesweeper. Although i'm sure you really need it to play a simple game like this. If only the developer could have put as much effort into making the game unique and work properly as they put in on the graphics!\n\nOverall I cannot recommend this game. There are so many issues that it isn't actually fun to play. Theres not enough different for anyone to even consider playing it over the original. I am gonna go back to playing the original as well and I think you should to. I would also like to take the time here to recommend a great alternative to minesweeper that improves drastically on the original formula and of which I greatly enjoyed called "hexcells". If your a minesweeper fan and your wanting something new go and try that instead of this game.\n\nTheIronicGamers rating system Don't ever buy this game.\nMaybe consider it on a sale.\nAn average game.\nA good game that should definitely be considered.\nA must play!","May 29, 2015","false","1.6"," 14 of 22 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","14","22","2","4"

It's not blowing the doors off in any way, nice visuals do help the game but in the end, it's not breaking any walls in terms of gameplay. I do admit the right click feature on the numbers is nice in terms of revealing, that's a plus that I don't remember in the  original Windows 3.1 on the game. More features on the high score table would have been nice however, and overall, if you didn't like Minesweeper, there's nothing here to draw your attention, and you wanted a real advanced version of minesweeper, you'd be better looking at something like ManaCollect. But solid, and given the price tag, reasonable.\n\n+:\nIt's Minesweeper.\nI may be wrong on this but I don't think I am: the right click feature added to click on numbers to automatically reveal spaces if the number quota has been filled is quite nice.\nDo like the lives system, and a good last minute addition in the Classic Mode is good for nostalgia purposes.\nVisuals are strong, with good color choices and makes it feel great.\nMusic, while not having a lot of variety, didn't actually get old surprisingly. Was catchy in a way.\nCustom mode is nice.\nDeveloper was extremely responsive on info that came up during my play sessions, which is always a plus.\n-:\nIt's Minesweeper.\nNeeded a counter to count how many flags you've placed down so far, or you're just really counting mines for no reason. This is especially important later on in levels.\nMore leaderboard sorting options and detail would have been nice to see.\nI saw the word powerups, but it's basically lives.

The game is immediately familiar to anyone who’s played Minesweeper, and it also has a tutorial for anyone who hasn’t.\n\nThe main mode of the game is a “campaign” style mode – you basically start with a tiny board to clear, and each time you win you progress to a slightly more difficult board (the backgrounds and colors vary as well). Pretty soon (and I do mean soon, it doesn’t take long to progress through the early levels) you’ll be playing on boards even more difficult than the “Expert” boards from Minesweeper. As you play through the campaign, you earn points for each mine you flag and each board you clear – and you can compare your scores to other players’ on the leaderboards.\n\nThis leads me to my only complaint – there’s no way to save your campaign progress. When you quit the campaign, your score is reset. You can still start at the highest level you’ve unlocked, but your score starts at zero. A single save slot would allow you to continue the game through more than one session.\n\nAs you play, you randomly unlock and find lives, which are used up whenever you detonate a mine. This single-handedly fixes the main frustration I have with Minesweeper – there’s no second chance if you guess wrong. Of course, once you run out of lives your game is over, but at least some of the frustration has been alleviated.\n\nCustom game boards are included, so you’re able to create your own challenges. And if you’re not a fan of the new lives mechanic, you can play in “Classic” mode to disable it. The developer has proven to be very responsive as well, pushing out updates quickly and regularly based directly on community feedback.\n\nFine Sweeper provides a comprehensive Minesweeper package and improves on the classic. It’s more than worth the low price point.\n\nFull review[www.thesewall.com].","June 29, 2015","true","27.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

It also starts out very easy and takes a long time to build up to any real difficulty, although that is a matter entirely of personal preference.\n\nOn the other hand, if the idea of a game of minesweeper with a few app-like elements (added lives, some sort of social score thing popping up telling you how far ahead of other players you are etc.) appeals to you then this is a good implementation of this.\n\nOverall, I'd say go for the Hexcells series if you want carefully crafted, more cerebral levels with absolutely no guessing and a higher difficulty threshold, but if you just want to sit and click in a faster-paced way then this may be the game for you. It's kind of the Bejeweled Blitz of Minesweeper clones.","June 19, 2015","true","0.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Just be sure you marked the right tiles or the revealed bomb will detonate.  If you do not have the correct number of marked/flagged tiles around a number tile you can safely right-click on it to hilight the surrounding tiles and no new tiles will clear.  This feature increases the flow of the game tremendously.\n\nHealth:\nEach time you detonate a bomb, you will lose a heart.  Lose all of your heats and it's game over.  When clearing tiles, replacement hearts will randomly appear as well as extra heart tiles to increase your total number of hearts up to seven.  I really like this approach, but I feel the game is too generous with how many hearts it gives you.  This makes the game a bit too easy.  It removes the tension you normally get when you play classic Mine Sweeper and you don't know if you are a mouse-click away from your explosive doom.\n\nGraphics:\nSimple space background graphics.  The planets are drawn crudely.  Subtle animated smoke and dust effects when tiles are cleared and when bombs detonate.  There is room for improvement, however:  Early levels (below 35 or so) have fewer total tiles.  The smaller tile graphics from later levels are used in these early levels and scaled up.  This makes the graphics look soft.  After you reach level ~35 everything looks sharper because everything is displayed in actual size.  Separate, larger tiles should have been created for these early levels so the graphics could look just as sharp as they look in later levels.  The entire game download is under 60 megabytes.  The developer had no reason not to create an extra set of larger tiles.\n\nAside from the soft graphics I meantioned just one paragraph ago (Remember?), the presentation is decent.  It could have looked even better with more dynamic lighting.  The tiles in this game are all evenly lit making them look like they could have been presented on a 16-bit console (other than the smoke and particle effects).\n\nThe game does present some fun graphics pop-ups that appear with certain achievements along with animated fireworks.  If you have any achievements in Pinball FX2 you know exactly what I am talking about.\n\nThe game has modes other than classic mine sweeper, but I have not tried them yet.  I've reached level 38 in the main game and I can easily recommend this game for it's low price, clean presentation and the auto-clearing feature.","November 8, 2015","true","13.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","2"

And on most accounts it is, with visually appealing graphics, increasing difficulty, a life system, and an actually included right click number mechanic (although that really should be double left click). However, there is one major flaw. In Minesweeper, the first square you click should always be an empty space. Every. Single. Time. This accomplishes two things - one, making sure you don't hit a bomb on your first click, and second, setting up the rest of the board so you don't have take a leap of faith on you're second click. Somehow, the developer managed to miss this crucial game mechanic, that quite frankly makes the game infuriating and unplayable without. This game also suffers from a lack of features, some promised and some that can be found on free javascript versions online. The promotional video promises "heath pick ups and power ups," but only delivers on the first of those promises. The so called "custom" game mode only allows a laughable 18x11 grid. It has a pause function, but the only way it can be activated is if the window looses focus. Since I would not recommend anyone wasting $2 on this unfinished game, and you've made it this far, if you're looking for a minesweeper with more features and customization then you know what to do with, I'd suggest Mines from Simon Tatham's Portable Puzzle Collection. If you're looking for a visually appealing and highly polished version of minesweeper, go download Microsoft's version from the windows store.

I am of course talking about Solitaire and Minesweeper. Solitaire has already seen several enjoyable re-workings, but now it's Minesweeper's time to shine with a modern update in the form of Fine Sweeper. And you know what?... It ain't half bad.\n\nPresented with a grid full of square panels that are hiding several mines underneath, you click on a panel and reveal some blank spaces and some numbers. Each number represents how many mines surround that tile, and based on that information, you must deduce the locations of every mine and avoid them as you click and remove all the unoccupied panels on the board. With each cleared grid, you move on to another that's either bigger and/or has more mines hiding from you. Make a mistake and you'll have a fully primed ball explode in your face. Do that several times, and it's game over.\n\nThe difference with this update is it's far more lenient than its original granddaddy. You now have hearts that allow you some breathing room where each heart will give you a free pass should you click on a mine, more of which can be found hiding under some random squares that can be used to replenish your stock and give you more room for mistakes. Or, alternatively, instead of using them you can save them in a bank and eventually cash them in for special, one-time use abilities to help you clear the board. And for hardcore score enthusiasts, this version has scoreboards for you, too, along with additional methods of play available to maximise that goal.\n\nA little extra flair is added with some clean, appealing visuals (the grid and its surrounding boarder resembling the top-down dungeons from the original NES Zelda) and some funky bass licks to keep the mood up from stage to stage. It's all perfectly pleasant and functional and serves as a nice, relaxed, modern take on a fun but dated classic. I'm not sure how many stages there are, as I stopped at the 50 required for the achievements, but with multiple stages of increasing difficulty, a custom mode with sliding scales of variables, and a sweet little price to boot, for fans of Minesweeper, whatever your flavour is, this has you covered. Although, even in this updated version, clicking on the wrong mine in a final 50/50 situation and wasting the past 20 minutes of your life never stops hurting.","May 17","true","20.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","3","3","2","0"

Been playing it on and off rather addictively for the last month or so, most of that due to my unrelenting addiction for minesweeper (and achievements) as well as just wanting to top those leaderboards to make my life seem less worthless...\n\nThis is the best minesweeper remake I've ever played, it is a hell of a lot better then the windows remake that was on the windows store (not sure if they actually made it) which was a tragedy, I don't cry (much) but playing that reduced me too tears and almost lead me down a road of drink and drugs. Like that one this too had pickups, which is an obviously new addition to the classic minesweeper formula and whilst I was pretty skeptical at first it's a very well incorporated addition unlike the other version. There is also classic mode where you only have 1 life and therefore you hit a bomb you die (just like in real life!).\n\nThis game has unlimited levelling (until I assume the board is literally just mines) but post level 60, odds are you're going to find it very hard to complete it. This put me off a little at first, since the game then revolved too heavily on luck and not skill but then if it'd be far too easy if everything was solvable by skill, there's not much to really make harder regarding skill in minesweeper.\nThe sheer difficulty of the higher levels have made me a much better player as I was forced to find new ways and rules to find bombs, which is something games won't normally do!\n\nThe graphics are nice but not too distracting and veer too far from the original minecraft, in other words there is nothing over the top and 'included because it's eye candy and omg luk at dem 4k textures'... Sounds are fine, bombs give a nice explosion (and leave a crater in the board) which can be quite unnerving when you're really focusing which brings a lot of tension to the game.\n\nThe devs seem to very active, I've seen a lot of activity in the forums from them and they seem to answer and adress the majority of problems that appear which is great. They seem to really care about the game and are not looking for quick monies, especially considering the price!\n\nFor £1.99 this is a steal, I think I got this in a greenlight bundle so I paid a lot less and feel like I robbed the devs and also took there clothes but I'd pay at least full price considering I've got 50 hours out of it and I don't feel like I'm going to be uninstalling anytime soon (#1 spot on the leader board here I come!). Even if you are not human and didn't enjoy the original minesweeper, you should still pick this up if you even have the very least bit of passing interest in minesweeper. Recent update made the earlier levels a lot easier so it starts off as a very casual game, perfect for wasting time!","July 12, 2015","true","187.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

You HAVE to purposely die so you can select a new game. Otherwhise your only option is to 'resume' the old game.\n\n","May 22","true","13.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","1"

While going full speed, I'll accidentally put a marker in the wrong spot, and when I let go to fix it, I've inevitably moved a bit and do a check while releasing the button, thus costing me a life.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/category-theory/recommended/367000/","category-theory","Category Theory","http://steamcommunity.com/id/category-theory/","662 products in account","Well, first, it's Minesweeper. If you're not in to the game in general, this version of it is unlikely to change your mind.\n\nIf you do like it, however, this is one of the better versions around. They offer a "classic mode" which is pretty similar to the original Windows version, and their own variation which is arguably better. I'll concentrate on that in the remainder of this review.\n\nThe major change is that you now get lives (hearts), of which you can have up to seven, allowing you to detonate seven bombs before the game terminates. Extra lives are dropped as you progress so if you're careful you should be able to handle five or so detonations per level indefinitely. While some might lament the loss of tension in this mechanic as compared to the traditional "instant game over" from a single detonation, there are situations where you simply can't know which of two possible layouts you're looking at, and you have to guess. Being able to do this makes the game less luck- and more skill-based, and also introduces the new mechanic of figuring out, when you do have to risk exploding something, what will leave you in the best shape after that move.\n\nAlong these lines too, they also appear to have removed both any chance of detonating a mine on your first move and the possibility of first moves that don't open the board enough for you to make an intelligent next move, as opposed to a guess. (I presume they do this by building the board only after you've chosen your first move.) Again, this shifts the game away from luck and more towards skill.\n\nThe standard "campaign" game has you clearing levels, starting with a small (5x5) grid where you need to flag three bombs, and eventually moving up to a full 20x40 grid with dozens of bombs. This gives a nice feeling of progression, and also makes things rather interesting and different from the original gameplay once you reach level forty, where you have to deal with a much higher bomb density (hundreds) than the original game ever offered. You can stop playing at any time and it will restart where you left off when you come back to the game. If your game ends, and you restart again from the main menu, you'll be prompted to start at any level you like up to the highest level you've ever reached.\n\nThe graphics are pretty decent, without being distracting, and I particularly appreciated their well done auto-open highlight. I use it a lot, and it's nice that it's easy to read in this game. (Auto-open is when you middle or right click an open cell to automatically open all non-flagged cells around it. If you don't have exactly the number of surrounding cells flagged as indicated in the cell on which you're clicking, you'll see a highlight of all unopened cells, allowing you to quickly and easily concentrate on the ones you need to flag.)\n\nCustom modes, where you set the board size and number of bombs, are also available, and there's are also simple global and friends list leaderboards for comparing your score (which appears to be based on several factors, including what you expose and how many bombs you explode, but not on time taken). There's also a reasonable selection of achievements, and Steam trading cards.\n\nAll in all, this is a nice little time killer, and at $3 or less I think it's priced perfectly for what it is.","November 30, 2015","true","7.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

However I am hitting my head against a minor usability flaw (as I see it) which is preventing my full appreciation.  When you click on a bomb, that bomb is replaced by a number and other numbers near it change as a result.  I understand the concept of "it blew up so it's not there anymore", but I'm not sure this behavior really adds much to the game.  In fact, 1) I have to question now what a number on an exploded bomb means, which can get confusing as you ponder whether to count the square its on, and 2) when you're deep in analysis of board state and click on a bomb, now your numbers have all changed making it a) really annoying to figure out WHY you made a mistake ("Now, what were those #'s??") and b) forces you to recalculate other moves you were pondering in the area.  I don't think that was actually your intended goal, but for me it jolts the user out of his/her focus.  Additionally, you don't need the number that replaces the bomb anyway, a person is trying their hardest to avoid all those locations already.  Would be nice to toggle this behavior in options so bombs you click on just stay... bomb blasts and no numbers appear or change.

Of course, there's also Classic mode, which is without the lives like the original Minesweeper.\n\nThere's some convenience features, like if there's already a marked bomb next to a "1" for example, you can right click the "1" to auto reveal all tiles around it. Of course, if you marked the wrong tile you'll hit a bomb, but it makes things quite more fluid. Also, they altered it a bit so that the first click on a level  never hits a bomb.\n\nYou start at level 1, and as you beat levels it gets increasingly harder and harder. Once you've beaten a level, you can choose to start at that level so you don't need to start at the beginning every time.\n\nMy only complaint is that you cant save games in progress, so if you want to start at level 1 and see how far you can get, you have to finish that challenge in one sitting, else you'll either have to start over, or start at the last level you remember, which resets the score.\n\nIf you like Minesweeper, then this game is definitely worth the cheap price.","June 27, 2015","true","4.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I would like to say to anyone considering buying this game that this game is not a big Minesweeper overhaul or improvement: it just adds a neat little feature to it.\n\nWhile my biggest complaint has been fixed, a few other do remain. This would include the lack of statistics (e.g. games played/won/lost; I do not mean a leaderboard), the ability to replay the same level (without the level regenerating), the ability to look at the board after having lost a game (to see what went wrong; currently a message box saying 'Game Over' is in the way) and lastly a fix for unsolvable levels.\nThese first three functions have been included in earlier versions of Microsoft Minesweeper, but the fourth one would definitely be a big improvement over Microsoft's game.\n\nOf course, the game also has functions that Microsoft did not put in their game, namely multiple lives (clicking a mine does not end the current game) , online leaderboards, achievements and a variety of levels.\n\nPerhaps that these things will be fixed/added with the next patch. But until then, I can say that I would recommend Fine Sweeper, keeping in mind that Microsoft Minesweeper is still a strong rival.","May 26, 2015","true","4.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","4"

Granted, you're going to have better than 50/50 odds on lots of guesses, but many guesses are no more than straight coin flips.  At level 20, the game stops being about skill, and transforms into a game of luck, whether it's if you can run hot at coin flipping, or whether you're fortunate enough to encounter lots of arbitrary heart health drops when you get in trouble.  Reaching level 20 in campaign mode is elementary for a skilled player, and since your health is fully replenished every ten levels (you receive full health at the start of level 20), plowing through levels 1 through 19 becomes tiring and is a pointless chore (but a necessary chore since if you're aiming for a high score, starting at level 1 will earn you the most cumulative points).  In levels 1 through 19, there is no reason to be careful with your clicks, not only because of too frequent health drops, but because at level 20 you're going to get all your health back anyway.\n\nThe one quantifier which made the original Minesweeper competitive, speed, seems to be completely neglected in this game.  I can't see any correlation between how fast you can sweep a board and scoring a higher number of points.\n\nI've played more Minesweeper in my life than I care to admit; my fastest time on "Expert" in the Windows game is somewhere barely over 60 seconds.  As of the June 3rd writing of this review, I have the fourth highest campaign score on the leaderboard at 379,984.  That score would be a lot lower if on that particular run for a time being a divine entity had not told me which tiles to guess, and would be higher if I didn't lose three straight 50/50 coin flips at the very end of a level, which prevented me from clearing that particular stage and getting a large bonus.  At its low price I think that most people will get good value out of this game, however not even the most enthusiastic of Minesweeper fans will be piling up a ton of hours on this game.\n\nRecommendations I would make to the developers:\n- Make heart drops less frequent in low levels (1-19), and a little more frequent in difficult levels (20+)\n- Make the penalty for triggering a bomb greater, losing points for stepping on a bomb is meaningless if you can reclaim those same points by clicking on a heart\n- Eliminate health being fully replenished on levels divisible by ten\n- Have the time you take to clear the board reflected in a multiplier for your score, the faster your time the higher your multiple\n- In campaign mode, sometimes after clearing a board, it will have me immediately repeat the same level, sometimes more than once.  I'm not sure why this is, but I don't see the point of it, and it becomes tedious, so I would recommend eliminating that feature.","June 3, 2015","false","11.3"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","1"

By adding a health mechanic, it adds more forgiveness with mistakes, but for seasoned MineSweeper players this only means that you can plow through certain parts that you would otherwise have to logic out.\n\n2. The music is sub-par.\n\nThere are many far better games to play in this genre. HexCells is front and center for me. With Fine Sweeper, you can get yourself into situations where you have to guess where a mine is, where in games like HexCells there is NEVER a need for guessing.\n\nNothing makes Fine Sweeper stand above its predecessor, and the new additions sound good, but don't translate well into the game.","May 31, 2015","false","0.5"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","43","3","7","2","1"

The layout is good and the ability to get a start is a a jump ahead of the traditional minesweeper.  The graphics are improved as well.\n\nHowever, it is frustrating in the extreme when a bomb explodes and interferes with your ability to view the screen data.  Because of this the hearts that are given, (and not explained in the tutorial), are useless as the numbers are out of whack and you can't clearly see the field of play, (good vision is a most important aspect of playing a very visual game).  I was hoping for something that would be more manageable to play and be less frustrating.\n\nIn summary: You get a better looking mine sweeper game with a better starting move and the ability to custom make your screens.  I just sish that the hearts could be meaningfully used to complete a minefield and go on to the next.","June 26, 2015","true","76.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Plus, maybe i'm just hallucinating, but in Fine Sweeper i had less coin flip situations.\n\nHowever, the issue I have with the game is that the cursor snaps to grid, which makes controls really weird, and caused most deaths for me, or I end up wasting a lot time to correct a mistake, if I noticed it before next click.

There has to be something as it´s based on a free game that is furthermore already installed on every windows pc out there.\nWell, there is a mode with more lives so you don´t die instantly, tho as a hardcore Minesweeper lover, that´s nothing for me.\nOne thing they did well is the first click: it is guaranteed to give you a start, and yes while this is not really innovative as other games did it as well by already revealing an area at the start, it´s definetly a feature that´s missing in Minesweeper...\n\nTho they forgot to change the biggest flaw of Minesweeper. If they had done that, i´d blindly recommend the game to anyone who likes Minesweeper... but they didnt: You still have to guess.\nThe more mines you add, the higher the probability of you having to guess meaning that the later stages will have a near to 100% chance that you will need to guess AT LEAST once, if not more times.\n\nAnd as in any game: the word random should not be able to describe the game. Be it Hearthstone (a Hearthstone referene from a Minesweeper review, yes i did it) or any other game, it will decrease the value by an extreme amount.\nSo no, i can´t recommend you to buy this game, as it´s essentially the same game as the free version you probably already have installed...\n\nNote: You can´t tell me there is no algorithm for placing the bombs in a way that you don´t have to guess. "Hexcells: Infinite" did it and they had a far more complex ruleset to work with. So yeah, i will just keep waiting until someone may eventually release this game without having to guess, until then, play something else...","July 6, 2015","false","1.8"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

I was expecting more game modes or variations on the game.\n\nI got this on a bundle so I'm quite happy with it, but for full price, maybe minimum 50% sale before I can recommend purchasing it.","September 30, 2015","false","17.5"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","3","11","0","0"
