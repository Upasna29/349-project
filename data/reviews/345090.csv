"http://steamcommunity.com/id/linusolsson/recommended/345090/","linusolsson","Z0mBi3","http://steamcommunity.com/id/linusolsson/","2548 products in account","This is a fun little defense game with enough maps and upgrades to keep you playing for a while! Some upgrades are a little lazy though, like 10% more damage per time you upgrade. You build a base, which will gain energy or points for you to use for building towers, and other defensive things like land mines, stones, and slow turrents.\n\nTheres slow and fast enemies, some tanky and some weaker ones. You have to plan ahead and adjust your strategy depending on what kind of enemy you are up against. Towers attack fast, but doesn't do much physical damage, for example. You can always see what the next wave will contain of.\n\nAncient Planet have a story, but it's very simple. It's you getting attacked by some kind of robots and aliens and your job is to defend your big building. Some text-based story in between the missions, but its still the gameplay that keeps you playing.\n\nIs the game repetitive? Maybe a little. In the first missions they introduce a lot of new things, which keep things fresh, but in later levels I would say it's more repetitive. Game runs perfect though, and lets me move between my two monitors without the game tabbed down. It also automatically pauses when you click on your other screen, which is neat. Options are overall good.\n\nThis is something you should look into if your interested in tower defense games. Graphics looks good and the game has a helpful tutorial to get you started. This is quite easy to recommend, since the price is fairy low and the game is solid.","March 28, 2015","true","2.2"," 36 of 39 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","36","39","0","2"

K.","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197973230221/","3588 products in account","Moonlight Mouse first Steam Game is a interesting tower defense game. Sure its not revolution/ evolution but its deserve his place. The story is telled in short messages before every level and its okay enough. The graphics are for a low budget indie game fine, the enemy development is fantastic, sure could have a bit more like more boss enemies, but its really great, the tower could be a bit more and have more different attack types (elements like water, fire, lightning, stones, lasers or something but for a Indie Game its great. The upgrade system is a satisfied extra, but there could be even more upgrades, starting cheaper and the expensive ones get more effective so for each tower getting 20 updates that cost not to much, but i am happy with that one that is given. The level design is easy but everyone you need to start new to destroy buildings and try to find the best positions for your towers. Last point are the achievements, its great it has so many, but there could be even more like buying all upgrades, buying all upgrades each update part (tower, 2nd weapons, baseparts) or getting all stars or killing 10,50.100 tanks and not only 100 tanks, but its only a very little critic point. So i give this game 93 % for tower defense fans, 86 % for normal gamers and because its a bit hard in the mid and end levels and has no difficulty levels (easy, hard) i give 73 % for casual players (because maybe you need to farm some upgrades and that takes a bit and frustrating). For 5 euros its a cheap game, even if the main champain has only 35 missions, but you cant rush from one to another. 2 last point i miss is that the game has only normal speed and extra speed (good extra) but sometimes i wish a bit more extra speed even then because long ways and slow enemies or a 3-5 second rewind option for mistakes redo or a slow motion, but its fine, i enjoy this game and for people that want a challenge try to do the levels without a upgrade and i miss a bit highscores in games (own, international for every level and normal/ surivival).

While it doesn't do anything new or exciting, it does have everything a typical tower defense game usually has: towers you can unlock & upgrade, new enemies & behaviors, an in-game encyclopedia, and a rating scale (1-3 stars) that is awarded to you based on your performance.  Towers can be put anywhere, which is a nice touch (factories must be placed on deposits).  You can also replay levels you've beaten to earn more gems (to upgrade towers), though at a reduce rate.  All in all this isn't a bad little TD game, though it didn't "WOW" me in any particular way.  Still, I enjoyed my experience nonetheless.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_CGIrlI4W4\n","February 3, 2015","true","2.9"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","15","19","0","0"

Nice price, recommended if you don't mind grinding.\nAt one point it will become really difficult that is the reason you will need to grind for upgrades.\n\nPros\n\nSimple and well executed\nSatisfying to play and complete the missions/get achievements\nEnough variation to keep you engaged\n\nCons\n\nDon't play with sound on if you're playing for a while\nHave to do a lot of grinding to progress to end game content/get everything\n\nGameplay\n\nA simplistic tower defense game where you focus on shooting stupid aliens as they follow a path with the various defenses you can build around it. You have to choose whether to gain resources or defenses, like Plants Versus Zombies, and without knowing anything about the game and where it originated from, it feels like the kind of game you would play on your IPad. The invading alien army (armies) have the kind of derpy humour you would hope to see in creatures that will totally bypass your defense despite the horrific casualties and insist on going down a single path to your base.\nIt's entertaining and a nice little game for the casual gamer, with bite sized humour in-between the defense missions. If you like games such as Plants Versus Zombies, you'll like this.\n\nOnce you have your defenses built up, you have the option to speed up the game as well, which is a nice feature for those who feel they've maxed out ... or want more of a challenge. You can upgrade weapons with the gems you collect after each mission.\n\nOnce you've built your resource generators on specified areas of the map, the types of defenses you have are:\nBlock walls which will be attacked. Green gem things that are slow but strong, and quite long ranged/have a good field of coverage. Turrets that go pew pew. Stronger turrets that go pew pew pew. Blue floaty ice balls that slow the enemies. Zappy pew pew things. Mines that go boom when they walk over them. After a bit you'll start picking and choosing the defenses you build with the resources you have and the type of enemies you face, and needing to destroy structures that inhibit building your own.\n\nIt's really well done and ingenious for the simple mechanics it has, and as someone who enjoys this style of game, I like it. The sounds however can get a little annoying so you will likely find yourself muting the game and enjoying the visual impact better. I'm also not so sure about the grinding, I don't mind doing this, but I don't think I would want to play this game long enough to do some serious levelling. So for me, this game is not worth the amount of time put into it, but for those who like the dedication and result that comes from grinding, this is a nice pick for them.","April 10, 2015","true","56.8"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","100","10","10","5","0"

The one thing IMO to point out (which is good or bad depending on your own opinion) is the "forced" replay value, I had to play maps multiple times to earn enough credits to purchase tower/base/weapons upgrades so I could continue the campaign without either getting my butt kicked or figuring out that "perfect combination" of towers.

Now about bad part - game doesn't have any top scores, so there is not much point in trying your hardest on every map, but if you not planning on recompleting every map, it shouldn't matter. Next thing - amount of towers. There are only 8 of those, and 4 are possible improvements of 2 starting ones (altho each of 8 towers has an improvement tree).

Very challenging at times and super grindy just to advance. But its not a bad game. I actually had determination to finish the game and really tried to upgrade everything and get all achievements. and for me, that must mean something, because i do not ever do that for any game. But, i gave up right when i seen the finish line. Got all but 1 achievement and only need a few more towers to upgrade, but i just couldn't bear grinding anymore levels that i have completely mastered.\n\nThe worse part of the game is that there is no endgame, no hidden levels, no special something something for the winner, ect. So after grinding every single level and trying to stock up on gems just to get some mediocer upgrade boosts, you just want to give up. I say this is good for the first 15 hours at most then it loses everything it had.\n\nBut not all is lost, i still recommend this game to anyone who has interest ind Tower Defense Games. I think if the Devs take one more shot at a good Patch or update to fix some of the unbalance issues with monsters vs. upgrades, ect and adds some type of endgame, this would be a really good game.

Nice price, recommended if you don't mind grinding.\nAt one point it will become really difficult that is the reason you will need to grind for upgrades.\n\nPros\n\nSimple and well executed\nSatisfying to play and complete the missions/get achievements\nEnough variation to keep you engaged\n\nCons\n\nDon't play with sound on if you're playing for a while\nHave to do a lot of grinding to progress to end game content/get everything\n\nGameplay\nA simplistic tower defense game where you focus on shooting stupid aliens as they follow a path with the various defenses you can build around it. You have to choose whether to gain resources or defenses, like Plants Versus Zombies, and without knowing anything about the game and where it originated from, it feels like the kind of game you would play on your IPad. The invading alien army (armies) have the kind of derpy humour you would hope to see in creatures that will totally bypass your defense despite the horrific casualties and insist on going down a single path to your base.\nIt's entertaining and a nice little game for the casual gamer, with bite sized humour in-between the defense missions. If you like games such as Plants Versus Zombies, you'll like this.\n\nOnce you have your defenses built up, you have the option to speed up the game as well, which is a nice feature for those who feel they've maxed out ... or want more of a challenge. You can upgrade weapons with the gems you collect after each mission.\n\nOnce you've built your resource generators on specified areas of the map, the types of defenses you have are:\nBlock walls which will be attacked. Green gem things that are slow but strong, and quite long ranged/have a good field of coverage. Turrets that go pew pew. Stronger turrets that go pew pew pew. Blue floaty ice balls that slow the enemies. Zappy pew pew things. Mines that go boom when they walk over them. After a bit you'll start picking and choosing the defenses you build with the resources you have and the type of enemies you face, and needing to destroy structures that inhibit building your own.\n\nIt's really well done and ingenious for the simple mechanics it has, and as someone who enjoys this style of game, I like it. The sounds however can get a little annoying so you will likely find yourself muting the game and enjoying the visual impact better. I'm also not so sure about the grinding, I don't mind doing this, but I don't think I would want to play this game long enough to do some serious levelling. So for me, this game is not worth the amount of time put into it, but for those who like the dedication and result that comes from grinding, this is a nice pick for them.\n\n\nWant to read more of my reviews?

It's your usual casual tower defense game that gets lumped in with bundle after bundle. All of these games are, by and large, the same thing. You place towers, upgrade them, fight off waves of enemies, win, lose, retry, etc.\n\nWhat stands out about this particular title?\nNothing, really. That's not to say it's a bad game. It's okay, but you're not going to be awed by the thing and play it for an entire day straight. These games are addictive, but with so many of the same thing out there, after you play one or two of them it really just doesn't matter, anymore. Even point and click games have storylines, and none of these really do. You have a tower, defend it by building guns. Defend it more by upgrading those guns. Like I said, nothing special.\n\nOverall\nIf you're really, really into tower defense games - pick it up. Or, if it's included in a bundle, it's definitely worth it. It's nothing special, but it's not a bad game.\n\n6/10 - Acceptable, works well, easy to pick up and play.","May 3, 2015","true","2.0"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

It´s not the easiest one to beat, but not very hard either. Some people say it´s a grind to beat the harder levels. I never needed to grind to be able to complete the game. Took me around 15 hours. Just get 3 stars on every map and carefully use the right towers/skills to get the job done.\n\nOn my pc it runs great and looks amazing. The gameplay and controls feels clumsy though. I assume it´s developed for mobile devices as there is no hotkeys. How can you make a PC game with no hotkeys? I would recommend this game if you completed Gemcraft Chasing Shadows and is looking for another tower defense game. Howerver the achievements in this game are awful. You get all except the last one done by just playing the game. No challenge at all. The last achievment is just stupid. It´s an endless grind for silver. Some people said they spent double the time it took to complete the game just to get the last achievement done. Unless they change that achievment I would not recommend this game.","February 14","false","37.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The art, maps, units, upgrade path are all fun at first. There's an interesting mechanic of gems and money to upgrade towers during a mission, but also upgrade towers, weapons and your base after a mission. It has what most tower defense games don't, which is a bit of a story.\n\nHowever, after about a dozen missions you get stuck on levels that can only be overcome by grinding back on earlier levels to get coins to upgrade your stuff. Not a little bit of grinding, like 10 hours of grinding for each new level. For example, grinding a level perfectly can give you 20 coins or so (it's random, so a range from 15-30) and that can take 10-20 minutes. It can take 300 coins to upgrade a particular path. There's about 40 different paths for each weapon type, tower type, etc. You may have to replay a mission 15 times to upgrade something all the way. That's almost 4 hours for just one path. Multiply that times 40 and it's over 150 hours of grinding. This is not fun.\n\nI'm not sure why the designers did it this way. It seems like they originally had a super evil plan to sell upgrades and then their conscious got to them and they stopped the microtransactions. Thanks for this as it would be terrible to have to buy this stuff. But as a result they didn't adjust game play.\n\nI would not recommend buying this unless it was 25 cents or something.","September 20, 2015","false","23.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Aesthetics look nice and sounds are fine enough, but after failing stage after stage without consulting guides, I feel that the game was really not worth it.
