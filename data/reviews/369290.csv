In AM:WE you take on the role of an air traffic controller at one of eight airports from across the world including London and Las Vegas. Your job is to control any aircraft in the sky or on the ground at the airport and make sure they safely arrive or depart while moving as quickly as possible to avoid delays for passengers.\n\n+Nice simple graphics which suit the game well\n+Eight very different airports, they all have very different layouts which makes each one unique\n+Four different game modes: Building Traffic (starts off slow but traffic increases as you play), Time Trial (move as many planes as possible in ten minutes), Move 100 Airplanes and Continuous Play (goes on forever, three different difficulty levels to try)\n+Very simple controls, just click on an aircraft and select what you want it to do\n+Simple but addictive gameplay, just control the planes to get them safely around the airport\n+In Continuous Play occasionally runways will close for repairs or flight restrictions will be imposed which makes the game more challenging\n+The different aircraft all have different speeds and stopping distances which needs to be taken into consideration when controlling your aircraft, adds a nice layer of difficulty to the game\n+Sound effects are good apart from the lack of a touchdown sound\n+There's a useful little mini-map which displays incoming and outgoing aircraft\n+Fullscreen has now been added in an update\n\n-The game still has no resolution options so the window stretches to fit your screen\n-Only five different types of aircraft, personally I would like to have seen at least two or three more for some more variation in the game\n-For the addition of three airports I don't think having the Steam version Â£4 more expensive than the mobile version is particularly reasonable\n\nVerdict:\nWorth Purchasing (7.5/10)\n\nAM:WE is a nice, casual, airport strategy game with simple graphics, simple gameplay and a few different ways to play. If you have an interest in aviation and can look past the game's issues then I recommend picking this one up.\n\n***This review was written using a key provided by the Developer for review purposes***\n\nEl K.","May 29, 2015","true","7.9"," 87 of 99 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","87","99","3","29"

It rocked.  Thank God for "Fast Hack'em" is all I have to say.\n\nOne of the cool things about the game (and the Commodore-64 in general) was the speech.  It was pretty cool to hear air traffic controllers communicating with airplanes.\n\nLike everyone, sometimes I am somewhat nostalgia and I remember this game fondly and with a certain amount of yearning -- I didn't get to play "Kennedy Approach" for very long because soon I was off to college and was too busy drinking beer and eating pizza.\n\nThe speech on this game is really cool but it's only the beginning.  I've been wondering for a long time what a modern version of "Kennedy Approach" would like and sound like and why one didn't exist.  This game is incredibly fun, addictive, and is a worthy successor.\n\nYou are an air traffic controller and your job is to guide planes to land (on which runway) and take-off.  Part traffic cop -- you have to direct planes to cross landing strips and to the gates.\n\nThe graphics are great -- top-down, static except for the planes flying around.  Oh and when the planes fly into each other there's a neato explosion.\n\nVariety?  Sure, there are about a dozen airports to choose from.  I like Anchorage -- I have no idea how well the game's layout mirrors the actual airport.  But you can imagine that each airport has its own strengths and challenges that would make no two games the same.\n\nEasy to learn, difficult to master, the easy mode is what you need to learn the ropes -- tell planes to slow down or speed up; direct them to different runways.  Manage your time and space well and your efficienty rating goes up.   Be flexible in your approach with a general plan of landing but understand when you either have too many planes landing or taking off that can't be accommodated by your general plan.  Timing can be everything -- real estate is expensive and so runways overlap and criss-cross.  One mistimed step and two planes are landing on top of each other, or are crossing the runways at inopportune times.\n\nTruly, this is a great game and deserves some of your time and money.  Well worth the $10, absolutely, and sure to loom large in peoples' minds as a great simulator!","January 30","true","1.0"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","21","22","2","0"

It's also a fun and compulsive game (you've been warned)!  It's not even trying to be a simulator, but instead more of a lightweight time-filler for when you're done playing your big, serious games.  You take control of departures and arrivals with the sole purpose of keeping everything moving without colliding using simple point and click.  There are four modes you can play, like handling 100 planes, time-trials or seeing how much of a score you can build as traffic becomes heavier and heavier, and there are eight international airports where runway positioning changes the challenge.  As soon as aircraft collide, it's game over (it's no good hoping no-one noticed that explosion on runway 25L) and as traffic builds, you're really striving for score, efficiency and time limits rather than acting the serious role of an ATC.  I like it for that.  I have ATC simulators already.  I didn't have a fun, lightweight version.\n\nThe graphics are simple but do the job well and the interface is clean and intuitive (with optional keyboard input for anyone who prefers not to use a mouse).  The developer is still adding new touches (wide-screen support has now been added and another airport is being added to the already feature-complete game).  Overall, I'm finding it happily addictive in that "just one more go" way.  In fact, I'm already racking up an alarming number of hours into a game that I figured I'd just spend a few amusing minutes with here and there (36 hours to date - maybe I need help)...  If you're looking for a time-filler game, then this fits that niche very nicely indeed.  Just don't buy it expecting ATC2/ATC3 or Global ATC - it's not even trying to be any of these games.  If you think of it as a fun time-management game, you're much closer to the mark (note that the developers, BigFatSimulations, also offer more serious-style ATC games direct from their website).\n\nGreat fun, and highly recommended!","May 31, 2015","true","95.0"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","16","16","0","9"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BirdCute/recommended/369290/","BirdCute","BirdCute","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BirdCute/","1507 products in account","Airport Madness: World Edition is an airport simulation game made by Big Fat Simulations. It is a very simple and enjoyable game with slight lack of content.\nIf this review is too long for you, I suggest you to only read the first paragraph about the game's content and the final verdict at the end.\n\nWhat is happening in the game:You have to control the airport and all the planes in a way that doesn't end with a crash. At least not for some time. By clicking on airplanes, you can manage when and where they take off, when do landed planes cross the roadway ...\n\nPros:    I gotta say, this game is addictive. It's really simple, but that is sometimes just the right way to succeed. When I lose, I always want to test myself if I can avoid the mistake I did the last time I played.\nThere are 9 maps in the game, which should be more than enough for your daily gaming needs. They are all based on the same concept, but the roadways are placed differently and, surprisingly, that requires the player to change the way he plays a bit. It's pretty unexpected but, to be honest, very pleasant.\nThere are a few game modes. Apart from the normal one, you also get Time Trial and Continuous Play (in case you don't want those damn plane crashes to end your career as an airport manager).\nThere are also leaderboards in this game. Sadly, they didn't implement it into Steam, so you'll encounter one of those old "Enter your name to enter your high score" messages.\nThis game is supposedly made by real air traffic controllers. If this is correct, kudos to the developer for thinking of that. It feels good to know that what you're playing is at least close to the real deal.\nI like the music. It's one of those looped generic simulator songs, but it sounds good and it really fits the whole game.\nAchievements, Trading Cards and MacOS support.\nCons:    The instructions menu doesn't make any damn sense. I have to figure the game out myself, it's just too long and complicated.\nThe settings menu is not really this game's best feature. No resolution options, only fullscreen on/off, the same goes with sounds.\nLet's be honest, the game doesn't look good, it looks like an online flash game. Not really that bothering, though.\nFor some reason, the achievements didn't work. I finally got one of them when I reinstalled the game.\nThe final verdict:Despite its tacky and old look, this game really drags you into its gameplay, which is fun and should keep you interested for a few hours. Four game modes and nine maps compensate for all the bad things and the (occasional) lack of variety.\nI enjoyed it a great deal and I ceratainly expect to play it some more in the future.\nThere will be a link to a free version under Further reading. Try it and, if you like it, I would really recommend you to buy it.\n\nFurther reading:    Store page\nFree version on Facebook, if you're into that\nGameplay trailer\nGreetings,\nBirdCute\n\nNote that my copy of this game was obtained for free for reviewing purposes. However, this did not affect the quality and objectivity of this review.\n---\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","August 5, 2015","true","5.7"," 33 of 47 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","33","47","0","1"

Difficulty ranges from slow and easy to fast and hectic.\n\nFor years I've been waiting for the successor to MicroProse's "Kennedy Approach", released back in 1985.  As far as gameplay goes, this comes close, but you don't have to direct outgoing planes to their destinations, weather is always perfect [edit: patchy clouds added 6/26/15] and you don't stack planes in holding patterns, but you get more control over them on the ground and have to manage who's crossing what runway and when as they taxi back to the terminal.  Also, there are different types of planes with different speeds to manage.\n\nAs of 5/28/15 there are 8 different airports to play, and the developers claim that they'll be adding more as time goes on. [edit: A ninth airport was added 6/26/15]\n\nThis is NOT a simulator, and you'd probably be disappointed if you were looking for one.  But if you're looking for a game where you have to manage chaos without a large learning curve, this is a good one for under ten US dollars.","May 28, 2015","true","54.2"," 21 of 29 people (72%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","72","21","29","2","6"

I waited until it was on offer and got it, though there was still a nagging doubt that even that was too much.\n\nAirport Madness is pretty much how I remember it- simple but nice enough graphics, simple but functional controls, and all round a decent casual game. What I would have liked is HD graphics and more maps, though there do seem to be more maps coming.\n\nAgain, Airport Madness is a decent game.

You can't change the keyboard keymap.

It was odd that this version took out the ability to set the traffic level from 1(lowest) to 10(holy crap! Mid-air traffic jams). The only way to set the traffic is in endless mode and even then you only have 3 options. I'd really like to see an update where there is a custom game setting. A option where you pick an airport, set how many planes you want to sucsessfuly land, set the traffic volume and set how many crashes you're allowed before a game over. That's what was missing in this game. I also would not mind if the maps were a little bit larger because it does get a tad crowded, I know that's the point, however, I'd really like more room for delaying flights. So, would I buy this game again? Well, I thought it over and then notived I'd already played it for 85 minutes in one sitting. After realizing that, yes I would buy it again. It's fun and fast paced. The feel and look of the game is great. It goes for the kind of style that is the most fun to the player rather than a realistic radar using controller. I like that because the game would be dull if it was realistic. It's a great little game, but, it is a bit pricey. I waited for the game to be 25% off and that made it worth my money (or lack there-of). I wont give the game a numerical rating since I don't think I could properly explain it. However, I would buy it again even as it is right now. But, I really home Bigfatsimulations considers my ideas.","August 8, 2015","true","7.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Fail in this task, and you get to see physics in action as two planes attempt to occupy the same space simultaneously.\n\nA simple but addictive task then, which is helped by the welcome inclusion of ATC background radio chatter to really get you in the mood. The maps are suitably varied, ranging from a single runway in China to the interlocking 4 way chaos of Amsterdam or Las Vegas.\n\nHowever, it should be said that there is little on offer beyond this. 4 game modes and an achievement system add only variation around the same theme. Occasional random events (closed runways) add to the challenge, but absent are the emergency landings, space shuttles and weather/daylight systems of other entries. The UI is straightfoward, which makes the gameplay enjoyable but the menus feel sparse.\n\nTo conclude then, AM:WE doesn't offer the world, but what it does have is an easy to use, entertaining and enjoyable premise. Give it a go then, but perhaps wait for a sale first.","April 21","true","6.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Pretty good.\n\nThis is probably the preemminent version of airport madness. This is essentially an fairly unrealstic air traffic control puzzle game where you are supposed to try to keep the airplanes at the various runways from running into each other and having accidents as each airport becomes progressively more and more busy until wrecks become inevitable. There are several airports to choose from, the sound effects are increadibly realistic and the music isn't too bad though often repetitive enough that you may wish to turn it off after a while (which you can easily do). This is a fun little puzzle game which gives you a lot for its relatively cheap price although you should probably endeavor to buy this when it is on a special Steam Sale for even more bang for your buck.","February 6","true","1.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Really? Do you really think so? If you had to actually sit down and write those words, then you aren't thinking very clearly. For the rest of you, no, this game will not give you an ATC simulation. I used to be an Air Traffic Controller and no, this game is nothing like the real thing. Then again, it's not supposed to be exactly like the real deal. This game was developed to be used on mobile phones, and it's pretty fun too. Basically, it's a timing game. Don't worry about breaking separation, the game doesn't recognize separation. Don't worry about radar ops, there is no radar. You control three things: Sending the plane to and from the hangar, landing the plane, and giving the take off command. You don't deal with final, arrival, departure, none of it. You can control the speed of the plane in small intervals, and yes, that will become pretty important if you're going for the achievements, but that's about it really.\n\nI have sat down and beat this game in its entirety and I actually enjoyed it. It's not a stressful game, and it's not really a "super fun" game either, but it's a great time waster, and it's pretty easy to 100% if you sit down and go for it. It goes on sale from time to time, so if you don't want to pay $10 for it, just wait for it to go back on sale. I do recommend it. There are other games out there that give you an accurate ATC simulation, so if that's what you're looking for, avoid this game. For the rest of you, have fun!","January 5","true","12.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Just when you think you've got everything running smoothly, some small plane you didn't even noticed lands on the runway where you've got a long line of jets crossing, and it's game over.\n\nAs some negative reviews have pointed out, this is not anywhere near being a full-blown Air Traffic Control simulator. But that's like arguing that Rock Band sucked because it didn't use real instruments. There's room for more casual, simplified simulations that communicates the frenetic pace of ATC at major airports.","September 26, 2015","true","17.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I must say this was a fun game, perhaps more than the others, because you can see the airport evolve over time and that game this a different SIM perspective.  However, it would be even better to be able to have more control of the airport build out like other airport sim games but with the more simple tools within this game.  This is a fun game and though I have not played it much it is a game that I will surely return to time and again.  My kids also like it.  Price is right too.  Cheaper than a movie.  :)","May 28","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
