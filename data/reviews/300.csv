Rook was shadowing him, double checking each spot that Johannson had checked before.  I was in the middle with Peters, helping him carry the M2 Browning.  And Stewart was in the rear, covering our backs with his Thompson at the ready.\n\nIt was quiet.  Too quiet.\n\nThe bridge we had set out to capture was undefended, and we quickly set up a defensive position in case a German patrol stumbled upon us.\n\nThe sound started as a low rumble.  We looked around, at each other, confused as to why the ground was shaking.  It got louder, and we could soon hear the sound of people yelling.  We readied our weapons, getting ready for the enemy to throw a grenade or fire a Panzerschreck.\n\nBut nothing could prepare us for what happened next.\n\nA giant tide of German soldiers, all carrying trench shovels and primed Steilhandgranates in their hands, came around the corner, rushing at us screaming at the top of their lungs.\n\nWe opened fire, but there were too many and we were quickly overrun.\n\nStewart was the first to go, having gotten overzealous with his Thompson.  He had managed to push the wave of Germans back, when they surrounded him and began pummeling him to death with their shovels.\n\nOne of them, holding a grenade, charged Rook and Johannson from behind.  They never saw it coming.\n\nBy now, it was only me and Peters, him firing his MG wildly at the advancing tide while I threw frag grenade after frag grenade.  And then Peters started to run out of ammo.\n\nQuickly, I rushed up to his position with a new box of ammunition, but by that time they were almost upon him.  Peters quickly pulled out his M1911 and managed to squeeze off a few shots, but it wasn't long before he too was buried under the mass of grey and black.\n\nI was cornered, back against a locked door while I blasted soldier after soldier back with my Sniper rifle.  But it was no use.  They descended upon me, swinging shovels indiscriminately at my already bruised and battered body.  They were relentless, beating me until at last, I succumbed to the darkness.\n\nAs my vision blurred, they stopped screaming long enough for one of them to say something to me.\n\nSomething that would shock me to the core.\n\nHe said:\n\n"lol noob get rushed fggt"","December 15, 2014","true","4.1"," 806 of 847 people (95%) found this review helpful 950 people found this review funny","95","806","847","950","22"

Old age hasn’t killed DOD:S.\n\nIf anything age has worked in DOD:S’s favor. For example, it attracts an older and more mature crowd. I haven’t had to put up with as much drama or slurs from annoying prepubescent teammates as I do in more modern multiplayer shooters.\n\nAnother example of age helping the DOD:S experience is how “old school” it feels. Despite the WW2 setting, DOD:S plays more like an arena shooter from the 1990s than today’s super serious military shooters. Forget aiming down iron sights. Secondary fire for most weapons throws solid punch instead. Expect to spend a lot of time zipping about, shooting dudes with crosshairs, punching them for good measure, and laughing at the exaggerated ragdoll physics.\n\nDay of Defeat: Source is not a masterpiece but it’s worth a look if you have a hankering for a shooter that isn’t too serious.\n","November 26, 2014","true","20.4"," 152 of 157 people (97%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","97","152","157","11","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BavarianGod/recommended/300/","BavarianGod","[AReV]BavarianGod","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BavarianGod/","3478 products in account","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbxSkoEqr7g\n\nBefore the zeitgeist of perks, leveling and killstreaks consumed the multiplayer shooter market, Valve released an updated version of a successful team based World War 2 Half Life mod on their brand new engine and dubbed it Day of Defeat Source. Released in 2005, Day of Defeat was rooted in another industry fad—the world war 2 shooter. In the same year, Medal of Honor European Assault, Call of Duty 2, Brothers in Arms Road to Hill 30 and it's sequel Earned in Blood were all released. While the former games were largely single player story driven affairs, Day of Defeat Source was strictly a team based multiplayer game that distinguished itself by being extraordinarily balanced and offering phenomenal map design.\n\nPlayers can enlist with either the U.S. Army or the German Wehrmacht and skirmish over capture points or attempt to arm bombs on strategic assets. Each side has six classes that utilize historic weaponry and almost every weapon sets itself apart from the opposite side's equivalent in some way. While the German's Mauser K98 is a single shot bolt action weapon that fires slower than the clip fed semi automatic Garand that the U.S. Army's rifleman class uses, it's also more powerful. Similarly, the Mauser M712 side arm carried by the German Panzerfaust units chews through enemies at close range but the M1 Carbine used by U.S. Rocket troops is far more versatile being semi automatic and highly effective at medium range. With these differences, players often built an allegiance to one army versus another based on their weapon preferences.\n\nEach class also featured a set of quirks that required a bit of practice to master. Machine gunners couldn't effectively kill an enemy unless their gun was mounted, the recoil on these weapons is violent enough to have players staring at the sky box after pulling the trigger. This means that machine gunners are largely a defensive class along with snipers who are hopeless in mid range combat. The assault class utilizes early assault rifles which suffer from heavy recoil and are most effective when fired from a crouched position. Newcomers often favor the support class since their sub machine guns allow the kind of fast moving spray and pray tactics that modern shooter fans are accustomed to but the power and accuracy of rifle troops makes them easy prey at medium to long range where their automatic weapons are almost impotent. While it may be tempting to walk around with a rocket launcher, attempting to aim while moving is incredibly slow making players huge targets. These major differences in the play styles between classes make the experience rewarding and, in some cases, polarizing.\n\nThe six official maps offered with the game prove to be masterclasses of map design. In addition to the main lanes that take players to each objective, there are side routes that allow players to flank opponents and remove pesky snipers and machine gunners. Maps that are won by capturing all the territories feature a central capture point that requires at least two teammates to capture meaning it's impossible to go lone wolf and win a game. Uncoordinated teams will often find themselves entrenched in a bitter stalemate over these points—especially on Flash which is the most linear map of the bunch. Coordinating your teams efforts and making a big push toward an objective on multiple fronts often yields victory. It's a far cry from the lack of teamwork required by many modern shooter games. While six maps is a bit disappointing the community has stepped in to pad the play-list with hundreds of custom maps.\n\nValve has continued to support Day of Defeat Source over the years, updating the game to include achievements and trading cards. It's mechanics are almost unrivaled almost a decade after release, in spite of the fact that the popularity of first person shooters has never abated. The aging visuals do little to hamper the thrill of rushing capture points and there are few things more satisfying than putting a bullet in an opponent's head while on the move with a K98. It's a shame that more shooters don't require the skill and cooperation demanded by Day of Defeat Source.","May 6, 2014","true","9.9"," 190 of 209 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","190","209","0","10"

I'm not aware at all of how the original Day of Defeat fared, as I never played it, therefore I can't make a proper comparison between the two.\n\nWhat I can talk about though, is obviously Day of Defeat: Source, having played it quite a bit and having fun with it. The game is set in WW2, and while a lot of games are set in WW2, nowadays with the massive trend of current and near future FPSes lately, it is remarkably a refreshing change.\n\nSource obviously made the maps and models look much better than the original game. They still hold up quite well nowadays, much like Source itself in any case, so for most people there won't be much of a problem when it comes to graphical fidelity.\n\nWhile I don't know how the gameplay in the original DoD was like, if it was anything like CS 1.6 to CS: Source, it may have ruffled a few feathers on the original DoD community upon DoD: Source's release. Or maybe it didn't, because of the gameplay.\n\nThe gameplay is most definitely this game's strong point by a long shot. There are several classes to pick from, varied enough to justify their presence in the game, and fully suit the setting, just like the various weapons you have. The shooting feels good, just like most of the FPSes in Source.\n\nUnfortunately, it suffers from not having a whole lot of variety to it, both in game modes and in maps. And by now, there are naturally also other FPSes set in WW2 that feel and play a lot better than DoD: Source. There's still a community present, so you should have no difficulties jumping into a multiplayer game however.\n\nI would get this game. It's cheap and can be an enjoyable and refreshing game experience once in a while. Plus it's a Valve game, and those come with a lot of obvious perks. (Garry's Mod models being an example) Just don't expect too much out of it.","November 27, 2013","true","15.0"," 75 of 86 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","75","86","0","0"

Valve doesn't do a lot with it anymore, but it still holds up greatly if you are looking for a blast to the past. The graphics and combat are so good that some newer games that are made in this day and age lack mechanics this game has. A classic WWII deathmatch game that contains 6 fun classes that are available to play on the U.S. Team or the german Werhmacht Team. This game's graphics are very nice and easy on the eyes, the gameplay is smooth and quick to learn and play, the ambience and the deaths, (not to mention the combat) are fantastic and nostalgic.\nThere are multiple gamemodes to choose from such as capturing flags or blowing up a control point.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/prowbar/recommended/300/","prowbar","Prowbar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/prowbar/","52 products in account","If you are a WW2 fan or you love hardcore shooters, this game is for you. Its a way different approach than say, Counter Strike. (You can't compare them and that's not what i'm going to do)\n\nYou have 1 gamemode, it involves around capturing flags. There are two teams, the Americans are Germans. Both teams are treated equally (which is awesome, its not like the americans are the good guys and the nazis stupid germans that scream like a girl) and have six classes each with their own sets of weapons. Each class has a ranged attack, melee and explosives (grenades). Most of the classes get a backup pistol with them.\nThe classes are: (German equipment first, the American and then what they share)\n- Rifleman (Mauser Kar89k, M1 Garand and rifle grenades) Has the ability to use ironsights and focuses on long-range combat.\n- Assault (MP40 and M1A1 Thompson, a smoke grenade and a frag grenade) For CQB.\n- Support (STG-44/MP-44 and B.A.R, 2 frag grenades) For mid and close range and surpressive fire.\n- Sniper (Kar98K Scoped and the M1903 Springfield Scoped). No grenades. For long range and to take out classes like other snipers and machinegunners.\n- Machinegunner (MG-42 and Browning M1919A4 (I think)) No grenades. Anti sniper, anti machinegunner and to take out large groups of enemies. Must be deployed using the bipod to shoot accurately. (hipfire not advised lol)\n- Rocket (not the rocket itself, the class) Uses a Panzershreck and M1 Bazooka. As a secondary you get the Mauser C96 or M1 Carbine (my fav). Anti Sniper and machinegunner.\n\nThe classes all have the same health and speed. You die fast (in 1-3 shots, always 1 shot headshot) and rushing is not advised. The game is extremely faced paced and competitive. You need to work together as a team, use your microphone or voice commands to communicate. The voice commands are awesome and well voiced.\nBesides that you have the option to go prone (using Z as default I think) This greatly reduced recoil and makes you harder to hit. The disadvantage of it is that when to go prone or out of prone you holster your weapon for 1-2 seconds. I've died many times of this. You get used to it after a while, though. Another option is to sprint. There is a stamina bar that lets you sprint for a few seconds. You cannot shoot while sprinting. In the realism modes, when you get shot in your arm, you drop your primary weapon. A pretty neat feature, but annoying at the same time.\n\nThe gunplay itself it pretty well done, it has the same feature as Counter Strike when you are standing still, you accuracy with the most guns is near perfect and when you are moving your accuracy decreases. Almost all the guns have massive recoil, and I mean massive, it takes a lot of skill to master.\n\nThe base game comes with a lot of maps and many custom maps too which I don't care about. The stock maps are good and have cool shortcuts and offer a lot of replay value.\n\nThere is no singleplayer unless you download a bot mod, which I haven't tried. There are plenty of multiplayer servers to choose from.\n\nThe servers mostly consist of 32 player slots, which means 16 vs 16 players.\n\nFor active servers DON'T use the serverbrowser, its broken, use Gametracker to locate servers instead. The EdgeGamers servers are pretty good, their clan is EgO (I think). These servers have all the realism settings turned off and have a medic mod that lets you call a medic by typing !medic in the chat. I advise binding this to a key. The medic only heals when your health is below 25 HP (that is when the healthbar turns red). Ping isn't a problem really, but above 150 ping the game becomes unplayable (no ♥♥♥♥ sherlock)\nThere are a lot of realism servers too, but its your choice on what to play.\n\nCommunity is awesome and mostly mature players. There are daily around 900-1100 players online across all regions.\n\nThe game runs almost on every system, I have no problems with it really, and I have a low end PC.\n\nWhat I hate about Day of Defeat is the constant explosive spam. Grenades deal massive damage and get spammed mostly in doorways and passages. You have the option to throw the grenades back, but this is hard to do. Best to counter the spam is to flank the enemy.\n\nDo I recommend it? Heck yes!\n\nTL:DR: great game I advise you buy it, its worth the full price or wait for steam sale and buy the Valve multiplayer pack. Same price and comes with CSS. (For Gmod textures lol)","December 16, 2015","true","59.3"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","16","19","0","0"

Remember when you were only five years old, and you wanted to fight in the army like your pa or grandpa? Well, this game is a bit far back, but you are a soldier fighting in World War 2 in this game! You can choose between being a Nazi or a U.S. soldier in the team selection, and you can pick from six different classes.\n\nYou can play as the rifleman, a class armed with the standard rifle of the faction as well as a long range grenade launcher. You can also play as assault, a class that carries a submachine gun as well as a smoke grenade to lay down smoke. You can play as a support, a class sporting a heavy automatic rifle to lay down cover. You can play as a sniper... need an explanation for this? You can play as a machine gunner, armed with a really big gun that can be deployed and mow down a huge group of enemies. Finally, you can be a rocketeer, a class armed with an anti-armor weapon of the faction (rocket launcher) as well as a unique sidearm weapon.\n\nThere are two game modes. One is territorial control where you fight over flags you have to capture. The other is a detonation game mode where you have to plant explosives at certain areas of the enemy team.\n\nOne problem you may have with this game is the fact that the community is very good because it consists of many people that've played the game for long, so you may find it difficult in that regard. The community is relatively friendly, though. Some servers are very hostile towards profane language, and they ban for some stupid reasons, but there are still good servers out there.\n\nIt's just ten dollars.

Then there are the arrogant pros, who will tell you how stupid you are, just because they are better than you. And they will even tell you how badly you play after you have achieved their skill. Then there is this one drunk individual who will join servers randomly and just say unidentifiable stuff all the time. Then there are some neonazis, a lot of nonworkers and drinkers. Then there are people who pretend to be a girl for whatever reason.\n\nIf you find one of the few normal players, who is not 40 years old and still plays this game, you are lucky and deserve a cookie!\n\nAnd then there's me - an outstanding player who is just bored so he knocks down some idiots.

Released on Sept 26, 2005 this was a great alternative to CS:S. Which I played for many years before DOD:S. This game had something different to offer than other fps games at the time. You picked classes and also allowed you to respawn, which offered continuous gameplay.\n\nIn it's hay day this game was a blast, especially for competitive league players. However this game has lost it's magic and has died. I have played this game for many many years and have 2 accounts with a combined total of 2,763 hours, I have played in many different competitive leagues, on different teams and also had my own team at one point.\n\nOut of all the fps games I've ever played (since Wolfenstein 3D, 1992) this game I have always felt discriminated against for being legitimately good. Over 75 public server perma bans, hence the 2nd account.\nI am not trying to gloat or brag, this is a big issue for almost every league player. Unit and clan public server admins would pretty much just ban me without notice or call me hacker/cheater than perma ban me. I would even use my 2nd account with another name and had to actually hold myself back due to threat of being banned... I just always felt this saltyness from certain servers.\n\nI have in the past uninstalled this game, due to lack of server, player and league quality.\n\nIf you want to purchase an FPS game look elsewhere, this game is outdated and it's hard to find a good server to play on without mods.\n\nPlus the assault is overused and probably one the worst F$%KING weapons made by an actual human being and agreed upon to be released in a game.","January 14, 2014","false","528.9"," 32 of 57 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","32","57","2","5"

The gameplay remains much the same, but is a little faster paced and with a smaller selection of classes and weapons. That said, DOD:S is great fun to play, provided you can find a reliable server. Unfortunately, most of the game's community has moved on to other games, leaving only a small subset of players behind. In terms of gameplay, the maps are well designed and the weapons are varied but balanced. The game has aged, but still looks acceptable.

You'll need coordination, knowledge of when and how to push areas, and decent gun handling skills. Features like the recoil, various types of movement, and the aesthetics make for an immersive and fun experience. The technology may have dated a bit, but it's by no means broken or buggy. If anything, any choppiness of your animations and actions help further the concept of immersion, unlike the butter-smooth shooting of today. It's a rough, hard world out there, and it's up to your squad to set things right.","December 21, 2015","true","13.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SammyFuzz/recommended/300/","SammyFuzz","Fuzz ☯","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SammyFuzz/","127 products in account","My gaming life has revolved around Day of Defeat after my fascination with Half-Life, the mods that came of it, and my family. My brother John (Fuzz) (I use his pseudonym because I look up to my brother and the name is catchy to me) and a few programmers at the time came up with the initial concept of DoD after my brother watched Saving Private Ryan. At an early age (8 or 9) I would watch my brother create sandbox levels within his newly created mod, Day of Defeat. My brother paved the way for Day of Defeat before his departure of the development team (focus on school and relationships) shortly before Valve purchased the mod and turned it into a Valve product.\n\nSoon after my father (Wes) (Fuzzdad) would join in on the efforts to help propel the game forward with level design. My father was a Major in the Army and a helicopter pilot for 13 years, to say he loves history is an understatement. His dedication to the game and meticulous craftsmanship of design with each level was researched, designed, tested, redesigned and re-tested for countless hours. I vividly remember walking downstairs on more than one occasion to his mancave and watching him design what is now known as dod_glider with the Hammer tool, Valve Software's map creation program for their game engine. I am grateful that my father allowed me to playtest his maps and give input. Fuzzdad went on to be a Valve-contracted level designer for dod_glider, dod_flugplatz and dod_falaise. He also created custom maps such as dod_factory and dod_Anvil (Made on Source)\n\nFuzzdad worked directly with Matt Boone (Main Programmer for DoD/DoD:s and now works on multiple Valve games, also known as Mugsy) with game changes, community map pack releases, updates to stock maps, texture files, sounds, etc. I commend Mugsy for sticking it out as long as he did with DoD/DoD:S by helping the community and working with my father to better the game.\n\nDay of Defeat and Day of Defeat: Source are my favorite multiplayer FPS. It is evident Valve gave up on Day of Defeat: Source after Sourcefilms was tested with DoD:S (The trailers referring to specific maps like Donner) It's hard to blame Valve for lack of content or continuous updates with the game not breaking even on sales. The WW2 era FPS from the 90s and early 2000's has lost the populace favor but that doesn't mean this game is anything less than great.\n\nDo I recommend this game? Yes, yes and yes. DoD:S is a majestic game that has countless replay value and at its core is fun. It's realistic in terms of 1-2 bullet kills. While there is only one "true" gamemode (CTF) they also have demolition style maps, but the majority of what's left of public servers play CTF or realism. I personally wish they would release a steam workshop for the game or add gamemodes, but it would be safe to say DoD:S has lost it's prime motivation that it once had years ago. What's left of public servers is mostly realism units which you may or may not like (I personally find them more like a person trying to relive his/her military past and not fun in terms of gameplay) but you as a player might find that style of play different or fun.\n\nTo conclude: Day of Defeat will always be a part of me and my future endeavours in gaming and I hope you the reader give this game a try, even if it's not in its prime anymore. It's still enjoyable to pub once in a while.\n\nI'll always have hope for a new DoD, maybe one day, maybe never, but I'll always have my memories of this great game.","November 27, 2010","true","225.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Capture the flag is a great style of game to play, and there are also a few maps that involve detonation. While Valve hasn't released a ton of maps, there are enough community made maps to keep the game fresh for a long time. For people that don't enjoy having to wait to respawn in a game like CS, DoD:S offers the ability to respawn right after death, making the game faster paced and (in my opinion) a lot more fun.

Being the procrastinating and absent minded little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that I was, I forgot to prepare a dish until the morning it was due.\n\nI hastily scrambled some eggs with pepper and salsa and preteneded that it was Mexican food. Of course no one wanted any and I can't blame them, so I packed up my eggs and put them in my backpack. While my pals and I were horsing around someone fell on my backpack and the eggs splattered over the inside, but I didn't really care because I was about to go home anyway.\n\nThat was the last day of school before our Easter vacation which lasted about a week. I neglected to clean up the egg abomination in my backpack, and so it sat the duration of my time off from school. By some miracle I didn't notice the smell until I was at school again, and the smell sent me into a dry-heaving spasm. People around me started saying, "What's that smell?". I quickly stuffed the egg-ridden backpack into my locker and ran off to class. Due to some possible divine intervention no one figured out that I was the cuplrit.","August 9, 2013","true","0.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

You play as either an Allied or Axis soldier and work with others on your team to accomplish specific goals, such as capturing objectives or capturing key locations. There are several classes to choose from, so everyone can hopefully find one they excel with.\n\nVisually, the game is (kinda/sorta) beautiful even these days, and the game's vibrant aesthetic style lends itself well to the Source engine that powers it. The models are pretty detailed, yet far from perfect. Moreover, the lighting of the game is actually a factor when picking your shots at other players, because it makes effective use of HDR lighting. So the light and dark colors contrast seamlessly. The weapons are also rendered quite realistically, and sound as such.\n\nOverall, this is a nice game that while being older, still has a decent playerbase and is tremendous fun.

The game is really fun and because of the very long rounds (they can usually last an hour, and a lot of the times, even more), you get drawn into the game. You want to help your team become victorious. It really does make it seem like in you're in some war, and I sometimes feel guilty when I have to stop playing, because I'm "deserting" my side.\n\nNow, if you have played it before, or you are sure that you'll like the game, it is definitely worth it. But if you're not sure if you'll like it or not, I suggest waiting until it is on sale for under $5. I got the game when the Vallve Collection Pack was going for $25, and I don't regret it from all the "hidden gems" I got that I normally wouldn't buy.\n\nThe only disappointing thing is how there's a lack of a big community still in the game, but you'll always find a few highly dedicated servers with great people and features.\nBecause of all this, I give it a 9/10","March 19","true","18.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I've never played a fluid and fast-paced WW2 shooter such as this in my years of gaming. I started playing this in high school, and now I've graduated from college and am teaching abroad and I am STILL playing this game. I love it to death and I hope the community stays intact until the next DOD. For any newbies, this is a great time to start playing because the intensity has dwindled (unless of course you saunter your way into a Chinese server -- Good luck). Furthermore, a lot of older, self-defeated gentleman tackle this game whenever their wives and children are not vacumming their life force away. So please, play this game. It doesn't play "realistically", but it is extremely effluent and feels like a Grade-A WW2 shooter.","December 17, 2014","true","390.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is rewarding, and exciting, but you have to put the work in to get the most out of it. The community of DOD is the best I have come across, next to no squeakers, good server communities, and everyone seems to know eachother. However, what might explain this is that a large number of players have been shooting nazis since the original Half-Life mod, and are incredibly good at the game. This means that it does take a fair bit of playing to get anywhere near their level, especially if you are new to Source games. Map awareness plays a big part, so it is essential to know all of the regulars. DOD plays alot like counter strike, as there are (nearly) no scopes, and spray and pray is out of the question. It is a more tactical shooter than most FPS, but is definitley also not a realism shooter.\n\nVerdict: 7.5/10\n\nTL;DR good game, you have to put the work in to get max enjoyment out of it. great but skilled community. Tactical FPS.\n\n\n","December 3, 2014","true","15.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","3"

This game is one of the most well-made and well-polished FPS-game there is. It has silky-smooth animations, rock-solid gameplay mechanics and proper, realistic sound design. This game is what we call a no-boshiet experience. It is clean, well made and solid. If you are looking for a game that offers a proper solid FPS-experience set within a realistic setting and playing with serious yet helpful people, this is the game for you. But if you are looking for a game that has plenty of deep grinding/leveling-features with killstreaks and ballistic knifes, this game is far from anything you would enjoy. If you long back to the days of when online FPS-games were pure, solid and required skill, yet don't like that kick of nostalgia, then go for Day of Defeat: Source.","November 10, 2014","true","17.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's fun to play, the shooting is satisfying, and the graphics look surprisingly good. The art style is also very appealing. Valve did a very good job at balancing the two factions, mostly the rifleman class of both. The Germans have a Kar98k bolt action and the US have the garand. The Kar98 is mostly a one shot in the chest and the garand is a 1-2 shot kill but less accurate and it excells in close quarters. I would very much recommend picking this game up for the low price of $9.99.","December 10, 2013","true","75.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That being said i really enjoyed this and clocked 60+ hours.\n\nAs for the community of players that are still playing this game; not once did i play a game that had someone screaming or typing abuse to anyone on the server, People actually use their mics for tactical direction on this game rather than telling other players how poor they are etc, that being said, i may have just been lucky with the servers that i played on and the times of day.\n\nYou will need to work as a team if you have any hope of playing this game without becoming cannon fodder, If you are the type of player that likes to just run in and gun as soon as round starts then this game is going to frustrate you rather quickly as you rapidly build a negative kill to death ratio. So no grabbing an MG and running and gunning the map up, your team will rely on the covering fire so that they can move up without getting slaughtered, especially seeing as most servers limit the number of a class that can be used by one team, people may get a bit miffed if you have the only mg class and you are actively trying to take flags rather that give covering fire.\n\nI defiantely recommend this game to people if they enjoy online multiplayer and and a ww2 period setting.","March 22, 2015","true","63.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you want to be the victor, you need to grab your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ rifle, run to cover, crouch to take steady aim, and use your ironscope like it was the fist of the north star, shoot dem piercing bullets through your enemy, pull out your nade, yell PANZERSCHRECK!!!!!! at the top of your lungs, throw it, THEN LOOK DEATH IN THE EYES, and tell it TO GO ♥♥♥♥ ITSELF. In this game, it's Axis vs Wermacht. You can be 'MURRIKA, (♥♥♥♥ YEAH) or HITLER'S PERSONAL ARMY. You also get 6 classes to choose upon. 6 CLASSES. I TOLD YOU THIS GAME WAS HARDCORE. Make sure you are near a hospital because YOUR HEART MAY NOT TAKE IT.","December 10, 2012","true","123.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is rewarding, and exciting, but you have to put the work in to get the most out of it. The community of DOD is the best I have come across, next to no squeakers, good server communities, and everyone seems to know eachother. However, what might explain this is that a large number of players have been shooting nazis since the original Half-Life mod, and are incredibly good at the game. This means that it does take a fair bit of playing to get anywhere near their level, especially if you are new to Source games. Map awareness plays a big part, so it is essential to know all of the regulars. DOD plays alot like counter strike, as there are (nearly) no scopes, and spray and pray is out of the question. It is a more tactical shooter than most FPS, but is definitley also not a realism shooter.\n\nVerdict: 7.5/10\n\nTL;DR good game, you have to put the work in to get max enjoyment out of it. great but skilled community. Tactical FPS.\n\n\n","December 3, 2014","true","15.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","3"

Day of Defeat:Souce not only has all the fun of the original DoD, but it has become a timeless classic, pretty much like a Rolex or a good bottle of Chateau Lafite Rothschild.\n\nUnlike many newer and more modern FPS, DoD:Source has a loyal fanbase and it is easy to find an online match any time of the day, any day of the week. This is way more than can be said of games like Red Orchestra 2.\n\nForget about modern graphics: DoD:S is rustic, and takes no toll on even the more modest graphics cards. It runs well on old hardware and even IGPs. There are no visual bells and whistles, and I like it that way. The focus of the game is on playability, and once you're on a match, there is no leveling up, no buying weapons, etc. You pick your class and try your best to kill as many enemies as possible and not to get shot.\n\nI have enjoyed this game for several years, and as long as there are online servers out there, I'll be playing, no matter what new games are released.

Well I atleast hope you know about the WWII 1942 Times in Germany well this games relates to that time in war, it's a two team war game USA Army, and Wehrmacht, Wehrmacht are German Soldiers in WWII Times. Its TF2 Because how the gameplay and team war based of the game is, its like Counter Strike, because sorta same thing it's like CSS But DoD Aka Day of Defeat. DoD:S and CSS, I hope you know what im trying to say they have "Source" at the end of the names or the game and its like that hard to explain how its like CSS. I reccomend this game for ages 12+ on my opinion from how it is, yes I am 12 at the time 2014 but, does that really matter unless you are the parent reading this and does not like your young daughter or son playing games that have, Blood, Violence, and WWII 1942, because in real life 1942 WWII was bad times. I hope this review helped you parents, ladies and gentleman to know more about the game before buying it.","November 22, 2014","true","5.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

I love it to death and I hope the community stays intact until the next DOD.

Word of advice, do not use hax in this game regardless of how uber they are. Yeah I was at the top at one point getting 20 head shots per match, knowing exactly where to aim because I could look through walls, and laughing my butt off as enemies tried to evade me using smoke grenades. Once I got vac banned though it all went downhill from their. I was no longer allowed in 98% of the servers. People who once idealized me for being the king of head shots now spit in my face. And worst of all, I am the biggest noob when I'm not high off hax. Word of advice kids, do not do hax. I've been down that road before. Yeah it may seem glamerous being unbeatable but it will catch up to you. Do right! Play fair! Say no to hax.","July 25, 2014","true","4.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That being said i really enjoyed this and clocked 60+ hours.\n\nAs for the community of players that are still playing this game; not once did i play a game that had someone screaming or typing abuse to anyone on the server, People actually use their mics for tactical direction on this game rather than telling other players how poor they are etc, that being said, i may have just been lucky with the servers that i played on and the times of day.\n\nYou will need to work as a team if you have any hope of playing this game without becoming cannon fodder, If you are the type of player that likes to just run in and gun as soon as round starts then this game is going to frustrate you rather quickly as you rapidly build a negative kill to death ratio. So no grabbing an MG and running and gunning the map up, your team will rely on the covering fire so that they can move up without getting slaughtered, especially seeing as most servers limit the number of a class that can be used by one team, people may get a bit miffed if you have the only mg class and you are actively trying to take flags rather that give covering fire.\n\nI defiantely recommend this game to people if they enjoy online multiplayer and and a ww2 period setting.","March 22, 2015","true","63.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's fun to play, the shooting is satisfying, and the graphics look surprisingly good. The art style is also very appealing. Valve did a very good job at balancing the two factions, mostly the rifleman class of both. The Germans have a Kar98k bolt action and the US have the garand. The Kar98 is mostly a one shot in the chest and the garand is a 1-2 shot kill but less accurate and it excells in close quarters.

Pure, fast paced (but not too fast!) fun, maintaining the high pace/realism balance in a pleasant way. It is focused mostly on pushing the frontline from one team's base to another in order to take over the tactical points. To win, you don't really need the best aim or reflexes, you just need to be smart and think somewhat tactical. Constant spawns don't make you rage over every death, but rather keep on trying.

Some great voice commands to scream as your getting shot at/shoot at something.\n\nA few weak point thought. My main gripe is the melee. This is a game where you gotta SELECT the melee weapon. They include and are limited to a knife/knuckle duster contraption that your guy refuses to use to its full potential and just thumps enemies with it rather than using the seemingly VERY SHARP KNIFE PART, or the spade. Yep, a spade, why not? Geneva convention? Wuzzat?\n\nOh, or the best melee weapon; Your fists. But you can only use YOUR FISTS, if you have a smg. No no, ONLY IF YOU HAVE AN SMG. I really feel the melee lets this game down, and would be better with a designated melee button that attacks with whatever you got in your hand.\n\nOther than that, fun times.","September 27, 2012","true","9.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Some games are just made to do that, even if they have to wait for years to be discovered, and that's a quality worth praising. DOD Source will steadily, but securely, ascent to the title of 'veteran' and be worthy of hosting fabulous evenings with friends.

It's a lot slower-moving and less forgiving than a lot of modern FPS games, and it handles recoil pretty heavily - you can't W+M1 and expect to do well. You have to think about what you're doing and be pretty cautious. The community is kind of small, but weirdly they're the nicest, most courteous playerbase of any online game I've ever played. I feel like this is because most of them are mild-mannered suburban dads who like history. It also feels like most of them are pretty good, like they've been playing since the game came out.\n\nOverall, it's a fun game, and while there's nothing really wrong with it, there's nothing especially great about it either - you probably won't hate the experience, but there's not much to keep you coming back either. Still, you probably won't regret picking it up, even if you just get it so you can use the textures and files for Garry's Mod.

If not, grab that thing and hold onto it like someone’s trying to steal it. What are you doing still reading this? If you’ve never choked that turkey before, you’re missing out.\nPlace the shaft in your palm and fully wrap your hand right around the shaft using all fingers. Now go to town. If you’re circumcised, you might want to spit on it first. Saliva is the #1 most accessible and popular natural lube of all time, as voted by men since forever.\n\n\n\nhow to masturbate\n\nThe Backhander – Likely the last time you received a backhander, it was across the face from your father for being sassy.\nThis backhander is a lot more pleasant. Similar to the standard ‘Fist’, but instead of an underhand grip you have your palm on the top facing down with your thumb underneath the shaft. In other words, flip that fist and go to town. (note for newbies: not to actual town. Masturbating in public is generally frowned upon)\n\n\n\nhow to masturbate\n\nThe ‘OK’ –  Use only your index finger and thumb to wrap around the shaft forming a ring. Same action as The Fist but far less contact. A little less hands on for the more sensitive among us. You can use either the overhand or underhand position for this one. Be adventurous, mix it up.\n\n\n\nhow to masturbate\n\nThe Edward Scissorhands – No, Johnny Depp isn’t going to give you a hand with this one.\nMake a scissor shape with your index and middle finger (The same two fingers you use when some putz cuts you off in traffic) The palm of your hand should be facing your body. Now the middle finger goes underneath on the most sensitive area while the index finger gives traction.\nThis technique is also known as the Prince William, after PW was photographed holding his ♥♥♥♥♥ like this to ♥♥♥♥ at a polo match. Fancy!\n\n\n\nhow to masturbate\n\nThe Cigar –  Sometimes called The Hook.This one is a bit more tricky, but if you’re looking for variety give it a shot. Make a tight fist, but stick your index finger out in a hook shape and wrap that one around yourself. A variation on this is The Underhook, which will give more friction to the underside.\n\n\n\nYou know know the basic techniques of how to masturbate and we hope you’ve found something there to keep you occupied the next time your girlfriend leaves the house for 5 minutes to pop down to the store. More masturbation techniques to come, and as always, feel free to send us your favourites. And if you’d like to move up a level or two, learn how to masturbate with your balls HERE, and find the male G-Spot HERE.\n","January 31","true","20.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Alex is swift to follow. Towards us come a hail of bullets, and I clasp my sniper firmly in my hands. The Wehrmacht are capturing buildings to make sure their attack works. Not if we can help it. This building will remain ours. Jim picks up his SMG and aims it at the corners. Me and Alex follow behind him, as our weapons aren't suited for the close quarters. I have a sniper. He, a mount-machinegun.\n\nThe explosions outside are deafening, and the enemy fire has started again. In comes a fellow american soldier with his SMG. He runs ahead of Jim in a hurry. I don't know why. He enters the next room swiftly. We hear gunfire. Then we see him fall to the ground like a puppet. We know what to do. Jim throws a grenade into the next room. We hear shouting, and then a loud explosion followed by a final scream. A german helmet lands in front of us.\n\nMe, Jim, and Alex run up the stairs. Jim guards the stairs, just like he said he would. Alex mounts his machinegun on the windowsill, and I look through the scope and look out the window.\n\nI see hell, as dozens of Wehrmacht soldiers storm houses and execute our fellow american soldiers. Alex can't watch anymore. Wehrmacht take cover as Alex mow them down. American soldiers still fighting in the streets, being shot by snipers from other buildings thank us, though many lose their lives because of the Wehrmacht. Only the ones taking complete cover still live. And yet, a large group of US forces enter the street from home base, half of them shot to death by the large force of Wehrmacht machinegunners and snipers.\n\nSuddenly, Alex just falls down, and his helmet rolls of his head. Blood oozes out through his forehead. I will never forget the shock on Jim's face, and the expression on the face of the corpse.\n\nMy turn. I like through the scope and look to the windows of Nazi-occupied windows. I pass a lot of empty windows, but then I see one with a sniper. He is aiming down the scope to the streets, right at the head of an american soldier. CRACK. Fire erupts from the barrel of the sniper, and the soldier lies dead. Now the sniper is aiming at another soldier. My turn. CRACK. A bullet meets his head, and I am happy to have fired it. His helmet flies off. I now look to the streets. A group of Wehrmacht are taking cover behind the remnants of a wall, one of them being a machinegunner, firing hundreds of bullets per second. CRACK. His gun stops shooting, and while the gunner hits the ground, the group look for me. I get down to hide, but It's too late. One of them saw me, and now shouts "Scharfschütze!"\n\nA loud BANG erupts, and the oddly loud noise of a swish hits me. I realize what happened. A german must have fired a Panzerschrek towards me. I yell at Jim to take cover, and then a rocket hits the wall next to the window. I go deaf for a moment. Then I hear German soldier yelling at eachother below me. Jim looks at me with the face he makes when he is scared. Then he looks back down the stairs.\n\nGerman boots hit the ground. Sweat runs off the palms of both of us. I try telling him we need to parachute out the window, to escape, but Jim refuses. "Stick to the plan," he says. Then he starts firing.\n\nI can tell he's having trouble with the recoil, because soon the bullets go further up, and a Nazi has a chance to aim at him and...\n\nThe Wehrmacht soldier pulls the trigger. Jim stops shooting. Jim just looks at the ground. Then a great red puddle forms beneath him. Jim is dead. Alex is dead. That american soldier we just met. Dead. I have two choices. Jump out the window, or avenge Jim (or die trying). Second option sounds appealing. I will never bow down to this tyranny. I am a soldier, and I will fight it.\n\nI approach the stairs. I know I am going to die. I know we are going to lose this battle. But to me, that doesn't matter. I will be together with my brothers, and every day of defeat, is another chance at victory.","January 4","true","4.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game had many online competitive ladders for the years it was being played. DODS is a relatively fast paced shooter, requiring steady aim and understanding of every gun and how it feels.\nAlthough an older game now, I feel the gameplay is similar to that of COD II but with the feel of the source engine.\n\nWorth buying in the modern day, this game still holds itself as a good WW2 era shooter.","September 27, 2014","true","6.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The americans captured the middle flag and pushed us to the last 2 remaining flags. Shortly after they captured the fourth (farm) flag and we only held our spawn flag. We were on the brink of defeat because everybody in our team were dying over and over but then the two of us stood up and started to push them back. I went around the road through the farm flag and managed to capture it, killing 3 enemies along the way while my brother cleared the houses up to the middle flag. We met up in the middle , shot everyone who where trying to get there and we took it back. Then we finally received reinforcements from our team and we were ready to push the fight to the americans. Our team charged both of their flags and won the round in just over a minute.\nMoments like these are awesome in this game and they alone are worth playing the game.\n\nStrategy in DoD:S is more than important and it's so awesome that this FPS game even allows you to do that, ie: well selected classes, good positioned MG's and snipers, smoke grenades - all make a difference in this game. Although alot of strategy may be involved in this game, it's still kinda feels like a classic FPS arcade game with good graphics and source engine which makes it play great. The only shame is that alot of people don't want or try to play as squad or a team to capture or defend flags, in most servers there seems like only 3 - 4 people of total 8-10 ppl in your team try to work together while others are in their own little worlds.\n\nDay of Defeat: Source is a great game, much better than most modern shooters in this day and age and I rate it 9/10","May 10, 2015","true","13.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

However, in its current state of relative obscurity, I would not recommend this, especially to newcomers. People who are good at this game (presumably veterans) seem to be fairly rude and not very helpful; the elitism is strong with this community. There are more grenades than World at War. It feels kind of spray-and-pray-ish to me (although I am a novice so I'm probably wrong). The recoil is crazy on the guns, which I guess is more of a nitpick than anything, but it's annoying. I think the biggest problem is simply that it gets no love, which at this point it will probably never get, and that leaves it in this state of obscurity.","February 19","false","7.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Day of Defeat is essiantly counter strike but set in the world war. You can choose two factions the US or the Germans and you fight it out to win. So how is this game ? This game is actually pretty fun but is no where near as fun as counter strike in my eyes but its still a very good game. Theres not much i can say cause this game is just like counter strike bu there are some diffrences. The maps are way bigger and the guns take some time getting used to. But there are a few negatives i want to talk about. Its quite difficult to find people who play on the official valve servers and not some neon filled maps (even though i kinda like those) but the biggest gripe with this game is the community. If you get on a map thats quite populated you will get kicked off for pretty much anything negative you do. Talking on the mic or playing badly will get you kicked off the server quickly. Overall Day of Defeat Source is  a really good game and without a doubt if you like MP shooters get this game right now. I give Day of Defeat Source an 8/10","February 18, 2015","true","3.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

If you've never played either it might be a better idea to research the differences between the two. Don't worry that you'll be losing players by going to the older one, both offer just as few populated servers.\n\nI've played a lot of DoD in my day, since the first days of the mod WAY before it was overhauled into what is known as 'original dod' / Day of Defeat on the steam store. Before the overhaul the game was basically a WW2 Team Death Match with 3 points per map. Maps were very crude. Suddenly the mod was overhauled and Valve suddenly became interested after millions of people downloaded it in only a few months, essentially it was the next counter-strike in the day and fell into the hands of valve, back then that wasn't bad.\n\nEven though it say's I have 2 hours of DoD source, I've played since launch. Out of the big source port overs (CS:Source, DoD:Source, TF2) this is definetly the crappier one in contrast to it's original. They simply nerfed it and tried to simplify it, I believe they were trying to stream line it back in the day, but honestly TF2 has more variety then this, and it didn't lose any in contrast to TF:Classic. DoD for HL1 has a lot more diversity for weapon selection, sadly in this version the Axis have very 'unforgiving' weapons that may do slightly more damage, but are horrible to control, while Allies weapons may generally do less damage but are all way more forgiving for recoil; Basically, the original gave both those 'forgiving', 'unforgiving' weapons to both teams except in a couple classes.\n\nThey also completely removed the british. The US didn't fight the entire war. Any 3 year old knows that.","December 8, 2015","false","2.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/StefanJH/recommended/300/","StefanJH","Stef","http://steamcommunity.com/id/StefanJH/","32 products in account","Deutsche Volksgenossen und -genossinnen!\n\nSieben Jahre sind eine kurze Zeit, der Bruchteil eines einzelnen menschlichen normalen Lebens - eine Sekunde kaum im Leben eines Volkes. Und doch scheinen die hinter uns liegenden sieben Jahre länger zu sein als viele Jahrzehnte der Vergangenheit. In ihnen hallt sich zusammen ein großes geschichtliches Erlebnis: die Wiederauferstehung einer von der Vernichtung bedrohten Nation. Eine unendlich ereignisreiche Zeit, die uns, die wir sie nicht nur erleben, sondern zum Teil gestalten durften, manches Mal kaum überblickbar zu sein scheint.\n\nWir reden heute sehr oft von demokratischen Idealen; das heißt nicht in Deutschland, sondern in der anderen Welt wird davon geredet. Denn wir in Deutschland haben ja dieses demokratische Ideal einst zur Genüge kennengelernt; wenn die andere Welt also heute wieder dieses Ideal preist, so können wir darauf zunächst nur erwidern, daß dieses Ideal das deutsche Volk ja mindestens 15 Jahre lang in Reinkultur kennenzulernen Gelegenheit hatte, und wir selbst haben ja nur das Erbe dieser Demokratie angetreten.\n\nWir bekommen jetzt wunderbare Kriegsziele vorgesetzt, besonders von englischer Seite. England ist ja in der Proklamation von Kriegszielen erfahren, da es die meisten Kriege der Welt geführt hat. Es sind wunderbare Kriegsziele, die uns heute verkündet werden. Es soll ein neues Europa entstehen. Dieses Europa soll erfüllt sein dann von Gerechtigkeit, und diese allgemeine Gerechtigkeit macht ja dann auch Rüstungen überflüssig, es soll dann abgerüstet werden. Durch diese Abrüstung soll dann die wirtschaftliche Blüte beginnen, Handel und Wandel sollen dann eintreten, und zwar hauptsächlich Handel, viel Handel, freier Handel! Und unter diesem Handel, da soll dann die Kultur blühen, und nicht nur die Kultur, sondern auch die Religion soll dann wieder gedeihen. Mit einem Wort: es soll jetzt endlich das goldene Zeitalter kommen. Dieses goldene Zeitalter ist uns nur leider schon einige Male so ähnlich illustriert worden, und zwar nicht einmal von vergangenen Generationen, sondern von den selben Leuten, die es heute wieder beschreiben. Es sind ziemlich alte, abgeleierte Platten. Und es können einem die Herren wirklich leid tun, die nicht irgendeinen neuen Gedanken gefunden haben, mittels dem man vielleicht ein großes Volk wieder würde ködern können, denn das hat man ja im allgemeinen schon im Jahre 1918 versprochen; das damalige Kriegsziel der Engländer war ja auch das "neue Europa", die "neue Gerechtigkeit", diese neue Gerechtigkeit, die das Selbstbestimmungsrecht der Völker als wesentlichstes Element beseitigen sollte. Damals versprach man ja auch schon eine Gerechtigkeit, die das Tragen von Waffen in der Zukunft überflüssig erscheinen lassen würde. Daher auch damals bereits das Programm der Abrüstung, und zwar der Abrüstung aller. Und um diese Abrüstung nun besonders sinnfällig zu machen, sollte diese Abrüstung gekrönt werden durch einen Bund der abgerüsteten Nationen, die ja nun entschlossen sein sollten, in der Zukunft alle ihre Differenzen - daß es noch einige Differenzen geben würde, daran zweifelte man damals wenigstens noch nicht -, also diese Differenzen sollten nun ja, wie das so üblich ist unter den Demokratien, dann in freier Rede, in Gegenrede und Wechselrede weggeredet werden. Es sollte auf keinen Fall mehr geschossen werden. Und damals sagte man auch schon, daß die Folge dieser Abrüstung und dieses allgemeinen Weltparlaments dann eine ungeheuere Blüte sein würde, ein Aufblühen der Industrien und insbesondere auch - es wird das immer besonders betont - ein Aufblühen des Handels, des freien Handels. Auch die Kultur sollte dabei nicht zu kurz kommen, und von der Religion hat man ja allerdings am Ende des Krieges damals etwas weniger gesprochen wie jetzt am Beginn, aber immerhin, man erklärte uns wenigstens noch im Jahre 1918, daß es ein gesegnetes und Gott wohlgefälliges Zeitalter werden sollte.\n\nWas nun gekommen war, das erleben wir: man hat die alten Staaten zerschlagen, ohne auch nur einmal die Völker zu befragen. In keinem einzigen Fall hat man damals erst die Nationen gefragt, ob sie denn mit den Maßnahmen einverstanden sein würden, die man mit ihnen vorhatte. Man hat alte, historisch gewordene Körper - nicht nur staatliche Körper, sondern auch wirtschaftliche Körper - aufgelöst; man konnte an ihre Stelle nichts Besseres stellen, denn was sich im Laufe von Jahrhunderten gebildet hatte, war wahrscheinlich an sich schon das Bessere gewesen - auf keinen Fall konnten die Leute etwas Besseres hinsetzen, die der ganzen europäischen Geschichte ohnehin nur mit größter Arroganz gegenüberstanden. So hat man ohne Rücksicht auf das Selbstbestimmungsrecht der Völker Europa zerhackt, Europa aufgerissen, große Staaten aufgelöst, Nationen rechtlos gemacht, indem man sie zuerst wehrlos machte, und dann endlich eine Einteilung getroffen, die von vornherein Sieger und Besiegte auf dieser Welt übrigließ. Man sprach dann auch nicht mehr von Abrüstung, sondern im Gegenteil, man rüstete weiter. Denn man hat auch dann nicht etwa begonnen, nun die Konflikte friedlich zu bereinigen, sondern im Gegenteil, die gerüsteten Staaten führten Kriege genau wie zuvor. Nur die Abgerüsteten waren nicht mehr in der Lage, sich die Gewalttaten der Gerüsteten zu verbitten oder gar vom Leibe zu halten. Parallel damit kam natürlich auch nicht die wirtschaftliche Wohlfahrt, sondern im Gegenteil, ein wahnsinniges System von Reparationen führte zu einer wirtschaftlichen Verelendung nicht nur der sogenannten Besiegten, sondern auch der Sieger selber. Die Folgen dieser wirtschaftlichen Verelendung hat kein Volk mehr gespürt als das deutsche. Die allgemeine wirtschaftliche Desorganisation führte gerade bei uns zu einer Erwerbslosigkeit, an der unser deutsches Volk zugrunde zu gehen schien. Auch die Kultur hat keine Förderung erfahren, sondern im Gegenteil, sie wurde vernarrt und verzerrt. Die Religion trat ganz in den Hintergrund; in diesen 15 Jahren hat sich kein Engländer der Religion erinnert; kein Engländer sich der christlichen Barmherzigkeit oder der Nächstenliebe erinnert. Da sind die Herren nicht mit der Bibel spazierengegangen, sondern da war ihre Bibel der Vertrag von Versailles! Das waren 448 Paragraphen, die alle nur eine Belastung, eine Verpflichtung, eine Verurteilung und eine Erpressung Deutschlands oder an Deutschland darstellten. Und dieses Versailles wurde garantiert von dem neuen Völkerbund - nicht einem Bund der freien Nationen, der gleichen Nationen, überhaupt gar keinem Völkerbund - die eigentliche begründende Nation blieb von Anfang an ferne -, sondern einem Völkerbund, dessen einzige Aufgabe es war, dieses gemeinste Diktat, das man nicht ausgehandelt hatte, sondern das man uns einfach aufbürdete, zu garantieren und uns zu zwingen, dieses Diktat zu erfüllen.\n\nDas war die Zeit nun des demokratischen Deutschlands! Wenn heute fremde Staatsmänner oft so tun, als ob man zum jetzigen Deutschland kein Vertrauen haben könnte, so konnte dies auf keinen Fall doch auf das damalige Deutschland zutreffen; denn dieses damalige Deutschland war ja ihre Geburt, ihr ureigenstes Werk, dazu konnten sie doch Vertrauen haben!","December 23, 2015","true","19.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"
