The control scheme -- as many other reviewers have mentioned -- is just simply too clunky for the game to be much fun.\n\nWhat I mean is, mostly, it's hard to really classify this as a platformer (albeit a puzzle platformer, even) because everything is always interrupted a thousand times by clunkily shooting arrows.  As others have mentioned (again), you have to click on the KNIGHT in order to change between shot types as well.\n\nFor now I'm going to give this a "No".. but I really do think there's something good here as far as the concept and level design.  If the controls were patched SOMEHOW I'd give the game another shot for sure.","October 22, 2015","false","2.9"," 42 of 51 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","42","51","0","0"

You're given an ability, but you're incredibly limited by it. Imagine if the Flash could only run on sidewalks, or if Batman could only grapple onto white outcroppings. Sure, the game would be incredibly easy if everything could have an arrow in it, but the amount you're limited saps the game of any fun.\n\nThe physics aren't all that great either. Everything feels very loose. Boxes are way lighter than they look, and if you're standing on an arrow you shot at an angle you'll slide down it. The visuals are awful as well. I'd expect this level of quality from a free flash game, but charging a dollar is ridiculous.\n\nAnother major issue I have is the way you select arrows. In the level it tells you about it in, it says to click the Tinboy dude. This shows three bubbles, each representing a different arrow. The hitbox for triggering the menu is way off, resulting in you opening the menu for switching arrows when you try to shoot. What makes this worse is that you can also switch arrows by pressing 1, 2, and 3. There's no options menu to change any of this either.\n\nI honestly cannot reccomend this to anyone, not even for the 14 cents its been available for this week.","November 6, 2015","false","0.6"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

Check out the video to get a sense of the gameplay or read my quick review below.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OBXKkQfxB0\n\nTinboy is a puzzle-platform game in the 8bit style.  Players must make their way through various levels of an AI Testing Arena, starting at one door and navigating various platforms and obstacles to reach an exit.  They are aided in this by the use of a multi-purpose bow which can fire ordinary arrows, rope arrows or exploding arrows. Each arrow type enables the player to affect different game mechanics.\n\nPros:\n+puzzles have a basic structure but could be solved a number of ways\n+mechanics are simple but allow for depth of level design\n+puzzles appear to be well thought out\n+challenging enough to maintain interest\n+difficulty scales in a reasonable way\n\nCons:\n-some controls are not intuitive (double jump to release rope, finicky bow aiming method)\n-UI is a little unintuitive (surely an ESC menu for quitting isn't too much to ask)\n-No options menu (for turning down/off game audio, for example or rebinding keys)\n-Graphics get a bit fuzzy when upscaled.\n-Doesn't fully support a controller (it would play better with a controller, imho)\n\nIt's a pretty fun, little puzzle-platformer and, for the price they're asking, it's worth it. So, I'll give it a thumbs up.","September 6, 2015","true","0.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

This is by far the most boring game I have played in a while. Even though there are some challening levels, some of them are stupidly hard just because the gameplay is absolutely trash. I mean.. sure, game costs just a dollar/euro, even lower when on sale, and it has trading cards, but it simply doesn't make up for the quality of this game. It's not the worst game I have ever played, it's just too basic for a platformer. Uninteresting repetitive level design, almost every level just about the same. Only thing that could save this dull experience would be a great soundtrack. But I think you've already guessed it - it's gruesome.

If I where to pick one thing out, the controls are a bit unresponsive. People do tend to have trouble with the drawback mechanism, but its only problem is it's a bit unresponsive unless you pull back horizontally, which in most cases you need to shoot on an angle, and the clicking on the character to change weapon types isn't too bad either. One suggestion I would make is to change the overall layout, like making an HUD where you can press 1 to use standard arrows, 3 for explosives, and 2 for grappiling hook. It's a simple game and it is challenging, not because of the controls, but because it's a difficult game, and welcomingly so. Overall, it's a good way to waste time if you really have nothing else to do or if you enjoy a good challenge especially for the price. It costs as much as a crappy iPhone game but it has better quality, and not to mention the 200 FPS gameplay, and I don't even have a good graphics card.","November 4, 2015","true","4.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

It seems fun and it has a lot of potential. I really like the whole platforming puzzle aspect of it. It's a fairly unique concept and I hope you continue to improve it.\n\nThat said I would recommend you work on the controls of this game. They are a little clunky and could use some work. I also thing you could add some more sound to it. It's a little quiet. Even some simple beats can go a long way. I'm not hating on you, I know this is probably one of your first tries at a game and I appreciate it.\n\nI know it sounds weird put it kind of feels portal ish. Like trying to find a way to the end of the level by using your bow and arrow instead of the portal gun.\n\nDon't give up! I really like it and I hope to see more of your work :D","February 9","false","0.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I started to have fun actually but that was until i arrived to the 3rd or 4th level than I realized how bad the controls are and the level design is aweful the concept had potential  like shoot arrows to complete the level but it didn't worked here.","April 29","false","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
