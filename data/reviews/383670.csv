That's how I would sum this up in one word. I suspect other negative reviews of the game may focus on the fact that it looks like a two-bit Newgrounds game, but the weaknesses of a visual novel can be forgiven as long as there is a compelling story, strong writing, and an enjoyable atmosphere that go along with the game. This has none of that. I bought the game because it had all the things I enjoy--New Orleans, Deadlands, film noir, religious undertones--but I couldn't get past the awful writing, generic "jazz" music, and terrible static art that start this game out. There's nothing here for anyone to enjoy. It should have been torn apart by several editors before it made its way to Steam.","July 3, 2015","false","0.1"," 119 of 163 people (73%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","73","119","163","8","2"

Episode 1 has had "minor updates," so some of the information in this review might be outdated.\n\nI don't want to pile on here, and I wouldn't go so far as "dreadful," but yeah, this isn't very good. It feels really rushed, character development is largely tell not show, and things mostly happen one after the other for no apparent reason. If you choose poorly, you just get rescued. Nothing really matters. There's one random choice that will lead to an explanation of a major plot point and give you an important item. If you don't make that choice you still get the item; it comes out of nowhere.\n\nIn addition to the plot issues, as a visual novel it's technically pretty sloppy. There are weird things like narration in character dialog windows and single choice decisions. There's no CG gallery with percent completion, even after playing through once.\n\nConsidering that the whole thing ends with an ad for the Deadlands Noir tabletop RPG, it probably just should have been free. There are trading cards (set of 5), though, which isn't currently listed on the store page (oh, it's in the description, but not the sidebar), so if it's on sale for fourteen cents it might be worth buying.","July 4, 2015","false","2.8"," 53 of 68 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","53","68","3","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Shadocchi/recommended/383670/","Shadocchi","マジレズ✰Shadow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Shadocchi/","334 products in account","Edit: Please note that this review concerns the initial release of this game (episode one).\n\nGames made to advertise other games aren’t particularly uncommon, and for choice-based games, you only have to look as far as Love In Space’s Sunrider Academy or (as a more relevant example) Epiphany Games’ Majestic Nights series to see that it’s very much a thing. But while most tie-ins put in the effort, That Old Time Religion doesn’t.\n\nThe crux of it is that That Old Time Religion wasn’t made to be a visual novel. Everything about it points to being an illustrated short story shoved into Ren’py, given a rolling music track from the main product and a few choice points. The game really shows a lack of understanding of what visual novels are, what they can be, or at the very least shows the lack of thought that went into this whole endeavour.\n\nWhile I can empathise that making a visual novel isn’t easy – even if you’ve made plenty of other games before – there’s just too much thoughtlessness here to ignore. The options that ultimately don’t lead to consequence, the art being a handful of stills, the narration sometimes not matching the art, the narration intruding on the dialogue, the music not entirely suiting the action, the default Ren’py UI, the default resolution, the lack of sound effects, and a bunch of things that come down to taste just gets in the way of any experience you could have.\n\nFuture content is promised, but I doubt any additions would change this without giving the whole thing an overhaul. As a visual novel it’s lazy, as an introduction to the RPG it lacks flair; the only thing it suits is publication in a place targeting existing fans. It’s honestly disappointing to see established developers create this and think it’s remotely good enough. Play it if you’re desperate.","July 11, 2015","false","1.1"," 36 of 50 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","36","50","0","2"

Now, considering that Deadlands was more-or-less a transposing of Call of Cthulhu-style antics into a Western (read: cowboy) setting, I'm not quite sure what the purpose of transposing Call of Cthulhu-style antics into a 1930s setting is, considering that that's precisely when the original Call of Cthulhu RPG was set anyway!  BUT...I'm not here to query the existence of a tabletop RPG, I'm here to review a video game/"visual novel" set in that universe.  So get awn wit' it, already!\n\nNow, while I played plenty of Fighting Fantasy-style gamebooks when I was young, and read the occasional "Choose Your Own Adventure"-style book as well, I'm not going to pretend that I'm especially well-versed in the world of the "visual novel".   I've played a couple, and that's about it.  And in all honesty, they're not a medium terribly well-suited to yours truly, considering that I speed-read too fast to become truly immersed in whatever it is that I'm reading, and, well, basically, that's the main thing which these kinds of "games" are comprised of:  Reading!  I'll further add that I'm a little ambivalent about the VALUE of text-based adventure games in an era where video games are capable of graphics arguably more convincing than a lot of the CGI you see in BLOCKBUSTER MOVIES these days (♥♥♥♥ you all, I'll take the visual aesthetic of Bioshock Infinite or Outlast over a frigging MARVEL or recent PETER JACKSON movie, any day)!   But again I digress, as I'm here to attempt to objectively review this game for what it is, rather than query the very validity of its existence at all.\n\nSo how does this stack up as a "visual novel", given my understanding of what this genre aims to achieve?  Well, the visuals themselves are...well...they're okay.  A bit sub-standard considering the whole nature of the project, but certainly nowhere near "bad" enough to significantly diminish the experience...though there's precious few images actually on offer (perhaps mercifully), and they don't always illustrate what is being described in the text 100% accurately (invisible fedoras, anyone?)!  So what about...the writing?  Well, being a "noir" (read: detective) piece, the writing is certainly appropriate and on the whole, pretty good...sure it's not Raymond Chandler, but whad'ya expect?  It's fine, it really is, and even served me up the occasional chuckle.  Try this one on for size:  "He looked as nervous as a rabbit at a coyote convention."  Now, if that don't float ya boat, then you're probably not gonna have a very good time here.  It certainly does "the job" it's meant to do, in my humble opinion.  As does the music, which is nice enough without being anything to write home about.  Unless your mother is especially into a mix of moody jazz and pseudo-orchestral horror movie soundtracks (in which case she'll probably appreciate your letter).\n\nWhat about...story?  Hoo boy.  Here's the kicker.  IT'S REALLY FRICKING SHORT.  How short?!  Well, under an hour, if you read as quickly as me...maybe an hour-and-a-half if you're a super-slow reader.  And "gameplay"?  Well...again, I'm not sure I made much more than about eight to ten "decisions" during the course of the entire game!  Sure, none of those led to me DYING, so maybe you get a bit more bang for your buck if you DO manage to snuff yourself at some point; and perhaps there's even a teeny, tiny bit of replayability* if you start all over again, and make a few different choices here and there.  But there's no surely no justification for the four-dollar asking price.  Oh, and it ends with an ADVERTISEMENT for the tabletop game, so if its main purpose is to be a shameless advertisement for an altogether different product...maybe it's worth a BUCK, if that?!  (FREE also occurs to me as a reasonable price-tag, but let's not quibble.)\n\nIf I haven't managed to talk you out of it yet, at least wait until a significant sale.  Consider this a very WEAK recommendation at best, and only at a bargain-basement price.\n\nVerdict: 5/10.\n\n(* Google tells me that "replayability" isn't a real word.  Google can go ♥♥♥♥ itself.  I'M OLDER THAN IT IS, SO IT CAN LEARN TO RESPECT ITS ♥♥♥♥ING ELDERS, SO IT CAN.)","July 4, 2015","true","4.3"," 43 of 67 people (64%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","64","43","67","17","4"

Especially for Detective Harvey Jenkins\n\nThis visual novel takes place in New Orleans, 1935. You are Harvey Jenkins, a private investigator who if compelled to take the next job since times are so rough. Things aren't always as they seem in this noir detective novel, beware of the supernatural! You will be surprised.\n\nThis game comes with 2 episodes and took be about 3 hours to complete. The rest of the game time was to achieve the card drops since I typically don't replay these games for multiple endings. If you still want to get the achievements though, you can save prior to any decision and quickly get them by reloading the game from that point. Most achievements happen after a major decision.\n\nNearly all of the negative comments are from people that don't know what to expect from a visual novel or people that only gave a few minutes of their time. I was pretty happy with this offering. The price is good at $4, and you get a fair amount of content and a decent detective story.\n\nWorth the $4; usually on sale for much less! If you see this cheap and like VN's try it out!\n\nAccidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful? Either way join this group for more.

If only a considerable amount of time was sacrificed by others in order to understand what the game truly depicts, knowing it reflects a 1930's dark noir and supernatural setting, then the outcome will be splendid.\n\nBut I have enjoyed it nevertheless, and of course will be looking forward to the upcoming episodes.","October 13, 2015","true","3.7"," 22 of 33 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","22","33","0","1"

This is 'Film Noir' without the film.\n\nStories are set in 1935 New Orleans, Harvey Jenkins is a man about town who has unlikely friends and makes powerful enemies.  But that is what happens when one is a private detective that takes on unusual cases, those of the supernatural kind.  He and John Constantine (Vertigo comics Hellblazer/2005 movie) are much alike, one foot in Hell and the other in Heaven.\n\nNearly a kinetic visual novel but reads and plays like Choose Your Own Adventure game.  Make your choices and see what happens, just try not to die - again.\n\nGame consists of two stand alone episodes, with options for autoplay or having the story contents read (computer voice, so no voice actors).  About 90 minutes an episode, if slow like me (and/or get interrupted).\n\nWorth the read, and asking price, for a nice blend of a visual novel that has choose your own adventure choices.","May 7","true","4.9"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

I've attempted to play quite a few visual novels over the past couple years that came in bundles and not many were worth playing more than 5 minutes.

There's only really 3 times in the game were your choices lead to different outcomes but overall don't impact the story to much.  The music is not bad and sometimes is quite good.  I found the writing enganging if you like the whole 1930's noir PI trope.  The occult bits in the game too were mostly good and  that made this short PG-13 choose your own adventure experience worth finishing.  Easy to reload those 3 turning points to get all the achievements as well if that's your thing. 6/10 - If you don't like the trope probably not for you.
