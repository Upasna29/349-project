I guess what I would sum it up as would be "Old school platformers meet Metroid meet Ikaruga." It doesn't really bring anything new and innovative to the table mechanic wise, but it does mesh them well against a unique art style.\n\nUnfortunately the keys are not rebindable, a pretty basic feature that I would have expected, especially in a game where response needs to be fast and intuitive. I struggled with the default keyboard keys - switching to gamepad made it a lot easier. The settings are minimalistic. Resolution & Vsync, that's your lot.\n\nI'm struggling a little with the combat; I'm not sure if enemies vary widely in difficulty, or if I'm just incredibly slow sometimes. I often find myself repeating segments and suffering trial-by-patience but I imagine a large part of that is my inexperience with platformers. The puzzle parts for me far exceed the action. I've found them very engaging and well designed.\n\nIt's far from perfect; but in my humble opinion it's a pretty high quality game and excellent value entertainment for a full price of £5. Sadly I can't comment on the co-op until one of my friends goes ahead and buys it... hint hint.","September 29, 2014","true","15.8"," 43 of 47 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","43","47","0","4"

There are so many cases in which I don't wanna choose between recommending a game or not. Sometimes there are certain aspects of a game I like and others that I don't. How can I, the reviewer *always* have the right answer for you, the reader? Someone I don't even know personally? Someone I have no idea what they want and expect from a game? Sometimes I just wanna post my own analysis without a "sentence" attached to it. Anyway, small rant aside, I enjoyed Outland.\n\nThe game's theming surprised me right away. I don't know why, but I was expecting something futuristic/space themed, but the game is set in a very "primal" and mystical environment. With spirituality and shamans and all that (the whole bright neon blue/red colors probably made me think of Tron).\n\nThe game feels like it's going to be boring right away, with enemies and platforming sections that don't do much to challenge the player, but this changes quickly.\nSoon in the game (could've been sooner, IMO) you will acquire the power to shift between light (blue) and dark (red). While blue, you are immune to blue projectiles and can harm red enemies. The same goes for red: immune to red projectiles, can harm blue enemies. This allows the game to come up with scenarios that would be impossible to traverse without these mechanics and soon you'll find yourself quickly shifting between colors in order to avoid damage. Not only that, but new enemies appear later on providing the game with some variety to the combat and the platforming sections become increasingly complex. The game achieves a nice middle ground between action/combat and platforming (often having them both at the same time as you are forced to fight enemies in the middle of a barrage of projectiles).\n\nThe game can be very challenging at certain points, but due to the abundance of checkpoints spread across the levels, powerups that allow you to quickly dispatch more... problematic enemies for a small energy cost and the occasional health upgrade, you never feel like you are being punished for making mistakes when figuring out the best course of action to tackle the challenges presented to you. The boss battles offer similar variety of action and strategy, and I would even go as far as calling some of them puzzles, because you really need to figure out what's going on in order to beat them.\n\nFinally, the game has a few collectible masks that are hidden in out of the way areas or protected by harder-than-average platforming/enemy sections which unlock concept art or something. I think this may give some replayability to the game, but I don't know. I'm not a completionist, don't care much for these... still, I felt like pointing it out that it is a thing you can do if you're into that sort of thing.\n\nNow what *don't* I like about the game?\n\nWell I can think of a few things, but even though I don't consider them enough reason to warrant this a negative review, some bias is in place (you will see what I mean) and you may find yourself disagreeing with me.\n\nFirst of all, if my profile picture wasn't enough of a givaway, I play most games with a controller if I can help it... and while I can't say such is the case, I've heard a lot of complaints regarding the controls and calling this a poor PC port. I don't know if that's true, but it's probably better to play this with a controller if you have one just to be safe, or look for other reviews that may explain this issue in more detail if you don't. Personally, using a controller felt fine most of the time with the exception of the color shift command being bound to one of the shoulder buttons which can make it a bit clunky during the combat sections (I would have preferred a face button for this).\n\nAnother thing I'm not a big fan of (and this isn't as big an issue as the previous one) is that the animations for your attacks do not match the hitboxes very well, specially for the upwards swing. A lot of the time it'll look like you hit an enemy when you actually didn't and will be annoying until you get used to it. And this really is the only solution to it in the end isn't it? Get used to it. Not ideal.\n\nBottomline I guess I recommend this game? I mean, if the gameplay I described above sounds fun to you and you can get past the issues I mentioned, then I guess you'll enjoy it? I don't know, I'm not you.\nStill, I had more good things to say about it than negative ones, so I guess it is a positive review.\n\nThanks for reading!","October 16, 2015","true","6.1"," 37 of 47 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","37","47","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Auburok/recommended/305050/","Auburok","Auburok","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Auburok/","581 products in account","Outland is one of my favorite downloadable games from the last console generation, and I'm extremely happy that it was ported to PC. The only strange thing about the port is that achievements unlock after you close the game. Weird, but it's okay. (Edit: this has been addressed in patches)\n\nOutland is something of a simple metroidvania with an Ikaruga color-changing mechanic. Players can change between light and dark after an early section of the game and use these forms to attack opposite aligned enemies, harmlessly absorb same-colored bullets and beams, and interact with the environment. There's a somewhat large world to explore and plenty of bosses to take down. The game features an arcade mode with leaderboards, and a coop mode that has a few specific levels. There is also some cooperative stuff in the game - some specific coop challenges and the main campaign allows coop (though due to the nature of the game, only the host progresses).\n\nThe player's main weapon is a sword, and combat is very quick and simple. There are some upgrades to the player's abilities, but no alternate weapons, armor, etc (the game doesn't really need them).\n\nThe game is absolutely gorgeous, especially at high resolutions and it's pretty to see in motion. The story is very much something of an origin/creation story for a different world, and it's kind of neat, but don't expect a ton of character development, spoken dialog, etc. If there's a reason to buy this game, it's delicious eye-candy and solid gameplay.","September 29, 2014","true","14.5"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","21","25","0","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/recommended/305050/","pepsimanvsjoe","pepsimanvsjoe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/","1281 products in account","Outland, the action-platformer by Housemarque, originally came out on the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 over three years ago. It was a good game then, it's still a good game today.\n\nFirst off let's discuss the port. It's decent, but could be better. For whatever reason the vsync locks at 30 fps, which causes frame-rate judders. The alternative is to turn off in-game vsync and then force it on via your videocard's control panel. I tried this but somehow I still got screen-tearing. Maybe I just suck at computers. Also there's no option to turn off vibration if you're using a 360 pad. Never been a fan of force feedback, so needless to say I didn't like this. The image-quality is a bit too soft as well. It supports resolutions at and above 1920x1080 but I dunno, it feels like it could use some AA, that would make the art-direction really stand out.\n\nUsually when people talk about this game they mention a shump called Ika...ikar...? Oh right. Kid Icarus. Yep that old Nintendo game about Greek Mythology and Eggplant Wizards. Seriously though, the world the hero explores is governed by light and dark(or blue bullets and red bullets). Early on you're given a sword and not long after that, the ability to switch between light & dark(blue & red). When you want to absorb bullets or lasers you should be the same color, when you want to attack enemies you have to be the opposite color. Your color can also affect objects such as floating platforms or spikes. Expect numerous situations to crop up where you have to switch between colors constantly to proceed. This isn't a puzzle game but you will have to think every now and then, at least for a moment.\n\nSwitching colors isn't always an option. For example, you might run into a red enemy while area is filled with red bullets. The trick here is to use one of your special attacks. These can include a power strike, a laser, and flashy explosion. Next up are the exploratory powers. Certain powers can be attained to make getting around easier. In typical fashion, previous areas can be explored to find more cash, life/energy upgrades, and concept art unlocks. Fair warning, this is the full extent of the exploration in this game.\n\nMain reason I enjoy this game is it's just so fluid. Back when it came out in 2011 I started the demo thinking "Well...whatever..I guess I gotta try it." I immediately fell in love with its smooth controls, responsive moves, and that wall-jump. There's nothing better than a good wall-jump. So many games these days have them, but they rarely get it right. Outland's wall-jump is smooth, clean, and tight. Just running, jumping, and slashing also feel real good. Exploration is solid as well, though as I mentioned this game is mostly linear, so it's not like you'll miss any huge optional areas if you don't check around. On the other hand, at least you don't have to slash every wall in the hopes of finding a secret. Most of these areas are clearly marked by a cracked wall, a hole big enough to slide through, etc.\n\nThere are also a handful of boss-fights. There is a slight puzzle element involved with each fight, and constant slashing won't get you anywhere. One of the minor additions to the PC version is that there are checkpoints during boss-battles. It's a nice gesture, though I figure most people will get stuck at the final boss. The finale doesn't really have any checkpoints either, so you'll definitely want to have all the life upgrades.\n\nContent-wise you should get your money's worth. The first play-through is likely going to take about 5 hours, 6-7 depending on how fast you can collect everything. While there isn't a hard difficulty or anything, there is an arcade mode. Basically this cuts the world up into stages, and your goal is to shoot for the high score. Housemarque did a fine job designing this game with an arcade mindset. There's a time limit to account for and a multiplier bonus that continually rises, just as long as you don't take any damage. The arcade mode is definitely worth checking out. There's also online co-op. Story & Arcade mode are available as well as special co-op challenges. The real challenge however is finding somebody to play this game with. Hopefully you'll have better luck than I.\n\nTo sum it all up, Outland's strengths are in its controls, its audiovisual direction, and its focused arcade-like game design. If you go in expecting some Metroidvania you're gonna be severely disappointed. This isn't a exploration-heavy game, and there definitely aren't any sweet rare drops. Outland does well in most everything it sets out to do, so it deserves my every recommendation.","September 30, 2014","true","7.2"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","18","22","0","0"

Now if you have read my other reviews I often like making comparisons to other games to start so this for most intents and purposes, is any open world 2D platformer mixed with the likes of the Bullet Hell Ikaruga. I want to avoid using the term Metroidvania because I don't like it as well as from what I see this game does not fully represent that.\n\nThe Ikaruga nod is for obvious reasons. However combining it with a platformer makes it a rather unique endeavor.\n\nThe art, the animation is gorgeous. In addition to this the combat and traversal feels smooth and agile. For me personally, it reminded me of Marvel's Black Panther. The combat has slides, lift attacks, aerial combo's that make combat albeit a bit (for want of a better word) 'simplistic' version of Devil May Cry.\n\nYou gain energy that can be used for special abilities which I will leave for you to discover yourself. But I will say their attacks represent a neutral color that affects enemies of either of the main colors.\n\nThe bullet hell aspect becomes something of an art piece if you just stared at the patterns, in true kaleidoscope fashion, however it becomes rather interesting when something that seems completely impassable can be overcome by switching color and jumping through the top and over the other color before switching back to fall through a laser of the opposite. Its makes for a very satisfying experience when a successfully navigated jumping puzzle is solved. At times, not only do you feel you've solved the correct path but you feel like you've bested it. And you can feel your skills grow and your knowledge of how the bullet hell aspect can used to your advantage.\n\nI did have some problems, there are 5 bosses in total. The first three can be beaten rather easily with a couple attempts without much fuss but the last two demand EVERYTHING from your skill set.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=488687867\n\nThey are incredibly satisfying to conquer. But the only way (I feel) that you have a fighting chance is go to almost all the shrines, they are hidden and cost I forget what the currency is called but usually all the money you have upon finding them. I won't say what exact ability and what its used for but its absolutely required to have multiple uses of it to even have a realistic chance of defeating one or both of these two bosses. But despite that small frustration it does not take away from the fantastic experience. The art, animation, combat, traversal, mixed with a fantastic soundtrack makes me wish I had pulled this out of my backlog much sooner and that I could write this with 2 play-thoughs to tell you about.","July 27, 2015","true","6.6"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"

Using both the forces of light and dark you are tasked with ridding the land of evil where ever it lives and returning the world to the peace it once knew.\n\nThe combat and platforming in this title are executed amazingly, controls are almost perfect and the snappy reactions they give make this a pleasure to play. That topped off with cleaver metroidvania level design, a vast world to explore, a huge array of puzzles to best, bullet hells to beat and an army of enemies to overcome will lead to hours of excitement.\n\nThe visuals as mentioned are outstanding; the psychedelic lands you traverse really do submerge you into something akin to dream. The art style is unique and interesting, although all the characters and enemies are cast in an almost silhouette of light they have a life to them that is just hard to explain.\n\nThe music is a great accompaniment to your journey with deep orchestral tones with every boss battle to soft melodic songs like wind whistling through the trees. I found every part of this world thrilling and delightful. The story is as bare bones as it comes, you are a hero go forth and do hero stuff. Sure there is a big bad evil in the world corrupting and twisting everything to its whim, but you don’t have to worry about that, just enjoy the ride.\n\nThis game is a masterpiece and will keep you busy for a while too, especially if you are going after every collectable.

The description says fast paced? I would put it in the "mild" category. It's repetitive. Simple. Slow. Nothing new or innovative. And all of the environments look EXACTLY the same so I never once cared where I was going or why I was going there. The next area will just be a slightly different but still boring as heck platforming section.\n\nGranted- I didn't get the red powerup, I beat the first boss and quit. But guess what? If I play a game for over an hour and it doesn't progress AT ALL in terms of gameplay? Then I'm done. It doesn't matter if the rest of the game is more fun or what. Why doesn't it just pace itself better?\n\nTL;DR (it's okay, this game's not worth your time, really...) This is a rather polished version of a basic platformer you might find on Newgrounds or Coolmath or something similar. Why you would play it if you didn't have any other options is beyond me.","November 4, 2015","false","1.2"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

Typically, I detest playing side-scrollers, though I was 1st inaugriated into gaming in the eighties. I guess, seeing the progression that gaming has made, I just don't like going backwards in time on tech. But, Outland is one of those lovely exceptions. The fluidity of the character's movments, the quality of the sound & graphics, and the atmospheric effects of the game all draw you back for more. That said, skill-type games that require dexterity and speed are not my strong point, so I probably won't progress very far in the game. Since I bought it primarily for the artbook and music, I'm fine with that. And, after my first time looking through the artbook, I have to say I was not disappointed there. Getting the huge discount for the Christmas sale was just an added bonus that succeeded in moving the title from my wishlist to my library. I recommend this game to anyone, really... whether you are into side-scrollers, artwork, or great audio soundtracks.","December 29, 2015","true","9.8"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

The controls are fast and responsive, the art style is unique and has some breathtaking scenes, and the music fits well to the atmosphere. The game has this magical and eerie feeling to it and everything flows so well together that I had no doubts about completing all the coop challenges and even getting all the achievements which is quite rare for me.\n\nHowever, there are a couple of things that could have easily elevated Outland from a very good game into a unforgettable title. As I mentioned above, the game has this great art style and there are some truly breathtaking moments when the player is shown the grand scale of the architecture and some of the enemies. More of these moments could have been appreciated!\n\nThere also could have been more areas without any enemies in order to vary up the gameplay a bit. I feel that the opportunity was there many times where the developers could have shown more of the story without the voice narration.\n\nThe coop challenges are quite fun, though their number is quite low. It is a shame because for that one hour, my coop partner and I had great fun completing them!\n\nBut overall then, this is a very positive recommendation and I am looking forward to the next game by Housemarque (and ported by Knockout Games).","December 22, 2014","true","14.7"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

And you might want to as the levels are rally getting harder later.\n\nI have yet to tey the coop missions, so not sure about that. But the single player experience is good.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/blueazzy17/recommended/305050/","blueazzy17","BlueAzzy17","http://steamcommunity.com/id/blueazzy17/","48 products in account","Outland was a fun platformer that reminded me of Metroid with a sword. The story of the game is not terribly long, taking me order 10 hours to finish. The game builds in challenge nicely without getting too hard too quickly or ever becoming too easy. The collectibles and upgrades were spaced out nicely and didn't feel like a long grind. While the game is pretty much linear, it is clear right away that upgrades from later in the game will be necessary to finish clearing earlier areas, which I consider a plus.\nPositives:\nThe gameplay was great. I thought that the movement by the player and camera were polished weil. The game adds a mechanic of switching between a light and dark orientation, changing what some platforms do and whether some environmental obstacles are harmful or benign. This provides a nice tactic to add depth to what can otherwise be a tired genre. 10/10\nBosses were difficult, but not overly frustrating or complicated. They provided a good challenge, and defeating each one provided a sense of accomplishment. 10/10\nMost of the achievements were non-grindy. (I have 8/12 right now.) The lone exception to this is the achievement to collect 1 million in game currency. After finishing the game and collecting all of the money vases, I only had 77% of this done. Some of the other achievements provided some extra amusement/welcome challenges. 8/10\nCharacter upgrades and collectibles were well spaced. Throughout the campaign, new skills and techniques were provided at a good pace, keeping the game from feeling monotonous. Collectibles could be found in each area, but I thought there was a good balance of adding extra areas to find in areas and not littering the game with meaningless loot. 9/10\nNegatives:\nThe story doesn't do much for the game beyond giving a sense of why you are there and what you are doing. It isn't over the top, in your face, or bad. It is just rather blase. The expose about each boss provides a little context about why you had to fight them, but feel a little contrived. All of this said, in my opinion it is much better to make the story adequate and make great gameplay than the other way around. 5/10\nNo comment:\nI have yet to try the coop challenges.\nOverall:\nA lot of fun. I was a little sad it ended so quickly! However, any extra content may have started to become lengthening the game for the sake of lengthening the game. If there were to be anything added on, it probably would have required new skills as well to add more depth. I would definitely recommend the game to others. I would even go so far to say that I would be interested in a sequel if it were to add new skills or updgrades! 9/10","April 19, 2015","true","9.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

From the store page, I expected a good looking but short and flat indie title with all the usual problems those come with. Instead I got an incredibly well put together, lengthy and polished title, the likes of which I'd expect from a triple A studio. The gorgeous animations, backgrounds, and other visual elements are definitely icing on the cake, but what makes this a great title is the masterful weave of mechanics and abilities with enemy interactions and platforming sections that always makes you feel like you're getting better while progressing through the game.\n\nHighlights\nOutlands learning curve, for me, flowed in a natural progressive way. As a player I found myself constantly wanting to go further and progress just to see what was next. The unlocking of abilities on the way, and the interesting and fun boss fights were like the Golden Stars you got at school when you'd studied well, and really helped up the level of engagement.\n\nThe little details have all clearly had time and effort spent on them making sure they turned out right. Everything from the ability to destroy heart drops to turn them into excess gold when you don't need life, to the placement of new enemies after a platforming section has been thought about by the developer and works together to compliment the players progress.\n\nThe art style and sound deserve special mention, all sticking to various influences from Aztec, Incan, Mayan and even Olmec civilizations and all helping to promote a feeling of the spiritual and the historical and embolden the narrative, they work really well. Outland also has some of the best title screen narration I've heard in any game.\n\nMistakes and Annoyances\nI expected a lot more frustration and annoyance than I found in this game, and the only things worth complaining about for me were little things that could've been fixed like the option of alternative pre-set control mappings, though even this has been addressed in a recent developer update. I only ran into one bug in my entire 8-hour playthrough which forced me to restart a boss fight. Other than that the only time I ever got frustrated in this game was when I screwed up a platforming section or didn't think through an enemy engagement before charging ahead. These annoyances set to show me I wasn't as good as I thought I was and needed to learn something before proceeding, as many of the good old-school games used to.\n\nRecommendations\nCurrently selling on Steam at £6.99/9.99€/$9.99 and clocking in with an average playtime of 7-8 hours and close to double that for completionists, and with co-op and plenty of replay value, Outland is plain and simple good value for money if it's the genre of game you enjoy. There's even a Two-Pack option where you can save an extra 15-20% if you have someone to go in with.\n\nThere's also a Special Edition at (locally) an extra 33% which includes the soundtrack and an artbook with some development history and plenty of screenshots. While the soundtrack is unarguably good, it's fairly bland and unexciting, and the art is gorgeous, it's still essentially a collection of things in a pdf which are already mostly unlocked in game. In short, the Special Edition is cheap, but doesn't add much value.\n\nUnedited review notes 02/09/2015 for Outland:\n\n+Pretty as hell, the sizes/resolutions are also larger and nicer than usual\n-Map legends/icons and controls are pretty weird and annoying to get used to\n+Awesome narrator, this guy should narrate love books and GPS\n-Game too hard to exit (6 menu selections?)\n+Those boss fights are challenging, interesting, encouraging and always leave me with just 1 heart left\n+Tons of smart little things like attacking hearts 3 times gives you gold instead all add ingenuity","September 4, 2015","true","10.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Interesting mechanics, nice visuals, the music is good (a little repetitive maybe), difficulty is alright, complexity is slowly increasing... very polished. The savepoints could be a little more frequent, but I guess that's due to the world being somewhat open and something I'll get used to.\n\nUpdate: Ok, so after ~10 hours I have almost completed the game, I have yet to beat the final boss. Yes, there are not enough savepoints in the game, and what's even more annoying is that when you exit the game the savepoint is reset and you have to restart the level. Outland is still a very nice game, and I can recommend it, but some parts can be a little frustrating (not enough savepoints).\n\nUpdate 2: Alright. So the boss I had to kill wasn't the final boss. There's apparently one more super boss hiding after three more levels, and those levels are just infuriating.

The artwork is magically rich in detail yet simplistic at the same time, allowing for visual clarity in the gameplay while providing the player with  a sense of wonder at the scene. The story is encapsulating and rich, with little to no lapse in game flow (some people might not like the lengthy levels). The combat may be slightly frustrating at times, but fights only last a few seconds, (with the exception of bosses, those are challenging in a fun way), so it is not a big issue. Most annoying part of the game are the obstacles in each stage; they are quite challenging and may leave you wanting to punch something.\n\nTL;DR - Beautiful environment, very good story, very challenging but fun levels and combat.","June 29, 2015","true","8.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Reason: it takes a while before it really starts to shine.\n\nAt first glance, all I saw were things that were done in other games equally or better. Metroid and castlevania have smoother movements, Dust: an elysian tale and Guacamelee have more fun combat mechanics (Christ...even A shadow's tale has better combat, and that's saying something) and the visuals kinda remind me of Nyx quest but also not as good (and that was just a run-of-the-mill wiiware platformer).\n\nPretty soon, however, you'll get the ability to switch colors between red and blue. And while I originally considered it more of a gimmick than a game mechanic ("why does my random mystic jungle warrior looks like a Tron character?"), it won me over on the amount of uses they'll manage to squeeze out of it. You can only damage enemies of a different color, and projectiles of the same color don't damage you. This gives the combat mechanics an entirely different spin that manages to engage despite being clunky (your character strikes with a 3-hit combo, and pretty soon, enemies will require 4 hits, so you can't charge in).\n\nNot that long after, you'll find uses for all the gold you're collecting (there aren't many places you can buy stuff, but they'll cost you. And there's probably an achievement for collecting the most gold without spending it). And you can choose whether to pick up health or smash it, which'll give you more gold (a dilemma i kind of like).\n\n...and then the game slowly turns into Ikaruga. More and more projectiles are fired, and it's more of a puzzle to get through the place without getting hit by stuff of the opposite color while at the same time crafting a path for yourself in your own color (it's easier than it sounds here, but still pretty challenging).\n\nAt the same time, the story and the lore really take a backseat. IMHO, the game would've been better in a full sci-fi environment rather than this mish-mash of mysticism and futurism. But hey...since the gameplay gets pretty solid, it's not like I'm complaining. And it IS a unique end result. And a very interesting one at the very least. :-)","September 8, 2015","true","7.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I will update the review as needed if I discover something relevant or my views change.\n\nThe controls feel good, the combat is not overly complex but it's entertaining and so far a decent variety of enemies have been introduced. I was curious why this game didn't have a higher rating and read a negative review which stated the controls felt imprecise on keyboard, I can't really confirm or deny this, but with an xbox 360 controller they definitely feel pretty good. Frankly I never liked platformers much in general on keyboard but since I got my controller they've grown on me.\n\nArtstyle is always subjective but personally I really like it. I like the use of contrasting colors and aside from looking good it readily conveys information about the mechanics of the game, as there are different "stances" you can take to interact with different type of objects or enemies of similar or opposite color.\n\nMusic is also a subjective matter, and while what I've heard so far is not overly varied, I like that as well.\n\nThe game has a lot of metroidvania elements and secret walls to discover. I'm not sure how large the overall world is but it is already apparent that some backtracking will be required as you progress in the game in order to discover hidden areas that weren't previously accesible. I personally rather like that.\n\nI'm not sure how deep the story goes, or how much voice acting there is to be found later into the game. So far there's been a bit of voice acting delivering some exposition, and I thought the VA was pretty good. What's been presented of the story so far is nothing mind blowing, but the bits of exposition were interesting and did not overstay their welcome or get too much in the way of the gameplay.\n\nAll in all this seems like a rather great game if you're into action platformers at all, and I aim to play more of it.

The setting takes place in a jungle and puts the player against mythical gods of light and darkness. You eventually gain these light and darkness powers (as well as other platforming abilities) which you can swap between to traverse through obstacles and fight enemy types.\n\nFor me, it really highlights like an older 2D Metroid-esque / Prince of Persia game mashed together pretty well. Of course, instead of shooting, you're using a sword and sliding into enemies.\n\nThe story feels somewhat generic, but I would argue the entire setting is basically "choose your own adventure" in the sense you're filling the hero's shoes, which isn't a bad thing at all since the game-play is quite enjoyable. However, if this is based on an actual mythology (African / South American?), I would love to know!","April 13, 2015","true","2.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I guess not quite, because it's not the best game ever, but still, Outland is pretty damn good.\n\nThe game has quite the variety of different platforming and combat challenges over its pretty decent length (5 main worlds each broken down into a number of sublevels) and I can't really recall anything that felt unfair or unbalanced along the difficulty curve. The platforming and combat both feel fluid and fast-paced enough to be quite enjoyable, and the boss designs are all unique and interesting.\n\nThe game is also one of the best-looking games I've ever seen, fantastic art direction and animations, and the soundtrack's pretty fitting for the game as well, though mildly forgettable. The game's just poetry in motion in that regards, and I had no instances of lagging or frames dropping or anything, it runs well too.\n\nUhh what can I say negative about this. There seems to be a bit of a delay when switching colors, I've had many instances where I got corpse'd by a projectile and I was very visibly the same color as what killed me, which seems a bit borked. The game's also a bit small I guess, but not really, it just feels small because of how quickly it passed by I suppose! Though there seem to be more money vases listed than actually exist, I cannot find the last two and a quick google search showed that I was not alone in this regard. Maybe they were hidden in a boss room somewhere? I dunno.\n\nThere's not much wrong with this game at all though, it doesn't bring anything new to the table but it puts all its elements together in an interesting, unique way to create a very solid platforming experience, definitely check this one out.","January 18, 2015","true","8.2"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

As you progress, you get black on green. Then black on grey. No stylistic differences, not even different enemies or obstacles. Just the same look, which ends up feeling quite bland.\n\n-Controls\nThis is a clear "we don't care about the players" port. The controls for keyboard are nasty. On top of that, the controls aren't very responsive, expecially for a platformer. Tapping a direction results in no movement at all, while holding it for juuust a little second causes the character to sprint a good distance, and then slide to a stop. Getting hit causes you to lose all momentum, which can drop you out of the sky when jumping, and even lead to you getting hit more than once. There's also a mechanic where your character will grab onto a ledge when you get near it. This doesn't happen enough to depend on it, so it either fails you, dumping you off, or it lands you in a long animation, during which you are still vunerable.\n\n-Gameplay\nPresenting itself as a metroid-vania-esque game, Outland is anything but. Progression is entirely linear. Barring collectibles, there's no reason to go back to previous areas. You can't accidentally go into an area and find a dead end you need an ability for. On top of that, the game promises to unlock stuff as you get collectibles. I expected some upgrades, maybe some bonuses or customization options. But no, you get concept art. Every few collectibles. And the "concept art" is indistinguishable from the actual areas it is art from. Kinda lame.\n\n-Combat\nSome platformers can fit combat in well, without interrupting the rest of the platforming. This is not one of those games. For a high-ish speed platformer, it's completely annoying to have to stop moving completely to attack. It's also fairly frustrating to fight the same 4 enemies over and over and over. The fact that the combat pulls you entirely out of the rest of the game is just the icing on the cow pie that is Outland.","July 22, 2015","false","1.2"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gokens/recommended/305050/","gokens","gokens","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gokens/","333 products in account","OverviewThis game had potential, but in the end too many elements simply aren't good enough. Movement feels clumsy, the combat system feels limp, the levels stretch the same content for too long, and both the ability system and the narrative are uninspired.\n\nThe graphical aesthetic is well put together (though it can strain the eyes), but you can see that for yourself in the screenshots.\n\nMovementThe movement system feels awkward and clumsy after playing games like Super Meat Boy and the Super Meat Boy inspired Ori and the Blind Forest. For example when you jump into a wall in SMB you slide up the wall with the vertical momentum you already have; in Outland all momentum disappears when you stick to a wall. It's a tiny detail, but it's the best example of the kinds of details that make Ori and SMB feel so good, and by contrast Outland feels clumsy.\n\nCombatThe combat system is lacking heavily in the "game feel" department: the attacks feel weak. The enemies don't respond when you hit them, the sounds aren't convincing, and there's no camera shake. The only indication that you did any damage at all is a small burst of color radiating out from the enemy.\n\nThe attacks also feel a bit clunky but I actually think this is (or should have been) a good thing. Let me explain. The sparse enemy numbers push the game towards a more tactical slower-paced combat (like Dark Souls nailed). But when the attacks lack that feeling of weight, you can't help but think they should be fluid and smooth (think Devil May Cry[/i]). This is extra painful because the promotional blurb here on steam describes Outland as "fast-paced".\n\nThe end result is that the combat feels unsatisfying. It's a shame, because I think the combat would have been pretty good if Outland had managed to make each hit convey some weight, some indication that you were dealing some serious damage.\n\nLevel DesignThe level design just feels bland, not because there weren't some cool things, but because they're stretched too much.\n\nThe butterflies (waypoints) that show you the way serve the same purpose as the gps system in open world games but it has that same problem: it's far too easy to just zone out and follow your butterfly masters around. This zoning out, unfortunately, greatly harms immersion: there's no chance for each space to feel like a greater part of a whole world.\n\nOn top of butterfly waypoints, the levels drag on for too long. At the beginning of each level I found myself enjoying the new aesthetic, solving new kinds of dilemmas, etc. but somewhere around the half way point I would find myself blindly rushing towards my butterfly masters wondering when they'd finally let me see something different.\n\nThe result is that the levels, while coool at first, end up feeling like a long slog through too few good ideas. Which (like the combat) is a shame because there are good ideas here, and I would have really liked to see a shorter more focused game.\n\nAbility SystemThe ability system is uninspired. Of the 11 abilities, only 3 of them interact with the blue and red lights of this game. The other 8 are your typical overplayed abilities and include everything from melee attack (that's right, that's an ability) to ground stomping. One of them is cool,  but I'm not going to spoil it here.\n\nThe other three abilities allow you to interract with the blue and red orbs of light that are this game's hook. I'm not sure how to avoid spoiling these, because two of them are shown in the trailer. That number is paltry. There are so many cool things that could have been done with this, but instead we have mechanics that are nearly a carbon copy of Ikaruga. Some quick examples: a reflector shield that bounces these orbs of light off you for a short time; or maybe a black hole thing that sucks them in; or maybe the opposite of the black hole that pushes them away; or maybe a something like a Sonic Light Speed Dash through these orbs.\n\nSadly, we don't get any of those\n\nNarrativeTypical hero must prevent the end of the world story. Still, narrative is more than just the sequence of events, it includes the way the story is told, the aesthetic of it all. I still can't tell if I found the presentation endearing or cringe worthy. I don't think it matters. Outland never intended to stand on the strength of its narrative, and the narratives presence in the game is so minimal that it could be terrible and it'd still be unlikely to affect how you feel about the game.\n\nConclusionA lot of people really like this, but I'm going to go play Ori and the Blind Forest again to remember how good these kinds of games can be.","March 26","false","1.0"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/slycooperfan1/recommended/305050/","slycooperfan1","SlyCooperFan1","http://steamcommunity.com/id/slycooperfan1/","307 products in account","I bought this game when it first came out on the PlayStation Network in 2011. It was delayed because of the infamous April 2011 PlayStation hack, but I didn't know about it until the day it released. I played the demo to see what it was about; immediately after finishing the demo, I ran to my dad and begged him to help me buy the game.\n\nOutland is an action platformer implementing a system that lots of gamers seem to have fond memories of whereas Outland is still the first instance of it to me: "color" switching. When you change to red energy, you can absorb red energy from the world and attack blue enemies. Vice versa, when you change to blue energy, you can absorb blue energy and attack red enemies. This comes together in a non-puzzle game to give you some challenges that you'll have to think for a moment about how to solve. That being said, there's nothing challenging about the "puzzles" you come across, and the solution is fairly simple. Easier said than done, as the saying goes!\n\nGameplay: Outland's gameplay is very much based off of this one mechanic. You'll be color-switching a lot. Thankfully, it's done instantaneously through the push of a button, so you'll be back to hack-and-slashing as if nothing happened. Hack-and-slash is very expertly done here, and the color system is often used but never to a point where you get sick of it. It feels completely natural. Jumping and moving around feels fluid, and seems to work better than most other platformers. This is especially so with the wall-jumping, which, as other reviews have stated, works better here than anywhere else. Boss fights are given major importance, and the game does well at making them feel large and epic even when they don't have to be. It works brilliantly.\n\nStory: The story is so intriguing. This is a case of "the story is minimal and doesn't matter much" and "it's good enough to make you want to keep going and enjoy it" at the same time. You play a man who has been experiencing visions of the past due to your spirit being a reincarnation of a hero from 30,000 years ago. You're tasked with the same quest that he was: defeat the Sisters of Chaos who aim to destroy the world that they created. The enemies you meet were once good, but they have been corrupted by Chaos, and you must defeat them to restore balance to the Earth along the way. The only voice actor is the narrator, and while his lines and acting are not as iconic as Bastion's, he gives a solid performance that has stuck with me.\n\nMusic/Sound Design: I want to keep this short and sweet: Buy the Outland - Special Edition pack. I did so as soon as I could. You won't regret owning the soundtrack, composed by Ari Pulkkinen (Super Stardust HD, Trine, Angry Birds, Resogun). The music fits perfectly with the settings they were composed for, and the boss fight tracks have been on loop on my computer since 2011. As for the sound design, it's absolutely solid. That sound when your blade hits an enemy is one of my favorite, and there's a lot of subtle cues like running through the grass, sliding down a wall, that just make this feel like a living world. For an Earth corrupted by Chaos, it still sounds beautiful.\n\nGraphics: And I thought the graphics were beautiful on the PS3! Holy crap! The game looks absolutely gorgeous at 1920x1080. I can't tell you if a game is running at 30fps or 60fps because I really don't care either way, but the game definitely runs smoothly on my computers with no issues.\n\nSummary: For an indie game at $10, you are not going to go wrong here. The replayability is definitely limited, but the experience is one that may stick with you for three years like it has for me. There are few minor issues with the PC port specifically (I don't want to see two control schemes at once), but those absolutely pale in comparison to the rest of the game. I have recommended Outland to all of my friends since 2011, and that has not changed.\n\nEDIT Oct 21 2014: I have now played co-op since writing the review, which works just as well as on the PS3 version. Unfortunately, that also means the game is just as dead, so if you want to play the campaign in full co-op or do the co-op challenges for the achievement, I'd suggest getting a friend.\n\nAdditionally, Housemarque and the devs at Knockout Games who ported Outland to PC are continously updating the game! My review previously mentioned a bug with the intro video glitching out, and this has since been fixed along with other updates such as better GPU handling and smoother co-op experiences.","October 1, 2014","true","12.6"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Combat is just something that is in your way where you slash 1-2-3-4 times an opponent while avoiding whatever goes around you. Sometimes you have to wait around until you are clear to attack. Which is nice the first few times but then it gets annoying.\n\nSome puzzles are well done, constantly switching between light and dark heroes but like most of the things in the game after a while you also get bored of them since you feel you are doing the same puzzle all over again and overcoming the same obstacles.\n\nAnd lastly the "open world" idea of the game, that you can just switch the maps at your will may cause you to get lost if you are not sure what you are doing. Not necesarry a bad point if you carefully follow the game indications but in case you do get lost have fun figuring out where you are supposed to be. The game also takes you again on the same maps you have completed and this can only add even more to the repetitive aspects. After you go several times in the same map, overcoming the same obstacles close to 5-10 times there is hardly anything else left on the fun aspect of the game.\n\nAs for the story, there is close to none in this game.\n\nI had played the game with a XBOX one controller and there is a +1 point there.

I had not recommended this game initially due to the lack of rebindable keys, but the devs have fixed it and so a proper review is in order.\n\nI had heard many great things about Outland, and this game really was on the top of the list of games I wished would come to PC so that I could play it. Overall, after playing it and beating the final boss, I must say it has lived up to expectations.\n\nThe visuals and settings is amazing, there is a good score accompanying the action, and the challenge (especially the boss fights) is well-done. I loved the tight and responsive movement controls...really one of the best-controlling platformers in that respect I've played.\n\nGameplay is composed mainly of platforming, combat and polarity switching, often times combining two or all three of the gameplay mechanics. The regular level sections aren't necessarily difficult. They pose a challenge, and you may die, but compared to the boss fights they are pretty do-able.\n\nAs for the boss fights, they increase in difficulty from one to the other. I found the 4th boss rather difficult, and the final boss is about learning and applying everything you have learned. It is not easy, and took me more than 2 hours to complete the final one. But still I found the challenge fair and kept going at it until I was done. Only 3% have completed the game...so you get an idea.\n\nAlongside all that, there is a decent amount of exploring to do. Some exploring can be done linearly (meaning as you progress), while others are done while backtracking. I did as much linear exploration as I could, and it took me slightly more than 10 hours to complete the game.\n\nAll in all, Outland is as great as I expected it to be. I enjoyed the challenge and setting of the game. As such, naturally the game gets a thumbs up from me.","October 6, 2014","true","12.2"," 22 of 43 people (51%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","51","22","43","2","25"

Comparing to guacamelee this game is very unrewarding all the extra little secret areas give only a few gold pieces which can be used to buy health and stamina. Guacamelee gives a nice progress system towards higher health and stamina. No need to fight the simple enemys running past them is much more effective. Just tank the bullets try to touhou switch but if you miss its probly no big deal. Lots of waiting for moving platforms.\n\nCombat system is much worse than Guacamelees great combat system. This one is basicly just spam attacks sometimes move away. Stamina doesnt auto recharge but the abilitys it allows arent very useful anyways. Monsters cant even find you if you walk off a ledge nearby. Again why even bother to fight them just jump over them and keep running. Most monsters are annoying and uninteresting. Theres this big guy thats like a miniboss that appears 3 times you have to fight. The first time i just held down right and slide attack. The other 2 times he has a really small hit window and it seems random if he hits you back when you attack him. The actual boss fights just seem pretty boring and weird.\n\nMost of the achievments are perfectly managable. One is for doing a coop level and theres no local coop good luck finding a partner online. Last acheivement sucks. Have to spend a few hours grinding gold. I only got like 200k during the game the achievement is for 1m. Dont get the health upgrades it makes it slower and the bosses drop extra hp when your about to die anyways so you dont need it.

Level design is fairly clever. Your character unlocks abilities by visiting different stages in the game world. The game unlocks linearly, but you can revisit old stages whenever and can do so in any order. The game looks like a bullet hell plaformer but it doesn't feel too much more bullet hell than any typical metroidvania platformer. This game is comparable to Mark of the Ninja or Guacamelee. Outside of the color switching mechanic, this plays a lot like them. I do wish the combat was slightly more involved. For instance, I often found myself wishing I had a diagonal downward attack to kill enemies on platforms I'm approaching in midair. There's a rage bar you build up by killing enemies, and you have a few moves that consume that rage. I probably should've used those moves more but they felt more tacked on here (I believe they're color-agnostic abilities).\n\nOverall though, the game is a lot of fun and if you like metroidvanias even a little, I'd recommend this wholeheartedly. 8/10.","November 25, 2015","true","20.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/recommended/305050/","maudish","Audish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/","908 products in account","Outland first appeared on the Xbox Live Arcade, joining similar Metroidvania-ish titles like Shadow Complex (please come to Steam someday) and Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet. It finally made it to PC several years later, finally allowing the PC master race to answer the question "What if Ikaruga was a platformer?" You play a nameless hero of legend who embarks on a quest to stop twin goddesses from blah blah blah I really cannot overstate how generic the story is. The world is coming apart, you need special powers to stop it, you're here to kick ♥♥♥ and chew powerups, and lucky for you there's about 5-6 hours worth of both. Also lucky for you, the platforming that comprises the game is tight, challenging, and fun. Your character moves surprisingly fast, making Outland possibly the only Metroidvania to not feel like it desperately needs better travel powers.

The enemies clearly stand out, have simple and elegant designs, having few uneccessary fetures, which only are there to make the enemy varients more clear, and add to the asthetic involved. The first boss is while not easy, becaome easy after you figure out his patters; to get all the upgrades though there is a coin system, coin farming in entirely uneccesary, but getting every coin pot you can is still recommended. Your character picks up several abilities, the most important (which forever changes you from the gold and black colorscheme) is the polarity mechanic you do not immediatly gain the polarity powers, and only after you gain both can you switch between them, An early flashback gives you an idea of how this works (and will work when you can) to when your appetite. As you go through a number of well drawn, and well desgined stages, you may begin to be very glad you purchased such a well made game. Wexept for a few hiccups mid way through the game, it seems very close to perfect (as far as platfprmers are concened).\n\nBut why would i still not reccomend the game if most of it is so good?\n\nThe final boss you fight is a feathered serpent, which as a lot of build up towards it; each of these guardians was an inportant figure in the rich lore and the featherd serpent seems like it would be a dymanic battle (like many of those previous) and with all your new abilities, it seems like you could have a nice arena, and perhaps some reward for victory that really makes you feel like a legendary hero. The fight starts with three autoscrolling and rather minimalistic platforming sections: go too slow, and you get hit by a death beam, fall off and lose qa heart but get placed in a managable spot; the death beam only deals 1 heart of damage, but also destorys platforms thus eating a second heard and putting you in a tolorable respawn point. Each of these sections has a checkpoint in between. After all that running which helps hyp up the fight, even in the running stages are bland, you get ont a lift, which rises into the air and hang there for a second. The Ser[ent arrives and the battle begins!\n\nbut wait... how do you fight? While it was kind of refreshing to play a game with simple enough controls, and does not feel the need to baby you through everything, i had to look up a guide to figure out how to do any damage; in this fight you spend the entire fight on the beasts back; rendering it's belly mounted death cannons useless and pointless; if an autoscrolling buildup run was necessary, you counld have had the serpend bust through the building with its body, or start the collapse of the temple. Further after a good 15 seconds where no damageable portions are visible, and it has stared raining down polarity colored bombs you will quickly notice your health dropping. Thus is due to the fact that though the bombs are polarity colored, (and suffer damage appropriately)  they deal neutral damage, which means you screen has a dust sand particles moving across the screen, some of which damage you wen some spots on the monster light up. To damage it ou must use the ground stomp; though the raised sections look like you could cut them, and disply the hit animation, unless you stomp, its hitpoint bad does not decrease. After figuring this out, you have to hit the three buttons as the appropriate polatity a few times, and for the latter two the boss starts firring bullets from its fins at the buttons. Unlike the previous two bosses, who despite having basic attack patters, seemed to be fighting you this boss seems to be all but ignoring you as to try to kill it, thetting random debries fight for it. After 3 rounds of button stomping, its head graphic changes a little (it is not easy to see the change due to all the crap onscreen) and becomes damageable by your attacks; and you now need to beat that to death before you run out of hearts. After this monumental battle, the freeroaming aspect of the game is abruptly removed. You go back to the portal, (now unlocked) and are spawned on thedoor, so that as soon as you move you have to start the final set of levels from which there is no return (as far as i could find). In the final levels the goddesses will swap the polarities of all enemies. This would be neat if it was handles better; however, the goddeses have a number of criteria determining when to do the swap (so it seems almost random), they can do it while enemies are mid attack animation (which can result in a swift death), and if that was not annoying enough the aonly warning you get is a screen flash (obscuring everything) which animation begins the instant the color is changed; this means your current attack begun well before the color change may find then enemy innume when it arrives, and already attacking. This turns all of the enjoayable aspects such as fluid mechanics irrelevant. I personally found any enjoment i previously experienced in this title shrivel to ashes with this changes, and as such i would recommoned you spend your money elsewhere.\n\n\nTL/DR\n\nMost of the game is good, but the ending is so bad that i would suggest something else; like Bastion (for fighting) or Bleed (for platforming, and fighting).","August 17, 2015","false","16.1"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/minobear/recommended/305050/","minobear","Alot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/minobear/","171 products in account","If I could summarize this game into a single word it be: cluster♥♥♥♥.\nDid not enjoy this game at all. The game has pretty art, but that's about all it has going for it.\n\nGameplay: The movement feels sluggish at times making the platforming more trouble than it needs to be. Part of it has to do with the momentum you need to build up for some jumps. The game description calls it fast paced, but it's hardly that. It almost seems to punish you for moving too fast. There are countless parts loaded with enemies and orbs that will hurt you and you have to take it slowly or else you'll get hurt. I found myself just running through a lot of the enemies/orbs because they were too tedious to fight/navigate around. Some of the parts even seem like there's no way to get through without getting hurt. Fighting gets boring and frustrating with enemy placement sometimes just there to mess you up or make things more trouble than it needs to be.\nNOW HERE'S MY BIG BEEF. This game sports itself also as a metroidvania style game. You collect powerups, you advance through the world by accessing areas previously unaccassebile thanks to your powerups. Despite this, it could not be any more linear. One thing I love about metroidvania's is the world exploration. This game points a big finger at you and says "walk this way please" and you do becasue there are hardly any alternating paths of interest. At most if you stray from the path you'll find some pots with coins or an upgrade, that's it. Half of the time you spend getting a key to the boss only to backtrack to the boss's door. The upgrades you get aren't even particularly good for helping you advance through the game (aside from maybe one or two). They serve more as means of making combat less frustrating than it already is. You'll get a powerup and than sort of forget about it until you need it because an enemy is just being annoying.\n\nStory: Boring. Generic. I had no connection to the character or the world around me. It has the simple story of you have to save the world from evil. The world had a lot of potential to be interesting, but presented nothing for the player.\n\nArt/Music: Really the only thing the game has going for it, but it's not saying much. I found the environment gorgeous when starting to play, but after an hour or so it all starts to look the same despite it sporting four "unique" environments. And I don't mean the same as in atmosphe and style, I mean it just looks bland and boring.\n\nBosses: At first I rather liked the bosses in this game. The first two you meet are rather enjoyable and interesting to fight. Eventually however, and particularly with the last two bosses, it becomes a simple bullet hell of trying to avoid countless things being thrown at you while trying to hit the same spots to damage the boss. The final boss in particular is just plain awful in design. You are tasked with hitting crystals that circle the area and the ones on the outermost perimeter are near impossible to hit without jumping off and falling into an abyss, only able to save yourself through a jump pad which severely limits your movement, making you more easy to hit.\n\nOverall: The game looks nice for a bit, but it's a linear "metroidvania" with dull combat, non-challenging platforming, and a difficulty made up by the game choosing to throw literally everything at you and saying "good luck dodging this". Definitely would not reccommend this game where I spent half of it wondering when it would be over. Luckily it's only got about six hours of gameplay to the main story.","July 30, 2015","false","5.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It's a pity, considering how nice and atmospheric the game is with the artwork, animations, sounds, music and lighting brilliantly done, but they didn't spend enough time on the most important part: player interaction.\n\nGood points:+ Great sounds that give the a real sense of challenges the game is throwing at you\n+ Great atmospheric music (very high quality and sounds great on a good sound system)\n+ Love the artwork\n+ Excellent animations\n+ Great particle effects\n+ Immersive lighting\n+ Solid responsive controls that work really well when navigating levels and do their best with the limited combat system\n+ Being able to grab ledges and pull yourself up onto platforms is a big win. This is something I found infinitely frustrating in Guacamelee and I'm glad this isn't a problem in Outland!\n\n\n\nBad points:- Touching enemies does damage and gives knockback. This is a TERRIBLE design decision and makes the lacklustre combat system even more tedious\n- The combat system is lacklustre, with only a few basic moves and no real combos\n- As you progress further into the game changing between light and dark is CONSTANT throughout ALL later levels. This should be limited to a few challenging sections on each level, especially because when combined with the lacklustre combat system, a limited variety of enemies and a limited variety of traps and projectiles this makes the game progress excessively tedious.\n- Stamina should auto-regenerate and health should get small bumps from slain enemies. This would have lead to a more effective combat system as more stamina moves could have been incorporated\n- No dodge\n- I can see an assignment for a shield (which I haven't come accross yet) and I believe this should come earlier in the game because there are enemies which I can't stun and need to block, but can't. With no dodge mechanic and no real fluidity to the combat system, I end up having to take unnecessary damage and this is frustrating\n\n\n- There isn't really a diverse array of traps and projectiles in the game. There are only spikes, beams and light ball projectiles\n- Certain sections of the game don't have the combinations of platforms and projectiles very well timed, so predicting a pattern for navigating these sections becomes a game of luck more than skill\n- The knockback from taking hits is much more debilitating than it needs to be. It disrupts game flow too much, especially when touching enemies causes knockback, so often when you try to fight a clustre of enemies, if you make one mistake, you end up just getting knocked around until you die. Once again this might not have been so bad if I could recover through the use of an effective combat system.\n- Not much of a variety of loot in the secret areas. It's either health or coins, but no character bonuses\n- Check points are erroneously spaced\n- Restarting the game DOES NOT take you back to your most recent checkpoint, but back to the beginning of the level you're on. This is also a really stupidly annoying design decision! It probably wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't for the tedious level progress\n\n- Changed options don't stick from previous game launches. Every time I launch the game, I have to turn Rumble off\n\n- Not much of a storyline","January 13","false","5.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It finally made it to PC several years later, finally allowing the PC master race to answer the question "What if Ikaruga was a platformer?" You play a nameless hero of legend who embarks on a quest to stop twin goddesses from blah blah blah I really cannot overstate how generic the story is. The world is coming apart, you need special powers to stop it, you're here to kick ♥♥♥ and chew powerups, and lucky for you there's about 5-6 hours worth of both. Also lucky for you, the platforming that comprises the game is tight, challenging, and fun. Your character moves surprisingly fast, making Outland possibly the only Metroidvania to not feel like it desperately needs better travel powers. You turn on a dime, wall jumping is swift and forgiving on timing, and combat is meaty and flows well.

It is one of the rare platformers that manages to be challenging but in a comfortable way, not with loads of BS and what not. It is a complete joy to play and is a rare time that I have almost no negatives to point out about a game. After I started this for the first time I sat and played it for two hours straight. The last entire hour I had to pee but I kept saying "after the next checkpoint" at least a dozen times. It is super fun and addicting and it has what a lot of these indie platformers purposely leave out to artificially increase a game's difficulty: tight controls. A example of a game with awful loose slippery controls like you are sliding on ice would be Super House of Ice Skating Ninjas. The controls here are for the most part very tight. The jumping takes a little time to get used to, but pretty much not more than ten minutes or so. The difficulty comes from the level hazards that shoot out waves of blue and red balls, forcing you to switch your attunement accordingly. So far it has been pretty challenging but fair, my deaths coming from my error only. Another problem with a lot of bad platformers is bad checkpointing. Here, checkpoints are well placed. The combat is fluid, the sounds are great, the ambient background music is nice, and the gameplay is all around a lot of fun. Being able to bust up a green heart for coins instead of grabbing it for health is a great sense of accomplishment since it is not easy to stay at full health or even close to it. I usually stay at half hearts on average. As far as MP goes, you will not find anyone online for a co-op unless you play with a friend or ask for a partner in the forums. The graphics are superb, especially the multi-layered backgrounds. Very impressive. I wouldn't consider this a metroid-type because you just clear a area and move on. Any backtracking you do is swift and it gets you to another newly reachable area without too much delay. The map system doesn't look like a metroid map which is the point at which I would say that it isn't quite a metroid type. It is fast-paced, has a good flow, and looks great. As far as length goes it is about 6-8 hours long. One of my more favorite platformers that I have played in a while. $2.50 was a pretty good deal.\n\n8/10","April 13, 2015","true","9.0"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","44","4","9","2","0"

Metroidvanias being one of my favourite genre, I've finally decided to give it a try.\n\nAlthough it is a good game, overall, it was rather disappointing, to me. Mostly because of the metroivania aspect. It's... completely unremarkable. The game is incredibly linear, with almost to no backtracking. The powers you get aren't very interesting either, and simply act as a way of gating progress.\nThere are some hidden collectibles and upgrades to your Health and Special Attacks (Fury) bar, but not much is really done with the metroidvania aspects.\n\nFor example, there are a couple of collectibles and upgrades that require backtracking after you get certain abilities. The problem is that the game never gets you to backtrack. The game itself is linear, so you have to make an effort to go back.\nYou're never lost or just wandering about the areas for your own exploration. The game simply pushes you forward until the very end.\n\nIt's not interesting. The metroidvania seems a mere label on top of the game, and something that was never explored.\n\nSo yeah, this was disappointing.\n\nHowever, it's still a pretty good game!\nThe Prince of Persia-esque movement felt surprisingly satisfying! While a bit weird at first, because of how physics-driven it is, it gets much better when you get the hang of it!\n\nThe art-style is also great, although a bit too repetitive. Colors and the backgrounds change a bit to provide enough variety, but the striking aspect (the sillhouette) does make it somewhat monotonous.\nIt still looked really good, for the most part!\n\nThe music was also great at setting an ambience, although it didn't go much further than that, for me.\n\nI'd rather keep this one short. The game seemed a bit unremarkable, for me. But it does have its great aspects, and it's worth playing if this style of platforming seems to appeal you. And both the art and sound design are far above average, which helps!","October 3, 2015","true","10.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

You switch your alignment from light/blue to dark/red at the press of a button. In red mode, red projectiles or energy beams can't hurt you, only blue ones, whereas you can only deal damage to blue enemies, and vice versa in blue mode. Once you have multiple projectile sources and enemies of different color (or even switching colors in intervals) on a screen, things start to get tough, but never frustrating.\nOne thing this game is missing is a proper story. Every now and then you get some text, but nothing exactly groundbreaking. The focus of this game is definitely art and gameplay.\nI played the game originally on PS3 a few years ago, now again on Steam (finally). You can finish it in around 8 hours. You can then search for all the collectibles and try Arcade mode or some special Online Coop challenges. I'd say you can easily get another 8 hours out of this (or depending on how far you want to get on the leaderboards even more).\n\nConclusion: Great game, great controls, great art style. Story irrelevant.

The artwork and character designs are really nice and the main reason for me to keep coming back at this game. Storywise there's not a lot going on, but it's presented in a nice way anyway. The meat of the game is at the level design and mechanics.\n\nThe levels can be hard as nails at times, but never are they impossible. If you die a lot it's your own fault, so count to ten and try again. I haven't felt the need to throw my controller against the wall as yet, but I can't promise that won't change for the rest of the game. And still it is fun. There are multiple ways of using your color shift and other abilities to make your way, which give a sense of freedom and satisfaction once you manage to get through.\nThe way the map works reminds me of the mazelike map Knytt uses but more lineair; you won't get lost as long as you follow the guide (but feel free to digress or come back at an earlier point to get some bonus loot).\n\nYes, I recommend this game, either on sale or at full price.

This game has a really good design, the visuals backed up with smooth music create a unique atmosphere, which improves the game experience a lot.\n\nsecond, the gameplay mechanics are also well designed. the use of the light and dark alignment is the key not just fighting enemies, but getting around the map too - platforms, blocks and spikes can appear/disappear depending on your colour.\n\nas you progress hrough levels, you unlock variuos skills/speial attacks, and different enemies appear, so the game doesn't get repetitive.\n\nthe coop feels like a totally different game. you can use different alignments to make all platforms appear and fight all enemies at the same time. however, when you have to switch alignments rapidly, your coordination must be on point to get through some areas.\n\nalso there are the coop challenges, which require really good communication. best (and also the most fun) is when you play local coop, or at least speak through voice chat\n\ni have to note, however, that i find it a little annoying, that in coop mode you collect the money and the marks differently. since the achievements which involve the marks are tied to single player, this is not that big issue, but at some points you'll face the situation, that one player has the money for an upgrade, while the other doesn't. And in general, the amount of loot and enemies is the same, while you need twice as much to unlock everything. This might be because the coop is already easier, and on top of that you can revive your ally when he loses his last health\n\n\nTL,DR: good game, do yourself a favor, and buy it!","March 7, 2015","true","31.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The demo didn't do much for me at the time, and I just basically filed this game under the forgettable category.  Fast forward to present day, and I decided to pick this game up during the last Steam sale.  Seeing as how this game has gotten mostly positive and favorable reviews, I decided, well, let's give this game another shot.  Sometimes, a demo doesn't tell the whole story, and this is exactly what has happened with this game.\n\nAfter just now beating the final boss, wow, wow, wow is all I can say (and I said that a lot while playing this game)!  I am blown away by the sheer quality of this $10 game.  For the money, this absolutely blows aways many $60 games I've played.  I've played Housemarque's other games (Resogun, Super Stardust, and Dead Nation) and this is BY FAR, their best game, hands down.\n\nThis is a very interesting take on a platformer and it's done extremely well.  If you like Ikaruga and 2d action platformers, you'll absolutely love this game.  Do not hesitate to buy it!   The excellent gameplay, along with the game's outstanding artwork/graphics, excellent music, and ABSOLUTELY AMAZING BOSS BATTLES really propel this to be something special.  The boss encounters are truly special and really make the game stand out.  It's really a shame this game doesn't have more recognition than it has, as it seems like nobody knows about this game.\n\n","March 1, 2015","true","18.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

What I missed though was an urge for exploring the places where you couldn't access before player acquires new skills. Looking forward to check out the co-op challenges, although they are only available online. Add some interesting rewards for keeping the exploration interesting and couch co-op, and things would look good for the next game.

It has an explorable world to a degree, where you can run around and fight enemies, and go to older areas to get collectibles when you have newer abilities, though beyond getting collectibles that unlock concept art, and plot related reasons, there's no reason to go back.\n\nYou can change between Blue and Red with a button. Being Blue will let you use Blue Items and protect you from blue attacks/bullets. and vice-versa for Red. There various platforming and puzzle elements that interact with your color changing are all really fun, and there's a sense of accomplishment when you do it flawlessly.\n\nJust to note, you don't start with the color changing ability, but get one color at a time. It doesn't take too long to get them though, so be patient.\n\nThere's plenty of combat with a variety of enemies, and there's a good number of abilities/techniques too.

The enemies are in fact well designed, each with its own weaknesses and strong points, buy you have such a large amount of tools to deal with them that if you dont feel like dealing with them you can just hadoukem them to death. Some are resistent to hadoukening, but ignoring them is also a thing, since there seems to be a lot of money on the game, never run out at the games upgrades.\n\nThe best part are the bosses. They are very well designed. This is the real challenge.\n\nAnyway the game is very forgettable, but fun anyway. Its a rare kind of game, that game that is just good enough for me to keep playing, the very exact mediocreness to keep me playing to the end, the exact kind of 6 of 10. Its a jewel of the every day. Its like cleaning the dishes after a good meal.\n\nRecommended!","August 9, 2015","true","10.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vortiene/recommended/305050/","Vortiene","Vortiene","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vortiene/","165 products in account","So this game is great. Metroidvania style gameplay with some bullet hell elements. Melee combat with a single beam attack and an AOE aura attack you both get later on (mana-based attacks). You can switch from red (dark) to blue (light) modes, which allow you to absorb bullets of the same color, while also allowing you to damage enemies of the opposite color. This makes for some interesting color-switching gameplay.\n\nPluses:\nThe game has very beautiful concept-art-ish backgrounds. A lot of blacks, but the game doesn't seem overly dark since it is colored with red and blue everywhere. You'll visit a jungle, an underworld cave area, an ancient city, and other such cool places.\n\nCombat is quite fluid, movement feels responsive. Not very restrictive. Not hugely combo-based but you can fly through enemies gracefully once you get the controls down. Speaking of controls, you probably should play with a controller here. It's not designed originally for keyboards as a console title.\n\nThere isn't much downtime in the game, you move straight to the next portion without any interruption. Collecting everything is enjoyable, and usually rewarding.\n\nMusic is subdued but well done. You probably won't be able to hum the OST after playing this game in full, but the music isn't out of place or jarring.\n\nThe visuals are stylized enough that they will never look dated. Very nice.\n\nBosses are the most enjoyable portion of the game. Only the last boss is an exception.\n\nGame has a reasonable amount of difficulty. It's challenging, but not ridiculous. No frustrating parts.\n\n\nMinuses:\n\nIt feels like this game could have used a dodge mechanic. It plays fine without one, but would have been so much more fluid with one.\n\nPlatforming and bullet-avoidance is more the focus in the game. Combat seems to be sidelined outside of bosses, which is okay, and I think it works, but is a bit dissappointing.\n\nThe last boss is underwhelming, and its difficulty is entirely placed on the few awkwardnesses the controls have. For example, you can't easily attack below you in the air without having to do a "ground pound"-esque attack which plummets you off the level, which is one of the only reasons the last boss becomes difficult.\n\nThe powerups you receive in the game aren't useless for the most part, but the latter ones seem like they aren't better than what you already have, and are just there to enable you to reach the next area. They are supposed to be additions to your combat capabilities, but some of are mostly relegated to traversal techniques rather than combo-additives.\n\nThe story is pretty half-baked. I understand the game is supposed to be minimally invasive and have almost no interruptions from the experience. This is good, but I think a game needs to have some backstory if it's going to have a story at all. For example, there's unlockable art pieces. Just have the game's background lore in text form unlocked the same way. This means people wishing to learn more about the game's story can check it out. Otherwise it seems like no effort was put into the story.\n\n\nIn the end, this game is great for the gameplay and relatively good artistic style. For fans of metroidvania games, this is 8-12 hours well spent.\n\nNote: Two of the achievements are a pain. One requires a co-op level to be completed, which is reliant on the game having an active community, which it won't, since it's a linear single-player game in its core. The other requires the collection of 1000000 doubloons, which requires around 1.5 hours of grinding minimum after collecting everything in the game. I don't think that's good design, to require grinding aimlessly to receive one of the achievements. To be clear, there's no way you could get 1000000 doubloons without at least a bit of grinding.","September 10, 2015","true","11.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It has an explorable world to a degree, where you can run around and fight enemies, and go to older areas to get collectibles when you have newer abilities, though beyond getting collectibles that unlock concept art, and plot related reasons, there's no reason to go back.\n\nYou can change between Blue and Red with a button. Being Blue will let you use Blue Items and protect you from blue attacks/bullets. and vice-versa for Red. There various platforming and puzzle elements that interact with your color changing are all really fun, and there's a sense of accomplishment when you do it flawlessly.\n\nJust to note, you don't start with the color changing ability, but get one color at a time. It doesn't take too long to get them though, so be patient.\n\nThere's plenty of combat with a variety of enemies, and there's a good number of abilities/techniques too. I definitely recommend this to any Metroidvania or puzzle/action/platformer fans. Especially for the $10 price, though of course getting it on sale is always nice.","August 8, 2015","true","3.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The platforming is pretty good.  The combat with the light/dark switch makes for some clever scenarios.  The challenge was decent.\n\nYou could argue that it isn't much of a metroidvania.  It does have the standard large map with many areas.  exploration is fairly minimal as the game tells exactly where to go at all times.  It does still require to get new moves to progress into new areas.\n\nThe graphics are great.  The controls are very responsive (on par with a Megaman X, minus a bit of walking slide like Mario, and the wall slide could be a bit better).  I think there must be something up with drivers or something for those who complained about controls being unresponsive.  I never noticed anything like this, and I am one for very tight controls.  The level design is great.\n\nThis will be a game I return to regularly.  Considering that I got it on sale for $2, it was an amazing buy.  Replay could be helped with difficulty settings.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/evilTak/recommended/305050/","evilTak","Tak!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/evilTak/","234 products in account","Outland is a sort of guided, primitive-themed, 2d metroidvania.\n\nThe player controls a hero who is possessed by the spirits of past heroes, in a not-really-that-clear quest to save the world somehow, or something. He approaches this by navigating a series of geographically contiguous areas, defeating the bosses of each, and utilizing the abilities reaped to make his way to the previously inaccessible next area, finally having a showdown with some celestial dragon goddess sisters.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, Outland really reminds me of Guacamelee, and that's a good thing. The main game mechanic is the interplay of dark and light. The hero is (eventually) invested with both dark and light spirits - which one is currently embodied determines which enemies the hero can damage, which attacks can damage the hero, and how the hero interacts with various environmental elements (platforms, spikes, etc.). The areas are carefully constructed to take advantage of this, often forcing the hero to choose between dodging energy "bullets" or jumping over spikes, to switch spirits in midair, and so on.\n\nThe art style is very polished and consistent. The bright, active backgrounds in some areas can be extremely distracting, but it feels like the designers made this choice intentionally to put pressure on the player's focus and concentration.\n\nAccording to Steam, it took me about 6.5 hours to complete the main singleplayer campaign (at least 2 hours of that must have been boss fights), with maybe ⅔ of the optional secrets discovered.\n\nI played through on Ubuntu 15.04. Performance was good, my dualshock3 gamepad was perfectly supported, and I didn't encounter any crashes or other problems.","September 17, 2015","true","6.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's addictive and fun!\n\nMy one gripe with it is the controls. It is full keyboard, no mouse involved other than menu navigation. It uses the J,K,L,I and M keys for actions along with WASD. This can be uncomfortable at first, but it's easily adapted to after a few levels. The real problem with it comes in CTRL. Right CTRL. This is an awful choice because it causes you to overstretch just to reach a key you need for quick actions.\n\nThat's it. One (To my knowledge) non-keybindable control.\n\nThat's literally it.\n\nDownload this now\n\n*EDIT* After putting more time into the game, I've come to realize how much of a problem the CTRL key is. There are integral parts of the game that require you to press WASD, I, and CTRL all at once, which is extremely uncomfortable.","October 2, 2015","true","9.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

To view the review and other articles, please visit our website: http://randomselecttv.com/impression-outland/\n\nPlatformers are fun, and so is exploration. Both of those go together like peanut butter and jelly. Outland is no exception. Developed my Housemarque, Outland originally was released for Xbox Live Arcade and the PlayStation Network back in 2011, but the game is just now making its way to PC. Now before going any further, it is crucial to point out that while it’s published by Ubisoft on the Xbox 360, Housemarque is self-publishing on Steam and as a result Uplay is nowhere to be seen.\n\nStory\n\nThe game starts with the nameless hero having strange dreams and visions of the past. Thinking it may be illness, the hero turns to medicine which proves to be ineffective. He turns to a shaman who told him stories of a huge battle that took place 30,000 years ago between a Great Hero and Two sisters of Chaos, who control Light from the sun and the other controls the darkness of the moon. The battle imprisoned the sisters, but it also took the life of the Great Hero. The shamantells him how the hero is the reincarnation of that Great Hero, and only he can stop the event from reoccurring.\n\nPlayability\n\nThe player controls a nameless hero throughout numerous stages and areas. Completing these areas involves running through the level once to hit a level or switch followed by navigating back through the level to advance, but that makes it sound simple. I can assure you that you will be in for a surprise. Outland is difficult and sometimes infuriating. While the first area may seem easy to begin with, difficulty increases the further you progress. Oh but it’s not just using melee attacks to kill the various enemies and endless amount of spiders, Outland quickly throws you in to the Bullet-Hell and puzzle genres. One of Outlands key features is the ability to switch colors, or ‘spirits’ as they are referred to.\n\nSwitching from red to blue is crucial to navigating your way through the beautifully designed levels. You will find yourself wondering “how?” several times throughout the game. Rapid spirit switching, wall jumps, slides, the works. It is a tough game. Enemies will kill you, opposite spirit projectiles will kill you, and spiders WILL kill you. Outland is tough, but it is very fun. Now we should probably talk about how the game actually runs. It’s safe to say the port is a very good one. I’ve had a few issues where the game crashes after tabbing out for a short period, but so far that has been a very rare occurrence. Since the game originally released on consoles, using a controller is recommended here. The keyboard controls feel very cramped for the many abilities you can unlock.\n\nAll the keys are just grouped together in a very non user friendly way, sadly those keys cannot be rebound outside of switching to the only other layout, which isn’t much better. Control issues aside, performance is very good. It’s a 2D Platformer so most anything will be able to run the game. I haven’t noticed any major issues outside of some very rare tiny glitches, for the most part though the game performs and feels fantastic.\n\nVisuals\n\nSimply put, the game is gorgeous. Amazing backgrounds mix so well with the contrasting Blue and Red spirit colors. Outland presents itself perfectly. The moment you start playing the game, you can see all of the artistic talent that went into the game. 2D Platformers tend to always have a very unique art style, and Outland is just another example of that. The silhouette of the player and the various enemies is reminiscent of Limbo, but are highlighted by vivid shades of Red and Blue, and occasionally yellow.\n\nFeatures\n\nSingleplayer: Campaign Only, Metroidvania Style Story.\nCo-Op: Campaign Modified Co-Op, Arcade Style Challenges, Co-Op Challenge Rooms\nSteam Achievements: Specialized Tasks Awarding Honor Stamps\nSteam Cloud: Ability To Back Up & Load Saves From The Cloud\nFull Controller Support: Full Controller Support for Xinput Enabled Devices.\nSteam Trading Cards: Tradable & Marketable Digital Cards Related To Medium Awarded Base On Playtime.\n\nSoundscape\n\nOutlands scores are composed by Ari Pulkkinen who is known for such games as the Trine franchise and most recently Resogun. As well as composing the scores, he also contributed to the general sound design. The game sounds good, sword slashes provide a satisfying sense of contact when you attack an enemy and everything else mixes perfectly with the setting to help immerse the player into the game.\n\nMultiplayer\n\nThe multiplayer component of the game becomes more and more fleshed out as you go farther in the single campaign. There are certain elements that unlock as you encounter them throughout the game, the first of these modes is to do the campaign cooperatively, the changes from single player are mostly to switches or any specific advancement article is made to be needed to be activated by both parties. You are given complete free roam from your partner and not required to stay on screen, this helps with exploration as you cover more ground. The only gripe about the multiplayer was that it has this rubber banding issue where the game kept trying to sync what we both would be doing constantly. This led to some lag as it always appeared that animations were a frame or so behind then correct before going behind again.\n\nParting Shot\n\nOutland is a fun game. Exploration feels fun and it feels good when you are rewarded for going off the beaten path. The music and sound ties perfectly with the gorgeous stages and background to create some very nice eye and ear candy. Combat plays a key role in the game. You have a basic melee attack as well as unlockable abilities such as the slide. Combos are very possible, and probably the most satisfying element of the combat system. A simple slide will throw the enemy in the air allowing you to set up for juggle combos that feel straight out Street Fighter or Marvel vs Capcom. Unfortunately, that novelty wears off fairly quickly.\n\nOnce you figure out the best combos to use, combat feels more like a routine and a choir, then something you might look forward too. Where the combat fails, the exploration makes up for those shortcomings. Wall jumping and spirit switching around the stages can be rewarding. It’s not always best to follow the straight and narrow, you are rewarded for exploring. Whether you find some of the 40+ collectable masks which can be used for unlocking concept art or upgrading abilities, or finding a totem which allows you to pay your collect coins for a very helpful health upgrade.\n\nCombat becomes repetitive and feels like a choir that sometimes can be avoided, with the exception of boss battle which honestly are fun. The game shines in its tough and thought provoking puzzles and landscapes. Feeling that great relief once you get past that one puzzle you finally beat is something that some games today fail to even provide, but Outland does. I feel good about recommending Outland. Only being held back by the games length and the dull combat, Outland proves to be a very fun and satisfying mix of Metroidvania and Puzzle games.","September 30, 2014","true","3.5"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

Gameplay is fun and highly responsive. It has a strong metroidvania layer into its gameplay.

Asking someone to describe this game is like asking for a description of a clear blue sky: nothing stands out in the experience. Gameplay, aesthetics and narrative barely fit together. I'd rather they worked on one feature that represented the game.\n\nThe game is terribly disappointing coming from Ubisoft; and for some reason Price of Persia symbols have been placed directly into the game with no sensible reason whatsoever.

I left after half an hour because the controls are just too sloppy for this kind of game. It's worth clarifying that I have no complaint about the controller support/keyboard.\n\nWhat is sloppy is the raw implementation. He's sluggish to respond to input - I can't quantify by how much, but it's crippling to a game of this nature. I press change color, and it happens perceptibly after I press the button. I'm sure I could learn to play with that, but it doesn't feel good. Secondly, the character has inappropriate acceleration and speed for the level design. He will frequently overshoot, undershoot and just generally jump to just the wrong height. It's possible to get used to no doubt, but for this kind of game it simply isn't fun. And that acceleration... wow. He won't move for almost as long as there is input lag, so you frequently accelerate for too long/not long enough. Argh. Finally, the levels are scattered with ledges which look in reach that aren't quite, jumps that look doable but aren't, and so on.\n\nBriefly touching on other stuff, the art was occasionally interesting but for the most part bland, making poor use of silhouettes. The story concept was a non-starter for me. The music was lovely, but it's not enough to redeem it for me.\n\nIf the controller was overhauled, I might recommend this. That's never going to happen, so it's a thumbs down from me.","April 24, 2015","false","0.5"," 4 of 13 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","4","13","0","0"

The levels designes and enemies are repetitive. Lazy lazy lazy....  They don't mix it up enough to keep it interesting and a few hours into the game it just becomes a painful chore to play. They just took the same levels, enemies and visuals and gameplay and cut and paste them across an endless ligne up of rooms that don't really seem different from one another. I got through 20 of them but then I said to myself, I have 50 other games in my library that are actually enjoyable, I'm over this.\n\nI usually avoid Ubisoft games because Ubisoft Montreal represents everything I don't want to $$$ support in a game studio, an intense amount of talent and potential in the lower echelons who pour their hearts and souls into the game and completly idiotic MBA grads on the top who try to be clever with the $$$$ and just mess the whole game up: ASSasin's CREED DISUNITY -  need I say more.

It's a shame this game is so awful due to its broken controls. The controls are so bad that playing Outland you think your playing an unbalanced beta. Let me explain this in more detail:\n-you accelerate and decelerate quite slowly\n-your maximum walking speed is rather high\n-the movement of the character seems a bit delayed\n-not jumping to maximum height is possible, but very fiddly\n-the character grabs edges automatically, but it is very diffucult to anticipate if this happens\n-switching between light and dark is very delayed\nSo you have a high speed platformer with delayed and sloppy controls. Good luck wih that...\nBesides the controls there are also some other negative things:\n-the graphics are very dull, everthing is just dark-blackish\n-in to many places you can just rush through, relying on the fact that you are invulnerable for a short time after a hit\n-there are to many parts where you have to observe a pattern or just wait for the enemy to do the "right" thing. Sometimes this game really asks for you patience and personally I thing that patience and platforming is a horrible combination.\n-Your health isn't refilled at checkpoints, but after resetted to a checkpoint you have full health. So the game forces you to commit suicide. It's a small detail but it shows how unpolished this game is.","March 5, 2015","false","12.9"," 12 of 30 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","12","30","0","0"

Regardless of the recommendation I give, Do not buy this game unless you have a xbox controller.\n\nNow on to the main review:\n\nThis is a game I bought near the end of 2015 but due to lacking a xbox controller until last summer and a large pile up of games on my todo list piling up as my wishlist got emptied I couldn't really test out the game until january 2016. What I have discovered is a game with good gameplay, great music, and fantastic graphics. The gameplay is that of a pseudo-metroidvania, where you get upgrades as you go along unlocking various upgrades which you use with various binds on the xbox controller rather than a selection system (this is why you can't play this game without a xbox controller). The game lacks a coherent map structure, but luckily the game guides you along the path you are supposed to take and you can stopto explore secrets and such on your path. The pricing is good, and the story is somewhat engaging and reminiscent of samurai jack.\n\nI recommend this game for the following:\n- all fans of metroidvanias who have a xbox controller\n- all fans of platformers who have a xbox controller\n- all fans of samurai jack who have a xbox controller\n- Anyone who knows what zs_outland is","January 15","true","7.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","4"

First problem is the art-style, which is very nice and different at first, but simply doesn't evolve at all later on: if you show me a pic of a random area from the game, it'd be hard for me to say to which main area it belongs to. That's a problem for the backtracking part of the game: you have a new power yet you have no clue where are the places you have to use it in; probably the developers noticed too, that's why they created detailed maps and a guiding light that you just have to constantly follow, wich defeats the whole purpose of the Metroidvania stuff. As for the dual powers mechanic, it's severely underdeveloped, it basically revolves around the game throwing growingly complex projectiles patterns at you, there's no health absorption from your color's projectiles and no other relevant use of the mechanic. The combat is pretty basic and clunky as well, but it gets a few more options down the road. All in all, it's an average game through the end, lacking any surprises.","January 30","false","12.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Moving through the levels feels satisfying, especially once you get into that jump n' run flow. In that area I'd compare it to something like Rayman: Legends. Of course the gorgeous visuals help the game a lot,  making each level feel vibrant and distinct. The sound design is also well-done, same as the boss design. Even though I had to retry some of them quite often, it felt really great to defeat them, because I never felt bogged down or beaten unfairly.","January 19","true","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It tells the story of a mythical hero, mostly alone on a journey of self-discovery. It's a familiar narrative presented in a refreshing way. Much like the hero in this story, you'll find yourself spellbound somewhere between a dream and reality.\n\nSimply put, Outland is an action-packed platformer half Prince of Persia and half Avatar: The Last Airbender. To describe it thus sells it short, and if you are familiar with either of the previously mentioned source materials you understand the gravitas of that statement. Outland is so enchanting in presentation and story that you will forgive any repetitive gameplay.\n\nIf Outland was to be described in two words they would be colourful and luminescent. Outland sports detailed sprites, richly painted in spectacularly vibrant colours. The shadowy background, equally well drawn, contrast the foreground environment with a darker pallet. Bright effects dot the landscape completing the compelling and visually splendid world of Outland.\n\nIn many similarly priced games, bright visuals would be enough of a selling point. Where Outland shines above and beyond its competition is with its story. To delve too deeply into the narrative would spoil the adventure. In broad strokes, Outland's world is one of competing forces: light and dark. You play the hero who, in time, overcomes his insecurities to wield both of these forces. Though this recounting seems bland you will have to take it on faith that the mythology of the land and their visual representation will have you grant you escapism in the most gorgeous fashion.\n\nOutland's one flaw, if it has one, would be the gameplay. The controls on the keyboard are slightly awkward in the placement. Furthermore, as is the curse of many platformers, mission begin to stagnate, due to repetitive mechanics. Thankfully, Outland does an excellent job of introducing new skills and challenges at a perfect pace to keep you dreaming in their wonderful world.","July 27, 2015","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I did find some of the level repeative but that happens to most platforms but if you enjoy platforms you will love this game for sure. I did find that you could skip a lot of the harder obstacles by taking the hits and getting to the next check point then getting full health by dying. My biggest problem really was the up-stun attack, as it stun locked most mobs... none these are reason to skip the game as its just me being a critic and i highly recommend getting this game as the switching is a lot of fun and some of the best made boss fights i've ever experienced ( and i count raiding vanilla WOW when bosses could take up to a hour with 40 people  ).","April 6","true","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are challenging areas, but I never reached rage-quit. You can buy health/energy upgrades with your coins and there are Marks of the Gods and money pots to collect for the completionists. After you get about 30 Marks of the Gods you unlock a treasure map, which helps get the money pots you missed. You still have to find the remaining marks on your own though.\n\nThe last bosses are tough. It took me at least a dozen tries, it can be a frustrating battle because with one slip you can really screw your chances and it's a long battle. It was very satisfying to finally succeed and get the achievement.\n\nOverall the achievements are okay mix, some are completionist, some are random weird tasks and some are for co-op/arcade. The rarest achievement is 1 million coins. For those who are curious, I had 700k coins at the end of my run.","January 8","true","18.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

First problem is the art-style, which is very nice and different at first, but simply doesn't evolve at all later on: if you show me a pic of a random area from the game, it'd be hard for me to say to which main area it belongs to. That's a problem for the backtracking part of the game: you have a new power yet you have no clue where are the places you have to use it in; probably the developers noticed too, that's why they created detailed maps and a guiding light that you just have to constantly follow, wich defeats the whole purpose of the Metroidvania stuff. As for the dual powers mechanic, it's severely underdeveloped, it basically revolves around the game throwing growingly complex projectiles patterns at you, there's no health absorption from your color's projectiles and no other relevant use of the mechanic. The combat is pretty basic and clunky as well, but it gets a few more options down the road. All in all, it's an average game through the end, lacking any surprises.","January 30","false","12.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is difficult and gets harder as more elements are introduced, like colored platforms, which you must be the matching color to land on, often while opposite color bullets are being sprayed in your direction. controller is not needed, but is recommended because of how precise the platforming tends to be\n","May 31","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
