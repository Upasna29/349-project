"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ejbspeed/recommended/33620/","ejbspeed","Pywackett-Barchetta","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ejbspeed/","340 products in account","Have you ever picked up a game from a bargain bin, back in the days before Steam sales, just on a whim? Out of a little pool of obscure titles, picking up one you've never heard of, and giving it a shot just because you can, and it's cheap. And sometimes, it'd be mediocre, or broken. But sometimes, you'd end up with an awesome experience that you'd never have come across otherwise. This game, in my opinion, is the latter case.\n\nIt's a budget title, sure. That shows through in quite a few occasions, be it skyscrapers abruptly appearing with a low draw distance, or the hard-to-place voice acting. But as far as outright fun goes, the game only spends the first half pretending at all that the story is anything but an excuse to put you in increasingly preposterous vehicles and doing awesome things.\n\nMany game mechanics are introduced, and some instructions seem to be outright missing from the game (when tailing someone in the open world, for example, you must destroy their car when the timer runs out, despite no hint that you should do so unless you fail to). But overall, this is an arcade racer at the very core of it. Some control issues (those of you using 360 controllers must use the D-Pad to scroll through menus), poor design choices (you must go back to the menus to go back into the open world when you've finished a mission) and strange missions (collecting tickets from cameras to pay off collateral damage costs?) hamper the experience a bit, but the core racing and pursuit is fun.\n\nThere is a point where the main story stops taking itself seriously. You will know the exact line where this happens. At that point, it becomes much, much more fun. Treat it like a campy romp through the Autobahn, with the excessive driving of an 80's TV show and the pyrotechnics of a Michael Bay movie, and you'll get exactly that. And a monster truck. You also get a monster truck. So there's that.\n\nYou unlock more tracks and cars by playing through the game, and while there are plenty of street races on the open highway, there are also legitimate race courses, which add a nice variety to the overall experience. You can take on races with undercover cop cars, tuners, a Formula 1 car, and armored trucks, so you can make any race as intense or as preposterous as you'd like. I can't vouch for the multiplayer experience, having yet to try this with someone else, but from my single-player look at Single Race mode, it seems pretty solid. Reminds me of the classic NFS games, especially with mods that let you drive firetrucks and such.\n\nIn short, a surprisingly intense thrill ride on the cheap, with some design quirks here and there that may strike you as odd, but aren't nearly bad enough to make this game hard at all to recommend. Also, cool original soundtrack.","January 29, 2014","true","11.0"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","17","21","0","0"

The dialogue and voice acting are hilarious because they're trying their best to put on their American badass cop accents and use American badass cop lingo, but they're all clearly untrained German actors. I feel bad laughing though becase they've clearly put their hearts into it.\n\nThe game looks good and there is enough action to keep you engaged, but the difficulty of the missions varies wildly and I'm still not sure how to finish mission 1.4 in which you spot the bad guy, the game goes into a quick cut scene, then it comes out of it and he races out of sight as you try to catch him and the mission fails 15 seconds later.\n\nOnly worth the on-sale price, but it's brainless fun in a believable world if you can get it cheap.","August 18, 2014","true","1.1"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

What really matters is that this game is actually fun.\n\nThe handling is the best part in my opinion. Every car is noticeably different and how each one behaves actually makes sense. Overall the handling is on realistic side, but still arcade enough to go nuts! Damage system is decent, but will not have an impact on gameplay. Vehicle selection is plentiful and some cannot be found elsewhere. Visuals are great where it matters in such game, yet its very easy on the hardware.\n\nThe game does support gamepads and every action can be individually assigned and even deadzones can be adjusted.\n\nBut wait, there is splitscreen!!!

Despite the semi-realistic handling you have NOS, and crashes sometimes cause large fiery explosions. Graphics are kind of good for the era (2009), though textures and models are kind of lacking at the same time.  Voice acting is cheesy.  Apparently the 4th & 5th releases of CT are out in Germany.

The scenery and free-roaming ability are nice, but the story just isn't very enjoyable and the gameplay could be a lot more interesting. You can put in your own soundtracks, which made the game a lot more bearable, but it still didn't feel like I was doing much besides getting scolded for eating doughnuts after arresting someone.\n\nThe game tries to mix realism with arcade qualities, but it doesn't turn out well. Give this game a try if you want, but I don't recommend it.","July 4, 2014","false","1.2"," 4 of 13 people (31%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","31","4","13","2","0"
