Added concerns about business model.\n\nI was a founder of this title months ago - and have watched it make steady progress as it has approached early access.\n\nThe devs are communicative and attentive on the official forums, and since "Progress" is the only way you can truly evaluate an early access title, I want to give this game - and its devs - a tentative thumbs up.\n\nHowever, there are still some questions concerning exactly where they are headed with their overall design philosophy.  Many months ago, I questioned the unit variety, and whether it was robust enough to allow for tactical and strategic diversity - I was assured that "many" more would be added.  Now that the title is in early access, it is stated that "Most of the units are ready," - but it has the same unit count it had during pre-alpha.  This has me worried about the future of this title - an RTS without "strategy" is "Real time...?"  If the devs intend to release a title where each race has 14 units which all behave so similarly that the differences between them are borderline cosmetic, they will fail to meet the expectations of RTS players at large - RTS players want choices, options, and decisions.\n\nThe low unit variety may be assuaged by release if the developers put in enough effort to allow units to stand out in form and function.  14 units is more than enough to provide strategic depth if each of those units represents a discrete tool in the player's strategic toolbox.  However, now this is not the case - you sprinkle a few of each tech tier and type into a big blob and hurl it at your foes.\n\nMy biggest fear for this title is that the developers may release a strategically shallow RTS and attempt to fix it with paid content releases.  If they do this, it's unlikely the title will be well received initially and with a small enough playerbase an expansion release could easily kill the multiplayer experience and community by splitting it.  I hope they read their reviews and are careful not to do this!\n\nIf you are a hardcore RTS fan and you are willing to go out on a limb and assist in the development of this title, then I would say this is worth a shot.\n\nIf you are not a hardcore RTS fan and are looking for a finished game to play, then I would absolutely advise waiting until full release to see if this game's core concepts are robust enough to be worth the asking price.","October 24, 2015","true","32.4"," 238 of 251 people (95%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","95","238","251","7","12"

Not a battle, not some skirmish ...war.\nThat is what you engage in with this game.\nYou do not move a few units here and there, you move armies!\nYou dont stop with a few building and call it good, you rise up bases across the map.\nHere territory means resources as the reverse should also be true!\nIn this game STRATEGY CONQUERS ALL!\n\nThe game has nice graphics. watching the enemy line be atomised by heavy laser fir from my titan advance is all so enticing and encites me to continue the advance if only to see more battle.\ni have notice a rathe large amount of problems regarding to issuing commands however now with the beta release many of those problems have been dealt with so i guess the devs had seen them too.\nthe gameplay in of itself is rather simple, no real need to learn alot in order to play if you can handle any RTS you can handle this (YOUR STRATEGY MAY BE ANOTHER STORY).\n\nI mentioned controlling armies opposed to units and while yes the units make the army you will find that sending 200 units to act as a mobile wall, with another 100 or so as cannon fodder to delay a point being taken on the other side of the map,  an air strike force circling around all of that in the numbers of another 100 or so and one more massive push straight through the enemy center with 500 units... may in fact not even be late game. with six players that may indeed be early game.\nNumbers can help you win any engagement, but... it is the proper use of those numbers that in the end will see you victorious.\nYou might be wondering "well how many units can i control?" to this dont have an exact.\nbefore the latest patch (and i havent yet seen anything to tell me different) after winning the game with a logistics cap of 3000+ (should be noted the titans which are your bigest units only cost around 30 logistics) i had decided to continue the game and push my research to answer the question of just how many can be at my call... I reached 105,000 before i quit knowing that such numbers in a real game would be absurd but yet even as i pressed the EXIT button still there was reserarch to do and higher numbers to obtain.\n\nAll in all the scope of this game is fantasic, i cant wait for the finishing touches to be applyed.\nonce again stardock has not disappointed.\n\nAshes to ashes, dust to dust...","January 29","true","87.0"," 305 of 348 people (88%) found this review helpful 40 people found this review funny","88","305","348","40","8"

When I first saw this game, I honestly didn't like it, thought it looked generic and had little to offer. I'm always a sucker for these types of games, sooner or later I knew I would buy it, here are some of my thoughts:\n\nUpdated 5 March 2016:\n\nPositives:\n-Game has developed nicely since the latest Beta 2 patch, great work on the dreadnoughts and adding variation and depth for some of the key units\n-Large variety of maps\n-DX12\n-Unit artwork and overall design are interesting and highly detailed - cutting edge\n-Various classes of units, all have a unique purpose, some say you just cluster them together and attack, they would be missing out on the beauty of joint operations and combined firepower, using spotters and long range shooters etc.\n-Orbital powers and unique game changing elements, this aspect has improved more so since the latest update\n-Maps are well laid out and offer something unique to each, fit the game design well\n-Sound is refreshing and exceptional, at first I was disappointed that there was no voice for each unit, though currently their sound is unique and distinctive, makes sense, the sound in this game is really good. The sound effects have improved tremendously since the last update\n-Gameplay is fantastic, the AI in skirmish is already very competent and likely only going to get better, definitely already a strong aspect of this game, it’s really good for SP players\n-Good use of recon drones and medic units - well implemented\n-Great Development team, very similar approach to Eugen Systems, they have a love for this game and it shows, they are awesome and interact with the players often and are always looking to improve aspects of the game\n-Reminds me of SUPCOM to a degree - with improved graphics and significantly better sound effects\n-I'm using a i7-920 stock, Gigabyte G1 Gaming 970, 12GB Ram, Win10 and I'm able to play with every setting maxed at 2K, no issues at all.\n\n\nNegatives:\n-Still some rough edges, though I expect them to be ironed out, more so polishing, this is to be expected given its in Beta 2\n-No other types of units beyond hover, though I have to admit the hover units are working much better in game than I expected, this was something I was worried about, would still like to see tracked, wheeled, walkers, mechs etc. in the game at some point\n-Only two factions, would have like to have had three\n-Would like to see each faction have about five more units prior to final release\n-Ability to interact with skirmish AI partners would be awesome to see, go here, defend this spot, please assist me, focus on this area, attack, please help now, the type of unit communications in SUPCOM, C&C, AOE and other RTS games\n\nI will add and change to this review as the game progresses, though to keep things simple, if you are an RTS fan or enjoy strategy gaming in general, grab this game.  As you play more the game grows on you fast, there are a lot of tactics to be employed, this is easily one of the best RTS games to come out in years. I can only imagine how much more improved its going to be by launch, in its current condition, I would easily give it a 8.0 out of 10, with the score getting higher as more things are added. I highly recommend Ashes of the Singularity; it has a chance to become an all-time RTS classic.","January 31","true","13.3"," 217 of 242 people (90%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","90","217","242","7","16"

Well, the most simple way to get an answer to that is by buying the game, its simple as that, if you dont like it then you can get a refund if you played the game less than 2 hours or owned it less than 48 hours.\n\nIn my opinion, this game is great and looks absolutely promising, this was one of those lovely little surprises, Ive wanted a game like this for quite some time and now it is here and god it is enjoyable in my opinion.\n\nNow here are some things that are good/bad in the game alright?;\n\nGOOD:\n\n1. The game looks great, the graphics are good and they are getting improved as we speak.\n\n2. You have to plan ahead or else you will easily be defeated.\n\n3. The game is not super easy, it takes quite some time to learn and fully master but its not too difficult to learn either, but if you dont like "wasting" 5-10 hours into a game before you fully know how to play it, then dont bother buying this.\n\n4. Units.. every single unit in this game has a purpose which is great, every unit does something well that some else unit wont do.\n\n5. The game has 2 factions/races, PHC & The Substrate, and HOPEFULLY and probably a third faction/race will be added into the game at some point after the game has been released. Alot of people have been disappointed that it only has two currently and should have like 4. Well the game is just a beta currently and is not even close to being finished and being a final product..\n\n6. The developers appreciate your feedback so they can make the game better! Alot of game devs do not listen to the community enough. I cant stress enough how important our feedback for the devs is so we can make the game better\n\n7. There are plenty of maps currently in total and every map is different from each other, there are winter maps, desert maps and generic "summertime" maps which have trees and grass and overall look beautiful. More maps will also be added so we wont be running low on those!\n\n8. The music in this game is absolutely fantastic, every song is well made and extremely pleasant to hear and fits well into the AoTS universe.\n\n9. The game has multiplayer and singleplayer, you can play against the AI alone or with a friend or you can match up against real person is 1v1 battle or make a custom battle and fight 3v3 with your friends which would be really awesome, too bad I dont have enough friends who play this game. I recommend playing atleast 10 hours before attempting to play against real players unless they are your friends, experienced players will defeat unexperienced players way too easily. You should play against the AI on normal difficulty and thats a minimum! any lower than that and the game is boring as ♥♥♥♥, the AI barely does anything on lowest difficulty which is how it is supposed to be but still. higher than normal and the game starts to be more difficult which is good, the AI will use air units aswell against you and my god how many times Ive been almost wiped out because of air units, dont under estimate the AI on higher difficulty levels! Big mistake! Singleplayer campaign/Story will be added to the game later on.\n\n\n\n\nBAD:\n\n1. Although I mentioned this on the good side its still scary for me, I honestly hope that they come up with some interesting and cool third faction if they even make it afterall. It would increase the game's lifetime because it wouldnt get boring too soon because it doesnt have enough variety in factions.\n\n2. The game has some bugs&glitches as expected because it is currently a beta, although it doesnt have any major issues atleast not for me, some people have given reports that the game wont start or it will randomly crash but so far for me and couple of my friends its working fine, the chances of it not starting when you play is extremely low unless your pc is a potatoe.\n\n3. This is not a bad thing in my opinion but I guess there are alot of people who might consider this as a bad thing; The game is demanding, you MUST have a decent modern gaming pc in order to get the best experience out of this game. You just wont be able to play the game with 3-4 years old system that well. I highly recommend getting atleast gpu with vram capacity of 4gb.\n\n4. The multiplayer is sometimes really buggy&glitchy, sometimes during a game the game will just crash or it will simply lag too much. It will be fixed though, like I have mentioned before, this is just a beta.\n\n\n\nI really dont have anything that much to complain about, the game is great and overall good.\n\nIn its current state I'd give it a score of 8/10.\n\n\n\nIt took me like +30 minutes to make this so I hope this helped some of you and I hope that other AoTS players will appreciate my effort making things clear and telling my personal opinion about the game in its current state and so on.","February 5","true","152.3"," 224 of 270 people (83%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","83","224","270","11","0"

I have enjoyed my skirmeshes with the AI (I believe I played on Challenging most times), but have not ventured online because my internet is slow (~2 mbits/sec).

The game "at this time" is certainly not as chaotic as SupCom, or as action packed as your average Starcraft match. However, I played this with some other people, and we enjoyed the heck out of it.\n\nI certainly encountered some bugs, as is expected for an Early Access title. Some were crashes to desktop, and some were MP games that failed to load properly and required a game exit and restart. There are features that are not yet implemented, and some optimizations that need to be done.\n\nHowever, we played a few games that lasted over an hour, and had hundreds of units clashing at once. The matches seem slow at times, and at other times a bit hectic but in good measure. We also were able to save a match midgame, and returned to it after, so a huge plus for those that want to play MP, but cannot commit to long stretches at a time.\n\nMy system is pretty good, running at recommended or better hardware, and while there were some slowdowns, overall the benchmarks were pretty decent. I was also running at max settings, so there's lots of room for tweaking and I expect the optimizations to make it even better.\n\nOverall, the game feels solid and I look forward to the new content as it gets added. I will continue to update this review as time goes on, but being Early Access I would say do your homework to see if you are really wanting to jump in early.\n\nAs for me? This SupCom fan is a happy camper, and the fact the guys I play MP with normally also had a good time, I'd definitely recommend this game.","October 22, 2015","true","11.9"," 118 of 136 people (87%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","87","118","136","4","6"

Put units into an army, and they simply work smartly together.  No micromanagement!\n- Micromanagement is at a minimal level for a game of this scale.  Armies are generally smart enough (assuming decent unit composition) to actually follow orders and execute on them relatively well\n- The games visuals and tech are amazing.  The Nitous engine (which is what this game runs on) is a beauty and looks so lovely that I switched graphics cards to run it better\n\nWhat is Good about this game:\n\n- Good unit variety with excellent hard counters (e.g. Apollo > Bomber > Zeus > Apollo across several different combinations of units etc)\n- Dreadnoughts look and play amazingly - good depth and satisfaction to their upgrade tree, just fun to watch blow stuff up\n- There is almost unlimited skill-ceiling even against the AI as the skirmish AI is quite excellent\n- A good game of skirmish can feel epic and still be done in 30-60 minutes\n\nWhat could be improved in this game:\n\n- Some of the controls can be a little fiddly:\n- Very large groups of units don't form armies entirely well (e.g. perpetually having the option to group into an army even after you just gave that command)\n- If an army loses its "lead" unit (i.e. the biggest highest level unit), the army appears to forget all its orders and ungroups\n- Sometimes giving simple capture node orders simply won't work, and you have to target either around the node or click many times which can be frustrating\n- The dreadnaught upgrades can be a little tedious on very large maps.  Would be nice if there was an icon in the GUI similar to the idle engineer icon to simply auto-find them and select them to upgrade faster with less hunting, even if you find them, can sometimes be hard to select the exact ship among a large group\n- I wish the "tech"/quanta upgrade tree was deeper (i.e. more options than just more damage/more health - maybe faster movement, armor penetration, stronger fixed defenses, etc)\n- The AI can be tough even at lower difficulties until you learn the game pretty well\n- Would love more large skirmish maps\n- The story and campaign are lacking, but that isn't why I play RTS games.  As an aside, I also don't order salads at a steakhouse :)\n\nConclusion:\n\nThis is simply the best skirmish RTS game to come out probably since Supreme Commander.  And even so, the devs are working on it constantly to improve on the game, and the progress continues to show.  If you like RTS games, and particularly RTS games that focus on the skirmish mode or large-to-epic scale RTS games, this game is really second to none right now.\n\n9.5 / 10.0","April 22","true","92.5"," 118 of 137 people (86%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","86","118","137","9","7"

On the positive side you can see ppl clamouring the revival of the great epic scale RTSes, on the negative side you see people clamouring on how poorly it is built in the general comparison sense to other RTSes.\n\nNow here's my take on it:\nThis is a game that is meant to be a MacroRTS based gameplay. Sure you have no differences whatsoever in terms of zooming in and out as functionality for such fidelity per unit but then again, you can just press space and hop to the focused event.\n\nThe moment I start the game I am already heading to the macro based gameplay where CROSS MAP APM matters more than micromap APM. See this is what kills it for half of the RTS fans who are all in the negative review camp for this game. You can't deflect, counter, micromanage your way out of a swarm of brutes and dreadnaughts that have the range of an entire sector, but you can call for orbital help. If your units are out of position, they take a long time to reinforce a position then your entirely screwed. This means having preemptive tactics, preemptive strikes, flanking and macromanaging are your go to skills for this game. To some (infact many modern RTS players who were born in the microRTS golden era), this is a severe let down.\n\nBack in those days, to those who were lucky enough to be born in the age of total anihhilation enjoying the thrill during its peak time, collosal battles across the map, 5 maybe 20 divisions of units engaging at a time on multiple fronts was a thing, no, it was THE THING! Total Annihilation swept the best game of all time for decades! It gave casual players means to learn and play since macroplay is very forgiving and gradual, unlike MicroRTS where scaling and the snowballing effect is rampant.\n\nWe MacroRTS ppl love to give others a shot on the same playing field, on the same mindset of casual/slow pace but enthralling climb to the epic end on a static but functional playing field with a plethora of "self made objectives". MicroRTS doesn't give you this feeling. It almost always counts on TrueAPM, if your not fast enough with your hands and mind which require practice with each microRTS hotkey combination practice, and a set objective that isnt very dynamic because your units are too individualized and static to a set tactical play. Just watch the countless SC2, War3, Red Alert genre type matches...dont you always see a kind of trend of a set tactic like a reaper rush or zergling rush, or an suicide flak truck. There's this set structure on how you play them and thats it...they cant be useful anywhere else after that.\n\nWelcome to MacroRTS folks, where brawns and brain doesn't really matter on an equal tradeoff field. Its how you dynamically adapt to evolving situations, and this game shines in this. I just hope this is not all the units, races, that we end up with.\n\nI'll continue watching this game!\n\nUpdate:\n- For those experiencing graphics problem, remember, you have to restart the entire game...not just in game to apply new settings","February 27","true","20.9"," 88 of 97 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","88","97","2","0"

Great underlying technology making the game future proof: DX12, multi GPU support, fully utilizes my multicore system.\n2.

By borrowing bits and pieces from various other RTS games out there, this game has become it's own beast. Don't go into this expecting it to be exactly like another Supcom/TA.\n\nAshes of the Singularity is a mixed bag. It is best described as a combination between Supreme Commander and Sins of a Solar Empire. It is an RTS with a streaming economy based around forming groups of units into meta-units (called armies in game), and then fighting over spots on the map that take time to capture like a Relic RTS.\n\nThe campaign is honestly pretty meh. The difficulty curve spikes rapidly in places, only to be smooth sailing again for a few stages afterwards. Despite these difficulty spikes, veteran RTS players will probably find themselves blowing through the campaign pretty quickly. I had to surrender twice during the campaign, and both times I finished the stage no problem once I knew what was going to happen.\n\nThe story is predictable, rudimentary, and tacked on. The voice acting is pretty terrible, especially for the female. The in battle conversation is just text that is jarring and constantly yanking your view away from what you are trying to do. Not only is the in game text not voice acted (probably a good thing with the poor quality of it anyway), but there aren't even animations or portraits to make it interesting. The in battle dialogue can honestly be skipped, and it wouldn't change the experience much as most of the conversation boils down to, "Insert middle-school play complexity of dialogue to justify this battle." The player starts off as a "neophyte" that is brought in to assist the big boys, and suddenly about 3/4s of the way through you have apparently made enough of a name for yourself that you are considered "quite powerful." However, I didn't feel the crescendo here. It just felt tacked on like the rest. Suddenly I was strong and scary, I guess because I had won so many battles, but there was no real explanation for anything.\n\nOverall, you aren't missing much if you skip it and just jump into skirmish or multiplayer.\n\nThe multiplayer is where this game shines. I was top 10 or 20 at one point during the beta, so I have a fair amount of ranked games under my belt. It's slower paced than most RTS (although, still much faster paced that Sins of a Solar Empire), which means success isn't based just as much on your apm as it is your strategy like most modern RTS games. On bigger maps, your ability to keep track of and control multiple fronts at the same time will still be relevant though, so APM isn't completely irrelevant.\n\nThe two races aren't exact copy pastas of eachother, but neither are they drastically different. Their units are different in both look and in the manner in which they attack, but in the end both sides tend to have units that fulfill the same role. For example, PHC has artillery cruisers and dreadnoughts, while Substrate has drone cruisers and dreadnoughts. Their method of attack is different, but they both basically fulfill the same function. The same can be said for other units. Both have a close range, tanky, t1 unit that costs only metal, and then both have a t1 longer ranged fragile unit designed to sit behind those tanks. One shoots a laser, the other shoots a rocket, but they are essentially the same thing.\n\nIf you prefer to spend your RTS time in multiplayer or skirmish, than this game is an interesting take on the genre. While Ashes isn't doing anything that hasn't been seen before, it is taking the good parts from various other RTS games and mixing them together into a concoction that is new.","April 1","true","37.0"," 77 of 85 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","77","85","2","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kingshaun7/recommended/228880/","kingshaun7","King Shaun","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kingshaun7/","184 products in account","So far I'd rather have spent my time playing another RTS.\n\n"not just a battle, but a war across entire worlds"\nThe maps can be really big and that is a cool feature of the game, but the headline is overhyped. There isn't some type of multi-world battle or strategy, this isn't pax imperia. It's just like dawn of war, starcraft, etc. but with a bigger map. In theory, the size of the map represents an entire planet, but then again, consider that the units in this game are in theory very large (see below, up to a kilometer long).\n\n"Over the course of your war, you will construct thousands of units"\nLike most RTS, a match is typically won or lost way before you're managing thousands of units. It was pretty neat to play against the AI and instead of killing it off, building up a massive army for grins.\n\n"Huge, kilometer-long Dreadnoughts "\nWow, kilometer long?! That sounds so cool, but when I play it's maybe a half inch in my monitor. It might as well be a Terran Battleship or Protoss Carrier. Do the developers really think this is a defining feature of the game? Aside from their size, dreadnaughts are kinda cool because they level up. They only go up to level 5, but each level adds significantly more guns, shields, etc. During a long match I end up with dozens of them, so when an army of them levels up clicking on each one and choosing shilds, guns, or whatever is kind of a chore. It wouldn't be worth mentioning if it wasn't so hard to click on them when they're near each other. Unfortunately selecting units doesn't use a line-of-sight mechanic so the engine considers a particular dreadnaught as on top and any clicks in a radius around it selects that dreadnaught, not the one actually under your mouse. If there are 3 dreadnaughts next to each other, you better hope the one in the middle isn't on the "bottom" according to the engine or you can't click on it directly.\n\n"every unit's vision is based on line of sight instead of a radial fog of war."\nThis sounds pretty cool. This means that you can't see an enemy if he's hiding behind a building just because its within radius. On the down side, since units can fire without revealing themselves vision is very powerful. Appearently units also can't see up hills, which is super annoying because a unit can sit on a hill and rain terror without anyone being able to see him.\n\nActually, the line of sight feature has been a strategic nightmare so far. Some troops tend to automically back up (to max range?) in combat, going down a hill leaving them vulnarable to LOS advantage. While on higher ground troops are able to fire and it provides no vision or chance to return file, at all. Some maps have the bases on a raised area, which is constantly a problem because troops are too stupid to walk up the hill to gain vision. I've seen troops standing around not doing anything, not firing on the enemy, not getting closer to engage, nothing... just because the enemy was up a hill... even after issuing an attack command!!!, even with vision of the top (my base was on the hill for crying out loud!). I had to tell the troops to move up the hill first with a move command, then they figured out they should return fire and defend the base. I guess my own base was blocking my own units from having direct LOS on the enemy? How stupid. The aerial scouts work the exact opposite way and always rush in to their death.\n\n"Non-cheating AI Engine"\nAI manages to abuse visibility over mountains to fire long range missiles on your troops and base. They can see you, but you can't see them. If you fly a probe/scout over your troops to extend vision it works for a moment. There is no "stand ground" or "hold" command so whenever the scout sees an enemy it always flys in to wreck havok with its 1 damage pee shooter and die a terrible death. Then you lose vision so your troops and base are helpless again. There is no attack command either, only move, stop, and attack-move. Which brings me to the next point.\n\n"Winning is about strategy, not speed"\nEverything seems to be left to the AI, which has failed me repeatedly.\nBTW, it's still a real time game... so speed is still a factor.\nIt's just less of a factor.\n\nYou can form armies, but you can't organize them, as in other strategy games like Shogun 2. Sometimes the healing/force field recharging unit ends up at the front of the army... meat shields go there! wth.\n\n"Command Unique Units, Factions, Orbitals, and Abilities"\nHaving multiple factions/races is nothing special, but it's worth mentioning I guess. I don't recall playing a RTS where the factions didn't have unique units since WarCraft 1 and 2 days back in the 90's... on DOS. And now the WarCraft II sound track is playing in my head again. Did I play that much WarCraft II, or was the soundtrack just that good? I'm pretty sure the answer is Both!\n\nThe "orbital" commands can be very powerful. Which means you have to build orbital nullification buildings along your attack route or huge psy-storms and nukes will constantly wreck your army while healing waves buff theirs. Also, the enemy builds nullifiers all over so you can't use abilities while attacking, only they can. It's like... what's the point. When you're assulting a base, by the time your units are deep enough to take out the nullifier, you've pretty much won the fight anyway.\n\n\nHopefully, the full launch of the game provides a better tutorial and all of the issues were just due to a learning curve. The game has some neat ideas. I really liked the idea of a strong enough AI that you don't have to micro-manage your units, I just wish it worked better. Speaking of AI in the more traditional sense, when I select a "computer" opponent I've gotten to the point where one AI is too easy to beat, and the next AI difficulty setting is impossible to beat because it constantly abuses mechanics like vision and orbitals which just ruins the experience for me. So far my impression is that I'd rather have spent my time playing one of the other mainstream RTS titles out there.","March 22","false","15.8"," 113 of 147 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","113","147","2","4"

Beta2 is a big jump up from the previous version. The AI is the best I've played in RTS, there's a working ranked MP ladder with seasons already, and a SP campaign will come at launch. The sound effect work is really satisfyingly well-done, giving character to machines and the graphics are damn purdy. The music is done by 2 composers (from Civ 5 and Battlestar Galactica) and suitably epic and cinematic.\n\nSome gameplay elements that stand out: orbital abilities (global use abilities that run the gamut of offensive and support), grouping units into a meta unit army with its own AI and automatic unit positioning, dreadnought units (kind of super units) that level up and gain abilities, several defensive and support structures to build, a variety of different resources to manage (4 really, including what are essentially "victory points" as an alternate win condition).\n\nThere's currently 2 factions with a 3rd likely in dlc later. They aren't totally asymmetrical but there are enough differences that they feel different to play and you have some different tactics and unit types available. If you enjoy a slower paced, more macro style RTS that takes some inspiration from older games, you'll easily get your money's worth out of Ashes.","February 25","true","254.1"," 46 of 52 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","46","52","2","0"

Such as\n- Lack of graphical/icon clarity.  In particular it's very hard to spot whether a resource has an extractor built on it without zooming in, and it's hard to quickly get an idea of the makeup of an army.\n- Missing macro features, such as being able to pause factories, assist engineers, have units auto-join armies or follow complex rally paths when built\n\nThese things are not fundamental problems, but they are somewhat game-breaking in terms of the game's chance at sucess.  Hopefully Stardock will have learned, finally, that releasing games with these easy-to-fix-but-review-tarnishing issues is not wise, and will make certain that they've been cleared up before official launch.\n\nThe game itself has a huge amount of promise, and it's the first of its kind in quite some time.  If it can get these quality of life & polish improvements, it could easily be a hit.","January 31","true","3.9"," 58 of 73 people (79%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","79","58","73","6","0"

I have no doubt that this game will go down in the annals of history with such game greats as Home World, Supreme Commander, WiC, SoSE and Wargame(s)\n\nThe developers respond to feed back and are very committed/dedicated to the game and they want people to get envolved, they love hearing ideas from the community. Balance is pretty solid, and gets fixed quite quickly if it gets thrown off by an update. There is a pretty solid core group of alpha founders that are very helpful and want to see the game become the best it can be.\n\n1. This game is like chess on steriods.\n2. The graphics (specifically models) are better than any game of this scale that I have seen. (at least in 4k!) ;)\n3. This is macro not micro, however some abilities, MAY be able to be used in micro, eventually.\n4. This game introduces a new unit/command and control concept called the meta unit. THIS IS #$%^ING AWESOME!\n5. So many aspects of the game, even the ones that are quite functional are still being worked on, yet the core is pretty solid.\n6. On my machine, I have yet to experience game lag. Although, I don't think I have had that many units on screen at one time, maybe couple thousand including AI.\n7. I usually play offline, so game hours are a lot more.\n8. This game is PRE beta. PRE means before, yeah?, like as in before being a beta? Okay.\n9. I have spent2-1/2 times what they are asking for right now, and I have already got MY moneys worth out of it. It has been a blast to watch the game evolve and unfold.\n\nIf you like intense strategy games, on a massive scale, where the composition of your force is a form of customization and main tactic to your overall strategy, then you'll like this game, but that doesn't mean you should get it now. But you'll want a powerful system, some patience and some reasonability to what PRE beta means if you do.\n\nSystem Specs: 4930K Ivy Bridge-E 6 core @4.5Ghz, 16Gig Ram, SSDs, Radeon Fury-X and 4k monitor.\n\nI hope this was helpful.","October 22, 2015","true","33.0"," 55 of 70 people (79%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","79","55","70","5","0"

Not to say that this game isn't fast at all, but does not require the micromanagement of other RTS's. There is also a campaign, but acts more like an extended tutorial and lacks any sense of personality. That is not what this game was made for however, and the skirmish mode and multiplayer is where this game shines. Most people seem to compare this game to Supreme Commander, but it actually has more incommon with Sins of a Solar Empire.\n\nMacro over micro, that's one way to describe what you will be doing with this game. Controlling how much resources you're getting and the amount of units that are in you're army still takes a bit of micromanagement, but actual placement of your armies is pretty straight forward. Later, when you geta handle on the nuiances of the units, you get a feel for when you should attack, defend, and where to place defences and use powers. One of the weaknesses of the win conditions however is that there is a resource you get and if someone gets enough of it then they win the match. This can be a bumber and forces a more aggressive strategy; and also just makes the game feel like you weren't able to experience the full joy of creating just enormous armies of units to crush your enemies with. Thankfully this can be turned off or turned up to an enormous amount, so that you have to take out your oppenents' bases to end the match in glorious destruction.\n\nIf you have ever played Sins, then you can see a sort of similarity in the flow of combat. You and your opponents struggle for control of certain nodes that have resources connected to them, much like the planets in Sins but a bit faster. There only two types of resources to make units, but this keeps things simple and only the more advanced units use the rarer one. Which brings me to the dreadnoughts, much like in Sins, these behemoths can level up and gain more abilities, health, and fire power. As of right now there are only three of them, but with afore mentioned abilities you can create armies to specialize in different forms of warfar, such as long range bombardment, close range support, and aggressive damage.\n\nThere's also only two different factions, but they are well balanced and feel very solid with enough differences to feel alien to the other. One faction, the humans (who have created the singularity and uploaded themselves into computers) behave like most stereotypical human factions and should feel very familiar to veterans of the genre and new players should find them easy to use, the Substrate however behave differently. Many of their units use Power to fire their weapons and if they run out, they can't fire. This balanced out with humans because the Substrate's weapons are quite powerful and always hit, with the exception of the artillary units and a few others. Having only two different factions may sound like a draw back, but it actually feels just right for this game and I wouldn't be surprised if they did announce they were going to make another faction but does not bring the game down at this time.\n\nOverall this is a game for capital S, Strategy gamers. Managing your supply lines of units and locations of your armies is paramount. This is a very solid entry to the strategy genre and takes after greats such as Supreme Commander and Sins. This is also a good game for newcomers to the genre, with simplier, yet nuanced strategies that demand much from the player in order for them to become good, but are also simple enough for them to understand.","April 3","true","10.1"," 33 of 38 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","33","38","0","0"

For example things like bug reports, logs compiling Data to help the Devs, looking for how your system is running and how hot it's getting, how it's being uitilized. from the information i gathere, they are NOT looking to make money off the earlie access like 90% of developers (exibit 1: H1Z1)\n\nthe game is fun for what you get, i've put a few hours in and i will be putting many more hours in the future. i like the fact this game isn't aimed at micromanagement like Star craft, command and conquer, Men of war/call to arms, just to name a few. as it stands i can have Wars that go for hours with thousands of units on the field, not battles that go on for 20-30min and i find it challanging but fun at the same time.\n\nDon't get me wrong this game isn't anywhere near complete, there are allot of features missing and there's been some fustrating crashes but i'm willing to bear with it because i persionally like this game. it may not be to everyones fancy so take it with a grain of salt, if you don't like it that's why steam offers refunds. i get fustrated when people leave bad reviews (which are usually quite funny as i can sit there and say "what'd you expect it's pre-Beta"), This game is an Alpha so you should approach it like it's in ALPHA not a finished game. be prepared for your fair share of annoyances, heartachs and crashes, if you can't stomach those then it's simple. Don't Buy Earlie Access!.\n\nReview Edit: all of the above has stayed the same, however i was looking around the fourms and seeing some people asking why the game was slow or unresponcive and it turns out it's lag, this game is very Bandwith intensive and from the Dev himself "Broadand with a Minimum 1.5Mbps bothways (up and download i assume) is required which explains why i get lag in MP, my Australian internet can get between 5Mbps and 20Mbps download however i struggle to get 0.87Mbps Upload speed which could explain lag i'm getting but still in a 2player V 2 Normal/Challanging AI there is minimul lag however larger 3v3 battles to get abit more laggy which is understandable with how many units can be moving at any one time, this does not affect SP ofcourse but as games like this tend to be Multiplayer orented it is something to keep in mind, they were not lieing when they told you that you need high end specs to play this game. i'm still overheating my R9 280x (3Gb) so keep an eye on those temps. mind you i'm running a stock cooler on the GPU with some pretty weak fans on the case.\n\na post from the dev\n\nOriginally posted by Draginol:Basically, the target we're going for is 30K (K-bytes) per second for 6 players.  That's about 250 kilobits per second.  Bear in mind that means a consistent .25mb/s.\n\nAs a practical matter, the game requires broadband.  I know that stinks for people who don't have access to broadband for any number of reasons.\nso that's a 2Mbps up and down and i don't even have half the upload speed.","December 16, 2015","true","22.3"," 56 of 77 people (73%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","73","56","77","5","9"

I have played next to no multiplayer, but I can attest that there were always people online whenever I checked.\n\nThis game is a bit of a spiritual successor to Total Annihilation (NOT Supreme Commander, lest you get confused), and borrows the Company of Heroes resource mechanic and emphasis on offense (you must capture nodes and have them all be connected to collect resources). These are the two games Ashes is most like, again, it is not similar to Supreme Commander in any way besides large (uncapped!) unit counts.\n\nRight now, the primary means of winning is Boom and Rush, though the devs have indicated improved turtling mechanics coming up (The developers of this game are extremely active, with updates adding features, units, maps, tweaks, etc. released very nearly every week). That said, as it is now (and even after more turtling options), if you aren't constantly pushing, you will not win. There is no time to sit back, and fortifications exist primarily to lock down a specific forward operating base or delay an enemy advance.\n\nIf all that sounds like your cup of tea, you'll love Ashes! If you're a fan of strategy in general, you will at least enjoy it. If the fun of strategy for you is to turtle up, build an economy behind your impenetrable walls, and then advance on the enemy, this game will not be for you.\n\nI tend to lean closer to Turtle/Boom (and hate rushing), so while I can recommend this game regardless of your playstyle, as it is well crafted and enjoyable, I would caution players that like pure Turtle best to pick it up on a sale.","April 27","true","26.9"," 29 of 32 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","29","32","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Divran/recommended/228880/","Divran","Divran","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Divran/","199 products in account","I love Supreme Commander, Forged Alliance. (Supcom 2 sucks)\nFor that reason, comparing this game to FA is obvious, and is something everyone that has ever played FA will do.\n\nPros:\n+ Runs better than FA. But so does nearly every game due to the fact that FA only uses one core. I've noticed other people mentioning that it's strange that you need the latest high-end graphics card to be able to play this. Since I have one of those, I can't really say what would happen if you don't.\n\n+ Uses the same economy system as FA (rather than supcom 2's method)\n\n+ Has global unit upgrades. FA didn't have these, and you could say that it doesn't need it, but it's a nice feature. Supcom 2 just did it wrong, in the sense that they had only a few unit types and then expected you to solely rely on upgrades. Ashes at least has about 8 different land units, 3 different Dreadnaughts ("experimentals", sort of), 3 different air units, and then some misc others. You do get some units to choose from, although it's nowhere near the amount found in FA.\n\nCons:\n- Uses slow unit movement speed instead of making maps actually large. The end result might be the same, but it doesn't feel right to me.\n\n- Sound effects are TERRIBLE. Music is worse. I've turned the sound off in the game and I'll probably be using spotify or something next time I play. This is actually the first time I've played a game where I can't stand the sound.\n\n- (TLDR: Turtling is literally impossible.) Only way to gain income is to capture metal points across the map. There is no way to generate income in your base, so turtling is not even a possibility. In FA, normally you'd not really want to turtle if you're playing a normal game, but since I enjoy that playstyle, I'd do it in custom games or games against AIs and such. Here, turtling impossible. Also, I find there's not even any point to building turrets. Better to build an army of bombers to quickly respond to the enemy's attacks where your main army isn't at. Plus, bombers are much more versatile since they can also help your ground army. There are also no bubble shields. Who doesn't love shields?\n\n- (TLDR: Good graphics, terrible models) While good graphics don't make a game good, it does have an effect on the game. This game is weird. The game itself has good graphics, and it does use DX12 which probably helps. However, the models have no animations, and very little particle effects. They all rotate their entire body to face the enemy. Also, every single one of them hovers. I assume this was done to allow more units to be on the screen at one time, but it kills immersiveness. It feels like I'm commanding an army of cheap plastic toys rather than the massive war machines of death that FA has. In addition, some models are straight up bad.\n\nConclusion:\nThis game doesn't stand a chance against Forged Alliance. The sounds are terrible, and the models make you feel like you're playing toy story, and not the next generation of large scale RTS.\nIf you're thinking of buying it because you want a game similar to FA, you'll most likely be disappointed.\n\n(I may update this review as I play the game more.)","April 1","false","1.8"," 70 of 102 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","70","102","2","7"

Click and drag around one army and just right click on the other army to form them up no shift click or alt-click to do anything. They form up, and you just have to press Control + 1. Medics stay in the back and heal units, without you ordering them to.\n2. Once you get the ability to build the next set of units called frigates you can simply click on the UI and request units to rally on them, no more going back to factories and building units and then setting rally points.\n\nThis game really sets the focus on gameplay.\nYou can even do what I said for #2 with massive units called Dreadnoughts. Huge floating ships that after they kill enough units. They can upgrade their abilities to better suit your needs.\n\nI would say Stardock really did a good job on this game.

What I was not expecting was it to come so soon, and with the addition of new scenarios. Additionally, they have announced voiceovers to the campaign and continue to address almost every issue that both the playerbase and critical reviewers have had.\n\nReasons to buy this game:\n-Stardock's commitment to its players\n-Great strategic gameplay\n-Two unique factions with their own strengths/weaknesses (a third is in the making)\n-Large and small maps that play very differently\n-Viable Rush-Boom-Turtle\n-Looks amazing\n-Growing Game modes\n\nReasons to NOT buy the game:\n-If you can only get it for full price (at least I dont like to pay)\n-If your system cannot handle the game (it is very hardware intensive)\n-If you want to micro manage units (there are many things happening at once)\n-Fleshing out is still needed (although in only a month they have done a lot)\n\n\nPREVIOUS REVIEW\n\nMy outlook on this game based on the beta is very good. The development team has done one of the best jobs I have ever seen replying and responding to player feedback, criticism, and suggestions on how the game should play. Stardock has been known to support game changes/patches well into the lifespan of their games and I do not see any reason to believe that Ashes of The Singularity will be any different.\n\nGame-play has come a long way since Pre-Beta when I first purchased the game and I can only see it improving from here. Many of the thumbs down reviews came early on and in Beta when the stability of the game was still an issue. The community is also a very strong. As far as I can tell it is not toxic and although there are disagreements, it is rare to see bad reactions in discussions and forums.\n\nIf you enjoy the RTS genre then Ashes of The Singularity is a perfect game to try out. It takes inspiration from several previous games, but has its own flavor. It is easy to learn, yet hard to master and the replay-ability seems to be endless even in its current state. The dev team has laid out a specific road map going further so I can only see it getting better. The engine is brand new and therefore this game will be perfect with mods and the only thing holding it back is this generation's hardware.","March 31","true","95.6"," 36 of 47 people (77%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","77","36","47","3","0"

Ive only play 1v1 but whne it get intense the frame starts to drop, again its early access and i expected this from the get go, zomming out or at diffrent angles while small battles are happening also effect performance, so for me this is a must fix, or atleast omptimze the game as much as humanly possible.\n\nfactions:\n\n- now either i havent play enough or there just isnt enough factions, now i hope the devs are going for the planetary annliation effect wheres theres only one faction, again very early review so i maybe complete wrong, im sure someone will correct me on this if i am wrong.\n\nOther bugs/ issues:\n\n- some wierd bugs with advanced factory where a placehold titan, if im calling them right seems to overlay everything when your building one, bit wierd.\n\nNow thats over and done with, so what about the games, graphics, art style, etc. Well thats where this game shines, let me exsplain:\n\nThose who have played supreme commander will feel at home with the controls, the kind of akward camera which takes a little time to get used to, massive battles which i have yet to fully experience, wacky units, etc. the art style is simliar to planetary annilation, but less cartony which is a great choice.\n\nGraphicly with all bugs put to side the game does look good, textures could use with a little coat of paint but thats just me, been playing battlefront beta and ive beet spoilt with graphics, but its good for a mordern day rts and a ealy access game. Exsploins, unit deaths and battle effects as i call them are like a mordern day supreme commander, missle volleys are amazing, plama effects are very good, cannons firing look and feel good, you can see what i mean in videos onn youtube or on the store page.\n\nGameplay it very fun, and again its feel like superme commander mixed with planetary annilation, it is very solid and enjoyable to witness.\n\nBalance is somewhat of an issue depending how you look at it, once you start building more powerful units, your lighter earlier units are pointless, just like supreme commander and PA, this can be either a good or bad thing depending on what your play style is.\n\nOverall once this game is complete, and has a few extra factions, spit and polish to the graphics and has beenbug stompt, i can truthly say that this would be a supreme commander 3, it just feels good to play, looks goods and takes element of classic rts games and matches them so the work well together. i will be updating this as i play more.\n\n","October 22, 2015","true","9.3"," 50 of 72 people (69%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","69","50","72","4","5"

Glad i waited till the other faction was out.\n\nSimilar to supcom...push space and you can see a quick overview of the sections you need to capture. Still in beta so no tutorial or campaign but play it on beginner ai in skirmish mode and you will figure it out.\n\nPretty cool game so far, even though its just a beta. I like the upgrade system and you are constantly trying to balance spending your metal/radioactives and something called quanta (which you need for global upgrades). its cool bc radioactive is your most vital resource as you need it to build the bigger ships, resource improvement upgrades and to build quanta generators...so you have to balance your current military and size with bigger ships vs bigger dmg/health/resource or fleet capacity upgrades. more closely related to supcom forged alliance than supcom 2 (which trust me is a GOOD thing).\n\nThis game is well done, and this thing looks beautiful even on my windows 7 comp (direct x 12 gets you a few more bells and whistles but who cares..it looks beautiful and i refuse to upgrade to windows 10 until microsoft gives up on forcing you to accepa ALL updates. for a bit of improvement graphically to me its not worth it but i digress.\n\nAnyways, great game. if you like supcom forged alliance but want somethign with newer graphics, better optimization (That can actually use all 4 cores and your beefy GPU (nvidia 980 TI for me lol) then you won't be dissapointed.\n\nplayed this for only a few matches but lots of fun and I am sure once the campaign comes out and they tweak a few things this going to take the rightful place of where supcom 3 should have been.\n\n\nBuy it, especially now that its on for half price, you won't regret it :)","February 25","true","6.7"," 25 of 30 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","25","30","0","0"

It's designed for those who want to play a RTS that is more strategy focused rather than speed / micro focused. There is very little micro involved as you group most units into "meta-units", which allows them so to function as one.\n\nThe focus of this game is on the overall strategy and map control. Different units fill different roles and you can group them in ways to create different types of meta-units. Scouting, building appropriate defenses, and holding choke points are all needed in this game. As some put it, the focus is on the macro aspects of the game rather than on micro.\n\nThere are only two races (with one to be released in a later DLC) in the game and they don't differ dramatically. However, I find this works well for this game as it's focus is on balanced gameplay and strategy.\n\nThe AI is, surprisingly, quite good and can be both fun, and challenging, to play against.\n\nI don't have much bad to say about this game. My only warning is that, if you are more into micro RTS games (like Starcraft), you may not like this game.

It's a nice change from a more micro-based RTS (e.g. Starcraft 2). It definitely "feels" like an indie developed game, so if you're looking for a 100% polished title, you're better off elsewhere. For example, there's 2 factions currently and a 3rd is in the works still (as of writing this the game's been officially relseased for 2 days).\n\nThe campaign is basically a tutorial and has no voice acting. Ranked multiplayer functions similar to Hearthstone's. There's Rank 10 (worst) through 1 (best) with two or three stars per level.\n\nIt does have some cool under the hood tech though and runs well with my new R9 380 GPU (and i5 3750 CPU).\n\nOverall, I'd give it a 7/10. If you're into RTS's and want something that has a larger scale and a slower pace than SC2, give it a go. Ashes is more like chess, less like whack-a-mole.","April 3","true","17.0"," 24 of 30 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","24","30","0","0"

The units are all very similar and there isn't much tactical decision making. Expand like crazy early on, build up a giant death ball and swarm. It's a game that rewards unfettered agression as the unit cap is immense (with upgrades) and defensive structures are innefective against swarms of units (not to mention really expensive). The game despirately needs large scale AoE weapons like nukes or shield generators to make defense more effective.\n\nIt's not a bad game and I certainly haven't mastered it, but the RTS elements are shallow and unrewarding.","December 29, 2015","false","4.2"," 79 of 130 people (61%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","61","79","130","5","4"

I had hoped that after launch and some patches that the game would miraculously shape up. Sadly that is not the case. The game still looks bad, sounds bad, and plays bad.\n\nInterface - Dreadful. While everything is in the correct place, its tiny (you can make it smaller but not larger?), and full of wasted space for useless artwork. All feels like placeholder art and not final cut.\n\nSounds - Dreadful (this is a theme here). Again this feels very much like a bunch of random cheap placeholders and not something that had any serious effort put into it. I wouldnt mind it so much if there was some ambient chatter going on, some auditory feedback from your troops, but instead all your hear is endless pew pew pew and whatever the hell that BIORG sound your medics make when they leave the factory. Ugh.\n\nGameplay - Almost Dreadful. You make armies, which are essentially roaming warbands of tiny things on your screen that look meaningless until you start spitting out dreadnoughts. You move your blobs from one target to another, hoping you have more guns than they do or luckily a better combination of units to counter theirs. The strategic layer of capturing nodes seems wonderful at first, but then it becomes such a massive chore due to the fact that you must babysit your chain very carefully or a sneaky enemy will break through your lines/frontier and cut the chain. So you turtle, keeping it all tightly buttoned up, leaving no holes. Fun at first, and then it gets extremely annoying.\n\nA lot of problems would go away if the game didnt require such a fantastic amount of micro management. Without any auditory feedback as to whats happening you are constantly checking all over the map for red things on your radar, your units being attacked (they dont tell you they are), enemy units bombing your resources etc. You simply cannot just enjoy a battle as a lack of focus elsewhere can be crippling.\n\nOverall - It could be good, but it would require serious overhauling of how the game looks and functions. The game is highly reminiscent of stardocks old offering, Elemental, whereby the first game was incredibly weak, but two followup revisions (Fallen Enchantress) eventually fleshed out the look and the formula. This is what this game needs, a makeover, or two.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOriginal Early Access Review:\n\nBeta 2 early impressions: My initial review is that this game is still very rough and incomplete. Total Annihilation a decade+ ago looked better. Why? Because it was much more clear what I was looking at. Here while everything has far more detail when zoomed in, zoomed out it all looks like nonsense and you need to play zoomed out to see the battlefield. As is this game does not clearly present to you what units you have, what units youre lacking (due to being destroyed and thus knowing what to rebuild), and what is happening far away from your attention. Buildings getting attacked? Hope you noticed the color change on the minimap as thats the only thing conveying useful information at this time.\n\nThe other big killer of fun and happiness are orbital weapons. Got an army? Want to atttack the enemy? Poof, your army is gone. Orbital weapon took it out. You cant move out of the blast range fast enough. Only way to avoid it is to turtle extremely slowly building anti-orbital buildings along your path. And if it wasnt for the orbital weapons, siege dreadnoughts that wipe out anything that isnt a dreadnought essentially guarantees that in the endgame you will build just two things: aircraft to harrass the enemy and dreadnoughts. Anything smaller need not apply as it gets wiped out instantly.\n\nThe game however is promising and very much in the category of "diamond in the rough".","February 25","false","10.9"," 71 of 116 people (61%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","61","71","116","3","4"

First, about myself and some "qualifications"\n\n* Hit Legend (#14) in Ashes after ~65 games (~65% win rate)\n* Top-X World Sedna Player (Demigod) way back when\n* ~500 hours of Dawn of War II 2v2 - Tryanid\n* Plat League of Legends Season 3/4\n* Diamond in Duelyst past 4 seasons\n* ~40 hours of casual Sins of a Solar Empire MP with friends\n* Lots of physical card/board games\n\nSo, i do have some prior video game expierence, though it's been a very long time since i've played any RTS games and i haven't been super-seriuos with an RTS game really, ever. Obviously, since i played enough Ashes of the Singularity to hit Legend, i probably enjoy the game, so there's going to be some bias here. Here's what i think is the best reasons to play Ashes:\n\n1. You're looking for new-IP RTS game with a fresh Multiplayer Community (you don't want to be stomped by Koreans in SC2 or play against people with 1,000 hours in Sins of a Solar Empire).\n\n2. You enjoy squad-based combat similar to Company of Heroes or Dawn of War II\n\n3. You're looking for a shorter game (~20-35 minutes including queue + loading screen)\n\n4. You want a game that will have developer support for many years - hopefully!\n\n5. Contrary to what others may say, it does actually support turtle/boom/rush pretty well.\n\nThe fact of the matter is anyone can be good at Ashes. i haven't played this style of an RTS game ... ever, really. And yet i was able to hit Legend in just shy of 16 hours played in MultiPlayer. i didn't play Beta. i didn't really reasearch the game. i beat the campaign, played a few games against the AI until i had a good starting build order i was happy with, checked out the subreddit and read the tips there, and that was it. Sure, i have expierence with other video games, but calling me "try hard" isn't really a fair label, my average game time is "only" 90 minutes a day. So if you want to play a game where you, honest to god, have a pretty fair shot at climbing to the top, Ashes is a fantastic pick-up.\n\nIn fact, "brewing" your own builds and strategies is extremely rewarding in this game because there's very little "netdecking". There's only a few Twitch streams, none very popular. There isn't a lot of strategy online either. It's really on you to innovate the meta! Trust me, i climbed specifically by playing anti-meta builds.\n\nThe "meta-unit" combat of Ashes is fantastic. There's a few difficulties, and they are really obnoxious, but once you understand the limitations of the system, it's really incredible. Squad-based combat that is pretty intelligent is really fantastic! A huge amount of play is focused on macro-based combat, rather than split-second micro-mechanics.\n\nAshes is a pretty quick game, but nothing else to really add there.\n\nFinally, while Stardock has had a few nasty releases (Demigod, Elemental: War of Magic), they absolutely have a huge amount of support and both Demigod and EWoM were great games after additional support. Ashes has had an incredible release, in my opinion. It's had great reviews on many reputable websites, and it's bundled with a ton of video cards so we should be getting a lot of fresh "free" blood for at least the next few months. The development team is talktative, willing to discuss, and willing to adapt.\n\nOf course, there's some bad parts:\n\n1. Multiplayer matchmaking is borked. Unlike very-popular games such as League of Legends, Hearthstone, etc, you'll get matched against much worse/better players very frequently! This is a pretty big negative, but will be fixed as the MP community gets larger. Honestly, i think Stardock should hide the Rankings during the loading screen because people go on tilt way too much. There could be some sort of "Advantage!" indicator that indicates the higher-ranked player instead.\n\n2. The audio effects are extremely repetitive. The background music is fantastic!!! But the sound effects... you'll get really sick of them. Oh so sick of them.\n\n3. If, for some reason, you'll looking for a fantastic story-telling campaign, it's not here yet. While i was perfectly happy with the campaign and thought it was a great seqway into learning the game and taught you everything you needed to know... it's not a campaign most people would want to share with their friends and talk about over dinner. Most RTS games don't even "have" a campaign - Blizzard games aside - so i'm not sure why this is such a negative, but some people are really upset about that.\n\n4. For being a supposedly super-cutting-edge game, the graphics seem mediocre. That doesn't mean they are bad... but they are not super-inspiring and you won't be blown away. They are simple hovercraft, which makes sense if we are talking about mass-produced soulless robot entities, but it does seem like a step-back from Sins which had extremely well-done graphics and was also produced by Stardock. It sounds like a lot of this was a budget problem, which means it might be fixed in the future (i really hope that Expansion #2 will "reboot" the races and have brand new textures/particles).\n\n5. The AI is too hard for some people, and there's no campaign-slider to make it easier. While i didn't struggle beating the campaign, a lot of other people do. It's sort of funny... Stardock makes a "good" AI then people lose to it and the players get mad. Some people say that the computer is "still cheating" because it clicks faster than a human. Anyway, the AI is pretty good! Which is somehow a bad thing.\n\nAnyway, there's my quick list of pros-and-cons and what i think should really drive your decisions. If strong lore, voice-acting, good-sounding explosions and fast-fair MP matches are absolute-must-haves, you should probably pass on Ashes. If you're looking for a new, innovative MP RTS game that will scale for many years, while allowing you to have an actual, personal interaction with the meta, insulated from "net deckers"... Ashes is a great choice. The close 30-minute games with huge armies and orbital strikes are such an amazing source of fun! It's honest-to-god fun and fulfilling, not that "oh thank god it's over" feeling you get from other games.\n","April 11","true","65.4"," 40 of 61 people (66%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","66","40","61","7","0"

I like RTS games with stream economy. Especially comes alive for me in MP. But with a campaign, scenarios and good AI to play on plenty of available skirmish maps there is a fair amount to do for SP lovers too (and I play them too). Especially as you can create your own maps and scenarios; you can find a guide on how to do it here: http://www.moddb.com/games/ashes-of-the-singularity\n\nFor those curious about performance I run the game on a i7 4790k with a 970 FTW and 32GB of RAM (overkill for me but someone else uses the computer for video editing). I run the game @ 1920x1200 (16:10 ftw :)) on Extreme settings with AA turned up to 8x from the default 4x. A game will start with about 60+ FPS but in big battles etc. will go into the 40s, which for me on an RTS is fine. And it looks gooood :) (and perhaps more importantly no sim slow down!). A friend is able to run it on High settings with a 7970/280x.\n\nHmm, not a big believer in reviews in general as you don't know me and you have no idea if my likes align with yours. If you want to know specifics I can edit this and go into it.\nFor what it's worth though the game is a lot of fun for me, though not perfect. Most of the areas I want the game to improve on all seem to be in the pipeline though. When we get things like navy, 12 player map support, another faction and smaller things like wreckage and reclaiming then I think this will go from being a very decent fun RTS to a genuinely great RTS to be played for many years to come.","April 2","true","162.9"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","77","17","22","3","0"

I was excited to see these features presented from a 2016 perspective (I skipped Planetary Annihilation because it was kind of expensive, and because the unit scale on the planets threw me off).\n\nFirst Impression\n\nI was pretty lost. Normally I'd go right for the campaign, and then if that was hard I'd find a tutorial. Both of these things were missing from the Early Access, which I have 0 beef with. Instead you get an online walkthrough, which worked well enough for my purposes. On the second attempt, I ran the benchmark first (as instructed, and was pleasantly surprised to see my framrate stayed aboce 30 for even the most intense scenes). Also, the music and graphics for the loading screen are very pleasant (though I doubt you started reading this review to hear that), they both serve to remind that this is a very current game with a lot of potential.\n\nFirst Battle\n\n(First Battle Where I Understood What To Do *) Most of the standard RTS tropes are in there and implemented well. I had no issue with unit control, althouth this is where I have my first complaint. Maybe it's because I haven't played enough, or maybe it's because I wasn't wearing my glasses, but I found the units hard to tell apart, and so are the structures. With the graphics being as powerful as they are, I'd like to think units and structures could be a little more distinct (to me they're all sci-fi blobs), but honestly this doesn't really take away from the experience. Idle engineers are on F1, and when you're building a huge army to act as one meta-unit, you stop giving a ♥♥♥♥ about it's actual unit composition so long as there's a little of everything. Harking back to SupCom, I liked how some units walked on 2, 4, 6, or 8 legs, some hovered, some flew, some floated (?), and some had tracks. Here, they fly or hover. This doesn't even qualify as a complaint, it's merely a gripe from a die hard.\n\nThe battle basically resulted in me spawning a few small armies, a few big armies, and then overrunning them with a hord. Two big compliments here. I love love love the AI and how it controls armies. I feel a little removed, but it's cool to see your subordinates take up the fight. Another nice touch was the resource system, and how it lends itself to map exploration and territory control. Essentially, nodes in an almost gridlike pattern are scattered across the map. Controlling nodes grants resources, and exploring the grid eventually leads to pronounced frontlines as teams fight over strategic nodes.\n\nHow would I Improve it / Should you buy it?\n\n(What would I add from SupCom / Should You Buy It? *) Let me say that I picked it up 50% off, and I probably wouldn't buy an early access game in any situation without that stipulation. That said, it's already a lot of fun, and I look forward to seeing this game evolve. I have very high hopes for it, and I expect it to do reasonably well as it's a nice new take on a genre that could use some invigorating. NOW, here's a couple things I'd like see. Dreadnoughts are your Big MFs; take a lot of resources, does a lot of damage, has a lot of hit points, etc. I know they do different things (there's three to choose from), but I don't know the difference and tbh I don't care. None of them were -captivating-. This would be the only catergory where I could say I expected bigger things from this game. I was gonna go off about how I want more and bigger dreadnoughts, more frigates, more units, maybe superdreadnoughts, etc, but I think I can summarize it this way.\nThe units don't excite me. This could be a beta issue, maybe there's more on the way, but right now they all just seem like unimaginitive sci-fi RTS stereotypes, and the Big MFs aren't big enough. They all just shoot different coloured lasers or rockets.\n\nTL;DR\n\nThis is a really great game, especially considering it's stil in beta, but I'd like it more if it were more like Supreme Commander.","February 26","true","10.6"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","15","19","0","1"

Given that it is a game that is released with the near-certainty of extended ongoing support, this is... satisfactory.\nThe current meta-unit (armies) implementation in v1.1 does most of the job, although it is missing nuances such as stances (aggressive/skirmishing/etc. akin to Homeworld-series and Dark Reign setups). There are many improvements in the details, making armies one good way to remove the need to set specific unit behvaiours as they are produced.\nArmies eliminate hair-splitting nuisances like coordinating air units with ground armies when you are lazy, and reinforcements (equivalent to Sins fleets).\nThe support units within the army will automatically focus on what they do best, rather than e.g. rushing into battle while abilities are on cooldown (ala Hoshikos & several other support cruisers in Sins Rebellion with autoattack left on.)\nSnipers will stay ranged, and at times kite (similar to AI-War autokite ranges)\nUnits like melee frigates will generally sit and guard ranged units in the same army rather than swarm in. This last one is contentional, and is one of the areas where army stances will help. Some players have complained about it validly, because zerg-rushing is sometimes the best choice. Given the game meta, it is not as common to see siege situations where you actually want to wait for artillery to do its job. There are things that are desired but missing, like attaching engineers with automated instructions to upgrade or fortify captured regions - one of the tasks that is still very click-heavy (SupCom extractor mechanics... -_-). They auto-form armies, which is usually good. I would often wish to split an army into two (AI War), detach forward scouts or filter-select them (AI War again), and skirmishing/i.e. attempt to draw enemies into concaves (Starcraft micro). These are the sort of things you shouldn't need to micro as the overall commander (rather than commander of that army) ..I suppose those kind of improvement  will come in time and with the relevant maps.\n\n= = =\nThe other-bit about multicore usage is particularly relevant for AI. While performance is generally GPU-bound until you obtain a beastly pair of GPUs, adding 5 AIs in a match will pretty much guarantee big slowdowns on a standard desktop PC. In v1.1, the game doesn't particularly care about the CPU's max performance (nor do most programs for that matter): you add the AI, and the AI will spawn all the threads that it needs down to every last turret on a cruiser.\n\nSo it's not meant to be a game for massive AI skirmishes until the average desktop has 16+ cores. It's something that I'd be curious to test in a supercluster setting... >_>\n\nThe hardware will eventually catch up.\n= = =\nIn the mean time, I think it is worth an investment to tell the developers and the overall gaming community that the RTS-genre can be other things than micro-fests (which should be called istead real-time tactics). The devs are continuing to add maps and units (niche-filling units), and are on-track to release DLCs that won't need you to keep buying to stay abreast of the MP community (Wargame series...). That is, players without DLC content will be able to play with players that do.","May 4","true","8.3"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","16","21","0","0"

I really want to love this more than I do. As a huge Sins of a Solar Empire fan, I jumped on this game thinking there would be some of the gameplay style that I've grown to love with SoaSE; the "stately" pace of the game, the enormous and immersive world, the expansive upgrade/tech tree, the grand strategy, etc. While some of that is present, I just can't seem to "get" the game. Maybe it's because I've gotten too old and jaded to really enjoy faster paced games, or maybe it's because I simply cannot reconcile where this game fits in with the RTS genre. I played Total Annihilation and Supreme Commander back in the day and enjoyed them and Ashes seems like a spiritual successor to those titles (much more like them than, say, Starcraft or AoE/AoM).\n\nAll of that said, I'm recommending this game...not because I love it (because I'm coming to terms with the fact that I don't). I'm recommending this game because it is graphically stunning, the AI is incredible, the maps are varied and seemingly well thought-out, and the developer has shown dedication and affection for and to the title. This game will resonate very well with TA and SC fans, but beware if you're looking for an RTS where you can turtle and focus on defense rather than offense (SoaSE, SC, AoE/AoM, etc.).\n\nDon't get me wrong, I will play this title from time to time. And I will continue to support Stardock because they are simply my favorite developer, but I guess this one just isn't for me.","April 9","true","20.2"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","11","12","0","0"

At first glance, it looks like it's a Supreme Commander or Planetary Annihilation type of game.   It's not, so don't go into this expecting that.   Ashes is definitely it's own game and that imo is better for the genre.   To me, Ashes is a hybrid between SupCom and traditional base builders like Starcraft or Grey Goo.    Although you can mass huge armies, the base building and resources are far more reserved than SupCom.    You won't be spamming turrets, and base defenses while building massive armies.\n\nResources force you to expand around the map, plus they have a domination type game mode mechanic where you have to capture certain generator points on the map.   Whoever can hold most of the points until they go critical mass wins.   So it's a dual win condition...the generator points or just wipe out the enemy.\n\nThe units themselelves are outstanding and impressive.   It's like having a space or naval fleet on the ground.   You have frigates, larger cruisers, then the massive dreadnaughts.   In addition, you have orbital abilities that can be researched and used as well as a unit upgrade system.   Both factions are very unique and not just mirror's of each other.    A huge upgrade for the game is the fact the units micro themselves.   So you don't have to worry about them if you need to concentrate on another part of the map.\n\nThe campaign is very good and challenging.   It took me longer than the SupCom 2 campaign.   Overall this is a must buy imo for any RTS fan.   And best of all, the developers are continuing to update and add to the game.","May 6","true","28.6"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

The bombers came in and my screen was locked in place.  Unable to move, go back, just stuck in place.\n\nI feel like there was a lot of good effort done for the skirmish and multiplayer. However, it came at the cost of the single player.  In addition, there are no characters, no personalities, and virtually no story line.

Instead I get a text box with names that I can barely read.

I would just recommend either they fix the story line or use the revenue to make a good story line for the next game.  If they do decide to add/change the story line, at the very least just add a voice over.  That is all I really need.  Supreme Commander had a really good voice over and cut scenes.

I often don't use the end game units, the dreadnoughts. Which is a shame as I love those units but most multiplayer games are only 10-15 minutes.

I just don't care a lot about fancy graphics or what not.\n\nI go this game because they made single player AI one of their main sellings points. And I usually don't do online multiplayer, for RTS games anyways. So I went into this with the expectation of playing skirmishes mainly. That said I'm currently playing mostly multiplayer. So I guess singleplayer really must suck?\nQuite the opposite. The AI really is comparably good. From what I know, the vast majority of players are at a level where the AI doesn't need any advantages whatsoever to challenge them. They even added another difficulty level for people to get used to the playing at 100%. But of course there are also the higher difficulties and all but the hardest one have been beaten by players in a 1 vs 1 setting.\nAnd then there's multiplayer. What surprised me the most was that skill versus the AI really does translate to skill versus players. Of course there are differences and everything, but if you're good at beating the AI you're probably also good at beating people. And that's not as obvious as it might sound, seeing how in many RTS I've played the high difficulty singleplayer experience was just so different from actual multiplayer that you could be the king of singleplayer and still suck versus people. And that's a good thing because it makes it a lot easier to start playing multiplayer casually without getting stomped all the time.\n\nNow, not everything is flowers and rose petals.\nThe campaign isn't really story driven. Sure, there is a story, but it didn't make me care about things. A lot of people seemed to find some missions really challenging, but it's all very beatable. That said the devs have announced to rework the campaign, make the difficulty adjustable and work on the story. Also add more content.\nFor skirmish there's really not a lot to complain about I feel.\nAs for multiplayer... I obviously like it. The queue times are okay, it just sometimes happens that there aren't enough high ranked players in the queue. So sometimes high ranked players get matched against low ranked players if the system couldn't find a more suitable opponent. It has been getting a lot better, though, as the number of players increased. It is my impression, however, that while there are not a lot of "mid tier players". At least I barely get matched with any.\n\nAs a finishing note I just wanted to state that the devs are very active on the steam forums, have constantly adapted and improved their game (post release) until now. And I fully expect them to keep doing what they're doing. They announced new units , a replay and observer feature, a polished campaign and a lot more things. And they delived what they promised in the past.","May 11","true","129.9"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","13","17","0","0"

Some people think the lack of types of units is a good thing, but it killed the game for me. There was not enough variety in unit types or maps for me. The game was advertised as having the biggest maps in a RTS to date, but most of the maps "feel" smaller than maps in say, Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance. There's no varied terrain (probably a side effect of the procedural generation) - everything is hilly mountains and canyons, in either white (snow), green (grassy), brown (dirt/desert) or some mix of the three. There are no naval units or water battles.\n\nHonestly, for a large scale RTS fix, go buy SC:FA instead.

I definitely let out a sigh of relief when I saw that Stardock definitely recognized that the longevity of RTS games comes from an active multiplayer community and took steps to insure people would enjoy the experience. Offering all of the features you should expect from multiplayer features, this game has the framework to last for quite some time.\nThe graphics are quite good in this game, actually slightly better than I was expecting. Offering a decent zoom both in and out, the game was well crafted in this regard. Also, I noted no framerate stutters or drops no matter the army size that I was employing.. whether it was 50 or 500, the game didn’t even blink. Well optimized, the game stayed very smooth whether I was trouncing an opponent or getting my butt thoroughly kicked, I was assured of no framerate loss the whole time.\nIn regards to the story though, well… it’s a bit boring to be honest. It definitely felt tacked on, what with the text only in-game briefs and the odd audio loss during the spoken dialogue options… but that’s unfortunately pretty standard fare for RTS’s these days. However the campaign is a complete one and, depending on skill level or AI difficulty settings could take over 20 hours or more to finish.

Personaly I enjoy this aspect as opposed to the lightnight fast actions of Starcraft 2. A choice by the player may be the wrong one, and an out of place army does not move quickly. Conversly, if you catch an oponent overextending you can create an opening in their defenses.\n\n-Active development\nThe developers of this game are doing a good job of supporting and communicating about their game to the players.

As of now, the maps don't have distinct differences in height except for mountain ranges which are simply unpassable.\n\n-Unit variety is somewhat limited, with only 2 factions in the game, each of them has 3-4 viable frigates, 3-4 cruisers, 3 aircraft, and 3 dreadnoughts. While this sounds like a fair amount of units, I've won a number of games by simply making one of each on repeat and throwing my units at my opponent, but perhaps this changes at the upper tiers of ranked (I am only rank 6)\n\n-Only 2 factions at launch. This wouldn't be so much of a problem if the factions weren't so similar. Each faction has essentially the same number of units that fulfill essentially the same roles, with some variations (e.g. the PHC only has AA on cruisers, while the Substrate has AA frigates)\n\n-Still a little buggy, but I expected as much (what game isn't these days?)\n\n\nOverall a great RTS experience that I will be playing for quite a while.","April 6","true","25.3"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

Base building: check. Multiplayer, both ranked and co-op: check. Pretty good non-cheating AI: check.\n\nThis game is not the whole package. It's a solid foundation from a game development company that actively supports its games for years. There is a lot of room for improvement, and the dedicated development staff to make it happen. Take modding, for example. It is possible to tweak many numbers in the game. It is possible to create maps and custom scenarios. It is not, however, possible to share mods and maps on Steamworks or play the mods in multiplayer...YET! The modding capability is currently minimal, but shows promise of being rich. Yeah the UI could (and will) see some improvements, the units look and move very similarly, the tech tree is a little boring, and there's not much life and character in the maps and campaign...YET! The developers have a history of listening to, interacting with, and soliciting ideas from the community. Some of my own feedback offered during the alpha stage was pulled into the game.\n\nDespite the foundational state of the game, it's actually fun anyway. A focus on macro, not so much micro, means you are conquering the map at a higher more strategic level. The AI actually controls behavior of your units within armies in a fairly intelligent way, so you don't have to micro them. Beneath the initial facade of "more units = win" is a strategic depth involving army compositions. This means a skilled player can adapt the makeup of his armies to fight using devastating and cost-efficient counter-armies. Combined with strategies for map control, scouting, and harassment, there is a pretty high skill cap. And yet there is a pretty shallow learning curve too, at least for fans of other RTS games.\n\nIn summary, yes I recommend you play this game. Enjoy the things you like, and offer constructive criticism for the things you don't. This game will get better over time, especially with community support.","April 7","true","108.7"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Of course it does borrrow elements from other games (there really isn't anything that is 100% new) but the way that it takes these known quantities and puts them together is certainly unique. What I like best is the slow, methodical gameplay matched with the huge scale of the game. At first I thought that the game was just to slow, but once you get on a four player map the speed is perfect. Much faster and it would become unmaneagable. The speed also forces you to think ahead since the time between ordering an army to an area and said army reaching this area is to long to reward fast reactions to enemy movements. You already need a plan to counter your opponents strategy and the units in place to do that. The game is still fluid, but it is certainly methodical which I like. Also, the AI is tough. I gaurantee that you will find a difficulty setting that will crush you. Army building is also fascinating. The mix of units in a given army will determine what it can best do and these units actually act together as a cohesive whole. For those of you who played Battle for Middle Earth II and its expansion, this means no more calvary rushing into pikemen because you left them on their own for a whole 2 seconds. Overall I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes RTS. It is challenging and rewarding. I can hardly wait to see how this game evolves through expansion and updates.\n\nP. S. For those of you with a R9 380 the max non-custom setting you can run at is "Standard" at 35 FPS. What you need to do is turn the setting to "Extreme" and then disable MSAA and turn the terrain shading to low and the textures to mid. This will give you about 45 FPS and the graphical quality will be much better.

Might be the best RTS I've played since Supreme Commander.\nTL;DR - if you're into the unit special abilities and micro-management (think C&C RA 3) then this is not for you. If you're into the larger-scale conflicts, moving entire armies around for key resource control (think Supreme Commander 1) then this is worth a shot.\n\n\nVery focused on the macro level - the Army system (where armies of units grouped together are controlled as one) messes up occasionally (sent my medics in on the front lines, got torn to shreds by defences) but generally coordinates my forces about as effectively as I would end up doing myself. But it's utility is not in it's micromanagement of unit positions. You can see all the units in the group and ORDER REINFORCEMENTS. They will be added to your factory build queues, and will find their own way over to the army and fall in rank when complete. I think this might be my favourite RTS mechanic of all time. Seriously Devs, you're the best <3.\n\nUnit diversity is OK. Nothing quite as bonkers as SupCom, but with simplicity comes ability to focus on the macro again. Don't have to worry about building 30xT1 interceptors to hold off the enemy 5xT3 bombers. Just think "more fighters" and that's it.\nBut equally I like bonkers. I like spending 2 hours building an experimental artillery piece capable of wiping out entire planets. Here it's just Rocket Defence, Gun Defence, AA Defence, RADAR Tower. It gets the job done, but doesn't make me dance with joy.\n\nSpeaking of bombers, uh, they're pretty good. As in I built 25 Bomber wings (resource stalling all the way SupCom style, great fun) and proceeded to carpet bomb all 3 of my AI opponents HQs. Just radar scan, Orbital Strike to weaken them & remove AA around the Nexus, Bombers in, repeat. And I won! Yay!\nI'm yet to try out the harder difficulties (been playing Me+2AI v 3AI on medium) and see how sophisticated their AI gets, but it should be fun and I'm looking forward to it.\n\nAll in it's a brilliant RTS so far. Glad I bought it. Will update with more stuff when I've sunk another dozen hours in or whatever.\n\nEDIT 1 - Performance - Forgot to mention, this one does have a few bugs. Initial load time is HORRIBLE - might have to stick it on the SSD some time. However I've been perfectly stable once in game, even with medium-large unit groups in close proximity laser gun lightshow combat. So it's a little rough around the edges, but works fine where it counts. Runs on my mid-range gaming potato fairly well, but users with older machines should (as always) be wary.","April 27","true","6.5"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

This isn't to say the release is bad, in the case of Ashes it's already a fantastic game, it's just going to grow a great deal over time.  It gets them a lot of undeserved grief as people play a game that will continue to evolve and expand, potentially for several years or longer, decide it wasn't quite good enough to have a long shelf life, and write it off without ever finding out just how long the company actually supports their products and how fantastic they end up being.\n\nThis game is NOT Supreme Commander.  There are no shield bubbles, there is no strategic artillery, this isn't even an open map game design.  It's all about taking and holding territory, like Dawn of War, if Dawn of War allowed for massive troop counts on horrendously large maps.  It is however a large scale game designed to scale up with technology.  The two sides are also very different, so don't get bummed out that there are only two.\n\nDreadnoughts and Orbitals are the core of combat.\n\nDreadnoughts start out being able to wipe out horrendous amounts of troops, and they level up, gaining bonuses and special abilities, like armor piercing, self repair.  Much like Experimentals from Supreme Commander, they can seriously wreck the party.\n\nOrbitals are one time ability purchases, that get more expensive every time you use them, paid for by a spammable income producing building that also pays for research upgrades.  They're a diverse array of impacts, from simple vision and dropping an engineer at a remote location, to fleet trashing orbital bombardment.\n\nThe rest of your power comes in the form of an excellent array of defensive structures, far less complicated than Supreme Commander, but very effective and very different between the two sides, and the fleets of frigates and cruisers you build up for the bulk of your forces.\n\nIt's an excellent strategy game, great for multiplayer, with game length and scope being highly variable from small maps to large ones.  The single player campaign isn't too great, more of a tutorial that pushes you to play different ways to accomplish your goals, but skirmishes are fantastic.  You can do anything from a short half hour game to a day long slog as you war your way across a massive arena.  At present I think Supreme Commander is still the better game, but engine wise there's simply no comparison to the scale of gameplay you can achieve, and the potential is there to dethrone it big time with the planned expansions and features Stardock has put out.  Odds are you can actually mod it into a better game already, and more capabilities are planned there as well.","April 3","true","49.9"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

Like many, I was looking for a successor to Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance. However, despite its apparent similarities, this is a very different game, and that is a good thing.\n\nFirst off, above all else, this games strongest asset is Stardock. They are an amazing developer and their community involvement is superb. Constantly on the lookout for community feedback and addressing player concerns in the forums, they really care about their player base and making a good game. My appreciation for this aspect of their development process alone warrants this positive review, but it also helps that the game is also legitimately fun to play.\n\nTurtling is a strategy that can often be a go-to for many players in RTS games, and to an extent, Ashes tries to make it a less-than-viable strategy. To win, you must accumulate resources, and to do this, you must exert as much control over as much of the map as possible. That being said, from beginning to end the game doesn't feel like a mad zerg rush to capture points, but more like you are waging a large-scale war on multiple fronts. The quanta resource mechanic is very interesting. You have your two main resources which are metal and radioactives which are used to construct units, where quanta is accumulated over time by constructing production buildings exclusively for that resource. Quanta can then be spent on anything from unit upgrades like health and damage to special abilities like calling in extra units or orbital strikes. Do you focus your resources entirely on unit production? Or do you bank on the long game by increasing the effectiveness of your units or maintaining a quanta reserve to blow on special abilities at critical moments?\n\nI rarely write game reviews as I'm generally too lazy to put in the effort that I feel the games I love warrant. However, I made a special case for this game as I feel the developers deserve as much positive feedback as they can get. They have a passion for game development, and it shows. If you are looking for a unique large-scale strategy game and/or to support honest, genuine game developers, buy Ashes of the Singularity.","May 13","true","16.6"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

I poured at least a couple hundred hours into Command and Conquer Generals and probably a hundred into AoE 3 back in the day, but other than that I guess you could call me an average player.\n\nSecond of all, the game's graphics are simply amazing especially when you have dozens of units fighting at the same time which does strain your system. With that being said, you better have a bangin' rig or else you might as well call this game Ashes of Microsoft PowerPoint because sometimes I’ll get ~15 FPS in HUGE firefights (30+ units).** However, don't be so worried if you're in the long run for the development of this game though. Based on what I've read, I believe Stardock is one of the few publishers you can trust to actually finish and present an optimized product. This isn't one of those Steam Early Access cash grab games developed by some guy in his mom's basement that leaves it to rot after a few months. It appears to me these developers actually have the resources to finish and update the game throughout its life cycle.\n\n======\n\nIn this game, your objective is to capture generators throughout the map. I’m somewhat on the edge on this as I prefer a simpler RTS where the main objective is to just wipe out the enemy and win. It’s a faster pace game in the sense that you have almost “micro manage” your units to keep production and defend many generators at once. It’s a slower pace game in the sense that the units move very slowly from point A to B; which I’ll detail next.\nTo me, the units you control move a bit slower than I’d like. That isn’t necessarily a bad thing, but I’m much more used to faster paced RTS games. If that’s something you don’t like, they’ve recently updated the game as of today that increases a lot of different unit’s speed and there’s a lot of discussion in the community around the unit speeds that suggests even more change in the future.\n\nWould I suggest this to a friend? Right now, probably not. Unless you know Stardock’s work, it’s hard to convince someone to cough up $40 (20% off sale right now) for a work in progress game. I don’t know if I suck, the AI are gods, or there’s a really high skill cap but I’m struggling to easily beat the “Easy AI” so I wouldn’t say this game is something you could just pick up and frag out on. If you want to be good, there’s a lot of stuff you have to learn otherwise you’re someone who’s neck deep in RTS.\nIf you’re someone who outright loves strategy games, Ashes of the Singularity is definitely an up and coming game. If you’re worried about it being an early access, unoptimized game (rightfully so) then keep it on your radar because I expect Ashes to be an even better game once they’ve fully finished the game.\n\n\n**Running on GTX 780, i7-3770k, 8GB memory, installed on an SSD\n","October 28, 2015","true","13.9"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","77","10","13","3","0"

You can have tons of units on a massive map all battling it out and it still runs smooth. It also looks beautiful.\n\nThe campaign is nothing to write home about and feels tacked on, however this game is all about multiplayer and skirmish. The AI is really good, my friends and I would fight against AIX Sorian in supcom and the Ashes AI is much better and more interesting to play against. Myself and two friends against several AI = hours of fun :)\n\nIs it Forged Alliance or even Supcom 3? No it's not, it still needs unit balancing and more maps, but it's a fantastic RTS which is still getting regular updates from the devs. From what I understand it will continue to for the foreseeable future. It has a great core built on a really great engine and given the good on going work by devs is getting better and better.\n\nThe game is worth the money now and in a few more months will be so even more. If you like RTS this is a must for your library.\n\nMy top requests for this game in no particular order\n\nMore hot key controls for selecting units, e.g. in that "other game" I like being able to press ctrl-z on a unit and have it select all units of that type. Maybe I am missing something but I found it frustrating trying to double click an aircraft which is flying round and round so I could select all of that type.\n\nMore ways of quickly moving units around the map, transport aircraft, teleportation? Not sure what the right answer is but I found that my factories and construction buildings built early in the game quickly became useless as they were so far from the front line.

It can be played at a steady pace of you can throw wave after wave -hey their disposable, sure it says so in the game.\n\nThis games draws a few things from some of the classics, Dawn of war and Company of hero's. Start on easy and enjoy the thrill of 3000 units worth of troops on a large(ish) map. Then play fast and furious.\n\nThe game is not without minor faults. Some times the difficulty goes from ridiculously easy   to unbelievably hard in the single player. I cannot find an option to set the level and this may put a lot of beginners off.\n\nSOUND - the sound is all over the place some times. I turned the music down but the voice of the AI is quite often booming. But then in the rather nice looking cuts sequences, I strain to hear what they are even saying.\n\nGame play is fluid but may get a little jerky near the end of the game with thousands (YES Thousand of units worth of troops). There is some optimization to be done I am sure after a few months it could well be smooth like butter, Which is how I like to defeat my enemy.\n\nThe AI is really good but sometimes just crushes you, till you get the hang of the game.\nThe visuals are pretty good but come on if you're admiring them that much 40 enemy units have passed you by and are at your base ( Muhahah).\n\nThe single player campaign is way too short for my liking I was expecting 12 to 15 PER faction but we got 12 and that was it.\n\nThe Dev's seem to be very active and they are adding things to this area, extra play modes etc. So things can only get better. Well apart from the enemy things look pretty bleak for them.\n\nHardware wise this can be a hard hitter but there are handy indicators to give you a clue. It doesn't say CRAZY on the preset for nothing and will take 10 - 15 fps. This can be the difference between playable and a jerk fest. But you are going to try it once- why because there is a big phrase in the middle and it says benchmark and you will want to try this.\n\nHowever there are enough tabs in the setting to fine tune the graphics setting so no worries there.\n\nIf you are a RTS head this is the kind of game you will come back too time and again. I am a tiny bit addicted to it at the moment and seem to have at least 4 or 5 games spread out during the day.\n\nI started playing on easy and watched the AI on my team build up, it is a really good way to learn the in's and outs of the game. SO my advice if your new to this play the tutorial and then start a 4 player 2 vs 2 AI and watch your AI team mate and you will soon get the hang of it. IF you have played some of the other top RTS game then you pretty much know how to play this already.\n\nLast but not least - Don't go easy the enemy had it coming - honest guv.","April 3","true","267.5"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

But this is one of those games where the more you play, the more you love it. First off, i LOVE the UI. Its not ugly nor is it hard to navigate. I love all the different colors in the UI and find it easy to find what im looking for. Second, the meta-unit army thing is really the best thing about this game. Ive always hated microing my units during battles. All i want to do is select a glob of units and tell em to attack. All the unit micro is handled in this game which allows you to have multiple massive battles across the map. The medics will go heal any unit in the army and the artillery units stay in the back. Its soo great not having to micro all that. Third, if you loved Sins (i do) then you will love this game. Instead of planets you get power generators to capture which have resource plots connected to said generators. Fourth, its NOT supcom 3! The only thing this game has that is similar to supcom is the emphasis on massive battles. That stupid economy in supcom FA is NOT in this game.  Fifth, battles can range from tiny maps to massive ones. So if you just want to pop in and play a match for a half hour you can or if you want to sit and have a massive hour or 2 hour long war with some buddies you can.\n\nNow for the bad stuff:\n1) I would like 1 more faction. Im ok with just 2 but id like at least 1 more.\n2) Needs a few more units for each faction\n\nI would have to say that im going to playing a LOT of this game and that ive just deleted supcom FA because of this game. One of the best ground based RTS games ive played in a while. id have to give it a 9/10.","March 5","true","21.4"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","73","11","15","3","1"

What a title.\n\nAshes is an RTS that consists of massive scale battles on several maps, that vary in size, and up to 6 players (With it being extended to 12) These maps take place on several types of planets, and majority of them are designed extremely well. The object of the game is simple: Mass an army of hundreds of units, potentially thousands, and go wreak havoc upon your enemies. Does the game require strategy? Yes, to a certain degree, although that could be improved.\n\nYou could say the game is basic in It's approach, and it is, but It's extremely fun.\n\nThere are currently two Factions, with a third incoming. PHC = Pro-Human Coalition. Substrate = Sentient A.I.\n\nEach of these two factions play very differently from each other, with unique unit/structure designs to their own. While slightly generic, they each have some cool units that do standout, including my personal favourite ZUES for the PHC which shoots out a lightning arc, covering a wide area in front of it.\n\nEach factions has the following number of Units/Structures. PHC = 4 Frigates, 4 Cruisers, 3 Aircraft and 3 Dreadnaughts. 4 main unit structures that don't require any sort of Tier upgrades. Substrate consist of the same amount of units, but they play differently to PHC, with their own set of structures and requirements.\n\nThe game also has several defenses for both factions. Smarties, which are rocket batteries and target light air units and ground units. Sensor Arrays, Anti-Air, Drone Bays, Repair Bay and Turrets, which are effective towards Dreadnaughts.\n\nA total of 6 Orbitals, each of them completely different. You have Incursion Orbitals, consistent drop of turrets, Amplifiers, EMP, Jammers/Nullifiers (Which disable the use of Orbtials) and the Orbital Strike.\n\nSupport Abilities being a total of 4, and 5 Offensive Abilities. The game also has upgrades that increase unit damage, unit health and also resource management, such as increasing total unit count, Metal and Radioactives.\n\nEach faction employs different strategies, and while there is currently only two, both are fun to play, and the third should be no different.\n\nNow onto the PROS and CONS for Ashes of the Singularity (In My Own Personal Opinion)\n\nPROS:\n\n+ Two Factions that plays different from each other.\n+ Some of the best A.I I've come to experience from an RTS game (It simply doesn't "Cheat" and that's wonderful)\n+ Good unit designs, especially for the Dreadnaughts.\n+ Great number of maps, ranging from Tiny, Small, Medium and Large, and majority of them are very well designed.\n+ The OST, while limited, is composed very well. The music gives the game this surreal and serene feeling, and somewhat haunting to a degree.\n+ Impressive technology from the Nitrous Engine.\n+ Surprisingly plays quite well on my 2500k, 270x w/ 8GB RAM. (Pretty damn well optimized) Mix of High/Medium settings.\n+ Decent sound effects.\n\nCONS:\n\n- Lack of any Voice Over in-game for text.\n- Limited amount of sound cues for units. Could use more variety in the sound overall.\n- Lack of any substantial campaign, and while this isn't much of an issue for me, personally, It's fair to point out that the game currently lacks such a feature, much like Sins of A Solar Empire. This will be improved in time.\n- Lacks an assortment of Game Modes, and while the game does feature SCENARIOS, such as King of the Hill, the game mainly plays out like a CAPTURE & HOLD / Annihilation.\n- Needs more units, and a much larger END-GAME that consists of progression towards an Ultimate Unit, such as a TITAN or EXPERIMENTALS.\n\n(The Developers are doing an excellent job at taking feedback, suggestions and responding to the community. The game has an extensive ROADMAP and I highly recommend anyone check it out before purchasing. Ashes of the Singularity, It's a pretty damn good RTS)","April 5","true","16.0"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","11","15","0","0"

If, like me, your reaction speeds hurt your modern RTS playing, welcome to the game for you. I'm a huge fan of turn-based strategy specifically because of the lack of focus on instantaneous micromanagement. Ashes has a similar feel, where the responsiveness of the bulkiest units requires you to plan ahead. The focus on flooding the map with units also moves the focus away from micromanagement to a more-traditional grand strategy approach of attacks, counterattacks, and contingency plans. I'd say this is an RTS for the TBS crowd, and I personally love it.","April 5","true","16.3"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","0"

Huge armies duking it out with lots of particle effects, and the occasional orbital ability. Managing what you bring to a fight and the route that it's going to take matters more than exact positioning or trying to get of an ability in a given split second.\n\nLikes: the economy and army system emphasises map control. Unit rosters are reasonably diverse, and the races themselves handle differently. Orbital abilites are strong, and can really impact the flow of the game, but often aren't an automatic win on their own.\n\nProblems: there's still some balance issues, as the different unit rosters means that sometimes it's really not easy to respond to something if you're PHC or Substrate. Defense are generally pretty poor, and combined with the strong focus on map control it's basically impossible to turtle without lossing really fast. Even trying to use defenses to stall often doesn't work. The deve's are working on all of this, including putting some new units into the game (for free), but at the moment it's still present.\n\nAlso, a bunch of features that are promised haven't been implemented yet. Spectator mode, for instance.","May 24","true","47.0"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Thier are multiple ways to wage war, not battles mind you, accros the giant maps they provide. When i first bought this game I refunded it due to the lack of having any sort of tutorial. I have rebought this game, before they even fully released a main tutorial, and found multiple guides made by the dev's online on how to play. This game is very fun and addictive; Now down to the pro's and con's.\n\nPro's:\nLots of massive battles, all going on at once, just like a war should be.\nAn amazing way to micro these fights, by putting them in a group and letting the sub integent AI take over (Cylons?!)\nMany diffrent ways to play at diffrent paces, and very strongly varient AI to help you find your starting difficulty.\nDev's are always patching glitches they find.\nABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL. The look of the game is amazing, i havnt played a prettier RTS game.\nA good multiplayer community.\n\n\nCon's:\nsome minor and major glitches (most of these dont make the game unplayable, but their is one Texture glitch that can happen that will stop rendering the correct colors) Yet we cant hold this against them as this is a game in beta. NOT ONLY THAT but the glitches they find are normaly quickly patched.\nSomewhat hard to find a multiplayer game sometimes due to the lack of people, but this is less of a con and more of another beta effect\n\n\nSo overall as it is in its current development, i'll give Ashes Of The Singularity an 8/10, on full release of content this review will be rewriten and most likely given an even higher score.","March 13","true","5.7"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/themudpig/recommended/228880/","themudpig","centaurianmudpig","http://steamcommunity.com/id/themudpig/","312 products in account","I really love this game.  Finally a game which does not rely on the number of clicks per second you can perform.  Build your units, assign it to an army at the click of a button and tell your army where to go.  Your army will form up, stick together and adjust the formation to position units where they should be for maximum effect.  A good example of this is the basics frigates, one of which is meant to be used as cannon fodder; they will move between your army and any aggressor to protect the more valuable units.\n\nThere are 3 tiers of ground units; Frigates, Cruisers (?) and Dreadnoughts.  Each tier has a range of units to provide different tactical options. Frigates include the cannon fodder I mentioned earlier, a rocket launcher, medic and scout.  Cruisers include artillery, anti-air, anti-dreadnought and brawler.  Dreadnoughts come in 3 flavors; anti-dreadnought, anti-buildings and another brawler.\n\nDreadnoughts can be upgraded with abilities which are shared across it's designated army.  From shields to extra firepower there are many to choose from, or you could sacrifice a level upgrade to repair your entire fleet.\n\nAir unit selection is rather lacking with a scout, anti-air and anti-ground units.  The bombers (anti-ground) are very effective when used in large numbers and can be extremely difficult to defend against large numbers as they can quickly destroy anti-air defences.  Some more powerful anti-air defences would be nice to make anti-air defences more potent, though at the time of review bombers are quite expensive to build (in their defence).\n\nI've worked my way through the majority of the campaign (just one left, unless the Dev's add any more).  There has been some criticism against the single player.  Yes, there are no voiceovers and the mission objectives are relayed over to your via text.  Sometimes you could accidently skip over these communication text messages, as they pop up in the corner of the screen and dismissed by clicking any button, which when you are clicking to give orders for armies or build queues you could potentially dismiss them before you noticed them.\n\nThe missions themselves are fun and slowly introduce new tech as you progress, just as you expect from an RTS.  Some side missions open up the tech tree more than on the main story, which is a little baffling.  You are given a range of new toys that won’t be explained until you head further through the main branch of the campaign.\n\nWhen it comes to the introductions, some of the explanations of the tech are also easily misunderstood.  For example you can add an amplifier on a resource node (for collecting metal or radiation, your primary construction resources).  Then activate an ability on the amplifier to increase the income rate of the resource.  I totally miss understood and just built the amplifier, unaware of the orbital ability until I noticed it in another mission.  It's not a major gripe; it just meant I learnt how to use that technology a little later than the game perhaps expected me to have.\n\nOverall, as I started this review I really love this game.  I have been mostly playing skirmish against the AI to improve my skills and knowledge and have enjoyed being blown up by Human opponents whom are more knowledgeable than myself.  I will be looking forward to applying my new commander skills against the Humans, having now being able to handle myself against a normal AI opponent.","May 4","true","60.7"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

The game looks utterly fantastic too with little things from Supreme Commander and Sins of a Solar Empire seeping in but the game taking on its very own identity too!\n\nIts vast, huge infact and you'll be fighting on multiple fronts at any giving time, you'll not have much rest from start to finish. The awesome hierarchy of the game is brilliantly implemented. Your battleships act as a control sector where you can have reinforcements go to or your cruisers before having the littler craft beef up your army.\n\nThere is excellent upgrades and a whole host to already get stuck into and I've had a blast and continue to have a blast playing it!\n\n\nCheck out my first impressions here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O22teGaNyXY","October 26, 2015","true","5.4"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","11","16","0","0"

It is like Supreme Commander but with a whole lot of the things SupCom:FA does wrong fixed. No more pointless tiers of both units and extractors that exist solely to pad out the game and make it longer than it has to be. The stuff you're building from the start are units you will be using throughout, so nothing goes obsolete other than what your opponent counters. It's a very strategic game.\nIt's not perfect though. Factions are so all-around that most matches feel like you're both just doing the exact same thing and there's nothing with some real game-changing power to it. Nothing with the impact of well placed Siege Tanks from Brood War. The slower pace both makes even slower players able to react, but on the other hand it makes everyone able to react. The upside is easier to play for people who aren't as fast, the downside is this means it's very much a numbers game. Very few surprises makes the games fairly predictable.\nIf you like big RTS games or just RTS games in general, definitely buy this one. It's the best one of its sort coming out for a long time. If you think RTS are just who-can-click-fastest competitions, well first of all you're bad at video games and second of all this game might be your type of thing. Though if you exclusively play EU or HoI then you'll get as stomped in this game as in any other RTS, because it's not slow to the point where you can go afk for a few minutes and come back without having lost.","April 1","true","25.5"," 15 of 24 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","15","24","0","0"

I can say that i thoroughly enjoy Ashes of the Singularity. There are a few let downs with the major one for me being the lack of Races and units to build. Radioactives are scarce and once backed in to a corner you can't come back because of the lack of radioactives.\n\nPro's\n-Gameplay takes more than 40 minutes on normal AI or harder and there is no "rush" capabilities against the AI however this leads to stale end game.\n-The fact that the Dreadnaughts can gain experience and level up to turn the tide of a fight is a nice touch.\n-Quanta is also an interesting feature because it allows you to build more units and even increase their firepower to health depending on whether you want to turtle or front line. or focus on just surviving\n\n\nSo far i can see 4 different game-play styles: turtle, split, AOE and front-line which is really neat to see in a game like this where the AI are actually a challenge and react to what you build the harder difficulty you verse","April 5","true","22.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jakbal/recommended/228880/","jakbal","Balaz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jakbal/","163 products in account","Sins of a Solar Empire met with the the good old Total Annihilation formula (though tactics-wide it's mostly Sins, just with power nodes instead of planets and drones instead of fighters, basically everything is the same except there are no titans and stations... yet) and a great game engine which finally doesn't slow down, crashes, whatsoever when pushed to the limits. Plus you have an insanely good micromanaging AI so no more wasted time on unnecessary clicking just to stop artys making rush moves inside a formation. Even if you send your units through a bottleneck, they make a circle just to take the optimal form and composition to fit through it not unlike in most other RTS where they just make a cluster♥♥♥♥ of random units bumping on each other. The DX12 support can be described best just like: +15 FPS on max graphics. The weak spot of the game is the mediocre Campaign (more like an extended tutorial), but Sins didn't even have one and well... who cared. The other is the kind of bare maps mostly due to the lack of water warfare. Most of the difference comes from the node linkings (Sins again... without space that is). And we're still waiting for the 3rd faction... on the other hand: I can't wait to see what the modders can do with this engine because Sins had great ones but every one of them hit the cap of the engine fast with memory and threading issues. Not to mention Supreme Commander where you get a 1/10 simulation slowdown even with the vanilla game.\n\nCons:\nThe explosions are kind of boring though, because there are no wrecks but devs've made some posts how the engine could handle it so I'm looking forward to see falling plane wreckages all around like in SupCom.\nStill lacking some controls, like different army type selection.\nMusic is so-so... Sins has great diverse tracks but it's like SupCom: a few "let's just say, ok" tracks here and there but they get old fast.\n\nWe'll see how they're going to patch up this game like the've done with most of their previous titles.","April 2","true","19.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Throughout the development they were in constant communication with the community asking for feedback, getting feedback and implementing the feedback into the game. Absolutely top notch support from these guys and they provided tons of info, roadmaps and update info.

Sorry about not reviewing the multiplayer part - the gameplay is essentially the same as playing solo just that you're playing against opponents that have even more initiative than the AI do, which is bad news for me :D. - I'll build slow and die fast, since I'm quite helpless without my SupCom base shields :D.

This is the highlight of the game for me so far.\n\nAs for what the actual gameplay is like, it's very  reminiscent of Supreme Commander while having enough innovation that it doesn't feel derivative.   The region system both adds focal points for conflict, while encouraging strategy on a macro level.  The army system makes controlling hundreds of units both intuitive and easy, while at the same time emphasising unit composition and ability.  The upgrades and special abilities demand some thought as the both pull from the same resource pool, and in some cases will permanently increase in cost through the course of the game.\n\nThe graphics are top shelf and large battles are fun and exciting to watch play out.\n\nA word of warning though, if you prefer fast pace, or micro intensive RTS's, then this game is not for you.  This game is about slowly building momentum until you roll over your opponent.","January 29","true","132.5"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","8","11","2","0"

Not as hectic as Planetary Annihilation. I like it's pace so far.\nAlso it's less complicated with a decent amount of units. (I don't need 100 different units with 70% just being upgraded tier ones)\nJust enough to let you have the clue about them quickly and focus more on the strategy and where to send them.\nI'm not immediately lost in a choice of hundreds of units which makes it really accessible for new players. Upgrading is linear and has a small depth which is also good.\nThe units organize themselves well enough to have less micro management.\nI just like how to claim the map and how it's devided in zones to give you a quick overview of your control within a second of looking at the map.\nIn general it just feels good to me. Definetly one of those games I'd rather start when I'm bored that doesn't turn me off by thinking of playing it like Evolve which I like but where I just feel to bad to even start it online fearing to become the monster and get my ♥♥♥ kicked right away.\nAI feels also fair ... though I only played on easy so far and won with a massive army. It tested and found my weakpoints after some time.\nFrom the design of the connection of those points I'd assume that I could cut off parts of the enemies eco when capturing points in the middle of his territory. (It does!)\nGraphics are good enough. I like the particle effects of the projectiles. The explosions of dreadnaughts not as much.\nLightning could be more dramatic. It looks kinda flat which is nice for strategy but not if you're seeking for nice graphics.\nFreesync works well with it.\n\nThe soundtrack is good. Wide, open, slow but dramatic orchestral. I like the battle soundtracks and the transition between soundtracks is also smooth. No Hi-Res though. (ogg 350kb/s 44khz)\nSoundeffects are also good. Lasers remember me of star wars. The explosions should be more dramatic/satisfying.\nThe voice acting is not that good.\n\nLoadtimes are incredibly fast. I installed it on my SSD and a 1v1 AI skirmish loads within 3sec.","April 3","true","25.6"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

It may be lacking in a few areas, but that just means the makers have room to improve.\n\nWith the little time I have spent in the game (~5 hours), I have noticed a few things.  The game itself has a lot of potential to fill that gap we all need ... the slightly slower paced but more satisfying RTS experience on a larger scale.  However, I think there is still room for improvement in some areas as well as a few suggestions I have.\n\nPros:\n+Large maps.\n+Big fights.\n+Fun end-game units.\n+Great music.  Need more of this!\n\nCons:\n-Little story.\n-Little to no voice acting, especially from the units.  And the sound quality for them seems to be very low and no variety in their response to commands... just the same bleep bloop sound they make.\n-Although I understand the game is still in its infancy, there are not very many units, buildings, or factions to choose from in the game.\n-No variation in formations once a group has been made into an army. (Take examples from the Supreme Commander or Homeworld series)\n\nSuggestions:\n*I am not sure if modding of the game is allowed, but if the makers let the community expand the game themselves with their ideas by creating new maps and new units, the makers could benefit from this.\n*More unit variety and specializations.\n*Expand on the veterancy of all units rather than just Dreadnaughts (examples from Supreme Commander series and Red Alert 2) reinforcing the idea of keeping your units alive through multiple battles instead of throwing them at a wall.\n*More voice acting!  Especially from the units themselves.\n*More formations to choose from within armies.\n*Ability to split an army group in half (or as best as you can) to make multiple groups comprised of the same types and numbers of units in a hurry.\n*A technology wing or research building to specialize in to adapt to your enemies strengths and weaknesses.\n*More early-to-midgame units.\n*Even larger maps!\n\nI enjoy the game as of right now, but would love to see improvement.\n","May 8","true","8.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Zerg-rushing really doesn't work very well, since the primary base for each faction can actually defend itself. All in all this portion of the gameplay is excellent.\n\nThe tech tree is split into a few parts. Different units and buildings follow the normal progression (Building X is required for Unit X, Y for Y, etc.), but unit, logistical, and economic upgrades all fall under the same resource (called Quanta). When you have enough Quanta for the upgrade, just click on it and it instantly applies. I can't strictly say I'm a tremendous fan of that particular mechanic, BUT they added a twist to it that I genuinely do enjoy. In addition to using Quanta for upgrades, you can use it for one-off effects like calling down an orbital strike, small units, sensor sweeps, etc. I personally think this is an excellent tradeoff. It gives you the ability to think on the fly a bit, and adds a lot more tactical flexibility that the game would otherwise lack. I'd call this part of things good, but I still don't particularly like that instant gratification research system. Maybe tying the upgrades to when a dreadnought levels (allowing them to apply the upgrade to the army they're leading) so it isn't automatic would be better.\n\nUnit diversity is a bit... lacking visually. I understand the reasoning, but honestly it's difficult to tell what a unit's function is at a glance. Once you know what each unit does it's fine, but truth be told I'm not a fan of the designs overall. That said, when large armies clash it is visually spectacular. Laser, plasma, missiles, bombs, and slugs go flying around and just look cool. I'm guessing this is why the designs look so basic/indistinct. If each unit was highly detailed it'd probably be a graphics card melter. I do still think it could have been done a lot better.\n\nThe maps are likewise incredibly bland. They look alright as long as you don't zoom in on them, but holy mother of god they're oogly up close. This, in my opinion, is the weakest part of the game by a wide margin.\n\nThe super-units, dreadnoughts, are distinct, visually interesting, and generally a lot of fun. They've each got their own niches, but all of them are absolute beasts without being unkillable. Proper army composition is more important than raw numbers to a large degree, and moving these things at the center of a force that you're sending in to annihilate your enemy is tons of fun to watch.\n\nThe economy of the game is more complex than it first appears. Each unit requires 2 or 3 resources to construct: Logistics, Metal, and Radioactive Materials. You can store only limited amounts of each, but the overall capacity can be increased with Quanta. You collect these resources by constructing collectors on nodes which will require a consistent supply line back to your home base. Once it's built, you get the resource at a fixed (but slightly upgradeable) rate. This means that prioritizing construction of units, buildings, and resource development is a must. This is also where the bulk of the game's micromanagement comes in. Defending your supply chains is VITAL, and losing a single node in a key place can cripple your economy. Setting up an attack at one of these chokepoints is awesome if you can pull it off.\n\nThe only bug I've seen is that it tends to crash when you click "Done" after a skirmish.\n\nOverall, my opinion is pretty positive. The game's got a few mild annoyances, but at the same time is a really well done strategy game. It's hurt by the lack of a co-op campaign, visual style complaints (which I'll admit are subjective and possibly justified), and a "meh" soundtrack. It's well worth purchasing IF you're rocking the necessary hardware.\n\nSpecs of my PC:\n\nIntel core i7 5820 (OC'd to 4 ghz)\n16 gigs DDR4 2666\nGTX 980 card\nrunning from a samsung 850pro SSD\nWindows 7","May 8","true","14.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Ashes of the Singularity might be right up your alley.\nhttps://youtu.be/S6v_wHdSBCU\n\nAt it's core, the game is a solid RTS, and pretty well fleshed out. It has the campaign, skirmish modes, and multiplayer (complete with ranked matches). All the boxes checked for what you want in terms of game modes.  But how is the game itself?\n\nWell, I'd say overall it compares at a pretty even level with other good titles out there, such as the previously mentioned Supreme Commander.\nThat's not calling it average or mediocre though. The game is well polished, and plays well. It's a good sign of a game when you actually struggle to find things that annoy you or were tedious. Ashes is overall a pretty smooth experience, and for experienced RTS players, it's not hard to jump right into it.\n\nThe universal upgrade system is a bit of an interesting direction, as you don't need to build up buildings to research upgrades. In fact, there's no real tech tree to speak of at all, just upgrades.\n\nSpeaking of buildings, don't be expecting to build up massive bases like in some other RTS games out there. No sir. Buildings in general -while important- seem to take a back seat to combat.\n\nMake no mistake about it, the large scale battles are what Ashes is banking on, and it is something it pulls off beautifully. Quite amazing to watch, really; with missiles, drones, lasers, and you name-it flying all over the battlefield, massive amounts of units moving in formations... the intensity really ramps up when combat starts.\nYou'll actually find yourself wanting to build up a massive amount of units just to throw them all into another fight.\n\nSome of the small touches are nice too, for example the big dreadnaughts gain experience from combat and can unlock some near game-changing abilities.\nAlso the unit variety, while not earth-shattering, is plenty to have something for most any situation.\n\n\nSound is decent, there are times where the little computer lady talking to me would blurt out stuff I could barely understand, but otherwise the little alert noises, music, and -of course- explosions seemed adequate.\n\nVisually the game is good. I'm talking about the graphics themselves, not watching everything unravel on a battlefield-wide scale. The units are interesting looking, detailed, and can be quite colorful depending on your player color. More so than a lot of other RTS games. Scenery around looks pretty nice, though there are some times when I had to look again to make sure things hadn't frozen. If you don't have units moving around, it's an easy mistake to make, as the buildings themselves are basically static.\n\nI won't say everything is sunshine and roses though. There's a few things that I find a bit bland or unpleasant.\n\nFor starters, I'm not a fan of the lines connecting every resource point. It's strange, and it takes away any sense of "maybe I can hide a small factory up on this hillside to prep an ambush and they'll not notice me." Nope, sorry, there's a frikkin LINE drawn straight to every resource node.  No secrets there.\n\nSince you're just some commander in charge of a bunch of units, there's not much personality or character to things. Nothing to really draw you in. You're not going to be screaming "Johnny NOOOOOOOooooo!" When your favorite dreadnaught gets blown up, you're just going to build another one. (If you haven't already.)\n\nIt would also be nice to see some more skirmish or multiplayer maps that weren't just symmetrical.\n\nMost of my complaints are fairly minor things though, and do little to detract from the game overall.\n\nI've enjoyed the game a lot thus far, and expect I will continue to enjoy it a lot longer. I'd recommend picking it up if you're a fan of the Total Annihilation or Supreme Commander style RTS games.\n\nTLDR?\nIt's fun, it's pretty, and it's got a bit of the "wow" factor. It's good.","May 5","true","5.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Its got that same kinda feel to it, but with more dynamices, bigger maps (excluding FAF) and a variety of units.  Dreadnaught ships which are kinda like SupCom experimentals are fantastic, bceause there is no 1 unit to spam. I once had 1 killer Dreadnaught take down 5 or 6 of the enemy ones in the same life simply because he was sending the wrong ones against me.\n\nMy only complaint is that there is only 2 factions, I'd like to see 1 more at least, but thats only a minor niggle for me, even though ive only played this for a little while, i really am loving it","March 18","true","13.0"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

You're supposed to be able to order reinforcements, yet it's horribly buggy.  I am sure they are aware and have either fixed or plan to fix it.\n\nThere are certainly some balance issues with this game.  The 2 foremost are artillery and healing.  There should be a defensive structure that gives a bubble shield specifically for dealing with artillery or some such counter to artillery.  As of right now the artillery dreadnaught of the PHC can level a base using it's long range cannons and by investing in the radar upgrade.  Healing is a major concern.  Substrate cannot heal.  This makes their dreadnaughts pointless.  Great, you've gotten to level 5.  It has 10 health left.  Now what?\n\nRegardless of this, it's a solid RTS that is rather fun.  You can get locked into long beautiful battles repeatedly in a game and I find this is what a wargame should be all about.

It's true that this game is currently going through a beta phase, and the full game is not expected for a while, but as it stands it's not really doing anything to captivate my interest. A Beta is not an Alpha, meaning that major gameplay changes are unlikely to be made before actual release. Ill tell you what I liked and dislike as I go along. But the major down sides were the line system, the boring nature of the units, and the overly neat command of mass paired units. I didn't like the character of the buildings or the actual maps themselves, and to me the game was overly refined.\n\n============================\n\nFirstly, I thought the HUD system in Ashes was amazing, probably one of the best I've ever seen, and that is, until I actually played Homeworld Deserts of Kharak. Battlefield wise, I didn't like that the far zooming option wasn't there. I really like my tactical long distance view, but in this game you can't go up sky high and watch things unfold. Sadly zooming deeply into a units wasn't available either making your connection to individual ships and the overall experience of big battles less personal and immersive. The unit AI is a little bit too intuitive, and so is the build structure order, the whole process comes off as a bit predefined and lacking substance. Everything flows too well together, the units fold in perfectly, the trajectories of particles falls where it should and you’d think that’s perfect right? Sadly it was lacking that chaotic feel of micro managing everything, and having things miss sometimes. I seldomly ever had to micro anything and I also felt like that took away from the experience. I didn't like the line build system, man I REALLY didn’t like the line build system, it felt very outdated and unnecessary. The units also didn't captivate me, they seemed repetitive in design and nature. The effects were pretty, but not as pretty as Deserts of Kharak. The map design was lacking allot of character, as the maps seemed very generic and lacking realism. I wasn’t excited to scroll through the map list, and I never really cared about the backstory of any of the multiplayer maps, it just didn’t feel “cool” to be there. The Air units felt a little bit silly, especially as they were aimlessly circling my base, at one point I was hoping they would hover? The pirates protecting metal nodes were fun, but they had no real reason to be there, and they weren't diverse in nature. In Sins of the Solar Empire the pirates are inhabitants of the planets, the second you go into their system they attack you for crossing into their territory, in this? Well, they are there just because. I get that they want to control base expansion speeds, but why not have some back story and life behind those pirates. It felt like too much of a copy paste job, just because. The detection system, fog of war and unit vision was excellent. Unit response was impeccable. The structures looked dull, and lacking that “cool” or “I actually care about this building” feeling. In conclusion it's a waiting game with Ashes, but at the moment I’d rather play Homeworld Deserts of Kharak -- by far. These two titles are galaxies apart and I mean that literally. Ashes feels like a rip of many games, it doesn’t feel like there is enough unique character in this game. Being a DX 12 RTS game is cool, but that’s about the only thing that’s really going for this title.\n\nIf you want your fills, just get a cheap version of Supreme Commander 2, It's honestly all you need.","February 26","false","1.4"," 23 of 41 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","23","41","0","2"

The art style is great, and even though there are some texture glitches on the outside of the "undiscovered" map, it's not really noticable once you become absorbed into the gameplay.\n\nThe tutorial is great, and I definitely got the needed basic to be able to play, with further learning to be done in Skirmishes, Campaign and Online.

This game has some really large scale battles I will give it that, but it isn't without its flaws\n\nThe game lacks some basic functionality that could really push it over the edge into being a great game. For example, you can create 'armies'. This is the same as in many other games where you create control groups and can simply press the button assigned to that army to instantly select all units within it. The problem is, it feels as if the game considers enemy armies one unit. So when you tell your units to attack an enemy, they will attack whatever enemy is closest. This means you cannot focus fire enemy units. If there is a repair drone repairing your enemy's units? Well, you're just going to have to hope that your units hurry up and chew through the front lines of your opponent's forces because that's the only way they will target the drones, is when they get to them.\n\nThe game's ranked matchmaking also seems to not have a clue what it's doing. At rank 8 (I believe there are only 10 ranks) I was matched against a rank 4 player. Without knowing too terribly much of what I was doing, I was completely destroyed and didn't stand a chance. Next game was a similar match up and then I simply gave up.\n\nThe units are also lacking in diversity. You essentially have your tech 1 units, tech 2 units, and tech 3 units, for those Supreme Commander fans out there. What this means is, you will start by building frigates. These are the cheapest most basic units. You will quickly need to up your production however, and start building cruisers, which are the slightly more expensive but much more powerful units. Finally, for late game play you will want to build dreadnoughts. These are the giant ships that can take on armies on their own, but still need support. The problem is there isn't much difference between units. Sure, some are quite unique. But let's take the default faction for example. They have a rocket frigate, rocket cruiser, and rocket dreadnought. The difference between the three? How many rockets they fire and how much damage they do. There are also air units, but all you really have are your fighters, bombers, and scouts.\n\nAll of this said, this game has great potential if it can have some balance updates, maybe some units added, and of course the matchmaking fixed. I highly recommend it for those looking for an RTS that is simple to get into but takes a lot of patience and practice to master.","April 6","true","41.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The only issues ive ever had with the game was the creating an army with ALOT of units(which, honestly, is kinda understandable) and the verry slight lag, though that may just be because i need a new graphics card. it does crash every once in a blue moon(what game doesnt?) but other than that, i really like this game, and would recommend it to my friends who enjoy RTS games. overall, 8/10 from me.

You can build huge armies and conquer the mostly also huge maps.\nIt has some interesting new features compared to the usual genre representatives. For one theres the option to have your armies micro themselves. Which is pretty neat. The mechanic that provides and distributes ressources is pretty interesting as well, because the only way to get the ressources is through capturing points which will then produce ressources for you.\nYou can speed up the process by constructing extractors and other gathering enhancements. The need to control these points on the map add a new tactical element to the game. And the game requires some strategic thinking. Your `ground` forces move very slowly. Which means you should always know where they should be in the near future, so you have to think two or three steps ahead.\nLastly this game is mostly a multiplayer title. The campaign is really short, 11 missions, and can easily be played through.\nSkirmishes against the AI are fun and on hard difficulties challenging, but will probably get boring after some time.\nThe graphics are okay to good. Huge battles do look pretty nice. But the map quality is rather disappointing. They mostly look the same and the same dosesn`t even look any good. No variety.\nIn the end theres to say : If you´re interested in RTS with tactical elements and a good AI you can risk a look.\nI`d wait for a sale though. Because I cannont whole-heartedly recommend this game in its current state at the full price. 50% would be a pretty good deal.\n\n","May 13","true","3.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

If you like RTS games I encourage you to try this game out for yourself because it in itself  is a good game but its nothing groundbreaking. Once you complete the campaign, which had its difficulty reduced for good reason, you will either have to play skirmish or online. The problem with skirmish is that the AI is unbalanced. Before you know it you will be attacked by the substrate factions favorite unit the punisher. This bomber is super over powered and will completely overwhelm your defenses before you're ready and even if you think you're ready. If there is enough (which there usually are) they can destroy your HQ in one pass equaling game over. this is my biggest pet peeve with the game and I'm sure/hope it will be fixed in the future. There is also a problem for me where the game will completely freeze once a match is over forcing me to completely sign off my computer for it to work again. Like I said earlier there really isn't anything groundbreaking from the game, but it is a pretty solid RTS that I find myself coming back to again and again so that is why I recommend it.","May 22","true","46.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It just needs more people playing it because it takes a while at times to find a custom game.

It's a fair comparison - this game's mechanics are very well done, and allows MASSIVE wars between players.  The learning curve is easier than most other realtime strategies, but the single player campaign feels rushed like there wasn't enough time to finish it.\n\nThe resource system is intuitive, interesting, easy to use, and provides lots of strategic options while not requiring micromanagement.  In fact, "not requiring micromanagement" seems to be the slogan of AotS, and units can be grouped into armies that are given commands as a group by clicking on any member of the army - very nice.\n\nThere are three resources: metal, radioactives and quanta.   Metal and radioactives work roughly like minerals and vespene gas from Starcraft, but without (you guessed it) micromanagement.  Quanta is generated from buildings and used for orbital abilities (magic) plus upgrades.\n\nThe music is downright fantastic.\n\nWhen zoomed in, the game doesn't look as good as Supreme Commander.  When zoomed out (ie: in actual gameplay) it looks better in many ways because you see the units, not the icons.\n\nOverall rating: Supreme Commander is one of the best RTS games ever made, and I like playing AotS more.  The strategy, control system, resource management and music is just that good.  Highly recommended.","May 14","true","31.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","1"

It draws from those games yes, but they are doing their own thing and i like it alot.\n\nI like the cap system where you establish supply routes and try to disrupt the enemy lines! Cut one of the lines and no matter how many mines they have on the other side they will get no money from them.\n\nI like the eco where you have constant flow of resources in and out. You need to balance income vs spending since storage of resources is limited. This means if you mine more then you spend, those resources are lost! So if you gain resources you need to build more factories to spend it all.\n\nThe game is slow paced with more focus on planning and strategy. I love this. Dont get me wrong i like games like starcraft but i dont view sc as a strategy game. I view it as real time tactics game since it focuses on small battles where micro and clickspeed is key.\nSlow paced does not mean no harass or skirmishing. Its really effective to send bombers behind enemy lines to bomb their resource points (really good if theyve not done a good job of providing aa. Really effective right after they capped the area since aa takes a little while to build)\n\n\nSound is bad.

I grew up playing RTS games from Red Alert 1  on, I really enjoyed CNC3, which is the last RTS I enjoyed other than my yearly game of Sins I play with a friend.\n\nI've only played a few games but I really enjoyed it, and it's nice that your "logistics/medics" will do their job automatically instead of not knowing if they will, you can see they are actively doing their job in your "army". The turinium outpost capture definitely adds an aspect to it, you can't just turtle or you will lose eventually. So there is an added strategic element beyond domination. Which I'm indifferent towards, at first I didn't like it. But the more I've played it's kind of cool, you can definitely come to a stand still trying to get the turinium outposts!\n\nI still need to try PvP, and a super big game with thousands of units. I bought the game because I loved SINS and support these guys without looking at the specs, I was very surprised my GTX 970 couldn't run max graphics at 60 FPS, before I did my research. Guess it's time to get a 1070 :)","May 9","true","28.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I'm sure there is a cap but I've yet to see any sign of one.  I have yet to notice any loss of performance from having too many units on screen at once.\n\nThe campaign feels more like an extended tutorial than the sort of narative campaign you see in games like Starcraft, but unlike the actual tutorial the missions are still interesting and can be quite challenging at times.  Having spent most of my RTS time lately on Starcraft I actually found the "extended tutorial" format to be a good thing, as it allowed me to gradually adjust my playstyle to the new game without forcing me to just lose over and over in skirmishes until I figured it out.  Future updates will likely contain additional campaigns, so hopefully we'll get more narative later on.","May 14","true","38.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Hopefully another faction or two will be added in the future. Well worth the price I paid and can't get enough of the Substrate action :).

On the whole, it is a good game. It does have its flaws, most notably unit speed, even the light units, is pretty slow which means expect a fair amount of time to be spent waiting for armies to get in position. The only other major flaw I see is a lack of tactical options other than overwhelming brute force to win.\n\nThe linked resource system is an interesting developement which eliminates turtling as you must expand as well as cut your opponents supply links to starve them. So expect a lot of skirmishes around link nodes! This includes forward bases, if a forward base's link is severed, it goes offline.\n\nOverall, an interesting DX12 showcase game that I hope continues to be updated and polished, I average ~30fps in 1080p, a bit lower in clashes, with an i6 6500k, GTX 970 and 16g ram at maximum settings.","April 11","true","9.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The only mode seems to be a point based victory. Capturing Generators VS Destroying the enemy off the map. Havent seen much on Researching technologies yet. Straight forward RTS otherwise. Units get built as squads which assist in the "scale " part of units on grid. The maps so far seem to be mountainous and hilly not real massive plains to show off large scale fighting. But it is an Alpha and hopefully this game gets fleshed out a lot more. If not, it's replayability will be a quick phase with limited combat scenarios and narrow unit play.\n\nThe warfare is decently on par with Supreme Commander, altho it doesnt feel as massive and no where nears the Planetary combat feel of Plantary Annahilation even on the Large maps. On that part is has the Standard RTS feel that the Command & Conquer series set over a decade ago. The angle of the pictures more gives to the massiveness then the actual feel of the game which feels limited as I said before.\n\nThe Graphics are amazing I will give it that. It's beautiful maps to small detail as Drones flying around your ships are amazing. This is one thing the game Excels at.\n\nOverall the Alpha is great to play. The Graphics are amazing. But the overall feel is Decade old Command & Conquer.... So far. I Completely hope their will be massive fleshing out of this game before its full release. Increase the "Massive" Feel so it competes with the likes of Planetary Annihilation and Supreme Commander.  The game lacks the Awefactor/This is Amazing feel it needs.","November 3, 2015","true","3.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

Having played RTS's for years, it's easy to see a game that is loaded with potential. The graphics and UI are incredible. The detail already in place on terran, units, buildings, etc. are great and will likely go much farther upon release. WIth the sheer scale one can play a game on (hundreds, even thousands of units), it could get confusing for people new to an RTS. For me, it makes the game very enjoyable. What bettter way to unwind after a long days work than to whipe out the enemy with a dozen Dreadnaughts, 25 artillery cruisers, 25 heavy cruisers, and swarms of frigates. Oh, and I almost forgot about the bombers that are so devistating, you better keep your units away from groud zero.\n\nThe game, obviously, has a lot more to be added; more indepth storyline, campaign mode, more factions, more units, more perks, etc. But so far, the developers are really on to something big. With the right creativity and time to impliment and test, I would be very surprised if this game doesnt win strategy of the year or more.\n\nOn a side note, I have yet to experience a crash, or any serious glitch for that matter; at least not that I could notice. My rig has an GTX 970 4GB, i7-5820K Haswell lga 2011 x99 chip and overlocked, 16GB of DDR4 RAM and 500GB SSD. Game runs like a dream but if I see a glitch or crash, I'll let the dev team know, as I hope everyone else is.\n\nCan't wait for the finished product!!!","November 6, 2015","true","34.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

I would say that if your planing to get this game, dont buy it unless you have a friend to play with because as of now it takes more then a full day to find someone to play with if your lucky. Ive never seen a game so tightly wounded on this feature while other games make it imperative that you play with other gamers in seconds of the installation.

Example.  Think of this game in the realm of supcom, but you do not need a huge sprawling base.  instead you build forward bases, and your heavy units can be upgraded the more experience they get.  The upgrades are done tastefully and there isnt a mega tree you need to micromanage.  Don't get me wrong, to be good at this game is not easy - it has a lot of depth, but its not overwhelming either.  Maps vary in size from very big - think supcom - to smaller.  MP games can take a while - not a really fast paced RTS.  If you are looking for the next CnC or Star Craft... this probably isnt it.  But if you are looking for something with some tactical depth then this is probably the game you've been looking for.\n\nThe devs support the game with real content.  It seems like they'll have a major update then a couple patch updates.  When they get the things ironed out they bring in more content. Normally I don't typically recommend early access but this game is truly deserving.\n\n","February 2","true","22.8"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

Just bought this today after umming and aaring over buying into early access but i must say even know this is a beta currently i am impressed with the game. I was a little hesitant at first buying this as i had been burnt by Planetary Annihilation and the fact im running an Amd 280x which isnt exactly cutting edge anymore but even on low with a mixture of medium setting im getting 40+ fps with dips to 30 in largish battles. Being a beta there are things that can be tweaked, like the UI I feel could use a little more information when you are selected on armies like how many units with what capabilities are in it and how many armies are selected in the control group you have set. Also a quicker way to find your dreadnaught in a massive control group. Now this all could be there already but if it is it needs to be made clearer i feel. Overall i feel there could be more information in general.\n\nI myself am not to concerned about the performance currently as im guessing Oxide will optimise it furthur in the coming month for release and the fact that i am running a I7 4790K with 16gb of ram and upgrading to a Pascal or Polaris series GPU in June/July. I know not everyone can have a cutting edge gpu but even on low to mid settings the game is still damn pretty.\n\nBuy this game if you are a fan of Total Annihilation and Supreme Commander FA.

The game supports multicore processing, pairing of gfx cards to share load(you don't need xfire/SLI and it is cross platform compatible, i.e AMD with Nvidia), building the game around dx12 with all of its glory and misery, with gorgeous and detailed graphics, not forgetting also smart AI that does the unit micro'ing for the player by assigning groups/squads as well as challenging AI bots as opponents. Notice that the game is all about showcasing technology.\n\nWhat the game lacks is actual gameplay. It is for the most part lacking and barren in terms of strategy & tactics, unit composition & pool, game depth, modding, factions count, unit tiers & tech trees, even the scale of the game is disappointing for a grand RTS. Yes, all these aspects are mediocrely done. Well its nice that the game has AI micro'ing but it is at best very amatuerish. Half the time i wish i could personally micro and macro. The economy balancing gameplay is also non existent, it copies Sup Com but its too simplified and dumbed down so much so that theres nothing to manage. Honestly, the AI technology behind the game is too good that i always end up having nothing to do in game, everything is on auto mode and managed by the AI. The entire AI, core game and structure that the devs developed end up constricting and boxing up the gameplay.\n\nSeriously, the gameplay is a disappointment overall, is this game supposed to be a movie, a interactive click and play adventure? Devs boast of trying to meld Sup Com with Starcraft and Dawn of War or Ground Control but what we get is pretty much an extremely weak RTS game that suffers from identity crisis and shallow RTS elements, theres no depth in the gameplay. What it has is merely beautiful eye candy and the awesome technology fueling it. So what? The essence of gaming is the gameplay itself. AotS is beautiful, but plain. There’s nothing here that hasn’t been done before and done better. And it doesnt have the spark or x-factor that made other RTS games like Sup Com, Warcraft/Starcraft, Dawn of War, Ground Control so engaging and lasting.\n\nThis game is perfect as a tech demo/showcase for computer engineers, tech geeks etc who want to learn and pioneer the future of gaming. If you're looking for a comprehensive and deep RTS, you can't find it here... at least not yet. Maybe when the expansions and dlcs come pouring in it'll turn more into a proper game rather than a tech showcase. I applaud the devs for trying to push gaming technology forward but AotS, is definitely not a full-fledged game.","April 2","false","37.0"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","1"

No game speed dilation either, with 6 races pulling 1000+ units on the map.\n\n"Yes I did use a few things to push the AI and myself to push the game a little further to see end game massive combat sooner."\n\nYou can with enough resources in game and in real life, have games with infinite units. Radar range can be upgraded to fill the entire map; units can be upgraded with insane amounts of hp and damage, although in a proper multiplayer game you’re not going to make it to these record high numbers, yet it’s still possible.\n\n2 Races as of current on release both showing different unit weaponry however their orbital strikes are still orbital strikes, would like to see a 3rd race where orbital strikes are not their super weapons. Long range artillery maybe?\n\nThis is in all an awesome RTS that gets you immersed into the combat, with huge battles and practically flawless performance. Unless you want to stream via Nvidia graphics cards then you will lose your mouse and will need to restart. Alt+Z is bad. On the original loading of the game it works. So set it up while main menu is loading.\n\nMy favourite feature?\nRadar: It’s not a perfect location of units; it just shows a heat map of energy. Brighter the colours more shiz is there and prepare for a battle.","October 23, 2015","true","18.2"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","11","20","2","0"

Being a fan of both Sins of a Solar Empire made by the same developer, and the cult classic Supreme Commander, this game breathes new life into the RTS genre. It is a little buggy, and my biggest complaint is not being able to zoom all the way out, even if that means only seeing icons instead of the beautifully modeled units themselves. The game seems a bit too demanding for what it is, but I understand that it's because it uses part of your GPU to manage the AI. Which, I suppose, is innovative. I would definitely reccomed this game to anyone who liked Supreme Commander, or any other RTS game of the like.","February 29","true","1.4"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

I figured out the controls and tech tree in the first game. Kind of like the planetside attack for the battles of taking place in space from Sins. But it's story doesn't connect to Sins.\n\nDisappointed that there is only 2 factions and wish there were more unit types. Scale is smaller than I expected, maybe because it's beta? 6v6 was the biggest map available and the map was too small to build large armies. No need to create several armies when one will do.\n\nThe game promises big battles. It has the power and capabilities. But the pacing is too fast and the maps are too small.","February 28","true","44.6"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

I have really enjoyed getting to know the two playable teams (with a third coming in the future) and found the A.I to be a great challenge. They will punish you for leaving small gaps in your defence (no anti-air, weak units left unattended). The best battles happen when there is a deadlock for control of the central point which provides a resource required to win. There can be some epic back and forth moments where the scores swing wildly as team counter attack, this is when Ashes really shines for me.\n\nAnother thing worth mentioning is the ability to reinforce an army on the fly. Now that I have the feature I can't believe RTS games didn't have this in the past! Pressing ctrl+Number assigns armies to that number. Once an army is selected you can build any units available and they will automatically head to reinforce the army directly. I LOVE THIS!\n\nGive it a try. Dev's are working hard on updates but it is a really enjoyable game as it stands!","May 9","true","16.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The size of it reminds me of Planetary Annihilation. Having armies of 300-500 units plus titans is amazing. Not just one army of that size either, The resourse system is simple enough. one doesn't need to pay too much attention, but always expanding is a good idea.\n\nI haven't had too many problems or bugs, but I have seen silly things like the titans or capital ships fly high into the air then land some place that the shouldn't be able to get to and thus can't move. Rendering them useless. Also a few minor bugs with commanding large armies of simple units. But it's a beta. So not really a problem when you know what your in for.\n\nAll in all, this is my new RTS and I feel could be a great RTS like the C&C/Red Alert games.

It's pretty decent for a beta. It reminds me allot of Surpreme Comander, with a bit of Sins of a solar empire thrown it.\n\nI'm looking forward to see what they do with it. I'd like to see more factions, and maybe some more units, maybe a huge titan class unit for more of an end game play. And of course you have the continuing bug fixes. other than a few crashes the only thing I've really seen is some weird path finding on the bigger units, mixed with some wandering. I could see them getting out of the way, if another big unit was trying to get through, but some times the just move for some random grunt. Oh also (unless I just missed it) more unit commands like "standgound" or other stances.\n\n\nI got it on sale, and i'm quite happy with it, but I don't know that I'd dump 49.99 on it as a beta. Just where I'm standing, I see this as being more of a 39.99 game once it's fully released.

It really does feel like Supcom meets COH with the way claiming regions of the map to gain resources works.\n\nI feel like there needs to be more variety of units/buildings before the full release some form of stealth or subterranean units would be really nice! I can't help but think looking towards Total Annihilation and even some the C&C Tiberean Wars series could represent some interesting ideas towards giving the units some more interesting mechanics.\n\nA further thought, I think the lack of variety is really that I feel more support based units/buildings would be a nice change as at the moment it very much feels like having more firepower/damage absorbtion results in a win.\n\nUltimately it is already a decent game, still doesn't feel as inspiring as WC3, Cossacks or Total Annihilation. I'm really looking forwards to see where this game is come release day and hope they don't add minor unpates with a couple of extra units and a bundle of maps like many games have done in the genre in the past.","March 6","true","8.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

I like good RTS games that aren't about rushing, but instead about strategy, and this seems to deliver.  I know I've only played 5 hours, but I'm already very impressed.\n\nWhat's good:\nGreat visuals, especially ship detail and such.\nLine of sight fog of war.\nResource gathering--feels like Rise of Nations, which I like.\nUnit control is simple.\nBIG armies.\n\nWhat could use work:\nToo few types of strategic resources.  There's basically 3, but only two on the map, the other is from a building you build.\nBuilding/tech tree is too shallow, so your research upgrades don't impact where you go.  It does end up being about who can field the largest army in the right spot.\nRequires the latest and greatest video cards.  My year old laptop is the only computer that can play it in my house. :(\n\nOverall, very happy with the game, and it'll drive me to buy new computers, just so I can play this with my kids.

Hope it will have a fun single player campain to go with the addicting and competitive ranked matches currently in the beta. Also hoping for more replay/spectator support in the full version.\n\nUpdate:\n\nTLDR: Multiplayer/skirmish is still good, but the single player campaign is not.\n\nThis game is still very fun after the full release, but the "ascendancy wars" single player campaing, while mechanically good, has a weak and forgettable story. I wish they would have left out the single player campain and put the money elsewhere, but then they would have been criticized for not having a single player gampaign. This is a double edged sword and I can definately see why they made the decision they did. The skirmish and multiplayer modes are very good and the actual gameplay mechanics are also very good. I wish the maps had a lot more character to them. They are very dull and boring. Maybe in the future they could add some texture packs and interactive scenery to the maps. All this bing said if you are looking for an awesome rts for its gameplay, multiplayer, and AI... then this is a very good game that will hopefully grow in the future. Things game needs are a robust replay and spectator mode, map visual enhancements, and hopefully continous support for balance and new units down the road.","March 5","true","60.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

I was optimistic and pleased with the Early access, I wrote about and had hoped for more...primarily I was seeking further balance, hoping for further units, buildings and factions.\n\nThe visuals are very good and the game has run really smoothly but I still cant help but feel let down. The promise of massive scale and sheer numbers of units has been met but only well sort of.\n\nIMO the design and balance of the game, making it a fight over resources and VP's, completely dictates the flow of play rather than letting it occour naturally. It feels forced. Most RTS games become a fight for resource or VP's/territory anyway why force it? I wrote before about how different play styles are unrewarded compared to an early aggresive expansionist style and this still rings true.\nI am still dissapointed by the buildings, units and factions. Buildings and units in real terms are limited. The Meta Unit / Army is a good idea but it quickly leads to stronger generic combinations and you then only have a few "unit" options and or combinations which are stronger and worth investing in. This is way short of most RTS games. The buldings, 3 factory types and 1 air factory hardly ground breaking.\n\nOrbitals are good, like the idea and its executed and balanced well.\n\nOnly 2 factions. They are balanced against eachother well so its not blindingly obvious which is stronger which is plus but again I wanted more.\n\nBUT - I have still been enjoying it. I am happy to admit my play style is more towards turtle/researcher than expansionist which doesn't quite fit the AotS mould and this is part of my issue. I cannot play how I would normally, I cannot decide for myself which strategy to use as it doesnt really work with how the game is designed. As such I believe it doesnt quite deliver on the promise.\n\nMy Longest match ( vs AI to test scale ) was over 4 hours and unit cap didnt come into it. It was pretty irrelevant after 1 hr or so with it being large enough ( with enough constant fighting for territory ) to make the game enjoyable. Its like the design of the game actually doesnt play on its USP of massive scale and unit numbers which is just odd.\n\nAnd this is my over riding feeling of the game so far. It looks good, sounds good, its enjoyable and has many positives but its not calling me back time after time to keep playing. I wish there was neautral rather than yes/no.\n\nIt depends what sort of game you are looking for. I would still recommend it as worth trying as I know plenty of RTS gamers will like it. For me it misses the mark a bit.","April 3","false","12.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","2"

The easiest comparison to this came would be supreme commander.\n\nBut supreme commander had three factions that had a unique look and tons of units. Where Ashes just has you level up you armor and weapons, that upgrade in SCFA is an actually new unit. On top of that there were naval options, there were options to set up transport ferry system so your units would rally in one area where a series of drop ships would then pick them up and drop them off automaticly. There were also tons of base defense options. Ashes has a very limited base defense.\n\nWhile saying that, I have been finding myself enjoying this, especialy after I realized that in SC the tier 3 units were nice buy you kind of never touched the other ones again. And there is a certain fun to watching all your missliems and lazers just decimate the other tem. The upgrades for the Dreads is nice  and I do like watching the fights. Wish the wrecks would stick around. Stardock does have a good rep for upgrades and trying to add to there game so huge potential here. I wish there wasa review option between negaive and positive.\n\nBut if you LIked SC and SoaSE then I would recomend purchasing this. . But Only because I have faith in Stardock.","February 26","true","50.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

It seems the AI is a little ramped up as it sits right now.\nDuring the fighting while your trying to survive, the AI is still building more, and still playing the capture game as well.  I have not tried to play the game at a higher level, as it is frustrating enough on easy.\nIts not the AI is smart and out doing me on strategy on easy, its just that it can do 10x more than me, it knows the status of all units and what they are doing, and commands them all at the same time, unlike a human player that has to focus on one thing at a time even only for 1 or 2 seconds, the difference between 1 second and 100 milliseconds is massive, and puts the player at a massive disadvantage.\n\nI sure there will be tuning of the AI in the future, why else is there 8 levels to it.\n\nFor multiplayer, its a blast.\nYep not much to say about Multiplayer, accept that is the reason to get the game now, its a lot of fun.

At least, it's not for me. I've been wanting to learn more aggressive tactics and playstyles, but haven't ever been forced to. In most RTS games I play, I can turtle, build up a huge army, and then go out and essentially conquer them without much problem. Not in this one.\n\nYou can make a base damn near impenetrable, but only as the game gets going, and only if you did a bit of exploration before.\n\nThere is a huge problem with being a turtle right from the start in this game. Most bases have two or three Metal deposits, but no Radioactive deposits. You need radioactive for advanced units, so that presents a major problem to winning if you just turtle it up right away.\n\nSo the early game essentially forces exploration for the sake of advancement and victory.\n\nIt's also not a match about "wiping out the enemy" but rather "holding strategic points until you get enough victory points to win." This also forces expansion, war, vieing for territory, and aggressive tactics.\n\nI'm glad. This is the type of game that seems to both punish and reward exploration, unlike other RTS where exploring just becomes a game of cat and mouse/hide and seek, and usually results in the exploration base being destroyed by an overwhelming force of enemy units before it can recoup the losses spent building it.\n\nIn this, once you've explored and set up an "expansion base" there's no real problem -- you've spent maybe a hundred metal to build the Metal or Radioactive extraction units, and are moving on to the next one in the immediate area to expand your influence and resources while you expand your army.\n\nI've played one game, against AI admittedly, but I've seen no real balance issues besides russing ground bomber ends with me having an extremely early lead, but they catch up quick enough on most maps since I can't expand fast enough to isolate my enemies before they can expand into the nodes.\n\nI highly reccomend this. It's got army expansion sizes beyond 500+, upgrades out the wazoo, tactics enough for people just starting and people that are professionally interested, and it's likely only going to get better.\n\nAs for Early Access, you can also play against the Devs EVERY friday from 4-6 and talk to them about any issues you have with the game, instead of only being able to contact them on the forum or discussion groups area, or through their websites and bug reports.\n\nIf I ever get the chance to, since I have ongoing plans for the forseeable future at those times, I am definitely going to try to join those games.","February 27","true","1.1"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

They spent all that time polishing the engine, but everything else was abandoned half-way. You can’t rebind the controls. There is absolutely no voice overs in game for the campaign, which by the way is only “Episode 1”.  Mechanics are strewn about still needing work.\n\nFor example, the Army system is a very good idea, but is completely unwieldy. Try assigning multiple dreadnoughts to an army and the thing falls apart. Form an army out of a long stream of units and the ones that are about to take the objective will retreat to some centre of gravity. Still haven’t figure out a good way to detach just a few units.\n\nThe mini-map shows an utter contempt for your desire to have situational awareness. Is that coloured blob territory held? A swarm of factory units? A colossal rush of dreadnought?  No idea! Now in Supreme Commander you could just tactical zoom and look at the icons, but if that’s a feature it’s never been explained.\n\nThe audio is completely unhelpful. It says "Enemy Dreadnought Sighted", Great! Where? "Dreadnought taking damage" Which one? I got 7 spread out across the map, no clue which one is taking fire. "Dreadnought taking critical damage", Found it! Oh wait, that enemy dreadnought just fired an alpha burst that wiped out 25% of it's health in 1 second and it's gone. Selecting and ordering units just gives an annoying electronic sound that doesn't lend any kind of personality to the units.\n\nThe campaign is just "Episode 1". All the missions that aren’t tutorials are basically just a skirmish with some wonky starting conditions. The plot basically starts from nowhere and goes nowhere. None of the character have anything approaching personality, and even if they did, it’d be hampered by the fact they can only communicate by texting you in the midst of battle. The mission difficulty is either laughably easy or face smashingly hard. No, you can’t choose a game difficulty, that wasn’t in it.\n\nAll of this was sacrificed for the graphics, which I admit are pretty, but utterly wasted. In Supreme Commander you got a good sense of scale. People know roughly how big a tank, a destroyer or a battleship are. So when you see that giant mechanical spider stomping a tank, you instantly think “Damn, that’s a big unit!”. Ashes’s units are all some weird sci-fi thingy that’s so disconnected from our experience that scale becomes meaningless. I’m sure that dreadnought is big, but I don’t feel it in any meaningful way. It might as well be dots and blobs.\n\nI don’t recommend this game. If you want an epic strategy fix just go replay Supreme Commander. The list of things Supreme Commander had that Ashes of the Singularity doesn’t would easily be as long as this review is.","April 4","false","16.5"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","1"

I really want to like this game, but it just isn’t there yet!!\n\nI own a lot of RTS games including Ashes, Planetary Annihilation, “Titans”, SC and some other titles and PA for me is at this stage much better. I completed the single player of ashes and I was a bit disappointed for a game that was hyped this much. As Brendan mentioned some of the missions you replay and reload saved games and AutoSaves until you are blue. Just a note, sometimes its better just to restart the hole mission!!\n\nThe enemy Dreadnoughts are insanely strong, if you don’t have a Dreadnought of your own you better hope you have an army size of 200+ and a lot of Dreadnought killers and even with this army you will be able to destroy your enemy at the cost of your hole army!! But don’t think your Dreadnoughts are anything as strong as the enemy, they will be wiped out by the most mediocre of armies.\n\nTowers are useless, once again unbalanced as the enemy’s towers can last quite a while if you attack them but your defences are mere bugs they need to wipe from the windshield on their way to kill you.\n\nYou will never have enough resources not even if you own each node on the map. The only time you will have full resources is when you have reached your army cap and nothing builds anymore.\n\nThe thing that bugged me the most was when I create an army or join forces to an existing army the AI goes totally insane. Your units start moving around probably to join up with the slowest strongest unit but if you ordered your army to attack a certain enemy you will see your army turning around and running from the battle. Also in this state your units refuse to obey your commands even if you position the army right next to where the bulk of the units are.\nI do like the graphics of the game and I do believe with some major improvements the game can become enjoyable to the point of SC, PA Titans … At this stage I will not advise anybody to buy this game above SC or PA Titans.\n","April 7","false","16.0"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","1"

This game promises big but in it's current incarnation it fails to deliver.  Had I spent less than £20 and were SupCom never mentioned, I'd probably enjoy this game, but I can't help but feel let down.\n\nFirstly, the positve, The game is very pretty and performance is excellent on my gaming rig. The sound is also fairly immersive, I'm also a big fan of the quadrant system where resources divide up the map.  Saldy, that's pretty much it.\n\nNow for the negative; the single player campaign is boring, completely failing to invest you in the plot. Moreover the mechanics or the campaign are frustrating with a pop-up dialogue which prevents you from performing actions without pausing the game, so a lot of the time you're sitting there reading whilst the enemy is busy heading towards your positions. A recent patch made balance changes to the campaign which were much needed, but addressing the boredom of it all will be a tall order.\n\nThe skirmish is usually where this game excels but again, it just feels very bland.  It's difficult to distinguish units from one another and just feels like a festival of unit spam rather than anything involving tactics or strategy.\n\nThe army mechanic, seems pointless and doesn't really affect the performance of my units, no matter what balance of units I've played around with.\n\nWith Dreadnaughts in an army, it's difficult to select them to Level up, you have to zoom right in to find the one marked by an icon in order to level it, distracting me from the whole battle.\n\nSupCom had a beautiful mechanic allowing you to zoom out to a tactical level, which let you see the whole battlefield in 2D at one glance with units iconized and marked up with information such as firing and detection radii. This game could greatly benefit from such a feature as at present I'm constantly moving the screen from one close up position to the other without really being able to manage the whole battlefield.\n\nMaybe in a year or two this game will be worth buying, but I'd steer clear of it for now.\n\n\n**Update**\nDeveloper has commented that they have never claimed any relationship to SupCom, which is a fair point.  But that doesn't change the fact that every single review talks about it. Sounds like they're a victim of their own hyperbole.  Perhaps it's better to think of this game more with a Sins of a Solar Empire mindset to avoid disappointment.","April 9","false","9.6"," 16 of 31 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","16","31","0","1"

The core of the game is clearly well developed, the graphics are solid and it already performs well in 4k with everything turned up on my dual R9 350 card, though the benchmark confirmed I'm GPU bound 100% of the time still!\n\nThe biggest thing I like after just a couple matches is the slower pace at which the early and mid game unfold, and the way smart use of terrain, vision and army comp are heavily rewarded compared to pumping out units fast in a starcraft style timing attack.\n\nI do feel like each starting base should have a more defensible first radioactives deposit, but otherwise the maps feel like they're in good shape.

Pretty spot on regarding the current abilities of the build. That said, it is equally spot-on in terms of its source material, and this does feel like a soon-to-be bigger and better version of games we've played in the past.\n\nSince I've played TA, Sins, PA, supcom, starcraft, etc, I felt right at home, so maybe here's hoping they put their own twist or spin on it as it goes forward.

Here are some notes:\n*Command issuing is a little bit unresponsive.\n*This is hopefully a bug, but audio seems like it came from flash in 2005. It's weird because the audio files are really high quality and the benchmark showed reasonable audio. Maybe because of DX11.\n*Windows 10 increses preformance no doubt (AMD).\n*Bugs are there, but it's early access so it's almost to be expected.\n*Crashes are to be expected at it's current state.\n\nHas a great potential overall but would not reccomend the 40€ (or your regional equivelent) pricetag while it's in early access.","January 10","true","1.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

The game itself is absolutley amazing!!! I cannot state that enough, because for something to be this amazing in such an early stage is a breath of fresh air from all this crap that gets released these days. If you enjoy any type of RTS game or supreme commander then this game is definatley for you as it smashs the bar set by most futuristic setting RTS's. The gameplay is a slower pace compared to games like supreme commander but the units more than make up for this in numbers and sheer power, which makes battles extremely good to watch and command. With constant updates from the developers this game will be a main stay among RTS fans for many years to come.","January 7","true","1.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

Simple becaue the GAME CHEATS so bad on the final campaign scenario, End Game.\n\nWhen I have 8 or 9 dreadnoughts up against a single ravager and they are pounding it with damage and it is not taking any at all and I for some reason am not able to use any of my global abilities, I say the game is cheating. All of my dreadnoughts started out with more health than that single ravager. I had forgotten about my quanta and increased my health, damage, and range  like 6 levels, when I looked at the ravager it's health also increased, in fact it more than doubled!\n\nThere is more that I noticed while playing the game but there are to many things to recount about how I noticed the game cheating, yes it is that bad.\n\nI enjoy playing single player games and I look forward to the single player campaign in games like this. Unfortunately the single player campaign really looses out. The story line is meh and the story boards that keep popping up during the game get really annoying especially  when you have to click off of them to continue playing. They should at least make it so you can continue to play and control your units during the story pop ups.\n\nBecause of all the above I have to change my recommendation to not recommended at least for the single player games.","March 14","false","279.8"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","8"

I was a huge fan of the TA series and to a lesser extent the Supreme Commander series. This seemed like it was poised to become the next great "army level" RTS. Once I started playing it however I discovered that the content is extremely shallow. There is effectively only 1 faction that has been fleshed out and that faction has such a limited choice of units that the strategy is fairly limiting.\n\nThe concept of being able to form "army groups" and being able to manipulate at a macro scale is a really nifty mechanic and idea. For those of us who aren't big into micro management that makes the game var more pleasent to play.The problem is that there just isn't enough variety to really make it fun.\n\nI really wish I'd not purchased this in early access.

This is a 'buy if you want to support the devs' situation - you are not getting anywhere near £40's worth of game at this point.\n\nThat said, I still cant recomend this game (putting the price asside).\n\nKey reasons I cant recomend:\n\n- Limited Unit tree. 18~ units per side including builders is a poor show in my opinion (I read someone comparing this to supcom, dont make me laugh). Even after reading up, I found nothing on expanding the unit trees.\n- Zoom out has a stupidly low ceiling height for a game which says 'Fight across planets'. It has been confirmed that this won't change either (by a dev on the forums). They feel like they dont want to 'rip off' Supreme Commander's tactical zoom - a choice which is in my opinion a total error. The current zoom ceiling they have is awful.\n- Unit AI is IDIOTIC (units will sit around doing nothing as another unit quite literally next to them is destroyed by an enemy army). This is true as of 02/02/2016 - hopefully this will improve.\n- Unit deaths/explosions are dissapointingly ugly.\n\n\nAll of the above said, this game is way more fun than I origionaly gave it credit for. If they fix the unit diversity (Ideally add another playable faction as well as expanding the current ones) and give more options for resource exploitation this could be a recomend.\n\nEDIT for release:\n\nThe game has changed very little since my previous review, despite now being 'released'. What a shame this is such an underbaked project propped up by the adoration of those willing to accept less (or perhaps I'm much too critical for the poor quality of games which seem to be the norm now).\n\nIf you read things about this game and were pulled in by references to Sup Com; DO NOT BUY.

This game is lacking in areas that even SupCom had done correctly. Though SupCom was’t perfect, it at least had focus firing, individual unit controls, and allowed you to dived grouped units and spilt them into new groups. This game does not. It has so much going for it, but honestly it's lacking in some of the most basic elements that made these grand strategy games so easy to play.\n\nWant to kill that single pesky cruiser before it does any more damage? Nope, can’t focus fire.\n\nWant to move your units to another position? Watch them ever so slowly move then die since you can’t angle and position them correctly.\n\nWant to split off a group from your main army? Can’t do that without reforming your whole army and having all your units scatter!\n\nUnits are hard to control, unit AI isn't very good, lack of focus fire for attacking, lack of splitting "armies" (their version of groups with its own problem), lack of hot keys to select units types, and overly sluggish unit movement. I have not enjoyed this game and I am disappointed that I have to wait for patches to (maybe) fix these problems and a plethora of bugs. Such is modern gaming development. Shove it out of the door and fix it later.\n\nAt this point I do not suggest buying this game. Maybe in the future it will be worth it but right now save your money.\n\nUpdate: A comment to the dev response. No, you cannot. I tried that many times and the orders were ignored by my units. They never focused fired. Either it was a bug or another missing feature that should have been in game. Both of which are unacceptable for the price you pay and for it being a released game. I cannot test this again since I have recived a refund for the game. Now I wish I had recorded my gameplay.

But since we have only the two choices, and I am requesting a refund, it has to be thumbs down.\n\nAs a huge fan of TA/CC/BT, SupCom, FA, SupCom 2 (yes 2), Sins of a Solar Empire w/some xpacs (multiplayer saves! yes thank you!), and a mild fan of PA and PA/Titans, I was super excited about this game and wanted to love it. Bought two licenses to play w/my son (whom I have played all of the above games with).\n\nWe read most of the manual waiting for the game to download and then we played through the tutorial.\n\nSadly, this game doesn't come close to the above games. It has some elements from previous games but doesn't do them as well.\n\nIf you are a fan of the games I listed, especially the TA/SupCom series, read the manual before you buy (I don't know if that's possible).\n\nThe game felt sluggish for me and was missiong keybind controls I've grown used to (adjusting game speed from keys, selecting units of the same type from a key, etc.)\n\nAlso read the developer roadmap. If I had done those 2 things I would not have bought the game. Maybe by the end of 2016 this game might be close to as fun as some of the other games listed. Right now I'm not sure what niche it fills.\n\nOn my i7 920 w/12GB DDR (yes 12GB, triple channel mobo) w/a GTX960 (on which all of the other games just fly and look much better - except PA - that game's graphics are terrible) the game was sluggish and the UI was particularly unpleasant to use.\n\nAlso played on an i5-3570 w/32GB RAM and a HD6870.\n\nSome things I'd like to see:\n\n1. Meaningful unit name (Artemis, Apollo, Nemesis, Zeus, Fury really convey no information).\n2. More unit and structure variety (kbots were lighter, a little cheaper, faster to build, moved faster than vehicles, their engineers built things slower, but they had some variants that you couldn't get in vehicles in TA/supcom). They weren't redundant units, they really did bring something different to the table. How about a navy? Or gunships, or strategic bombers for air - here we get a fighter and a bomber. More variety in defensive structures.\n3. Useful strategic icons\n4. More keybinds (select all units of same type, control game speed, etc.)\n5. Control of the camera angle. Sometimes you want a top down view, sometimes at an angle, sometimes close to the ground.\n6. Experimentals or meaningful research. +% damage, +% health is a start but shows lack of creativity. Camera shells, direct fire artiller, legs on ships, long range artiller, gunships, etc. those are all cool creative upgrades that require creativity and more work in balancing but make the game way more interesting.\n7. Much more responsive UI. This really shouldn't be so sluggish on these PCs.\n\nOverall, my opinion is if I pay $50 for a new RTS, it really needs to be at least as much fun as the ones I've played before, and have at least most of the features/capabilities of its much older predecessors. I mean you have so much prior art to be inspired from, you get to stand on the shoulders of giants that have come before.\n\nI like Stardock and hope they do well with this game, but we're requesting refunds. May not get them because we left the tutorial paused while we had dinner so it logged 3 hours played which is past the 2 hr limit for refunds, but we'll see. Definitely not worth $50 a pop for me at this moment.","April 3","false","3.4"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","1"

It's early release!\nHow often do we hear that particular line of reason in Beta? Ashes is very good to look at and, in terms of campaign and story very unfinished, as you would expect. It suffers from comparison with supreme commander which, given its development, might be unfair.\nMy alarm comes from something very basic: the AI engine. I don't think it is up to scratch because it's just a swarm game, there's no finesse to it and no opportunity to outmanouvre the enemy. As with so many games of this genre the game is made difficult by allowing the AI to cheat in resourcing and exploiting the fact that the human eye can't encompass the whole map but the computer can.\nThat said, I didn't mind paying the reduced price and have mildly enjoyed the graphics, sound and familiar feel. Lets hope it will get better with less linear mapping and more tactical gameplay. If there was a button for yes and no I'd use that, it just about gets a cautious thumbs up.\n\nI have down graded the game. It's not going to get better, in spite of what I say above, because the the AI is useless. Plyed on the beginner setting it's absurdly easy, raise one level and the AI goes into cheat mode. I haven't even bothered with normal. It's possible to be defeated even if you own 3/4 of the resources on the map and outnumber the enemy; one enemy dreadnought easily destroys two of your own even if you're supported by repair facilities and fixed defences. The AI can also attack on several fronts and a human can't keep up because your own forces don't have AI behavior. Even in a narrow defile your troops ignore an enemy who can get past and cause havoc in your rear territory.\n\nThe game is big on eye candy and low on good design.","October 28, 2015","false","24.8"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","4","9","0","0"

And if you were panning about the battlefield when this happened, the camera glitches and continues to pan in that direction indefinitely until you hit that key again.\n\nDue to the text-based dialogue, I found it incredibly difficult to empathise with the characters, as I was too busy commanding my army to have much time for reading.\n\nThe game also seems to take forever to load into the main menu, but is then fast to load everywhere else, another gripe I have is that the volume slider for the music also controls the volume for the cutscenes. So if you are like me, and you turn the music down or off while you play, you will have little or no sound in your cutscenes.\n\nThe difficulty curve is strange, I'm on the second last campaign mission now, and I appear to be stuck. I've played against and beaten mutiple opponents in previous missions, but now it is me and my 2 allies vs 1 enemy, and we just get steamrolled every time. It doesn't help that the guide character tells you to build bombers and just attack the enemy HQ, a tactic which I assume would have worked in a previous version of the game, before the bombers were nerfed, but as it is, it's completely ineffective and all the time and resources you put into those bombers only to see them wiped out, means you will likely have to restart the mission.\n\nBased on my experience, I would not recommend this game in it's current state, there are a lot of issues that I don't feel should have made it into the production version, I assume and hope they will be fixed in future patches.\n\nI have not played the multiplayer, only the campaign.","April 13","false","10.6"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","1"

Actually i think this game is more like a good and big direct x 12 and multicore showcase as a product in progress. It seems that maybe some functions can be purchased in future as a dlc.\n\n+++ third impression: its a hybris to promote this game as a prosecution of "total anhiliation or supreme commander", because this game have´nt  many of the functions or concepts of this great predecesor.\n\nFurther, if i compare this 50 Euro early access beta game with the actually Homeworld: desert of kharak, i see realy, many, big differences about the unit design, functionalitys, the story, the world rendering design, the intel functions and so on. So here i mean it is totaly unrealistic to pay 50 euros for this small and evidently unfished game!\n\nWell, this game have a good marketing concept,\n\nit sounds like a hype\nif you read some about Ashes of singlularity,\n\nyou may think **wow**, i want this game ... , but in the end , if you bought this beta game, you can - will miss a lot of things.\n\n\n*** So i dont recommend this early access for 50 euro or 60 $ this is not a complete game! ****\n\nThe good things:\nthis game have a nice concept about research and the resources. It have also a great and outstanding multicore performance with hundreds - thousends of units. Nice job! The air fighter animation is great. This pretty game approach is more for shorter games round 1h and not for epic games like SFCA with 5 hours and more (ok well on 40 km or greater maps)\n\nThe critics:\n\nBut sry, the unit behaviour is very simple (a group have no reaction to a near attacking emeny), or you cannot create a multible point patrol path, it exists no dual screen option, and you cannot zoom out the game map like supreme commander. Or how can i change the camera view to the ground to consider topological terrain attributes ? The military intel is also strange, some middle range units does not attack some enemy base defense, here i miss this middle range option like the SC lvl 2 artillerie.\n\nWell,for me the supreme commander ui is a realy good standard (a quasi RTS concept). Also the unit design is simple with only few details, partly questionable and seems like a directX 8  rendering, expects the lightning FX.\nIts very difficult to select a air unit, whats is about useabilty here ?\nI miss also a middle range artillerie or rockets. What is about a static radar intel without on demand functionality ? So this is that i mean with the arcade style in the context of Supreme Commander (forged alliance) ;-)\n\nCheers","March 16","false","9.1"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","1"

It is currently a skirmish editor and very little else.  It promises of  releasing in the near future a 'campaign' across planets....best to wait and see if that makes this game unique.  Otherwise this game has the same tactics and units as every other RTS since C&C.  It does support gargantuan sized armies and this is why the specs may be a lead weight for some rigs.  In my opinion I doubt the campaign will do little more than story stitch a series of lifeless maps.  The game would benefit greatly with maps that have combat effecting terrain.\n\nThe Early Adopters gamble that all this will pay out when the missing features do show up, seem to be the only excitement in this game.\n\nUPDATE:  Better maps now exist.  Terrain has elevation, not sure if there are true benefits.  Units dont seem to get stuck or fail to obey movement commands.  Better.  Units are more interesting and do feel updated vs the older TA types.  Improved and prettier than TA, but still TA.

(28/2/16).\n\nI was really looking forward to this game. When it went down to £20 (-50% off) I had to buy it.\n\nI was expecting a relatively good beta mainly because of reviews read and the price. I was a bit disappointed.\n\nThe game itself looks quite ugly on the highest settings. For some reason I couldn't achieve the high resolution appearance of the screenshots.\n\nScrolling the map is stuttery. The maps themselves look quite messy. The location of resources is a bit naff although I can see why they placed them there. I think it's down to the poor design of maps.\n\nI was expecting a ton of units, even for this stage, but there is very few apparently. There is also very limited research to be done.\n\nAll in all I was disappointed. I would not recommend buying this game now and definitely not for £40. I find that price outrageous.\n\nWith that said, I will keep an eye on it. If I find my main concerns are addressed, I will likely purchase this game as it has a great deal of potential.","February 28","false","1.9"," 10 of 22 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","10","22","0","0"

That's not a bad thing if we were talking about an 'Very Hard' difficulty, but not normal.\n\n\nI hyped this game up a lot to my friends who had never played a Stardock game, then had to turn around and tell them not to bother because I know they would never beat the AI in a single match with their lesser RTS experience.

Even in skirmish mode, the voice acting (where they have it) is amatuer at best. Units make the same sound every time you click on them. No variation.\n\nUnit  animations also need polish. For example, the Apollo unit for the PHC faction. One of its AA attacks is a green laser. It has no sound and looks like a simple green line drawn in AutoCAD. Just absolute potato.\n\nThe "thousands of units" thing is simply not the case. While this is technically possible in game, you will finish most missions with around 200 or 300 units on screen. Maybe less. 1000 isn't even necesary.\n\nThere are several technical and optimization issues. I get that any game on launch will have bugs, but come on. 40 fps on a gtx 970 on high settings? Doesn't seem right.\n\nLastly, as others have mentioned. there are a few massive difficulty spikes at about 3 different parts in the campaign.

The campaign is a tutorial.  I understand that games have to include tutorials so first timers know how to play. Fine.  AotS takes the tutorial to a whole new level.  First of all, you can select "Tutorial" from the main menu and learn all about the game.  But if you choose to play the campaign, your game will be repeatedly inturrupted by an illegible text box that prevents you from actually playing the game until you click enought times to dismiss it (meanwhile your opponent is still active).  This is infuriating as it will actually pull you to another area on the map as you are trying to build up your defenses or attack your opponent.  What's worse is that in late game, you will recieve tutorial messages about units and structures that YOU HAVE ALREADY USED IN PREVIOUS MISSIONS!!! Love how I've already annihilated an enemy with dreadnaughts only to have a tutorial about dreadnaughts on the second to last mission...\n\n2. Loading a save game.  You actually have to quit the game to load a previous save.  WTF!?!\n\n3. Bugs.  I can't count the number of times that I've have restart a mission or load a save from over an hour before because all of a sudden my factories couldn't produce units or my engineers progress was frozen or an enemy dreadnaught just couldn't be hit.  I got so tired of this happening that I thought I'd enjoy myself more by writing a review...\n\nWhile not totally game breaking, I also find that my speed settings tend to fluctuate.  I'll set the game speed  to "slow" so I can  order a bunch of engineers around, only to have it set itself back to "normal" or even "fast" when I'm being attacked.\n\nBeing able to hold Shift to assign multiple orders is pretty much a staple of the RTS genre,  It would be nice if it worked all the time in AotS.\n\n4. Scale.  This game promises massive, crazy huge battles unseen in any RTS (really, a benchmark test on the main menu?).  True, the unit cap can be huge.  But you'll never reach it.  And why would you want to?  The maps are claustrophobic; full of ravines and mountains to channel your troops into useless columns as they march towards their deaths.  Not conducive of the large scale battles that were promised by developers (and achieved by SupCom). Your units move rediculously slow through most terrain, but God forbid you try to climb a hill.  I found myself speeding the game up just to get over a little hump (BTW all the units hover! WTF?!)\n\n5.We tell you how to play.  This is my biggest gripe about this game.  The developers had  an idea of how this game should be played, and we're all beholden to it.  All of these stupid restrictions during missions: Oh, all of a sudden I get no amplifiers? Hey, why not arbitrarily just take out ground defenses? Done!\n\nNo Workshop?  Really? Is it pride? Did you create the perfect game and no one can mess with it?  SoaSE was modded and was great!

I also broke my rule of not every buying early access games. I regret both.\n\nThis game certainly has potential. The gameplay seems like it could be really interesting if expanded, but right now it's monotonous. There's also barely a difference between the two factions, as far as I can tell. You don't micro in this game, and it was designed that way, so I'll leave the judgement of that to you. That leaves the macro mechanics to differentiate the factions. And boy, the macro mechanics are pretty much identical.\n\nAt this early access stage, it's also missing so much and doesn't feel performant. The lighting quality is abyssmal for the amount of graphics power this game uses. I run a GTX 970 overclocked, the game averages <30fps on the benchmark at max settings. I get better frames in Rome II, and that game looks stunning compared to this. Hell, Dota looks stunning compared to this. There is a problem with either the video memory management or the input-to-output chain, causing some noticable lag. But this is early access, so I'm sure they'll fix it. Eventually.\n\nThe game's got potential. Don't buy this until it's actually released.","February 2","false","3.0"," 4 of 12 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","4","12","0","1"

Unfortunately not much has improved.\n\nZooming in and out of the map you have two options; I-Can-See-Your-Nostril-Hairs, or In-A-Galaxy-Far-Far-Away (you can see outside the universe). This seriously breaks the game (you can see the sky texture wrap around the bottom of the world).\n\nThat pretty effectively eliminates any possible gameplay as neither option works well for RTS.\n\nThe "Campaign" is cumbersome and the "guidance" is more of a nusance. Oftentimes the game will take control while you're in the middle of doing something, pan you halfway to timbucktu. The only saving grace is that when it's done molesting your free-will, it puts the camera back.\n\nThe dialogue that guides you through the game is modal and prevents you from doing anything else until you've clicked through the text. And then of course once you have control again, the text is gone so you better hope you were paying attention to what needs to be done!\n\nBasic UX stuff.

That is it has very little to do with actual strategy and more to do with just spamming the same units. But this isn't always a bad thing on its own; After all there are a lot of other areas where a game can fail to be good and just end up mediocre.\n\nBut Ashes has a good deal of mediocrity to it:\n-lacluster and blocky units\n-low levels of detail\n-underwhelming graphics\n-only a handfull of different units\n-Stale gameplay\n-the list goes on...\n\nUnfurtunately this game has some things that work to make it more on the bad side as well such as its horrendously high requirements for such low levels of performance... higher level GPUs are needed if you want a decent frame rate and nothing in the game warrants such requirements. I mean the units are low poly-count, low detail and weapons fire is as underwhelmin as it could look in addition to maps that aren't anything special. So why does it have such high needs?\n\nThe crashes, OMG the crashes. Good luck getting it past the tittle screen.\n\nThey said this was a succesor to su[reme commander and they lied completely. There's nothing here that gives you any sence of emense units or lots of them since the economy barely allows you to build anything and the number of structures/units is a joke. No shields, no stealth, just your basic land and air units; and i do mean basic units... Even the so called dreadnaughts are pitiful, barely more powerfull than cruisers. (what happened to everything between cruiser and dreadnaught anyway?) There is no naval side to this at all either so your units are:\n\n-2 air\n-3 small land\n-4 medium land\n-3 large land\n\nBase defences are worthless as well, they have no health and only tickle their targets. But that can be mitigated by using units to defend.\nThey also lied about having thousands of units. Just outright lied.\nAnd another damning element is the fact that you cannot under any cercumstance direct your units to fire on any specific unit in an enemy's army. All you can do is have them attack the army as a whole and watch as they spread the damage as much as possible instead of focusing on the dangerous parts. :(\n\nAnyway, this game isn't a completely bad one but it won't give you a challenge, it won't wow you, and it wont impress you in the slightest. It will bore you very quickly as well. Nothing about it hasn't been done, and been done better, before.\n\nSo do I recommend it? No, it's not worth more than a few dollars honestly but it might entertain you for a little while.","May 13","false","21.5"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","1"

A few major grievances I have are of a fairly specific nature, the kind that may or may not matter to you.  I'll just run down a simple pros and cons list and you can judge for yourself.\n\nPros:\n*Every unit has a place\n\n*Every building has a place\n\n*DirectX12 graphics allow for some of the best visual fidelity I have seen in years for a strategy game\nMaps are grand in scale, with a unique Line of Sight Fog of War system that lends to the techy future this game tries to convey\n\n*The use of actual strategy comes with fantastic rewards, high ground is in fact very hard to take, and very easy to hold.  Sightlines are paramount to success.  You can tell they put a lot of thought into how to make sure you think about what you do before you do it.\n\n\nCons:\nCampaign lacks intrique - Text dialogue mixed with no "real" cinematics makes it feel like a string of custom games more than a story worth re-telling\n\n*While every unit has a unique purpose, they do not have a very unique look, some displaced colors and an extra prop here or there are all that seem to seperate the bulk of your forces.\n\n*Their attempt to rid the player of micro-managing so that they can focus on the grand strategy lends one to believe that the AI can handle it for you...it can not, it is VERY unintuitive, the units will mass into formations as best as the terrain allows, but will attempt to maintain those formations at the cost of winning a skirmish.\n\n*Air combat is a joke.  Most bombers lack the damage to put a dent in economy structures, how do they plan on taking down a factory.\n\n*The Speed of it (BELOW YOU WILL SEE A BOX OF OUTLINED PARAGRAPHS TO ALL THE WAYS THEY SLOWED THIS GAME DOWN...it is hands down the reason I finished the campaign, and then just turned the game off\n\n----------------------------------------\n*Units are VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY DAMN SLOW!  Massive maps at normal speed can take mulitple minutes to cross, at a pace like this I am almost guarenteed to lose because by the time my units get somewhere I'll be asleep for the action.  This also heavily impacts your ability to respond to an escalated attack from the enemy, if they find a blind spot, they'll push halfway through your lines before you can even get units to meet them in combat due to their travel time.\n\n*Their attempt to rid the player of micro-managing so that they can focus on the grand strategy lends one to believe that the AI can handle it for you...it can not, it is VERY unintuitive, the units will mass into formations as best as the terrain allows, but will attempt to maintain those formations at the cost of winning a skirmish.  They will drive in circles trying to create formations before they even attempt to move...this drastically impacts combat where you need to rapidly respond to an enemy attack.\n\n*Combat takes forever...Understanding that the idea behind this was to create a somewhat grand scale war going on, where strategy was more important than micro, the implentation was a disaster.  To aid their own design for creating massive armies they appear to have simply maded it harder for units to die.  Very low damage with very high HP makes almos ever fight a slugfest between vehicles.\n\n*Maps lack that certain sparkle.  Textures, lighting, and geometry are top notch; however, there is almost a complete absence of a "doodad" layer and the prop-less terrain seems bland and repetitive (like a drive through kansas)...you have winter, and you have not winter....thats about as diverse as it gets.  (This unfortunately lends to the slow pace feel the game has, its like a boring war in a boring environment)\n----------------------------------------------\n\nHope this helps guys.","May 1","false","20.4"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","1"

There's not a lot of depth or strategy to the game.  The good ol' tank rush is alive and well.  The graphics are ok, although a bit amateurish.  In fact, that adequately describes the game in general.  Not much of a story, and when it's told it's through a mix of unbalanced audio and text.  And the annoying thing about the text is that you have to click to move passed it.  So if a text sequence shows up during a battle, it can be quite frustrating since you have to quickly click through the messages in order to interact with your units again.\n\nThe game is also quite buggy.  Audio issues, armies not forming correctly, control groups getting unassigned at random, lockups and crashes, just to name a few.  Needs a little more QC.\n\nIf you're looking for a good RTS game, keep looking.

Units just float. The maps are void of anything. Its just a blob vs blob war. Planes circle like helicopters.\n\nThis game is about a 4.7-5.3/10,  (edit 3 April 2016: new score 6.3-6.7 see below in comments). My score takes a big hit because I expect a single player that reflects the intro video. If the dev decides to go half way by skimping out on single player, he should say so in advance. People don't buy potential and this feels unfinished and rushed.\n\nThe resource system mechanics are needlessly repetative when developing a node which doesn't add to gameplay. Advertising is focused too much on showing graphic effects on high end machines. Instead of seeing gameplay mechanics in videos, we see blobs of flashy lights. Game plays like blob warfare with little player involvement other than trying to get a general balanced blob to move forward and capture another node. Looks good in videos to see flashy lights on a high end machine but playing it is bland. Get more nodes and push your blob forward.\n\nI have been gaming forever. Since the CnC days. If you want a great RTS, play Act Of Aggression, especially the Reboot edition which is now included for free.","March 31","false","54.0"," 11 of 29 people (38%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","38","11","29","2","5"

I love Sins of a Solar Empire and I figured Stardock would do a great job with this too but honestly I don't see what all the hype is about.  Sins is a much better game and this game just has nothing that other games don't and it's even lacking in some areas I find.  I mean the win condition of the "control the resource node" is nice but this seems to be just a spamfest of whoever pumps out the most units the fastest or whoever gets the first leveled up dreadnaught.  Speaking of dreadnaughts all you really need is a group of them and you're good, kind of kills the whole strategy thing when all you have to do is build the big units and you're alright.  There could at least be a little more variety in them instead of only having 3 each.  I mean take Sins for instance, with few exceptions you really do want all of the capital ships in a fleet and no matter how many you spam there's still great use for a lot of the smaller craft even though they die a lot.  But in Ashes the smaller units just get sneezed on by dreads and poof they're gone, not even a point.\n\nBut let's talk about the selling point... massive scale battles with thousands of units and dreadnaughts that are 57 miles long woo!  Just no, it doesn't matter how big the unit is in the game world when it's half an inch on your screen and the map size is 20 feet. (just random numbers thrown in there)  And thousands of units?  Why when a group of 6-8 dreads will blow up basically everything?  Sure you can't put them in an "army" so they won't benefit from each others auras and what not but still... the difference in unit classes is too much.  And back on the massive scale thing.. there have been other games that do the massive scale better, in my opinion Sins is one of them.\n\nSo how about base building?  I kind of like what they did with the "grid" or "network" of resources but at the same time I feel like it's more of a downer.  It's a neat new thing sure but in practice I don't really like it.  I also found the PHC repair bays to be slightly over powered, especially when you can drop one or several of those "temporary" railgun turrets next to one and they never expire (because "temporary" in this case means it loses health until it's dead) and my gosh those things own.\n\nI really can't recommend this game, especially at the current price of $40 USD.  I feel like maybe for $10... but not really because again, nothing here that other games don't do better and nothing new holding me to it.","April 28","false","8.9"," 0 of 6 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","6","0","0"

Total Annihilation, Command and Conquer, Homeworld, Supreme Commander, Demigod, Kohan, Sins of a Solar Empire, and on and on.\n\nThis game plays very much like a dumbed down version of Supreme Commander.  The node system while interesting didn't expand strategic decisions.  The node system just seemed to limit where you could move on the map.  If you have control of some areas where there is only one route in and out, those rear areas are safe from attack and you can just build defenses further forward.\n\nThe Titan units rule the battlefield and are interesting, but sadly you can obtain them within a couple of minutes.  Contrary to what other people describe as a more casual game my experience seemed fast and clicky.  The strategy boiled down to expand quick.  Find a bottleneck.  Defend there (defenses are weak and drop quickly) and build Titans as quick as possible.  Send large army forward to roll.  Keep adding in more reinforcements.  Keep your army together.  If you split your forces and they meet up with a bigger army they will be gone within 30 seconds or so.  There is no chance for adjusting once you commit to battle.\n\nIf you like a simpler strategy game that moves at a good clip and lets you engage with a lot of units then this is the game for you.  If you want something deeper, I recommend going back to Forged Alliance.","April 27","false","2.8"," 1 of 9 people (11%) found this review helpful","11","1","9","0","1"

I went against my instincts to buy this game I knew I shouldn't have bought it. Before I bought it I thought there would be some kind of odd compatibility issues, and sure enough I was right.\n\nI really liked the videos I found online about it.\n\nSadly the game just endlessly loads the only help I've found are various repetitive not very helpful instructions such as validate the game go into settings, and update drivers etc. I bought this game my other games work fine there's no reason why this game shouldn't work period.

Sadly no.\n\nGraphics: Still need to restart the game if you change anything at all. Even things like AA etc.. which really only takes a context restart. The problem here (guesstimating since I don't see the source code) is that I suspect the graphics code is integrated with game logic. So if you change anything, and a restart is needed, the logic breaks because it too needs a restart. The solution here is to move the graphics engine to a separate thread, away from the main game logic. Then they can recreate the context to their hearts content. I have no idea how possible it is to move at this stage, it might very well be impossible due to the sheer volume of rewrite. If so, I hope they take this away as a lesson learned for the future. Keep in mind that I am talking about DX12. I haven't tested the non dx12 version, and frankly I can't be bothered at this stage.\n\nSluggishness: Still remains, but like I said, the game itself is good. It is just so annoying with these other aspects that playing something that have the response time of playing a game remotely across the planet, simply is too distracting. I won't say much here about it, more further down.\n\nFont: The blurriness because font is scaled, rather than native for the chosen resolution makes the text barely readable at lower resolution. Which you will need for performance (below)\nFor the devs: Choose a table of font resolutions, so that for low res you might have 6x4 pixels font, higher 8x5, 12x8 and so on. So that a series of resolutions up to a certain level get a higher native font resolution. Set the scales so that the font doesn't appear too little, or too large for the range of resolutions. It takes a while to get that table, but it is well worth it. So please do that.\n\nPerformance: (Relates to sluggish above) It still is very hungry. For what reason I have no idea. I could compare with my own project, but it would serve little purpose. I am just very curious what they are doing that consumes this massive amount of performance. Because it seems it doesn't matter what resolution, or graphical settings I set. It is still massively slow. I have a GTX 780 which can play pretty much anything over or at 60 fps. Certainly if I set the settings right. But this?? I don't know. I wish I could say something that could help these guys getting this performance right, but it is so long now.. I don't know.\n\nThere are also typical issues like low angle shadow artifacts, but those exist in pretty much any game. etc.. I consider those minor, and wont bring them up.\n\nSo there it is.. the update really doesn't change much of the things I find so annoying that it detracts from having fun playing the game. Which is terrible, I find the story interesting, and I really would like to enjoy playing it. But i just cannot see past the issues above. Because I certainly wont fork out $$$ for a GTX Titan just to get playable performance.\n\nFinal words this time:\n\nThe game does seem interesting (story wise) the music is good and enjoyable, even if repetitive after a while. The graphics quality is really good, sound is good and if it were not for the things above, I would have very little bad things to say about it. If it had not been for the issues above, I would have happily recommended this game. But I cannot in good conscience recommend a game I honestly cant play properly.","April 1","false","2.0"," 0 of 9 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","9","0","2"

Two primary resources exist as metal and radioactives. The maps host resource nodes from which metal and radioactives may be harvested. A map is essentially a series of paths along which resource nodes are dispersed. A third type of resource called "turinium" may be harvested from unique nodes on the maps. Turinium can be accumulated as vicotory points, for which a set number awards victory to the first player to accumulate said amount. The additional victory condition is a nice alternative and can be switched off if desired.  "Research" is realized through the generation of a resource called "quanta". Quanta is developed by structures which are not dependent on any resource nodes on the map. Players will likely build their quanta generators as far away from the "front" as possible. Quanta can be used to upgrade your combat units globally (every unit built gets the upgrade that is researched). Quanta can also be used to generate temporary effects, including area-of-effect types of weapons against opponents or boosts to ones own units.\n\nMaps: As mentioned, the maps are a series of paths, similar to a simple maze. Non-player "neutral" units can be made to oppose the players in the early stages of expansion, as desired. The maps have natural choke-points, as the paths will force players to choose from perhaps one or two avenues towards their opponents.\n\nUntis: Air units include fighters and bombers. There are basic land units: tanks, artillery, anti-air. There are "super-units" represented by Dreadnaughts. The dreadnaughts are the most interesting units, as they gain experience and can be individually upgraded by the player. Players can create battle groups comprised of any number and type of differents units. The developers claim that these battle groups perform cohesively to the best of their collective ablilies. The dreadnaughts will boost other units within their battle groups.\n\nPlay: I played two games against the A.I. with a friend on my team. Everything is pretty straightforward. Expand along the paths, building harvesting structures along the way. Bear in mind that there is not much room for "base-building" here. The paths determine your trajectory and there are three defensive structures: anit-air, anti-dreadnaught, and anti-land. Build factories to make units for armies (land, air, dreadnaught), and structures to generate research. Use quanta (research) for global upgrades and/or temporary effects during battle. I found myself queing up balanced forces from multiple factories, land, air, and dreadnaught. I rampaged through the paths with one army which was constantly being reinforced with fresh units by my production facilities. I found myself building structures on the map, queing up a balanced mix, queing up global upgrades, and occasionally adjusting the movement path of my army. I rarely watched the battles, checking only that I continued to win with few losses. Synopsis: I spent an hour of clicking through menus and buttons with very little immersion into strategy or tactics. This could change against a smarter opponent: a human player that uses aircraft to take out my quanta facilities perhaps. Supply lines can be cut (?), but we never suffered this setback. The pace of the armies when compared to the distance needed to be travelled could encourage forethought. This is a promising aspect of the game, but I never felt that I needed to think about multiple points of depolyment for future engagements. I just went for the throat (the enemy's home base). A player loses the game, by the way, if their home base is destroyed. The game feels small and simple to me, not to suggest that I am so skilled with RTS. More appropriately, I felt that there were few decisions to make. I found the play quite bland , so much so that I doubt I will play the game again.\n\nPerformance: I encountered limited issues with performance on an Intel CORE I7 and GEForce GTX 770m. I encountered no noticiable bugs. The game seemed quite polished.","April 27","false","2.7"," 0 of 10 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","10","0","1"

I had genuinely been looking forward to this game but holy h*ll.  I don't know it it is just me but the words chr*st f*ck were repeated at an alarming frequency.  The initial few "campaign" levels do a good job at teaching you the basic mechanics of the game.  Unfortunately it is what I assume was the fourth mission/planet that everything goes to hell in a hand basket.\n\nYou start off with the knowledge that you must capture and hold some sort of special reactor/facility which in an of itself isn't bad.  Unfortunately the lack of resources pretty much make it a necessity to expand early on I found.  This is timed almost flawlessly by the first wave of hostile units and is almost guaranteed to outnumber your own force.  If you are lucky you can get by with minimal losses only to have the second and third waves barrelling down on your base.\n\nIf you can secure a position, it become tolerable until you are made aware that the enemy is producing air units.  This wouldn't be so bad if 1) the air units couldn't one shot your engineers and 2) the AA defense buildings you get could be built in time to catch the air units before they started bombing everything in your base.  Now your only real hope is the AA cruiser which trust me, don't really seem to cut it.  Now, if you can somehow survive that the enemy begins ramping up their attacks making the defensive buildings you had next to useless but don't worry, once everything seems hopeless you can build healing stations and medics, great if you don't mind placing them away from front lines.\n\nI managed to get to this point and genuinely believed that I might catch a break but it was here that all of my combat units decided to start ignoring orders.  You want us to retreat to the healing station so we don't die?  Better rush the enemy!  You want us to move to the right to counter the incoming enemy wave?  Let's chase down these remaining units to the left instead.  I checked to make sure that my mouse was actually clicking in the right place (it was) but my units just seemed determined to commit mass suicide out of range of my healing stations.\n\nAfter restarting the mission six different times I can honestly say that this was far too painful a purchase.  Perhaps multiplayer or skirmishes will be simpler but I really don't care to find out.  I do not advise buying this game, rather I advise avoiding it and praying the company loses money.  Maybe then they will make a better game in the future.\n\n\n-----\n\nyutt, my apologies about the lack of paragraphs.  When I had written this I was rather exhausted from the whole thing and posted it without breaking it down.  I will attempt to keep that in mind for next time.\n\n\nIslandDog, I am a little worried you may have gotten the wrong impression.  My issue is not with the difficulty, rather quite the opposite.  I am quite fond of challenging games.  My issue is with one of the game mechanics that I feel needs to be fixed or removed to make this game better.  When playing, you occasionally get a "pop-up" window from one of your superiors/intel officers giving you details or making you aware of what is going on (for instance when they warn you that the enemy is producing air units on the fourth mission/planet).\n\nI am not against this but it prevents the player from scrolling or panning the screen, issuing movement, attack, or construction commands, or otherwise doing anything but click through the info all while the enemy is capable of continuing on unhindered.  This would be fine if the game was a turn based strategy as then it would not be taking away precious seconds or even minutes that could be used to reinforce ones defense or offense capabilities.  As it stands though, the game is a real time strategy meaning that everything should be happening at once.  To pause the game only for the player and not the computer controlled forces when these alerts happen gives the ai an unfair and unneccesary advantage.\n\nIf you were to follow the styles of command and conquer, starcraft, or supreme commander you could put these notifications in as videos or just have them scroll by without interfering with the gameplay.","March 31","false","4.9"," 2 of 19 people (11%) found this review helpful","11","2","19","0","2"

But that micromanagement, ill-advised as it was, was still a gameplay element. Sadly, Stardock didn't think to replace that lost gameplay with anything else. Imagine playing Starcraft, but without unit management. All you'd be left to do is click factories and build units.\n\nAnd that's what AotS is. Click the factory, build the unit, repeat.\nBut to be fair, I only did the tutorial-- which may not have provided me with a good look at the meat of the game. Alas-- the steam refund policy requires me to set this one aside without ever finding out. And that's hardly Valve's fault-- Stardock had their chance to show me what they had. And they either failed to show off their gameplay in 30 minutes, or they succeed in showing me they had no game for me to play.","May 6","false","0.9"," 18 of 68 people (26%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","26","18","68","5","52"

While I do understand that it is indeed a "early access game" charging near AAA price for it is alittle to much. $20 would be a fair price for what you get as you are basically testing the game for them so they dont have to. $30 might be ok but even that would be pushing. All in all not bad for what little you get but not worth the price. Would rather just go buy Gal Civ if i didnt already own it. Will be returning this game after posting this review because, even though I am a big stardock fan this game is not worth the price tag for what you get.

Here's some of the more important points to consider before buying or not.\n\nThe Good:\n\nAmazing graphics:  Leading edge graphics.  If you want better graphics than this game has go watch the new Star Wars movie.\n\nOrbitals:  You have a slew of possible orbital abilites you can "call down" and use for a mydrid of offence, defence and support.  They add a lot more possible strategies.\n\nArmies:  You can set your groups to make "armies", which move together at the same speed in formations, and change position and tactics based on the situation.\n\nAuto Build/Join:  My favorite Pro of the game.  While you have a group or amry highlighted, you can also access all possible unit's build menus, ordering what units you want built.  In addition (and this is the great part) when built, those units travel to that army, and automatically join it.  I almost had a cigarette and laid back in bed when I first saw this happen.\n\nThe stately pace:  This may be a personal Pro, but this game is far more about thinking ahead and planning, rather than twitch and reaction time.  No amount of ninja clicking will get you out of your bad decissions in this game.\n\nThe "Meh":\n\nBland, lifeless maps:  While the unit graphis are amazing, the terrain on maps are barren and bland.  You'll feel like your playing on a huge golf course or acers of tundra fields.\n\nThe UI:  The UI "works".  The game's mini map "works".  The lists of players, stats, units, resoursces and scores "work".  But that's about all they do.\n\nUnit differenciation: You may have a lot of problems telling your units from an allie's units, or worse, telling an enemie's from yours if it's the same faction (until they fire on you).  The player color choices are subtle and a bit drab, and unit types are sometimes very hard to identify until zoomed in.  There are no icons or symbols on units when you zoom out, just dots.\n\nThe Campaign:  The campain is ok.  Barely just ok.  It's better than nothing.  A very basic story, with chat boxes occationally interupting your game to text out a plot point.  The missions designs themselves are above average though, and will give you a very good challenge at times.\n\nNo replays.  Enough said.  If you play a game of this with your friends, get ready to "remember" what happend, not watch it.\n\nAttack/Defence:  You can use some of your "Quanta" to increase the Attack or Defence rating of units.  A throwback choice from old games which does nothing but cancel each other out.\n\nThe Bad'ish:\n\nLess options & units:  You won't find many of the units or possible strategies that you would in TA or SC.  There are no shields; no artillery (except for dreadnaughts); no super units; no "super weapons that end the game unless you stop them"; no placement bonuses; and a below average selection of units to build.\n\nResource busywork:  There could be many dozens of resourse nodes to gain control of and mine on a map, and multiple nodules per node, and they all need an engineer to be specically told to build each and every nodule.  This can become even more tedius and frustrating, as enemies destroy your mines, and you have to hunt down which are destroyed and then micro an engineer to rebuild each of them.\n\nBeta-like bugs:  There are still problems with the game that you would expect to see in a late stage beta.  It's often difficult (or impossible) to find a location to build a building, as there is no visual cue as to where it possible.  You just move your mouse round and round till the building turns from red to blue.  Groups and armies aften get mixed up; move in different directions; or freeze entirely.  Build cues for engineers often vanish after you spent a minute carefully placing them.  Lag and stuttering can plague a game even on the smallest maps and lowest video settings (even with solo play).\n\nWell?:\n\nThis is one of those times when I lothe the Yes/No recommendation you are forced to choose when reviewing games on Steam.  If I could grade this game, I would give it a C, with a "crystal ball" potential of B in the future.  But there is no such choice.  So I will give a thumbs up (which I wish was a thumbs sideways) for now.\n\nFor more details, there are untold amounts of YouTube videos to help you decide if you wish to see if this is the game for you or not.","March 9","true","102.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","3"
