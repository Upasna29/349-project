There is an added degree of difficulty in hunting down my opponent's troops when I only know where they are if his troops are within the field of vision of my own, but the game plays and feels just like a strategy board game.  Each army unit is even a play "piece" with a wooden base included at the bottom and it feels like I am moving a miniature around on a board-type map.\n\nThe music is really pretty and kind of relaxing and after having played it for a few hours (Steam doesn't register my play time on my Windows Vista computer) it feels like I'm playing a mellow game of chess with ranged pieces.\n\nThis is not billed as a rogue-like, randomized, dungeon crawl.  It is not yet-another-game trying to mimic a popular formula by throwing together some new graphics and ability descriptions but having the exact same gameplay to try and cash in on what people are trending. There are no magic items, equipment, or troop level-up ability trees.  The strategy of the game is to build an army using unit pieces of varying stats and abilities and clear the map of enemy units. Treasure is obtained from defeated troops from either my army or the enemy's (and sometimes just found in the Dungeon mode) and is used to boost the end-of-skirmish score and allows for building up larger armies in subsequent matches.\n\nThis is a straight forward tactical, board-game simulation with some added story flare.\n\nI will say in the matches against the AI the computer's turn is taken instantaneously, so it is a little difficult to see exactly what moves it has made, but I think that was done by design so that you don't have to wait for the computer to move each piece.  Maybe the developers could add an "easy" mode or something where the computer shows what it is doing, but I often find I get really frustrated when a game artificially slows the computer's turn down and I have to wait.  After about three turns of watching the computer do each move I want to yell, "Will you just GO already!"  So the super-fast computer turns don't bother me at all.\n\nI didn't find much difference between a dungeon game and a campaign game other than map types. Although the dungeons seemed to have more treasure to find and the campaigns do have more story to them.  All in all this is a pretty decent strategy game with a fair amount of army customization for trying out different tactics and it's definitely well worth the low low price.","May 21, 2015","true","31.3"," 48 of 55 people (87%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","87","48","55","4","2"

There is no way to turn down the sound/music without doing so on your System Mixer and you're unable to change the resolution for the game... there is only one, which is 640x480. Music is good but has background static and it sometimes randomly shuts off during game play.  Protip for people who actually decide to spend 4 dollars on this game, ESC shuts off the game's sound. Also, archers are ridiculously over powered because they can shoot through anything. Seriously, my archer shot through 4 wall blocks and dealt the same amount of damage your basic infantry man can do. What's the point of using anything other than a group of archers with 1 or 2 scouts? Sounds like you need some balancing there. The menu clicking reverbs if clicked too quickly, consider changing it to something that isn't a bell dinging and echoing.\n\nDon't get me wrong, there are some nice things, the aforementioned music is nice and relaxing and would be great if it had an adjustable sound bar. The art style is nice and graphically for a PC tabletop game, it doesn't look bad or seem lacking in the art deparment... it's just basic things that have become standard in the game industry over the past 2 decades. Hell, the laziest iOS ports have an ingame mute button that is generally denoted by a speaker icon.\n\nJust my two cents.","May 21, 2015","false","1.0"," 62 of 83 people (75%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","75","62","83","15","0"

I played many hours of this game (and its predecessors) when it was first released.\n\nI enjoy the simple, fast, almost chesslike feel of Crossfire:Dungeons. Every unit type is useful and none is ideal for every circumstance, which makes army building a fun exercise. Against the AI, figuring out how few points you can spend and still win (to maximize score) is quite a challenge.\n\nOf the single player campaigns, Dungeon mode is my favorite (I love the rats). Multiplayer is a blast. Nothing quite like both players firing into the fog hoping for a hit, when only a few units are left on the map.\n\nAnyway, this is a really good value for a game that plays fast but not mindlessly at all.

I noticed this game two days ago and couldn't wait until it went live for sale. Been many years that I've wished for a game like this to come around that captures the tabletop aspect of war gaming, or skirmish battles with real looking miniatures and not the typical computerized animated unit art.\n\n[The Game]\n\nI like what I've seen so far and you have to remember this game just came out less than 24 hours ago. There may be a few issues that have some players complaining such as sound or more specifically the lack of sound volume adjustment, but I'm sure that is something that will be addressed in the future. The other issue is fullscreen mode which there currently is none, but... you CAN expand your window 100% of your screen, so you aren't forced to play in a small window as mentioned elsewhere. Also, if you really want to play Full Screen, you can try using Steam's Streaming mode if you have multiple PCs. I did so to test something and noticed that the game was in full screen mode when streaming from my tablet to my laptop PC.\n\nAs for game play. It is exactly as stated on the game's storefront page. An extremely easy to learn single click system. A rules-lite skirmish system with enough meat to keep you interested. I've played the Dungeon mode and Campaign mode and it's been a blast, but if your not old school like me, you may not like the "Lose the mission, lose the game" method. I grew up playing Wizardry and similar cRPGs back in the early 80's when games were very unforgiving so I like this feature. Some may call it "Perma-deth", I call it a good, tough game that will end up more satisfying when you DO finally win a campaign or dungeon delve!\n\nThe music and sound effects are very atmospheric and yes some sort of volume adjustment would be a plus, but it doesn't kill the game because there isn't an adjustment slider currently.\n\nRegarding campaign mode... I like the branching of the missions when you win a battle. Each branch gives you a little story and then you may choose the default army, or custom pick one for yourself before entering the battlefield.\n\nI've tested multiplayer mode and that is simple to start and also a lot of fun. Get a friend together and go head to head. I think you may be able to play co-op, but I haven't tried that mode so I can't comment there.\n\nOverall, I really like this game and hope to see more in the way of future add-ons, DLC, or even a Crossfire II, etc...\n\nI DO recommend this game to those who love fantasy skirmish systems, especially those that are rules-lite and don't require tons of reading in order to learn or master the system. Crossfire: Dungeons is definitely satisfying my itch for a computerized tabletop skirmish game system! Thanks devs! :)\n\n[Support]\n\nOk, I want to talk about the development team's support of their product because I am extremely appreciative of the help I've received so far.\n\nI have some obscure issue on my Win 8.1 Pro gaming laptop (ASUS GV75V), but the game runs fine on my Win 8.1 Surface Pro type tablet by Samsung.\n\nI posted about my issues on the discussion forum so I wont waste time explaining them here, but I DO want to say that the support I received trying to resolve this issue was top notch. The dev was extremely friendly and tried hard to help resolve the issue. While it wasn't fixed immediately, we did chat a bunch and tried everything we could think of. Seeing that this game works flawlessly on my tablet, and no one else seems to have the same issue as me, it could be my laptop. Still, the dev didn't try the "Well... it works fine for us, and on your tablet, so it is obviously something with your laptop. We cant help with that... Good day to you!" You don't know how many times I've seen support teams try to escape with that tactic. I'm an IT professional and even in desktop/application support, less technical or patient techs love to go for that fast exit! Well, not the dev who was assisting me tonight. He tried everything and while we could not figure it out yet. (Yet is the important word, because I'm sure it will be resolved eventually.) I appreciated all the effort and the fact that the dev stated that he wasn't going to let this lie because I should be able to enjoy the game I purchased and not be stuck with the issue I'm having. That sentiment goes a long way with me. I give support two thumbs up for their assistance and look forward to addressing the issue some more after the devs try to figure out what might be the cause of the issue.\n\n[In Closing]\n\nSorry if this is a long winded review, but I wanted to cover all the aspects that have me loving this game. A quick pros and cons list would be...\n\nPros:\n\n1. Excellent concept.\n2. Simple single click interface.\n3. Lots of missions, units and even a random dungeon mode.\n4. Multiplayer mode to go against your friends.\n5. Multiple campaigns with branching story lines or missions.\n\nCons:\n1. No sound/volume adjustment. (Not a big deal to me as it doesn't affect game play).\n2. Ranged units can fire anywhere on the map, even through walls. That should be addressed.\n3. Ranged units don't appear to have a range limit to their attacks. I'm able to fire anywhere on the board with my archer, or crossbowman.\n4. No Fullscreen. (Not a big deal as I can simply maximize the window the game plays in, or use Streaming mode to obtain fullscreen.)\n\nWell, that is all for now. I hope if you like these types of tabletop war games, or small skirmish games that you will give it a try. For less than $4 it definitely IS worth it! I was expecting the price to be above $10 before it was released.","May 21, 2015","true","4.6"," 19 of 23 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","19","23","2","0"

Unfortunately there is no options button and the only way is to press escape disabling all sound and music in the game.\n\nMy second try was to play the game full screen instead of the tiny window, but beside the little window button to enlarge the screen, which makes the graphics absolute disgusting; there is no options button for resolution or screen size either.\n\nOk, let's play a single player map to try out the game. But the only choice I have is to choose one of the four campaigns with absolute generic names like "Dungeon Campaign" without any description or story. I can choose from four campaigns or click on a button with premium campaigns where two of the four campaigns have the same name as the other campaigns in the other menu. Again the very original Dungeon Campaign.\n\nI start the campaign and find the army selection screen. I can build an army consist of six different characters with some different stats. Very generic stats like one can move two blocks, another can move only one block, one can shoot and one can only make melee damage. I can choose from six different factions and all the factions have six different units.\nThe only difference is the name of the faction, the flag and the unit symbols but no story about them either.\n\nI make up my army consist of two archers and two melee units and start the campaign. I have only one mission in the job list and that is the crypt lvl. 1. Fine let's slay some Undead I suppose.\nI click the begin button and the map is generated in the upper left part of the tiny window at about 1/3 of the total window. The map is built with two different textures. I guess one is the wall and one is the floor. No idea what I have to do, How many monsters I encounter and where to place my units. I can place them anywhere on the floor or on the wall, it doesn't seem to matter.\n\nWhen my four units are stationed I click the start turn button and finally I can command my units.\nAs written in the tutorial I use my archers to shoot random places in the fog of war to maybe hit some undead by accident, but I miss.\nI do not start moving my melee units yet because I want to know first what is in the fog of war so I click the end turn button.\n\nNow it's the computers turn. I don't see anything moving on my side of the screen, but one of my melee units seems\nPoisoned and loses four of his total of eight life health points. Where the poison is coming from and why it's a riddle but nothing happened anymore so I think it's my turn again.\n\nI shoot again some random spaces but misses and choose to move my melee units one space away from the riddle poison. Next turn. Again poison. Losing four health. My unit dies.\nWhat is left is some gold remaining from his body and with my other units I do the same again clicking empty spaces on the world map.\n\nThen there is a zombie. 24 health and my three units I have left can make 3 damage a turn.\nI wouldn't take long before my other unit is filled with poison and dies, but with my archers I manage to kill the zombie. Like my own unit who died before the zombie left the same bag of gold remaining and I choose to pick it up.\n\nThen nothing happened anymore and with my archers I keep clicking random spaces on the map until I find another monster, a ghoul I guess. I ghoul without legs I suppose because it's not moving between turns and every turn I can click the same spot, lessening his health till he dies. Won the game.\n\nAll the treasure I found in the map is the same. The endless bag of gold. No artifacts, no items, no weapons no other content is there. The money I can use to make my army bigger.\n\nAll units are resurrect and I have gold to buy another unit. While I click save army in the army selection screen before I started my first mission, clicking the load button to load my army and upgrade it won't work. The only choice I have is to customize my army which deselects every unit in my army. I build a totally new army and start mission two....\n\nWhile the company’s mission is to bring us the best games on the internet, a big ambition, the play through of my first hour in this game was really unpleasant. No options screen, no content, no working save and load button for the army, no treasure to find instead of the gold bag, random generated maps consist of some random placed blocks of walls and floor textures without any meaning or proper placement and the looping music tune was sounded like it was recorded with a old cassette player with some stormy weather in the background.\n\nEven for the 3 bucks I spend for this I really cannot find anything pleasant in this game. The only pleasant thing is to know that when I install the free version of Gogo's Gamemaker software and produce something like this Steam will allow me to sell this to her customers without any shame.\n\nBTW - English is not my native language and I excuse for my spelling and grammar, but if you are a dev and you have a website for promoting your game it's really unprofessional to start your product page by telling the world you want to "deveolpoing" the best games in the world. Maybe use the spel checker and correct this.\n\nDon't lose your ambition by reading my very negative review. Your ideas are great. The execution is somewhat not worth the 3 bucks I spend and the game in this state is worth no more than a free offer on a 1998 free demo cd-rom from a game magazine.\n\n","May 21, 2015","false","0.3"," 21 of 32 people (66%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","66","21","32","2","1"

There's the basis of a really good turn-based game here. I liked the look of it  and, like another reviewer has said, it reminded me of table-top games I played many years ago with little lead figures and some dice. The battles are fun for a while, but the campaigns lack any depth and are just repititions of the same battles over and over. It could be improved by adding some more variety in the battle environments, additional unit types, slowing down the AI so you can see what moves it has taken, and by enabling a pass-and-play mode (as I don't know if anyone is playing this online). If the battles could be incorporated into some sort of RPG that would make a great game (something akin to Might and Magic etc). Ultimately it lacks longevity, but as I only paid 33 pence for it and it has provided cheap entertainment for a couple of hours, I have to give it a thumbs-up.","April 24","true","2.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

But there's NO way to save your progress, and the auto-save doesn't work. In short, you have to start over from scratch each time you load the game. The vague assurances that a fix is forthcoming aren't helpful. It's been almost a year since the last update, and the game is still broken.\n\nNOT RECOMMENDED.","March 20","false","1.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"
