Necrovision: Lost Company is the same thing, except it's late to the party and the joke hangs in the air like a wet fart in a sauna.\n\nIt's buggy- really buggy. Animations, sounds, the fact that your American escort will spontaneously start shouting in German as soon as he starts shooting at things, it's all there.\nNew from the original, you spend probably 80% of the game running around with at least one invulnerable mook to watch your back; good or bad, the interpretation is up to you.\nY'get a flare gun and a flamethrower machine gun as your new weapons- the former is useless, the latter can mop up everything with just a tuft of liquid conflagration.\nThere's a tank level and an airplane level. Considering the previous one had a mother-loving dragon level, I'm not particularly impressed.\n\nTo put it simply- if you played Necrovision, don't play Lost Company unless you really enjoy the flaws of the series and you're willing to put another eight hours of your life through them. All the ham, grit, hilarity, and horror of the first are replaced with recycled or vacant memories of either, and there's only enough exposition to barely fill the gaps in the previous one without enhancing it at all.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go hate myself a little bit for ragequitting the final boss on the highest difficulty. I like a challenge almost to the point of masochism, but I'd have more fun drinking my own tears than gargling that can of nails.","November 22, 2014","false","1.5"," 20 of 31 people (65%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","65","20","31","10","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198008373031/recommended/46250/","76561198008373031","Probotector®","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198008373031/","219 products in account","Necrovision: Lost Company isn't a well-crafted game. It's flawed, riddled with annoying bugs and weirdly implemented gameplay systems and yet I enjoyed its 6 hour long campaign (Steam didn't keep track of my whole playtime). It feels like a B-movie and has its own charme.\n\nYou are playing as Jonas Zimmermann, a German scientist who is apparently really old (as NPC often mock him because of his age), trying to get to Fort Stern to find a cure for the undead who are roaming through the battlefields of WW1. Oh and vampires or something... the story has no depth at all and that's not what I expected of Lost Company to begin with. You can find letters of fallen soldiers along the way. For some reason, the narrations of these letters will continue to play even after putting them away, which is quite annoying. The voice acting is terrible but fits the game perfectly, I adore the silly battlecrys of the undead and NPCs in particular.\n\nNecrovision: Lost Company is running on the Pain Engine and it shows. The game runs fine but the graphics are quite ugly. The original Painkiller from 2004 manages to look considerably better than this game. Body models look blocky and lifeless, texture quality ranges from barely acceptable to crap and animations look really unnatural, which on the other hand benefits the enemies. I really like their designs, especially those barb-wired zombies running on stumps, creepy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. Sound design is decent at best. You can understand what everyone is saying and the weapons sound powerful. The soundtrack is very well composed and some tracks stuck with me for a while.\n\nThe game features elements from modern shooters (such as regenerating health) but plays more like Serious Sam or Painkiller, albeit with a slower pace than those. Gunplay feels satisfying for the most part but the way weapons are handled in this game is mind boggling. You see, Zimmermann acquires an absurdely large arsenal of firearms on his way to Fort Stern and some of these are simply not needed. Why am I carrying a BAR when I already have a MP that is just as useful? Why do I need to carry 3-4 Gewehr 98 rifles (standard, grenade launcher, scope, bayonet) when I could simply have one with all these attachments? Why have a normal MG and the same one with a flamethrower? It makes switching weapons really cumbersome. Same with melee weapons. I maybe used 2 or 3 grenades during my playthrough because switching to them is unintuitive. Necrovision: Lost Company is a fairly easy game on normal difficulty since your character tanks through damage like a champ. It isn't necessarily a bad thing since you're not forced to take cover, thus keeping the pace up. You can also level up your "Fury" level, either by finding secret vampire artifcats or performing combos on enemies. I only found it useful when using the MP, since headshots would make me perform reloads much quicker and it would also stun enemies nearby.\n\nDespite all the issues I had with the game, it was worth the purchase. I suggest picking Necrovision: Lost Company up when it goes on sale.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNecrovision: Lost Company ist kein Meisterwerk. Während meines Playthroughs bin ich auf zahlreiche Bugs gestossen und musste mich mit einigen fragwürdingen Gameplayelementen rumschlagen und dennoch habe ich die 6-stündige Kampagne genossen (Meine Spielzeit laut Steam stimmt nicht). Es fühlt sich wie ein B-Movie an und versprüht seinen ganz eigenen Charme.\n\nMan schlüpft in die Rolle von Jonas Zimmermann, einem deutschen Wissenschaftler der schon einige Jahre auf dem Buckel hat (wodurch er öfters von NPCs auf die Schippe genommen wird) und sich zum Fort Stern aufmacht um ein Heilmittel für die Untoten zu finden, die die Schlachtfelder des 1. Weltkrieges unsicher machen. Oh, und noch etwas mit Vampiren oder so... die Geschichte besitzt keinerlei Tiefgang, habe dies aber von Lost Company nicht erwartet. In den Levels ist es möglich, Briefe von gefallenen Soldaten zu lesen. Allerdings hört die Vertonung dieser nicht auf, sobald man die Briefe weglegt, was zeimlich nervig ist. Das Voiceacting ist eine Katastrophe aber passt zum Spiel. Besonders gut gefallen mir die unsinnigen Kampfrufe der Untoten und NPCs.\n\nNecrovision: Lost Company läuft auf der Pain Engine und das zeigt sich bemerkbar. Das Spiel läuft zwar flüssig, sieht aber sogar im Vergleich mit Painkiller aus dem Jahre 2004 schlechter aus. Körpermodellen sehen blockig und leblos aus, Texturqualität pendelt zwischen gerade noch akzeptabel bishin zu Augenkrebs und Animationen sehen sehr unnaturell aus, was aber den gegnern zu Gute kommt. Ich mag deren Designs, mein Favorit ist der von Stacheldraht umwobene Zombie, welcher einem  auf blutigen Stummeln zurennt. Gruselig, der ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\nSounddesign geht in Ordnung, Gespräche sind gut hörbar und die Waffen klingen gewaltig. Der Soundtrack gefällt mir sehr gut und einige der Titel blieben mir noch lange nach Beenden des Spieles im Gedächtnis.\n\nAuch wenn das Spiel sich im ersten Blick eher auf die Spielprinzipien von modernen FPS aufbaut (z.B. Healthregeneration) spielt es sich eher wie ein langsameres Serious Sam oder Painkiller. Das Gunplay fühlt sich meistens sehr gut an, jedoch kann ich nicht nachvollziehen, warum das Waffensystem in diesem Spiel so schlecht ist. Während seines Trips nach For Stern eignet sich Zimmermann ein absurd riesiges Arsenal an Feuerwaffen an und einige dieser Feuerwaffen werden nicht gebraucht. Warum trage ich eine BAR mit mir rum, wenn ich schon eine MP habe, die genauso gut ist? Warum besitze ich 3 bis 4 unterschiedliche Gewehr 98 (ohne Ausatz, Granatenwerfer, Zielfernrohr, Bajonett) wenn eines mit allen Aufsätzen ausreichen würde? Warum ein normales MG mitschleppen, wenn sich dasselbe mit einem Flammenwerferaufsatz in meinem Waffeninventar wiederfindet? Das Auswählen der für die Situation erforderlichen Waffe verkommt zu einem Geduldsspiel. Dasselbe Problem findet man bei den Nahkampfwaffen. Ich habe während meines Playthroughs höchstens 2 bis 3 Granaten benutzt, weil das Wechseln zu diesen nicht intuitiv ist. Necrovision: Lost Company ist ein relativ leichtes Spiel auf normaler Schwierigkeitsstufe, da der Hauptcharakter einiges an Schaden wegstecken kann. Dies ist nicht unbedingt was Schlechtes, da man dadurch nicht gezwungen wird, hinter Schutzwallen zu verharren, was dem Spielfluss zu Gute kommt. Letzendlich kann man auch seinen "Wut"-Level erhöhen, in dem man Vampirartifakte findet oder Combos an Gegnern ausführt. Genützt hat es mir nur im Zusammenspiel mit der MP, da Kopfschüsse mich mit einem schnelleren Magazinwechseln belohnt haben und nahestehende Gegner betäubt wurden.\n\nTrotz den Problemen, die ich mit dem Spiel hatte, hat sich der Kauf gelohnt. Ich empfehle euch, das Spiel bei einem Sale zu holen.","January 19, 2015","true","3.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","1"

Tem seus bugs, mas qual jogo não tem? Só que usa muita coisa do outro  revisitando alguns mapas do anterior - o que é legal - e usando as mesmas músicas também - o que não achei legal.\nAs novas armas são legais também como a pistolinha sinalizadora e metralhadora mais potente. É mais curto que o outro. Assim como o primeiro tem partes de simulação de transporte como a fase de pilotar o teco-teco e dirigir o tanque. Chefes e inimigos legais também, como o lobisomem e a enfermeira. E a história é interessante porque a gente joga com o cientista que ao decorrer do jogo vai ficando cada vez mais maléfico depois de absorver o poder da semente do mal. E isso explica a árdua batalha que tivemos contra ele no anterior - Adiciona algumas coisinhas de novidade e mantém o bom resto com o mesmo ritmo, e algumas vezes até melhor que o antecessor. Resumindo gostei bastante, e pareceu ser menos bugado que o outro, porém menor - se bem que o outro enche linguiça demais.","May 14, 2014","true","13.1"," 4 of 14 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","4","14","0","0"

During the playthrough, we will visit familiar places from the original game, as well as new places, and find out why Zimmerman has gone so evil.\nThe add-on introduces some new weapons, which include a german machine-gun with a flamethrower. Brutal.\n\nOverall, Lost Company is a worthy add-on, and, if you liked the original, this one won't leave you indifferent.","November 1, 2015","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm going to recomend this game, becuse the gameplay is pretty funny, and it doesn't get boring doing the time you play it.
