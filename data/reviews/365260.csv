The water effects are my favorite part in all honesty, the rest is simply "there".  If you're looking for an in-depth submarine simulator, this is not it.  If you're just looking to spend a few minutes torpedoing ships out of the water, then give this a look.  I'm giving it a positive recommend because it's very similar to "SS2" and it's more convenient to play this than to bring my NES out of mothballs.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hVkMGLHKSM\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8oNsuz_jl4","July 6, 2015","true","1.6"," 84 of 96 people (88%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","88","84","96","5","1"

Shockingly... I don't hate it. In fact, it's pretty damn entertaining for short stretches. It's not a sim by any means, but it doesn't really pretend to be either. It's a bit like Aces of the Deep, which, when it came out (10 billion years ago), felt like a Sim because of the immersion factor, but deep down had mechanics that were not far from Crash Dive's. I feel like the devs left out a lot of immersion to save on costs and also probably from Political Correctness concerns, but that's really not a huge deal in the end. If you want to play Aces it runs fine under dosbox if you find the right version, but this gives you fairly similar gameplay with passable graphics and a laser focus on quickly resolving encounters so you can go do something else without giving the whole thing too much thought. It's bite size, and it's good. Get it if you like WWII sub stuff.","July 6, 2015","true","54.2"," 55 of 60 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","55","60","2","5"

Nice water effects and it is fun sinking ships with torpedos or the deck gun (although pretty simple), diving to deploy decoys, and making an escape.  You can't see underwater, it goes into the map view, but this view is nice since it has ship models moving around and looks good with various info.  Seems like it has good replayability and is a nice way to burn 20 or 30 minutes at a time. You can pick up patrols where you left off.  Worth it IMO.","July 7, 2015","true","2.3"," 19 of 19 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","19","19","0","0"

For example, I was right next to a sinking an ocean liner (troop transport)  and the sub rolled in the waves, up and down, Plus, originally  I thought the water effects were'nt all that great but when I actually observed the water (Chesapeake Bay for me) I realized how realistic they were.\n\nAlso, this game is a good value for it's price - one of the reasons I surf Steam to find gems like this. So it's not super-strategic - it isn't meant to be. But it's a good way to kill time for an hour or less (or more) - when you don't want to get involved at the moment with a heavy strategic game. Plus it's easy to learn and hard to master, as the aphorism goes.\n\nClearly an under-appreciated gem in my opinion. (And FYI I play with a mouse on an i7 so results of course may vary).\n\n","August 14, 2015","true","28.2"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

The last 2 achievements I have are 500 and 1 million km sailed .Im at 139 thousand.So at that rate I would have to play over 200 hours more just to grind out the last achievements just sailing around . Thats the only draw back I can say about the game as me being a gamer always trying to get 100%.This is reallly unreasonable to do or have to do. The game does allow 2 x or 4x or 8x or 16x the action speed up to quicken the game and I used this skill alot and got  pretty good at the speed up game play to finish battles off faster. Over all good game for price but the sailing around is going to be a real grind if your looking to complete this game 100% .","April 20","true","32.4"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","11","11","0","2"

It's not a hard-core sub sim like Silent Hunter but its not all arcade lite either. It has a "sim" difficulty level that is pretty challenging. On its easiest level its a fun game to just kick back and enjoy sinking ships. On Sim difficulty sinking a heavily guarded target and evading the escorts gives a deep feeling of satisfaction.\n\nPros:\ngood graphics\nwide range of difficulty levels\nreal world sub tactics give best results (just like in a hard core sub sim)\nprice\nrandom mission generator and campaign\n\nCons:\nBing a tablet/phone port the UI is not the best for a PC. Could use some hotkeys. Right now its all mouse\ncould use more camera views (torpedo cam, free cam, underwater cam)\n\nOverall, I can strongly recommend this game. Would love to see a Crash Dive 2 designed for PC from the ground up.","August 15, 2015","true","11.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Very short learning curve.  It's a coast to play on easy but that's the level to practice your gunnery so you have a chance on the high level.  Once you have the basics down medium level can give you a good challange.  High level is just difficult enough to make me want to master it.

The game mechanics are great and this is probably the best mobile port yet! I have enjoyed this game a lot in the time I played it but without much of a progression or upgrade system I am not really interested. Surely a lot of people can get joy out of doing the same with varying difficulty but I require some depth to the gameplay. It brings back good Silent Hunter memories and makes me miss any progression even more.\n\nTo sum it up: It is a simplistic take on Silent Hunter which is suprisingly well made! Good job devs! You did a really good job developing and porting this game.\n\nI am going to refund though because I just dont see any long term motivation in playing a pretty shallow but good game.\nThis is solely because of my personal preference so if you'd like to play a game that is easy to get and unwind on buy it!","May 23","false","0.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
