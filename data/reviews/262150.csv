That and the publisher never explained how they got the rights to sell it.\n\n2 - The characters they're selling as DLC have always been in the original game.\n\n3 - Not all DLC characters work together which is ridiculous, just look at what I wrote on top of this. All these characters were on the original game to begin with, how come they won't work together now?\n\n4 - The gameplay is  dull, clunky and awkward. You don't need to go for combos at all, you can just break the AI by spamming any kind of attack when they perform a wake up.\n\n5 - The game gets boring really fast. REALLY. FAST.\n\nDON'T. BUY.

It is time for a review.\nI personally love this game. Saki is my favorite character. Do I recommend this game? Yes, but under certain circumstances. First, let's dive into the true pros and cons of this game. [READ EVERYTHING, INCLUDING MULTIPLAYER]\n\nPros:\n+ Decent fighting system\n+ The game runs perfectly fine (Even with WINE)\n+ I got it for $1.50 or something like that on Amazon\n+ Animations are great\n+ Voice acting is good\n+ Very fast pace\n+Works 90% with Xbox 360 controller (Even through WINE[Still no D-Pad support])\n\nTo the cons:\n-Little to no story\n-Full screen is stretched if you have a widescreen monitor\n-Full screen is just default window size and blurry\n-Characters such as Lilith keep on spamming a move that will take down your health crazily. (Example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=immWpTWSCuM )\n-The game does not tell you the commands for the support. (It tells you that Y [Xbox Controller] is the way to activate support, but to actually use them properly. It requires you to move the joy stick in certain directions.\n\nConclusion: I will recommend this game because it is definitely fun. Of course it's not the absolute best fighting game out there, but for $1.50 or ($5.00 on steam) it's not really that bad. In fact it's fun to play. Other review say that it's only good for about two or so hours of gameplay, but if you give yourself challenges such as beating the game on all difficulties, then you will get the most or even more out of your purchase. For those who may understand, this is basically Marvel VS Capcom (the original), but with an anime/Japanese art style.\n\nI didn't include this in the review, but I think people should know about it. You can play multiplayer with Vanguard Princess. I'm not talking about local, I'm talking about online.\nIf you want to play multiplayer with a friend, (because I could not for the life of me find any servers) then follow this post:\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/app/262150/discussions/0/540744935955723372/?insideModal=1\nNow, this explains MOST of what you need to do. But if you want to host your own server for your friends to join, you MUST..\n*_ Open port 7500 to TCP and UDP\n*_ Now that the port is open, open up MTSP\n* In order to host a server for you and your friends, you must get your public IP here: http://www.whatismyip.com/ (Your IP is: ###.###.###.### <-- that long number)\n* Once you have copied that number, go back to MTSP\n* The Startup window should still be open, click the tab named "Encrypt IP"\n* Paste your IP into the Unencrypted IP box and press the button "Encrypt"\n* The box below it should have a whole bunch of numbers now\n* You need to copy those numbers and go back to the "Select Mode" tab\n* If you are making the server for your friends, make sure the current mode is "Server"\n* Paste the number you got into the "Server Name" box and press okay [MAKE SURE IT IS STILL ON PORT 7500]\n* Now your server is made and your friends can join\n_For your friends, they follow the SteamCommunity post, then open port 7500. (I don't have to do TCP and UDP, but have them do it just to be safe)\n_Once they open MTSP , they should have that same Startup box\n_They need to click on "Client"\n_Then they need to put the number the host recieved got earlier (The encrypted thing) into the "Destination IP" box\n_[Make sure DNS is off, unless you know what you're doing] and then press OK\n_This should result in joining the server. Right click someones name to the left and press challenge to fight them.\nYou should be set up now for Online vanguard princess. The reason I'm putting this here is because I had to find that community post, and then go through an ancient MTSP post on a Japanese website in order for it to work. (Because the servers are empty and may cause a high ping)\nHope this was helpful!","November 28, 2014","true","26.7"," 172 of 202 people (85%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","85","172","202","6","5"

The only way to play/move the characters is using the analog stick or the keyboard, and I dislike using either for a fighting game. Changing the buttons used for up/down and left/right is not possible.\nI hope, that they'll fix this, because, to be honest, I have enjoyed playing the bit that I have played. I'm not going to give the game a negative recommendation because of this problem either, because it's a personal preference.","March 3, 2014","true","1.1"," 213 of 289 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","213","289","0","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/duvel1337/recommended/262150/","duvel1337","duvel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/duvel1337/","318 products in account","So right off the bat I have to point out one important thing: this was originally a freeware game that has apparently had a few bugfixes? and localization. Not much has changed from the original state besides the addition of English for the very ignorable plot.\n\nKnowing that, it's much more ridiculous how bad a deal this is technically. Nothing has changed from the freeware state, which raises the question of why should you pay for it.\n\nThe game doesn't have selectable resolutions so good luck keeping aspect ratio as you pull the window larger. The original resolution is very tiny as a result of using an extremely old and dated engine, Fighter Maker 2k. On top of that, it doesn't recognize my arcade stick's directional inputs. I suspect it won't register the POV hat as directions, and there's no way to change it. I resorted to Joy2Key; good job, game I paid money for.\n\nOnce you get the game running how you want it, there's no training mode to mess around with. You've got "Story" (arcade mode) and versus modes and that's it. There's no sort of tutorial and the manual is a mess. The manual constantly refers to buttons as ABXY instead of something more easily parsed like ABCD, which took some getting used to just to read it.\n\nAfter jumping into the arcade mode and skipping past most of the translated text because it was immediately noninteresting, I messed around in the actual game itself, and wasn't really impressed there. The attacks are a simple Light, Medium, and Heavy system with an extra button for your assist character, who you also pick at the character select screen. This was a neat idea, but I didn't like the way it felt because the assist character moves around at a sort of lag compared to your character. On top of that, the assist characters are little girls not that much shorter than the other girls you play, so on screen it gets kinda busy and hard to read the situation. The UI in general is underwhelming. The biggest flaw is in the super and assist meters. You require meter in your assist meter to do anything with the assist attacks, but the meter is so small at the bottom of the screen that you have to strain yourself to read it.\n\nIt's very clear a lot of work went into animating the game, and the animation is very fluid as a result. Unfortunately the designs leave a lot to be desired, as most are generic anime shlock, with a more adult oriented costume theme (man that final boss was silly looking). The assist characters are all little girls, and the regular characters are plucked from anime stereotypes. Uninspiring and unrelatable, and also not very good for the image of women in video games.\n\nOverall the technical issues on top of the poor UI design and bad choices for sprite design with the assist characters make the game more of a headache to bother with. I played through with one character and I was done. If you want titilation go watch porn. If you want an anime fighting game and don't care about netplay BlazBlue Calamity Trigger just got released on Steam and has actual UI design and works with controllers.","March 3, 2014","false","1.8"," 797 of 1,170 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","797","1","0","32"

The style and art is great, the gameplay is simple, and is the perfect thing to play when you want someting casual. If your a game collector, get this.

Originally, a freeware game, this game remained very similar to  the freeware version. First off, there is a compatibility issue with Windows 8. Any system with Windows 8 or newer cannot launch the game in full screen mode without the resolution messing up. Adjusting the settings and Windows compatibility mode does not resolve the problem.\n\nIn addition, the story for this game has no plot devices.

Catchy music, great sprite art and one of the best displays of pixel animation I've seen, this is actually some pretty quality stuff. Once you actually play with another person who knows the game, it's very absurd, yet very fun and easy to learn. whether your on a  fightstick, keyboard, or controllers none of the inputs are overwhelming and can be mastered with abit of practice.\n\nWhile the game itself is simple, there is not much in terms of content as it is a doujin-soft that was orginally freeware. It's still nice to see doujin soft appear on the steam market.\nThere was a netcode patch for the freeware version, but if it gets patched into this version that would be great. (They did note that they will be updating this game, so there is hope)\n\nThis current version of the game seems to be slighty different from 1.08, and the port itself was made from the permission of Suge9 for the 2011 Japan Earthquake for fundraising at anime expos. While its not the best, it was done with good intent and what needs to be there is there. As in what the revenue is going towards, we don't know possibly more work done on the game.\n\nThe cast consits of all kinds of fighting game playstyles from: Eri the rekka, Luna the stance switcher, to even a loli that is the grappler. All of which have glorified panty-flashes(lol).\n\nPIXELMOE(7.5)/10, the price of the game makes sense, even with a local-only play it's still great cheap fighting fun. Hell if your really cheap you can just download the free version. Google it, it will pop up instantly. If you are playing with another person its 8.5/10 levels of fun.

I have found it to be both noisy and brightly colored. It will occasionally react to keyboard input, although it is crucially missing the "Just dispense the tradng cards already" button. Rumor has it that that will be in the next DLC.\n\nIn combat, you must choose the direction of attack and movement (presumably combined because moving in one direction and attacking in the other would weaken the dimensional infrastructure), and the type of attack (Weak, Normal, Strong). My personal favorite is "Weak" - because really, why bother with an attack unless it's a really weak one.\n\nCharacter selection screen needs some work, as you can't get a really good feel for the interpersonal relationships between the primary fighter and her assistant or cosmetologist or whatever the second girl is supposed to be for. I mean sure, Kaede can use "Godspeed Bloodbath" (actual in-game move name, BTW), but is Hilda really down with that? She really strikes me more as a "heavy on the bloodbath part, ease off on the Godspeed", so you know, maybe some ideological differences down the road there.\n\nI would recommend this to anyone who enjoys pressing the attack key quite often. Also if you feel that the current crop of games have too many pants-wearing characters. Because they don't have that in this game. Overall, a good design choice, as the money that could have been spent on pants went instead to some stellar voice acting talent. When they grunt with exertion or make a surprised exclamation, it's like you are actually there. More to the point, it's like real life because there are no apparent audio controls.\n\nFinally as a service to those who were looking a "how anime is it"? breakdown: It is slightly more chibi than Skyrim, somewhere between Farming SImulator and Payday 2 in kawaii and moe, and more loli and  ecchi than DOTA.\n\nBottom line: If you DO like anime and DON'T like pants, you'll like this game.","March 3, 2014","true","1.9"," 31 of 47 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","31","47","0","2"

How can I play Planetside 2 but not even get the menu of a 2D fighting game to run smoothly? And I'm not talking about some mediocre 15 FPS or anything. I mean that there is no visible refreshing in the game - I hear the music playing but the screen displays about ~0.005 frames per second. The blinking of the indicator would probably take 15 minutes. I thought full screen might solve that problem. I was terribly mistaken. Sure, full screen DID solve the framerate. But the game itself remained the same size and resolution on my screen, with a giant black screen filling out the rest. Furthermore, the graphics were replaced by 50 shades of purple. Entirely unplayable. And as far as I could tell, the fighting lacks any sort of depth and the roster is bleak at best. Pantsu or pantsu? Your choice!\n\nTL;DR:\n\nNot a real fighting game, get King of Fighters instead. Ten bucks more but infinitely better. Also not a game made with weeaboo virgins as their specific demographic.\n\nEDIT:\n\nLook through the comments. Most people who recommend this game are either trolls who are doing it for the lulz, or weeaboo virgins. if you're either of those, buy the game and recommend it. If you're sane and prefer not to waste time and money, buy something else. Buy some matches and light your face on fire for example.

There will be times where your character just stands there, and all you can do are basic attacks while standing.

Cf this hell girl with the 360 + x + B. That doesn't work, weirdly enough it's with LB... and I don't ♥♥♥♥ing know why the LB button makes me attack in red instead of the immobile guard either because there isn't any ♥♥♥♥ing tutorial !)\n\nAnyway so the "button tutorial" show you absolutely nothing of value, neither does the command list.\n\nAnd then comes the difficulty, so you... try on easy let's say, and you beat the ennemies because you kinda found out maybe how to launch an ultimate, not sure though.. Still you're not sure on how you make your ally attack more than the 1 cost attack that doesn't do ♥♥♥♥, but you can't know how because there isn't any ♥♥♥♥ing tutorial... But you do arrive at the last stage...\n\nAnd here comes Hilde (I think)... And then, you get zoned until there is no tomorrow. Playing the submission move character (the hell girl from before) I have a special that makes me spit fire (close range) and two dash + submission move (one being a jump dash)... And Hilde spams red beams and falling swords and what not, making it IMPOSSIBLE to get close. Let's not even talk about launching my ultimate that has to be as close as can be of the opponent.\n\nSo... When you have no zoning, and no way to move close to the ennemy that spams zoning because the easy mode knows how to play 200 times more than you and abuses the system, what do you do...? Well you die, you find a character that can zone, even take hilde, and then spam through all the modes of difficulty these same attacks.\n\nAnyway, difficulty is broken, no tutorial whatsoever makes it very unfriendly for a novice / intermediate player, and the button prompts aren't even correct.\n\nA shame really.","July 30, 2015","false","0.3"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","9","12","3","0"

Ehhh?\nI don't really play fighting games apart from Tekken so I wouldn't really be a good judge on how it is as a fighting game itself but theres a long list of problems that just bug me.\n-Characters seem unbalanced: Some can do special throws that take away half of your health yet they don't count as a SPECIAL move so it doesn't behave as a special attack so it can be done repeatedly. Some characters have ranged weapons which they can spam. All in all the characters aren't bad but you can get some unfair matches that you really don't have any way of winning\n-Supports don't do much: From what I've expirenced your loli supports don't really do a whole lot? Some seem really ♥♥♥♥ in terms of moves. You probably won't get a chance to use them much anyway seeing as how you get penelized from getting hit some certain way? I don't understand it. Also it seems you can't counter with the supports, it seems your support won't do damage if the opponent is just recovering from a hit or hitting or just preformed a hit. It's odd.\n\nAll together as a game I'd rank it a 6/10 but as a fighting game it's more of a 3/10.

Tried to get the game to recognize all three of my xbox controllers. The game does not recognize them. The only one it recognized slightly was the logitech that switches from xbox to playstation. The game recognized the playstation controller, but was barely functional. Here is an example of how the game's setup is completely off-putting from the start.\n\nhttp://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/355021990278974652/C47174E494060402441D7B323A7BD7D5C0E79377/\n\nI still do not recommend this game. It's hard for me to give a bad review ever. I typically won't say anything if I think something bad about a game. But I just want to give a warning to people out there.

Impeccable sprite work, cute girls, lots of panty shots if that’s your thing but it also has its fair share of issues:\n\nThe game runs in a meager 640x480 resolution and it ruins the gorgeous sprites. You can resize the screen but the end results won’t be pretty and not much can be done about it since the original sprites were made with that res in mind. The gameplay while decent felt a bit lackluster. I would like to mention that I’m not a fighter buff so my opinion might not be the most accurate.\n\nIf you are still on the edge you can download the original version for free from the creator website.\n\nEspañol:  Es un juego anime de lucha realizado totalmente por una sola persona y puedo decir que hizo un trabajo asombroso. Los sprites son hermosos, la música decente y el elenco de personajes carismático más no todo podía ser color rosa...\n\nAl abrir el juego nos recibirá una triste resolución de 640x480 que no permite apreciar la calidad de los sprites en todo su esplendor, la ventana es expandible pero desafortunadamente no le sientan muy bien. El combate entreteniene durante un par de horas pero no es nada del otro mundo, agregar que no soy muy ducho en el tema ni un entusiasta por lo que mi opinión puede no ser del todo acertada.\n\nEn resumen, buena forma de matar algunas horas. Si por alguna razón quieres darle un vistazo sin hacer la inversión tienes la opción de descargar el proyecto original totalmente gratis en la página oficial del creador.","November 24, 2015","true","4.2"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

Anyone who likes anime and fighting games, this is a must have for what its worth! Tomoaki Sugeno is a fighting game god in his own right, for doing this whole game ALONE, selecting music and sound effects he could afford, voice acttresses out of his own pocket and still coming up with a game that is alot better then much of the crap the larger companies put out costing millions and millions to make. I wish other games like this would come to steam, personally I would pay anything for some of the Nitro+ games, specially Nitro Royale which is my favorite fighting game up there with any SNK or Arc System Works game. It doesnt have much in terms of detph, the roster is limited, but the music and sound are great, the controls are tight and responsive and I love how the animation is fluid and built around the game. The only set back is the resolution is limited since it was done on the Fighter Maker 2nd, and so when you play full screen will have to fiddle with the screen or just play windowed. You might be able to still get the japanese version free I think or the censored english version elsewhere, but its nice to have it on steam, in english and with the original content.","March 3, 2014","true","2.1"," 16 of 28 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","16","28","0","2"

The controls for keyboard are very badly designed (TFGH wtf?), and on top of all this there is no obvious back or exit button; Instead you have to clse the entire game. The story is about a girl who somehow miraculously survived an airplane crash and then somehow grew up to become a "beautiful woman," with no explantion on how she got out of the terrible situation she was in. She then gains magic powers and the government now wants to exploit these powers.

There is an option to play local multiplayer (again, controllers recommended), and you can alternate between versus and practice mode (infinite health) at will; however, time will still tick down to 0.\n\nThe game and AI can be fairly challenging (the boss is very difficult if you do not know your combos and button mash), however, the learning curve is reasonable if you are used to fighting games and/or persist through the game.\n\nThere are support characters, and you have a gauge for your special attacks and support options. You can use your support characters to harass your enemy or even inflict brutal combos on them.\n\nThe combat is very fleshed out despite having a limited skill/combo list for each character (you can still string together many cool-looking combinations). There is a fun parry mechanic that allows you to ignore attacks and counterattacck or retreat. One of the best feelings in the game is successfully parrying an oppent's special (like the Street Fighter tournament where one person successfully advance-guarded Chun-Li's combo special to take no damage, if you've seen the video).\n\nAlthough the character selection is small, each character is very unique in their skill sets and specialties. For example, there is a fighter who excels in grappling, and another who wields guns and can chain together devastating long/short-ranged combos (she starts with a fixed number of bullets, and must reload once she runs out - leaving herself temporarily vulnerable).\n\nI would definitely recommend this game for people into fighters and/or anime.","July 12, 2014","true","3.3"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

You've brought a paltry offering\nof chicken soup as rain patters down lightly\noutside your house. Summer-Rain smiles\nweakly as she sits up, looking at you.\n\n"Starboy." She mumbles, rubbing the sleep\nfrom her eyes and yawning, before holding\nher jaw in annoyance. Your hand finds its way\nthere and you try to soothe her pain. "Oww..."\nshe welps, her injuries from Prelude still a\ndiscomfort to her.\n\n"Don't move much..." You start, as she looks\nat you with a mixture of irritation and pain.\n"Come on. Soup's here." Summer-Rain pouts.\n"It's been close to two weeks I've been resting,\nand we even missed New Year's! I wanna do\nsomething, Starboy!" She yells, before her\njaw stops her with pain. "I know... I know...\nMaybe we could play a fighting game?"\n\n"Ok...! After soup then!" Summer-Rain nods,\nclapping her oversized pyjama sleeves and\nhands together.\n\nAFTER SOUP\n\nYou boot up Steam and look through your\n'FIGHTING' section of games, when she\norders you to stop and points to a game\ncalled 'Vanguard Princess'. Summer-Rain\nholds her hands on her hips, her face says\nthat she demands an explanation.\n\n"Look, I was in a rough place in the first two\nweeks Ms. Novocaine left. Of course I bought\na game like that!" You sputter as Summer-Rain\nrolls her eyes. Smiling, she shrugs and takes\nup a second controller while you reach for\nyour own. Vanguard Princess boots up and\nboth of you are taken to the menu screen.\n\nThe game has a decent selection of both\nlady fighters and their chibi partners, which\ncan be mixed-and-matched before any given\nmatch. Optional color palette swaps are\navailable as you both thumb through them.\nSummer-Rain looks at you for a while before\nspeaking, as she selects 'Saki' who looks like\nherself, but comments on your choice of the\nVanguard Princess 'Kaede'.\n\n"Why did you pick her?" Summer-Rain asks,\nwhile the screen blinks the loading screen\nmomentarily before the match loads. Puzzled,\nyou ask what does she mean. Summer-Rain\nexplains that you could have picked any one\nof the Princesses, even a mirror-match-up\nbetween two Sakis would have been nice,\nbut the fact you picked Kaede... who has\nmore than a suspicious resemblance to the\nevil Ms. Novocaine... says something about\nyou.\n\n"Are you... implying something, Summer?"\nYou start, as both of you begin to fight\nagainst the backdrop of an unassuming\nHigh school. "Yes... what if I am, Starboy?"\nShe says coldly, her eyes looking glazed\nover as she uses Saki's sword attacks. You\ncan barely hold up with Kaede's own\ncounterattacks and realize that she might\nhave a point... Kaede does look like how\nMs. Novocaine was when you were with\nher.\n\n"This entire game makes no sense." You\nsuddenly hear Summer-Rain candidly say,\nas both of you return to the menu screen\nafter Summer-Rain wins the match-up.\n"How do you mean?" You ask, as your\ntired girlfriend rolls her eyes. "The story\nis laughable, but in a good kind of way.\nThe game is so short, even with all the\ndifferent match-ups, and although each\nof the characters have their own\nmotivations, let's be honest..."\n\n"???" You tilt your head to the side.\n\n"This whole game is just an excuse to\nsee hot near-nude women go at each\nother and occassionally glimpsing\nupskirt and pantyshots. Right?" She\nputs down the controller and gives\nyou a quizzical, 'I told you so' look.\n\n"....right." You reply, thinking better\nnot to explain yourself when she gets up\nand pushes her controller to you. You\ninstinctively hold it as she walks past you,\nwhere you feel an indescribable sadness\nradiate from Summer-Rain. You call out\nto her as she makes her way to the door.\n\n"...Summer...?" She turns to you, eyes\nglistening and a look of sadness is her\nresponse to you. "You... still think of her,\ndon't you?" she asks, her voice trembling.\n\nYour mouth parts in shock of what she\nsaid, what she accuses you of, and also it\nparts in disappointment. Disappointment\nat yourself, where silence emanates from\nyour mouth, unable to respond to the girl\nstanding in front of you, where she is right.\n\n"Summer... I..." Summer-Rain lifts her hand\nup to prevent you for saying anything as\nher she turns her head away. "I'm just\ngoing to the bathroom, Starboy. I... Don't\nwait up, ok? I'll be back before you know it."\n\nShe opens your room door and makes a\nbeeline for the bathroom, as you look at the\ndifferent characters of Vanguard Princess on\nthe screen, Saki and Kaede staring down\neach other. The door to the bathroom clicks\nshut and you spring forward, rushing towards\nthe bathroom as you finally snap out of your\ndaze.\n\nPlaying Vanguard Princess allowed you to\navoid the pain at a dark time in your life, but\nnow it has reopened old wounds. All it did\nwas gloss over lingering moments and\nmemories from a better time.

Simplistic in it's nature the game manages to charm it's players with it's character diversity and easy controls. Gamers might find themselves asking the question "How in the world do I cast super moves" in the beginning but will soon find out casting them is a piece of sweet cake that landed on their plate unknowingly. Without a multitude of options in the main menu the player is left to wonder "Where's the rest?" but that awkward sensation vanishes the moment you select one of the two options provided. There is a virtual manual provided by Steam as always for those who want to know everything before they fire up the game but it's as thin as paper and rightfully so considering the fact that the whole game is based on the movement keys, a weak attack, a medium attack, a strong one and a parry. The game leaves a fresh trail of "I want more" in it's wake and delivers on it's promise. If only there was more to it. As an anime fan myself I am left to wonder why exactly is the game so short. Finishing it you soon realise that the only replayability stands with trying the next character and so on so forth until you beat all the enemy characters with each one of the characters available and with the first 5 Free Steam trading cards in your inventory and a little chipping in on the side in the form of 20 and up to 30 pence price per card you soon come to realise that you got your badge and there's nothing left to do. That's not to say that the game hasn't got the X factor as with any other game of this genre, if you got someone to play with all the better. But at this low price I would say it's a must have for any pc gamer than enjoys this type of games. If I had to describe the game in one short sentence that would be:\n\n"It's a well designed, captivating and exciting piece of art for as long as it lasts and well worth the price tag."","October 23, 2014","true","2.0"," 13 of 24 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","13","24","0","0"

A controller is really the only way to play effectively.\n\nAnd the review:\nAs I said in the TL;DR version, this is a fighting game with a horrible story, some cheap boss moves, a few interesting fight/game mechanics and a tokyo sized dump of pantsu anime waifu ecchi fanservice oppai cleavage showing spectacular. That's pretty much it. There's no online play only local vs mode and an arcade mode that is really linear and with no options to change anything or view anything. Also there's no pause menu, but you can pause and view what the controls are.\n\nLet's see, there's around 10 characters: a loli with a pedo bear, I mean teddy bear, that grapples, a school girl, a sports girl, etc etc etc, and a Tenchi Muyo Ryoko-esq girl with big guns and pistols. wait big oppai and pistols.. oh and she's not wearing any pantsu... So there's that. Also there's a set of 5 sub characters that support your fighter as you fight, which is that interesting game mechanic I mentioned. The artwork is pretty good and the backgrounds are interesting and vary in style from one to the next, so it's nice not playing cookie cutter levels every single level, but this is a 2d fighting game so it's not like you can really enjoy the game's scenery when you're button mashing hard with only one hand on the controller. FYI you can play with two hands, but only if you're a member of /r/nofap.\n\nSeriously though, This game is probably worth 5 bucks if this is your sort of thing and 2-4 hours of gameplay is justifiable to you, otherwise get it on sale, as I've seen it go on sale frequently. And again don't buy the Hilda Rize DLC cause you get that for free in the Lilith DLC, along with 2 more stages and some better songs. Imo the Lillith DLC is barely worth it at 50% off when I got it, but it literally adds almost nothing to the game (except Hilda) so it's purely cosmetic. They could easily add another stage or a campaign mode with a map or something, but as this was an already released game long ago and this is a newer updated version with exxxtra pantsu I will continue to support it. Actually if they made a CP2 wait I mean VP2 then I'd support them as long as they don't cut as many corners as they did here.","October 30, 2014","true","2.7"," 16 of 30 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","16","30","0","0"

It kinda feels unfinished to a certain degree and I've tried all the controllers in my house and none of them are supported by the game. If it had controller support it would be much better, but for now I have to use a Keypad with a small joystick on it (Tartarus) to even be able to play the game. The default keyboard controls are way messed up and are spread out. This is a fun fighting game though with some Lewd elements to attract a larger group.

You'll need to understand how the combat and the character works, so you can push your way to victory.\n\nIn this game you have some assist characters that are small and actually cute, the game has nice graphics, so it is cute everywhere. These assist characters actually are kinda hard to get the intuition of them, so you'll also need to understand them.\n\nThis game has some ecchi appeal, so if you get easily offended by that, it is not for you. Also, this game lacks some options ingame, being too simple, as in, you probably will only use the arcade menu, and also it lacks a online multiplayer that could improve the replayability of the game, since it also does not have any history at all.\n\nBut, this game is pretty cheap, and you can buy it at an even less cost in a sale, and also you can have fun with it, so you can buy it and have some fun. Also, if you have some local friend, it is also a nice plus to the game.","November 24, 2015","true","5.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Second, It's quite supported, it has trading cards, has a workshop, controller support. I would say, it is recommended if you like fighting games, honestly it's not that bad. The game itself has quite an outdated graphics yet its still comparable to the kinds of Blazblue and skullgirls and yes its cheaper. It also has trading cards that prices quite high if your aiming for a partial cashback from the cards. What's more is that it has some great profile backrounds so overall, if it's on sale, or if you have the money, buy it. If you want a decent anime-style profile backrounds, buy it and if you're lonely or your crush just got a bf (my current life conflicts), this game helps you a lot.","December 4, 2015","true","4.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It sports an all female roster of fighters to choose from with their own quirks and what not. Each fighter is animated beautifully and with lucious detail. The soundtrack is excellent and fighting is very remeniscent of Street Fighter II. The main difference being that you get to choose a partner to tag along with you in every fight with their own enery bar (not life bar because they can't get knocked out only interrupted. You also get an energy bar of your own just like in any other modern day fighter. They are all also female. It took a while getting used to a four button fighter but, having a controller handy made the transition all the easier. The game also has a parrying system like in Street Fighter Alpha but, unlike Street Fighter Alpha where you pushed forward to parry, Vanguard Princess has it's own dedicated button (which makes the game more of a three button fighter come to think of it). If it wasn't for the reputation this kind of media already had, I would have gladly recommended it to most of my friends.","January 6","true","8.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So, if you like fighting games with cute anime girls and not much of a story (pretty much no story at all) then this is for you. But really I recommend only getting this if you own a controller.\n\nOtherwise, the art is great, voices are pretty much the same for each and no real voice acting is included. The only time they really speak is after the battles and it's in Japanese not English so I've no idea what they're saying.\n\nGreat for a cheap game, but not a stand-out or unique one admist the many other fighting games out there. Personally, I love the art so much that I just know I'm going to replay this game again and again.

So, if you like fighting games with cute anime girls and not much of a story (pretty much no story at all) then this is for you. But really I recommend only getting this if you own a controller.\n\nOtherwise, the art is great, voices are pretty much the same for each and no real voice acting is included. The only time they really speak is after the battles and it's in Japanese not English so I've no idea what they're saying.\n\nGreat for a cheap game, but not a stand-out or unique one admist the many other fighting games out there. Personally, I love the art so much that I just know I'm going to replay this game again and again. It's too cute and happy not to do so.","August 16, 2015","true","0.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Keelut/recommended/262150/","Keelut","Keelut","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Keelut/","135 products in account","Let me start by saying that if you are into fighting games and cute anime girls this will likely be up your alley and this is a well done in terms of a fighting game (so long as you know what you are doing.)\n\nThat being said this is why I would not recommend this as of right now (I am hoping some patches will come down the line that will allow these issues to be fixed)\n\n*First off, the game will literally have only two options if you are not checking the window options (This can be bad seeing that it has a full screen though you will not likely use this and I'll explain why later) Those being arcade and VS. IF you accidently choose arcade there is no back button. You WILL have to choose a character start it up then restart the game or restart it by closing it and re-opening it. There is an opening cut scene and it does respond to every input so mashing the controlls to either reset or skip the intro is like saying yes if it gets to the choosing screen. (ALMOST EVERY BUTTON IS LIKE CHOOSING YES). If you are wanting to train however, you will likely be having to look up a guide because there is no quick way to get to it and you will have to be using a second player remote regardless. Also if you want to change anything because even if you do activate practice mode, it will have a timer for some ungodly reason.. You will have to go up to tab on the window to fix the timer. Also prior to going into a VS match (the only way you can get practice mode) You will not see your characters move sheet and nor will you see it going into the game. You will literally have to either write it down or have another window open to try and deal with this. (Sorry if that comes off as lazy but I havn't dealt with this kind of stuff in a game I paid for since the super nintendo era...)\n\n*Second off the game does say it has full controller support. This is half true, if you are like me you may be using a xbox 360 wireless controller to try and play this. First off the remote will work, however you better be good with your d-pad otherwise you will likely have to find a program to fix this issue (there is a guide recommending a program that will cost $9.99 unless you plan on getting it another way) Also if you have a second xbox 360 controller... TOO BAD! The second controller won't. For some reason the game always picks it up as the second. This might be due to my Nostromo pad but if I leave that unplugged while starting up the game it will cause the xbox remote not work at all.(Second controller thing might just be me but the fact I am dealing with this means that certain drivers will ruin the game. I have many other games that do not like nostromo but usually unplugging it fixes it. This one doesn't like it at all.)\n\n*Third the game will easily begin breaking and or crashing under any stress. This means if you plan on checking out the costumes or want to skip cutscenes you will quickly learn not to. Also if you try to place it in full window mode it will begin to flicker (at least with me this does) And it's not something that is fun for the eyes. It's fine if this was in beta but.. it looks like this has been released for a few months with dlc.\n\nI would much rather prefer to recommend this than to give it a bad review but... well the game needs so much needed love and I'll just leave it at that.\n\n","July 7, 2014","false","2.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

For hardcore D-pad enthusiasts there are several guides on the Community Hub on how to configure an Xbox D-pad, PS3 controller or fightstick to work with the game, which requires the use of third party programmes so I didn't bother with it.\n\nWith only two modes, a story mode and a VS mode that can double up as a practice mode, this game is pretty light on content.. but is also light on your wallet so take that how you will. Ten fighters and five support characters gives a pretty well rounded roster, with some characters such as Luna (AKA Boobs McPistols) standing out as having a pretty unique playstyle not seen in many fighters. My main entertainment from this game came from trying out each character and support combinations and then putting them to the test in the story mode, however the lack of an in-game online mode means that you won't be trying out your combinations against particularly intelligent opponents.\n\nIt should also be noted that this game was originally freeware, and can be downloaded for free in a very similar state to the steam version albeit in Japanese and not the English translation that you get from purchasing it. I would recommend trying it out for free before purchasing it. http://www.g4g.it/2012/11/30/vanguard-princess-v1-08-english-version/ (pretty sure this link works ...)\n\nMy verdict:\n\nWould I show this game to my family and friends? No.\nDoes this game explain itself very well? No.\nWill you suddenly realise that making these cute, fictional girls fight is cruel and sit there contemplating the complexites of idle animations? Maybe.\n\nBut I still think that this game is an enjoyable and well animated fighting game for the price, especially considering it was all made by one guy.\n\n","August 30, 2014","true","13.1"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

It is a 2v2 style fighter in that you select a primary fighter and an assisting fighter, the majority of combinations are tied to the primary fighter with the secondary being controlled through a button bind which acts in the same manner as one of your attacks (weak/heavy, punch/kick etc.). This design element adds great value and unique gameplay as you can mix and match primary fighters with assist fighters to a variety of effects and combo potentials. The game does feel cheap by certain design choices (character/UI/mode wise), but considering it is an indie project with a very small development the value is outstanding albeit odd for this game as it offers quality graphics, balance and gameplay. Recommended for fighting game fans if you can get past the design choices.","September 25, 2014","true","3.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

I'm a long time fighting game player, so it was quite easy to pick up the basics of this game.\n\nIt's got a neat twist on the use of assists. Rather than just a single button press, you can use directions in addition to the press and the assists will do different things (depending on the amount of meter they have.)There's a button mapped just for parries and that can be a more advanced tactic than your standard figting game. I did not have any problems with the use of a fight stick. Everything worked right on the first try. I am not sure what the bug is that is causing other users to have issues with fightpads/sticks.\n\nI installed the Director's Cut, but I didn't see any of the "mature" content. It flies by so fast that you really have to be looking for it. (or just check the community hub, they've spent the time and taken screen shots). The tiny resolution is a bit of a pain, as you're going to have to guess on the proper aspect ratio when enlarging the screen.\n\nOverall, I'm happy to have purchaed it, I look forward to seeing how different assists compliment the main characters. I see the promise of some obnoxious juggles. (juggles, not jiggles).   It looks to be a solid game and I hope people do not overlook it due to the anime style.","March 4, 2014","true","0.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

The characters are interesting, the mechanics are (mostly) fair, and the game brings all the things you like from various fighters; Some of the characters even have similar movement and strategy schemes from classic titles like Street Fighter, KOF and Guilty Gear. Plus, you have your Arcana Heart buddy system, only your buddy can get knocked away and disabled temporarily like in Marvel vs. Capcom. Best of all, your guard cancels are free -Yes, free! They cost no special meter- and almost all of your combos come off guard cancels perfectly. Moreover, grabs are crucial as well as corner management, cross-ups and tripping.\n\nSome of the problems you're going to dislike are, the training mode is wonky and hard to figure out how to enable. The D pad on your Xbox controller is going to require some manual configuration in Xinput. The pause does not allow you to see your character sprite and freeze frame to oogle your favorite animation frames. No online play or direct connect means you're gonna be playing by yourself a lot. Worst of all, special moves that require you to press two buttons do NOT go off the way you want them to; The timing is somehow different from how you input other arrow/button combinations to do other moves.\n\nAll in all, it's fun for what it is and it isn't expensive. 9 out of 10. I'll grade sequels and future updates more harshly. It's been several years since the release, so I gotta believe better things are coming from the devs.","October 28, 2014","true","1.7"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","0"

The fights went pretty fast and unless you know your character, it's hard to know what you are doing. However, once you mastered the controls of a character, fights became really intense where your reactivity is brought to its limits. Moreover, it's a trully beautiful games, using japanese manga style graphics (which I love). Musics, voices and sounds are also good and manage successfully to instaure a good atmosphere.\nI must insist on the fact that it is a hard game, a VERY hard game, and it is really pleasant to see one which can resist you because those games are really rare nowadays. But, this statement is also a drawback as, in hard mode, the final boss is sincerely unbeatable (I only manage to beat him twice in more than 10 hours of playing). This is the main flaw of this game : its final boss is just going to drive you mad. I do not understand the interest of setting a boss like that, because, that character aside, there is really a good balance between the different fighters. But, Hilda, the final Boss, she is definitely broken. Of course the final boss is powerful, but it should not be that much. Fact is she can attack you from distance instantly and without any pause. She can also teleport when engage in hand-to-hand combat. So, I do not know how the IA of character is made, but she will keep spamming lasers and explosions without any delay from the other side of the arena, and if you manage to get close, most of time she will teleport instantly.\nAppart from having hulk as a boss, playing Vanguard Princess is very refreashing and amusing. Combos are well thought, and the game has a good lifespan. An excellent game for a small price, I encourage you to buy and play it (I recommend you to play with a joypad because some techniques are very hard to make using keypad only).\n\n8/10 according to me.\n\nPS : if you want to see what the boss is really capable of, buy the DLC ;)","October 21, 2014","true","22.9"," 12 of 23 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","12","23","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ChibiYasha/recommended/262150/","ChibiYasha","Chibi Yasha","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ChibiYasha/","28 products in account","Vanguard Princess is a 2d fighter known for it's all girl cast and fan service. Because of that many people overlook or dismiss that a very solid fighter underneath the visuals.\n\nGraphically the game is very colorful, detailed and animated well. (Yes fan service included) The characters and stages look like a true anime is being played right on your screen! The voice acting is very good though the music is average. Looking at the game from a art standpoint it's very shocking that only person created and animated the entire game.\n\nThe cast of fighters is very unique going from your standard shotos to advanced characters who have different stances and strings. Special moves and combos are simple like the classic Street Fighter 2. You also have super moves and perrys similar to Street Fighter 3: Third Strike. What set's this apart from other fighters and adds depth is that you have assist characters. This is nothing new to fighters however how they are used is very unique. You always have them available and because of so, you are controlling two fighters at once. This can get hectic as you must not only pay attention to both of your fighters but also the other players two fighters. You have a assist bar that constantly refills like your super bar. You have a selection of attacks that your assist can use and each attack (depending on strength) will take a portion of the bar. Being smart about what attack to use and when is key as they can build combos or pressure strings. You must also be careful as the person on defense can use the assist perry and if successful, can disable your assist for a few seconds leaving you at a huge disadvantage. The key is to select the assist for your play style as some assists are better suited for combos, defense or pressure.\n\nThe main problem with this game is the fact that it was made using a very old fighter maker engine. Because of so you are limited to story mode and versus mode. Practice mode is available but you must go into vs mode and manually start it. This is different depending on your button set up but mine is the p and e keys at the same time. I have heard that this game have problems with some controllers but I had no issues. I used two different controllers with no problems so my advise is to use a controller to keyboard program like joy2key if your controller don't work. Being that this is a very old engine it has no net play however a external program was made so that you can play with friends online and from my experience, it worked pretty well.\n\nOverall it's not the best fighter out there but it is definitely fun. The story mode is basic and tough (even on easy) thanks it its very cheap SNK style end boss. If you have a friend to play with locally or willing to seek and find some players online then it has plenty of replay value.

I honestly didn't think Vanguard Princess was much of a hype until I attended Fanime2013 (or 2012, I forget) and there was an actual panel and game room with people competitively playing it. Well! The girls in this 2D fighter are super cute, and the move-sets are pretty impressive. I was contemplating about cosplaying one of the girls myself. I like this game a lot.

It's been increasingly getting better and better every year. With newer updates and characters that were added throughout the years. And for now this year, it's a steam compatible game! Not only that there's a director's cut version for those of you naughty people out there who are into anime erotica stuff. Come'on let's all face why 30/20/50 of the buyers are either anime lovers or into fighers or in this case into skimppy outfits. Either way this game is great to play for kickbacks with friends. It's really user friendly since there isn't 1 minute combo system to master. Also it's cheaper to pick it up now since it's on sale. unless you lucky dogs already have a key given during the groupee sale. My only complaint for the game was that there wasn't an official online mode, so you could play with friends all around. But in the end of the day, it's a win win right? I mean who wouldn't wanna kickback to a skimppy fighter once in awhile! xD","March 4, 2014","true","3.8"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

This Fighter is better than most licensed mainstream stuff (I'm looking at you, Super Street Fighter IV)\nThe mechanics and characters are really balanced enough, the gameplay is like Street Fighter 2, that means you have to relay more on footsies and reading your opponent than making long combos and that.\n\nAnd there's a character for everyone.

Luna-a gunslinger, bounty hunter. Able to change stances with each special melee or shot of the gun. Must maintain bullets for effective momentum. Very open to attack when reloading. If you ever played Guilty Gear Xrd, Sin is the same way, having to eat to keep strong gameplay but not as open to attack like Luna's reload specials.\n\n2. Lilith-self proclaimed daughter of satan. Grappler, more similiar to king of fighter grapple style characters.-(Shermie or Yashiro or Clark or even Alex from sf3) She one of the funnest grapplers to play as cause of the humor she brings and the suprising power her grab specials displays. Feels like she came from Disgaea series.\n\n3. Natalia-religious fighter with a pile bunker on her arm from an unknown nation.\nSpecials are like boxer from street fighter except she can go through projectile with her dash punches. Has a great command grab special to make her even more dangerous up close.\n\n4./5. Saki and Yui-both resemble more to ky/sol of guilt gear or kyo/iori of king of fighters of this game. Both are sword wielders.\nSaki can range easier with projectiles cause she has normals that summon petals fast and Yui has slower/long reaching normals/physical specials that stuns longer but she summons petals at much lower rate. They do not resemble each other what so ever in animation or appearance like those I mentioned above. What I like about them is what they should do to Ryu/Ken/Akuma.\n\n6. Ayane-archer with waning powers. Lost her eye in the past. maybe the fastest range attack in the game. Range expert. Arrows regenerate in time-4 max.\n\n7. Kaede-assassin with no memory of her past. A very mobile character with adon style(jaguar tooth in a way) wall attacks and plenty of feint specials.\n\n8. Kurumi-a average looking girl with unique powers. The assist expert that does co op attacks with them. Can combo some of her normals into each other. The dlc 5th assist, I dont think she has any co op attacks with that one. Not sure about the 4rth assist either since I dont use her much.\n\n9. Eri-Tonfa expert and a super soldier suprising enough.-you wouldnt know from what shes wearing. Close range master. Specials hit overhead or low or even behind.\n\n10. Haruka-mage. Another range expert. Can set up temporary walls that damage foes on contact to stall them.\n\n4 ASSIST CHOICES if you got the free directors cut add on, dont know why you wouldnt get that free add on-(5 if you have the dlc one which isnt really worth the cash)\n\n(Not all specials or super moves or unique normals are listed in the manual like Lilith s flame thrower. Some characters even have second supers.)\n\nThe GOOD\n\nGameplay\nIt is actually a 2d side scroll 1 on 1 with asist partners. All fighters are female. Street Fighter Third Strike parry system. Counter hit combo advantages. asist penalties also work well to make sure you cant go crazy with your helper asists.  The voice overs are jpnese.(thank god cause most dubbed va are usually bad) Combos are exact and strict which is good for serious pvp. Cannot just cancel normals into special moves, forcing players to think on how to use their assist for combos or defense.\n\ngood looking 2d fighter with detailed sprites on fighters and backgrounds. Smooth animations.\n\ncompatible with controller pad(not sure on which ones though. I know it works with my afterglow ps3 and my wired 360 one)\n\nNot just a broken combo crazy game like marvel vs capcom 3. Rewards great defensive play if you work hard to master it.\n\nTHE BAD\nonly 2 modes.\nvs offline mode(not designed well practice mode. mostly just using 2 player as a dummy) and arcade.(arcade has easy, normal and hard setting.) Needs way more modes.\n\nCheap last boss at the end of arcade mode. Rivals SNK s annoying bosses. Close range characters like Lilith will get destroyed a ton when you reach the boss. The easiest way to beat her is time out with range asist. A chip battle. Trying to KO her will get you killed. She has infinite helper spam too that will kill your close range approach.\n\nConclusion\ndespite there only  being 3 modes, you can appreciate the creativeness of the game. very nice looking 2d fighter. I recommend it cause it has more creativity/better looking than street fighter 4 and its only indie game too. It has alot of defensive depth which is rare on new gen fighters these days. Rewards reaction on counter hits, footies and great space control as well.-like street fighter. 3 out of 5. It would be a 4 if it had more modes of play, a great fighting game has a overall well rounded strength in all aspects, not just focused on one strength. This title has creativity/one of the best looking 2d fighters, great combat gameplay and amazing matching voice over talent to the characters.","March 12, 2015","true","7.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Which means: few characters (it may turn some people down, but I miss those [OLD] times when you had only a dozen of characters to choose from. Modern games with their 30, 40 characters to choose from are usually overwhelming), few special moves (and easy, classic ones like "hadouken" or "shoruyken" motions), basic combos;\n- Good character design! This is a mash up of all the anime cliches will find out there. If you are an Anime fan, you'll most likely recognize the "base" of a lot of characters there;\n- Music and sounds (with voice!) are actually good also;\n- And if you are really, really ecchi, you'll definetly enjoy big boobed girls teamed-up with flat-chested pre-teen ones.\n- Nice playability. I haven't played much (beat the game a couple of times on Normal difficulty) to state that, but it seems the game has even some depth of play. Although it's simple to pick up and play, it seems to offer something more;\n- Cheap!\n\nThe negatives:\n- Like other people said, the Interface is a bit rough on the edges (to say the least). No in-game option menu, no native controller support (it may sound weird, but the whole interface has an RPG Maker feeling to it!) and so on;\n- No easily accessible Move List (although, personally, I come from a time where games didn't give you in-game Move List. If you didn't have the manual at hand, you pretty much had to figure it out yourself. I've done that dozens of times in my child/teenagehood. So, newer generations, stop complaining!);\n- AI may seem kinda cheap at first, but once you get the hang of it, you realise that the AI is actually poor. You can beat the game almost only with normal moves (yes, Hilda included! She has a 'pattern' to attack that you once realise and fit that pattern into you character's style of gameplay, she isn't that hard at all).\n\n\nSo, bottom line is:\nIf you are into anime girls, wants an honest ecchi game, with actual nice gameplay (don't just expect a Street Fighter Alpha level of playability, though!), a game that is straight-to-the-action (although a bit TOO straight), with an honest cheap price, I can not see why not recommend it.\n\nDon't expect much and you can have a couple of hours of fun!","March 3, 2014","true","1.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

But I believe I have a unique perspective on this one:\n\nI don't like fighting games. They just aren't my thing. Yet, I find this game--this very fan-servicey game--to be enjoyable enough to keep playing. Maybe because I look at it from the "one guy made this whole thing whoamg" perspective, and the love put into it oozes out that much more.\n\nThis is not a "complex" or "deep" fighting game. As other reviews have noted, it's more in the vein of a classic Street Fighter 2 arcade fighter. Movelists are not long. Mechanics don't take much time to learn or figure out. The act of actually playing it, as a result, becomes more accessible than the MvC-esque series that I simply can't adapt toward. The colorful presentation and beautiful spritework can be taken as a lesson in art direction alone.\n\nAs far as user interface, most people's complaints are fairly validated. But none are enough to really detract from the enjoyment. Everything is simple "start the game, pick a mode GO. FIGHT. NOW."\n\nSuggest supplementary movelist guides, as many character attacks are not listed in-game. IE: Aerial Hadokens, Aerial Down+Parry, varying character-to-character on whom has access to which supplementary moves.\n\no3o","March 6, 2014","true","2.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/merithras/recommended/262150/","merithras","Merithras","http://steamcommunity.com/id/merithras/","229 products in account","Ok, so it's a fighting game where you can control and fight against relatively scantily clad ladies. Now that that is out of the way let's dig into it.\n\nif you use a 360 controller you may want to remap the buttons more to your liking, since you'll start out with the "b" and "x" 's bound to your b and x. the problem with this is, many super combo/super attacks will take pushing these 2 buttons in unison.\n\nThe sprites are well done, the physics on the sprites are well done (skirt flowing, hair flowing, boob jiggle, it's all there). The system itself (outside of the partners) is little more or less complicated that your average street fighter fare.\n\nThe partner system is interesting to say the least. you gain your partner bar as the fight goes on, and once you have a number, you can use certain abilities for said partner. The partner will use different abilities depending on which direction you're holding when you push said partner button, anything from little stuns, to machine guns, to screen filling blasts can be done by partners, some even shield you or some other fun.\n\nThe story is generally pretty sparse, you're one of several young ladies, scantily clad or otherwise, trying to figure out what happened during some massive explosion and find either a friend, or a target for your assassination contract, or a relative, any other standard character hook, you them meet someone you knew,know, remembers you, whatever. Then some story is said, and you fight. you then have a few more fights until you get to the boss.... speaking of the boss..\n\nI have one complaint, one HUGE complaint. The boss is outright broken. This fight (and only this fight) is so whacked it's unimaginable. she has way too many invincibility frames and outright immunities ( she was stunned [ as in unable to do anything and having birds above her head] and i used the character i was using's [kaede hioh] super attack, and it activated, she zoomed towards hilde and.... the strike went right through her sprite, doing no damage.\n\nAlso, if you don't like luck in your fighting games, this boss will not amuse you. she constantly spams, teleports, and it's nearly impossible to get close to her unless luck is on your side. I have beaten her twice so far, and they were both due to complete luck. i know the combinations, i know how they work, i've seen every one of hilde's attacks,  however she spams them so much that unless you teleport yourself, or can manage to go through her nearly infinite blasts, you'll likely not lay a hand on her.  It's like fighting a button masher, her attacks come out of nowhere, have very little build time, and either do an insane number of hits, or a large amount of damage.   best of all is this surprise blast that happens immediatly under you.\n\nBack to point however. Good sprites, good controls, i'd generally recommend it, the only glaring nightmare is the boss. It at least has a story, and the mechanics are sound, but other than that big boss problem, i recommend it.\n\nEDIT: Secondarily. to people who say " it's not for the single player, this game is there for the multiplayer". In my opinion a game should be able to stand on its own single player, the multi player is extra.","December 17, 2014","true","3.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

But dont let this put you off as when you do succeed it feels even better!\n\nI would massivley advise using a controller because the game becomes undecipherable with the keyboard as there is no tutorial or control menu.\n\nOne massive pro for this game is the soundtrack. All of the stages have great music that fits in perfectly to the game. I would happily buy the ost on its own.\n\nOverall this game is very fun and definitley worth the asking price. As I said before if you are a fan of anime this game is for you, even if it is just for the gorgeous visuals (if you know what i mean).","July 5, 2014","true","3.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The sidekick you choose doesn't seem to have one at all =(\n\nFighting is pretty much like any other fighting game.

This game is a doujin fighter through and through and options to adjust the game for use are limited.\n\nThe two big issues for me from a technical aspect that some may need to know about prior to purchase are...\n\n1. The gamepad support is not proper xinput so while it will detect a 360 pad it won't work properly with it out of the gate.  Buttons register but dpad/analog sticks do not work.  You'll need a 3rd party application like xpadder to use one with this game.\n\n2. Fullscreen (when it works...just crashes for me on win 8.1) is stretched if on a widescreen display despite what the images on the games store page imply (kept aspect ratio with borders on widescreen display.\n\nAside from that the game plays fine on a modern system and cheap boss aside is a pretty decent (if limited) fighter.

With an all female-cast, of playable fighters, this is kinda interesting, on the way they did it. The character designs are also quite interesting and unusual.\nI can guarantee that I got this from the old "Humble Weekly Bundle", but this time, they showed some obscure indie games. But this is one of those that I actually found interesting, and it only costed me about a buck, for how much my brother payed for it. (The rest, besides the first three were not as interesting, in my opinion.\nCould this have been worth trying out? Yes; it's a rather obscure fighting game, with a strange charm similar to that, of "Sailor Moon", (without having to focus on the whole straight-out "magical girl" genre) but overall, all the fighters in the game happen to contain some interesting female character designs, which don't look quite all the same, like the heroines, in "Sailor Moon"; that I kinda like!","August 5, 2015","true","0.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The moves are incredible, simple enought o be able to pull off whilst button mashing but still good enough that you'll be able to put them to good use if you know what you're doing. I honestly found myself just button mashing for a fair while haha.\n\nYou get 2 modes Arcade and VS, it does support DS3 controllers via better DS3 and 360 controllers though you'll have to fiddle with settings a tad to get them managable. The menu sits in a toolbar on the screen window so if you are fullscreen you'll need to hit f4 to access it which can be a pain. For versus, changing stages is also done via the window toolbar which is sloppy but hey, it's not game-breaking.\n\nWhat can be game-breaking is the game's occasional all-out refusal to accept any input commands resulting in an 'I.T. Crowd' esque, turning it off and on again. There doesn't appear to be any particular trigger for this although so far it's only happened outside of gameplay in the menu and so forth and the mouse is never affected.\n\nI'd easily recommend this game at the price especially for how different it is!\n8.5/10","November 18, 2014","true","6.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

This game is a doujin fighter through and through and options to adjust the game for use are limited.\n\nThe two big issues for me from a technical aspect that some may need to know about prior to purchase are...\n\n1. The gamepad support is not proper xinput so while it will detect a 360 pad it won't work properly with it out of the gate.  Buttons register but dpad/analog sticks do not work.  You'll need a 3rd party application like xpadder to use one with this game.\n\n2. Fullscreen (when it works...just crashes for me on win 8.1) is stretched if on a widescreen display despite what the images on the games store page imply (kept aspect ratio with borders on widescreen display.\n\nAside from that the game plays fine on a modern system and cheap boss aside is a pretty decent (if limited) fighter.

Lilith DLC includes Hilda.)\n++Really nice music\n+Awesome anime girls (moe and panty shots included)\n\n--Insane learning curve\n-Semi-difficult with keyboard alone\n\n+/-Almost all characters share the same combo/Special Move inputs (this could be good/bad depending on your view)\n\n[[ IF YOU PLAY KEYBOARD STYLE LIKE ME, DISABLE THE GAME CONTROLER OPTION VIA GAME MENU AND REBIND KEYS BEFORE DOING ANYTHING ]]\n\nAs I'm used to these types of fighting games I mostly saw BlazeBlue in this and thought it was pretty similar. I was right. Technically all 2D fighters are the same, but that's another discussion. For the most part I love it. The anime characters are interesting, but with the amount of anime nowadays, you could probably say they remind you of other series/characters--whether in games or another.\n\nJumping straight into the Arcade mode is a very big NO. I got my *** kicked so bad and won the first match by button mashing. The second fight was impossible. Not because it was difficult, it's because I didn't know how to play it. By luck I got back to the menu screen and did a complete overhaul of the keybindings through trial and error. I find it works best if you use ASD for Light, Mid, and Heavy attacks respectively. W for Parry, and Q for support. And the Directional Arrows for movement. This works best for me. After 5min of Arcade sessions for practice you can easily learn many of the combos. I learned all the combos for all the fighters so I know how to challenge them with whichever character I choose to play as. (Versus may not have an AI, but it's perfect for learning how to play the game.)\n\nHowever, the Story mode is still relentless. The difficulty, even knowing how to form combos, was still a little high. The first few matches were easy, but difficulty continues to rise. I haven't beat it yet but I'm sure I will if I sit and focus. Animation wise there's lots of motion. LOTS of motion. Lots of bouncing for each character showing off their assets. Overall it is smooth and seems to flow pretty nicely. The only downside is that you can sometimes see the tiny white pixels around the fighters. They're even noticable in the Character Select screen. This is a small detail I can look over.\n\nAs for the Support they added into the game. I honestly don't use them. Only rarely do I do or find them useful. The music on the other hand, now that's something to get into. Just about every track--except for maybe three--I really loved causing my foot to tap while I'm laying down combos. (The Shrine music is my favorite.)\n\nAt this point this is all I really have to say. Hopefully, if you read this, will help those that play Keyboard style. I like Game Controllers as well, but PC games MUST be played using the keyboard. At least for me anyways. It adds a difficulty that many people hate, but is oh so satisfying when you show your stuff.","November 28, 2014","true","1.1"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","10","21","0","0"

A place containing not just vanguard princesses, but bubblegum crises, robots that drill through universes, homoerotic vampires being pursued by muscular men with magic demons, dandy guys in space, little girls running item shops, the most convoluted fighting game storyline ever written, women who interact through games of Match 3 and Hyperdimension Neptunia.\n\nReady yourself as you step into this world, for I cannot promise you will come out the same person you are today, if you ever emerge at all. You may find yourself becoming unnaturally attached to one of the many denizens, claiming a so-called waifu, or a husbando, or some bizarre mix of both, and collecting frivolous merchandise to line the walls of your personal cavern of kawaii. As you descend into this world, you may find yourself growing distant from those around you, only being able to form a connection with those who have entered into the breach with you. However, should you accept these consequences, then it is time to enter the world of anime.\n\nBe wary, my friend. Not all kawaii desus are as moe as they may first seem.","February 11, 2015","true","3.6"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","47","9","19","12","0"

The most prominent character is probably the one most people would recognize; that of course being, Luna Himeki..

Guilty Gear, Blazblue just to name a few (or if you like the female characters scene, Skullgirls). The fighting in this game is pretty decent really but in all honesty.. with the drawbacks of this game (few gamemodes, engine limits and no online play) the only thing going for it is the 'anime appeal' by which we all know implies to otaku culture. Whilst playing this game, I can't help but expect something 'bad' to happen to one of the characters at any given time.. but that may be a different problem I'm dealing with, oh well.\n\nIn short: good game but there's much better among the genre, take your pick.","March 4, 2014","true","4.2"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Igamiwarrior/recommended/262150/","Igamiwarrior","Niggle Navigator","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Igamiwarrior/","492 products in account","The first thing anyone notices in Vanguard Princess is the hypersexualization of its all-female cast. In this 2D fighter, the skirts are short, the legs are long, and the chests are, well, you get the idea. It's a treat for some, but for those who scoff at this most basic of carnal pleasures, takes heed: behind all the eye candy rests a well-designed fighting engine that addresses several annoyances found in other contemporary fighters. Developer Tomoaki Sugeno  has built a game whose pacing feels akin to Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3--with a little more overwhelming kawaii. Vanguard Princess saves its spectacle for the characters, while keeping its combat fast and focused.\n\nVanguard Princess lets you bring two different characters to a fight, even if your opponent chooses a different combination. These different combinations provide interesting variability to how the game plays. One two-person team can deal and withstand more damage than those of another two-person team; however, that two-person can team lose the ability to call for assist attacks, to link hyper combos, or to recover lost health while verbarmajorat sempai mode is down. This creates a natural balance to keep one combination from having an overwhelming advantage over the other.\nAdjustable teams naturally scale the complexity as well. Having characters on a team means more variables to internalize during a fight. Two, superpowered fighter is easier to manage than two average-strength ones. This trade-off between raw strength and effecter mispells helps accommodate a wider skill range. This isn't to say that Vanguard Princess lacks depth. Each character feels wildly distinct from the rest. Even the two projectile-focused fighters--Luna and Ayane--handle differently. Luna fills the screen with fast-moving projectiles, while Ayane uses timed explosives and long-range pokes. With only ten characters, Vanguard Princess roster may not be as large as other fighters--but its combatants are nicely varied.\n\nThe underlying fighting system is equally rich, with several smart and simple alternatives for typical fighting game annoyances such as high/low unblockables and infinite loops. An unblockable refers to a combination of simultaneous attacks that are impossible to guard against. These are accepted in some fighters, but Vanguard Princess automatically protects you if you block part of an unblockable combination. Infinite loops are just what they sound like: attack strings that can be repeated indefinitely. Most fighters patch these out on a case-by-case basis, but Vanguard Princess just says "no" with its Infinity Breaker. This quick, invulnerable attack is available only when an infinite is detected, it deals no damage, and it knocks the opponent away.\n\nThese and other design choices let the game be a little more flexible with what tools it gives you. Assist attacks are a great example. In Vanguard Princess you can enter a custom assist attack--and it can be any single attack you want if you use your imagination. Normally this would lead to some nasty, but the game doesn't have to worry about such fakku, since there are hard stops in place to prevent that. This opens up a lot more creative freedom for team synergy and combo potential. Vanguard Princess is filled with these little touches that should make any fighting fan happy.\n\nIf a healthy dose of cleavage also puts a smile on your face, then Vanguard Princess can provide. The game is a well-shaken cocktail of violence and erotica served with a side of smooth milk. Blow for blow, it pairs devastating uppercuts with all the up-skirt shots a hot-blooded enthusiast can handle. It's difficult not to have an extreme reaction, whether positive or sexual, to some of these character designs. It's a risque style that weighs potential alienation against exposure. And while exaggerated, hourglass figures aren't new to video games, their sheer abundance here can be embarrassing for members of some species.\n\nThe Vanguard Princess universe is centered on a malevolent MacGuffin called the Vanguard Princess. Each character has her own reason for hunting her, and the narrative tries harder than most fighting game narratives to establish reasonable motivations. The story mode is a typical collection of fights interspersed with dialogue. These scenes are filled with unique artwork that fleshes out the vast array of supporting characters working behind the scenes. Vs mode is available as well.\n\nWhile the story is serviceable, the tutorials are where the game excels. They explain some fundamental concepts that have gone unspoken in many other fighting games (the basics of movement, defending against cross-ups, and capitalizing on hit confirmation) and give you a better understanding of how to approach a fight. They can help you succeed not only in Vanguard Princess, but in life. However, one critical element is missing.          It's an unnecessary hurdle for players who are unfamiliar with these characters, which is just about everyone. Hopefully a waifu will be patched in later, but for now its absence is missed.\n\nOnce your skills are ready, you can not take your game online for some competitive play. The backbone of Vanguard Princess' lack of online experience is the tried-and-true GGPO technology. Featured in Capcom's Street Fighter III: Third Strike Online Edition, GGPO effectively hides Internet lag by not having an online mode. The result it a fight that seems lag-free, though your character might not always attack on cue. Thankfully, as long as your RAM is in the green or yellow range, you won't be experiencing much lag of any kind.\n\nUnfortunately, the game lacks some of the modern conveniences in other fighters. Spitting support is one, which the game works around by restricting room size to only four combatants. Harem support is also absent, which is especially unfortunate since observing Vanguard Princess is an excellent way to improve your own wrist strength. Still, at the oh-so-attractive price of $5, Vanguard Princess is a great value. Its strong fighting system can stand toe-to-toe with genre regulars, while the lessons taught should be adopted in all aspects of life. There's plenty of fun to be had with the lovely ladies of Vanguard Princess, as long as you don't mind a little jiggling along the way.\n\n9.3/10","March 6, 2014","true","110.3"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","1"

No skill list, controls are wonky and they don't work all the time, poor gamepad support(initially I could use the D-pad but now it doesn't work anymore), can't change resolution and other ♥♥♥♥, no practice mode(have to go to vs mode and do some ♥♥♥♥), gamepad configuration uses buttons 1-12 or whatever instead of saying "Triangle, square, x, circle, R3, etc..."(makes sense to use 1-12 cause gamepad and all or whatever but it'd be much more convenient for the user if it could detect what kind of controller you're using and ♥♥♥♥[I'm using a PS3 controller]), can't change volume(not really a problem if you're only playing the game and not streaming any other audio source), few other things whatever. Still a kawaii ♥♥♥ game and I would LOVE to be able to play it more but it's annoying to just start.","May 18, 2014","true","0.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","1"

The final boss is also hard AF, with all the teleports and laser spams, you can't even get close to her.. I only managed to defeat her once in my 3 hours of playing this game.. (I got this game already before i bought it on Steam.)\nThe controls itself is rather easy to understand, took me around 1 hour to actually be able to string my own combos..\nAlso somehow I had more fun playing this game than playing BlazBlue, even though BB is better made and bolsters more fighters, something just sucks me into this game.. Maybe it's because Lilith is literally Minase Iori from the iDOLM@STER? Nyeh, maybe, I'll get to it later..\nAll in all, IMO, this is a reaaallly well made game.. and considering that this used to be a doujin game, to have made it on Steam is, just wow..\nNow, getting to the good and the bad parts of the game..\n\nThe Goods:\n> Assist system? That's new..\n> Pantyshots, nyeeess~\n> Graphics are pretty neat.\n> Lilith = Minase Iori from the iDOLM@STER (Doll? Check. Shiny Forehead? Check. Headbutt? Check.)\n> Hard AI makes the game challenging, but frustrating at the same time..\n> I don't get people's review about this game not working with their gamepad. The game is very responsive to my gamepad, controls are smooth.\n> Old styled graphics = Good framerate and smooth gameplay~\n\nThe Bads:\n> No Online Multiplayer.\n> No Training mode. (You can just do local VS mode though.)\n> Pause screen didn't show combo list, I got around the wiki for the movelist.\n> Unbalanced characters. (Lilith too OP, pls nerf.. So this is why they made her into a DLC..)\n> AI too hard, pls nerf..\n> Too many DLCs, why not buy the original doujin version of the game? One disc, and it got everything except Hilda in it..\n> The story of the game is not so clear, unlike BB who mindfuks you with all the time paradox and yadda yadda, the story mode is....... Short on text? maybe.. Yes, I'm the kind of guy who puts the story over graphics..\n\nBut despite all the bad things about this game, I would still recommend it.. Why? Because this game is challenging AF.. The hard AI will make you rage, I'm sure, but once you get the hang of this game, there's the sense of accomplishment, and you would want to fully master all the characters in this game..\nAlso, this is a 2D Fighting game, featuring cute girls, lolis, an idol (oh wait, wrong game てへぺろ~ ) piledrivers, brainbusters, laser spams, and lots and lots of rage quits..\nYou have been warned......","November 14, 2014","true","3.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Its plays very well and gives enough challenge and variate to warrant the already, very low price. Some say it was made by one man and is available as freeware. Well I'm here to say its all a pack of god damn lies. Google it kids.\nAnyway, the game is really lacking when it comes to video options.\nThe game has one resolution and if you go full-screen it stretches from its original 4:3 into 16:9. Unless you are playing on a 4:3 monitor in which case aspect ratio is the least of you problems. Get ready to start dicking around with the old video card options.\nAnother thing that twisted my nipple was the fact that there is no score, no ranking, nothing to unlock. Each time you play the game is like the first time you boot it up. It feels detached and cold. I want my sexy underage schoolgirl fighting games to remember who I am and welcome me by name each time I play.\n\nOverall I recommend this game to people who like everything that I like and have the exact same taste as me.

First, the game needs Achievements. I'm pretty much an Achievement hunter, and don't play many games unless they have 'em.\n\nSecond, it needs "practice mode" I don't know ANY Fighting game that do not have one to hone skills. The only way you can possibly practice is in VS mode if you have 2 controllers (or using a gamepad and keybaord, if it works like that) it's a bit difficult learning how each character works without that particular mode, that's for sure.\n\nIf you want to use an XBOX360 Controller, you'll need a 3rd party device for it to work (I.E XBOX360 Gaming reciever) it's a good thing I already owned one, otherwise, this game would be unplayable to me because I hate using the keyboard on these types of games. Some games are meant to use the kaybaord and mouse, and others a controller. if you have an XBOX360 Controller with a 3rd party device, you should be fine.\n\nLastly, if you enjoy boobs, butts and pantsu, then this is the game for you.","March 23, 2015","true","6.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

This is just like Skullgirls with the multiple characters in fights as assists and fanservice with the all-female roster and jiggling and panties and such, right?\n\n-What is happeni...\n\nOh. OH.

That just... whoa.\n\nAnd as I sat, and stared, mesmerized by the gratuitous flurry of events taking place onscreen regardless of my futile attempts at gaining some semblance of logical return for my braindead, pawing inputs on the controller; something magical and/or terrifying was taking place.\n\nI could feel, as an acute physical sensation that emanated somewhere beneath my liver, my very own sense of dignity and self-worth slowly, deliberately, yet unmistakably evaporating from each orifice on my body in ascending succession with each passing moment that I continued gawping at the screen and half-consciously pressing buttons. It was magnificent. Sublime, even. Never in all my experience of gaming did I think a game could do such a thing to my mind, to reduce me to such a state. And I'd had my share of uncomfortable and undignified gaming experiences... such as "enjoying" (if one could even call it that) the private dances and illicit sexual services in the Grand Theft Auto games, or even playing some games beyond a reasonable point ***cough*** Lollipop Chainsaw ***cough*** to unlock increasingly skimpy (and ultimately unsatisfying) costumes or art galleries.\n\nBut so far my very short time spent with this game has extended my collective sphere of gaming stimuli beyond simple discomfort or awkwardness to a point that, in my opinion, lands it nowhere short of brilliance. You may take this as saying that I can only recommend the game for the novelty of it alone, but the truth is that the game's content, taken at face value, is on such an off-putting, yet irresistably tantalizing wavelength that I'm enamored with the idea of continuing to play it (preferably with friends), and maybe even learn the ropes of it and become somewhat competent at a fighting game. That is quite an achievement. That is definitely worth my five bucks, and my praise.\n\nOverall... what can I say that hasn't already been said here? Either get it or don't. For the sake of influencing your decision, I'll leave with one of the other reviews posted by another user here...\n\n"One of the fighters isn't wearing any underwear"\n\nThat's all you really need to know, right?","April 12, 2014","true","1.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Aardcore/recommended/262150/","Aardcore","Aardcore","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Aardcore/","279 products in account","I'll be frank with anyone reading this. I didn't know what to really expect from this game since my stigma with fighting games on PC's is a lingering issue, though I come from a long LONG history about them: One Must Fall 2097 and FX Fighter come to mind. Now with that said... I know more and more fighting games are slowly making their way onto Steam, and that's awesome! Show your support with that trend and get this game.\n\nLet's also just get some of this stuff out of the way: As you can see from the screenshots, yes... there's a bit of loli going around and scantily clad women--but come on, this is video games we're talking about and a fighting game of this degree needs no explanation or attempt in being subtle... because this is a damn good fighting game. Put the visuals to the side and let them appeal later on, and you'll be all the better for it.\n\nThis is a fighter I'm trying to wrap my head around because just in the first few minutes of it, I instantly fell in love with it. The animations are beautifully rendered, the sound design is astounding (we're talking late 80's, early 90's sounding arcade sound design here! Just listen to Luna's guns and you'll know exactly what I'm talking about!) and the combat is pretty on point. The drawback is that the game is very... PAINFULLY even, barebones.\n\nThere are two modes, Story and VS Mode--but no online mode. Story mode isn't exactly your typical "Story Mode" from other fighting games which try and set up a story. This is more like a straight up Arcade Mode than anything as you hit up any of the characters and take them for a spin. It's a shame really that there is no online mode because I would definitely love to take up a match against someone else in this game!\n\nThe game also only has 10 characters, 15 in acuality, but 10 you can actually play as and 5 which are your support class characters. You can't switch to these support class characters, they are there solely for what they're supposed to be: support. Now as for the action in this game? If anyone remembers playing the ORIGINAL Guilty Gear on the Playstation, you've got a pretty good idea what this game feels like. If you haven't, I'll say that this game offers a unique feel and spin on the typical fighting game repetoire. Each character feels unique and play VERY differently from one another, and you'll most likely gravitate to one character that  suits your play style or how comfortably you smash around on the controller.\n\nThe game isn't without flaws however... given the very bare bones aspect of the game, there are points where the AI will always have the advantage over you and juggle you around. And in a way that might add to the challenge of getting used to the game's fighting system but other people may find that disagreeable.\n\nStill, for what the game has, it does everything very well and looks extremely good doing it. It has some disadvantaging quirks but I wholly support more fighting games coming onto PC and to see the company behind this particular title to push something bigger and better down the way for me to pick up, because I'm already a fan of this awesome little game with big potential!","March 16, 2014","true","8.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I do love this game, but have to be fair.\n\nPro's:\nThis game has fun characters to use, every character has a completely different fighting style and most special attacks have similar commands making it easy to remember if you are changing characters up.\n\nThe music is decent and the levels look nice. But no real story, you can get the directors cut for like 30 second conversations, then thats it.\n\nCon's:\nThe Hilda DLC is pointless. Basically if you don't enjoy playing fighters, get her. All her basic attacks are specials. Nothing more. She has no real attacks, and not real entertaining to use. I only got her because I like owning everything in fighters.\n\nThere is no real practice mode. It says to use 2 player to practice, and no online mode.\n\nYou can be having a good game then run into someone like Lilith who will spam 1 attack the entire fight.\n\nHilda is the final boss, and she is basically a 24/7 spammer. You thought Shao Kahn was bad in mk9? He atleast paused. Hilda is maybe the most poorly made fighter AI I ever seen. Basically she will use nothing but range attacks. You get close and knock her down, she will get up, teleport behind you and send you flying, and go back to the otherside, continuing her spamming..\nYou can beat her if you can learn how to keep her down.

Yeah, it's a roster of all “cute” females—and a few that might be overly endowed at that—but there’s so much more here than fan service: it’s a true fighter.\n\nI should mention right away that I’m a casual gamer (I’m no pro at fighters) and although having a second character (four all together on the screen after your opponent and their partner) took some time to get use to, the game is easy to initially learn if you take some time in practice mode.\n\nWhile the user interface lacks and getting into practice mode isn’t obvious how to activate, this game is mostly about fighting game mechanics. That said, there are some overpowered characters if you’re playing against other people, but if you like playing against the AI, it’s fun when played casually. There’s some intense combos to learn if you put in the time to learn them; and when you learn to use your partner properly, the results are devastating for your opponents.\n\nWhile most your initial opponent’s AIs will be overly easy, the following ones will progressively get challenging until you get to the end boss that all characters must face. For some characters she can be very challenging. But if you’re not winning after a few tries, go back to “Easy Mode” and practice with different partners until you find the one that suits your needs.\n\nWhile VP is all 2D sprite drawn—and not at the highest resolutions to boot—it’s a beautiful game that makes you feel like you’re fighting in an anime; and the music is some of the best I’ve heard for a fighter. On a larger budget and with a little more character balancing this game could give any top-tier fighter a run for its money.

Yeah, it's a roster of all “cute” females—and a few that might be overly endowed at that—but there’s so much more here than fan service: it’s a true fighter.\n\nI should mention right away that I’m a casual gamer (I’m no pro at fighters) and although having a second character (four all together on the screen after your opponent and their partner) took some time to get use to, the game is easy to initially learn if you take some time in practice mode.\n\nWhile the user interface lacks and getting into practice mode isn’t obvious how to activate, this game is mostly about fighting game mechanics. That said, there are some overpowered characters if you’re playing against other people, but if you like playing against the AI, it’s fun when played casually. There’s some intense combos to learn if you put in the time to learn them; and when you learn to use your partner properly, the results are devastating for your opponents.\n\nWhile most your initial opponent’s AIs will be overly easy, the following ones will progressively get challenging until you get to the end boss that all characters must face. For some characters she can be very challenging. But if you’re not winning after a few tries, go back to “Easy Mode” and practice with different partners until you find the one that suits your needs.\n\nWhile VP is all 2D sprite drawn—and not at the highest resolutions to boot—it’s a beautiful game that makes you feel like you’re fighting in an anime; and the music is some of the best I’ve heard for a fighter. On a larger budget and with a little more character balancing this game could give any top-tier fighter a run for its money. Simply put: at the price they’re asking, buy this game.","March 6, 2014","true","12.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Well are looking to pass a few hours? Are you fan of old school fighting games? Anime Girls? Moe, Moe? Well you found the right game.\n\nThe Good\nI purchased this game as a part of an indie bundle with no prior knowledge of the title, but as a veteran fighting game enthusiast, I was pleasantly surprised to find a fighter within the bunch. It's rather casual in terms with most AAA fighting games, but has plenty of charm. It's easy to pick up if you have experience with fighting games. The characters are well designed and have a total of about 6-8 moves, with usually 1-2 being special moves. On top of your main character you choose a small assistant to fight alongside you simultaneously.\n\nThe inputs for the skills give you enough wiggle room that you won’t have issues preforming skills, even with a keyboard (though a gamepad is always recommended). The attacks are flashy and fluid for most characters, so combos are never problematic. The ultimate/special skills build quickly and most have small, but cool cut-scenes, but don’t worry, they don’t take ages to finish.\n\nThe Bad\nThe stages are nothing spectacular, but fit the theme well. Same can be said with the music.\n\nThe game’s largest flaw is its absolutely horrid UI. Most of the game options are outside the actual game have to be changed through a windows menu at the title and the lack of game modes (single player/ local vs) and unlockables means you probably won’t get much in terms of replayablility. Most players are probably going to get 2-6 hours most from this game, still it was a nice random pickup from an indie bundle.","June 27, 2014","true","2.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There is no way in hell I would recommend those players.  Given that I think Street Fighter IV's tutorial system is half-hearted, this game's complete lack of anything other than "Arcade" and "Versus" modes unforgivable.  I know it's only $5, but was a bare-bone "Training" mode that simply plopped you into a sparring match with an irresponsive but invicible opponent to much to ask for?\n\nAlso, bonus fail for forcing users to use ALT+F4 to quit the game.  How freakin lazy can one be?\n\nIf you're a 2D fighting game veteran, this might be worth a quick try.  The fighting style reminds me a lot of early SNK titles....which is to say, stiff but serviceable.  The combo counter is never going to get very high, but that's OK.  The side-kick gimmick is neat -- it's not new but very few 2D fighters do it.  But just when you think the game might be OK, you face off against the final boss and run into the mother of all brick walls of difficulty spikes.  If your input device survives the ensuing rage, that's because you know when to quit.","February 6, 2015","false","1.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There is no proper way to handle zoning since the invicibility frames on a parry are stupidly easy to punish and parrying serves little purpose since all it does it open your opponent up for an attack with extremely low frame startups, which you can't follow up with due to the poor combo system.\n\nJust stick to KOF/Blazbad if you like 2D anime fighters and stick to USFIV and DOA if you like 3D fighters.\n\nfap+uninstall/10","January 15, 2015","false","1.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I'm sorry, but this is perhaps the worst 2d fighter I've ever played, and that's really diappointing. I really wanted this game to be good, I even got all the dlc so I could play it entirely from the start. But don't follow my footsteps. There are problems in every aspect of this game.\n\nThere is no way to adjust or mute the sound. The plot and dialogue are mediocre at best, a generic plot with a dues ex machina that only really differs in one dialgue and the very ending.\n\nIf you go into vs against a standstill enemy, and master the moves, then SOME of the following can be bypassed. But not much.\n\nGameplay:\nThe gameplay can be broken down into three things. The AI, balance, and controls. All three are completely broken in this game.\nThe AI will spam attacks constantly, and with the final boss this means no way to get in close to her. They each spam their specials and support, all of which have some way of being unstoppable. For example: There is a character who can deal 35% of your max health in one hit that has the range of the entire screen. There is another whose specials are all grabs that cannot be stopped mid-grab. The final boss' attacks are all at range, with the closest being just further than the melee-only character's heavy attack. The support lolis will stun you just long enough for the spamming AI to get a hit and stunlock you. This creates a fight that REQUIRES you to either button mash or spam your own move, both of which will fail unless you also get very lucky.\nThere is no balance whatsoever. As I stated above, there is a character with a max range attack that deals 35% of full health per hit, and has to be ducked to dodge. The final boss has the exact same attack, and so many attacks that can hit you no matter where you are that she can combo you in three hits to kill you right when the match starts. That character's AI will spam it quite often, locking you in place. The grab character will complete the grab whether you attack her halfway through or not. Any attack hitting her will just trigger it. The final boss will spam ranged attacks and her support to the point where even standing up is near impossible.\nThe following is what can be bypassed by vs mode.\nThe controls are the ultimate sin of this game's gameplay. The AI and unbalance could be bypassed if it were actually possible to play well. But the controls are set so that you have a light, middle, and heavy attack buttons, as well as a parry button and a support button. There is also a button that is literally set as the "no action" button. Meaning yes, there is a button that's sole purpose is to do nothing. This would be fine, except that hitting combinations of the light and middle attack buttons will trigger the parry, despite there being a button specifically for that. Given how difficult it is to avoid the AI's broken attacks long enough to actually attack, making a really easy mistake and wasting an opening with a parry will lose you the match very easily. Add to that how the controls for super moves and specials don't read quite right (though this could admittedly be my keyboard's fault) and the result is a necessity for spamming a single special move just to stand a chance of surviving.\nThe control explanations are useless, as they call the buttons A, B, C, and X, yet when setting controls it doesn't say which each button equates to. It simply tells you what the button does, but not if it's meant to serve as A, B, C, X, or anything else. In other words, using any special whatsoever requires a lot of trial and error just to figure out, and in the middle of being stunlocked by the AI, that's very difficult.\n\nIn the end, you'll end up finding a special for each character and just learning the timing for each character's standing up so you can spam it without them being able to get you into a stunlock yourself.\nHopefully this game will get a major overhaul and balancing, but unless it does, don't buy it unless it's on a really good sale.\nI really hate giving negative reviews to anything, but this game needed one. I'm sorry.","January 11, 2015","false","2.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Unfortunately, I couldn't, and for a multitude of reasons.\n\nFirst off, let me soften the blow with the positives. The game itself is VERY fun to play. See, I'm trying to look around and find some anime fighters to get into. Now, I know this is in no way similar to games like BlazBlue or Guilty Gear or any of those mainstream fighters, but y'know, I was more than willing to try this out, and when I did play it, I genuinely enjoyed it. The game style is simplistic, but hard to master, and I respect fighters like that. Kind of reminds me of old school fighters where you aren't necessarily trying to be combo heavy (Like... Samurai Showdown, for a good example), and I like that, considering I played the grappler character Lilith. The game looks REAL good for an anime game, but I don't particularly care for graphics in ANY game. All in all, the game is good.\n\nNow, let's talk about the faults. No, there are no faults in the gameplay or anything like that, the faults come into some of the things that occur when trying to set up the game. First off, this has very specific controller support, from what I read. I use a Rock Candy  Xbox360 controller for all of my controller support games, one in example being Skullgirls, which is another fighter I play on here. I've tried setting it up in the menu and everything, no dice. To play with said controller, I had to download some sort of program that allowed my controller to do what I want by setting each button and direction to a certain direction. This took me about.... 20 minutes to set it up alone and tweak it to a comfortable level. Next up, full screen for this game isn't truly full screen... You can put it in fullscreen, but it's just a fullscreen version of the windowed version of the game, meaning that you can still see the menu options that appear when it's on windowed on fullscreen, and again, this wouldn't be much of a problem if the ratio for it all wasn't something like 640x480, which makes it look... Weird in fullscreen. You're better off maximizing the window if you want the screen that big. I'm not going to insult the fact that there's no netplay for this, because there *kinda* is, which requires you to download a certain program which I have had no wish in wanting to try.\n\nThis game is fun, it really is, and I love anime girls as much as the next guy (especially THESE ones.... Too bad the one I play is the loli character), but breaking it all down, the thing that destroys it all is trying to set this all up. If you have a Xbox 360 controller, go play Skullgirls or something else, because it's gonna be a pain in the neck for you to try and set up. Gameplay wise, I give this game an 8/10, this is definitely a cool game, from the animations to the different play styles, but as a Steam Game (meaning is it worth buying and everything), I'd have to give it a... 4/10. It pains me to say that because the game is definitely a fun experience, but still... I got it on sale for $2.49, and in the end, I feel it was a big waste of money.. Sorry, Vanguard Princess, I loves ya, however, there were too many faults to prevent me from enjoying you for more than the hour I played.","January 10, 2015","false","1.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Many characters' movesets aren't fully defined, input errors are easy and frustrating to make, and hitboxes feel wonky.  There's a lack of well-defined controls so you just have to "wing it" often. The assist option is unimpressive and feels forced to add something different beyond very simple movesets and no intricate neutral game.  Even the story is bad, and we're talking about *fighting game stories* to compare.\n\nThat's mechanics. Now let's talk interface.  Sweet lord, the interface. If you don't play this in windowed mode, may the powers that be grant you mercy. Lazy input lag added to the feeling that this was rushed out half-baked.  I've played emulated games more responsive. No excuses for it being a one-man dev team -- ZUN has been running Touhou for years as a solo artist, and his games function perfectly fine (even if they were programmed drunk).\n\nOh, and the only point of the DLC is to add panty shots.  No revamped movesets or frame data updates, no adjustments to user feedback. Just panty shots.  I'm glad the dev knows what's important in his game.\n\nI got it free in a Humble Bundle, so I thankfully didn't throw a bunch of money at it.  Go play anything else.

It's not even funny. I went through hell trying to complete the game on the easiest difficulty.\n\nThe in-game help was completely useless. If you input the exact combination that they tell you to, it doesn't work. Simple as that. I spent a considerable amount of my overall playtime just figuring out how to get the combos to work. BEST OF ALL, the combinations are only shown at the character select screen. Nice UX design. After searching through forums and wikis I figured that a handful of the inputs were probably impossible with my keyboard.\n\nI especially love the boss fight. What I like to do is stand at the far left of the screen and watch my character get barraged with explosion after laser beam after assist after another assist after another assist followed by more laser beams and explosions, rinse and repeat. Until I die. Again and again. The more I actually tried defeating hilda rize, the more keys on my keyboard started flying out. I obviously stopped playing after this... only to try the entire 7 or 8 levels of arcade mode again with another character to find a similar result.\n\nIt's like they weren't even trying to make this game PC optimised and user friendly. The keyboard support from what I experienced was basically non-existent. Sure, I can discover some spammable sure win moves to get through the first 6 or so stages, but that hilda rize isn't going anywhere.

Instead it is only found in the character select of the Arcade Mode. The problem with this is that if players want to learn how to fight with a certain character, they either keep revisiting the Arcade Mode character select screen or printout a sheet of that character's moveset.\nI should not have to do this. NONE of the people playing this game should have to do this.\nPlease move the movelist into the pause screen.\n2) There is no Training Mode. Or I have absolutely no idea how to access it. The controller manual on the Pause Screen tells me that R2 is to control the training dummy, so I assume there is a training mode for this game.\n3) The support characters that follow the player are certainly an interesting feature. However, I feel like they can play a bigger role in the game, such as switching out with the primary character. The fan-made "Fate/Stay Night" fighting game, "CRUCIS+FATAL FAKE," despite being very clunky and a bit graphically off-putting, does a great job in having the support character come out and fight in the primary character's place.\nYou really can't call your fighting game "2 on 2" if only the primary character is in the fray.\nThis 3rd point is just my opinion. I'm sure the support characters can still be useful just the way that they are.\n4) No fullscreen. Very few people like windowed views.\n\nOther than that, it's not a bad game, but not a great game. A meh\n\n*BUGS*\n- Whenever I exit the character screen 3 times, my controller stops working\n\n*WARNING*\nBuy a controller for this game!

It's not even funny. I went through hell trying to complete the game on the easiest difficulty.\n\nThe in-game help was completely useless. If you input the exact combination that they tell you to, it doesn't work. Simple as that. I spent a considerable amount of my overall playtime just figuring out how to get the combos to work. BEST OF ALL, the combinations are only shown at the character select screen. Nice UX design. After searching through forums and wikis I figured that a handful of the inputs were probably impossible with my keyboard.\n\nI especially love the boss fight. What I like to do is stand at the far left of the screen and watch my character get barraged with explosion after laser beam after assist after another assist after another assist followed by more laser beams and explosions, rinse and repeat. Until I die. Again and again. The more I actually tried defeating hilda rize, the more keys on my keyboard started flying out. I obviously stopped playing after this... only to try the entire 7 or 8 levels of arcade mode again with another character to find a similar result.\n\nIt's like they weren't even trying to make this game PC optimised and user friendly. The keyboard support from what I experienced was basically non-existent. Sure, I can discover some spammable sure win moves to get through the first 6 or so stages, but that hilda rize isn't going anywhere. What is this, a Gameboy Advance game?\n\n> "Not user friendly"\nHaha there is no back button\nTutorial only shown at character select screen\nWhere is my steam overlay\nCannot quit arcade mode without closing the window\n\nOverall what I can say is that I got tricked into buying this solely by the visuals and the thought of "Oh, I haven't played a fighting game in a while!"

You'd be better off buying Skullgirls, which is simmilar to VP, but much better done and has a lot more content, or BlazBlue, which is another 2D fighter with no online play, but at least it offers a deep, convoluted story and characters with a lot of personality.\n\nEDIT: Apparently, there is a practice mode, but it has to be activated by a sceond player. That makes no sense. Also, the "practice mode" means the 2nd player can still control the character, and your life doesn't replenish, so you can both win the round. Even though the won round couter does not display how many turns you won, it is still saved, so when you win the second round you go back to character select. Also, the practice mode has to be turned on EVERY turn. This is inexcusable.","June 28, 2015","false","2.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The sprites are detailed, and the animations are fan-freaking-tastic. The music is catchy, the level design is bright(er than it should be sometimes), and all the flashy garnish you'd expect from such a heavily anime'd (probably not a word) title is most certainly present.\nThere's an attempt at a story, though I didn't really care too much about it, cutscenes used here and there, and the endings were a bit odd, but all nice to look at (animated victory screens etc).\nUnfortunately, the gameplay is where it falls flat. Moves lists are short (and way too many are shared across multiple characters), combos are boring, and wins just don't feel that rewarding. It features the usual mega-cheese-boss from fighting games of yesteryears, but that isn't really a good thing.\nNo proper practice mode, nor in game moves list can be a pain for fighting game nubs, but doesn't really hold seasoned fighting game players back much (or I don't feel it should). The one gripe I truly had was the total lack of explaining what the heck my teammate was supposed to do (and / or how to get them to do anything reliably).\nIt hurts me in a strange way to say it (because I really do love the loveable bits of this game) As a long time, and I mean LONG time (like 25 years long) fighting game player, I can't recommend this title.","February 16","false","0.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I've laughed at schlock like Karnov's Revenge and World Heroes, I've nearly dozed off with Divekick, but only Vanguard Princess has sucked out all of the joy from a 2D fighter and just ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off.\n\nStarting at the title screen, there's only two options: Story Mode and Versus. The lack of a Training Mode is really disappointing, and while the character select screen shows the movelist of each character, not being able to tool around with combos or just figure out the characters before jumping into a match isn't cool. There's no online play, and even if there was, I wouldn't have much faith in a doujin title having good netcode anyway, so I suppose I can't be too offended. The main deal here is that the game is naturally in windowed mode and still shows the toolbar, which is where the actual options are located. There's barely anything to tweak besides the controls (not even sound), and that also leads to a major caveat of the game. While the buttons can be configured simply enough with a very Visual Basic-esque window, the movement options are greyed out if you are configuring a controller or arcade stick. This is because the movement is permanently mapped to an analog stick, so a DPad or even an arcade stick won't work. Both of these options are infinitely preferable to using the analog stick, and Vanguard Princess doesn't give them to you.\n\nYou select two characters in this game; a generic, uninspired main anime girl and a loli assist. Getting into a match, the game has three basic attack buttons, a deflect button and a button to spam your assist, who is always on screen following your character around. While the game looks anime as hell (and it sure is animated well), the game isn't very combo friendly like an anime fighter. Actual combat comes off as either mashing buttons and seeing what normals connect, or spamming specials mindlessly. While this might sound surprisingly reminiscent of classic fighting games from the early 90s, it feels far more braindead and like it requires little to no strategy. It's also hard to concentrate on since the screen is absolutely cluttered with characters, including the two main fighters, both assist characters, and lots of characters in the stage background that tend to blend in the action.\n\nWhat's left is a basic, spammy, braindead 2D fighter that's a mess to look at and not very much fun at all, while also completely lacking in options and modes. I'm still just completely baffled that I can't use my arcade stick, but I don't suppose the game is worth it anyway.\n\nToo bad weeaboos desperate for anything anime-themed on Steam will buy this garbage anyway, though.","March 3, 2014","false","1.9"," 29 of 60 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","29","60","0","11"

Unlikely.\n\nTL;DR: Vanguard Princess is a beautifully animated with generally solid fighting mechanics at it's core, but with a feature list that can can be counted on one hand built in a inexcusably shoddy program environment for PC, it is a game that only the most ardent anime/moe/kawaii otaku's and die-hard fighter gamers should dare even bother with.\n\n-=Presentation=-\nIf at first glance, you saw this and thought this was a game mostly built to appeal to pervy anime fans, you'd mostly be right. That's only a problem depending what type of person you are, but at the get go, it limits it's appeal to only those type of gamers and then it's a core fighter which some of those types are not intreseted. The minute you open the game, it loads in a window, much like some early-to-mid 90's PC game or exported title from Japan (well, that's basically what it is). You can go to full screen with the Menu Bar (when's the last time you had to use that for a game?!) or Alt + Enter, but there are no resolution or aspect ratio options. What's worse, the application window can be freely scaled with no way to constrain it to an aspect ratio, so you can end up stretching the visuals too wide or too tall (or not enough of either) if you aren't perfectly dragging the window out to the correct size. This also almost defeats the purpose of the pixel based art style since it won't scale properly due to a lack of scaling options or anti-aliasing/smoothing - play full screen and you'd practically be able to count the pixels on the sprites.\n\nIt's an absolute shame too, because the animation is some of the most fluid and well animated sprites I've ever seen in a fighter (admittedly, I haven't played many "newer" anime fighters to compare this too like BlazBlue, Guilty Gear, or SkullGirls). It's clear that a vast majority of the time and resources (and not money, since this was originally a freeware title, unless money was spent) was built into the fighters and friends. Cloth flows, hair sways, boobs bounce...though this is all directly animated sprites. Most characters are wearing skimpy, revealing, or otherwise shapely garments, most especially the "loli" friends some of which that have clearly revealing and unrealistic "PLEASE LOOK AT MY CLEAVAGE" attire - this will immediately disturb and drive people away who aren't comfortable with this. It's doesn't bother me enough to not play the game at all, but I do feel weird playing this when relatives are walking by.\n\nSound is solid. The music is good, and is standard anime fare. I don't remember any track annoying me or sounding too amateur-ish.  Character speech is all Japanese voice acted - which is perfect for the "I only watch anime with subs" crowd that fawn over Japanese voice acting, everybody else will be either disappointed, annoyed, disgusted or a combination of all. That said I've seen no problems in terms of bad audio quality, glitches, cut offs or weirdness (like music getting stuck or not playing where it should. Though I've only played less than an hour's worth)\n\nHowever, the game as a whole being presented to you as a game and a PC game is god awful. No resolution or aspect ratio options. (You can only change key input and full screen vs windowed in the menu bar) No in game options screen. No online multiplayer (excusable since this was a free/cheap game). Broken training/practice feature. No tutorial or learning feature. Only two main menu options, Tiny bars for the special and assist meters (which are really bad in a fighter when you need this info and have to look in the corner away from the action). No pause menu. No audio options. An absolute mess. It is sometimes hard to believe this is a game that is being sold for money - thankfully this came as part of a bundle for me)\n\n-=Gameplay=-\nI can't give a proper review of the combat mechanics. There is a weak, strong, medium and assist attack. There are various moves that some can knock enemies into the air, allowing for some mild juggling (nothing like Tekken though). It's tough for me to get a grasp of how specials, assists and combos work, since there's not a true practice system in the game. You can go to Vs mode (the only other item to select in the main menu. Are you kidding me?) and after fumbling with the character select for the 2nd player, you can set the 2nd player into a practice mode where she keeps regaining health. You have to do  this clunkily by pressing the button assigned to Right Bumper/No Action (Why cant this be in a start menu like EVERY OTHER FIGHTER?!) and even with that mode, the time still runs out.\n\nIt's strange, I had no problem adjusting to Gundam Wing: Endless Duel on an SNES emulator with a third party gamepad on PC (and playing it quite well and being able to beat it reasonably), yet I can barely get by (and not beat the 3rd enemy) on a title built on the ground up from PC. It seems like I can't always get the moves I want to activate and it's even stranger when some characters have moves that apply to all attack buttons and others don't. Unfortunately, I have no way to learn this other than to study the moves list that appears ONLY when you select a character. Nothing in the pause menu...oh wait - there is no pause menu - it's just a screen that shows a picture of preset button inputs (that means it won't change when you change your keys) and somehow doesn't work properly when a battle starts, showing a screen saying "Oops, you need to Press Start" which doesn't always clear when you do. Oh, and the pause menu is defaulted to right thumbstick by default. Some of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥, unpopular 90s fighters did a less sloppy job with their menus than this game.\n\nRegardless, I had a hard time learning how to play the game. I did get a little better at one point, and had there been better systems in this game, I could see myself playing this a little bit longer just to see how good I can get (As I'm relatively Decent on PS3 SFIV and pretty darn good at Dreamcast/Arcade CVS2). I would enjoy this game more if I simply could "Suck less" and if I was more patient with it, could maybe become a decent player. I hopelessly suck at it, and I have no reason to deal with that when there are better fighting games to play.\n\n-=Summary=-\nIf fighters are among your primary genre and you enjoy the clearly hentai-esque vibe, then you may find an enjoyable fighter if you are willing to put up with one of the most awful PC gaming experiences I've ever dealt with. If you don't have a high standard for what to expect from PC game and you consider yourself part of the "Japanime" ethos, than you may tolerate this game. You may be able to live with the problems and even expect it since the game is $5 or less on sale/bundles - but neither I nor most gamers need waste their time with this when there are better options (unless you're desperate for a cheap/free fighter).\n\nSteam user duvel wrote a reasonable interpretation of the game that tells you what you need to know, though with 66% helpful rating due to likely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ off the fanbase. Vanguard Princess is clearly targeted a very niche market.","May 9, 2014","false","1.8"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

All the options which there is very little of can be changed using the menu bar. If you are playing in full screen, you have to switch to between display modes. Even the full screen mode does not work properly as it only display in a larger window. Controller support is functional but lacks digital pad support.\n\nThere are only two modes for Vanguard Princess, Story and Versus...that's it. There is no proper training mode, challenges or online play. The game only offer the bare minimum. I can only recommend to those who plan to play local. Other players are better off with something like Skullgirls.\n\nVargaurd Princess is a freeware game in Japan and it is very evident. Considering the game is being sold outside Japan, I would expect more polish. It is a shame because Varguard Princess is a good fighter but it lacks the standard functionality a paid product should have. I cannot really give it a recommendation without an exception which is reserved for the local play. For everyone else, there are better fighters to choose from even if you have to risk the higher price.\n\nJust because a free game is an import does not automatically warrant a price on it but that is clearly what happened with Vangaurd Princess. The developer seized the opportunity to gain profit by lazily releasing a freeware game. If want to know how to transfer a freeware title to a full paid product, just look at Cave Story which not only added new modes but also had an overhaul in graphics and sound. Vanguard Princess has no additions to warrant a price it.","July 22, 2014","false","1.9"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","1"

There is no way to change the resolution or any other option. You can simply switch to either a micro-sized window, an increased size window with the menu bars up top, or full screen.

Missing a lot of modes. Its just story and VS with controller support but not tuned for it.\n\nSome of the fighters feel a little inbalanced but if you have a good partner, it can make up for the weaknesses. Unfortunately the game doesn't tell you what each does or if it is going to be a good companion fighter. Some of them are easier to use than others. Honestly its a nice touch that makes it more than just a 2D fighter, but it makes the fights a little more complicated than it needs to be. You can often forget your partner is there.\n\nThere are 3 difficulties but they don't feel very different from each other. The AI also will suddenly go on a nonstop spree in any of the modes which can be a problem if your fighter isn't one that can defend against cqc attacks as well. Overall the difficulty isn't very balanced. You'll likely spend time hitting yes to continue until the AI one of the times decides not to go into OP mode.\n\nAt the end of the day, this'll just be a Trading Cards game. Take it for what it is.

Also, once you learn how to get the most out of the game by using some of the hidden functions like activate training mode, change the game file to get a better resolution by default, and how to setup online versus play work around, Vanguard Princess will become more worth it. The true downside to this game is that developers suck and don't really care about the game. They basically just took the freeware version cleaned up the menus a little bit and just tried to sell it. The don't care about the game or the community at all and they never have. The don't know anything about fighting games and they flat out suck! I will never support their future projects.

I rarely write reviews but I am so frustrated that I have to so here goes... (In order of how I discovered things) and I will mention I use a PlayStation controller with the program DS3 Tool to emulate an Xbox controller but I will use Xbox terms just keep in mind the position of the Left Joy Stick and D-Pad.\n\nI looked at the art of this game and was rather thrilled, it looked fun, I enjoy fighting games and an anime style fighting game excited me, just like Skullgirls (which a enjoy very much, despite my amazing ability of completly sucking at it) What I did not know when buying this game was how much it lacked...\n\nI installed the game, started it up, first thing I noticed, windowed mode, okay, time to full screen... nope just leave it windowed, in full screen you have the same window just surrounded by an enormous black border which is just ugly especially on bigger screens like my 32in monitor. So I stayed in windowed mode.\n\nNext I'm using an Xbox controller... A is usually confirm while B is usually back... nope every button seems to be confirm and within 30 seconds of starting the game I was in a fight.. I didnt even get to look at the roster "sad face" or see other options or modes for that matter.\n\nOkay, so now I'm in a fight with a character fighting another character whose names I don't even know because "Oh right, I didnt get to see the roster" the opponet is the same fighter great, which one is me? "Ummmmmm push the same button and watch which one repeats the same move?!" Yeah lets do that. okay so I figure out which character is mine and I lost track of her a lot.\n\nOkay so now I have a general idea of who my fighter is now I'm trying to combo, nope, apparently not... yaaaaay button mashing... I started pushing the same button "A" to do a low kick the whole time... in the process I decided to diddle on Tumblr and message a few friends on my phone in the process... Oh hey I'm winning... now I focus on the game after I'm done on my phone... Oh hey I'm losing, pfft Sad I do better when I'm not paying attention, at the same time I couldn't tell if I was winning or losing since I didn't know who I was...\n\nNow I discover that the D-pad don't move me, but the Joy Stick... okay that's weird for a fighting game, usually I can use either, and I prefer the D-pad... guess that's not happening!\n\nBy this time I am frustrated so I press Start, apparently that means Quit: Yes or No? by this time I understand that the Left Stick moves the cursor too... so stop for a second and check out the little Windows Bar at the top and discover that's how you change stage and all the other options (like button mapping which still didn't tell me what the buttons did) instead of it being in the game. Going on, I select "No"\n\nI discovered only two game modes, Arcade and a Local Versus, not even a tutorial.\n\nThis game feels like something that could be described as "Pre-Alpha" in yet it isn't even Early Access\n\nSo please keep in mind 4 minutes of game time when I posted this and I wrote this, I feel like most of the "Positive Reviews" is just sarcasm, when there is so many better fighting games. (By the way Steam told me I had to play for at least 5 minutes so I started the game back up for 60 seconds just to post this review).\n\nThis game will now gather virtual dust in my Steam Library.\n\nTo the developers, I'm sorry if I seem very bashful. You made something I probably couldn't, not from scratch anyways, and if this is a first attempt, you have the basic mechanics down and you deserve props. But compared to games like Tekken, Dragonball Z, Street Fighter, Soul Caliber, Dead or Alive, and many others.... this severely lacks. I hope it gets some huge greatly needed updates. And right now frankly I want my money back especially cause I bought the Vanguard Princess Lilith DLC too expecting high hopes.","December 28, 2014","false","3.6"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

It wasn't a highlight of the bundle, but when it came over to Steam, I thought I'd give it a shot.\n\nVanguard Princess is a very pretty game, certainly, but suffers from several UI and gameplay issues that really keep me from recommending it. I don't mind the fanservice in it, but that's really the main focus of the game from what it seems. The art style seems to have taken precedence of deeper movesets, online netcode, and several other features that would have made this more than just a basic Freeware game.\n\nButtons are difficult to figure out and somewhat of a pain to change. From my short time playing it, I noticed that some of the move commands listed in the game are different than what they actually are on the gamepad. Several of them rely on awkward finger positioning, and changing the buttons requires going into the software menu int he Windows bar; there are no in-game settings for that. Which, speaking of, if you Fullscreen the game, you lose access to that button.\n\nThere's no online play from what I saw. You do get a Versus mode to play with friends, but it requires a second player. If you want to play dead bots, you have to figure out the 2P buttons on a keyboard or controller to input your selections. There is no AI Practice Mode. Also, in the Versus mode, your movesets are not listed in any of the menus, and the "Quit Match" command doesn't seem to register on the keypad, so you have to Alt+F4 out of it or figure other ways to leave.\n\nThere are shadows of a good fighting game in here, but it is way, way underdeveloped to really recommend paying any money for. As it is, there's really nothing to enjoy unless you just really want to see cartoon underwear. Or, if you got it in a bundle, you can probably sell the Steam cards for more than the game costs.","March 18, 2014","false","1.9"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

There are good mechanics here, and the sprite work is top notch, but...\n\nThe game's controls are counter intuitive.  On the keyboard, the arrow keys are not the default movement for Player 1.  Instead it's T, F, H, and B, which are not only a bit spaced out, but too close to the attack keys.  Using an Xbox 360 controler is also a pain, requiring you to completly rework the default controls.  Hell, by default, there's not a single button that will pause the game.  Not to mention you need third party software to even use the D-Pad (or a PS3 controller, which many recommend).  Also, it dose not bode well if the most effective tactic is button mashing (at least on a keyboard).\n\nUPDATE: I tried using a Hori brand arcade stick (the one included with Tekken 6), and though the buttons worked, the joystick would not.  And before you ask, YES I did test it on another game (AVGN Adventures), and can confirm that the joystick works just fine, meaning that it's the same issue as the D-pad.\n\nAnother problem is the difficulty.  I've played many hard fighting games before, but a good chunk of the time I can't even beat the first opponent on Story Mode, ON EASY!  This game is unforgiving to anyone new to the game, and will kick your ♥♥♥ unless you learn how to use your character, or just get by by dumb luck.\n\nThere's also no apparent VS CPU mode in the game, or even a training mode to help you practice (which it could really use).  It also dosen't help that the only way to get to the game's options is when it's in windowed mode.  In full screen mode, you cannot access the game's options, making it very hard to even quit the game at times (first time playing this on full screen, the only way I could quit the game was to use ctrl+alt+delete).\n\nI also want to bring up the graphics.  I have a high resolution screen, and the games speed is good, but the graphics look like I'm playing it on an early PS1 or Saturn at times (if not just a step below that).  It may be just my system, or it could be that the game isn't optimized for high resolution screens.  Until I can confirm what the problem is, I have to say it's a "results may vary" situation here.\n\nUPDATE: Reading other reviews, it is indeed a resolution issue.  Not game breaking, but it will hurt the game for some players.\n\nThe lack of a net code dose hurt it a bit, but this is a problem being work on, so I cannot fault the game for that, not to mention that don't play games like this online enough for it to be a real problem for me.\n\nCompared to games like Skullgirls, BlazBlue, or Arcana Heart, there is some good mechanics, but the interface, controls, and difficulty in it's current form makes this hard for me to reccomend.  Should these things be fixed, I would say it's worth the $5, but as it is, I say wait until the game is patched to fix these problems.

If even half of these are implamented then I feel that the game would become at least 10x better.  Also by makeing some improvements I feel that you could of made a better indiegogo campaign (which I missed)\n\n1) my first problem is that to view all options you'd have to be in window screen instead of full screen mode to to view the "Windows, Options, and Help" tab.  They should be place as part of the main menu screen.  Along with being able to acess them when you pause the game.\n\n2) the whole press "start+a+b+x+y" to quit needs to be replace with a quit the game to a simple pause menu (like stated before) with a selectable option to end the game.\n\n3) The main menu screen should have a training room/practice mode instead of haveing to puase the game and do it manually.\n\n4) a suggestion for the "Directors cut "DLC how about including something like directors cut at the title screen\n\n5) It needs a move list that you can bring up during a match to see all of your characters moves.\n\n6) the keyboard controlls, what where you thinking.  I know that we can rebind the keys but come on those default controlls are rediculous.  I'm glade that I use a 360 controller.\n\n\noverall I rate this game a 6/10 but needs a lot of improvements to hardness a larger fanbase like SkullGirls.","June 3, 2014","true","4.7"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

No options for graphics, sound. Need to use f buttons to chage screen size, that's not explained.  Controller barely works, as can't go back or go to options, or back to start menu. Sometimes pausing doesn't even work. As for the game. There is no tutorial or any explanation of any mechanic or part of the game. Seems impossible to do any moves, as the few next to people  seem overly convoluted and the button combos aren't even explained nor what the symbols for button means. There is no way to check command list. Basically just button mash. Blocking isn't explained either. The screen is super busy and it is hard to tell what is going on 2/3 of the time, whether you are winning or losing. Backgrounds and evironments are dull and look like they are from 1980, with no detail or anything going on with them. There is a support character, but once again how to use them, any possible combos, when they are charged, what they can do, none of it is explained. One time I did a special move but I have no idea how or why. The story is basically non-existant, worse than most fighting games, and if you accidentally press any button it skips it all. There is no online multiplayer, so why does this even exist. There is story, practice, and duel, and that's it. I have played many fighting games, MK, Tekken, Injustice, MVC 2, and this is the worst fighting game I have ever played. But the game does have plenty of giant anime t!ts and panty shots, per usual.

It makes it somewhat annoying to have to go into the arcade mode or the non-existant versus mode to be able to get familiar with a character and how she works (Multiplayer seems to be local only, which in this day and age, is a big no-no for any fighting game). The controls can be customized, of course, so the awkward controls can be fixed, but the interface for it could stand to be adjusted so you can tell what button is being mapped to where.\n\nThis game also lacks the Steam interface, so people can't really take screenshots and show them to friends, but if anyone wants to see what the game looks like, the store page does a fine job of that.\n\nSo one of the bigger deal breakers for me with this game was the obvious lack of online multiplayer. I'm not someone who enjoys playing VS the AI over and over, and I certainly don't play them for the "deep" story, multiplayer is always the main selling point for me in a fighting game, because for me that is where the fun is at. I believe you CAN play this game in multiplayer, but you have to work for it, which just doesn't seem worth it to me with how many steps are involved, and the fact that this game would have no servers should you go through with it.\n\nThat said, the game is fairly pretty to look at, the girls are very cute, and the movesets are pretty interesting and fun. The game has an assist system, which is a bit reminiscent of Marvel vs Capcom 1, only your assist doesn't run out. It has nice voice acting, and some nice stages, and the artwork is great so it has that going for it.\n\nPersonally for $5 (lower during sales, of course), it's certainly not a bad deal if you don't mind just playing through story mode and ogling pretty girls, but I just can't recommend this without a proper training mode or online multiplayer. It certainly does have some huge potential to be a great fighting game, however.","January 24, 2015","false","1.9"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","25","1","4","2","2"
