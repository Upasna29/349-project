What about the original Half-Life or Unreal?  Did you ever wonder who the heck's gonna clean up after these heroes?\n\nThe answer has finally been provided by the developers of VCD, and the answer --- is you.\n\nThere is no story.  There is you.  There is a mop.  There is a bucket of water.  You have no idea who is responsible for the carnage; you only know it's your task to clean up after it.\n\nFor such a strange idea for a game, the developers have really outdone themselves in my opinion.  They have taken an idea that likely only tugs at the corner of the minds of .01% of the total FPS-gaming population and made a game out of it.  They've made a game that seems incredibly boring actually fun.\n\nAs a Janitor for the Viscera Cleanup Detail company, each facility you visit must be painstakingly mopped; all the trash must be picked up; and all the body parts must be incinerated.  How you complete this task is up to you, but that facility had better be spotless when your supervisors arrive, or you risk losing your job (and that's actually an Achievement).\n\nAfter completing a facility, you return to your "office," and can read reports on your progress.  These reports vary from employee commendations to tongue-in-cheek company newsletters, and really add to the experience.  You are also able to take "trophies" with you should you so choose by placing them in the blue trunk that you take with you to each job.\n\nPeople who don't enjoy ironic humor, or never played an FPS, should stay well away.  But if you love watching the gibs fly on any contemporary FPS game; or even enjoyed the pixelated trips down Memory Lane of DOOM or Duke Nukem 3D;  or even the bump-mapped polygons of Unreal and Half-Life, this is a must-have in your collection.  You already blew the place to smithereens; didn't you mom teach you pick up after yourself?","January 15, 2015","true","168.2"," 219 of 226 people (97%) found this review helpful 92 people found this review funny","97","219","226","92","0"

There's something seriously zen about mopping up the aftermath of all these 'incidents' and not having to worry about trying to stop them for once!  As a bonus, the devs have a great sense of humor which is sprinkled throughout the various notes and incident reports in each level.\n\nIf you're not into the whole zen thing, there's also a p sweet speedrun mode.  There's even character progression of sorts, in that your office is persistant and has its own secrets.\n\nMy only complaint is sometimes it's not obvious when my mop is saturated with gore due to colored lighting, but I could probably just pay more attention.\n\n9/10 A+ Would clean again","October 24, 2015","true","145.2"," 239 of 251 people (95%) found this review helpful 68 people found this review funny","95","239","251","68","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bucchus/recommended/246900/","bucchus","Bucchus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bucchus/","1045 products in account","This is an excellent co-op game with friends! The game first might seem like cheap youtuber bait that's fun physics for an hour, but actually it is a really solid game that I keep wanting to play again and again. It might not sound appealing (yeah you're cleaners and handymen and you have to do your boring job, no shooting), but I've yet to play a session that didn't have tons of laughter.\n\nIn theory, it could be described as an efficiency puzzle game. What is the best way to sort out this mess? Do you start collecting body parts first because they leak blood around? Do you start mopping the blood first so others don't leave more bloody footprints around? Do you start with the welder to fix bullet holes which will definitely cause some fires and leave messy scorch marks? What is the safest path to the incinerator? Which one of you put this stick of dynamite in my biohazard bin?\n\nIn reality though, it becomes this slapstick Laurel & Hardy simulator. Cue the Pat & Mat theme, you're carrying something explosive carefully to another part of the level for safe disposal, but on the way your friend is mopping the floors and walls while having his bucket full of bloody mess in the middle of the corridor. You fail to spot the bucket, trip over it, spilling the red muck all over the clean hall and then whatever you were carrying hits the wall, setting it off, at least causing a fire if not outright explosion. The mess gets hilariously worse, some of you probably die and you're laughing your asses off.\n\nThe workplace safety is atrocious here, you can trigger deadly defense turrets, switch on the gravity while your friend is floating 15 meters up, nudge your friend into a Sarlacc pit while he's cleaning near it, you can crank the company boombox volume so loud it will detonate nearby explosives with the bass. All of this would be terrible in an actual cleaning job, but here failure just creates more hilarity (and deaths). For added stupidity, I'd suggest trying out a control scheme you're not too familiar with, spilling buckets with the Steam controller's gyro was amusing.\n\nOn top of carrying brains, mopping blood and supplying vending machines and repairing machinery, you can be a detective by discovering clues and investigating the death scenes. What event took place here and killed everyone? Rogue AI? Bioterrorism? Madness-inducing artifact? For bonus points, in the post-level survey you can try to deduce the actual causes of death for each corpse. Was this guy eviscerated by an alien lifeform, but the other guy in the room actually shot himself before that?\n\nThe levels are really well designed, full of hidden details and endless nods towards movies. For example, there's a pretty accurate Event Horizon map, complete with toggleable gravity and an accident-prone airlock! There's even a sort of on-going plot throughout the game, one of your colleagues has gone crazy and has hidden clues over the levels, you're supposed to deduce where his hideout is located and how to get there.\n\nSome of the missions take just half an hour, the longest ones might take over three hours if you're really OCD and want to 100% clean every corner. It might work as a solo game for some, but it's definitely best in multiplayer, progress is quicker and there's more possibilities for funny mishaps with a crowd. Because this game isn't actually a shooter or just a walking simulator, it's something really unique and I would recommend everyone to at least try it if they have the chance, unless you can't handle blood and splatter comedy.\n\nFinishing a level is optional, it's even pretty funny to just pick a map and make more mess with the bucket physics so it ends up looking like the lawnmower scene from Braindead. But then again, just cleaning after a horrendous massacre so all that's left is shining chrome and polished corridors is oddly satisfying...","December 14, 2015","true","32.8"," 142 of 149 people (95%) found this review helpful 28 people found this review funny","95","142","149","28","0"

You've heard of first person shooter games?  Well, folks, this is a first person cleaner game; the shooting has happened, the world is saved, and you are the janitorial staff tasked with cleanup.   I have never hated saviors of mankind as much as I have while picking up their discarded ammo casings and fixing bullet holes in the walls.\n\nReasons why it's great for co-op:\n\n1.  The satisfaction you and your friends get when seeing actual progress in transforming the unique environment of the game you're playing.  Seriously, this sounds weird, but we feel great seeing what we had to work with and what we made it into.  I never expected to enjoy playing the game as much as I did and I was shocked at how much fun the friends I gave my four pack to liked it.\n\n2.  Hearing them argue about the best methods to dispose of a body (record for blackmail later!).\n\n3.  Seeing them walk into a room, look up, and exclaim, "Oh god...HOW IS THAT EVEN POSSIBLE?!"\n\n\nEarly Access Tips:\n\nRemember, if you play the game now, it's not going to be at its best.  Early access means it's rough and there's definitely some code optimization and collision detection going on that can be frustrating (and sometimes funny as hell) to work with.\n\nWhen hosting a game, it's a direct connect type.  So make sure the person hosting has a pretty decent computer and a solid internet connection.  If you can't connect to their sever, they may need to setup port forwarding.  The ports used by this game are 7777 and 27015\n\nIf you get a "too many actors" error message on your server, it means there's too many unique items.  This can happen from tracking too many player bloody footprints around.  Happened a lot when we were doing a 4-man cleanup team.  To solve this, have someone get rid of all the ammo casings on the ground (pick up and drop in the incinerator) and the rest of the group should focus on getting a specific area of floor clean.  Of all blood and gore.   To prevent this from happening (until it gets fixed) try making little clear footpaths to all the necessary machines (incinerator & bucket maker).","July 20, 2014","true","19.0"," 91 of 95 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","91","95","0","1"

As a sandbox game it also does a good job of simulating worker boredom in a way that's far from boring for the player.  If anyone's ever done a really dull, manual job with no redeeming features, you'll sympathize with the Space Janitor as he scatters boxes, abuses the spot welder by melting random stuff, makes amusing piles of body parts, writes on the floor with the blood on his boots... all that good stuff.  When you're not incinerating things that don't belong to you and treading blood into the carpet, you can also steal stuff via your special Janitor's Trunk.  For every Rambo and Ripley out there, you'll find an army of long-suffering Space Janitors armed with nothing more deadly than a mop, rolling their eyes and tutting as they get down to the real work.  Go on, give them a hand.  They need all the help they can get.","May 16, 2015","true","42.4"," 74 of 79 people (94%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","94","74","79","21","1"

From a premise so insanely simple comes one of the most interesting, gloriously monotonous games I have ever had the fortune to play.\n\nAs a space-station janitor, your life is a thankless one.

So what makes this game so awesome to play?\n\nThis is a game for the people who want something to play, but don't want to work their mind too much... This is a game in which you can watch a TV show, listen to a podcast or some excellent music whilst you play. Many hours have been spent catching up on podcasts and cleaning away to my hearts content.\n\nWhile it is indeed early access, that should by no means put any potential buyers off, as it is frequently updated with new maps, janitorial tools and in the near future, workshop support, meaning that a multitude of mods will no doubt arrive to spice up the game even further!\n\nIn summation, this is an early access game that does it right, in a sea of so many underwhelming titles.

Based solely on the fact that you cannot meander about doing a bit of one thing, and a bit of another; You have to have a strategy on the order in which you do things. You can, and will spend an hour or two on one level- if you let yourself go that far.\n\n"This sounds like a commitment." I hear you say, and yes! It is- and it has to be one that you find enjoyable in order to truly appreciate the subtle fun that this game has to offer.\n\n*This game is fun, because it offers a challenge that current games lack: Self management, and to an extent- self control.\n\nYou will not have some computerized message on-screen to tell you: "Pick up the body parts first" or "Mop a path to the incinerator and bucket dispenser in order to minimize bloody footprints" you learn these things as you go, and you have to be willing to experiment, and keep an open mind in order to succeed.\n\nSo, on a closing note- if you like experimenting with processes, as well as organizing yourself in a productive manner- then congratulations! You'll likely enjoy this game a lot!\n\nIf you're more the sort who likes to make a mess of things, and loves playing with body parts, and spilling buckets of blood everywhere, then you'll still like the game, but you'll likely get bored of it quicker, and lose friends over playing hockey with an intestine.","October 31, 2014","true","32.4"," 52 of 54 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","52","54","0","0"

Have you been thinking, "Man, I need to clean this up?"  Then this is the ultimate procrasinator for you.\n\nThe obsessive-compulsive be warned, this is a game that will finally end the horror of opening and closing the fridge door 7 times in a row, but never ease the time commitment.  Why?  Because you'll develope a new tick:  Cleaning up video game slaughter using only a handful of janitor's tools.  Imagine cleaning the corridors of a DOOM game days after the hero has left?  Imagine cleaning a museums of artifacts held by an evil private collector after a fatal gang shooting?\n\nThe player enters a game with a mop, bucket, trash can, and incinerator for body parts and other subversive materials.  If the player is careful, all can be cleaned up fairly quickly.  If the player is not careful, he could create his own mess.\n\nPro-Tip: don't spill buckets of blood and don't drop body parts.  Blood gets into carpets.\n\nThere is something very satisfying about this game.  It appeals to the sense of accomplishment.  We all feel down now and then, and this game hits on that nerve.  We're offered the afrtermath of a slaughter and need to clean it up.  And when we do clean it up, we get this great sense of accomplishment, eventhough only virtually.  It's silly, but one of the best things you can do when depressed is scrub your toilet.  It sounds silly, but it makes a person feel as if they have accomplished and done something good or great.  It offers a sense of cleanliness and goodness.\n\nThis game does the same.\n\nUnless you play muliplayer.  Then this game turns into a vindictive bloodbath after someone bonks into another player and blood is spilled...and tracked all over that floor I just cleaned!  This game can be a Cinderalla's nightmare.\n\nIs it fun?  No.  But it is rewarding.  It is the gold star you never got in 3rd grade.  It is the redemption you deserve for cleaaning your friend's vomit at a party.  It excuses that one time you ♥♥♥♥ your pants.

Those of you who've played the gory games like Dead Space, Resident Evil, Silent Hill, will maybe have once joked that you don't envy whoever has to clean the mess up that you, in those games, makes.\n\nTurns out that is EXACTLY the case in VCD. YOU are the shmuck who got sent to the blood-drenched space station AFTER the Bald McAngry Spacemarine protagonist of another adventure had passed through. YOU are the poor sod who has to pick up all the limbs, the guts, the organs, all of it. YOU are the janitorial staff hired to clean up after the incidents.\n\nThat is what makes it so oddly satisfying and brilliant all at once. There is no big bad enemy bosses, there is no universe to save, there is no multi-level demon destroying slaughter. There is only you, and the aftermath of the previous examples. Something had happened here, judging by the abundance of guts and trash and casings...but that isn't what you're paid to think about, really. You're cleaning up after the story has happened.\n\nThe levels are quite diverse, ranging from a trashy, smelly waste disposal area to an entire digsite or even a zero gravity chamber, all of them filled to the brim with things that need mopped up or incinerated or both. Some even have their own unique gimmick, such as the Sandtraps of Unearthly Excavation that can be fed items, though it may just regurgitate other items and cause further mess.\n\nThe game is somewhat passive aggressive in it's design. Your automated waterbucket dispenser can jam and sometimes spew out bodyparts, which can make a mess. Or your Biohazard Bin dispenser can spew out some gibs...which needs cleaned up as well. The game does it's best to let you know that your job is grisly. You will need to take bloody buckets to be incinerated, you will need more buckets to mop up a spilled bucket. You'll need bins to carry all that viscera to the incinerators too...but that might just make more mess if you spill any.\n\nIt becomes oddly satisfying to turn a gory scene entirely on it's head. Make everything nice again, put it together, organize boxes. Do well enough and you'll be promoted. Do even better and you'll get an Employee of the Month award! The 'feedback' given to you outside of Speedrun mode gives the game little snippets of flavor. If you do well, you'll receive a meaningless promotion with very minute and insignificant changes to your lifestyle, such as a 5% salary increase, or a slightly bigger locker. Of course, your colleagues begin to hate you for this, because then the company expects higher performance from them too. This has no real changes evident in gameplay, but you CAN collect multiple Employee of the Month awards to decorate your office with...\n\nAll in all, VCD is still Early Access but hell, if it can make a strangely tedious job like janitorial work satisfying in a weird way, money well spent.\n\nAlso if you see Bob, notify security immediately.","January 17, 2015","true","83.3"," 48 of 53 people (91%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","91","48","53","18","0"

(First Person Janitor).\n\nI wish I could tell you why this game is worth playing, why it's worth buying, but I myself still cannot comprehend why I enjoy this game.\n\nWhile playing it, there are moments of self observation in which I laugh at myself "I can't believe I'm playing a Janitor simulator, lol." but then I keep playing. There is something peaceful and calming about the game, cleaning up every bit of blood and gore is satisfying for some reason. I still cannot understand why.\n\nThere is merit in the fact that this game had my sister in law, a person who rarely plays video games, hooked on the game for 6 hours straight. How does a Janitor simulator DO THAT? What magic is this?!\n\nThe game is still in early access mode and as such, there are glitches. Don't expect everything to work perfectly. In order to enjoy this game, you MUST have the ability to laugh at yourself, and not take things too seriously. You will knock over buckets of blood, your waste bins will glitch out with dismembered, break dancing feet and throw all that trash you picked up everywhere. (this only happened to me once though!)\n\nI do appreciate it as a game though, there is a challenge and it is the challenge of patience and dexterity. This game is not full of inventory menus, you don't go up to an incinerator, click it and select which items go on like in Minecraft. This game operates on physics yo, and since that's case, you have to pick things up, orient them, carry and place them carefully wherever you need them.\n\nIt takes strategy, skill and patience to beat this.

As a space janitor assigned in the aftermath of a brutal conflict between humans and aliens, it's your job to get a mop, a bucket and a bin and go around tidying up.  That's it.  In practice, however, what you get is a massively compulsive and fulfilling experience.\n\nThere are a good handful of varied maps available, from simple maintenance tunnels to more advanced zero gravity setups onboard spaceships.  Each scenario can take anywhere from 45 minutes to a hefty 3-4 hours to comprehensively clean.  Using your mop, you'll rid the floors and walls of pools of blood and dirt, sweep up spent bullet casings and discarded litter with your brush, and deposit the mutilated remains of humans and aliens alike into your handy biohazard bin.  There is also a nifty tool called the "laser welder", which allows you to remove bullet holes from the environment.\n\nOnce you near the end of your janitorial duties, you can use the sniffer tool to help you find any small bits you might have missed.  It has two settings: one for detecting organic material, such as body parts, and the other for detecting inorganic material, like empty food containers and drinks cans.  When you're confident you've found everything, you can "punch out", whereupon you'll be greeted by a post-assignment screen informing you of your overall completion percentage.  If you're the OCD type, discovering you missed even a mere 0.5% can be devastating.\n\nI've found Viscera Cleanup Detail to be the perfect "chill out" experience.  There's something oddly satisfying and calming about moving slowly through an area, cleaning it as you go, knowing that you're edging closer and closer to returning it to a more presentable standard.\n\nNow if only these feelings translated into how I feel about real life housework.","December 31, 2015","true","12.8"," 32 of 32 people (100%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","100","32","32","5","0"

Starting some of the maps feel like you've been dropped into the middle of a pacific oil spill with a pack of tissues and a bucket of good intentions, but that just makes it all the more pleasing to see the level be transformed as you work away at it like the gameplay equivalent of trying to get a gobstopper to fit in your mouth comfortably by licking away at it until your tongue bleeds.\n\nThe graphics are surprisingly great, and there's more to it than just mopping up messes and carting out bodies. You get bonuses for repairing level specific objects and stacking things in the right loading areas, or by using a welding gun to melt an eldritch tentacle into a single cauterized blob for easy transport. (That is a real tactic)\nYou can really be very tactical/logical about the whole thing, and for some people - myself included - many hours of slow methodical not-quite-work is a wonderful way of spending the time.\n\nThe levels are all interesting and distinct; from the enemies to the colours used in the lighting.

They even give you a copy of UDK to do your own things, no messing around with loading packages, it all works right from the menu.\n\nOnly problem I can see with it is multiplayer isn't especially user-friendly - I've never been on a multiplayer server since the browser doesn't work too good.

When I first heard of it, I was like, "Wha?" No interest in cleaning within a video game. Who would be interested in that? It's boring, monotonous, and... just a waste of time. Then I got the Shadow Warrior level included with that game. Went, "Ehhh," and gave it a shot. Played through it twice in a row, eight hours over the course of two days. Holy crap, it was good. SO good that I HAD to buy the full game.\n\nWhy is it so good, you ask? It's the most unique game I've ever played. Almost hypnotic when it comes to starting the game, grabbing a bin and bucket, and just turning off your brain for a while. Listen to some music, maybe a fun or informative podcast, and hours disappear in a flash. And that sense of satisfaction you get when you clean an area perfectly? Earn an Employee of the Month award plaque? It's oddly amazing for something as tedious and downright repetitive as cleaning. But it's SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO good.\n\nAnd I didn't even get into its morbid sense humor. The way you find body parts everywhere, little notes from people who used to work in these facilities you're cleaning, and countless other tiny (and not so tiny) details lends itself to some of the most memorable humor I've seen in quite some time. To roam around and find the results of something gone horribly awry is strangely fascinating. And now it's up to you to clean it all up. Get to work already, ya slacker! *shaking fist*\n\nPlay this lovely, lovely game. Just play it. It is WAY too enjoyable to play in the most bizarre way possible, hence why I've already dumped 76 hours into it (with many, MANY more in the future, I promise). You may love it, or you find it pointless, but either way, I can almost guarantee that you'll never forget it. Two thumbs up. And then, most likely, on the floor somewhere amid a pile of bullet casings and alien goop.

There's a certain zen that comes from just sitting back and completing a task. It's similar to the satisfaction from making deliveries in Euro Truck Simulator.\n\nIn any case, one of the more interesting parts is simply exploring a giant level and seeing all the cool sci-fi crap sitting around. Some of these levels are beautiful, sans the blood and guts.\n\nMy only complaints would be that sometimes it's a bit vague whether the level is clean or not and the grading is very unforgiving (it hurts to do a full level for the first time, meticulously clean everything you think you need to clean and get a 76% rating). Once you read a bit and figure out all the crap you need to do, it's a little easier. It might ruin some of the magic of a first time playthrough though.\n\nIt's on special so I'd definitely pick it up. I'm sure it's a good laugh in co-op.

I want to clean up more and on even more varied stages. If only the creators had named their child The Space Janitor! Or something a little more catchy!\n\nThe pictures speak for themselves: as a janitor you need to clean up the leftovers of a huge massacre. Imagine your favourite horror movie or video game and that particular scene where a battle ensues between people and monsters or aliens and the ending result is a huge pile of body parts and pools of blood in every which way.\n\nThis is what Viscera presents you on different stages and this is what you're gonna spend hours and hours with in order to have everything cleaned up. Now, the game is not as easy as first seems: your mop quickly becomes dirty and the bucket of clean water eventually turns red. You go back to a machine to get more and the same goes for the containers that are used to collect trash and body parts.\n\nEventually, you drop everything into a huge incinerator and, if desired, you can even stack all the crates and barrels on the stage to one of its corners. Oh, and you also have secondary objectives such as plant some seeds or get rid of some nasty pit monsters. And in case you are interested to know what caused the massacre you can look for tablets or notes telling you the horrible tale behind each level! Finally, it all comes down to the work you have done: a perfectly tidied map that is spotless from beginning to end!\n\nAt this point the only downside of the game is its early access stage. Playing with somebody in multiplayer requires the IP address and even then connecting is a bit difficult.

It is legit fun and I cannot fully explain why other than, it just is.\n\nHowever, playing this game alone can be a real drag. Not that you have to do all the massive work alone and it's just more work for you. But because it's just, dull. This game shines best in multiplayer. As buggy and messed up the multiplayer STILL is (Though they are working on it slowly), it's uber fun and great.\n\nThe hidden surprises this game offers are pretty cool.

Items glitching through walls indering your performence rating. Sometimes the game won't flat out lanuch or strange lag spikes. Physics system can be more annoying than it's worth and there is zero tutorials what so ever.\n\nAnother issue isn't really with the game, but most players seem to host private / password protected games which seems to hurt it's already required and messy multiplayer mode even more.\n\nIf users own the house of horror DLC, other users who don't own this DLC cannot join it for the most part.\n\nIt still needs work, clean up the multiplayer a bit, a tutorial and maybe even some type of Janitor customize and for $13.\nViscera Clean-up Detail is one of those Fun Co-Op games that all players should play.

I played a single level and cleaned everything I could. There was a part that was too high to jumpo and you had to create a staircase out of crates. This alone took over 30 minutes as the mechanics to pickup and drop with any precision is quite poor. Yes you can drop something easy enough put if it tilts because you brushed passed something then it lands out of alignment.\nI was hoping for a small semblance of story but this is just a sandbox with nothing to do but clean. It might get better with multiplayer but I think it may only last a game or two before the group wants to move onto something else.\nIt does look fairly good graphically and the squishy noises are fun but I was underwhelmed and can't see me wanting to go back to this.\nThe only thing that could draw me back is for a story mode to be added that is silly and funny, perhaps just catching glimpses of the "hero" that is making all this mess. Perhaps you can even get paid a bonus for good cleaning so you can purchase improved cleaning products, or a discarded weapon the hero dropped like a flamethrower to help remove those pesky bodies. Jump jets to reach high places. Water cannons to get to the gore on the roof. With these additions I would be swayed to return.\nThanks for reading.","August 23, 2014","false","2.4"," 79 of 120 people (66%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","66","79","120","4","4"

I'm so funny)\n\nViscera Cleanup Detail is a simulator-esque game in which you are put in the position of a "hygien technician" (or Janitor for you simple folk). You are given the task of cleaning up several rooms of a sci-fi scene where there has been a tragic and gory disaster. You must wipe the floors, walls and even ceilings which are coated in blood and dirt with body parts scattered amongst the mess.\n\nMy expierence of this game is minor but impacted. Although I might not have had this game for long, I seem to have grown quite fond to it. Although, while I was mopping up giblets, I thought "Why is a game about being a janitor of all things so intriguing?" and you may be asking that yourself, reader. I find that this game is great and fun to play because it something different aswell as being relaxing. (apart from the odd moments when you spill a dirty bucket or break a light, then ♥♥♥♥ gets frustrating)\n\nWe as gamers are used to running around gunning aliens and opponents to death, leaving a trail of destruction and gore in our path but with Viscera Cleanup Detail, we see how the person who has to clean up after us feels. We are put on the other side of the fence with VCD. Also, as I've stated, it's very relaxing compared to the fast-paced, time-limited shooters most of us play on a regular basis. Not to mention that VCD is very self-rewarding when you get to your office and see that you've left the previous area perfectly spick and span.\n\nIn summary: I thoroughly recommend this game because of it's calming vibe, difference and it's ability to transform something so mundane into something appealing and fun to play.","April 20, 2014","true","10.8"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","20","21","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JacquesLeSauve/recommended/246900/","JacquesLeSauve","JacquesLeSauve","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JacquesLeSauve/","591 products in account","Let me set the scene for you...\n\nA young, magenta-haired woman walks into the lobby of a corporate HQ building at the strike of noon. She's dressed in white and has a katana slung over her back, a pistol resting at each side, and a loosely-fitting belt adorned with multiple spherical devices. Her eyes narrow and shift from side to side as she surveys her surroundings; a large, gleaming chamber, almost clinical in the sterile cleanliness of its features, pillars rising up to meet the skylight covering the whole expanse of the ceiling to give a view of the rest of the OmniCorp building as it fades up into the clouds, the straight line between the front doors and the elevators being broken only by a large, glass, ringed desk in the middle of the room with a pristinely presented receptionist stoically waiting with a smug, controlling look on her face. The whiteness of the room helping to make the presence of the black-suited men all the more apparent as they stand uniformly with white shirts, black ties, black shades and earpieces, each guard being virtually indistinct from the other.\n\nThe girl casually strolls up to the desk, holding the gaze of the receptionist the entire time, and confidently purrs "I'd like to speak with the boss". Taken aback by this tooled-up figure - the smug look now wiped from her face - the receptionist hesitantly asks "Do you... do you have an appointment?". Zoomed in on the side of our heroine's jaw, we see a faint smile begin to emerge in the corner of her mouth. In the blink of an eye she pulls out her katana and cleaves through the monitor, keyboard and straight through the glass desk in one clean cut. The receptionist shrieks and falls backwards to the floor, the guards now steadily approaching as she makes her hysterical retreat. The girl is now encircled by a swarm of guards, all with weapons drawn and pointed at her. She slowly places her katana back in its rest and holds her hands in the air. She bows her head for a moment, looking almost as if resigned to defeat, then the smile begins to creep back again as she swiftly reaches for her guns, aims them skywards and unloads into the skylight overhead. Shards rain down and pierce the flesh of unsuspecting guards as she charges past them and slides across the floor taking cover behind the nearest pillar. Some of the guards lay skewered on the ground, many others are wounded. The ones that remain take aim at the pillar and unleash their rage upon it as they let lead fly. Oh yeah, now it's on...\n\nShe takes a sharp breath then runs towards the wall and scales across it as her own guns blaze, and time seems to slow down as a hail of bullet holes trail behind her and riddle the OmniCorp logo in her wake. She's taken out two opponents as they slump to the floor right before she takes refuge behind the next pillar. More bullets spray at the concrete beside her and turn it to dust, then out from the cloud leaps a blur of white as it lunges toward a guard, grabs hold of his head, swings around from it, snapping it as she uses it to launch herself onto the shoulders of the next oppressor, then, legs wrapped around him, backflips to the ground making short work of his neck, too. As more suits begin to fire on her, she scurries beneath the corpse and shields herself as it erupts in an explosion of gunfire and heavy red mist. Hearing the clicks of their now spent weapons, she sprints to the nearest black thing with her katana drawn and plunges it straight through his chest. Seeing the rest of his friends running toward her, she slams a button at the bottom of the blade's handle and extends it to twice its length. With a primal yell, she pushes forward and starts collecting corpses, one after another... Three, four, five twitching bodies, all with a blade through their hearts as they uncontrollably stumble backwards and ram into a wall. She hammers the button again and the handle retracts into the wall, effortlessly punching a hole through all their chests and sticking into the white marble as the bodies all fall down. She yanks it out, extends it once more, shakes off the blood with a single, jolting swipe, then slots it back into its sheath and makes her way to the elevator.\n\nRight as she sets foot inside, a whole swath of black suits come piling in through the lobby doors and rush in her direction. She pulls off a sphere from her belt, rolls it to the centre of the floor and blows them all a kiss with a playful wink. Just as the elevator doors ding closed, a blinding flash of light blasts out from the orb and eviscerates all around it. In slow motion we see waves of rippling blood gush through the air and spraying against the ivory walls. Black, steaming skeletons lay partially submerged in a swamp of red goo, and all that remains is the silence of death... Then, shortly after, a small door opens at the side, and a diminutive figure in overalls and rubber gloves steps out. This is where you come into the story - with a mop, a bin and a bucket. Ladies and gentlemen... welcome to Viscera Cleanup Detail!\n\n*roll title sequence with awesome rock music and shredding guitar*\n\nIn this game you'll enter the scene after all the action has already happened, and your job is to clean everything up and have the place looking good as new. Pick up body parts and shell casings, mop up pools of blood, and just generally remove any evidence of any badness having ever happened. It's pretty much the antithesis of every first-person shooter ever. And it's f*cking incredible.\n\nIt's amazing just how cathartic it is collecting meat chunks, assembling them into large hazardous waste bins then chucking them into an incinerator for a couple of hours. There's plenty of variety of stages as well, from sewer tunnels to space stations to twisted research labs to security robot showrooms. And just when you think you've seen everything, they'll give you something new to either see or do, all wrapped up in a gloriously twisted, dark sense of humour. There's even something of a story hidden away among the notes and odd trinkets scattered throughout the levels that can turn the game into something of a mythical treasure hunt, for anyone interested in following up on it. And best of all, you can even mop up with friends as multiple people can band together online and all chip in for a relaxing session of viscera spring cleaning.\n\n[Once again, for some reason this won't post properly to include a certain paragraph and I've had to post it in the Comments instead, so read it there... G*ddammit, Steam! Ditto with your stupid censoring that requires asterisks]\n\nIt's not all perfect, as there can be some issues with objects clipping into one another (though that's mostly to comedic effect) or the final phase of stages can be a chore as you stack dozens of crates and barrels in designated areas, and don't get me started on the glass. But these are minor grievances to an otherwise clever, unique, joyous experience. I really can't recommend it enough. Buy it right now!

It's very tedious (which some folks may enjoy) and some of the maps take HOURS to complete alone, but with friends it can be great and takes less time.\n\nPROS\n\n1) Microsoft Sam text-to-speech for in-game chat is HILARIOUS. Seriously makes the game 100x better. Try it. Nothing better than being a grown adult and saying inappropriate things in chat just to hear that monotonous robotic voice say it out loud. Had myself and my friends laughing so hard we were almost throwing up. It also says things kind of sarcastically.\n\n2) The broken game physics, which is a cause of most of the cons listed below, can actually be funny sometimes. Like mops randomly killing people and bins glitching across the floor.\n\n3) Funny things like giblets coming out of machines they shouldn't come out of, and really nice atmopshere and setups with interesting backstories.\n\nCONS\n\n1) No music in-game. Why does the main menu have neat ambient music but the game doesn't? For such a long, sometimes boring and tedious game where you have to obsessively focus on every detail for hours, why can't we have something to listen to?\n\n2) The bins. Seriously. The biohazard bins are a total mess. I can barely use them. The point is to put giblets, trash, bullet shells and other small items in them to make it easier to collect and carry them to the furnace. But the bins are so broken the items inside usually clip into the bin and make the bin rocket around randomly, or the bin decides to just start glitching like mad and bang around, or teleport randomly, etc. Either way it usually spills some, or all, of the contents, forcing you to pick EVERYTHING back up again. Very annoying. For a game where those bins are provided to us to use, why can't we use them properly ?? I know it's in early access but please for the love of god fix the bins.\n\n3) A seriously annoying an game-breaking bug I keep encountering is the inability to grab things. Sometimes just randomly will not allow me to pick things up anymore. Or, the game won't show the item in my hands- it still shows the item on the floor- but the game still considers me to be holding them. So when I drop the item, it teleports onto the ground wherever I "dropped" it, causing glitching. Sometimes on my friends' screen they can see me holding an item but on my own screen it appears that I'm NOT holding it. Makes carrying anything nearly impossible. Only way to fix is to quit the game/server and restart/rejoin. Happens several times per game.\n\n4) Things that are almost, or entirely, unreachable. Some giblets or trash are in places almost impossible to reach, under tables (in a game where there is no crouch mechanism) or splashes of blood on the CEILING where there is no way to reach it by jumping or stacking boxes, especially since boxes and bins are so glitchy they fling themselves around insanely when standing on them. Maybe putting blood on the ceiling in an unreachable location could be fixed, eh?\n\n5) Sometimes mops randomly kill my friends. It's actually kind of funny. And also sometimes those stupid bins, or other items glitching so hard they rocket into my friends and kill them. Funny but perhaps could be fixed lol.","October 28, 2014","true","9.3"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","21","24","0","0"

That includes blood, bodies, "we are doomed" written with blood on the wall, bullet shells and bullet holes! Especially bullet holes! We don't want the scientists hiding drugs in there!\n\nNow that you know you job, let's talk specifics!

Now, some of you are starting to look for another game AND WHO SAID YOU CAN DO THAT?! KEEP READING! The devs are updating the game reguraly, from bug fixes to new maps!\n\nOverall, the game is reguraly updated, the gameplay is fun (for some reason), it looks great and it's great if you don't want to think a lot when you play or just want to unleash your inner janitor!","December 29, 2014","true","31.0"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","90","19","21","13","1"

The environments are well put together, with plenty of well...viscera.    Gameplay  7  Can be a blast, but you need to be in the right mood. Viscera seriously caters to the OCD in you. A clever and amusing reversal of roles, you find yourself cleaning up the mess left behind after terrible experiments gone wrong, alien attacks, etc. Put down the gun, and pick up the mop. The controls lend themselves to making silly mistakes and more of a mess, and while intentional it can get a little frustrating sometimes as you're trying to clean the place. Keep an eye out for hints in levels to open some doors.    Story  N/A  You're part of the cleanup crew, sent to mop up after whatever event led to the grisly state these facilities are in. No real story here.    Multiplayer  8  A surprisingly refreshing, and completely amusing multiplayer experience. Group up with your friends to clean this mess up! Laugh as you make ridiculous mistakes together, knocking over buckets of blood accidentally, dragging bodies across walls and splattering their remnants everywhere.    Replayability  6  As amusing as it is to take up the role of janitor, you can only do it so many times. The saving grace here is the free levels they occasionally release (so far, Shadow Warrior, and Santa's Rampage)    Overall  7/10  While an amusing, unique, polished game, Viscera isn't something you'll boot up a whole lot to enjoy. But you will certainly get your money's worth out of it in laughs with your friends. I recommend picking this one up (especially when on sale), even if only for how unique the concept is.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/johnathonm/recommended/246900/","johnathonm","Werd","http://steamcommunity.com/id/johnathonm/","194 products in account","---The world's first OCD simulator--- 10/10 for triggering my OCD when it comes to cleaning. It's a unique and innovative concept which has never been done before in gaming. It creates a new paradigm in cleaning simulators that can only be countered by cleaning in real life.\n\nThis is possibly the world's first OCD simulator. I have never found myself wanting to go back constantly and clean EVERYTHING. Think of this game (I don't know if I can call it a game but more of a "trigger") as taking part after say DOOM or whatever Space Marine simulator you prefer.\n\nNow, imagine it's about a few days after the incident and the company wants to use the base again. Well, someone has to clean up the mess and that's you. You are assigned the fun task of picking up the pieces of people, cleaning up the blood splatter, the shell casings, dumping the toxic waste barrels into the furnace, picking up the pieces of trash (like the empty takeout food boxes), and having to both mop up and sweep up. It's as fun as it sounds, trust me.\n\nNow, you are alone, in the base in silence. All you have is your map, broom, your hands (wearing cleaning gloves of course, have to be safe), and some random ghost busters looking thing which I have no idea what it actually does since the game doesn't tell you. So, off you go on your task to start the cleanup. Fun OCD adventues will soon ensue.\n\nYou start out next to a dispenser and if you push the button (most of the time) a bucket of clean water will be dispensed. You pick this up and take it over to the first area you want to clean. So, you use your trusty mop, dunk it in the bucket (which is a project in itself since you can easily splash the bucket - that becomes a problem as the water gets dirty) or what usually happens is you spill it. This leaves the floor wet. No problem you think, I'll just get another bucket. So you walk over, get another bucket and think ok, no problem. You pick up the task where you left off. Then you happen to look down to refresh your mop - well shi!!!!! the water you spilled caused you to leave footprints as you walked back to the bucket station.\n\nNow, not only do you have to clean up the inital mess but you have to clean up your footprints. More fun ensues, as your bucket water gets pretty nasty fast (I mean you are cleaning up blood, toxic waste, dead children and the sorts). So, you go bust out your trusty mop and start trying to clean that up. Well, once again, the water gets dirty. So, soon you start collecting buckets. The game doesn't tell you what to do with any of the trash, including the buckets, so maybe you figure out that the big metal thing behind you is a furnace. So, you go pick up the bucket full of dirty water, but because you moved too fast, it spills. The bucket makes it into the furnace but now as you walk back to get another bucket you leave footprints all over the place since the water was dirty.\n\nThis time, because Zeus loves you, you click the button for a new bucket, and behold, a bloody body part is dispensed, you pick it up and accidentially touch the machine - blood everywhere. So, you go and burn the body part. Another body part will be dispensed and this time you don't touch the machine, but you still have to dispose of it. You carry it over and do your thing. Go back and BAM! you get a bucket of clean water. However, since you dirtied the machine, you have to clean the machine now. By the time you get back to the original mess your bucket water is already half dirty and pretty much only good for a dunk or two.\n\nSo, you burn up the bucket. If you are lucky you didn't spill it this time. You go back and repeat the cycle, but then you walk in the area which is still wet. Well it's your lucky day because now you have to mop up the area where you just tracked up with footprints.\n\nOh and don't forget your trusty broom which as you push objects around starts smearing blood and poop across the floor. So, you have to clean that up too. There is also some laser/fire thing but I don't think that was very helpful as all it did was blow the bodies into chunks.\n\nThis game is the greatest OCD simulator ever developed for the PC. I cannot recommend it enough if you have issues with cleanliness and want to experience the joy of cleaning up a virtual world with the problems of real world cleaning. I don't know if you can ever really "win" as after about 15 minutes of cleaning up the same spot and then dirtying it up again, I realized that it would never meet my godly standards for cleanliness.\n\nI give this game a 10/10 for being the first OCD simulator. I have never "played" anything like it and it triggered the OCD in me. If you have OCD, and want to virtually clean in circles, this is the game for you. If I were on a hardcore strteet drug like evil crystal I might have spent hours playing this game. However, since I am not into evil crystal nor do I want to have my OCD triggered by a "Game" this isn't for me.\n\nHowever, if you are speeding along on evil crystal, this is quite possibly the greatest outlet ever for that infinite energy that you supposedly get. You can channel it in the virtual world instead of cleaning on single spot in your house for 5 hours, you can do it in a post-space marine warzone. It would be an excellent place to channel all that energy.\n\nOtherwise, if you are like me, you will want to punch a hole in the wall after seeing that you left footprints because you walked in your dirty water, or spilled the bucket, or tried to sweep up the trash only to smear blood and green goo everywhere.

SHE DID MAP GUIDES AND SHE DIDN'T REVIEW THE GAME?".\n\nWhat do you want me to tell, mopping these maps are just so fun that I've been saying it on Playblink, Steamgifts and any friend that is wondering if the game is worthy.\n\nYou're a janitor in a space station - sometimes sent to some planets - always cleaning the mess around, caused by genetically modified creatures, aliens, special military division sent to dispose of these and the scientists, which means mopping blood, incinerating body parts or body bags or entire bodies, trash (cans, noodle boxes), bullet cases, toxic goo, repairing holes caused by the guns, etc. etc.\n\nAnd while you're at it, since a newer version, you can bring back unique items to your office like a Face Hugger, Gordon Freeman's assests, Duke Nukem's, Isaac Clarke's helmet, and any other easter eggs (litteraly). Besides, with the datalogs and pages let by workers, you'll learn more about what happened, the causes and the orders given to the soldiers. And why not, keep traces of codes to enter some areas, needing your cleaning but closed.\n\nTo do so, you'll find an incinerator to burn what you need to burn (or an airlock in one case), a water bucket dispenser, a disposal bin dispenser, a vending device when you need medikits back to their places or light, a laser welder that can repair and burn (but with stains in that case) holes, brooms, J-Harm, sort of mini-lift and maybe other items that I'm bound to forget.\n\nEach level can be small to huge, on several floors, with dispensers not always near of each other. Unearthly Excavation can take hours to complete alone for example.\n\nYou can guess that the main ambiance of the game isn't a scary one but more a comedy one. Finding Bob is fun as he's a psychopath (or not) and you're one step behind him, even if you'll never rattle him out. And getting an Employee of the Month award is also a great filling.\n\nAnyway, you've understood, I play alone. But you can also bring friends with you, kill them to get them replaced, annoy them by messing around or simply play the game normally.\n\nAnd don't worry for the music! You have a radio on each level that play great tracks.\n\nViscera Cleanup Detail is maybe in Early Access since some time. But the developers are working hard. They added more and more features making me forced to complete my maps and cursing them for that pain (but what a pleasure in the end). And they're nearing the 1.0, the final release.\n\nThanks to the devs listening and answering the community and thanks to the community, Viscera Cleanup Detail will be one of these games that you will never regret supporting in Early Access.\n\nFor 10 bucks, you're not ripped off. BUY IT! Because while my cleaning skills are still a mess IRL and in the game, it is really relaxing to do so. And because you want to find Bob.","October 17, 2015","true","217.6"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","15","15","2","0"

This game is one of the best simulation games I have ever played. Something about cleaning up a bloody mess and placing it in a bin and then burning it is satisfying. Plus, the speedrun, which keeps track of you score and grades you gives you a sense of accomplishment. There are tons of easter eggs and little notes you can find around the maps which give most of them a background story.\nThe multiplayer is phenomenal.  You can either work together to clean the map, or you can derp around messing everthing up.\n\n420/69\n\nP.S One thing i think they should add in the game that would really change it is an achievement for cleaning each map decent enough\n\nP.P.S The devs are very kind and are always listening.

Well, not so blindly, I had seen some personalities online play it ever so slightly. But all in all I thought that this will be an experience like Goat Simulator. Fun for the first few times, but something that soon turns stale (if you pardon my opinion of Goat Sim).\n\nI was delightfully wrong. I do not know what it is that keeps me returning to this game in both singleplayer and multiplayer modes (especially in multiplayer, for that is truly where the salt of this game lies), but I like it. Perhaps it is the idea that you get to see what it is like to be on the receiving end of the rampages of action heroes and videogame protagonists, except instead of getting a bullet to the face, you get to mop up the remains of those who here higher on the corporate ladder than you ever will be. There is just.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/XmiseryX/recommended/246900/","XmiseryX","Misery","http://steamcommunity.com/id/XmiseryX/","382 products in account","First, to get it out of the way, I'm a bit more familiar with the game than my small-ish number of hours with it might have you believe.  I first played this elsewhere.  I hate having to point that out in reviews, but you know how it is...\n\nAnyway, Viscera Cleanup Detail... you know, this kinda reminds me of back when Harvest Moon came out on the SNES, a million years ago.  I saw that game, wondered "This is a game about farming... how could this be any fun?", but tried it myself anyway, and, well... suffice it to say, THAT series has been around for a long, long time now.  It's kinda like that; a game that seems like a fantastically stupid idea on paper, but it just works anyway.\n\nOr is it a stupid idea?  Games like this have been popular lately; things like Euro Truck Simulator, or Farming Simulator, or various other things of that nature, those games pop up and end up being pretty popular.  This game is a bit along those lines, except that it's taking a realistic job (janitor) and putting it in a not-so-realistic location (bloody sci-fi environments filled with exploded space nerds).\n\nThe basic idea is simple:  You know all those violent 3D FPS games where you're exploding a bazillion monsters, robots, or evil jerks, with blood and bullets going all over the place?  Well, in this game, THAT stuff already happened.  It's over.  And YOU are the one called in to then clean up the mess.\n\nAnd boy, what a mess it is!  There is a TON of blood and gore and other mysterious fluids.  It's all over the place.  Not to mention all of the spent bullet casings, random broken things, smashed up equipment, randomly strewn junk, garbage... the amount of things that need to be dealt with in each level will seem extremely daunting when you first enter a given level.  You really have your work cut out for you!\n\nIn order to avoid getting fired, you have to be very meticulous.  You want to try to clean PERFECTLY, if you can... not missing a single spot with your Space Mop (TM) or variety of other tools (including a laser welder gun, which has various entertaining uses).  You have to use the tools you always have with you, combined with objects that need to be carried around, such as buckets, bins, lights, and other things, and also special machines stationed around the map.  Machines such as bucket/bin dispensers (sometimes also known as "severed limb 3D printers that occaisionally malfunction and give you a bucket or bin instead"), special vending machines, a big metal lift thing, and of course the all-important incinerator, the final destination for... basically everything.  And a big purple boom-box with a ton of selectable music which vibrates out of control if set to full volume and can set off nearby explosives and such (....what?).  You'll see what I mean if you mess with that thing too much, it appears in every level.  Just dont say I didnt warn you.\n\nBut that's not all!  For bonus points, there's other things you can do too.  Feel like playing a bit of a CSI role?  Well you can!  Try to piece together what happened in each area, and more importantly, exactly how each person died.  Is a particular corpse leaning against a bloody wall, with a bunch of bullet holes nearby?  Well then, he was probably shot to death.  That's a very simple example, some others are... a bit more confusing. There's some where you'll look at some guy (or what's left of him) and go "...what in the funky hell happened to this guy?". But it's fun to try to figure them out, and each dead guy has a name associated with them, and you can stick their USB things (each corpse has one) into the machine to fill out an optional report detailing just what happened to the poor guy.  Get it right (or mostly right, you're expected to give your "best estimate" and ARENT required to be absolutely 100% perfect when writing up your report, but you want to try to be as accurate as you can) and you'll get a bit of a bonus.   There are a variety of ways to get such bonuses, which can be used to make up for small messes that you might miss.\n\nThat all of course is if you're playing the game properly... you also, of course, have the option of just flinging stuff around and making a bigger mess, or doing things like that.  Detailed physics and all.  And that's part of what makes the game what it is, is some of the wacky things that might happen at any given moment.  Even when you're really playing properly and trying to do your best, well... sometimes, that's when some of the funniest things might happen (it's always most hilarious if it's spontaneous and unexpected, after all).  Maybe you're transporting a huge bunch of biohazard bins filed with gory bits down an elevator, and the elevator gives a bit of a nasty jolt when it reaches the bottom, and suddenly... it's raining gibs!  Or you might knock over a light and suddenly things are on fire, or stuff just goes flying all over the place, or... well, you'll have to see for yourself some of the things that can happen.\n\nOne thing about the game though, to me, is that it's relaxing.  I think this might be one of the most attractive things about the "simulator" type games; it's nice to have something that's very different from the usual violent action games for once, something that's actually calm (yet still often hilarious).  And this game does that very well (and if something frustrating DOES happen, you are definitely able to grab and fling random things around in great frustration, as seen in one of the game's trailers).  And actually managing to 100% every level takes quite alot of work and is actually pretty hard.  And there's an overall story that's out there to find concerning a certain janitor that came before you, and.... well, I dont want to spoil that too much.  A hint though, start out by exploring your office a bit first before jumping into the main levels.  Some of the things you can find in there are.... interesting.  If you can figure out how to get through the doors, that is.\n\nLastly, the levels themselves are VERY well made, with incredible detail and a bazillion things to interact with.  LOTS to do in each, and hidden stuff to find.  Oh, and the graphics are utterly fantastic.  I dont normally bother talking about graphics... as I'm the sort that'll happily sit there with an ancient Atari 2600 for hours... but sometimes they are worth talking about, and in this game, the spectacular visuals are a great added bonus.  The game is gorgeous. But you'll want a pretty beefy machine if you're going to max it out.\n\nOh, and it comes with a level editor, and Steam Workshop compatibility.\n\n\nOverall, sure, the game isnt going to be for everyone.  This sort of game never is. If you've always thought that the "simulator" sorts of games were nothing but stupid jokes, this isnt the game for you.  But for those that like this sort of thing... this is easily one of the best (and again, alot of potential hilarity here).   You'll get your money's worth out of this one.  Just be prepared for that.... that irritating moment when you THINK you've gotten 100% or better in a level, only to find out... you got 99%... stuff just might get flung around the office at that point.\n\nOh, and before I forget:  This game does indeed have co-op.  My experience with the game is all solo... I'm not a big fan of co-op gaming... but from what I hear, the hilarity increases tenfold when you're playing it with friends.","April 9","true","47.1"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","13","13","0","1"

What may not occur to you, is this is actually a real job what you're doing. Its really hard, and most that do it do not survive for very long.\n\nI've been with this game from the very beginning and it goes without saying that I've been utterly pleased with it. Even its offshoots are great.\n\nIts not a fad game. It never 'took off'. It never had its moment and hopefully never will; this is a game that deserves to be discovered with wild eyes and a wet mop. This game deserves to be found as the calming zen-like, ocd-destroyer of a game that it is.\n\nThere is no danger so as long as you're smart. No ammo to keep track of, and nothing is actually trying to kill you. You're just Joe, trying to clean stuff up.\n\nIts got problems though; and nearly all of them have to do with its physics engine. While its certainly a good one, its really hard to actually get rid of bullet casings. And intestines. And hands will still sometimes clip through the floor. This action makes it basically impossible to get a hold of, and its detectable. So you're screwed.  They added a broom to make casings and trash easier to pick up but personally; I'd prefer a vaccum.\n\nThey threw in references to various games here and there in the form of workers logs usually.

I'm a huge fan of games that question what it is to be a game- all the weird stuff on Kongregate, The Stanley Parable, anything that's every been called a "notgame"- and this fits the bill perfectly, but in a slightly less existential way. It's a perfect experience for someone who wants something new and inventive, but not particularly thought-provoking- and also absolutely hysterical.\nMy only complaint would be the occasionally bugged physics (my buckets have a habit of sinking into the floor and require quite a bit of mop violence to excavate) but this is a work in progress and I'm sure that'll be part of an update.\nSo, for an in-progress game pioneering in the realm of janitorial simulators (mixed with Dead Space, of course, because no game is complete without alien viscera), this...

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zusemc/recommended/246900/","zusemc","Zuse","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zusemc/","249 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI bought this game and in two days I had over 12 hours of gameplay. This is not a common thing for me anymore.\n\nI don't know what it is, if it's the thrill of looking at a room and being disgusted and lazy of how much you'll have to work, or walking around the same room when it's all squeaky clean and feeling accomplished. Something about this game appeals to me.\n\nOf course that this is not a game for everybody, as sometimes I also need some time to recharge my will of play, but it really is fun, and I bet that with friends it should be a lot better, too. Good luck trying to convince them, though.\n\nFor the few complaints I have so far:\n- Buckets: Sometimes, when cleaning the mop, you hit the water perfectly but it still doesn't count, so you have to try again. And they flip WAY too easily as well (might be a game mechanic or simply bad coding, either way, it sucks in my opinion).\n\n- Dispensers: The fact that sometimes it will drop body parts instead of buckets or disposal bins is NOT fun at all, to me. Yes, I understand, it's a game mechanic, so it will probably stay the way it is, but I just don't like it. It makes me more annoyed than surprised.\n\n- Laser gun/Welder: It should be in your inventory after you pick it up for the first time. Having to drop it when you want to change your tools and backtracking for it every time is annoying.\n\n- Physics: Iffy. When you put stuff in the disposal bins, they sometimes "drop" through its bottom. Also, the ragdoll physics are not very good. What happens to date is that when you pick an object, the center of the object is where you will grab it, and right clicking flips the object to be "straight" up. The pivot point of the grabbed object should be where the cursor was, and then after right clicking, rotate the object and center the point to the center of the object (as is right now).\n\nThat's about everything that I can remember for now.\n\nA small suggestion or idea I had that could be added:\n- Magnet: Used to pick up shotgun shells and bullets, maybe other small metallic objects. Because of now, the only way is to picking them up individually, which is somewhat tiresome. But then again, it IS a janitor simulator after all, so I think it's fair not having such thing.\n\nOverall, I recommend this game, but not for everybody. Look at the screenshots, watch gameplay of it, try to get some friends to play with you if you feel like you don't want to play alone.\n\nEDIT:\n\nAfter having played online with a friend, I decided to add some more body to this review. Nothing above the EDIT line has been changed.\n\nI will (briefly) describe a few changes I myself and my friend would like to see done in this game.\n\nAs they follow: for one, the multiplayer. It's bad. Like, SERIOUSLY bad. It needs a LOT of improvement. Even though our ping remains under 50, we have to take turns hosting a game, because it is horrible for client(s) to play (hosts are always fine). Some problems the clients face are that sometimes you cannot see other players or you are completely unsynced with one-another; disposal bins don't work properly, as in "everything inside of it will collide with each other and will burst leaving nasty stuff everywhere". Seriously annoying.\n\nAnother thing, the object rotation must be reworked, in other words, it must actually exist. As of now, you can't rotate objects at will, you can only flip them up, and that's it. You should be able to rotate them like you do in Amnesia: The Dark Descent, for example, where you hold the left button and move the mouse in the direction you want to rotate the object.\n\nThird and final factor, perhaps the sniffer should also be reworked. I honestly can't suggest much, I just think it's pretty... useless. While it does tell you there's something dirty in the vicinity, sometimes it will still beep when there's nothing there. Maybe changing the sniffer's organic mode to an UV light, in which you point it at a surface and if there's blood or other fluids it will glow, and the non-organic mode perhaps could be changed to a portable metal detector. I don't know for sure, I just think it should be reworked as well.\n\nI will try to suggest these things on the game's forum as well.\n\nThank you for your time.","June 29, 2015","true","30.0"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","10","10","0","0"

There's not much to the actual gameplay and you'll get the hang of the mechanics quickly, but the game looks very striking for an indie production and the story told through various notes and diary entries you can find through the numerous maps lends life to a game that's otherwise full of extremely dead things. The end-of-level scoring system is also remarkably novel - instead of a bunch of arbitrary numbers, you find yourself in your modest janitorial office at the end of each shift, with inspection reports and newspaper articles detailing your specific failures (or lack thereof) with plenty of humour.\n\nThe physics engine is still fairly rough, as might be expected with games made in the Unreal engine, but even that provides a masochistic kind of fun as you find yourself sliding into and knocking over a bucket full of human juice... again. This game really captures the hypothetical essence of begrudgingly working at the bottom rung of an unscrupulous corporation, but in space!\n\nIt might not be the best experience if you want your adrenaline to get pumping, but if you've got a couple of hours to spare and some podcasts to catch up on, it's really a great way to pass the afternoon.","July 27, 2014","true","91.1"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","1"

You must travel between various space stations cleaning the sci-fi messes heroes left behind making the place spotless again. The game’s only goal is for you to do your job properly, make it appear as if nothing happened in that station, clock out and done!\n\nWith the game’s peacefully relaxing atmosphere you can enjoy cleaning a station at your own pace taking your time to wipe every small blood splatter or you can use the Speedrun gamemode for a faster experience. There are many different types of things you need to clean up and or fix. You can go from wiping the gory blood to using the laser gun to close up bullet holes to picking up dead bodies and throwing them into the furnace.\n\nTo completely clean up a station takes time and a pair of sharp eyes since the game’s lighting sometimes makes things like bullet holes hard to see, good thing you got your “Sniffer”, a tool that helps you “sniff out” elusive waste objects and blood splatters. As much as the Sniffer is a good tool you usually only need 2 tools, your mop and your own 2 hands. You can use your hands to get things like buckets of water or the waste disposal bins from their machines. Using the hands you can also obviously pick up things like corpses trash and intestines and throw them into the furnace to melt away.\n\nThe main tool however is the mop used to clean up almost everything, from blood to burn marks on any surface whether it’s the ceiling, floor or walls. Cleaning up the floors is usually the most important bit since stepping in alien goo or blood creates footprints which you later have to mop up as well.\n\nThe achievements in the game are tedious to get as some of them require long multi-step almost mission like things that you have to do just to get a few of the achievements so getting all of them is a very tedious progress and I wouldn’t recommend it unless you’re keen on that sort of thing.\n\nNow, why does this game work? It almost seems like a chore but it’s actually fun, madness! The whole reason this game exist is for people who like to listen to podcast and or music albums and doing something alongside that that doesn’t require a lot of thinking. This game is almost like those “Turn off your brain and enjoy” comedy movies which if you think about it too hard you won’t enjoy it.\n\nDespite the game being rather great there are a few issues with it. The physics can be a bit glitchy and when you’re talking about a game that is built on physics based items it makes it a bit frustrating at times when your dirty bucket of waters tips and you get a huge mess to clean up even though you didn’t knock it over or when a piece of intestine gets stuck in the wall and you have no way to remove it.\n\nAnother thing that’s problematic is the multiplayer, if you’re the host of the game then everything’s fine the game plays normally but, if you’re not the host the game is almost impossible the enjoy, it’s terribly laggy and glitchy and just straight up atrocious.\n\nI feel like the game could’ve used maybe just a few more months in early access before releasing to fix the multiplayer issues along with several bugs.\n\nWorth mentioning that the game runs smoothly on pretty much any hardware you own which is rather nice. There maybe some lag spikes on weaker machines but they're far between so it shouldn't be much of a problem.\n\n\nTL;DR\n\nVCD is a brilliantly simple game where you clean up the aftermath of a gory battle.

You can clean up a gravity drive that's suspiciously like the one from Event Horizon. Or you can restock health pick-ups in a tight cornered sewer level. A mad scientist's lab needs some clean up after some experiments went sideways and who could forget when Santa went on a bender and slaughtered all of the elves in his workshop?\n\nEach level takes anywhere from 30 minutes to a couple hours to clean from stem to stern.

From clearing the skies in Space Invaders to eating every last dot in Pac-Man, to the blissful calm of an empty Tetris screen, and on through the games that have descended from similar bloodlines, there's a powerful human compulsion to sweep things clean. Most of the time, that impulse is subtext or metaphor. In Viscera Cleanup Detail, it's in your face. And all over your shoes.\n\nThis is a tidy-'em-up, a game where your goal is literally to clean up a bloody big mess. It's a first-person janitor simulator in which you play as the hapless, blue-collar schlub who must venture into secret labs and space stations in the aftermath of unseen gory FPS battles and restore them to their pristine state.\n\nTo aid you in this task, you're armed with a mop, your rubber-gloved hands and a handheld "sniffer" which tells you when you've missed a bit. At first, you think it's going to be easy. You choose one of the game's seven scenarios and proceed down blood-spattered corridors, ready to mop away the body fluids. And, for a few sweeps, that works fine. Then your mop gets soaked in gore and suddenly you're making the problem worse, sploshing the mess even wider with every stroke.\n\nLuckily, every map has a Slosh-O-Matic, a machine that can produce endless buckets of clean water with which to clean your mop. So you set off to find the Slosh-O-Matic and then return to the bit you were cleaning. Only now you realise, having waded through guts and body parts to get the bucket, you've left bloody footprints all over the floor you cleaned. You press on, only to discover that now your bucket of water is so dirty that you're once again splashing even more mess onto the floor rather than cleaning it up. Back to the Slosh-O-Matic you go, this time being more careful about where you tread.\n10/10","July 21, 2014","true","4.7"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

Now you can find out!\n\nThis game is really relaxing and very satisfying when hours of cleaning eventually result in a space that is completely immaculate. I wonder why I don't get the same kind of satisfaction cleaning up in real life...\nThis game is early access, so they regularly release updates for it, and it's always fun trying out new content. It also has workshop support, so when you get tired of the stock maps, there are player creations out there for you, though I can't vouch for their number. Sometimes, I have a difficult time finding the last little meat chunk or soda can or blood spat hidden in a dark high corner of the ceiling. That hardly ruins it, but maybe RS will make this easier in the future.\n\nAs for the multiplayer, you don't have to deal with port forwarding like you do in santa's rampage. MP is handled through steam, so you can easily join your friends, or complete strangers. Let me tell you, you don't know your friends until they trek bloody footprints right across the floor you JUST finished mopping. Repeatedly.\n\n_________\n\nLet me tell you a little story about a multiplayer session I hosted with a friend of mine. We were playing the map Unearthly Excavation.  My friend sees a "sarlacc pit" in the ground and jumps in it without a second thought. He died.\n\nHe also found some explosives. Apparently, he couldn't light them, but not to be defeated he put it in the incinerator. Unfortunately, he forgot that he was supposed to run away. He exploded into little bits.\n\nWhile this is going on, I'm trying to clean up a mess that only gets messier with each water bucket carelessly spilled. That's when my friend found some explosives near me. Since I was away from the incinerator, he couldn't light them, but then I found and lit a flare. I told him I had an idea and dropped the flare next to the explosives, lighting them. I ran away, he didn't. I blew him up and got an achievement for it. My victory was short lived as I didn't realize there were more explosives that the blast had triggered. I didn't survive that one.\n\nWhen I came back and tried to clean up the mess we made, my friend asked me how to light the flares, and I told him he had to bang them against the wall (which is the truth). A part of me was wondering why he had asked, until he came running over with something that was lit. I almost immediately knew to run the hell away, but my desire to live gave way to caution, as instead of running, I looked behind me to make sure the water bucket was not there. Ultimately, we both exploded, and my desire to not make a bigger mess ended up doing just that.\n\nWe could not stop laughing.\n\n9.9/10","March 28, 2015","true","43.5"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","8","8","3","0"

In single player, the game is relaxing and great for perfectionists, completionists and anyone who just likes to get the job done.

Finally this game has been released fully! No longer do people have to "Wait until it leaves Early Access" to consider this game! Now, I apologize for not updating my review that much during the Early Access period, and sorry for waiting so long to give a full release update.  Anyway there isn't really any difference in this review, considering that the core game is the same, but I did edit a couple things, enjoy.\n\nWhat can I say about this game?  It was probably one of the greatest Early Access games I have come across.  It seems the Early Access model is abused and is filled with games that make little progress.  This game on the other hand has made plenty of progress, adding in new mechanics and maps constantly.  Even after leaving Early Access, they seem to still update the game, revisiting the awfully updated Santa's Rampage expansion and having it be a part of free DLC instead of Standalone, a benefit of this being that you can now play it in the modern version of the engine, instead of the buggy mess that is the older engine.\n\nGameplay  This game is about cleaning, which is very odd, I mean how can they make a game about cleaning fun?  Well, it is simple, they make sure that it is interesting.  You take on the roll of a space janitor, cleaning for various companies.  What do you clean up exactly?  Viscera!  You clean up various dead bodies, organs, blood spots, radioactive materials, aliens, and even the normal trash that would consist of soda cans and potato chip bags.  When you are cleaning you are using various tools to get the job done, such as your mop, the newly added broom (Which sadly seems to not be very useful...), the welder, and many more.  In order to have a job well done, you must weld all the bullet holes, mop up any messes you see, and incinerate any trash or even bodies you find.  The concept sounds simple and dumb, but trust me when I say that you will be spending hours enjoying yourself while you clean, especially if you have a friend to bring with you.\n\nStory  Each map has it's own story.  It is told by the various notes scattered around the map and the various hints as to what really happened before you were tasked of cleaning.  I find it really interesting how they try to tell the story of each facility through the eyes of the janitor, the person who is tasked of cleaning the aftermath of the action.  There is even some story found inside your own office, which I will not spoil, but let's just say there is a small surprise found behind every door.\n\nContent  Let's just say there is a ton of content in this game.  There are plenty of official maps that are already added, especially as of now.  Each map can take you a good amount of time, and thanks to the new save feature, you can pick up and return to each map if you wish.  With each map there is also easter eggs and other things to look out for in each map too, so there is even some side content.  Also included with the purchase of the base game is the Shadow Warrior and Christmas standalone maps, which are sadly a bit outdated when it comes to the engine.  Speaking of crossovers though I REALLY wish this game had more crossover maps, in the form of either standalone or just maps in general, it would be cool to clean up Black Mesa from Half-Life or possibly Aperture Science from Portal.\n\nPerformance/Optimization  So far optimization in this game is really good.  The game doesn't lag too much from what I played.  I have a decent PC, not the best but good enough for gaming.  There is one problem however, and that is multiplayer.  Playing multiplayer is possible and is actually 100% playable with some precautions.  If you tread too much and make more of a mess than what you started with, you will start to lag, and if you are hosting then the other person playing will start to see some interesting glitches.  Even if you play and have the place near clean you still see glitches as someone who is not hosting, such as the mysterious kamikaze blue bin.\n\nOverall  This game is great, it is a blast with friends, and despite it being a cleaning simulator, it is still a boatload of fun!  Plenty of content for the money, even if it is 3$ more than it was during Early Access.","September 18, 2015","true","81.6"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","2"

Lame", and that my friend, is where people like that, miss out on something more.\n\n\nAt the heart of it, the game is about working together with others as a team (or alone if you want to blow off an hour or so per each map) in doing a common goal, all while making sure to not make mistakes like dropping stuff on the ground, thus making creating a mess again, or knocking over a dirty bucket of water.   People with OCD, will either really enjoy this game because of that feeling of accomplishment when they clean up the entire area, or it will be a nearly endless nightmare with everything being messed up, out of order, dirty, etc.\n\nNow to the bare brass.\n\n\nGameplay:  It is a first-person game in which you use your default tools, mop, sniffer (used to sniff for organic and non-organic spots/items), and your hands (to pick up stuff).   In certain maps, there are other tools to use such as a shovel to fill in pits, a laser gun to fix bullet holes or to incinerate large items.   Some maps, even have interactive objects to do various things, such as gaining access to other rooms, or gas chambers to gas anything inside of it.    Aside from that, are there buckets of water to use in conjunction with your mop to clean the floors and ceiling, and a waste basket to toss in junk that will then be tossed into the furnace.   In the most recent update, a new mechanic of Planting, was added.   Also, map trials are in the game, so if you want to see who is the fastest cleaner in the business, then do a trial run and find out.  IMO, duo games, or games with three or four, would be interesting to see, and to see what time it takes for a team to complete a site.\n\n\nSounds:  Unique sounds for various items in the game.  Background ambience was amazingly good.   Aside from that, nothing too special.\n\nVisuals:  Ok, so we all know how visuals can be a big deal for people.  Well, the graphics here, are actually pretty nice, wether theyare maxxed out, or set to low.  The maps used to be trippy with lag spikes, but a few optimizations later, and the maps run very smooth.  Their newest map with the man-eating plants, are a bit laggy, but overall, they do a nice job at keeping the game smooth in performance.\n\n\nEarly Game:   Yes, this is one of those EA games where they are not done, and some people grab their pitchfork and start shouting with others about burning the witch, errr I mean Banning the EAs, but the devs have been able to keep up with fairly steady updates that usually have a brand new, not just a reskin, map that is unique and enjoyable.   Heck, their last 4 maps were simply amazing and unique in location/settings.   The devs have gotten to a stage where they are going to focus on another project of theirs, and then come back and add a few more things, and eventually have a full release which will hopefully include the ability for players to create their own maps.\n\n\n\nOverall:   Some people will like this, others, won't, for  those who don't, I say to them, give it a chance.  It just might grow on to you.  Besides, when it comes to modern games, a lot of them are about shoot this, shoot that, where as this, is about coordinating what to do, how to do it, and seeing if you can do it even faster (especially if playing with friends)\n\n\n\n\nUPDATE:   I will post some updates here.  Recent update added another map (good size, nice simple design) and a lot more unique sound effects for various items in the game.   Few more bugs were fixed, performance improved, easier to connect o other players too.   Another map was added as well with even more unique features.  One feature that is neat is name cards.  Find them all and punch them into the machine to do a role call on all people in the map.","September 7, 2014","true","51.8"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","6"

Mop your way through level after gory level, taking ample time out of your real day to clean an imaginary location.  This game uses what I like to call "Octopus Physics." (In Honor of OctoDad)  Not an actual, scientific term, Octopus Physics are where everything essentially has no weight-- only volume.  It's when you can forcibly knock over a bin filled with body parts by tossing an empty soda can into it.  Octopus physics cause delightful chaos and one often ends up making a much much bigger mess of things before all is said and done.\n\nIn addition to your janitorial duties, one also has to file paperwork!  Don't forget to fill out your IR-8 Incident Reports, detailing the situation as well as WTF-12 forms on each of the deceased.

No tutorial, no helpful UI, nothing!  Sure, there are some great guides out there and a keybind chart, but that's no excuse for a lack of tutorial level(s) or instructions.\n\nWho I recommend this to:\nI recommend this to detail oriented individuals, and anyone who feels (or yearns for) a sense of satisfaction at a job well done.

I knew exactly the type of game I was getting, and the machanics actually worked well. Well, they worked acceptably. The carry mechanics in Unreal (Which make up the most of the game) aren't great, but I can see those getting better in a future beta. It's a beta, and it feels like it, but there are the underpinnings of a really polished game.\n\nHowever, it's not a game I think I could ever ENJOY, not beyond maybe a level and a half. It is almost exactly like cleaning in real life. Mopping up blood is pretty rewarding, although the bucket mechanic is infuriating. Picking up trash and bodies never felt fun to me in the same way, and after a while the mopping part got pretty old as well.\n\nBesides mopping and trash collection, there's a couple distractions. The logs scattered around each level are pretty interesting, in a Bioshock-y or Dead Space-y way (There's an overt reference to Dead Space in one of them; I'm sure there are many more references to find... If you keep playing after 1 level). There's also a little minigame where you organize crates or barrels, and a sort-of-hidden gun that fixes bullet holes (unless you use it recklessly, when it just stains everything and makes more holes). None of these are bad, but they aren't really enough to break the monotony of trash/mop/rinse/repeat.\n\nThe best quality of the game, honestly, is the deadpan sarcasm coating its entire existence. It's fun to tell people about it (It's a cleaning simulator! No, yeah, just that! I swear it's fun!), and its funny to play, at least for a bit. I like the stark contrast between the boring day-to-day janitorial tone and the bloodstained sci fi scenery that you clean insestines off of.\n\nBut: I can't get past the fact that the actual game, where you actually spend hours just picking up giblets and scrubbing blood, is just as fun as cleaning is. And cleaning isn't fun—to me, at least.","December 27, 2014","false","3.0"," 21 of 35 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","21","35","0","0"

There is no way it can be fun.  If I wanted to clean I would get off my lazy butt and go clean my real house and get crap done."\n\nI was, thankfully mistaken.  VCD is fun if you have OCD, more or less.  It isn't the fact you are cleaning, it is /what/ you are cleaning.\n\nImagine back to days of old, where you are the awesome Doom Marine, ploughing through legions of space zombie demon things, all the satisfying shotgun cracks and blood and body parts flying thruogh the air.  Good times.  Now imagine the poor sod that comes in after to make the place functional again.  The one who drags each and every severed limb and dismembered body into an industrial grade furnace, mops up the blood, picks up every shell casing and makes it look good again.  Thats what VCD is, you are cleaning up after someone elses game.\n\nIn all honesty I was whole heartedly ready to write off VCD before even playing it.  However another game that I had bought and quite adored (Shadow Warrior) came with a free, stand alone, DLC for paying customers, VCD: Shadow Warrior.  I had heard of VCD by this time, and had disregaurded it entirely, but with a free copy I decided to give it a shot, I could always stop playing, and it was free.  This bit of marketing was totally ingenius of the developers, because I adored it.  A game I blew off, believed I would hate, I found I loved.  I further bought the other Stand alone Santa's Rampage game upon release.\n\nNow that the real version is here, I got to say I am really not disapointed.  It is as fun as ever, and I got to admit I have honestly found such few things than fully cleaning  a level and getting 'employee of the month' in game.  It is affordable and in all honesty if you are on the fence about buying it, I recomend Santa's Rampage, or if you have Shadow Warrior give the DLC a try.  If you bought Santa's Rampage or have the Shadow Warrior one you get a perma discount on VCD, if not this game comes with both of them upon buying, so, three games in one.  It is totally worth your time and money!\n\nThere are a few things that could be fixed:\n- A tutorial would be nice to tell people what to do and how to play (I had to look up a guide to find out how to Buff out bullet decals.)\n\n- The Punchout machine should let you know if the place is spotless or not before you clock out, much like in Santa's Rampage.\n\n- Arc Weilder should be a perminate carry like the mop.\n","August 30, 2014","true","22.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thesickboy/recommended/246900/","thesickboy","SickBoy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thesickboy/","483 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis is a fantastically unique game. I don't think I've ever seen anything like it, at least not to this extent... and that is a joyous thing to experience when so few unique ideas come to fruition these days. Sure, it may not be your cup of tea, but it's something that everyone *needs* to experience just to fill out their gaming opinions (after all, you can't know what you like until you try it).\n\nBecause of its uniqueness, there's nothing that can be compared to it, and thus a quick analogy is impossible for me to give. Overall, it is a terrific satisfaction, even if you don't ace your cleaning sessions (hell, even the 'rating' system is a thing of beauty). It's amazing to me that with so many gory, destructive shooters out there, it took until now for there to be one where you actually clean up the aftermath. Perhaps the concept seems weird, but it is so mesmerizing, therapeutic, and enjoyable that I can't really do anything other than scream "PLAY IT!".\n\nGraphics: Modern, acceptable in all regards. The mopping and 'tracking blood' systems in particular are very satisfying.\n\nSound: Quite nice, and useful in all its iterations. A few physics-related issues can cause a few minor annoyances, but overall very enjoyable.\n\nUI: Absolutely minimal (in that there isn't one), and integrated with in-game mechanics which is so satisfying there are few words to really portray it well enough. Look, I realize many games 'benefit' from having all kinds of UI spam all over the screen... but I'd be happy as a clam to never see another 4th-wall-breaking UI element in any game. Because of that blatant bias, the absolute lack of one in Viscera is a thing of beauty. Sure, it makes the game harder because you don't have some meter telling you when you're done, and sure you may wish the 'sniffer' tool was just a UI element... but come on... accept the universe, accept the challenge, and just enjoy not staring at text for once in your gaming career.\n\nDifficulty: Very hard, and much appreciated. You have no idea when you're done with a level, and I *love it*. Even when you finish a level, you're still only given a vague impression of how well you did (your success is narrated to you through news clippings in your office). This mechanic alone is something I have never considered, and have absolutely fallen in love it. Because you have no meters to tell you when you're done, you have to triple, quadruple, etc. check every nook and cranny to make sure you've done the best job possible. The game becomes a true testament to your observation skills and creative thinking.\n\nGameplay: Pretty much what it sounds like: you clean up a disaster area. Picking up chunks of body parts, incinerating them, fixing bullet holes, mopping up the copious amounts of blood... all the while making sure not to spill anything you've cleaned up or track more blood all over the place. It's a completely unique style, and so unbelievably satisfying for those of us OCD-inclined. If you enjoy mowing a lawn to perfection, seeing a vacuum leave a beautiful trail of reoriented carpet fibres, dusting a cabinet until nothing but shining wood/metal shows beneath, playing a game and destroying/talking-to/etc. everything you can: this game is for you. This is for those that appreciate and embrace obsession at its core. Picking up every bullet shell suddenly becomes a glorious past-time, and seeing a once completely trashed room at it's perfect cleanliness is unbelievably satisfying.\n\nMultiplayer: This is the only aspect I can't speak to. I prefer to play games solo, and have not played MP yet (nor do I plan to). I'm sure some enjoy it, but for me it would ruin the tranquil experience I've so far had.\n\n\nOverall: This game is a magnificently new pastime for me. When I want to chill out and feel productive, this is what I boot up. I am NOT the cleanest person you'll meet... in fact, I live like a rodent. But this game gives me an outlet to be as perfect as I can. Bugs exist (though I've only encountered two), but the developers seem on the ball with continuing to make this a fantastic experience upon full release.","July 2, 2014","true","8.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Well this game actually gives those objects a purpose, and the goal is to clean that ♥♥♥♥ up. The entire point of the game is to clean up bloody messes using your trusty mop and hands. At first I figured this would be quite the easy task; however, it can take a lot of time to clean everything up based on how ocd you can be. There are no clear instructions on how to clean ♥♥♥♥ up, and you learn by simply playing for a while. There are huge incinerators placed around the map where you can throw the body parts into, and Splosh-O-matics which dispenses buckets of water.\n\nhttps://farm6.staticflickr.com/5576/14561463657_e5b6f1d72f_b.jpg (splosh-O-matic & incinerators)\n\nThankfully the devs didn't limit how much buckets of water you can get out of the Splosh machine because you are constantly going to need to refill up on them. Like real life you can't just keep using the same bucket of water to clean beacuse after a while the water is just to become filthy. I had about 20 buckets placed in a corner at one time in order to just clean one small area. If you don't remember to dip your mop in water it will only lead to more blood/goo being spread about the place. Another little neat thing in the game is that you also leave behind bloody footprints each time you step into a blood pile. The jump feature is actually useful for avoiding those blood stains, so you don't end up tracking those footprints about the place. It definitely is quite the task to clean everything up in a room, but it is a clean up simulator after all.\n\nThe biggest gripe I have about the game so far is that the ragdoll physcis could certainly be a lot better. Also being able to throw the body parts would help instead of having to get as close as possible to the incinerators just to dump an arm in them. This game has a lot of potential to be great, and I've really enjoyed my time playing it. I certainly recommend this game to those who like to clean ♥♥♥♥ up.\n\n+ you get to clean ♥♥♥♥ up\n+ Takes a lot of time to clean (plus for me although may be a minus for others)\n+ great atmosphere\n\n- physics could be better\n- no in-game music (what janitor doesn't listen to music!)","July 27, 2014","true","11.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It's a great way to zone out or relax and just listen to a playlist. You get a sense of accomplishment out of it and the levels have character to them. Most of them have scattered bits of information telling a story about what happened to the area. Sometimes there are really hillarious hazards involved. Incredibly, co-op with 1-3 people seems not to make physics too ridiculous in a time when even AAA games can't manage or try to sync physics for all players. There are occasional issues but an early access game with this kind of physics sync (and de-sync, because it's hillarious to watch a bin of gibs pretty much explode and ruin a room) is impressive. I tend to play with 1 to 2 friends and we never really have issues with physics (although we do let the host carry the most packed bins just to make sure they behave). It's currently only direct-connect but it works for me. Seriously, get this.

Viscera Cleanup Detail puts you in the shoes of the janitor cleaning up after the protagonist. The game has some noticable dark humor, turning what would be a grim setting into a comedy trying to dislodge some poor sod's guts from the ceiling. If you think this is some gimmick game you'll play a little and set down after 5 minutes after the novelty wears off, think again. At least if you play the way I play, you'll find a solid hour of gameplay on a single map. If you've purchased Viscera Cleanup Detail: Santa's Rampage and enjoyed it, you'll find that you'll get 25% off the price of VCD as of 4/11/14. My only complaint is that it may get tedious after a while searching around for that last bloodstain or the last piece of meat left lying around. There are some bugs, but it is still in alpha, and you should expect this going into an Early Access game. There is multiplayer if you want to do some janitor cleanup with your friends, but be advised it has the old 'host/join' system and you'll have to type stuff on your keyboard instead of clicking on a server.\n'The Citizen Kane of simulators' - Derrick the homeless guy on the street","April 11, 2014","true","29.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

For me, its good, I rather like it! But there's no minigames, no easter eggs or hidden fun times. You are a janitor, and you clean. The co-op is something I like even more, having a second person makes it not only faster, but fun and more social. It's still pretty buggy even as far as early access goes, but its not game-breaking, midly annoying at most. As far as gameplay.. pretty polished actually. Movement is fluid (if youre not holding a crate, which can often bump around due to hitboxes of its contents.), and some tactics are actually needed if you dont want to mess areas you've already cleaned. Mechanics are pretty cool and getting progressively more in-depth, for instance if you walk through some blood you'll get it on your boots and track it for a certain period of time. All in all I personally like it but it's not for everyone who maybe has a shorter span of attention and won't want to wait around to see the job done.\n\nEDIT: Almost forgot price.

Blood and body parts (also called viscera) litter every part of the station, be it human or alien. Your main objective in this game is, of course, to clean the designated area of blood, gore, and casings. In your arsenal, you have a uber-absorbant mop, your hands, and a sniffer tool which helps find any mess you missed. You are also given a bucket dispenser and bin dispenser, which both can spew out mess at random times, causing you to rage. Also at your disposal is an incinerator where all your bins and dirty buckets are disposed of. Not only do you have to clean up the violence, you must tidy up, which includes not leaving trash, buckets, or bins, not leaving overturned barrels (people apparently die quite easily from these), and filling any wall-mounted medkits with new supplies. There are also bullet holes on the walls apart from everything else. To get rid of these, and prevent someone freaking out from them and breaking their neck, you need a plasma gun, which is located somewhere on the map. Watch out though, as overheating it causes it to create more mess. There is also very simple yet effective multiplayer, where you team up to take down the mess that plagues the station. I will admit this game has more than a few bugs, but this game is in early access, and updates bring many new additions and many needed bug fixes. This game, if u got the money, is definitely worth it, and besides, who wouldn't want to clean blood and gore in the middle of space?\n\n\n\n\ninfinite X infinite/10","May 23, 2014","true","36.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

In solo mode, you are completely alone.\n- Could use more bizarre, exotic locations, a la Santa's Rampage.  Industrial locations suck.\n- Needs more tools besides the mop and sniffer.  The brush and PDA are useless.\n- The laser welder was a bad addition.  Finding bullet holes to weld is VERY frustrating.\n- The office is a map with its own save file.  If you get fired, you cannot fix it by loading a save game.\n\nTips:\n- If you're an achievement collector, for heaven's sake, get the "You're Fired" achievement first!  If you get fired later in the game, you'll lose all the trophies in the office, which is a massive design flaw and a huge slap in the face.  No, you can't reload your game save and fix it.\n\n- You only need to clean a level 70% to return trophies to the office.  This can save a lot of time on replays.\n\n- You only get fired if you clock out.  If you can't clean the level properly, just choose the "Leave" option and you'll be fine.\n\n- Return every note from "Bob" to the office.  It sucks to burn them early in the game, only to find out LATER you were supposed to keep them, and you have to replay all the early levels again.\n\n- Run the game via Steam and choose 64-bit.  If run as 32-bit, the game is more likely to have problems.\n\n- Mop up blood first, then collect body parts.  Blood multiplies, not spreads, as you walk over it.\n\n- The office is much bigger than you think, so put in the effort to hack all the door locks.","December 6, 2015","true","374.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Despite the game being about cleaning, I didn't find it boring at all - rather, a great change of pace from what you typically are tasked with in a game. There is a sense of reward in seeing an area become sparkling clean, having just recently been covered in blood and limbs. There is a ton of content to be experienced here, including a level editor and two spin-off games, so it is definitely worth the price.

Although it has been in Early Access for a little over a year. It is updated regularly and they're always adding new maps. The game gives a completely new take on sci-fi and horror games, as the player must experience the horrors of picking up after the hero, rather than being the hero themselves.\n\nThe game also comes in two other, less updated versions, Viscera Cleanup Detail: Santa's Rampage and Viscera Cleanup Detail: Shadow Warrior.\n\nFor $9.99 you really can't beat getting three amazing games.\n\nWell, what are you waiting for?

Not even the most fearless of action heroes is ever seen taking the time to clean up after themselves, especially after their work is done and they've recieved their commemorations and free hookers. It is the critical job of the cleanup crew to do what the action hero does not. This game takes no time in reminding you just how miserable and thankless that job truly is.\n\nThere's no tutorial, no point system, and no time limit, so you figure out everything on your own at your own pace.\n\nOnce you understand your job and equipment, you learn to prioritize what needs to be done to keep the area clean.\n\nYou develop a system for eficiently removing the large array of blood, body parts, bullet casings, and other assorted trash from an area, all while maintaining cleanliness in previously cleaned areas.\n\nYou WILL make mistakes and your equipment WILL malfunction, causing more of a mess, but you will learn to accept it and move on because its all part of the job.\n\nYou will clean the area to the best of your ability and allow the previously bloodied, body-strewn, trash-filled area to once again shine with its original beauty.\n\nYou will clock out and return to your office, confident that you did your best.\n\nWhat will this get you? A top ranking in the leaderboards? A level up? An unlocked item? A large exciting trophy? Untold riches? Hookers and ice cream? At the very least, a celebratory beer round with your coworkers?\n\nNo.\n\nYou will return to your empty office and it will look just the same as any other day. Maybe if you did a good enough job you will be Employee of the Month, with a small picture framed on the wall. Maybe some newspaper clippings will commemorate (or condemn) the hard work that you did...but nothing more.\n\nNo celebration. No score. No beer round. No sexy ladies.

Well in this game, you play that poor prick. You're a space janitor and your job is simple: clean ♥♥♥♥ up.\n\nViscera Cleanup Detail is a terrific game for any gamer who is frankly a little bored of the formulaic crud that has saturated video games in recent years. The game is early access but the developer seems to never sleep and is constantly updating it at no extra charge, which is awesome.\n\nIt's physics engine is pretty damn impressive, especially when you consider that it's able to put stuff in bins without the elements spazzing out and flying around the room, as they often do in games. The details are top-notch and gameplay is fluid and easy to use. It's morbid sense of humour is great and the sound design is excellent. I never grow tired of hearing body parts squish as I drop them in the bin. VCD also has a hosting system so you can play with friends.\n\nThis game is fun and engaging and can be an excellent time-sink if you find yourself bored and have nothing to do. I personally like to put on a podcast and have a game while I listen.\n\nFor some, the game's novelty may wear thin, and in some cases it can get boring after a little while. But the game has its charm and is actually rather challenging considering that EVERYTHING is coated in blood. It really is a terrific experience and a nice break from the usual old, gimmicky clap-trap that video games seem to peddle to the masses these days. If you only like games where you run around shooting people or grinding about in MMOs, this game will probably bore you to tears. But if you're like me, and wanna try something new and different that's challenging and doesn't take itself entirely serious, give Viscera Cleanup Detail a play.","November 1, 2014","true","40.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

But once I picked up the game 2 years after my first encounter with the demo product, I was surprise to find a lot of changes from the source tech demo that I foundly played several times for, once again, some reason.\n\n-Gameplay(?): Now the gameplay in of itself is the curious thing that I still can't get over. A literal janitor simulation. Wow. Like, seriously, no joke, it boggled my mind back them when simulation games weren't oversaturated in the market that someone thought this was a good idea. But when I started playing the game, and opening up the level select, my first look was to the average length per level. Like holy cow, bro. 3 hours? 4?! I think even a modded level went straight to 5! It was rather daunting upon my initial solo-working as a lowly space janitor to discover the huge messes of gore and blood left for me to clean, the basic equipment given to fix it all, and the...collectables? This mechanic alone was the intriguing portion that kept me cleaning bit after bit of Gary's, Bobby's, Sam's and Mike's from the floor that the corpses were smeared into. Finding various items such as movie references, secret letters, gizmoes that were just more references, alien heads, and so on. It was oddly fitting for a janitor to keep what no one really wanted for himself, so the basic notion that I was being encouraged to grab them helped immerse me even more into the persona of this yellow hat gentleman (And woman, as I later found out in multiplayer).\n\n-Story(?!): To be quite honest, the side stories within the various levels that tend to reference movies that the incidents that created your job of the day poke at caught my eye as I kept playing the massive zones of pure blood and guts, without the glory. The main 'plot' of you being sent to these horrific scenarios finally ended to mop up the mess like nothing special even happened was a nice point that still impresses me with its basic delivery, via PDA or the initial Mission Briefing once you start on a level. Not that it was something grand and spetacular, but I feel the makers gave the idea of space janitoring a nice twist to the average game that would suddenly turn heel and throw you into a winding plot of schemes and surprises, and instead keeping it very mellow and calm with the steady work you have to commit to achieve a good score with your employers. They even threw in a mystery or two with what exactly happens on the levels, and even outside of them! (I do refer to the Bob story, which I won't get into here, since it's meant for you to figure out yourself!)\n\n-Glitches: Now this is mostly refering to my main play-time with my friend, who rather enjoys this game with even more infatuation than I. As we Co-Op'd our way throughout the levels, I notice occasional items suddenly falling into the void of below the floor, or into a wall, which dettered our ability to achieve perfect ratings after doing a good job with those side missions to boot (I'll touch on that next). Sometimes my game will get even worse, as moving simple boxes becomes a nightmare if the trash-box is filled up, the gore glitching itself to freedom, only to still be within the containment. Othertimes, the box will just feel like bouncing madly around for me, while my friend questions my sanity as I just hold a box in my hands. Even still, the glitches I listed and a few more minor bugs never dettered me from enjoying my experience, but should be listed non the less for sake of possible fixes. Especially the glitches where collecting NEEDED secret items to complete a side story (Bob in particular) kept dissapearing from the main office and trunk whenever we switched zones together, making it near impossible for us to actually reach our goal.\n\n-Complaints: The complaints here are more personal that technical, so do not look at the developers warily, or to me for honesty, because this is mostly opinion. I did not enjoy the fact that side missions within the level are mostly obscure, in the sense that it is never listed out for you in the OBJECTIVES tab of your PDA. Later on, my friend notified me that some levels we completed had little markings about the zones to inform you of some of the missions, but not all were so nicely informative as the jungle level, with the yellow zone pointing out where to put your barrels and boxes.\n\n-Weird Suggestion: As strange as this sounds, I actually suggest maybe putting in more story to the zones. Despite the more jump-in-and-work gameplay that is the main focus of this janitorial simulation, what little pages and notes they dropped in there kept me wanting to find more and more, even the ID tags telling me what unlucky soul I shoved into a bucket was today, and inspired me to collect each one in their memory, until my friend and I just gave up and tossed them into a hole. I believe AllShamNoWow puts it best in his video, about wanting to have a story basically be a re-telling of the events on the level, as the janitor simply cleans up the aftermath.\n\nConclusion!: In the end, after the daunting introduction of the game mechanics, the exploration of the various levels with my friend, finding the secrets and genuinely enjoying janitor work, before raging at the 50th bucket tipped over because I thought it was in the air flying madly, to the intrigueing stories on the side that I cannot complete with my friend, due to odd dissapearances of items after completely levels. All of this in conjunction leads me to finally say: This game is dope. Get it, learn it, love it, then clean it.

I'll try to justify why by debunking misconceptions you might have about this game from glancing at it.\n\n(Full disclosure: I've spent a lot of time on the forums, including with the developers)\n\nQ. Why would you play a game about cleaning stuff up?\n\nA. Well, obviously the setting provides a lot of leeway. The game's cleaning environments/notes heavily and deliberately reference movies like The Thing, Alien, Event Horizon, Robocop, Demolition Man... If you're a fan of 80's horror/sci-fi or just someone who likes somewhat older, cult classic movies in general you'll see numerous references that'll make you smile, though the game doesn't shove them in your face. Secondly, cleaning stuff up minus the physical strain is actually somewhat satisfying. This game is perfect for playing whilst listening to podcasts, audiobooks and similar stuff.\n\nQ. Isn't this some kind of memes-trash game like Goat Simulator?\n\nA. Oh lord no. Glitches are uncommon (There are a few the devs have deliberately kept in due to humorous value, but they are far from game-disruptive), the controls are nowhere near deliberately awkward, and almost all jokes are told via either the environment or via notes you find. The game's far more concerned with telling semi-parodical stories of old movies via its environment than mindlessly going "OH LOL THE GAME'S GLITCHING ISN'T THAT FUNNY BECAUSE THE GLITCHES ARE INTENTIONAL THEREFORE ALL COMEDY THAT MIGHT COME WITH GLITCHES IS INHERENTLY LOST LOL". I can see why people might get the conception that's the game's purpose, but it's wrong in every way. The game will screw you over with ridiculousness, but it's not a "Memes-trash" game.\n\nQ. Does this game have enough content?\n\nA. Even if you play every level only once, assuming you actually bother to clean the level and don't immediately exit (Yes, you can do that, and yes, you get heavily punished), you'll still get your money's worth. Each level varies vastly in length, but a full completion will take you several hours, guarenteed. Add full Steam Workshop compatability to the mix, and you've got a game that can last you eons.\n\nOf course, no game is free of flaws, so I think it'd be best if I warned of them:\n\n-There's no tutorial, so you'll have to rely on outside sources to learn how to play.\n-Multiplayer is very fun (And unlike singleplayer, very chaotic), but rather difficult to set up in comparison to a lot of other multiplayer games. If you're unfamiliar with setting up servers of your own via Hamachi and similar measures then you'll have issues with playing with your pals.\n-As I mentioned earlier, each level will most likely take you more than an hour. Of course, you can save and return later, but if you don't really have much time to play videogames generally the time investment will probably be too taxing for you.\n-As you should be able to tell from simply looking at it, this game ain't for everyone ;)","March 27","true","319.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

They lay on the beach listening to the waves, they rest their eyes while sitting beside a window being pelted with rain, or even run humming electronics like fans just for the sound. Viscera Cleanup Detail is the videogame version of white noise. A calming oasis in the midst of noisy bother.\n\nThere is something decidedly zen about cleansing a space station of all evidence of violence. You mop the blood, sweep the shells, burn the body parts, bin the trash, and restock the medkits. It scratches the OCD itch - you can have a place for everything and everything in its place. Besides that there's progression with your persistent janitor's office (as long as you don't get fired), hidden secret items and references to many games and films, a speed run mode, widely praised chaotic multiplayer, nice graphics and a small backstory about a mad custodian murderer. This game gives us a peek behind the curtain of the violent video game; the aftermath of encounters with aliens, robots, mutants (and surprisingly no zombies) has to be dealt with by someone, after all. There's a certain absurdist practicality to it all - because OF COURSE the evil corporation funding evil science would have an evil sanitation company with downtrodden working stiffs using hilariously dangerous and deadly equipment.\n\nHonestly, every violent game coming out ought to get a unique level just as Shadow Warrior did, perhaps with unique cleaning necessary. Clean up ripped and torn demonic guts in DOOM, incinerate dead Pyros in Team Fortress, that sort of thing. If this all sounds good to you, you should play Viscera Cleanup Detail!

The levels have predefined amounts of time for them because there is a goal (clean up the place), so you can pick how much time you want to destress. So when I'm in an awful mood, I will sometimes pick up a mop and clean up after the aliens or robots or genetic mutations have made a mess of this science station or that star ship.\n\nAnd my wife usually comes along so we can let off some steam bickering about the nasty messes we find... or even how badly the other is cleaning... or complaining when the other one knocks over our bloody bucket and makes a giant mess... or walks around the corner at the wrong time so we knock that chunk of alien out of their hands on accident, leaving a trail of blood as it bounces down the corridor that we will be responsible for cleaning up as well.\n\nThankfully, the developers have made quite a number of places to clean up.

So Viscera Cleanup Detail, or space janitor sim 2175, is a game where something has gone horribly wrong and you have to clean up after the hero came through messing up the place... you'll also have to clean up the hero, it was his first day being hero.\n\nLets start with the good; the graphics are on point, bearly and graphics glithes from what i experianced, in fact the game is really pretty. The music is 2000's sci-fi "future" music that plays from a "borrowable" item - You can "borrow" items, corpes, equipment and pids (personal ID). This game is immersive and quite fun to RP in and the physics are fun to play with - though a little glitchy at points.\n\n"This sounds pretty good, whats bad about it?" A few things actually, the gameplay itself, it gets repetitive and frankly somepeople don't have the patients for the slow and methodic prosess that you have to go through to get 100% on a level.\n\nIts not for everyone, and once you've played your fill of it the game can be hard to get back into, for example I did an achivment where you had to get some certain items from levels and take them to another level for secret collectables and it took hours, after that im having trouble finishing a level. This game really split me; do I like it or not? Honestly I liked it while it lasted, unfortunatly it didn't last long.","May 22","true","74.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Instead, we were unloaded in a creepy, isolated spaceship, the lights flickered, the walls and floor painted in blood, it looked like someone held a sexy yet brutal blood orgy! We are still getting paid, but is it worth it? I keep knocking the damn bucket over, sometimes I make more mess than I clean and someone painted the words 'Were Doomed' in blood! Is this some kind of kinky role play? Suddenly the thought of a simple blood orgy didn't seem to stick anymore. I began to feel sick, although the initial blood splatters, mettallic smell and the thought of bloody banging made me hot, it was way beyond that. My chubby went soft and I began cleaning. I've been working for just over an hour, I don't really mind it anymore, I feel comfortable in my new role. Some guy was killed though, his name was G Mann, I heard about him, apparently he was an odd guy, hard to understand and was good at disappearing. His body went missing from the morgue, my co-workers are making up some crazy conspiracy theories, one of them handed a photo of him to me, just in case someone found his body or something. Soon after I left the lunch area, I was walking back to my office, mentally preparing for the sexual onslaught my booty was about to endure, I walked around the corner towards my quarters and... I swear I saw Mr. G Mann, if it was really him, he was creepy, kind of cute, looked like him, pale guy with a suitcase, my chubby grew in to a raging dong as I stared at his gleaming, flawless skin, he straightened up his tie and concealed his exposed veiny appendage with a pull of his zip and walked off before I got a word out, my noo noo recoiled into the soft embrace of my underbelly, and I retired to my office to finish myself off with the sandpaper I keep in the locker, it is relaxing by the way. I also like to put the hard hats in my butt hole and plop them out on the ground, applying a brown finish to the already yellow colour, I consider myself a magician of sorts, I can fart in my own mouth and I don't think anyone else in the VCD can swallow the entire girth of a mop, a couple of my co-workers tried but failed, they both lined up to recieve their punishment, they would've rather sucked on one the dead aliens, but it was my bet and they lost ;)  I am apart of the Viscera Cleanup Detail, cleaning a bloody orgy pile near you.

It's simple, you clean up after horrific sci-fi related events/accidents which involves everything from mopping up blood with your sausage fingers looking mop ends, picking up and then incinerating various human and alien viscera and parts, disposing of various trash like soda cans or potato chip bags, disposing of shell casings leftover from gunfire, repair bullet holes in the walls, restock medical supply kits at appropriate wall stations, dispose of medical waste containers, and even replace toilet seats if there happens to be a restroom in the level you're playing. The amount of work when you first realize all of it can feel pretty overwhelming but luckily there is multiplayer which I will mention later. This is definitely a game for the patient gamer if you plan to actually get the task at hand done but you could always just see how damn dirty you could get the place. Sometimes the body parts are a little difficult to get into the biohazard bins and going up stairs with said bins isn't the easiest task either, I fixed that problem slightly by disabling bob under the settings which basically smooths out the walking animation. This is purely a personal thing but the fact that the alien blood is greenish in appearance (I only say aliens because of some of the body parts I've seen) opens up the possibility to imagine maybe it was a zombie outbreak in some facility and I suppose even the alien body parts could be Resident Evilesque Umbrella experiments. The multiplayer adds another level of fun and excitement you can experience with your friends although it is sometimes buggy as hell at the moment; invisible friends, buckets/bins not dispensing, filthy rooms looking completely clean, etc... They do mention the multiplayer is in the works though so I can't wait for it to be more stable. Overall I've thoroughly enjoyed my initial experience with Viscera Cleanup Detail from knocking over buckets full of bloody water, toppling over bins full of body parts, and obsessively checking for anything I may have missed I would definitely give it an 8.5/10.","April 6, 2014","true","12.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The goal of the game is to mop up blood, clean up and burn body parts, shell casing, and other bits of evidence, and leave the place spotless and shiny like there never was the horrible slaughter of a dozen space marines by unknown extraterrestrial monstrosities.\n\n\nLet's start with the bad of this game, and of that there are two major problems: the physics system and the content (or lack there of).\n\nThe physics system is your standard, sterotypical buggy and awful physics system. Often times objects will bounce unrealistically, get stuck in walls, phase through walls of the bucket, and send you jumping in the air like it was spring loaded. It is also impossible to right a box if it gets knocked over, you have to get a new one. Given how much of the game revolves around the physics system (mainly by placing little bits of bodies in boxes to bring back to the furnace) this is a major problem. The physics system has caused me a lot of frustration and hinders its enjoyability.\n\nThe second and more serious problem is the lack of content in this game. Yes, there are a couple dozen maps with different things to clean up (usually varying in the alien bodies). But after 30 minutes of playing the game you've done all that the game has to offer, the rest is just more of that. This might not have been too bad if the game didn't feel like such a chore. Granted, I assume feeling like a chore was intended, you are a janitor after all, but that doesn't make it any less tedious. The physics system is also a large part of this chore, and when half of your gameplay that is very repetitive is poorly done you have a major problem with enjoyability.\n\n\nThe good in this game is that the mopping up part of the game does work rather well. Mopping up blood and washing your mop in buckets is well implemented (if a bit repetitive as stated prior). The fact that splashing body parts against the wall makes blood stains and that walking in blood will leave bloody footprints is a nice attention to detail. It is also very satisfying to complete a level and look back over all the work you've done, similar to the satisfaction of writing a long essay or doing the dishes.\n\nThe problem is that the game is very shallow and what it does offer isn't that enjoyable.\nThe only saving grace for this game is that it is a great podcast game. That is, it's perfect for something to do idly in the background while listening to a podcast or a TV show or the like. However on its own the game falls flat.\n\n\nMy final verdict would be this:\nThe game is very shallow and repetitive and simple, so I would recommend not buying it.\nHowever, this game can be useful as something to do idly while listening to a podcast, but even then I would recommend other podcast games with a bit more to offer, such as Elite Dangerous, over this.","April 16","false","2.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

It's still in the early stages so can be a bit buggy at times (which I find quite funny if I'm honest) but other players may find frustrating. You get a good sense of satisfaction when you clean an area and don't leave bloody footprints all over the floor.\nThe only downside is that there isn't a clear idea of your progression as to how clean it is. I'm not talking about a factual percentage, because you wouldn't have that in real-life, but maybe a description of your efforts and if there were any consequences.\nMy friends and I all decided that an experience based ranking system would be awesome and add a bit of fun aswell. Like, if I was a supervisor and my friend was a rookie, I could tell him what to do and just say he has to do it because I'm in charge.\nAll in all a good game, just needs a few extra bits and it's well on it's way to being popular.","January 2, 2015","true","2.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

My job there was to clean the reserve officer school and it's living quarters which was in total, about 4 buildings large. My work there started rather nicely, the coworkers were really kind and my boss was pretty cool too, little did i know that this wasn't going to last for long.\n\nYou see, the officers were having a summer break while i was there, which meant that the school was closed and all the living quarters were completely empty. This of course meant that there was not going to be any dirt to clean since the whole place was completely abandoned for the rest of my month long stay.\n\nNothing, and i do mean NOTHING, is worse than having to clean up a place that you've already cleaned crystal clean the last day. And you cant even slack off since it's an army base and there are people monitoring your doings over the security cameras!\n\nHow does this have anything to do with Viscera Cleanup Detail? You might ask.\n\nLet me tell you, the month i spent in that reserve hellhole was probably the most dull i've ever had. The one and only thing i really wished for (Excluding the fact that i basically knew nobody in the town, so i had little to no social contacts.) was to have something to actually clean.\n\nThen one day i found this game, and it's just what i wished for. You have so much to clean that you'll be spending hours upon hours just trying to make every single last spot so clean that you can see your own image in it.\n\nI dont know if the devs are really all that invested in the game as a "Real Product" or just treating it something people find silly and make YouTube videos about, but i personally enjoy it very much since i can live my childhood dream of actually doing something worthwhile for my money.\n\nGiblets, tasty giblets... ~","July 28, 2014","true","0.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"A game about cleaning? Why would I ever play that?" But duct tape them to a chair and force them to try it once and they'll understand. This game is extremely addicting and brings out either the perfectionists or devils in anyone. For an alpha release, the visuals are stunning. The models and lighting are realistic, but this also comes at the cost of computing power. The physics work pretty well, but they can get a little freaky in multiplayer, sometimes with humorous results. Speaking of multiplayer, it's one point where this game really shines. It's much more fun working with your friends to finish the task, or being that one guy who spills the bloody buckets and doesn't tell anyone.

As a reminder to those who believe in a brighter future for all, this game is a solem reminder that even in the 22nd century, we're still going to need janitors. After all, who's left to clean up the messes left behind by the steroid addled space soldiers but the poor janitor?\n\nYour tools for the job are deeply inadequate, given that you've got a mop, a barely function grime scanner, and your own two hands. Assisting you are a few pieces of recklessly malfunctioning equipment that will ocassionally dispense bits of of your fellow humans rather than the useful buckets and biohazard bins required to cart their remains. Add to the that the problem of your own footprints tracking blood and bile, and the game becomes an exercise in playing catch up as your previously sparkling rooms once again become horror shows.\n\nViscera Cleanup Detail is the sort of game that gives you that sort of smug, self punshing joy that you get from completing a task that is both meaningless, yet somehow compelling. Much like Tetris, your errors pile up and your acomplishments disappear. In addition to recieving absolutely no reward for a job well done, any stray casing, bullet hole, or partially dismembered corpse leaves you with a snarky note in your office about how how badly you've failed.\n\nAll that said, you may better spend your time doing something else. In the two plus hours it takes you to complete the first level, you could clean your entire house and get the satisfaction of a job well done, as well as the fact that you won't be deeply embarrased by unexpected guests. But if you are a masochist, and you enjoy tedious, unrewarding gameplay for the sake of completion, than this is the game for you.","April 11, 2014","true","5.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

My job there was to clean the reserve officer school and it's living quarters which was in total, about 4 buildings large. My work there started rather nicely, the coworkers were really kind and my boss was pretty cool too, little did i know that this wasn't going to last for long.\n\nYou see, the officers were having a summer break while i was there, which meant that the school was closed and all the living quarters were completely empty. This of course meant that there was not going to be any dirt to clean since the whole place was completely abandoned for the rest of my month long stay.\n\nNothing, and i do mean NOTHING, is worse than having to clean up a place that you've already cleaned crystal clean the last day. And you cant even slack off since it's an army base and there are people monitoring your doings over the security cameras!\n\nHow does this have anything to do with Viscera Cleanup Detail? You might ask.\n\nLet me tell you, the month i spent in that reserve hellhole was probably the most dull i've ever had. The one and only thing i really wished for (Excluding the fact that i basically knew nobody in the town, so i had little to no social contacts.) was to have something to actually clean.\n\nThen one day i found this game, and it's just what i wished for. You have so much to clean that you'll be spending hours upon hours just trying to make every single last spot so clean that you can see your own image in it.\n\nI dont know if the devs are really all that invested in the game as a "Real Product" or just treating it something people find silly and make YouTube videos about, but i personally enjoy it very much since i can live my childhood dream of actually doing something worthwhile for my money.\n\nGiblets, tasty giblets... ~","July 28, 2014","true","0.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As a reminder to those who believe in a brighter future for all, this game is a solem reminder that even in the 22nd century, we're still going to need janitors. After all, who's left to clean up the messes left behind by the steroid addled space soldiers but the poor janitor?\n\nYour tools for the job are deeply inadequate, given that you've got a mop, a barely function grime scanner, and your own two hands. Assisting you are a few pieces of recklessly malfunctioning equipment that will ocassionally dispense bits of of your fellow humans rather than the useful buckets and biohazard bins required to cart their remains. Add to the that the problem of your own footprints tracking blood and bile, and the game becomes an exercise in playing catch up as your previously sparkling rooms once again become horror shows.\n\nViscera Cleanup Detail is the sort of game that gives you that sort of smug, self punshing joy that you get from completing a task that is both meaningless, yet somehow compelling. Much like Tetris, your errors pile up and your acomplishments disappear. In addition to recieving absolutely no reward for a job well done, any stray casing, bullet hole, or partially dismembered corpse leaves you with a snarky note in your office about how how badly you've failed.\n\nAll that said, you may better spend your time doing something else. In the two plus hours it takes you to complete the first level, you could clean your entire house and get the satisfaction of a job well done, as well as the fact that you won't be deeply embarrased by unexpected guests. But if you are a masochist, and you enjoy tedious, unrewarding gameplay for the sake of completion, than this is the game for you.","April 11, 2014","true","5.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Well. Viscera Corp janitors come and clean up the mess left behind. If I knew I'll be the guy with the mop and the bucket, I wouldn't made so much mess. I regret now I didn't use blunt weapons more often. Or did not kite all mobs to the same corner and killed them there.\n\n\n\nOkay, even though the game is very nice and entertaining - so I recommend it, here are some negatives you should consider before you buy:\n\n1. After more than a year(!) the game is still early access and v0.49. The good news is, though, there are updates time to time so it's not an abandonware, just the development is slow ('RuneStorm' released another game in the mean time this one was and is still in early access...).\n\n2. Still a lot more content to add, even for core items and still many defects(bug) floating around (odor meter ticks in sometimes on 100% clean areas, but not always detects dirty corners, so I was not able to hand in a 100% job in my 7.2 hours play time; on 2nd map, there are huge lag spikes/fps drops in single player so the map is buggy; lighting can go silly and basically, maps are too dark -for me-; very rarely, but sometimes body parts get stuck -in the ground- so cannot be lifted up but "slided" only on ground-level, so cannot be burned away -I had to start over a map one time because of that, not even save/quit/restart fixes-, etc)\n\n3. You won't feel like you are "progressing", you are just doing one map after the other: there are no gear upgrades, character development or map specialties (e.g. areas on a map where a gas mask is a must or very slippy ground, etc), the items you collect are for nothing (i.e. pointless collecting anything), can't see any story going on behind (like an investigation "mini game" from items and hints collected to figure out what exactly happened in the compound, or anything like that), etc.\nSo even though I'm sure I'll play more with this game (review at: 7.2hrs play time) I'm also sure I'm gonna get bored fairly quickly.\n","June 21, 2015","true","11.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

After playing for like an hour you quit out of boredom and probably never  play again. The game should have goals, some nice background music, and some other maps :P. But its still pretty fun for just being an early access game. I just hope some of the stuff I recommend gets added to the game to make players wanna play longer.

Mop to blood, mop to bucket, bucket to fire. Over and over again. 'Fun' is not something you will find in this game, but after bucket after bucket, you find yourself mesmerised and enthralled by the repetition of the experience. As you delve deeper into madness (and yes, you are mad for playing this game, mad or stupid) you will take up trophies and prizes, human head, alien heads, strange notes, seeds, spores and anything that looks remotely interesting you will end up stuffing in that blue box that keeps closing when you try and move it.\n\nAt the end of a massacre, you will find yourself mourning over the dead bodies that you are shovelling into an inferno. You will recover notes and letters that could possibly belong to the corpse that you just threw into the fire. You cannot help him, he is lost, so you take his head and shove it into your blue box, maybe he will be remembered by sitting alongside all the other identical heads on your desk at the office, sitting right next to the head of the alien he slaughtered.\n\nNever has a game made me do the most boring thing in the world without any sort of reward.

A friend got this as a joke, streamed it, we had a good laugh, then he sent me a copy.  It's turned into something similar to Train Simulator for us, but I still managed to get almost 5 hours in this.  You're a space janitor in a space location cleaning up gibs, both human and alien, with it being implied that the "Heroes" have already been through and killed everything that needed killing, as evidenced by the spent shells and casings everywhere.  The physics are wonky, and every time you knock over your bucket full of blood, a piece of your soul will shrivel up and die.  Still, it's strangely entertaining, especially for those of us with a compulsive need to complete things.  I think everyone should buy this when it's on sale and try to complete just one level.

Well. Viscera Corp janitors come and clean up the mess left behind. If I knew I'll be the guy with the mop and the bucket, I wouldn't made so much mess. I regret now I didn't use blunt weapons more often. Or did not kite all mobs to the same corner and killed them there.\n\n\n\nOkay, even though the game is very nice and entertaining - so I recommend it, here are some negatives you should consider before you buy:\n\n1. After more than a year(!) the game is still early access and v0.49. The good news is, though, there are updates time to time so it's not an abandonware, just the development is slow ('RuneStorm' released another game in the mean time this one was and is still in early access...).\n\n2. Still a lot more content to add, even for core items and still many defects(bug) floating around (odor meter ticks in sometimes on 100% clean areas, but not always detects dirty corners, so I was not able to hand in a 100% job in my 7.2 hours play time; on 2nd map, there are huge lag spikes/fps drops in single player so the map is buggy; lighting can go silly and basically, maps are too dark -for me-; very rarely, but sometimes body parts get stuck -in the ground- so cannot be lifted up but "slided" only on ground-level, so cannot be burned away -I had to start over a map one time because of that, not even save/quit/restart fixes-, etc)\n\n3. You won't feel like you are "progressing", you are just doing one map after the other: there are no gear upgrades, character development or map specialties (e.g. areas on a map where a gas mask is a must or very slippy ground, etc), the items you collect are for nothing (i.e. pointless collecting anything), can't see any story going on behind (like an investigation "mini game" from items and hints collected to figure out what exactly happened in the compound, or anything like that), etc.\nSo even though I'm sure I'll play more with this game (review at: 7.2hrs play time) I'm also sure I'm gonna get bored fairly quickly.\n","June 21, 2015","true","11.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There's no shooting (except for repairing bullet-holes in walls with a welder gun) nor are there any NPCs. If spending several hours cleaning a virtual environment doesn't sound appealing to you, you probably won't enjoy this game.\nThat being said, I had quite a bit of fun cleaning up a few maps and spending hours tidying up a virtual environment that could have easily been invested in cleaning my own house. It's a quirky game and is quite enjoyable if you have the right mindset for it.\nNote: I also hear that there's a multiplayer mode which is quite entertaining as well, althogh I haven't been able to experience it because all my friends think it's stupid.","March 4, 2015","true","17.2"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

I still play this game and have loved every moment of it. This game is loaded with fun and unique maps. Each one has it's own theme and level of mess to clean up. With the workshop maps that are being made and the Devs working on new maps you will find lots of places to explore and clean up. Multiplayer makes the game even better. You can have fun trolling some friends by making a bigger mess, or work together and try to get a map spotless.\n\nSure the games has it's share of a few bugs but then again no game is ever bug free. With that said some of the random bugs are more amusing then annoying. Some of the bugs many have considered them as features more then anything else. If you want to see some of the random yet funny things that has happened in this game even back during the old beta days just look at the screenshots and artwork sections on Steam, I'm sure something will make you smile.\n\nWith all of that said I highly recommend this game, because cleaning has never been this fun.","February 28","true","100.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As you delve deeper into madness (and yes, you are mad for playing this game, mad or stupid) you will take up trophies and prizes, human head, alien heads, strange notes, seeds, spores and anything that looks remotely interesting you will end up stuffing in that blue box that keeps closing when you try and move it.\n\nAt the end of a massacre, you will find yourself mourning over the dead bodies that you are shovelling into an inferno.

I still play this game and have loved every moment of it. This game is loaded with fun and unique maps. Each one has it's own theme and level of mess to clean up. With the workshop maps that are being made and the Devs working on new maps you will find lots of places to explore and clean up. Multiplayer makes the game even better. You can have fun trolling some friends by making a bigger mess, or work together and try to get a map spotless.\n\nSure the games has it's share of a few bugs but then again no game is ever bug free. With that said some of the random bugs are more amusing then annoying. Some of the bugs many have considered them as features more then anything else. If you want to see some of the random yet funny things that has happened in this game even back during the old beta days just look at the screenshots and artwork sections on Steam, I'm sure something will make you smile.\n\nWith all of that said I highly recommend this game, because cleaning has never been this fun.","February 28","true","100.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You probally think that that is disgusting, but it's actually quite interessting. I personally discovered this game by a video of Nerd³. Since then I played this game for 28 hours already and I love it. It has funny bits and pieces and also some story in every map. For people who are new to this game should definitly ask someone to get them started (like me). The game does not have a tutorial and that's one of the things that makes this game a bit less likeable, but as always someone made a tutorial level on the steam workshop to get you started.\n\nThe maps on this game go from 45 mnutes of playtime to 3 HOURS of playtime and the sizes go from small to huge. Most maps have around 1-2 hours of playtime wich is long you may think but once you play the game you won't even notice (I've done 5 hours straight without noticing.).\n\nA far as mechanics go there is not too much special. Only some tools and machines that appear in every level. Some tools are level specific. There are also secondary objectives that won't influence your score. The controls are quite easy, just WASD and mouse buttons (or xbox 360 controls).\n\nAs far as multiplayer goes there are  few options:splitscreen co-op for wich you need to be on the pc and need two xbox 360 controllers. Then you have multiplayer server for up to 28 people (not recommended though). The servers are not paid or don't require any difficult set-up things to do but are a bit slow sometimes. For the multiplayer servers you can make them public or friends only wich comes in handy when you're trying to do a speedrun or so.\n\nFor VCD I would give a 9/10. I hope you found this helpful and thanks for reading. Regards, Spider.","March 3","true","52.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

There's no shooting (except for repairing bullet-holes in walls with a welder gun) nor are there any NPCs. If spending several hours cleaning a virtual environment doesn't sound appealing to you, you probably won't enjoy this game.\nThat being said, I had quite a bit of fun cleaning up a few maps and spending hours tidying up a virtual environment that could have easily been invested in cleaning my own house. It's a quirky game and is quite enjoyable if you have the right mindset for it.\nNote: I also hear that there's a multiplayer mode which is quite entertaining as well, althogh I haven't been able to experience it because all my friends think it's stupid.","March 4, 2015","true","17.2"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Be careful, if you don't clean up your mop, it becomes a paint brush. Find the super soaker incendiary gun to cauterize fleshy bits, remove bullet holes, and create sweet rave parties.\n\n---\nI recommend this game for a group of 3-4 people who are looking for a comical time. Viscera Cleanup Detail likes to mess with you, by dispensing limbs and guts instead of waste bins and buckets. Work together to clean the map up. This may require different roles, like the incendiary/waste guy, the cleaner, the sniffer, or the runner (runs buckets and waste bins back and forth).\n---\n\nI would like to see some challenges in the game. Maybe a time trial run might be fun. That would force the players to work together in the fastest and most organized manner possible.","July 25, 2014","true","11.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Yes this is a simulator game, yes being a janitor is only about cleaning(and making a mess by accident or on purpose! XD), but why can this game still be fun? Well from my point of view being one who likes bloody shooting games and such, then this game is one big ironic joke.

No, because the negative reviews are right, this game becomes repetitive which is why I would recommend this game for anyone who does not need to complete a game as quick as possible. Because this game for me is a way of relaxing(yeah I know, Ironic maybe even psychopatic XD) and cleaning a map here and there when you feel like it and not in one run.

You can either work or make a bigger mess if you like. The community isn't toxic at all either which is brilliant. You get a office where you can store objects you find from maps that you work in and dont get fired in that you can bring to other maps. This game is filled with referenced objects like the crowbar and gordons glasses from HL, the facehugger from Alien, and the shotgun from Doom, that you can also keep as a collection in your office. There's not that many levels but still fun to play over a couple of times. Extremely fun to play with friends when they dont ♥♥♥♥ everything up, something like making a bigger mess when your cleaning or, lobbing some tntnades at you also making a bigger mess.

Be careful, if you don't clean up your mop, it becomes a paint brush. Find the super soaker incendiary gun to cauterize fleshy bits, remove bullet holes, and create sweet rave parties.\n\n---\nI recommend this game for a group of 3-4 people who are looking for a comical time. Viscera Cleanup Detail likes to mess with you, by dispensing limbs and guts instead of waste bins and buckets. Work together to clean the map up. This may require different roles, like the incendiary/waste guy, the cleaner, the sniffer, or the runner (runs buckets and waste bins back and forth).\n---\n\nI would like to see some challenges in the game. Maybe a time trial run might be fun.

While the missions are repatative and a bit dull solo, this game is a little entertaining.  Puzzles are as complex as the tower of hanoi puzzle.  Storyline could use some work to, maybe a campaign with a narrative if a sequal is made; or maybe even verman control.  As it with the length of time it takes to complete each map it would probably be more fun as using the LAN multiplayer.","April 12","true","12.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

They make good use of the plasma welder to weld tracks left from the big robots and to weld bullet holes.\n\nAs you explore the station you find papers that say different things, I found a paper about a man who did, explicit things, with a robot.

This game is fun! Why? It's actually ... a game! I'll admit this is a hate it or get sucked into it title. Like in my case for example I found myself taking a quick look at the mess and just getting the kneejerk reflex of starting to clean up right away. If you get into it enough you'll find yourself having fun especially with the ridiculous nature of what you're cleaning and how you go about it. Soon enough I personally found myself watching out not to trail bloody foosteps behind me, obsessively washing every corner one at a time, strategizing with the buckets, etc. It is what it is... and it's a game; if it sucks you in, you'll be having fun!\n\nNot counted here is the time spent in the Santa's Rampage version which is where I really started actually trying to get the damn place clean. Prior to this I did some time in the space stations and before that, a quick first impressions video in which I quickly leaned all the difficult aspects of this game: http://www.interleave-vr.com/youtube-proper-player.php?v=HFPPPydWs0I (Link to a YouTube Flash player, required for watching my video format)\n\nMy only complaint? If this is to go for a story type flow, it should begin with much smaller areas to clean up. Levels around the order of 1-2hrs, then bring up the bar. Having the messes progressively revealed to us would be even more shocikng and having shorter areas to start with would give more feeling of progress.\n\nSuggestons I'd like to make are this: A bag or dust pan item that could allow us to pick up multiple small objects in one swoop instead of going one by one. Next a highlight on the item that will be picked up if the player clicks. Last but not least this game could actually benefit of a basic investigative aspect. You can't help but wonder what the hell happened in these stations and start speculating. A backstory with elements to progressively reveal it... as simple as possible... would be cool.","April 11, 2014","true","5.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I feel that the game would be more fun if not for the obnoxious things that draw out the job. It's also incredibly difficult to determine what is and isn't clean, meaning that when you finish you have likely missed a spot and you'll drive yourself crazy trying to figure otu where.

Perhaps change it so interacting with the door would give you this option?\n\n-"Zero-G Therapy" level imcomplete with a door that opens and closes with no immediate effect\n\n-The sniffer device is useful for detecting messes and objects that need disposing/cleaning but a separate switch should be implemented for sniffing out dirty buckets and disposable bins to avoid frustration and confusion as i had to get rid of those buckets and bins nearby when I wanted to find a particular mess/object when those aforementioned tools could still be used.\n\n-Most of the levels require the use of the welder gun so I found it unintuitive that it had to be thrown aside everytime you wanted to switch to your hands or mop rather than being on person at all times like the aforementioned tools.\n\n-In it's current build, there can be some texture tears in some levels such as above door ways in "Evil Science" but these are the exceptions rather than the norm.\n\n-When the bin is overloaded with objects, the physics can cause the objects to smash and bounce around each other impractically which can result in some objects actually popping outside the bin.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\nFurther Possible Improvements\n\n-Use of both hands when picking up small items, I can't tell you how tedious it gets when you're picking up the 15th bullet case in a level, one at a time, when you KNOW you have another hand free that can pick up another but instead it's just dangling in front of your face uselessly.\n\nThe vendors that give you your buckets and bins has an in game script that drops giblets semi-randomly when you use them. Funny for the first few times. Not so after that, especially when you're trying to do your job quickly. If the script would just end after the first few times or have the option to turn off/on, would help eliminate this point of frustration.\n\n*Edit*Although frustrating and non-sensical, this is a feature to add more difficulty to the game apparently so probably won't be changed in future.\n\n-The sniffer works just fine as it is at the moment but if another icon could be added to show you the current position of the object its detecting in regards to your altitude that would really help out especially in hard to reach places so you don't end up spending significant time looking in the wrong place which can add to player frustration.\n\nI've come close to quitting a level because the sniffer was picking up a object/mess that i just could not find despite spending 10-20 minutes looking in the approximate area.\n\nAlternatively, have the sniffer react to where the camera cursor is pointing at so it bleeps faster as the player's cursor is getting closer to the object it's detecting.\n\n- Implementing another mode to the sniffer so dirty buckets and bins are seperate things to be detected\n\n-I like how they added the function of having to replace supplies in certain levels, this could be extended even further by maybe having to replace light sources as well?\n\n-Make the toilets flushable in "Evil Science" level!\n\n-Achievements\n\n-Add interactivity to the office door so it offers option to choose another level or exit to main menu.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nReviewing this game was difficult since some of the points I raised, someone else may argue is what adds to the gameplay however as these are points that were reached only after extensive play throughs, I do feel they warrant some consideration.\n\nOverall though, I really like this game, there's a certain therapeutic feeling to cleaning all the muck and gunk that a level comes loaded with and you get a certain satisfaction when you feel you cleaned up a area nicely.\n\nTruly one of a kind game. Plays very well in its current build and with a few additions would make for a great game.\n\nWould currently highly recommend for those looking for something different.\n\n06.03.14 (MM/DD/YY)\n\n*Edit*\n\n07.03.14\n\n1. Changed point about the sniffer modes as the pinned thread explains the first two functions which i reprimanded\n\n2. After reading the pinned thread, seems the vendor special feature is an intentional feature not to be changed, previous point about vendor's changed to reflect that.","April 6, 2014","true","15.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

A lot of dust. That is what I call irony.\n\nAnyway, about this game:\n\nYou are a janitor which job it is to clean up a mess in a space-station caused by one of various reasons. Wheter a virus turns half the crew into zombies, the ship is invaded by aliens or some other reason you can think of, if you watched a lot of spacemarine-ish movies.\n\nBasically, it is really simple you can either do your job as you are supposed to do or you just screw around with the equippement you have. Either collect all the body parts or play basketball with them. Scrub away all the blood or splash it against the wall to make some bloody good art.\n\nThere is no real goal in this game, not even a rating in the classic way. You can end your work at any given time when you activate a control panel at the station. This teleports you back in your janitor-room and some pieces of paper scattered around in that room will tell you if you did a good job or not.\n\nThe biggest complaint I have about this game is pretty much that it throws you in, without telling you anything you are able to do. I mean, I know it is a game which only rule is, that it has no rules, but i would really like to know what my character is able to do. You really have to find out everything yourself from scratch, some people might like that but a bit assitance in that case would be welcome.\n\nFor example, your mainweapon the scrubber tool. It turns bloody red after a few swipes over the dirty floor and in that state, instead of cleaning you just smear the blood around. Alright, you will think. The scrubber needs a cleaning itself. But how? Bashing it around with the secondary move does nothing but make the mess even bigger. Eventually you will find a waterbowl-dispenser and get the idea. Dip it in and *bling* as good as new. Now the real cleaning can begin. You carry that bowl with you, put it down, dip the scrubber in clean up, rinse and repeat.\n\nNow you will notice other things like body parts will never stop producing blood when coming in contact with anything so you need to find a way to dispose them. Or the water in your bowl starts turning red, and it won't clean your scrubber after dipping it in. Or what in the name of Odin is this device on your 3rd slot that keeps on beeping whatever you are doing?\nThings like these made this game a bit more frustrating than it had to be. I really like to see a creative tutorial for this game, just like in Surgeon Simulator 2013 which has shown you how to actually beat the next operation by putting a floppy-disc in the computer.\n\nAll in all:\nIt is a game to waste your time. If you have nothing better to do, you can play this. It can be really atmospheric from time to time, when you look around at the mangled corpses, blood on the wall that reads "HELP" or "DOOMED". It is still in alpha so I look forward to updates. The price was a bit too much.\n\nI give this game a total of 6 out of 10 Karmapoints, marking it as "Check it out when you have over 40 bucks on your Steam-account left anyway"\n","April 5, 2014","true","22.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
