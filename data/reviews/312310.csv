The controls are meh.  Resolution cannot be adjusted.  Keybinds and controls cannot be adjusted.\n\nThe developer put this on Steam November 13, 2014, knowing full well he is NOT working on it and it is NOT being developed.\n\nValve should be held responsible for this level of fraud.  The developer stopped work on this project and admitted as much as far back as Mar 8 2013, 3:08pm (1 year 8 months before Valve allowed it to be put up).\nLink to developer stating the game was no longer being developed (March 8, 2013):\nhttp://www.desura.com/games/ensign-1/forum/thread/i-work-for-filament-now\nAnd the developer's full comment history on Desura:\nhttp://www.desura.com/members/onionman/comments\n\nSteamDB history for all the builds, changes, etc (notice a distinct lack of new builds):\nhttps://steamdb.info/app/312310/history/\n\n--\n6 months and the author has not even responded to support requests, or posts here on Steam, or on Desura.\n\nhttp://www.desura.com/games/ensign-1/forum/board/general-discussion\nhttp://www.desura.com/games/ensign-1/forum/thread/onionman-will-there-be-any-further-updates-to-this-game1\n\nhttp://www.desura.com/games/ensign-1/forum/board/support\nhttp://www.desura.com/games/ensign-1/forum/thread/onionman-will-there-be-any-further-updates-to-this-game\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/312310/discussions/0/613956964603040846/\n\n--\n\nMore than 1 year and not a single update.  Of course not because as we showed above the developer just threw this on Steam for a cash grab and Valve has allowed it to continue fully aware of this as I have already reported this title and they have taken 0 action.  That makes them 100% culpable for anyone duped by this author starting the day I posted this review (the same day I initially reported these and other facts to Valve).","April 16, 2015","false","0.5"," 55 of 57 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","55","57","0","4"

(You need to lead the "lasers".)\n\nThere's also a "creative mode" (aka editor?), but it is undocumented. (Press F1.)\n\nYou may be tempted to buy this game if you like space dogfights. I recommend that you check out the demo first; it is available on Desura[www.desura.com] until the developer is done "figuring out how this Steam thing works."\n\n\nUpdate: third mission completed, Rookie difficulty. Bugs. I can't man one of the turrets of the frigate, using a health dispenser I got stuck in the scenery, and the enemy is futilely firing at me even though it doesn't have line-of-sight. Still, it's sort of fun. The game seems to support Xbox controllers; would like to connect a flightstick, but have no idea if that would work.","December 1, 2014","false","3.1"," 46 of 56 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","46","56","0","12"

Not a single update since release and has been out for almost a year.\nCons:\n-Choppy gameplay\n-Almost impossible levels\n-Zero character development.\nPros:\n-Cool concept\n-Great Potential\n-Can get in and out of spaceships\n-Can man turrets\n-can fight with a laser pistol while not using turrets\n\nFinal review: 5.5/10\nDevs, please keep working on this game. It has so much potential, and can be made into something so much better.","October 3, 2015","false","2.2"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

If you want to you can install mods from  the FNaF launcher  to unlock bonus pony rainbow ♥♥♥♥♥. I think it's a really good game and a solid art. I traded a $300 Karambit knife for this and have never looked back.","March 22, 2015","true","0.3"," 2 of 49 people (4%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","4","2","49","8","0"
