I feel its time to review it.\n\nMy initial thoughts was this game is going to be OK, but i was actually quite impressed once i got in the swing of things.\n\nIt doesnt have spectacular graphics but it does have a modern retro feel to it if that makes sense, which is good! its straight forward and simple to understand, no silly controls just the basics which is all you need, you can actually play with 1 hand if ever you feel like doing that lol.\nThey do say its best played with a controller but myself prefer k/b mouse, it just feels more responsive to me, but you do have alot more control with a controller so its really what you feel comfortable with.\n\nThe gameplay itself, well its like a retro dogfighting space shooter thats super fast paced, it offers a nice selection of game modes such as survival where you fight waves of different types of enemies and last as long as you can, to challenge mode where you need to hit the checkpoints within the time limit, then theres the arcade mode which is more like your story mode where you have to follow a mission, which is actually my favourite mode, theres also an online mode which im yet to try out but im sure i will.\n(Be aware some modes not mentioned are still locked and are not currently playable right now)\n\nThe ships are not bad, a small variety to choose from and unlock through gaining points, they all have there own specs to suit your style but no customisation im afraid, that would be a cool feature to add tho.\nThe sound fx and soundtrack are pretty cool too and fits nicely with the games style, i did find the music abit glitchy at times or out of sync but not enough to annoy or put you off the game.\n\nSo overall I will say its not for the hardcore gamer but one of those games youl go back to every now and again, and if your an achievement hunter this will test your skills abit, and as im the type that gets frustrated quite easily i didnt find playing this that bad at all, infact i dont recall raging to this once so far, its actually quite relaxing to play.\n\nIm not gonna rate it but i will say its worth buying for those casual days! So go get it and enjoy! i did!\n\n*Video review will be linked here soon, for now go check out my gameplay videos:\nhttp://youtube.com/c/Carboncarl\n\n","November 5, 2015","true","7.5"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","0"

You can also unlock different ships for yourself to play.\n\nEvery ship plays differently and has different weapons.\n\nI played it with a Joystick / Flight Stick and it works fine, although I'd love to be able to "side-step" so-to-speak, but that isn't much of an issue by the time you get used to the controls.\n\nSound design seemed a bit basic.\n\nI'd say, if you like the look of this game, then definitely give it a spin!\n\n\nMy preview of Voxel Blast:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id4ff1joK6Y","October 22, 2015","true","0.7"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","15","19","0","0"
