No other compensation was given.\n\nIntroduction\n==========\nCrossCode is the perfect example of why Early Access exists. It gives us an idea of the game the developers have in mind, while allowing us to support them and help them to finish their game. CrossCode is an action RPG, and a shiny pearl in the sea of  trash that's currently swimming in Early Access. There are a lot of systems and features in place and ready to go, such as melee/ranged attacks, dodging, guarding, skill trees, elemental attacks, interacting with the terrain, trading, puzzle-filled dungeons, story scripting, enemy AI and attack patterns, bosses, and more! CrossCode draws heavily from the 16-bit era, and if you've played Secret of Mana or Zelda: A Link to the Past for the SNES, then you'll see the influence easily. The gameplay is very similar to those two games, and it's simply amazing. The current version of CrossCode is a set of demos, one for each mode: Story, Puzzle, and Exploration. I'll go over each one in turn.\n\nGameplay\n==========\nFirst, let's go over Story Mode. In Story Mode, you are introduced to a cast of characters and the game world. I'm not going to spoil anything here, but let's just say it's a premise that's been done before but with a few twists. You begin in a sort of tutorial area, which has you running a character through a small forested area towards a building. Along the way, you are taught the basic controls and basic combat abilities.  Once you reach the building a short dialogue occurs, then the game transitions to a cargo ship where we meet the main player character and the supporting cast. More tutorials occur, such as ranged and melee combat, switches, dodging, and later guarding. You have a melee slashing attack, and a ranged attack that has you shooting spheres. The spheres are able to bounce off walls when charged. The Story Mode demo wraps up after a boss battle that introduces an antagonist who tries to abduct the main character. She is saved by the supporting cast and makes an escape.\n\nNext, we have Puzzle Mode. Puzzle Mode takes you through a typical dungeon that will be implemented into the finished game. This has you hitting switches to open doors, moving boxes to press switches, navigating large rooms to solve puzzles scattered throughout, and ultimately ending up at a boss battle that introduces you to Boss AI scripting. It has 3 phases, the first being the melee phase. It'll be within your melee range, so just attack it normally. Next with Phase 2 it'll move away out of your melee range, so start using your ranged attacks. In the combat area are 2 switches which raise 2 pillars. When the boss starts charging up it super attack, hit one of the switches and hide behind a pillar that pops up. The boss will finish his attack, then hit the switch itself and lower the pillar and resume it's attacks. In phase 3 it gains a shield, which you need to solve a small puzzle to figure out how to bring it down. It involves bouncing your ranged attacks off of bumpers to hit it from behind, shorting out it's shield. Defeating it gives you the option to take on the "Final Challenge", which is a short Survival Mode, that has you fighting waves of enemies. The Puzzle Mode Demo wraps up afterwards.\n\nLast, we have Exploration Mode. This starts you in an area called Autumn's Rise, where you are introduced to even more features, like Elemental Attacks, Skills, Items, Equipment, and Combat Arts. In this mode you are free to explore the map, defeat enemies, and buy equipment and items from the few shops that are present. There are even a few trading booths where you can trade items you find for other items.  Exploration Mode ends when you find all of the hidden treasure chests in the area and open up the last challenge.\n\nGraphics\n==========\nCrossCode is a very colorful, vivid game, with detailed character sprites. Remember how the SNES did sprites? Take those, and make them 100 times better. CrossCode uses very crisp sprites with fluid animations for all aspects of gameplay. Attacks, movement, dodging, etc...all look extremely detailed and very well done. No complaints from me in the graphcis department. I grew up with classics like Super Mario World, Secret of Mana, Final Fantasy III (VI), Chrono Trigger, Earthbound, and Lufia, so I'm no stranger to sprite-based games. CrossCode features some of the best sprites I've ever seen in a video game. Even the character portraits are sprites!\n\nSound and Music\n==========\nGreat sound effects and cacthy tunes that fit any given situation. The music sounds like it would have been right at home on the SNES, and sounds very Secret of Mana or Star Ocean-esque; this fits the theme of the game extremely well. When combat starts the music changes to a more fitting tone, and transistions back to normal when combat is concluded. Being a big fan of video game music, I can't go on enough about how much I like the music in this game.\n\nPerformance\n==========\nI ran into absolutely no issues while playing CrossCode. Everything was crisp and smooth, no framerate issues or crashing. The game seems very well optimized for a game in what looks liek an alpha stage. This makes it very easy to recommend this game to all players who are fans of this genre, as they will have very little issues getting the game to run so they can enjoy it!\n\nFinal Thoughts\n==========\nThis game has everything you could possibly want from an action RPG. Combat, exploration, puzzles, dungeons...the concept is here and it's amazing. Please buy this to support the developers and help them get this gem finished! I'd hate to see such potential shut down, and this game has a ton of potential. It could be the next big indie title. It just needs a helping hand. And with Steam's Early Access program, that could very well happen. Even with it's early alpha/demo state, it still offers several hours of fun gameplay.\n\nGameplay Demo\n==========\nThis demo covers all of Puzzle Mode and a nice portion of Exploration Mode.\nhttps://youtu.be/6hQX5DcAvt8\n\nNerd House Verdict:\n==========\nHighly Recommended\n\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","June 26, 2015","true","11.0"," 56 of 65 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","56","65","2","13"

Something about this game has just made me want to support it and evangelize it in a way that no other game in the past really has. Maybe it's CrossCode's perfect fusion of classic SNES RPG visuals with slick, modern combat controls. Maybe it's a design so on point it feels like a case study in how to build a game right. Maybe it's that, running entirely in HTML5 and impact.js, it solidly demonstrates that the web browser is now a viable platform for precision-based gameplay. Or maybe it's that despite all of these things, no one seems to realize it exists, and it nearly didn't get funded because of it.\n\nCrossCode is definitely worth your attention, if not as an early access purchase then at least as something to check back on once it's released next year. While I still think Q2 2016 is a very aggressive schedule for a version 1 release and expect it to slip towards the end of the year, RadicalFishGames has shown an impressive amount of dedication, talent, and content thus far, and I fully believe they'll deliver on their ambitions. CrossCode is a poster child for why independent games matter more than ever in a market where AAA relevance is dwindling. It's destined to become a cult phenomenon, reverently mentioned in the same company as Cave Story, Braid, or Fez. I'm highly looking forward to it and you should be too.","August 7, 2015","true","121.9"," 33 of 33 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","33","33","0","1"

The gameplay feels responsive and is simple yet chalenging to play.  You have a dash or a block for defence, and a ranged "ball attack" or melee attack for offence.  This is the extent of gameplay at the begining of the game.  Their are upgrades which can give your character new skills and buffs.  Using all your characters abilities is essential to defeating enemies quickly and effectively.  Often I found I needed to learn the pattern of enemies and adapt how I played.\n\nYour main character's ranged attack "ball" attack can bounce a few times when charged up.  This is great since dungeons so far mainly consist of puzzles, which utilize this mechanic very well.  This mechanic so far has not gone stale, since thier are many objects your ball can trigger, reflect, pass though, remove, and hopefully their will be more things your ball can do.  I hope the devs continue with this because bosses could be such a treat to defeat.  Their will be some more mechanics added later which look like you can change "elements" of your attack mid battle.\n\nSo far CrossCode has some interesting RPG-like equipment system for armor, weapons, etc, which can be crafted from materials you find in the world and traded in for wearable equipment at vendors.\nOverall CrossCode could be a fantastic RPG with a fairly unique combat system.  In it's current state, CrossCode is very polished and up to my standards in terms of game-feel.  This game just feel great to play!  The fast pased action coupled with the meticulous puzzles offers a fantastic experience.  As long as Radicalfish continue development, like they have been.  I would recomend this game even in it's unfinished state.","November 30, 2015","true","11.3"," 30 of 31 people (97%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","97","30","31","2","4"

Give it a purchase if you're okay with waiting for the finished product.\n\n======================================\nPros+ Graphics: Oh my god yes. They're gorgeous!\n+ Animation: In a category all of it's own, literally.\n+ Music: As good as the graphics!\n+ UI: Stylish AND extremely functional.\n+ Story: Well written.\n+ Levels: Excellently designed with flawless puzzle integration.\n+ Combat: Fast paced, varied, excellent.\n\nCons- So much polish you MIGHT go blind.\n- It isn't finished yet! D:\n\nNeutral+/- The combat sequences may tend to drag on. Remains to be seen.\n\n======================================\nThis one impressed me from the very start. The music, colors, and animation I was greeted with on the title screen alone were all of fantastic quality. Upon entering the game, Crosscode treats you to a wonderful color palette, and a basic mysterious introductory story scene, that gives you a brief briefing of the combat system you'll be working with.\n\nCrosscode, from what I can tell, is a game about an AR MMO where the players are hooked into avatars made from instant matter. There is a physical location in the world starting with Rhombus Square where they can play the game. Their attacks, it seems, effect the physical world, although they can only be seen with AR glasses. It also seems that they are not necessarily prohibited from leaving their designated game zone.\n\nThe tutoral will cover all of this and a bit more, as you take on the role of the protagonist Lea, who has amnesia and is going to be playing the game to attempt to recover her memories. The story may be starting to become familiar territory, but aside from a few grammatical mistakes, is excellently written. Likewise, the gameplay is as smooth as can be, with many options for you.\n\nIn combat, you can fight with ranged or melee, even to some extent simaltaneously, and both will be needed, but often times you are allowed to use either as you see fit. There will be many RPG features like equipment, a sprawling skill tree reminiscent of Path of Exile, inventory management, levels and experience, etc. The gameplay I've experienced so far reminds me a lot of Golden Sun, in that it's an action-puzzler RPG with excellent graphics, world design, and puzzle elements flawlessly integrated into said world design.\n\nThe UI is also flawless, and the developers have made it very easy to navigate. It's stylish but also very functional. The game has full keyboard/mouse and controller support, but goes the extra mile to make keyboard navigation easy. The camera transitions, dialogue, and everything else are smooth and refreshingly simple.\n\nAfter playing this demo I could not be more excited about the final product-which I will now commence eagerly awaiting. Even more importantly, this demo has made me feel like I have a high degree of assurance this will be a game of the utmost quality.\n\n======================================\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","June 22, 2015","true","5.0"," 37 of 44 people (84%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","84","37","44","3","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FIGHTME/recommended/368340/","FIGHTME","I love the lag","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FIGHTME/","482 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nCrosscode is a game that I decided not to back initially, because I thought the project had unrealistic goals.  Upon revisiting it in the demo and pre-purchasing, I think I can safely say that I was not only wrong, but that is the only project I even remotely regret not backing.  This is what I think an indie game should aspire to be: a passion project that has standout and unexpected production quality.\n\nDescribing Cross Code is difficult, because almost no one has played any of the games it most resembles.  Alundra, Terranigma, Secret of Mana, Shining Soul, Robotron, Gunman Clive... probably the closest well-known parallel is Zelda, and this ain't no Zelda.  In short, it's a top-down fast-paced action game with SNES era style graphics, "phantasy star" sort of character design, large puzzle sections and some quality of life improvements from modern games.  I'd say the closest new game in function is Hyper Light Drifter (which is quite similar), although the two games greatly differ in tone with Crosscode being much much lighter and transparent about its premise, but much less stylish and ambitious in that regard.\n\nI don't want to just gush about this, so here's what's bad:  Flavor-wise the story and setting are busy and inane: People are playing an MMO as hard-light beings on a real-life alien planet, and you're injected into things as an outsider with likely special capabilities as well as amnesia and limited speech capabilities.  Some people are obstensibly people in the cities, so it's impossible to figure out what are questgiving ai characters and inhabitants of the cities which is fairly irresponsible given the MMO players are basically operating killing machines.  It's dumb, but it lets the game be a game and do whatever it really wants to.  In line with this, some of the characters are kind of annoying as well, in particular anyone who can't help but mix in words from other languages in nearly every single line of dialogue.\n\nIn addition, puzzle-and-action hybrids often have a lot of issues regarding their audience.  Although I for one love the mix, you force action lovers to do puzzles in order to play more of what they like and vice versa, and the game is linear.  In particular, the dungeons are very very puzzle heavy almost to the point of exhaustion, and the rest of the game is somewhat light on them (although the mix is worked in much better as of the latest overworld area).\n\nSomewhere between bad and good is the music.  Most of the tracks are forgettable and a few are very unappealing short-loop midi-quality stuff.  On the other hand, the newest town theme and especially the boss theme are fantastic.  When you fight a tough opponent you will find no fault in the music for getting you psyched, and that's really what I'm looking for in this type of game.\n\nSpeaking of bosses, let's get into the good stuff.  The bosses themselves are pure pixel porn and must have been ages to animate given their size, and they are a joy to fight with their gimmicks and weaknesses- and ability to sometimes cover up their weakness or turn your exploitation of it back at you.  In particular, the duel against a foe of similar abilities is a blast because his AI is shockingly adept for this kind of game.  In addition, certain special encounters against regular enemies are made much more interesting with strange arenas or mixes of opponents.  Healing is tricky due to a delay but very helpful in some particularly deadly fights.  It's obvious that in most cases, these guys know encounter design inside and out.\n\nPart of what makes bosses so fun to fight are the controls.  I cringed when I saw that the bumpers were going to be the main attack and dodge buttons, and that the right stick was used to aim shots, but actually it works very well on a 360 controller.  The bumpers depress pretty quick, allowing you to really tear into stuff- but it is tiring over a long play session.  Everything is fluid, from dodging to attacks to blocking to using special moves.  I didn't suffer any slowdown at all compared to Hyper Light Drifter, not that my computer is top of the line.  Pretty exceptional, really.\n\nOn the subject of slowdown, in the overworld areas it's pretty amazing just how much stuff is going on.  Despite the goofy setting, the illusions they use to convey a living world (mainly resting avatars and huge number of "travelling" players) are really good without interfering at all.  The towns feel populated, which is rare, and the trading mechanic supplements the cash shops really nicely in my opinion.  You can also jump all over the place, even if it's always going to be tricky figuring out elevation in a 2D game.  Still, you can jump on just about everything in a very golden-sun style of conspicuous parkour in order to find out-of-reach treasures, and for me that was just a joy.\n\nAlmost exclusively the puzzles are excellent.  They are unfortunately linear, but make up for it by teaching you constantly.  Each dungeon so far has two gimmicks that each engage differently with most or all of your abilities you'll have up to that point, and serve a purpose in fights.   Many puzzle rooms also contain additional goodies for going the extra mile as well.  A few of them, however, require fairly precise timing or aim (or both) and I can see some players getting stuck.\n\nIn short, I think this is a standout title and am greatly looking forward to its release- and would encourage anyone not disinterested due to the style or other negatives to do the same.","May 17","true","16.6"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","19","20","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SquireZed/recommended/368340/","SquireZed","Squire Zed","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SquireZed/","3371 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis isn't going to be a particularly long review, but I'm going to try to highlight the best things about this game that I've seen so far.\n\nGameplay: Gameplay is challenging, action oriented, and has a good deal of depth, with close combat and ranged attacks joined by powerful abilities, fluid and fun movement, dodging, and blocking to provide a robust game experience. A+\n\nArt: Charming retro art that doesn't have the "Love me because of nostalgia" vibe. The developers are amazing at this kind of art, and the love and detail put into this game is clear. A\n\nSound: The music does get a bit repetitive at times, but is cheerful enough and in keeping with the graphics. The sound effects could use a bit of variety, but they serve well enough and are quite functional. While you'll be listening to a ton of the same stuff, it's solid, and my only complaint is the scarcity because I would love more (and I'd buy the soundtrack).  B\n\nStory: Still in progress. The developers are putting content ahead of story in their priorities, so there's still quite a bit to play even though the story (more of a prologue at this point) only runs about an hour. The dialogue is tounge-in-cheek and often parodies videogame cliches, but does so without being too heavyhanded and I find it quite amusing. If the story is writen as well as the dialogue is, I forsee the outcome being quite good. ?????\n\nSystems: I normally don't take note of a game's systems like UI because normally I just suffer through mediocre menus, only noticing when something is so painfully tedious that it requires extra effort. However, the UI of Crosscode is exquisite, with clear markers of what's happening when, items sorted neatly, and quick, easy to navigate menus. If every RPG had this menu system, I would not complain. It is wonderful. A++++\n\nI have no complaints with this game in its current state. It is in early access (0.4 at the moment) and I expect there to be plenty of room to grow- and that's apparent. This will be one of those games that I check out every time a major update gets pushed out. I have no concerns for the future of the game because a wonderful foundation is in place, and as long as the developers manage to keep improving (the last time I played before Early Access was an early beta demo that only had the first few stages in, and I was hooked then) it will be great! The only danger I see is the chance of grind in the future; it's already a little bit grindy (since it's styled like an MMO, with MMO style quests and drop rates and leveling and all that entails) but if the gameplay is as solid as it is I will at least enjoy it.\n\nOverall: Undecided. I am very optimistic, and would enthusiastically recommend it to anyone who enjoys action combat, RPGs, and puzzle platforming. There is a lot of potential here, and as long as it doesn't get botched I see it being a wonderful game. Likewise, my few complaints may be addressed in the future, so I don't want to leave any negative feedback that doesn't accurately reflect a later state of the game (since I'll probably forget to update this).

If however all you want is a full game then\nput this game into your WISHLIST RIGHT NOW. Right before release (Q3 2016) the game will be around 10% off again and you will be getting a mail, so you can have another look at it before it releases.\nUntil then you can play the introductionary Demo on the game's website[cross-code.com].\n\nWhat we have at hand already and the way the devs communicate their thoughts and development process in their blog and in live streams makes me very positive, that the end product will be of highest quality and lots and lots of fun.\n\n\nAbout Early AccessAs I'm writing this review, the game has just been crowdfunded and full time development has started just now, so atm there's not really enough content to justify the 20€ (or 20 whatevers) price tag.\nThat said, the devs have always been very open about their progress on the game (as you can see here on the devs' blog[www.radicalfishgames.com]), so it is only natural for them to let everyone have Alpha and Beta access if they choose so. Steam is also the easiest way to provide early access to those, who have paid considerable amounts in the crowdfunding campaign.\nWe can expect a lot of progress in the next few months as most of the custom engine is already done and it's all about content creation from now on, save for some balancing, bugfixing and general tweaking at the end, I suppose.\n\nIf you want to see this game go from 10% done to 100% done in the next year and a bit, then I can recommend buying it right now. In any case though, I beg you to put it in your wishlist and have a look at it next year again.\n\n\nVisuals and SoundOh god... the sprite art is simply amazing. The animations are really, really good, the maps are very colourful, detailed and lively. The combination of pre-industrial aesthetics and a lot of nature with sci-fi themes is intriguing and seeing their latest screenshots, I'd say it's going to be a treat.\nThe soundtrack so far is just as strong. Here's the soundcloud playlist[soundcloud.com]. Go and dig it. My favourite title isn't even in the playlist. It's no chiptune, but it definitely takes inspiration from some SNES titles.\nThe sound effects do a great job of supporting the gameplay. You get actual audio feedback from your actions, making each attack and each jump feel so much more enjoyable and satisfying.\n\n\nGameplay and ControlsFinally, the actual reason why I love this game already. You know that the gameplay is good when even the most basic actions feel awesome and are fun. In this case that includes running, gunning and fighting.\n\nThe character moves at a proper pace and the auto-jump mechanic is weirdly fun. You would think auto-jumping would be "meh", but jumping around feels pretty good actually and as a plus: not only are the controls streamlined, you also always jump off as close to the edge as possible. One has to experience it to believe it i think (go play the demo). All in all I have a lot of fun with platforming here.\n\nYour fighting options include melee and shooting/throwing projectiles as offensive actions as well as blocking and dashing. On top of that you will be getting some special abilities while leveling up. All of these are sensible actions, opening the game to different play styles. Generally the fighting is fast paced and action oriented and while atm the most effective way to deal with most mobs is melee, I'm fairly positive that in the future we will see more opponents that require the use several skills in order to take them down (like the meerkats that are already there).\n\nOther than places to run and fight there will also be dungeons filled with puzzles, which is where the projectiles come in handy. But yeah, not much to say about that, yet.\n\nThe controls are more on the side of streamlined yet powerful giving you the option of using "WASD+Space+Mouse" or "Dual-Stick+A+B" (that doesn't include extra buttons for menuing only).

So far so good!\n\nMaking these kinds of promises as a new development team certainly takes a lot of... courage, but how does CrossCode hold up so far? Thankfully, the current Early Access version is split into three parts, each of which is focused on one of these things:\n\n- Exploration Mode puts you into a large open area populated by monsters. It allows you to get a feel for the game's controls as well as the extensive systems for skills (think FFX's sphere grid, but designed by a sober person) and equipment. Trying to find a large number of hidden chests you get the chance to freely jump and battle your way through the area, all the while learning new techniques and improving the stats of your character. This mode makes up the bulk of the game's current playing time and is I have had a blast playing it. Running and jumping around is just a ton of fun! While it took me a while to get comfortable with the controls during fighting, the feeling you have when you start improve and manage to defeat large mobs of enemies (that just minutes earlier were vanquishing you mercilessly) is incredibly rewarding. The game it reminded me most of is Bastion, which was one of my favorite Indie action games of the last few years, but with the beautifully animated SNES-era graphics it of course also recalls classics such as Terranigma.\n\n- Puzzle Mode shows you an example of what the dungeons of the finished game might look like. It is only a short part of the current version, but it complements the action-y parts very well and gazing into my crystal.. eh... sphere I foresee a lot of fun once these puzzles get properly integrated into the main narrative. Think Alundra, but with a feeling that you have actually solved the puzzle instead of exploiting the game's jump physics (nah, I'm just breaking your.. stones here, Alundra, you're a great game)\n\n- Story mode mostly works as a tutorial for the controls and an introduction to some of the game's main characters as well as a teaser as the game's larger world and plot. So if you're hoping to get deep into the world of CrossCode already, this might leave you with a severe case of blue testes, but that's not a bad thing in my book. Well I guess it is... should have rephrased that. Anyway, I'd rather have the chance to enjoy the game's style and mechanics now instead of delving into the plot too deeply - that's best left for when the game is actually finished.\n\nSO GET TO THE POINT, SHOULD I BUY CROSSCODE NOW?\nWell, maybe! ("Ooh, such decisiveness," the crowd murmured approvingly.)\nSee, part of me wants to go and make everybody buy this now, but I think that would do the game a disservice. CrossCode is certainly not a finished game at this point, even if the controls, animation and soundtrack already have a very high level of polish. And the current price is certainly at the level (or likely even above) where the finished product will be sold next year. So I would suggest this: if this sounds like your kind of game and you're curious to experience a game as it goes from its early stages to a fully fleshed out product - get it now! If you're interested but already don't have the time to play half the fully-finished games in your backlog? Then put it on your wishlist, follow their regularly updated and very detailed development blog and come back in a year or so. This is not a game that will always be expanded or be significantly cheaper during Early Access.\n\nIn short, CrossCode is already a ton of fun, and if the devs keep their eyes on the .. prize then this should turn out to be a great game once it's done.\n\n\nFull disclosure: I backed this game during the Indiegogo campaign and I'm friends with some of the devs, so I might not be entirely trustworthy. But for what it's worth, I promise you that I wouldn't have written any of this if I didn't enjoy the game and thought it deserved a wider exposure. AND I DIDN'T EVEN SAY BALLS ONCE. EXCEPT FOR NOW.

Oooooh, this game. Even in it's uncompleted state is near a masterpiece.  I'll try not to fanboy about how "Unrivaled in awesomeness, DUUUUUUDE" it is. So, beginning the review, as well as spoilers. Crosscode is an amalgam of Kingdom Hearts style gameplay and atmosphere, an MMORPG, Zelda style puzzles, and a Megaman Battle Network (Which is a massively under-appreciated series.) aesthetic. As gameplay starts, it introduces you to a vague character in a vague setting on a vague quest. The first part ends with a death-scene of a character you don't know at all, and switches scenes to a fututristic setting with a girl floating in stasis , whom you can only assume is yourself. And if you had any doubts about this game (Which I'm sure you would, considering the very vague beginning), they're near immediately flushed away by a short but effective tutorial leading to your first boss fight. You're then told about the setting of the game, being a futuristic MMO that directly plugs your five senses into the game, and that you're a player who logged in, and for a yet unexplained reason, forgot everything. Picture the Matrix, but optional, and with less brain jacks. The game also very cleverly integrates the silent hero trope, with the fact that your voice synthesis is malfunctioning. A common problem, it seems.After dramatically escaping the cargo ship that nobody knows why you were on, (and a Naruto poser) you arrive at the entrance to the first dungeon, Rhombus Dungeon(Or whatever it's called). Going through the dungeon there are several puzzles for you to solve with your throwing-balls. You then shortly arrive at a beautiful town, all yours to explore! This is where the story stops. As you may have noticed, this is early access, and is in beta. The next part of the story is almost here, but for now, we can grind levels, do quests, and listen to the guy telling us to "become water" by jumping into the fountain. I urge you to buy this game, as the developers benefit from it, and can crank out more game more efficiently, and continue to make us all happy with this rising star of an indie game.","November 3, 2015","true","14.0"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","0"

Back then, it wasn't even an RPG; it was basically a simulation of the aiming engine, a clone of the early tutorial now present in the current version of the game. As little of a resemblance that web-version has with the current state of the game, it did show the talent and ambition of the developers, and what has been added since is astonishing.\n\nAstonishingly good. Although there are some loose ends in the story still, this is due to the fact the game is actually in Early Access as of writing this review. And already now, it's worth the $20.\n\nWhy? Well, first of all, the game looks extremely polished already. The pixelated sprites 'fit' each other, controls have been neatly arranged and the game mechanics up until now have been executed to near perfection.\n\nThese mechanics are quite plentifully present, actually. Every enemy has specific attacks and weaknesses, and even different 'evolutions' of itself. The attacking system is as elegant as it is challenging; WASD to move, left-click to hit, right-click to dodge/block. That's it. The maps have been built in such a way it is relatively easy to traverse through for a quick sweepthrough, but provides quite the challenge when going for the semi-hidden presents scattered all over the maps.\n\nNow, of course, as it is still in development, the main plot of the story is finished in roughly half an hour. After that, you're kind of being released into the world, in order for you to explore on your own. Quests can be completed, ranging from collecting items to beating enemies. Because of the layout of the maps, some of those can take some time; not in an annoying way though, as you're mostly being busy trying to work out how to get to a certain ledge.\n\nThe only negative in this version is that the 'open-world' feeling of the game is somewhat limited. This is caused by the facts that certain buildings aren't visitable, some paths are blocked, and the world is consisting of only 5 maps (a city, 2 trails, the tutorial map and the main hub - these are rather extensive, though!). I'm not only expecting, but quite frankly plain confident the devs will be able to make that point go away.\n\nThe game is already a blast to play through, and with the constant stream of content updates, it'll only get better.\n\nIn short: Buy it now. This might be one of those underestimated games, deserving a lot more exposure.","November 9, 2015","true","19.7"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","1"

Overall great fun, especially for a demo (usually, hopefully, a dev's "best foot forward").\n\nPros:\n\n- Clearly a lot of thought was put into designing the main cast; not just in looks but in characterization as well.  Each one's clearly unique and has his or her own attitude and way of speaking (or not ;).  The nameless masses are less visually impressive, but still usually have interesting things to say.\n- Likewise, the backstory is detailed and pretty well thought-out, and the dialog is pretty consistent so far, not to mention incredibly witty.\n- Awesome awesome awesome "16-bit" graphics.  There's a lot more sophisticated effects than Mode 7 at work here, but it still has the look:  an elegant style from a more civilized age.\n- Gameplay is very fluid, especially important when combat is king and timing is everything.\n- Challenging puzzles that make good use of the abilities you're given.\n\nCons:\n\n- K&M controls were a little awkward, mostly trying to track a target with the mouse while also dodging enemy attacks.    (Hope it's better with a gamepad, because this would make an awesome handheld game (e.g. on the Shield or even PSVita).\n- Three different types of in-game dialog.  I understand they're for different purposes (cutscenes, in-game conversation, and "overheard" conversations) and so basically necessary, but could they at least use the same key(s) to continue?  In particular, G is used to continue in the latter two, and MouseLeft is (of course) your attack button; but for cutscenes G is the Skip button, while MouseLeft continues the conversation.\n- It's SHORT!  I'm definitely looking forward to seeing the rest.  Now, I bought it in a bundle, so I've probably already got my money's worth, but I'd probably drop $20 on a copy to give away once I've got an idea of what's in store.\n- Tutorial did not run with the obvious joke about "a girl who can handle balls". ;D\n\nWishlist:\n\n- Multiplayer.  I mean, it IS an MMOG... simulator.  But it would be nifty at least to be able to "join" other players' games in progress, à la Borderlands.\n- Voice acting.  Stretch goal, I know, but it could be great.","December 13, 2015","true","1.9"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

Though lacking in content (what'd you expect?) it is polished, well presented, and overall fun.\n\nThe core genre of the game is an action-rpg, but the game is tuned immensely well. You are enticed to actually learn the (fairly simple) mechanics of dodging and guarding, and attacking and using skills wisely. As such, you cannot call this game a hack-n-slash. It is action-rpg to the fullest, and you encouraged to level up, explore the world, and master the skills given to you in the game.\n\nOverall, I'd say it takes about 3-4 hours to complete the demo if you're just learning the mechanics, but is very much a fun trip. I look forward to future content, as the groundwork has been clearly established.","May 20, 2015","true","6.6"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

The combat is ultra-smooth and frenetic which is aces, but the true standout here is the levels and encounters. In the first dungeon alone there is so much good synergy between Lea's moveset (melee, dashing, hopping on things, throwing balls) and the dungeon elements. It's the sort of design that makes the player feel impossibly clever when they figure the puzzles out. If the next three (implied, but hopefully more) dungeons have the same level of polish and thought, I will be very pleased. Plus, Lea doesn't take forever to push boxes in box puzzles around, so CrossCode has that going for it.\nSomehow, through clever dialogue and character portraits, I now care deeply about a character that can only say two words.\nSure, it's Early Access, so it's not completely done.

It looked really interesting to me and I decided to do more research and play the demo myself. I am so glad that I did. I've never seen a demo with such polish and I sank a good 6 or 7 hours into it before the early access on steam became available. CrossCode hits all the right buttons for me as a gamer. The graphics and gameplay take me back to the glory days of SNES action RPGs like The Secret of Mana. I get a Squaresoft like vibe from the game and that's a good thing. I immediately helped fund this game (a first for me). It's a very charming game thus far and I look forward to the full release.

First off the 16-bit artwork and sprites are fantastic and well animated. The few special moves you have access to in this early access version look awesome and are very satisfying to use. The blend of ranged and close-fighting may need some balancing because as fun as pelting everything with balls is I find myself obliterating stuff with melee much quicker. On the note of combat the enemies are pretty J/ARPG stock with predictable patterns that you can learn quickly and manouever around. That being siad, if you find yourself out of sync with a few different enemy types around, you get punished pretty bad.\n\nAs for exploration and puzzle solving, there's plenty of that. Jump puzzles EVERYWHERE and they are fairly clever most of the time and have little "Ooo! Piece of candy!" rewards at the ends. So far as puzzles go it's been pretty standard yet entertaining so far. You bounce your spheres around obstacles and hit targets occasionally while fighting off critters that distract you from a ticking clock.\n\nFinally, the story. It's decently interesting so far. Sort of a digital world melding with the physical world thing and causing a ruckus. So all-in-all I say shell out $20 and enjoy a little nostalgia and support these guys.

Imagine a Danmaku inside a LoZ game inside a skill-tree RPG. That is what this game is, and holy crap it is amazing. I bought it early access because of that demo (and also the fact that I prolly won't have funds when this actually comes out).\n\nThe early access currently features a bit more than the original demo (not the newer, more restriced one). The world exploration is phenominal. My only qualm at this point is that judging height when platforming is a bit tricky, but that can be fixed with some depth cues based on lighting.\n\nThe art is amazing. The music is amazing. The polish is amazing, but the real point where this stands out is its gameplay. As I said, it feels like an LoZ game with danmaku elements. The skills are pretty cool too.\n(btw this is what I got from the original demo.

So, how well does the game runs in terms of its presentation, gameplay, story?\n\nPros:\n+Vivid and beautiful graphics with smooth 60 FPS animation\n+Soothing and exhilarating soundtrack and perfectly syncronised audio\n+Simple and easy-to-learn combat mechanics with many combos that can be freely executed\n+Variety of puzzles you can solve that is not too challenging but not too easy as well\n+Very well designed world environment that allows to traverse around easily\n+Nicely written and interesting plot with a mix of futuristic sci-fi and dungeon crawler fantasy\n\nOkay that's quite a lot of good sides there but what about the bad sides? Well, to be honest, I don't find any problem during gameplay and I actually enjoy it despite being early access but there are very few that I want to point out.\n\nCons:\n-Some battles can be frustrating at first and the first challenge starts very early\n-You need a lot of info on the environment around you and it takes time in order to get from one point to a desired point\n-Might experience lag in some points\n-Game contents are still small right now\n\nThe game is written in HTML 5 instead of C++ or Python but it runs as .exe so I can't tell whether the game runs natively or still relies a lot on a default web browser.\n\nSo, is the game finally worth it to buy and play at this point? This game has many potentials here at its beta stage, but unless you're willing to support the developers, I'd say you have to wait until the game is finish developed, polished and ready to be publish as a full game.","March 15","true","28.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Despite that it is in early release, it is really well polished.\n\nThe short part of the story story included is good, graphics and animations are 16-bit eye-candy, and the music fits well.\n\nThe best part in my opinion is the combat system.

There are other aspects like attack elements you can easily switch between while attacking, and other special abilities and upgrades you can unlock.  There is also a simple,efficient, "no-nonsense" equipment system, which isn't tedious or time consuming like in many games.\n\nThe game is polished well enough to be a final product (minus content wise, being still in early release), and that nothing feels tedious; I've played hours and haven't gotten tired of combat (which is saying a lot for me, I end up avoiding combat half the time in many a game because it can get annoying).  Plus, you can just walk/run away when you don't want to fight (except boss battles.)\n\nThis is only the second review I've ever felt motivated enought to write, so take my word for it; this game is really good.","July 5, 2015","true","40.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","6","7","2","0"

It's got the basis of what might be one of the greatest indie hits of all time, but for the moment it's just a cool engine with a few towns in. The quests seem random and overwhelming and experimental, the story ends 15 minutes into the game for the moment (they're working on it), and there's no telling how long the game will be when its done.\n\nThe combat is super cool however. It feels so damn rewarding and the talent-system is so engaging its incredible. I only wish there will be more sick and awesome spells, and that in the end there will be a story worth following, epic loot worth striving for (atm its just empty stats that seem to do very little to how you play. Gear doesn't feel rewarding to equip at all, and the menu is a hassle to get through cause they all look the same) and something to tie the world together so it doesn't just feel like different levels of a platformer and more like a coherent world.","January 6","true","4.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

Stand true to the demo and kept its own promises and features. It's somewhat sad that the story arc is still somewhat short, but as the game is now, which I presume is still not that far completed, It already rack at least some 10+hours of gameplay doing the various quests and solving puzzles. The most different feature about this game is the fluid combat. Which remember the portable versions of The Legend Of Zelda, such as Minish Cap, but overall way better and with more skill-oriented combat features. Sure, level and equipments make a lot of difference, so it's not "pure strategy and skill" but still, timing and precision play a major role in being sucessfull or not. Grinding the mobs is also quite fun with the rank system.\n\nI'm eagerly awaiting for the full release!","May 17","true","32.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

What at first glance may look like standard RPG Maker fare is actually something quite different, and very refreshing. CrossCode is probably best described as a mix of SEGA's classic Phantasy Star series of RPGs - including its groundbreaking MMO spinoff Phantasy Star Online (which very obviously informed CrossCode's scenario and design) - as well as HAL Laboratories' somewhat obscure Super Famicom hack 'n' slash title Alcahest, to which CrossCode bears likeness in its fast-paced combat and movement system. The look and feel is quite authentically that of an early 32-bit era game, still resorting to tile-based 2D graphics, but taking advantage of the "new hardware" for large sprites, zoom and lighting effects, and other shenanigans. All of that, combined with a so far very solid narrative and set of characters, makes for a game that is most definitely worth keeping an eye on. The price tag may be a bit steep for some, but it can be found on sale and in bundles quite regularly, and there's also a free demo available, so there's little reason to not at least give it a try.","May 8","true","1.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/soulia/recommended/368340/","soulia","Full Retard Onii-chan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/soulia/","124 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nUpdated 4/10/2016 to reflect the current state of the game.\n\nSteam is saturated with early access sham games these days. They all release in some kind of beta sandbox state, with the dev house behind it promising the moon and the sun to the community within a year or so. Often enough these products stagnate and never realize any "potential" the hype train saw in the game. CrossCode is not another one of these games.\n\nCrossCode is a wonderful action RPG that takes place in an alien world where gamers far away connect to avatar bodies and occassionally throw balls at hedgehogs, cows and similar kinds of dogs. Lea, the protagonist (so we're led to believe so far) is suffering a mad bout of amnesia. A floaty head guy tells Lea to play the game to kickstart her memory and following drama involving a giant enemy crab you begin your quest among the peasants to hopefully remember something about your past.\n\nThe developers have done a wonderful job pacing the release of the story along side the development of important gameplay features which has made every new release feel well rounded out and avoids spoiling the end before the game itself is complete. At the same time, they have been very responsive to input from the community which has thwarted any notions of stagnation (*cough* Starbound *cough*). The story is not yet complete so it would be ill-advised to buy the game expecting a full story right now.\n\nIntertwined with the story are many side quests. Many of these are not required, but they help cement the impression of being in a living MMOG world and are justly incentivized to help you cut down the amount of grind time you have to spend to advance the actual plot. The standard quests are typically matters of item collection or monster slaying, and other kinds of quests are available if you seek them out. Those so far seem to entail more challenging monster battles or terrain puzzles.\n\nThe physics engine underneath everything is so smooth that you'll never feel like you're fighting your character or the environment. This lends itself well to the gratuitous ball throwing and parkour fun throughout the game and largely due to this you'll spend less time being frustrated by clunky gameplay and more time getting swole to beat a certain spikey haired rival into the ground.\n\nCharacters in this game have so far been very likeable with colorful (not in the derogatory sense) dialogue and unique personality. Additionally the game has an MMOG-like character party system which works and feels similar to any other MMOG analogue. This might seem minor, but considering the world of CrossCode is actually a pseudo-MMOG it adds realism to the experience and being able to bring other players into your party really makes any grinding stints much more fun.\n\nMap design has so far been stellar. One thing that has been nice about the travel areas is they fairly open and built into the terrain are often parkour puzzles that hide not only collectables but also now players with quests to give you as well. There are still several that aren't done, but I expect it will be about the same level of quality.\n\nThere are only a few things I'd like to see improve, but does not deter my recommendation:\n\n- It would be really nice to see gamepad controls improve. With a keyboard and mouse, if you need to aim for throwing a projectile you move the mouse cursor outwards in the direction of the target which allows smooth correction as you move or the target moves. With a gamepad (specifically, the Xbox One controller) you must use the right control stick to specify the direction of aim. This effectively moves your point of reference to over your characters head which makes it very difficult to aim with any precision. I feel like it would be reasonable if they added an aim assist for gamepad play to even out the gameplay experience between gamepad and keyboard control schemes.\n\n- I still feel like the skill tree could use some expansion. But it is a minor point and the system as is works well enough given the amount of available play time available from the game.\n\nOverall this game is a worthy purchase for early access. If you're looking to support development or just really like throwing balls its worth a buy. If you want a full story to play through right at this moment, however, I'd advise waiting to play the game until it is completed.","July 24, 2015","true","21.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

When I played the demo for this game it really got me excited and eager to buy it. When I bought the game, I played through and have just gotten to the part where the story ends. I understand that this is a early acess game, and things wil get better, but at the same time there is barely 2 hours of story where the game currently is. I really enjoy the fast paced an tight combat, as it is very fun and unique. Most of the combat elements seem pretty well sorted out as far as I can tell, but ogreall the story just needs more to keep me into it. Once again, this game is in earl acess and I get that. There will be limits to what is done right now. All I can say is that I really enjoy the game and like where it is going. I reccomend this game to anyone with a few bucks and looking for fun combat, and an interesting story. I do not recommend this game to anyone that is currently looking for a cheap and fun game with a nice story line. With the state this game is in at this point in time, it's just not worth $20.00.

Don't let that deter you. The journey there is inventive, the systems here are wonderfully implemented, and the world is gorgeous.

It also makes me unreasonably happy that the devs follow the "show, don't tell" way of introducing new mechanics. For example, in the newest dungeon, the Bergen Temple Mines, the entire area revolves around ice physics. In one room, you can't go anywhere because a pillar blocking one way, and there's a force field blocking the other. If you try shooting the pillar, you learn it can move around on the ice, until it hits a wall. Later, you find another room sealed off with a bomb near a rock with a pillar behind it. Here, you learn bombs can move pillars, and is key in progressing in the room. The only time the game outright tells you how to progress is at the very beginning when the girl giving the tutorial straight up says something like, "Okay, you can charge your shot, and when charged it ricochets." Beyond that, it feels like the devs put a lot of heart in to the game, the puzzles are interesting, the towns are fairly large and feel busy, and they put in a couple of fun references to other things, like the Giga Spiral Drill (said to be able to pierce through the heaven itself) and some other references I'm sure went over my head.\n\nIt's very nice visually, screenshots do it no justice, you really have to see the game in motion to have an appreciation for it. The music is very Kingdom Hearts-like, which is a plus in my book, and your shots make a very satisfying "thwack" when it hits something.\n\nOne thing I DON'T like about the game is some of the platforming. On one hand, it's nice that you don't have to keep mashing the jump button to get up on ledges, but on the other hand, one example I can think of is in the Bergen Temple MInes, where I fell off quite a number of times trying to do a simple jump because I couldn't control when I jumped, and jumping at angles generally feels weird to me. And even then, it was only the one time that really stuck out to me, and by and large it works fine, it's just a personal gripe.\n\nAnother thing I don't like is that the game is incomplete. Which is why I bought another copy to give to a friend who I showed it to, so he could also get hyped for future updates and so I could throw more money at Radical Fish Games.\n\nFinal verdict: "I'm throwing my money at the screen and nothing is happening!"/10 I highly recommend it, even in it's incomplete state, if only to support Radical Fish and get the word out of what I hope will be the next big name in Indie gaming.","January 1","true","10.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This game is shaping up to be a masterpiece. It has been years since I've played old RPGs such as Final Fantasy or Chrono Trigger etc. One reason for this was because I had gotten tired of the usual RPG formula: complex story, boring combat (I like faster paced combat), and a tendency towards grinding. One game in particular that I played a bit more was the Gameboy Advance version of DBZ The legacy of Goku 1 & 2, because it didn't have the rigid combat format of other RPGs. It was an Action RPG which made it quite refreshing to play.\n\nCrossCode has done a simply amazing job at bringing action, rpg elements and a damn good story to the genre. I can't wait to see where this goes and I have very high hopes.\n\nAt its current state I'd say it's worth a buy just to experience the combat.

It is basically what the Megaman RPG  for PS2 should've been instead of A traditional turn-based system.\n\nGamers familiar with Illusion of Gaia, Megaman, Contra, Zelda and Chrono Trigger will feel right at home with this gem. Their influences runs deep in this game, but what is so profound is how completely original this game is. It is inspired by classic elements of old but it doesn't by any means try to make you feel like you're playing an old school game.

I have never done it before and am not somebody who gives money away without thinking much about it.\nThe answere is simple: the demo. I played the demo of this game and it had more content than other games ever will have. It was funny, the mechanics where great, the music and graphics are absolutly beautiful and you can feel that they where made with a lot of love.\n\nThis game may look like a RPG-Maker title but that's just because of the graphics, I mean if you put Golden Sun on Steam people would think it is made in the RPG-Maker. This game is written in a JavaScript Engine, it runs smoothly, has an interesting real time fighting system and in this stage of the game you can already see it's potential. I can just say: support this awesome game even when it is an early access title,\n\nOh and I defenitly spent more time with the game than just the 2 hours of the steam version because the demo obviously isn't countet to it.

Even killing the same enemies again and again is fun due to fast and not too simple combat system.\n\nThe gameplay in short is comprised of the following:\nYou hit enemies with melee attacks and shoot at them at the same time and you dash to dodge and block for defense. You also use varous special skills from time to time of 4 types: shooting skill, melee skill, dash skill and defense skill. There are several variants to choose from of each of the four. Plus from time to time you can apply elemental damage to your attack.\n\nThe development of the character is comprised of getting new levels given for killings. With levels the stats grow and you choose passive bonuses and aforementioned special skills. There are also equips.\n\nThere's also the beginning of some plot which isn't ready yet.

Yeah- totally worth the buy even in it's current state. This "JRPG"'s progress is glorious.\nUnlike most Early Access games on Steam, this project is full of amazing gameplay mechanics and beautiful pixel art- all of which can be followed on their regular Twitch Dev livestream. This genuinely is one of the best "retro" games on Steam. If you enjoyed old 2D games action/RPGs like Secret of Mana and the like, then you'd get a kick out of CrossCode.\n\nWith a little more detail?Graphics\nBrilliantly done pixel art animations that display the world and battles with great detail. Somewhere between classic SNES era sprites and modern "retro" popular releases. And with new content arriving semi-frequently, they often go over old art and revamp them with even higher quality- also giving a reason to go back through the game to appreciate its assets.\nControls\nMoves like that of an SNES era action RPG, but more fluent with it's Controller Support, dodge/dash system and 8-way run freedom. Basically how you'd expect a 2D overhead Kingdom Hearts to perform.\nAudio\nWhat you'd expect of a fantasy sci-fi "retro" game, well performed music again like those of the SNES and Genesis era. The music fits each scenario well, and again like Kingdom Hearts, flows nicely in-and-out of Exploration and Battle to continuously give an action packed experience all 'round.\nContent\nContinuously added content since the game is still in development but with plenty of material to enjoy already, from free-exploration secrets treasures and powerups hidden throughout the world, challenging quests from NPCs, and very well designed Dungeons that offer a great challenge for both battle and puzzle lovers- the kind that you'd expect in the great 2D Zelda releases.\n\n\nWith tons of content being added regularly, buying this game to support the progress of the immediately gripping sci-fi fantasy world story is one of the best things you can do- and you won't regret it.","May 16","true","2.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You know what I'm talking about devs. (UNDERTALE)\n\nAlright, so I absolutly love this game. Why else would I have almost 200 hours in it? But what I found was really fun, was the  Apollo Battle , and I was there was a way to  fight with other avatars that level with you or re-do the battle  because the  battle with Apollo  was one most fun things. The battle system is really fun, even at a high level. And that's not it, not only are there puzzles that are fun, there are BOSS PUZZLES! Or just bosses where you have to do something to do another thing to damage the boss. There are also a ton of refrences to other games, mostly in the golden tier of trading items. There's also trading, which lets you go on a scavenger hunt for items! Or look them up... BUT SCAVENGER HUNT! Oh yeah, and you can party with... Avatars? Just one that I know of now.\n\nOverall I love this game to bits. Every. Single. PIXEL. And I've been playing since 0.4. This game is one of the most fun to play and I'm glad I came across it.

With the pace they are going at, I'm sure that it'll be finished by the end of the year.\n\nThe gameplay is solid and fun. It is the most well done combat sytem for an early access game. Most games will just throw in guns and say "shoot that bad guy" but Crosscode requires a perfect balance of dodging, blocking, and attacking. Many ways to do this formula are allowed because of the growing skill tree, which is already jam packed with more to come!\n\nThe music is perfect for what they are achieving. From the upbeat overworld songs to the intense boss themes, this game is solid in this area.\n\nThe one thing that may discourage people from getting this game is the story, which is not yet finished. I'll be honest, I get a bitter taste in my mouth when the story just ended, leaving me excited for more but also unsatisfied.\n\nSo to boil it down. Is this game worth your time in early access? The answer will be leaning to just waiting until the full release for story reasons. However if you just want to enjoy the small story, great combat, and killer soundtrack then I say that you need this game right now. Even if you decide that this game isn't for you, wait until full release and check it out again.\n\nRating: 8/10","April 3","true","9.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

See, I always wanted a game with this perfect style of pixel graphics and Kingdom Hearts-esque smoothness of gameplay. I got it now.\n\nStory 8/10\nNow listen - the story is not done yet, I can't judge it to its full potential yet. When I got up to the latest part that has been... storied, I almost cried. This is because I wanted to continue playing in its glorious splendor. It surprised me how well fleshed out the events and the dialogue were. It felt like I had been brought back to before the primary concern of making games was money games. It's very clear that real real thought has been put into the story. This rating can only climb.\n\nGameplay 10/10\nWhat can I say? It is the smoothest game I have ever played. The combat is fun. I like grinding in this game. That never EVER happens. I never genuinely enjoy grinding. This game has perfected 2D action. Seriously. Some AI needs a tiny bit of improvement for newcomers to sink into it softly, but it is going to be perfect. I assure you.\n\nCharacters/Environments etc. 10/10\nThe very real feeling world in the Croissant is absolutely beautiful and lively. It bustles as its creatures move around and it shines as clouds roll over the map. The Ys I-II-esque lighting effects perfectly compliment the beautiful lighting. The environments are mastered and fully enjoyable as even something to look at. The lively environments are well complimented by the alive feelign characters. The little tid-bits of language differences are used very well in compliment to the characters. Relationships are astounding. Every detail is thought out like a Patrick Rothfuss book.\n\nDevelopment 10/10\nTruly the best development team I've kept up with. They clearly have drive to make this game. It seems like the game existing is a dream of theirs, not a project. They work on it constantly, and have a friendly relationship with the players.\nRecently, they posted that they were delaying an update that almost 1.5's the content already in the game. I was distraught until I read that now it's coming out early may. This is actually pretty fast, needless to say.\n\n\nI imagine this game will be on my favourite list for years if not decades.\n\nIf you have a steam machine, play this game. If not, play it anyway, It's incredible.","April 5","true","29.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Really smart use of mechanics for puzzles as well. FFX-esque skill tree and hundreds of different pieces of equipment. Oh, and platforming. Lots of platforming <3\nStory/Plot: 10/10, futuristic setting with the trending "MMORPG simulation" anime archetype really well done. The characters are depicted exquisitely, with lots of charisma.\nDuration: 10/10, over 20h required to 100% all of the current content at the time of writing this review (which is like HALF of what the whole game is gonna have once it's finished).\nOverall: 10/10, you should definitely buy it or at least add it to your wishlist and get it once it's finished.

Very very good sountrack and sound design\n- Elements combine to make you feel like you are really playing inside the CrossWorlds MMO playground!\n\nOne of the most fully-featured, fun, and worthwhile "early access" titles I have ever purchased.\nWith an extension of the circuit "skill" upgrade tree and more movesets this game could very well be an instant classic. I do not think I have ever been so impressed with an early access title. They are often underdeveloped, with no clear direction. This game feels like a solid, complete idea. The only things that are missing are elements of the idea. The games theme, direction, and design are tied together in a unified and beautifully done product. The developers have truly created something that is a great addition to the RPG genre, it is incredibly unique and refreshing. It scratches every itch we RPG players have- except for maybe some sort of crafting system, but honestly the game doesn't NEED anything. It could be a nice addition though. I am so very excited to see what direction they take from here, and look forward to any future titles done by Radical Fish.\n\nGrade:\n\nAudio           -            9.5/10\nGraphics      -             10/10\nGameplay/Physics -  10/10 (indeed" buttery smooth" as described!)\nMechanics/RPG     -  9.5/10\nControls         -          10/10\nCompletion  -            10/10  (one of the most complete early access titles ever, aside from the storyline)\n","May 25","true","12.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

For such a start, it is incredibly fun. The first thing I really liked about it was how undemanding it was of your time. You can put it down and come back a week later without feeling that you've missed anything, or forgot what you were doing. The art is gorgeous, in the way that the Mana series was.\n\nThis is one of those games that I enjoy playing very late into the night by myself. I haven't played a game like since I was about 13.

The tight controls and a distinct combat system, combined with solid level design, makes for a very fun gameplay experience so far.  The demo gives a small glimps at a character system featuring all of the classic RPG elements, such as equipment, item, talents, stats, leveling up.  The narrative seen in the demo is just in the 'Okay' category, but it seems to be the least fleshed out part of this demo.

The tight controls and a distinct combat system, combined with solid level design, makes for a very fun gameplay experience so far.  The demo gives a small glimps at a character system featuring all of the classic RPG elements, such as equipment, item, talents, stats, leveling up.  The narrative seen in the demo is just in the 'Okay' category, but it seems to be the least fleshed out part of this demo.  It is probably best to just wait and experience the full game when it comes out, instead of paying for the privilage to be an alpha tester, but I am excitedly looking forward to that day after playing this demo.","February 9","true","3.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

(come on guys...)\n\nThis is a truly great game, I love the fact you're kind of going through an mmorpg type world trying to recover your lost memory and trying to act as a normal player the whole time. I believe the new update came out today or yesterday and I immediately downloaded it as soon as I seen it. I just now got to the end of the realeased (so far) story and with the PvP fight I was 3 levels below that other guy and we were tied needing only one more round to win the game. I was ONE hit away from dieing and (like I mentioned above) I won because I used the SP moves and knocked him away putting him open for a final attack.\n\nI cannot WAIT for the next update please get it out soon.\n\n10/10 will reccomend to my friends.","February 10","true","5.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ajjajaperu/recommended/368340/","ajjajaperu","rey de low priority","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ajjajaperu/","124 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nthis game is great, can't wait for the full release!\n\n0.6.1 patch UPDATE\nokay, so now we have two dungeons, three functional towns, and a whole bunch of other space.\n\npositives\n-music is catchy and fits with the areas that they're assigned to! battle music could use some work, but the ambient music is spot on for the most part\n-graphics are clear and crisp, making the fast gameplay easy to read, avoiding frustration from an abundance of effects and stuff like that\n-puzzling is for the most part enjoyable. Personally, the ice temple was impressive to me, it offered a wide range of different puzzles from the standard "reflect the light" kinda puzzle to more complex movement based puzzles\n-combat is fun for the most part, although some enemies are really annoying in the later parts of the game. Everything from the end of the ice temple and before (about 80% of the game at this point) was fun to fight and had dynamic systems which rewarded certain playstyles.\n-movement, like combat, is fluid and responsive. The movement, in tandem with the ambient music and the graphics, make exploring the world a joy.\n\nnegatives\n-enemies post ice temple are idiotic. Flying enemies that you can only hit once every 25 seconds completely ruin the pacing of the game and there needs to be either a way to ground them (that is more obvious if it's already in the game) or just be removed outright..\n-the story really needs to be reexamined. Initially when crosscode came out it kinda seemed like it was going to be a cyberpunkesc gamem, but now i'm not so sure... the beta/alpha has next to no story exposition after the intro/first 3 hours, so honestly i can't tell if they just intend to leave it completely sparse or if they are going to fill it in.. I really hope they consider hiring a writer or actually putting a story in, because as is the "hehe we're an mmo aren't we so witty?" exposition is going to be unpalatable if there isn't a REALLY dark cyberpunk undertone to it with actual death and despair.. I understand that the dev team aren't writers by profession, but this game would be such a waste if they ruined it with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ story. also, we need cooler characters. stop with the cheese. cheese is only good when there are actual characters there to respond to it.. Like, the first mission of the game is in a traditional japanese style fortress, and it's AWESOME. Then it hits a really high note, aaaaaaaaand then exposition falls off the face of the (cross)world.\n-the trading system is also kinda dumb.. it's kinda based on a component system (with a gold system on the side), so you can go out into the world and get components from the enviornment and mobs ala a real rpg, and then you can trade those up for better components at specific vendors to trade to OTHER vendors to get equipment. Functionally, what happens is you have to 1. find an item that you want to make, 2. memorize the components required, 3. find the vendor that will synthesize the higher componenets required, 4. memorize those requirements, 5. go out into the world and find all of the components.. it just takes a while and it's a huge pain in the ♥♥♥, but i can see the potential for some hidden vendors/equipment creators that could potentially make it cool. Honestly, i wish they would add stuff to the map showing where vendors are and what they sell after you discover them. Then have a little intro to the system at the start of the game where you have to go through all the steps.\n-some gear effects need to be explained in the synopsis section of the game\n\n~~~\nSo in closing, it may sound like i have issues with this game, but honestly it's just because I love it. It has such potential, and I really do have a lot of faith in the developers because they seem like genuinely passionate people. The game itself is easily worth 20 dollars, so please give it a shot! i hope they fix the stuff that i brought up, because if they do crosscode could probably be up there with some of my favorite games! also, devs, please release an ost when the game "comes out!" please an thanks!","February 6","true","11.5"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

It has huge potential, but, right now, also includes few major problems:\n1. Controls. Currently, there is only one gamepad control scheme. And it feels bad - not like controls in "SNES-styled" game should be\n2. Graphics. Dont read it wrong - I love it's style. Problem in low quality sprites. Rlly. Game looks cool only on screenshots and in HD-sized window. Otherways - prepare to enjoy soapy soap on any settings.\n3. Perfomance. Actually its not game's problem, but Chrome's (its html5 game) - it uses software rendering instead of hardware one, so - glorious 30fps included.\n\nBut wait - its only early access! I believe, devs will fix listed troubles and release polished game. But, right now, refunded. If smthing will change - I ll grab it again and rewrite review.","February 25","false","0.6"," 17 of 91 people (19%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","19","17","91","5","16"

The 8 directional controls are smooth as silk, and the combat system is a challenging but well balanced blend of ranged and melee, against a variety of enemies with equally varying behaviors in an interesting world with a refreshing plot and setting.\n\nThe game also manages to incorporate a 3d enviroment where you can hop up onto ledges of varying heights and leap across gaps to parkour and make use of the terrain to survive against enemy ai of higher levels.\n\nQuick reflexes on the keyboard and mouse are required, but the controls are instinctive and easy to use. (Mastering them, on the other hand, is a different matter :D)\n\nWhen I first found this game for free online in its original demo form, I was very disappointed to find it was only a demo, and was afraid that it would never go anywhere. But then, months later low and behold I found it on steam, and didn't hesitate to buy it. I was overjoyed at the progress that had been made, and eagerly look forward to seeing future updates.","November 4, 2015","true","11.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
