Objective release the hare from his cage freeing him from the magician.\n\nWhat a tough little puzzle game this is.  I truly enjoyed the challenge.  Everything occurs in a single room much like Please, Don't Touch Anything occurs on a single console.  A little point and click and a lot of puzzles: picture puzzles, sliders, and logic.  Excellent game.\n\nWarning: Skipping a puzzle results in permenantly locked achievements and I will not get into the debate over the developers' personal opinion about the fact they consider skipping a puzzle cheating.  As of April 29, 2016 with the purchase of DLC Hare in the Hat: The Abyss this permenantly locked condition is released.  Reset game and try again for the achievements.\n\nThe slider picture puzzle is Hell.  But I figured it out eventually (after several hours).  I earned the SHUFFLE achievement.  HINT: Use the center top or center bottom of the puzzle, not the sides or the middle to complete.  I used the center top, and two 'diamonds'.  It was the only place I could find to reverse those last two tiles.\n\nOn April 29 2016 the DLC Hare in the Hat: The Abyss was added.  Objective: Free the hare from the confines of his underwater containment.\n\nNot as hard as the first game and focuses solely on the mini-games and puzzles.  Still a challenge though.  Puzzles include sliders, matching, brain teasers and basic logic.\n\nPuzzle from HELL this time is called Hungarian Rings.  Basically put the colors in the correct place in two interlocking movable rings.  I skipped it after an hour and the beginnings of  migraine.  Did not lock the achievements for the other puzzles but no achievement for that puzzle since I skipped.  I can live with that.\n\nRecommend this add-on.  It is just as fun and challenging as the first game.","February 7","true","9.3"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","17","17","0","0"

In other words, you're no more banned. But my opinion about how it was handled stays.\n\nHare in the Hat is a short yet frustrating puzzle game where you have to free the hare owned by a magician. For that, you'll have to solve puzzles, find clues and pray that you'll not throw your computer out of the window.\n\nWhy am I insisting? In reality, the puzzles aren't hard to figure. You can go by trial and errors without problems. But there is one puzzle, with swapping pieces, where you'll end up with only two pieces to switch and not managing to do so. I suppose that I uninstalled at that point the first time I've played it. Don't try to find a walkthrough, the puzzle is random.\n\nHowever, the developer added achievements and trading cards, prompting me to come back and beat finally the game. The famous puzzle was a pain in the ♥♥♥ but I was very very happy when I managed to push through it without skipping. Because skipping a puzzle here is not at all recommended unless you have unlocked all the achievements safe for the skipping one.\n\nThe developer is perhaps doing what he wants with his game. But punishing players that are skipping puzzles because he's under the impression that they're cheating, with a puzzle known to give white hair to everyone (the swap one), where you just want to skip after 30 minutes - 1 hour passed on it, after frustration and that you just want to come back after unlocking the rest... I don't agree with that. Why am I saying that? Skip a level and you will never be able to unlock the rest of achievements unless you buy the future DLC/the DLC is out, I still didn't understand that. I'm quite scared now to skip a level to reach 100% achievements.\n\nAnyway, it's a dangerous point of view to consider that people skipping are cheaters. I've skipped puzzles before after spending time on them. I don't fall under the category of people skipping everything. It's probably the biggest negative point for the game.\n\nAnother problem is the flickering of the screen that happened a lot, especially when in Steam overlay.\n\nOtherwise, the graphics are quite colorful and amusing, the soundtrack is good though the main sound is kinda annoying (I speak about the clicking) - I suppose that's why I disabled the audio the first time.\n\nFor the price, you can go ahead if you love puzzles. I will not put a thumb down because I disagree with the developer's point of view for an achievement as the rest of the game is good. But be warned anyway.","January 9","true","4.5"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","19","21","2","0"

But at least it is really cheap.\n\nLong version:Hare in the Hat is your typical few-dollar tablet game. No story, no voices, no instructions, just one scene which gives you access to a bunch of puzzles.\nThe minigames themselves are standard everyday brain twisters. Some are childishly easy. Others can permanently get you stuck. And none of them can be skipped.\nMost of the game time is spent by either scavenging for a new item, or by solving the tougher puzzles, like the chess minigame. But if you know what to do already, it is roughly ten minutes long, or even shorter.\nIf you don’t mind spending a little money on some puzzles, get it, but you won’t miss anything by skipping this one.","July 2, 2015","true","4.2"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","13","14","0","5"

The game consists in only one location that contains different clickable objects that trigger the mini-games. There is no story attached to it and no cut scenes. And even though the game has an ending, the fact that it is comprised of only one scene suggests that this was designed more like a demo or as a first chapter of a longer game.\n\nThe puzzles’ difficulty vary from the easy jigsaw puzzle to some really challenging ones, for example a chess variation or rotating 4 pieces puzzles. Despite the fact that some of them have a brief indication about what you're expected to do, there is no other hint option or skip button. On the other hand, having hints and skip buttons would considerably decrease the gameplay hours since 90% of the time is spent on trying to solve those difficult puzzles. I personally got stuck a couple of times and I gave up for the moment, but then I went back to the game and eventually completed it. There are no available walkthroughs at the moment online, so you can’t rely on them to save you.\n\nI didn’t encounter any bugs while playing the game, although a lot of people are complaining about crashes.\n\nIf your idea of fun is solving challenging puzzles, then this game is definitely for you and you should buy it, especially while it is 40% discounted. But if you’d rather play it with a guide nearby, then this game might end up being quite consuming or frustrating for you.\n\nMore reviews on the Lilly's Corner Curator page","April 5, 2015","true","5.1"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","11","12","0","1"

There's no indication of where to start or what to do next but that don't really matter since everything happens in one room. Just click around and see what happens.\nSome puzzles are very easy and some are hard but not impossible to do. Some of the clues (click on a question mark) don't really make sense and despite knowing what to do you can still get stuck. Again, no puzzle is impossible.\n\nThis is not a good game for achievement hunters. There are currently 16 normal achievement (you get most of them by finishing puzzles) and 1 hidden achievement. The hidden one is for "cheaters", you can get it by skipping a puzzle but (and here's the bad thing) it will lock out your ability to get 100% if you haven't already gotten the other 16. Your ability to gain achievements again will be unlocked by buying the DLC, whenever that comes out. Yeah, no. Bad. Skipping a puzzle because it's too hard or you're stuck is not cheating, it's skipping a hard puzzle. The "developer" added it just to punish achievement hunters. Cheating is using a program to unlock achievements without really playing the game. See the difference? The "developer" don't.\nEDIT: Supposedly you won't get locked out of achievement hunting ATM if you get the "cheater" achievement before the DLC arrives but I'll wait to get it until all future achievements are active/collected.\n\nUnfortunately, I'm an achievement hunter. I got this game on sale today because it was cheap, I was in the mood for puzzles and new achievements. I haven't done the "cheater" achievement yet (EDIT 2: I have now), luckily I read about it in the forum (after getting the game, though :P ). The game is cheap, I got it on sale and hopefully the DLC will be cheap too but without any future "punishments" from the "developer" because I like 100% achievements in my games. I won't refund though, because it's not actually a bad game (as in filled with bugs, stuttering, doesn't really work etc). If you like puzzles and don't really care about achievements (or a story) then this is a good game to spend an hour on.\n\nI give this a thumb down mostly because of the "cheater" achievement but also because of the shortness of the game, the lack of story and lack of proper clues. The puzzles themselves were, for the most part, good but not enough to give this a thumb up.","October 11, 2015","false","6.7"," 20 of 30 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","20","30","0","3"

Both on my previous and my new laptop, the game crashes every couple of minutes, making the game fairly unplayable.  There has been no official reply or feedback on the issue which several people have mentioned in the forums.  Although the game does autosave nicely, meaning no lost progress when there's a crash, the sheer frequency of crashing still makes the game frustrating and unplayable.\n\nThere is also a lack of a skip button, which would've been helpful as the game crashed repeatedly during one of the puzzles, and there was a point where I would've liked to just skip over it and progress onwards.  A skip feature is sometimes considered a cheat and not all games offer it, but where there are seriously gameplay and stability issues, it would have made it more bearable.\n\nSo all said, this game gets filed under "Meh" and will not be touched again unless there is significant updating and/or bugfixing.  The game was cheap, so I don't feel overly cheated, but I certainly won't support this developer any more unless there's a dramatic increase in stability.

Skipping puzzle is not cheating, and to prevent players skip puzzle, I think it would have been better with "finish the game without skipping any puzzle" achievement, rather than cheating achievement and then locks all other achievements.\n\nWell, I think I'll just give a thumbs up for fun puzzle, easy achievements and trading cards. I hope the devs won't add more achievement due to DLC release and can only unlocked if the DLC is purchased.\n\nTips: Finish the game without skipping any puzzle should get you 16/17 achievements. Then play it again, and skip the puzzle to get the last cheating achievement.","December 9, 2015","true","4.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

These have to be solved in order, and after an hour or so the hare is free. What looks like a game for kids is in actuality a diverse combinaton of puzzles which need to be solved by logic, trial and error, or sheer luck (e.g. the fish tank magnet), and that range from very easy to very difficult (the forum has a very useful post on the swap puzzle, thanks to graewynd). There's also a fair amount of clicking around to even find the next active puzzle to solve. There is no backstory to speak of, and no reward for completing it.\n\nTo sum it up: it is rather short and rather annoying (what is the next puzzle? and the difficulty fluctuations), and not worth your time.

I'm sure some people will do it on their first try in less time than that.  If you know what you're getting for your <$2, it's really good.  Its crisp artwork and responsive puzzles are just right for a short puzzler.  It isn't really a hidden object game in any traditional sense, in that you never have a list of objects to find in a cluttered scene.  It is way more consistent with mobile games of the room escape genre, except there's just one room populated by a few longer puzzles of the traditional varieties: towers of Hanoi, jigsaw, and sliding block games, plus a chess puzzle that isn't entirely clear but not too hard to work out if you know how chess pieces move.

Unlike some point and clicks the items you find have a logical use and I didn't need to use a herring on a big tree.\n\nThe one downside I would say is that having completed the game, my play time is 46 minutes. This may be increased by others as I was familiar with all of the puzzles and how they work, but I wouldn't see anyone getting more than a couple of hours out of this.\n\nThe downside mentioned is counteracted, of course, by the price. I bought it on sale for £0.95 and I certainly got more enjoyment out of it then a cup of tea I could buy with that change.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this to those who enjoy escape the room games, but it is nothing too special or grand.

The game takes place in only single location and doesn't really have any story at all. All you are doing is solving puzzle games that give you items to be used in other puzzles. The puzzle minigames themshelves are well done, but also feel completly arbitary, there is no rhyme or reason to what items they provide you with. The whole theme of freeing that rabbit isn't integrated into the flow of puzzle solving at all.\n\nThe game also doesn't do a great job at explaining itself, it just throws you into a room with no explanation. Clicking on things lacks audible feedback, so you often wonder if the game is broken and ignoring you clicks or if you are doing something wrong. I also had a technical issue where the game wouldn't play any sound at all and clicking the sound-icon didn't do anything to reenabling it, after a few restarts that however solve itself.\n\nAside from the lack of story, the weakest part in this game is the music, its not very good and also very erradic, sometimes you don't have any music for a while, then it comes back again. There is also a radio-puzzles where the music plays right over the sounds coming out of the radio, as it turns out the puzzle doesn't depend on the sound, but having those playing at the same time was irretating nontheless.\n\nOverall its an ok game, but it's less then an hour long and the lack of any kind of story is really holding it back.","June 6, 2015","false","3.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It was a short yet interesting sequence of puzzles - some very easy, some others a little bit more difficult but never impossible to solve on your own - that costed me less than one Euro, gave me 4 cards to resell, kept me entertained for one hour and gave me achievements.\nWhy am I red-flagging it, then? Why am I not recommending it?\nBecause of the achievements design. Yes, a fairly good game that otherwise would get a solid 7/10 is mercilessy flagged as a fail, and all because of some minor/secondary elements like the achievements.\nBut the way they were implemented is so ill-chosen... so WRONG... that I have no choice but doing that.\n\nPractices and decisions like this one, while certainly original and probably made in good faith, have to be killed before they grow adults.\n\nBasically, the game has one achievement for each puzzle in the game. You solve the puzzle, you get the achievement. Easy  peasy. You can also skip a puzzle if you just can't solve it. Why, thanks dev. I like to have fun to play games and if I stop having fun trying (and inexorably failing) to beat a puzzle\level\enemy I like to be able to skip the whole thing in order to keep doing other things that I like more. So when I bumped into what I consider the most difficult puzzle of this game and after I tried (and inexorably failed) to beat it for 35 minutes... I decided to skip it.\n"I won't get the achevement for this, not a big issue", I thought.\nOnly it revealed to be a BIG issue.\nBecause if you skip one game you are marked A CHEATER and, from that point on, you are not able to get ANY other achievement. Never again. Even if you restart the game. Even if you reinstall the game. I don't even.\nI'm not an achievement hunter but I like to mantain my average game completion rate constant and getting a 5/17 was very different than the 16/17 I thought I would get... so I kept trying and trying and trying... and failing and failing... and swearing... and eventually I succeded but I stopped enjoying the game as a whole.\n\nEnglish is not my first language and maybe I can't properly explain HOW ATROCIOUS I think this design choice is. It does not make sense in ANY way you try to consider it.\n- I skip ONE puzzle out of 14 and I am a cheater? Are you kidding me?\n- I skip one puzzle but I don't get achievements for puzzles that I don't skip? What?\n- Your explanation for all of this cr*p is that you worked hard for months and you don't want players to rush to the end? This is the biggest bul**hit of them all. Just implement a different kind of achievements then. Or don't implement a UI skip button but some more hidden I-have-to-manually-edit-the-savegame way to skip the puzzles instead, making who does that an ACTUAL cheater.\nOr maybe you can just stop trying and NOT implementing achievements next time. It's a win-win, believe me.","January 23","false","2.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/obsidian_age/recommended/359810/","obsidian_age","Obsidian Age","http://steamcommunity.com/id/obsidian_age/","1718 products in account","Hare In The Hat is a nice and short puzzle game. You solve puzzles that unlock compartments in objects and reveal items used to solve further puzzles. I would liken it to The Room, in terms of its core gameplay. The only problem is that it is far shorter and costs more than The Room. When I say that the Hare In The Hat is short, I mean that it will only take you roughly a single hour to complete the entire game, without any walkthrough or knowledge of what you have to do. On top of that, more than half of that time will be spent on one single puzzle - the sliding puzzle.\n\nThe achievements all follow linear progression... except for one, which has a *really* strange twist. One of the achievements you *have* to obtain last if you want 100% completion. It marks your account as a cheater, and from that point on you will *never* be able to get the other achievements, even after completely reinstalling the game! I have over 1,000 games in my library, and have *never* seen this in any other game. I am *not* a fan of this strange decision!\n\nThis game was initially made for iPhone, as is evident in the screenshot which is randomly included at the end of the trailer video. Simply porting a game from iPhone to Steam and charging $2 for it is a bit much. They didn't even do a good job with the port. The only option is full-screen, which renders strangely on my laptop. It *is* possible to change the resolution by piping through a launch command, but if this functionality is available... why couldn't they add an option *in-game*?\n\nIn summary, Hare In The Hat is a fun game, but considering how short it is, it is really not worth the price. Be *vary* wary of this game if you are a completionist! I got it as part of a bundle, and if you are lucky enough to, it's well worth giving a shot. If you are looking for a standalone puzzle game however, I'd have to recommend The Room instead.\n\nThere is a post about the 'Cheater' achievement over at http://steamcommunity.com/app/359810/discussions/0/487870763300646350/. Having read it I have serious doubts as to the integrity of the intentions of the developers of Hare In The Hat. "If you cheated once and spit on my efforts on making this game, I see no reason to make anything for you. No game reset should clean it. If you don't like it - don't cheat... That's my game and if you don't like my rules - get you refund and get out" - Nomad (a developer)\n\n*Purely* based on Nomad's comments in that thread I am not only giving Hare In The Hat a negative review, but actively recommend that no-one gives these developers any money. Treating paying customers like that is deplorable.","February 25","false","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Clicking on an object will zoom in and allow us to inspect the scene further, sometimes we'll be able to interact with something in a very limited way, sometimes not, until we find the right item to use on it later, but it's up to us to figure out how to gradually peel away the layers of puzzles presented to us and eventually release the poor, iddle-widdle bunny-wunny.\n\nI really like how open this is. That we can examine everything and try to figure out for ourselves what our actions should be, rather than have a completely linear, signposted experience. Though I can also see that being a major issue for some people's progression as they'll click furiously around everything they can see, all the while being completely oblivious as to what the next step to be carried out should be. But I guess that's all part of the intended challenge. Otherwise, while there are one or two puzzles that may confuse or frustrate, and they really could have explained some of them a little better (I totally fluked my way through the coin puzzle at the end), for the most part the majority of players should be able to find their way through the game without too much hassle.\n\nThe look of the game is all pretty pleasant, maybe even "cute" in its own little way, though the music leaves a little to be desired, as it plays for a moment, stops inexplicably, then starts again a few minutes later just as suddenly as it went. But as with the visuals, it's a nice enough little piano ditty carrying us through the game that, other than its jarring abruptness, has its own little charms to it that are hard to dislike.\n\nAside from a few minor bumps along the road of progression, it's a pretty brief experience, maybe an hour or so for most, I'd imagine, and if anything, will take you longer to farm for trading cards than to actually complete. But it's a nice, fun, pleasant, cheap little number that just about any puzzle fan should be able to enjoy.","April 9","true","10.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Probably not everyone's cup of tea, but for fans of genre worth checking out.","April 10","true","4.9"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"
