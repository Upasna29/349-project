I'm not a huge fan of the execution, the gimmick of button spamming wears off quickly and on some songs it can be frustrating when it registers something on the near opposite side of the keyboard against a single note that is happening simultaneously, giving you a bad rating. I would probably prefer a more specific input requirement and perhaps a cap on the sustains to discourage cheating/scripting for high scores. As it stands, the controls are too loose and while you are judged on timing, its just not as engaging as a standard beatmatching game like Beatmania, Osu, DDR, etc.\n\nI could accept it an an early access title but as a full release I'm just not seeing the value beyond the soundtrack. It also seems to crash after playing 2-3 songs, though I'm sure it will be fixed eventually.\n\nIts also worth mentioning the resolution is severely limited to a maximum of 1280x960.","September 25, 2015","false","0.4"," 43 of 51 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","43","51","2","0"

The songs are full of life, albeit short, and the graphics are very reminiscent of games like Beatmania IIDX 15: DJ TROOPERS and Frequency. The real annoyances of the first release (as of this review's post date) is that there are only 16 playable tracks, and Edit Mode is still unavailable. I would still recommend this game to rhythm-enthusiastic testers that are willing to try something new. The only thing I'd ask is that you purchase this game a bit after it brings new updates.","September 26, 2015","true","1.1"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","82","9","11","3","0"

Hacker aesthetics? Japanese rhythm game? Keyboard play? Sounds badass, wow, yeah?\n\nUnfortunately, the magic ends there.\n\nIt's hard for me to reccomend this. I only played it for a few minutes but it's not really drawing me in. Rhythm games are supposed to draw you in. At the lower difficulties you get a feel for the pace and progression seems natural. Beyond the tutorial this game doesn't have that. You're supposed to get a feel for the rhythm of things on a basic starting level. This game doesn't have that.\n\nA rhythm game should make you feel and look cool and badass at the higher difficulty levels. This does neither. I feel like a tool while playing this. And after just a few minutes I feel like progressing any further is literally gonna give me carpal tunnel. You're better off playing Stepmania or k-shoot mania (a free PC sim for Sound Voltex. It's like what Stepmania is for Dance Dance Revolution) KSM/SDVX especially has the tunnel effect/guitar hero notechart perspective that American players are more used to. Hell, take a book from Harmonix's Amplitude and Frequency. This? Eh.....\n\nI wish this was better. I want it to be better. I want it to improve, but I don't think that's going to happen without a massive overhaul of the engine and retooling of gameplay and difficulty. Sorry guys.","December 28, 2015","false","0.4"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

It makes my eyes bleed.\n\nThe concept was interesting and that is why I purchased this. I severely regret that decision. A halfbaked rythm game that falls short on every front. The music is terrible. I would say something akin to "Human Music" from Rick and Morty but that would be an affront to "Human Music". The controls are lazy and ill-defined, "Mash your keyboard on the left or right then hit enter" is hardly a control scheme for a good rythm game.\n\nThis game is hardly clever and the "Hacker Theme" is nonexistant. Terrible game, and I hate myself more every time I see this game in my inventory.","January 29","false","0.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The gameplay style is unique (hitting different sections of the keyboard, any key in that section will trigger the note), the music is pretty good, and they just updated with 3 new songs and an edit mode to make your own note tracks for .wav files on your computer!\nIt has a fairly low difficulty, which I consider a positive aspect, but hitting every note with the correct timing for a high combo chain is still very tricky.\n\nThe game feels great, and I don't think it would have been out of place next to REZ on the dreamcast. It has the same imprecise but satisfying feel, and if people make custom tracks for the game I think I'll be playing it for a long time.","April 3","true","1.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
