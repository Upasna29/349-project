But this game most definitely does no live up to its predecsors. The gameplay is boring, the dialogues aren't funny, and it didn't run as smoothly as the other games. Most all of my favorites aspects from the previous games were missing from this game. As a side note, they also had a different voice actor for Sam. While it bothered my nostalgia, it didn't at all contribute to my raiting of the game. Go play other Pajama Sam games, but I'd recommend skipping this one.","June 21, 2014","false","1.9"," 28 of 35 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","28","35","0","0"

It is a giant piece of sadness. They spent no time on the diolouge or story, and changed the voice actor. They spent NO effort at all, syncing the words to the character. Sams mouth just keeps cycling through set motions while the voice makes no such sounds. The frames are choppy, resolution crappy, you can no longer skip diaolauge with esc, its just a big mess. I wish i would have listen to all the other reviews saying the same as me instead of hoping to simply look past the 'few' issues. ...There is no looking past this.... Its worse than any cheap indie game.","April 12, 2015","false","0.7"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","18","19","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ConanHuynh/recommended/292820/","ConanHuynh","ConanHuynh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ConanHuynh/","115 products in account","This game is not too shabby, good even.\n\nPajama Man's show just ended. Sam is about to turn of the television until he sees the credits - an autograph from Pajama Man himself at the mall! Joyous, Sam asks his mom if he can go, and she says yes, telling him to bring something to sign for his favorite hero. He finds a special edition comic book after a brief search. As Sam reaches for the comic book, it is sucked down in a pile. Pajama Sam dives in to retrieve back his possession. That's where the adventure begins.\n\nAs the fourth installment in the series, people expect the game to live up to its reputation. Does it? Not quite.\n-The voice actor for Pajama Sam contrasts its predecessors. Once you hear a voice that sticks out, it's memorable. Fortunately for us, we all loved the original voice actor. Although this one shows satisfactory, it's just not up to par.\n-I don't know about anyone else, but the game is choppy when I move from map to map. This diminishes the overall fluidity of the game.\n-Collecting items. In Pajama Sam One, you collected socks. Pajama Sam Two, puzzle pieces. Three, box tops. Here, you collect these trading cards. These aren't bad. I actually like them. It's just the AMOUNT you have to collect. Essentially every place you go to has a card lying around. Like with the mini glitches stated in the previous statement, the collection of trading card simply reduces the flow of movement.\n-There aren't many objects you can click on anymore, and if you do, it's passable. One of the things I clicked on was some kind of poster in the first map of the main game. When I did, it just changed. No movement. No animation. Nothing. As a child, I loved looking at everything popping out of the screen. Don't get me wrong, there are some good ones out there. Just not as much.\n-This is a little detail, but saving the game bugs me. With the other Pajama Sam adventures, you saved and went about with your business. Now, we have Sam telling us what to do. At first, it was charming. Then, it turned annoying real soon.\n-The game in general doesn't make sense. In the previous three games, they all had a theme, and they all logically made sense. In No Need to Hide When It's Dark Outside, it was about darkness. In Thunder and Lightning Aren't so Frightening, it was about weather. In You Are What You Eat From Your Head to Your Feet, it was about food. In Life Is Rough When You Lose Your Stuff, it was about...well, stuff. Why do we need a shirt, some socks, and some shoes to meet Pajama Man?\n-Back to the previous thought, a lot of the characters contribute little to the theme. I felt they were placed there just for show instead of adding value. They did little to push the game in the right direction.\n\nOkay, so aside from all the substandard effort put forth, some good came out.\n-The different pathways continued in this game. This is a point-and-click adventure, and I welcomed exploring the various routes.\n-I liked the "Part Two" side of this game. It's in the Freddi Fish and SPY Fox series. In the Freddi Fish and SPY Fox games, once you were done with your main objective, there was a little more you needed to do in order to fix the problem. In this Pajama Sam game, you experienced a little of that magic in this game.\n-Probably the idea I liked most was you can try more items to other items. Before, in the other games, if something didn't work, Sam would say "That's not going to help" or "I don't think that's going to do me any good." Now, you can do some trial and error. I won't try to spoil too much, but there's one part with fireflies. I tried catching them with a jar, but they wouldn't be able to breathe. I tried catching them with a net, but they were too small. The options available allowed me to think, and I enjoyed the puzzle-solving.\n\nAs a whole, Life Is Rough When You Lose Your Stuff is not a bad game. It's a charming, fun game with interesting characters, designs, and effects. With that being said, its performance compared to its older installments puts the Pajama Sam series to shame. This is a fantastic game for those who never received a chance to play with any of the Humongous Entertainment games, but for veteran players such as myself, this game will dust in my Steam library.","July 5, 2014","false","1.7"," 25 of 32 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","25","32","0","0"

As a childhood fan of all of the Humongous games (Freddie Fish, Spy Fox, etc.), I wish this game wasn't created just as much as I wish Indiana Jones 4 wasn't created. The lip syncing is horrendous, the movement from map to map is terrible, you can't end scenes whenever you want and the beginning of the game leads off with a super long song. All of the voices sound like someone made it in their basement and all of the characters you run into are uninteresting. Pajama Sam doesn't have the same voice and neither the actress who plays him or the script written for him is able to capture his personality at all.\n\n\nI'm going to pretend this game never happened...","December 16, 2014","false","0.2"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","15","17","3","1"

What they did with these changes is what let me down. When I played through the past three games, they each had a flowing and organic theme to them. One that kids could relate to and it felt like an experience and achievement. There was great care taken into the details, voice work, the style. Even the musical placement. I did not, however, get the same feeling from this game. It felt like a game that was constructed by a paint by numbers manual. A song goes here, a puzzle goes there, hey this voice is silly- throw it here. I'm not angry...Just very disappointed. I looked forward to playing another sequel of the little boy named Pajama Sam. The one who "Always helps those in need".

One of these things is Sam should sound right (voiced by Pamela Adlon) but for whatever reason Pajama Sam is voiced now by Elisha Ferguson. This is extremely disorienting. Ruin the game disorienting. Elisha Ferguson makes Sam sound very feminine, enough that Megan and I started referring to "her" as Pajama Samantha. PJ Sam 4 also has less things to click on, like in old PJ Sam games you could click a leaf and it would transform into a flower (or whatever) , this generally doesn't happen in PJ Sam 4. The collectibles (trading cards) are kinda cool though\n\nCurrently taking around 2-3 hours for two late teens to finish so it would be even longer for young kids.\n\nAs a game by itself it's an OK point and click kids game.

This game is ABSOLUTE RUBBISH. I thought the re-dub of Spy Fox in Dry Cereal was terrible. Not only is this the worst voice acted HE game I've ever played (And I played them all, sans this one), its also the worst designed. The world is absolute rubbish, and not just because it happens in the land of garbage. After coming from the food world of Pajama Sam 3: You are what you eat from your head to your feet, which was brilliantly made, this feels like it should have been the prototype before the first Putt Putt and Fatty Bear games.

But I completely disagree on that remark as this game is just as enjoyable as the previous three installments. In the fourth and final game, Sam (who isn't voiced by Pamela Adlon) learns that Pajama Man(which is actually a guy in a mascot costume) is giving out autographs at the local mall. Sam knows that his first issue of Pajama Man comic series is the prefect item to get signed. Only problem is that his room is a mess and couldn't find it. So once again he imagines that he "visits" a ficitional land. In this case it's a junk land where Sam encounters all sorts of characters and creatures. The thing I love about this game is that it explores the Pajama Man series more with the info of the characters on the trading cards you collect throughout the game. A lot of the cards reference characters and items mentioned by Sam in the previous installments. Which gives the Pajama Man character a sense of history to him. Overrall this game isn't as bad as people claim it to be, plus it be a bit hard to come up with newer ideas had this series went on longer. So the idea of exploring the Pajama Man universe and backstories is a logical choice to conclude this franchise. If you loved the first three games, give this one a chance cause it's far from being bad or boring.","April 23, 2015","true","2.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I do not recommend it at all. It is a disappointment to the entire Pajama Sam franchise.\n\nThe voice actor changed, and whereas voice actors do change from time to time, it's still a little upsetting.\nI noticed in the beginning of this game, Sam acted like such a big baby. This is something that is quite annoying.\nAnother thing is that you can not use the Esc key to skip scenes or dialouge. You can, however, use the Enter key. Which I did find useful. One of the very few things I enjoyed about the game.\nOverall, it does not play smoothly. It is very choppy, and freezes for a short period of time when you enter an area (by hitting Enter).\n\nThe things I did enjoy, like I said, wasn't much. It sill semi-felt like Pajama Sam. It had a good idea of using Lost Items. I enjoyed the world. The puzzles were a little interesting, and a couple of them were actually challenging. I couldn't figure them out myself!\n\nAll in all, I do not recommend this game. Do not buy it, unless it comes in the Pajama Sam Complete Pack(if you go to buy that)!","July 31, 2015","false","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This installment, helmed by Atari after their purchase of the company, sometimes manages to have dialogue that can be funny, but fails in every other aspect.\n\nI don't need to be one of the many people who has blasted the voice-acting of this game, however, after playing this game and attempting to play it again for the sake of review, I would fell empty to not mention how horrible this voice acting is. Sam sounds far too young, and barely has much power behind his voice. He is far from the only one with bad vocie acting, among a slew of obnoxious characters even small children could easily find annoying.\n\nThe plot for Pajama Sam games where usually easy accuses that make sense, yet this one somehow messes that up. It makes no sense and feels rushed, and the game itself is littered with not just confusing choices, but bugs. My second try end only ten minutes in after a bug broke the mouse. I do not understand how a point-and-click adventure game can make the mouse stop working, and yet that's exactly what happened with this game.\n\nLife Is Rough When You Lose Your Stuff is a buggy and annoying mess that should not be played. Do not buy this game for your children, and do not believe that it is good simply because of the previous installments, which thankfully hold up incredibly well.","February 29","false","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As other players have noted, yes, the original voice actress (whose name I have totally forgotten right now) is not voicing Sam, so he has a VERY difference voice. It's a bit of a jarring change. I can ignore it, but I know it may bother others. Overall, the art style and music is different (which kind of makes sense given the time gap between this game and the third), which isn't necessarily AWFUL by itself, but both seem less zany than the previous games. Upsettingly, the dialogue isn't as fun or quirky as the last few games either, and the voice delivery is as flat as the dialogue, so that's another strike against it.\n\nOn a technical level, this Steam version, for me, had very laggy cutscenes where the audio would occasionally cut out for some lines. I actually own this on the original CD too, and I don't remember such problems for that. Additionally, the gameplay is also noticeably laggier (even on aforementioned CD). When moving from A to B, the screen pauses with an image of Sam exiting before popping over to the new screen instead of smooth transitions seen in other Humongous Entertainment games. Even the speaking in non-cutscenes is laggy.\n\nI think the plot still fits with the general feel of the Pajama Sam series (the end progression is weird, though), and I like the trading card system (but I'm also a giant nerd for cards), but the different execution makes the game feel very, very different from its predecessors and not in the best way. It's a love-hate relationship, I guess. Also, the drawer game is stupidly easy. Like, what? And the Bejeweled game also feels laggy as hell. Sigh.\n\nTL;DR: I recommend the game because I like the series, but it is VERY different from the other Pajama Sam games. Kind of flat and lackluster, but not terrible. If you love those, you will probably dislike this one for its changes, unless you can make yourself look past them. There are lag issues, however, that are really annoying no matter how you look at it.","May 10","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
