"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ux92/recommended/9000/","ux92","Hola Uriberto","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ux92/","1255 products in account","Spear of Destiny is one of the most challenging shooters I've ever had the pleasure (although sometimes the pleasure turned into despair and anger) of playing in my whole life.\n\nIt took me my sweet time, several years, to finish it. But I finally beat the whole episode today. 18 maps of pure awesomeness. The last map is one of the best maps ever to be a final map in any game. I couldn't believe what I was seeing when I saw it.\n\nNow, this game is not for amateurs. If you beat the first Wolfenstein 3D game, and I mean all 6 episodes of it, in I'M DEATH INCARNATE, well, you're still gonna have quite the challenge when you play this one. Imagine the last map in episode 2, but 10x harder.\n\nAny true Wolfenstein fan knows about this game, but if you've never heard of it and loved Return to Castle Wolfenstein, Wolfenstein 3D and are excited about The New Order, well, you should give this one a spin. Might be the little retro experience you were looking for. And, of course, it will keep you in your seat while you wait for The New Order to come out.","April 12, 2014","true","19.4"," 74 of 77 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","74","77","2","0"

A sequel to what is probably my favorite game of all time, Wolfenstein 3D.\n\nThe settings they chose for DOSBox don't appeal to me however. I am not keen on using filtered graphics. I like crisp pixels. If you would like to see what I mean there, is an easy way to set the graphics very crisp and original feeling, and while we are at it, we can also smooth out animation a lot:\n\n1. Right-Click the game in Steam, and choose "Properties".\n2. Click on the "Local Files" tab.\n3. Click "Browse Local Files".\n4. Double click the "base" directory.\n5. Open "SOD.conf" with notepad.\n6. Look for the "[sdl]" section.\n7. Change "output=ddraw" to "output=overlay".\n8. Scroll down to "[cpu]" section.\n9. Change "cycles=auto" to "cycles=12000".\n\nSave and exit notepad.\nRun the game and enjoy.\n\nThis smooths out animation greatly, and provides original crisp feeling graphics. Some people prefer the filtered look, if that's you, just leave it as ddraw and only change the "cycles" option.","February 23, 2014","true","0.4"," 54 of 54 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","54","54","2","1"

Yes, this is a lot like Wolf3d but that's not really a bad thing. The levels seem a little more open and the bosses seem a little more difficult. Actually, the game in a whole is a lot more difficult than Wolf3d. And while it doesn't have MechaHitler (who happens to be one of my favorite video game bosses of all time) the end level is quite awesome both pre and post obtaining the spear. A must play for anyone who enjoyed Wolf3d.. I actually think I liked it more.","May 22, 2014","true","4.3"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","17","18","0","0"

As a bonus, Missions 2 & 3 (Return to Danger and Ultimate Challenge) are included free of charge.

It also has a really cool ending that reminded me of DOOM! Plus you get 2 mission packs for Spear of Destiny, but I didn't really like them. Some of the mission pack levels force you to find secrets to continue, have fun smashing your face in the wall. The mission packs do add different textures that make the game look and sound completely different, for better or worse. But the bosses in the mission packs are the same from the main game, and the ending is the same too, but it does actually have DOOM references. I did really enjoy playing the main missions, just not the mission packs. I would recommend Spear of Destiny to any Wolf3D fan.\n9/10\n(P.S.

The Spear of Destiny is said to be the lance of Versailles which was touched by Jesus, those who harness it are said to become immortal. The Wermarcht seek it out as B.J sets out to kill them before they steal it.\n\nGameplay\nYour standard fare of Nazi-killin', secret spotting and meal gobbling franticness. Same as Wolfenstein 3D but with far more variety in map design and secret layouts also spots some of the most fanciest level design I have seen for a game of its age, Hallways are decroated with the skeletons of the dead, crumbling caverns with foliage and cathedrals with stained glass and portraitures of Hitler's ugly mug.\n\nGunplay\nHandles the same as Wolfenstein 3D. You are locked to the X axis and cannot aim up or down (unless you use a different source port than the one given!) and you have to use your mouse keys or a mouse.\n\nGraphics\nTextures are more contrasting and pleasing to the eyes, patterns on walls don't look as bad (not as blocky as before). The immersion factor impresses me because of their creative use of 2D sprites giving the room a stylistic flare and the thematic style is consistent and believable.\n\nMechanics\nThe mechanics are very simple in Wolfenstein, you simply aim left or right aligning your shot to the enemy on screen and hit LMB (Left Mouse Button) to fire at him. Once he goes down he may drop ammo. Pressing Space on screen interacts with the environment and can unlock secrets. Progress through to the room with a switch 'Exit' to finish the level and to move on! Easy peazy.\n\nStory\nStop Hitler and the Nazi's from gaining the powers held in the Holy Lance stolen from Versailles which will grant him UNLIMITED POWER!\n\nCriticisms; Minor\nUse of DOSBOX. Very limited features, Google ECWOLF and install it to have better sound and graphics!","March 30, 2014","true","0.4"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/9000/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","Spear of Destiny is a sequel to Wolfenstein 3D. A very close one. So close, that you could as well call it a stand-alone expansion pack. In nutshell, it only has new levels and new bosses, otherwise you are getting same Wolfenstein 3D experience. Steam also comes with two "lost episodes" or "mission packs". They weren't made by id software themselves, and are kinda... feel like unofficial mods that Publisher made official. So yes, the package of Spear of Destiny on Steam is quite complete.\n\nSteam version of Spear of Destiny is quite true to original. Almost nothing was changed. Aside from in-game "Apogee" being changed into "Activision', even though by now it's outdated and should be "Bethesda", but no one cares anymore. It also completely removed help section out of game, most likely due to outdated ordering info. So no intro story to be found there.\nIt uses DosBox to make games run on modern PCs. And as usual, the configuration of DosBox is the one that will make the game lag heavily. But it's fixed easily. Just go to game's folder and edit conf file of game for DosBox to use OpenGl rendered. It will fix lags and allow you to make screens with Steam Overlay too.\n\nWhen you launch the game, you are allowed to choose between original Spear and two mission pack. One should note that they all use same save slots. Yes, you can even load saves from another pack, and it kinda works, landing you in current's pack level in saved spot! Didn't check futher though.\n\nSpear of Destiny is a pretty simple expansion pack. It doesn't add new enemies. It doesn't add new weapons. It's same old things as Wolfenstein 3D, even if still decently done. Instead, what it has is around 20 new levels, divided into 4 generic themes, like yellow dungeon and blue corridors of blue bricks in prison part. All while staying in a single castle, working floor after floor up, to the top, where Spear of Destiny is kept, that you must to retrive from hands of Nazis, storyline being prequel to Wolfenstein 3D.\nAt the end of each set of levels of single theme, that is around 4-5 levels per theme, you will face a boss, that are the only new enemies in this game. ...Which require absolutely same tactics of "pop out, shoot some before they shoot back, hide back, go to secret cache of supplies if things go bad", so they are still lame. And sure thing there are new decorative objects here and there, as well as new textures here and there. It also added a bunch of new music, some of which is actually quite great, "Evil Incarnate" is quite memoriable track, played on the final.\nThe only memoriable, new experience got to be the final. After defeating the boss on pre-last level, you will get a key to the room with spear inside it. Once you pick it up, you will hear a short fanfare that felt like it was interrupted at the end. Yet the game doesn't end here and you are free to move. And once you open door and come out of the room, you found out that you was sneakily transported into next, last level, a Doom-styled hell, where you have to defeat THE final boss.\nOh. And it also has a proper ending, with music, credits and nice artwork, like a proper videogame. Much better than usual id software's text "oh, you won. You are the best. Wow. You married president's girl. You are such baddass!!"\n\nThe 20 levels does provide a much more packed experience than dragged out Wolfenstein 3D with 6 episodes, so it's not so all that dull and may be more fun. But it doesn't have Hitler to kill, and the core gameplay is still aged, with hitscan enemies everywhere, making you use cover tactics and "spam first", so...\n\nAnd then there are two additional mission packs. Those were made by different people, who tried to also mod the game and make it feel more different. But the only thing you could change in Wolf3D before Source Code release were sprites, sounds, textures and layouts of levels. So yes, nothing new, it just got a whole new skin. A blue-green one. And feels like a cartoon, a lot, which is kinda both feels good and bad.\nIt also has new bosses and a new bat enemy... Nah. Just kidding. Those are reskins.\n\nAnd then there are levels themselves... They weren't designed all that good. Most often, it's designed to be as complex as possible. Mission pack 2 has either the levels that will abuse your brain and are chore to beat or the ones that can be quickly skipped through. Mission pack 3 is more of the middle between those two, being a bit better designed. New textures help to set more interesting themes to it, like submarine and research labolatories, so at least this is good and brings more variety. Until you get to explore the maze where the only wall texture is a blue cave one. Repeated over and over. Such joy.\nAnd yes, they want levels to be so complex, that in these mission packs finding secret pushwalls is mandatory to beat the level. Get ready to hump every wall. I must say, that the first theme in Mission pack 2 was cleverly designed around this and I liked it, but I felt I needed to take a good break of simple action, but it just kept on frying up my brain with mazes, so whole experience is the one to avoid. There is a good protip: secret pushwalls are marked by having unique object placed nearby.\nMemoriable positive experience? Final level of Mission Pack 3, where it sends into future. With UAC crates placed around.\n\nSo yes. Mission Packs 2 and 3 should be avoided by casuals. Only for fans who want their complex tiring mazes.\n\nOriginal campaign is still not bad, but as said... core gameplay remains same as Wolf3D. It didn't age.","February 19, 2015","false","30.8"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","43","6","14","2","1"

During WWII, the american spy B. J. Blazkowitz is after the Spear of Destiny, stolen by the nazis. You have to run through 21 levels and various bosses. Simple as that. What else can I say? It's a damn old game, running on dosbox, so a little knowledge of old systems and dosbox might help to tune it a little to prevent annoying little details, but at least it's working fine.\nI still DO NOT recommend to buy the game. Why? Because there's a free online version in the official wolfenstein site where you can play the first three episodes directly through your browser... And if you look deeper in a search engine you can find another site with all 6 episodes AND the spear of destiny expansion. It looks even more polished and plays smooth as silk, So why buying? -.-\n\n+++PROs+++ GAMEPLAY. There's not much to say, as one of the first FPS it's quite simple to understand how it works. There are still hidden walls, secret levels and of course nazi soldiers with impossible coloured suits... XD\nADDED MISSIONS. Although I didn't advice to buy this edition on steam I have to point out that there are 2 added mission packs called "Return to Danger" and "Ultimate Challenge". They can be a good reason to consider buying this release.---CONs--- DOSBOX. It's true, it's the only way to play it on modern PCs, but still as it is it's hard to play smooth. You have to know it a little to tweak the emulator performance to bring it to a good state of playability (CTRL+F11 or F12 to increase/decrease the CPU Cycle). For some odd reason seems like this is the only dosbox game I tried until now that crashes on launch for appearently no reason (Because it's the only one and happens only when I launch from steam, while if I launch directly the bat file inside the steamapps directory it works like a charm). Luckily it was enough to set compatibility on win XP SP3 for dosbox's exe.\nFREE. This game is almost 25 years old and still isn't in abandonware state but, even if it can't be considered quite "legit", you can play it online in your web browser for free. really. Even the original 6 episodes. So why buying?","February 11","false","0.2"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","38","3","8","2","0"

The problem is that Wolf3D was already a game with a thriving modding and mapping community. You could already find tons of new maps, weapons and enemies, all free of charge, if you wanted more from your Wolf3D experience.\n\nToday there is very little point in purchasing this.

In the early 90s, consoles were well into their formative years, while PC gaming had just begun to crawl really, when a smaller software company known as id released a quasi-3d Nazi killing game that was essentially a bunch of flat textures in a structure that offered the illusion of 3D.

The gameplay is a barebones breakdown of everything current shooters are -- you walk around an environment looking for things to shoot, you shoot them before they shoot back, you find the way to the next area.  All in all, the game is surprisingly simple in comparison to games available today, the difference between the three guns primarily being the rate at which they spit out bullets, and the lack of auto aiming and realistic bullet physics means shooting a nazi in the elbow from half a post code away is as effective as a point blank center mass shot, but the game is still exceedingly fun.  the repetitive wall and floor textures hearken back to my childhood gaming years, and the sound of yelling nazis as they are shot never really gets old.  Though the game itself is comparatively short and simple in comparison to newer games, that's really okay, as this is better played in shorter stints, enjoyed as a brief trip down nostalgia lane.  Not entirely sure if it's worth five dollars of nostalgia, but it’s certainly worth something.\n\nGame’s Fate: Its 13 megs, and a fun little time waster.

Though the game itself is comparatively short and simple in comparison to newer games, that's really okay, as this is better played in shorter stints, enjoyed as a brief trip down nostalgia lane.  Not entirely sure if it's worth five dollars of nostalgia, but it’s certainly worth something.\n\nGame’s Fate: Its 13 megs, and a fun little time waster.  Kept\nBuy/No Buy: I wouldn’t necessarily buy it at full price, but it goes on sale occasionally.  Definitely get it then.\n\n","February 10","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

By the time I reached level 12, mutants were around every corner with their instant inhuman reactions (Reminds of of the jackal snipers in Halo 2 on legendary). Most of Spear's levels are hard to navigate due to there being more hallway mazes than rooms which leads to 1-2 shot deaths in milliseconds, no matter your reation time with a fast monitor/tv or a wired mouse/keyboard/controller. I would still recommend this game  for easier difficulties or if you enjoy classic games.","March 28","true","16.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
