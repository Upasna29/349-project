Also there is just too much Chakra in this game with all these chars being brought back to life, it causes my game to crash frequently.  I also verified game cache multiple times still the game crashes.\n\nSo after 14.4 hours invested into the game and unlocking every character\nHere is my analysis.\n\nPro's\n- Ninja Escapades was well made and no pointless running from place to place. ( This was the main story for me not the Mecha-Naruto garbage.)\n\n- Improved UI\n\n-Class types\n-Ultimate jutus allows use of your ultimate jutsu (which varies depending which support chars you chose)\n\n-Awakening allows for true awakening, Magnekyou kakashi, Sage Mode Jiraiya, Kyuubi Mode Minato, Control over the 9 tails with Naruto, control the 10 tails with Obito, Susanoo's for those with Sharingan and much more.\n\n-Drive mode Allows chars to seal 2 substitution jutsu gauge slots and their opponents Ultimate jutsu in battle. Also starts you off with full support drive ready to be activated from the start of the fight.\n\n-Battle arena 1v1v1v1\n\n-Chakra Rails in free for all are a nice touch. They allow you to ride around the arena using jutsu or shoot you into the air to come crashing down on opponents (each move varying per char)\n\n- The timeline is well into Naruto and everyone is super powerful.\n\n- The jutsu's are well created and aesthetically pleasing.\n\n-Cons\n- The main story line is based around Mecha-Naruto\n\n- They Removed the forward combo from all chars leaving them with only 3 combos a tilt and a throw.\n\n-Game crashes (some of them carry over from Full burst)\n(This is a problem with my system.)\n\n-Shisui Regular B combo finisher = game crash\n-Hashirama (First Hokage) Normal punch = game crash\n-Minato (Fourth Hokage) true awakening = game crash\n-Shikamaru Ultimate Jutsu = game crash (which is actually a problem that I also had with Naruto Storm Full Burst 3.5)\nI will post more as I find them.\n\n- Annoying obstacle chars ruin the immersion of a free for all ninja battle.\n\n- Free for all ninja battle in the story mode sometimes feels like a 1v3\n\n- lack of player control for 1v1v1v1's,\n(What needs to be implemented)\n1) Allow players to set up free for alls and control options in free battle tab.\nA) Allow 2v2's and 1v2's or even 1v3's.\nB) Implement player free for alls\nC) Allow toggle for obstacle chars/rails/traps/barrier for the arena\n\n- Needs more combos for True awakening chars (Kurama only has 1 combo and ten tails only has an arm smash and arm sweep.)\n\n- No Juubito\n\n11/10 because I love the characters of Naruto and being able to fight with them (especially with the new Team Ultimate Jutsu system) does make it worth it for me.\n\nBut\n\n6/10 as a fighting game. Maybe.\n\n\nSomeone came to me to ask about the controller mechanics. Having a controller absolutely does make this game easier to play, but is not necessary. I adapted to Naruto storm full burst pretty easily without the controller and only use the controller because my girlfriend bought one to use when she plays. But in my honest opinion Controller > Keyboard for this game.\n\n\nShout out to Hiradragon She (or he) makes a very valid point with this comment. I still prefer games like street fighter though.\n\nHiradragon - (かがみ) Oct 21 @ 12:37pm  Delete\nThey have added a lot of subtle changes to make it more competitive (such as counters, dodge changes, combo cancels and more drive types). Sure the combos don't require you to memorise anything, but it is definitely a more skill based game than previous titles.","September 18, 2014","true","18.7"," 211 of 259 people (81%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","81","211","259","5","25"

Take this only for the multiplayer, since the story mode is boring as hell. Like every game of Naruto, its story mode is too easy, and even if set on super hard it will still look easy.\nMultiplayer mode, imo, is where this game shines.\nOne particulary critic I will make however is regarding how the game was made. Almost all character models were taken from the previous Naruto games. there is no difference! one can only distinguish this from the other one on steam simply because here you can choose between true awakening, ultimate justu, but beside that there is nothing new. Sure, there are also new character, but I don't think that is enough to make the price go to 49,99€. I own both game and there is no change in attack animation, no change in the voice, and they even kept the same subtitles with the SAME grammar - and not only- mistakes !  (in the italian version 4 mizukage makes a grammar mistake and the Raikage, even if he says "that's the power of the raikage, in the italian subtitles it says "that's the power of the hokage")  The same kind of errors appeared in both this and the other game, they didn't even bother to check them or to make something new. On internet is already possible to see how the next game will be, and again I already recognised moves already seen. I give him a positive vote but, as a fun of the series, I'm quite disappointed","February 20, 2015","true","334.0"," 148 of 175 people (85%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","85","148","175","20","11"

It is a fanservice, a way to spend time in an enjoyable way, not something that will cause catharsis. Is it good? Depends on how you look at it. As a fighting game, it's superior in every way for their predecessors. Still, there had to be a downside when compared to the old games: it has no storyline. Thing is, the game doesn't need one. I played it 100% to be sure of that. It has a lot of characters and even more sidequests.\nThere's a whole island to free roam, new areas get accesible as you progress in the tournaments, areas where you can find characters, do what they request to unlock them. On the island you can also exchange medals to get accesories and you can try your luck at the lottery. The tournament mode is a lot of fun, it's well designed and the challange clearly goes higher as you go near the end of the path, the spot where your chosen ninja is acclaimed as being the greatest of them all. Best part is, it doesn't get repetitive. There are obstacles, enemy power ups, all kinds of things to keep you pumped.\nThere's also a short story involving an abandoned concept, the mecha-naruto, a story which has some humour, some moral talking(you have to look deep) and an emotional end. It can also be considered as a NaruHina fanservice.\nOne feature that should be noted is the Team Ultimate Jutsu, which actually makes the "who's on your team) matter, as the strong combo involves the compatible characters do awesome stuff together.\n30 FPS lock kills the mood for the regular PCGamer, but you won't notice it, as it keeps steady and the actions are fast, flashy and quite spectacular. You can enjoy the combat by choosing what type of extra power your chosen characters will have, the league mode, another tournament mode and the survival mode, where some great challanges awaits.\nFor the online part I'll say: same old, same old. I have to keep my finger crossed to get a lag free match. Good thing is, achievment hunters don't need to bother with it.\nAs for the DLC, all are skin packs, the story is safe and tucked away for the next game.\nThis is the first game I pre-ordered and I don't have any reason to regret it.\nThe predecessor had a moving story. This one got everything else better, that's why I enjoyed it a lot more.\nIt has a lot of content and most of it is great, this game delivered on it's promises. While many say it could be better in some aspects, as someone who played all the game has to offer, I don't give a f**k. A storyline would have made it shine brighter than Naruto in Beast Mode, but I guess they're keeping the best for last(next game just has to be that awesome)\nThis game is a 9.4.","October 5, 2014","true","47.4"," 83 of 106 people (78%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","78","83","106","5","2"

However, if you don't own a gamepad or XBOX 360 Controller, this game is nigh impossible to play. It took me almost an hour to beat the 3rd battle in story mode, simply because the Keyboard controls are so convoluted and hard to use. That being said, this game assumes you have an XBOX 360 controller plugged in, so all the movement instructions are in the format of ABXY commands (Which, on a Keyboard, are bound to L;PO by default). Good luck trying to figure out where the RT and LT buttons are. It took a lot of getting used to to play this properly, and the controls cause my hands to become quite cramped after a relatively short gaming session (about 30 minutes).\nThe game itself, graphics, story, voice acting, characters and whatnot, are excellent, the models are well made and the attack animations are great. There are characters that are clearly overpowered, such as Bijuu mode Naruto and Deidara, as well as those that are severely underpowered, like Konan, but that's to be expected in a game set in the Naruto Universe.\n\nAll in all I'd give this game a 7/10, if you're playing with a keyboard.\nIf you have a controller or a gamepad, I'd give it an 8.5/10.","May 20, 2015","true","32.9"," 49 of 62 people (79%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","79","49","62","10","8"

The objective is to collect as many "balls" as possible while going ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on Sakura. The first difficulties are one sided slaughters in which you decimate your opponents like new born babies with a 10000-0-0-0 score and tell yourself "bg, 2 ez, l2p noobs" after the match.\n\nThe story, which is the true gem of the Naruto games, is pretty non-existent.\nThere's only approximately 1 hour of story gameplay.\nThe story mode is entitled "The Ninja Escapades" which consist of 3 different chapters.\nThe Creation of Akatsuki, which tells us how they gathered their members etc.\nThe Fall of the Uchiha Clan, which tells us how Shisui and Itachi tried to stop the coup d'état.\nThe Far Reaches of Hope, which is a movie of Team Minato featuring Kushina.\nThe Ninja Escapades give an amazing animelike experience, which you can just watch on youtube if you're only in for the story.\nAs I bought the game I didn't really know what to expect, the anime isn't that far from where Fullburst left us so there couldn't possibly be +10 hours of story gameplay incoming, still I hoped there'd be more to the story.\n\nThe fighting system is pretty much like Fullburst with a couple new mechanics added, Guard Break and Counterattack.\nGuard Break is an attack that "breaks" the guard of his opponent, a stroke is executed by holding the opponent and knocking him down and leaving him unconscious for a moment, taking a break for the player to carry out a coup that further damage the opponent.\nCounterattack is used when an opponent is about to land an attack on the player, the players can knock them unconscious, rendering them helpless and sealing their support.\n\nAs the game seems to be focused mostly on the Ninja Tournament, it really ruins it for me. I play the games for the story and not overall whacking and dominating my opponents to the oblivion. But as a fan of the series I have a hard time not recommending this game, but I do recommend you wait for a Steam Sale, as this game is definitely not worth 49,99€.\nIf you're having difficulties choosing between this and Fullburst, don't fret over it.\nBuy Fullburst for the sake of the story.","September 17, 2014","true","3.4"," 56 of 75 people (75%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","75","56","75","7","2"

And i wouldn't want it any different.\n\nTo some this might seem to be an unwise decision. However, I bet that the developers thought of the same thing i did before the game's release: if they put the story that spans from Storm 3's ending to the present animated episode (and more precise, The Ten-Tails Jinchuriki) then for the next game (Storm 4 maybe?) there wouldn't be any plot left (and i have taken into consideration the manga). Moreover, it's not the first time a Naruto game has it's own story that is not connected to the anime. It's just like a filler that is present in the anime, but not in the manga, only we are talking about a game.\n\nWith that being said, it's time to dwelve into the said game. An improvement is sure to be noticed from the previous game. While it runs the same engine (and you might observe that the whole menu works the same), the game's graphics  look stunning as always.\n\nThe main story is more quest-oriented, with open-world exploration and that is exactly what we needed: a relaxing game that is simply the bridge between Storm 3 and the next Storm game. And when i say relaxing i mean that there is no actual plot development, as the battles are even more intense than ever. You have to participate in a tournament, that gets more and more difficult with every rank you pass. Outside of the tournament, you can make quests to get people in your team, play through arena challenges or do jobs. What more do you want than offering a flower to Lord Orochimaru just so he can join your team in the tournament?\n\nOutside the tournament you can play the Mecha-Naruto story (something teased in the last episode of Naruto Shippuden) or the Ninja Escapades. Those are never-before-told stories, that are long like an episode of the anime and let you do the battles.\n\nThe battle mechanics have also changed and take more of a strategic theme. You can now choose between Ultimate Jutsu, Awakening and Support Type. When you fill a special bar you can do something different depending on the Type you chose. Ultimate Jutsu does a stronger Ultimate jutsu that take double damage than normal. Awakening disables the Ultimate Jutsu but let's you use Awakening Mode. Finally, Support  makes use of your teammates and you can do a Sealing Jutsu that temporarily disables Chakra, Substitution etc. Depending on what you enemy uses, you can think tactically and choose what Type best suits the battle. I normally have doubt between Ultimate and Awakening since those 2 are pretty epic and i miss being able to use both.\n\nOn the downside, the game has a problem for attempting full 3D exploration(remember those camera angles in Storm 3? they're gone) and that is rendering distance. NPCs spawn a little late and you can be right near them and not see them.\n\nAll in all, the game is surely a lot multiplayer-oriented, having the biggest character roster.  Also, during the tournament you can see something Dark Souls-like. People can "ïnvade" your world through Network Clones. You can fight them or leave them there as they do not move. You can even send your own clone and have it level up. I haven't tried the network mode yet so i don't know if the connectivity problems are solved (though i didn't encounter any in Storm 3 Multiplayer, i am aware they existed), but as far as i've read, this mode works better.\n\nIn conclusion, if you are a hard fan of Naruto, this is a game for you(though i would make it cheaper if i were Namco). The lack of anime plot is not a disadvantage, rather a marketing tactic, and one with which i am content as i won't cry over the lack of longer story in the sequel.\n\nOne last thing would be a big question mark, as i have played only 5 hours and have not finished even B-rank in tournament mode: if the game lacks anime plot, what is with the Ten-Tails picture on the Store Page? It might be something you unlock or possibly an Awakening (haven't tried Obito yet to see if it's true), or even a false advertising. However, this is something i will find out in the future. For now, all i can say is that this game is a must for Naruto fans.\n\nMUST TRY: Use Danzo Awakening Type and get him into True Awakening mode. Then you can do Sealing Tetragram Jutsu and if you hit the oponent well...i won't spoil the fun :)","September 17, 2014","true","34.8"," 89 of 135 people (66%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","66","89","135","2","15"

Still, the versus mode was what I was waiting for - and turned out to be a huge disappointment. I have spent hours and hours on NS:UNS 3 with my friends, and we were quite excited to play with the promising new game modes -  mean: true awakening, super support drive and combo ultimate jutsu: how could we not be pumped up?\n\nThe problem is, when you select one of these mods (and you are obligated to do so, there is no way around, no mod, nothing), the game locks ANY element of gameplay related to the other mods.\nWhich means : you cannot use your BASIC support style or enjoy your BASIC awakening if you want to have a Combo super jutsu ; you cannot use the BASIC super jutsu and BASIC awakening if you get the better support style, etc.\n\nIn the end, half of the old versus gameplay has been cut out of the game, preventing you from using the wide range of possibilities the previous game offered you. There is no classic mode : if you want to battle, you will have to do so without 2 core elements of your gameplay. And this drawback really ruined the game for me, as it really, really limits the choices you can make when in fight, going from a enjoyable and rich decision-making game to a deppressing "kite, vaguely land your combos and wait for your stong move" kind of game. The two new moves (counter attack and guard break attack) do not create enough variety on their own, in my opinion.\n\nTL;DR: If you come for the story, you may be disappointed; if you come for the gameplay and this awesome feeling of epic versus battle with a lot of gameplay possibilities, then by all means, stick to Naruto Shippuden Ultimate Ninja Storm 3. They failed the revamping of the fight system in NSUNS:Revolution, and there is no valid explanation for this.","August 24, 2015","false","4.6"," 78 of 120 people (65%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","65","78","120","13","6"

The story mode is a joke first of all. The Akatsuki Origins is interesting and takes about an hour. The Two Uchiha is also nice to see but was covered almost in its entirety by that Kakashi filler a while back adding in only a handful of new scenes and taking perhaps half an hour. The last one is a ten minute cutscene with zero gameplay and while it's still nice, I'm sure I don't need to explain why that's stupid. Then there's the one to two hour Mecha Naruto campaign that no one cares about. So yeah. The story clocks in then at less than four hours. No Tournament mode doesn't count because that's the same bloody fight with vaguely increasing levels of difficulty ad nauseum. I'd be disappointed if most indie games only lasted four hours much less a full priced game.\n\nAs for the Tournament mode by its own benefits though, it's fun enough and changes up the gameplay a bit. But again the gibbon left his grubby fingerprints all over everything and added a bunch of moronic special conditions. My favourite of which is when enemy attacks "seal" you. That is; you can't use Chakra for a time. No one apparently explained to the developer that Chakra is an essential part of the game. So your only recourse at this point is to stand around like a lemon with your thumb up your ♥♥♥♥. And this even applies to the free, long range and very hard to see coming and thus avoid Shuriken attacks. That three other characters whose AI only seems to target you can all throw. So you're basically guaranteed to spend that entire time wallowing in utter pointlessness. As well as plenty of other poor design choices and execution.\n\nThis game isn't worth £40/$50. It's that simple. I'm not even sure it'd be worth £20. It's barely a move on from Storm 3 Full Burst and while it's still fun most of the time, it's the most irritating game in the series so far. Especially with the amount of on-disk DLC people have already found showing how far CC2 realy have fallen into expoitative, nickle and diming ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Get this if you haven't got 3, but even then I'd say wait for news of a Storm 4. Which is a shame because there's a lot to like in this game too, hence why I still give it a recommendation. But there's so many little asterisks next to that recommendation and my anger isn't really with the game for the most part but at the developers and probably more so, the publishers who need to take a good hard look at themselves in the mirror. Which again is a shame because the developers at least seem like nice guys in interviews.\n\nOriginal review: I recommend buying this if you have more money than patience and you just can't wait to play as Sage Hashirama, Kyuubey Chakra Mode Minato, etc. or of course you don't own any of the other games. Otherwise, it is still only Storm 3.5 (or 3.75 if Full Burst was 3.5) - an improvement in many areas such as reworkings of old characters and quite a few new things but not really £40 worth of new and improved and as such I'd suggest waiting for a full on Storm 4 or at least a Revolution Full Burst type of deal. Having been with the game series from the start, this one feels more like it's a compromise between the first game and the later ones which is a good thing. Combining the refinery of the combat system and the depth with more elaborate combos and ultimates from the first game.\n\nIn short, it's a good game but it's largely the same good game that is has been since Storm 2.","September 15, 2014","true","79.0"," 122 of 199 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","122","199","0","0"

I will hereby explain why:\n\n\nThe game promised the, I quote, "Story of the Akatsuki", which was basically 5 minutes of  Obito telling Nagato and Konan which members to get for akatsuki , with a few fights featuring the respecitve characters thrown in. That's it. I would have expected to see some more insight inside Akatsuki, for example telling how  Obito gave Nagato the rinnegan thus leading to the akatsuki or some background story of their respective members.\n\nThe second "story" part of the game featured Shisui's Story, called "The Two Uchiha" (if it's not the correct title, you have the permission to shut up). This is basically the same as I wrote above: 2 fights, 5 minutes of anime, end.\n\nThe third story part contained no fights at all and was the most disappointing. 7-8 minutes of anime featuring Minato, Kushina, Obito, Rin and Kakashi talking to each other in a familiar manner (by familiar I mean the literal family). End, get achievement for watching an ova. Yay.\n\nAside from the gameplay changes (which annoy me to the fullest, who would want 3 different types of playable character?! Storm 3 Full Burst was just fine!) I have nothing more to say. It's the same old launcher, the same old settings you can choose, damnit, it's basically the same game with community mods! Nothing spectacular happened in the time from Storm 3 Full Burst and Revolution, and still they want the same damn amount of money as last time! I call literal bs on this game, I deeply regret buying this game and If I could, I would refund it and get something more advanced. I understand that the developers wouldn't change something that works, but charging the same prize for basically the same game twice is completely unjustified.\n\n\nEDIT (20.12.2014): If I should rate this game it would be 9/11. Never again.","September 16, 2014","false","5.5"," 35 of 52 people (67%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","67","35","52","5","0"

It’s fairly enjoyable but I only played through it once to be honest.\nJust like the previous one, the graphics look fantastic and faithfully translates Naruto’s world into a game. The options are little limited though. You can chose resolution, V-Sync, Super sampling and window/fullscreen. I think at this point I should note, the game is locked at 30fps, which isn’t a big deal, the animations are extremely fluid regardless.\nIn terms of gameplay I find this one to be the best, they’ve included a few new mechanics like counter and guard break pill, and you can chose from 3 different battle types: Ultimate Jutsu Type, Drive Type and Awakening Type. It’s an attempt to balance the game but Drive type seems to be the best from all 3.\nThere are new 4 player(You and 3 AI) battles that you can enjoy in the Ninja World Tournament, which get boring fast, due to the easy AI. It’s a shame that this can’t actually be played with 4 players.\nOther than that there is huge amount of content from a huge rooster of characters., customization items for your characters, cards, titles.\n\nIf you are a Naruto fan, this is a must buy, plenty of fan service and fun to be found.\n","November 16, 2014","true","97.1"," 23 of 32 people (72%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","72","23","32","4","0"

Compared to Storm 3, the games predecessor, it pales in in comparison. The "story mode" known as ninja escapades is half ♥♥♥♥♥ at best, with only 3 scenarios to play through that don't outline anything new. I usually play the Naruto games to catch with the anime I don't feel like watching so when I played and discovered the lack of any story and the skip from 3 to basically the end of Shippuden I was unhappy to say the least. THe new 'Ninja World Tournament' mode is also half ♥♥♥♥♥. While the mode is fun, towards the end they throw so much stuff into the little arena provided that I have almost no idea what's going on! It takes about 4 hours to beat this mode and there's real variation in gameplay throughtout with the same Battle format being thrown at you to the point where it seems like a repetitive grind. Speaking of repetitive, the cutscenes and commentary would also have the same descriptor attached to it, where as you move up the ranks of the tournament there is literally no variation in cutscenes or the 5 lines of "Commentary" (which does not even apply to the battle mind you). The Mecha Naruto story is even somehow WORSE! Have you done mushrooms while taking a ♥♥♥♥ ton of adderrall? Because I felt like one of the producers did this and ranted to his father to implement this piece of garbage into the game for 5 hours until his will finally gave and put this horrid  content into the Naruto game! The story and gameplay is similar to that of previous Naruto games which is nice, a lot of running around just for a cutscene here or a battle there while providing some means to make me care... Up until half way through when I realize just non-sensical and stupid this is!  The story for it makes Zero sense and is vague as hell behind the backstory and how Mecha Narutop even works!

But the thing is it's story is really poor. Mecha Naruto story would be a good extra content but it one of the main stories of this game and  it's awful. Ninja Escapes mode lets you to play some major things that happened in anime but it isn't enough for a game like this. Ninja Wold Tournament is something pretty but just like I said it can't be more than an extra content. I actually recommend this game but only if you are a fan of Ultimate Ninja Storm series.","August 29, 2015","true","18.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

They added a lot more compared to Storm 3.\n+ Better graphics.\n+ 3 playable "little" storys, cutscenes are from anime and in 2 of them you actually get to fight, but not like boss battles. In third you just watch.\n\nNeutral:\n~ Tournament, Is really boring, But someone might find it entertaining.\n~ Mecha-Naruto story mode, Is really boring, but as I said about tournament, Someone might find it interesting.\n\nCons:\n- A lot of characters aren't updated since Storm 2.\n- We have 3 types of gameplay for each character, Ultimate Jutsu, Awakened and Drive type, Which I hate.\n- Only few new stages added.\n- Online still has a lot of problems\n- Few characters are too overpowered (Tenten, Shino, Temari, Deidara and ect.)\n- Spamming Counters.\n- There isn't any storyline.\n\nI recommend this game only for Naruto fans.\nI give 8/10","April 30","true","46.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

"Adventure mode". Almost identical mode from Storm 3 and older titles where you complete various requests and run around the map (an island in this case) just with some tweaks like 4 man battle royal (which sadly wasn't implemented online). Adventure mode was fun for just like half an hour.\n2. "Ninja Escapades". Kinda like a 3 part anime OVA with some battles included. "The Far Reaches of Hope" - Team Minato story (no battles at all, pure animation); "The Two Uchiha" - Itachi and Shisui storyline; "The Creation of the Akatsuki" - a story about Akatsuki.. (duh). This mode was pretty awesome but it's short and the replayability of it is very low.\n3. And, of course, the mainstream freebattle with new mode called "League" which is kinda "meh" but there are no downsides for having this in the game.\n• Many optimization issues like random frame drops, high CPU usage in sessions and online battles which was the reason for some people not to play online at all (like me).\n• Cancerous online experience. Even though I couldn't play online, I know for a fact from watching tons of videos on Youtube or reading comments that online was literally a crap (unless you only play with friends). Many characters are unbalanced or broken, fighting types were completely unnecessary and the counter was the worst of them all. Also the tournament was ruined because the spectator thingy was removed.\n• Lack of graphic settings, bad keyboard support (Though it goes for every Storm game).\n• Removal of old EMS Sasuke, some older stages and a few ultimate jutsus. (I don't get the reason why?)\n\n\nPros:\n• Few more extra characters, some (not many) updates for older characters (mostly awakening actions). Also 3 new humongous awakenings, that, in my opinion, are sick! (Obito,Madara,Hashirama)\n• Character customization (secret factors/accessories/substitutions)\n• Smoother flow of battles (where's my 60 fps though?) ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)\n• Team combination ultimate jutsus.\n\nOverall, a solid 6.5/10 and a good reason not to get hyped a year before release.\n\nMy Storm 4 review\nMy Storm 3 review","March 16","false","152.1"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","9","13","2","0"

It's really really fun if you play with some friends locally with a couple of beers. It's easy to learn, looks flashy and you could develop your skills and get better if you wanted. However, the singleplayer part is poop. Mostly boring 4 character brawls over some orbs, it gets old really quick.\nWell aren't you glad that you can go online then? Nope, because the netcode is horrible and the PC port is terrible. Like say you play against someone who runs the game at 20 FPS while you have a steady 30, in any other game you'd have the advantage. But not here, you get lag and constant messages about waiting to connect during the fights. And when thats not happening the delay can be so bad your character wont react to your commands for a second.

From the "Story Mode" right down to the core combat mechanics this series has taken a turn for the worst. There's no actual story mode in this game, instead you are given a poorly put together arena mode where you fight to collect the opponents balls. In order to progress in this mode you are forced to tediously wonder around a miraculously bland open ended world.  If you were expecting the actual gameplay and combat to be as fast paced and intense as Full Burst then don't waste your time. Instead of utilizing the mechanics that worked last time they decided to adopt a very floaty combat system with the speed cut in half compared to UNS3.

I can only recommend this game.\n\nI'm playing on a laptop, and not a gaming one in fact. So for me to still be able to run this without problems is perfect. So some of you with old pieces of sh*t PC's can also enjoy a tournament I suppose. And as for bugs some report. I've seen none so far.\n\nNow let's get to the details. The mechanic is almost the same as in Full Burst. But the step forward is the 3 battle types you can choose from.\nUltimate jutsu - as for every charecter you can use the ultimate jutsu for pure power. But also with a full bar you can perform a team utlimate. Nothing special, it's all standard.\nTrue awekening - This is a great option. You can't use utlimate but you can become stronger in a pinch. If you play right you don't even have to go below 50% of your HP. This allows you to become stronger and use some hidden abbilities. For examples Hidan with true awekening can with LB create a circle and with RB you can spam to induce damage on your oponent without moving. And even if you move just reactivate a new field with L1 and viola. Death in spot. But ofcourse evry character has it's own true awekening with more power or different use.\nSupport Drive - This one.. I haven't tried much. I only know if you fill out the bar you can perform a FREAKING SEALING JUTSU. With that you instantly seal 2 substitution logs, half chakra, the power bar (for one of the 3 styles) and such. Really gives you advantage in a pinch if you know how to play strategy in a full head-on battle.\n\nCharacters are amazing, new ones bring interesting option.s Although unlocking them is hard as in tournament mode you have to go to them, complete their tasks and then you may play them. Some you win when you finish a tournament mode. Like 3rd Raikage on D tournament as a additional prize.\n\nI would surely recommend this game. It has potential to be time consuming.\n\n12/10 because 11/10 ain't enough.","September 21, 2014","true","23.2"," 13 of 21 people (62%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","62","13","21","2","0"

About NARUTO SUNSR: First of all, it has an nice Online-Multiplayer-Tournament Modus. Sure it cant reach such games like Street Fighter, but it is over the average. Graphics are impressive! and its respect for the source material is tremendous. The traditional model for this type of game is well established: developers choose a saga or story arc from the anime and creates a campaign around it, supplementing it with some extras and versus modes. Also an new attraction in the form of Ninja Escapades, a mode that has three small stories, intending to fill some gaps left by the anime or manga. This includes the origin of the Akatsuki group and all are filled with animated sequences, produced by the team that makes the television series. It's an interesting addition, which serves as exclusive episode of the series, with the difference that the fights take place with the game engine, and with the participation of the player.\n\nConclusion:  Positiv: Small original stories accompanied with Anime sequences. Tournament mode is fun. More than 100 characters. Perfect for fans of Naruto.\nNegativ: Does not follow the series storyline. It lacks a major campaign. Among so much characters, there are natural imbalances, but maybe some patches gonna fix that.\n\nIf you like such games and love Naruto. Grab it!

I pre-purchased Revolution (at least a month or two in advance) with the intention (especially because of the advertisements) to play a story mode that progresses from Storm 3....but NOPE. I wanna save anyone the trouble of buying this game please don't buy this if you are looking for a continuation to Storm 3 as you will not find it. Ninja Escapdes just has prequel stories (which one of them you don't even play in). The mecha naruto story was pretty boring, and the tournment mode gets really repititive after awhile. This was obviously a ploy because now I'm sure these storm games won't end untill like Storm 5...it's a shame but it is what it is. You would think they would continue you along (like what generations did) especially considering where the anime and manga (with the manga pretty much near it's end) currently are but obviously not. I'm not saying this is a bad game but their choice on not even attempting to put a story mode in is just lazy and anyone whose ok with this obviously has some problems. Don't try to make excuses for it because you ♥♥♥♥ ride the company this is unacceptable because Generations was a "Spin-off" and it had a story mode...so there's really no reason for this one not to have one.

Instead, we have Ninja World Tournament, Mecha-Naruto Story and the Ninja Escapades. The Ninja World Tournament is just mode, in which you thrive for championship in a tournament consistin of 4-characters brawl. Initial ranks of the tournament are easy, but difficulty rises gradually. Also, you can roam the island (the bigger progress you made in the tournament, the more areas you can visit), doing challenges, missions and events. Even thought it has absolutely nothing to do with canon storyline, the mode is quite fun to play, some friendship events are hilarius.\n\nMecha-Naruto story is mode, in which you learn the story of the most controversial element of this game: Mecha-Naruto character. Designed by Masashi Kishimoto himself, Mecha-Naruto is machine based on game's tiltular character. His story is rather short, but it explores topics and problems Naruto fans are pretty familiar with. The story has a potential, but the execution is lacking: it could be a much more emotional story.\n\nNinja Escapades consists of 3 mini-stories: The Creation of Akatsuki, The Two Uchiha and The Far Reaches of Hope, each has cutscenes made by original show's animators, Studio Pierrot. It's a pitty thought, that only two of these actually consist of gameplay. The stories are supposed to be surpervised by Masashi Kishimoto, but I don't believe that: at least two of these stories consists of logical errors. It was the most obvious in the Creation of Akatsuki: we haven't learned of how the leader managed to win against legendary Hanzo the Salamander; we didn't learn of who were the previous partners of Kakuzu, since he is state to be killing them; Sasori's former Akatsuki partner never saw his true form in the manga; Deidara and Orochimaru didn't belong to the group at the same time, much less Hidan and Orochimaru. I could go on.\n\nThe story isn't strong element of this title.\n\nThe game is 3D figthing-like game, based on Masashi Kishimoto's manga series. I said "3D fighting-like game" because it uses very simple game controls - you won't be fighting your controller constantly. Instead, you'll be making a very simple button combinations (like block + attack, block + shuriken, chakra + jump etc.) and the basic combos are combosed on just attack button and directional pad.\n\nThat is not to say that the game is boring and has no substance to it. The gameplay is very dynamic, there are also counterattack, guardbreak mechanics, alongside with throws, "tilt attacks", support characters, cancels and 3 team types. A few of those mechanics are new: counterattack is reflex-based mechanics that causes long guardbreak to your opponent, if he manages to fall for your couterattack attempt, while guardbreak pills are special attack that, if it hits, renders your opponent helpless for a certain period of time, but can be used only twice during the battle and can be easily interrupted.\n\nThe game has been rebalanced in comparison to the previous title. That is not to say, that game is perfectly balanced: some developer's decision (I don't mean mistakes) made me scratch my head. It is hower, step in the right direciton: weaker characters were tweaked, slower were speed up, awakening mechanics were rebalanced (no more priority via dashing), some top-tiers characters were nerfed, ultimate jutsus are not doing that much damage when canceled or used on guardbreak opponents, etc. One of the crucial things is separating awakening, ultimate jutsu and support drive into 3 team types, meaning that you can have only one of those things. Some players are saiyng it's dumbing down the game, but I think it's an attempt for rebalancing the gameplay, and it's a factor of choose how you want to play your character.\n\nGraphically, the game is OK. It's faithful to anime art style, and it's good. Music, on the other hand while decent is not very memorable. I can't recall any track from Mecha-Naruto stroy at all.\n\nI didn't have serious problems with online mode, but evidently many people experienced disconnections, crashes, transmition errors and so on. For the time being, it's the serious problems and the developers needs to do something about that, otherwise online mode will be dead. Speaking in online, ranked matches are very punishing if it comest to earning and losing battle points: it's hard to earn them (you have to fight someone of your rank in order to fight be worth your time), but it's very easy to lose them (losing against someone of your rank is as punishing, but lose against someone like 1-3 ranks lower than you and I guarantee you'll be frustrated). Results are, even with 65% winning ratio, you aren't achieving anything.\n\nDespite all of this, the gameplay feels nice and fun, especially when playing against living opponent. But I think that this game is mainly made for Naruto fans, and I highly recommend it to those people. Fans will be pleased to have about 100 characters to choose. On the other hand, fans of hardcore fighting games like Street Fighter or Tekken are going to be dissapointed.\n\nPROS:\n+Rebalanced, fun gameplay\n+Narutoverse (for fans)\n+Great for multiplayer\n+Over 100 characters to pick\n+New mechanics\n+Little harder than other Storm games\n\nCONS:\n+Online problems\n+Game balance is still flawed\n+Ocassional bugs\n+Optimalization could be better\n+Too simplistic to be likeable for hardcore fighting games fans\n+Dissapointing story modes\n\nOVERALL: 8/10","October 8, 2014","true","482.3"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","10","16","2","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Yogizilla/recommended/272510/","Yogizilla","Yogizilla - GeekyAntics!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Yogizilla/","337 products in account","As the Naruto series slowly comes to an end, I find myself saddened and desperately trying to find Naruto experiences that will help me relive the greatest moments from the manga and anime.  This is such a rich universe filled with loveable characters, epic battles, and awesome powers.  Utimate Ninja STORM Revolution brings the mythos and AWESOME to life at every step..  But there are opportunities.\n\nFirst, I will warn you that the console versions still seem to be the way to go but this port is the best I've played so far.  We're all hopeful Storm 4 will deliver across the board but this game is no consolation prize.  What I love about this game is that it strikes a great balance between action/adventure game and deep fighter.  The exploration and questing is as satisfying as pulling off 60+ combos, calling in support, or pulling off an amazing block/comeback.\n\nReplay value is a huge thing for me.  As a family man, I can't buy every game that comes out so, when I buy a game, it needs to provide tons of replay value and fun.  Revolution certainly fits the bill there.\n\nReally, I love everything about this game.  It looks beautiful and the PC frame rate issues seem to have been resolved.  There are only a few things that bug me.  They are not deal breakers but it's good to know they are there:\n\n1)  Loading Times - They feel too long for what the game is..  Sure, there is the open world component but loading between menus seems very archaic to me.  You may want to load this game onto your SSD, which I may very well do.  Mind you, my gaming rig is not a bleeding edge system but it is more powerful than the average PC so this should not be happening at all.\n\n2)  Button Assignments - While you can remap buttons fully and controller support is flawless, I still don't get the button mappings in this series.  I feel that wasting a button for charging chakra is silly but I suppose it makes sense with the mechanic of chakra-loaded attacks.  A dedicated shuriken button, however, is really goofy.. But no biggy.  I would just rather see a weak/medium/strong setup for more control over your combos and fighting style; that way, people can't write this off as a mere button masher.\n\n3)  Lock-On System - The 1v1 battles are still the best.  I love the concept of FFA/Battle Royale, but the lock-on system here still leaves something to be desired.  You click the analog stick to unlock and click again to lock on, but it's not always clear which target you will lock onto.  A simple fix would be to have the crosshair appear on your targets as you move your characters, then click to confirm the lock.  Easy.\n\nRegardless, this game is tons of fun and it makes me want to go back to the XBox 360 and even Gamecube games.  That's not because this game sucks but, rather, it's so good you want to explore and revisit all the Naruto games.  I hope they make proper ports of all the games from previous platforms but, more importantly, I hope they make them proper ports, deserving of the PC platform.\n\nAnyway, back to UNS Revolution...\n\nOne feature I absolutely LOVE is the Network Clone.  This is an avatar that battles online players while you are away from the game.  They pop up in other instances, collecting items and experience.  You can fully customize your Network Clone and Story/Ninja Tournament characters, which I love because this gives the unlockables even more value.\n\nUltimate Ninja Storm Revolution combines the best of breed technologies and game mechanics from games like Mystic Heroes, Dynasty Warriors, Dragon Ball-Z (the good ones, not Xenoverse), and Forza (i.e. driveatars).  Truly, this game is a treat.  If you're a fan, don't hesitate..  Though I will say it is better-suited at $40 or less, not $50.. At least on PC.\n\nWith regards to Ombre's review and similar write-ups, the Story/Campaign is not boring if you don't mind running around a bit and reading lots.  There is quite a bit of dialogue and not that much voice acting, which isn't a bad thing but it does make me feel that this is a licensed game that should have released at a more appealing price point since they did cut a few corners.\n\nWhen you choose your "move type", you have to choose between Awakening (buffed character), Support Drive (buffed defense/attack support moves), or Ultimate Justu (unlocks OP ultimate).  I think this is actually a selling point for more casual players or folks like me, who can't dedicate as much time to gaming and certainly not one game in particular, no matter how much we love said game.  If you were able to have Awakening and Support Drive together, for instance, it'd be pretty OP..  And it would widen the gap between newer players and dedicated/hardcore vets.  That would make the experience too exclusive and essentially render the online gameplay useless.\n\nSpeaking of online, I have not played online with the exception of challenging a few Network Clones.  To that end, I felt really underpowered.  I landed tons more hits than my opponents and yet they still won.  The time you invest in this game unlocking things, leveling up, buying ninja tools, etc certainly does give you an edge.  The players I battled were level 30ish.  Battles do come down to skill but it's tougher when you are matched up against more seasoned players so that's something to keep in mind.\n\nOverall, I would totally recommended this game.  I reiterate that this feels like more of a $40 game but there is tons of value there, regardless of the price point.  I recommend Revolution without hesitation if you love fighting games, anime, and/or Naruto but temper expectations just a little bit.  IF you're super picky, I'm sure you will find glaring flaws. =oP","January 4","true","34.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The net code for this game is so utterly abysmal as to make nearly every encounter I have had online an unplayable mess do to constant lag and the almighty "transmitting" popup which continuously pauses the game when you have a poor connection , and I was hosting same region games.\n\nAnother thing that I find disgusting about this game is the lack of a good story mode. The Akatsuki campaign is really cool in terms of story, but is sinfully short and made of of only basic free mode style battles. The Ninja World Tournament lacks any real narrative structure. To some players this shortcoming may be offset by the variety in combat but this was not the case to me as collecting point orbs seemed too far removed from the fantasy a game like this should offer. As for the Mecha-Naruto campaign, you'll either find it hilarious (if you're the kind of person who enjoys filler content in anime) or hate it with such a passion that you consider ending your own miserable life (if you're the kind of person who has any measure of good taste).\n\nAll in all I would advise any who may read this to skip this game and simply pick up the cheaper and more content complete Ninja Storm 3.","May 23, 2015","false","3.9"," 57 of 108 people (53%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","53","57","108","10","1"

I would suggest checking out the older Naruto title on steam, which does have a very deep story mode. This game was made to test new systems, along with give fans something to play while the story from the manga is finished. There are only three side stories and one short video clip in this title, along with a repeatable game mode (+online and what you come to expect from any fighter).  The replayable game mode battle system changes slightly with each replay along with opening new zones, this adds some new challenges to each reply. This game is great, if you want to play and test out all the characters in the Naruto world. There's over 100 characters and three different battle types for each. Some of the "100" characters are just reskins, while other reskins totally change the moves and how that fighter attacks. For example there's at least 10 different versions of Naruto. However he only really has around 4 move sets, which you can see when choosing. Adding combo finishers does make it fun testing out new teams, and see what abilities they use together. This game is great if you just want to sit down and fight it out and don't care to see the whole story over again. It isn't for anyone just jumping in and hoping to learn the lore of the Ninja world.","September 23, 2014","true","14.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The game is almost exactly like 3 only with less content, yes less content.\n\nThey got rid of all the good singleplayer modes from 3 and replaced it with terrible story modes that made me want to skip through cutscenes just so I could hurry up and finish through the tediousness. The ninjs escapades was a nice touch as it contained content from the show and brought back the old generations style of play (story relevant to the show with simple one on one battles that allow you to unlock new content if beaten. However ninja escapades is beatable in an hour or 2 including the cutscenes and not worth buying the whole game for.\n\nIn theory the tournament mode where you can fight more than one opponent was a good idea and something that I was looking forward to. Sadly it feels terribly underdone and could have been majorly improved on, plus it's only playable in singleplayer which seems like a stupid idea, if you're making a gamemode that is designed to have multiple people fight at the same time why the hell would you lock it to just singleplayer? Seems like a major missed opportunity that they were to lazy to implement.\n\nThey barely added anything new to this game that makes it worth buying if you already have 3 and if you don't have 3 then buy that since it's cheaper and a way better option. I should also mention that the one major pro to this game is how much better the AI is however with the singleplayer mode being rubbish this game is only worth playing with other people.","January 22","false","8.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

This game follow a "filler" history to discover the best ninja in the world and some others alternatives story.\nThis time, you will play those filler histories, like in Storm 2 and 3. Walking around the world and discovering new quests and items.\n\nOne of the best things you will find on this game, is the new A.I. Unlike the others games of series, this one have the most powerful A.I. for combat in the series. The enemies are unpredictable on maximum difficulty, they focus so much to attack you when you have no Chackra or Substitution, and may run away/ counterattack, to avoid you to get him in a bad situation.\n\nStill, I haven't played online yet, so I can't talk so much about this, but you now can save some kind of ghost to play for you while you are offline, this ghost tries to copy your movements and gameplay style from the online battles. (Another good thing about the game A.I.)\n\nAll characters I played so far are balanced, the Substitution nows make the character spawn on the correct distance.\n\nUnfortunatly, nothing is perfect, while playing the game for 4 hours, I got minimized 3 times, without any reason.

It is extremely laggy and still has transmission error problems. Full Burst was barely playable, but somehow it got worse in Revolution!!\n\nI have beat the tournament mode (the "equivalent" to a story mode in Full Burst), it took roughly 7 hours (including the ninja escapades) except this game was much easier compared to Full Burst.\n\nAs said before, this is overall a solid improvement over the last game with many more playable characters. Expect this game to take roughly 7-10 hours to complete the tournament mode + ninja escapades and a couple more hours to do the pointless sidequests which do not yield any major rewards. Multiplayer is unplayable and they probably will not fix it (just like they didn't with Full Burst, however I really hope they do).\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nI am going to compare the game to it's Full Burst counterpart and will have my review for that game down below this review. Basically this game is everything I wanted Full Burst to be and more.\n\nFree Roam is much much better, there is still some quick frame drops happening for me, but not anywhere near as bad as the Full Burst free roam. It is actually much more fun too and there is more of a purpose to it in this game than Full Burst.\n\nGraphics are improved as well, the cutscenes were great in Full Burst and same goes for this game (looks exactly like the anime). Overall everything graphic wise to me is improve, from the free roam maps to the in game characters. Great Job!\n\nThe new 4 way combat mode is great, not only are they pretty quick but it is not laggy at all even though there is a lot going on and locking on and off and switching between targets is pretty flawless in my opinion.\n\nThe main game I think is longer too, I have not beaten it yet, However I beat the Full Burst story mode in roughly 7 hours, im a few hours into this game and there is still much more to do.\n\nMore playable characters, enough said about that one.\n\nAwesome new Ultimate Justu when teaming up with the correct support characters, which was not in Full Burst.\n\nNew customization feature for characters which is cool beyond just customizing substitution justu in Full Burst.\n\nTL;DR Full Burst was a pretty good game but this is awesome. Much better overall and well worth the money and support.\n\n\n-----OLD Full Burst Review-----\nIf you're getting this to fight people via the online multiplayer, do not buy it. Over half of the matches you will play will end in a "transmission error" because of the broken servers they use. The publishers also do not plan to fix it anytime soon. If you are buying it for the story and the characters then go for it, it is a fun game with a 7-10 hour single player story line with plenty more to do after you finished it. Also there are tons of playable characters and follows the anime (However if you are not up to the 4th great ninja war arc there will be spoilers).\n\nI DO NOT recommend this game because I bought it for the multiplayer and it barely works and if it does it is extremely laggy. If you plan on playing it for the story, yes it is fun, but save $40 and just watch the anime. The only thing going for it is its fun gameplay (besides the often pointless and laggy "free roam") and the vast amount of characters you can choose from.","September 15, 2014","true","60.2"," 15 of 27 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","15","27","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dustymonster/recommended/272510/","dustymonster","Dustymonster","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dustymonster/","116 products in account","This is one of those games I'm highly indifferent about. Looking back, I wouldn't call this game a bad game at all, in fact I quite enjoyed it. The "story" is comprised of four short stories with some (easy) fights peppered in that expand the lore in the naruto world through the story of the Akatsuki, Itachi and Shisui, a unique story about the new character "Mecha Naruto", along with a 10 minute movie about team Minato which I quite enjoyed. Overall, this will take maybe 2-3 hours to complete. Which is quite  a bit less than I'd expect for a game with such a steep price tag. The replay value is unfortunately nonexistant unless you are looking for the two achievements given for achieving S ranking on the Itachi and Akatsuki mini story lines. However, if you didn't already get these achievements on your first playthrough as these fights are quite easy, you will without a doubt get it on your second. There is also the "Ninja world tournament mode" which I enjoyed quite a bit. In this mode, you can select a character of your choosing (with the exception of all the young characters, which kinda sucks) and duke it out in a four-player brawl against NPCs. Unfortunately, there is no online mode for this. This is really awful since like the rest of the NPCs, they are quite easy to defeat, and offer no real challenge. I will admit by the S+ tournament I was sweating a bit at the intensity, but the difficulty is entirely due to major NPC buffs in the form of a constant "true awakening form" and not a more advanced AI. That being said, I still won it on my first go-around which really ruins the fun of the game. This will most likely take about 5-6 hours to complete (basing off my own time). And overall, you'll get about 7-9 hours of gameplay out of the story if you play to completion. Such a small playtime leaves something of a bitter taste in my mouth considering the price tag of this game. However, if you're seeing my play time, you'll notice I have 100+ hours in this game as of writing this review. This is due to this games' bread and butter, the online mode. However, unfortunately enough for the online mode, the online community has depleted in the two months since this game has come out. This has made finding someone to fight almost a chore and you really have to just open the game and cross your fingers that you'll find someone. Speaking from personal experience, now that the game is about 2 months after launch, it is a very common occurence that you will find noone to battle.Near the games' launch, the online was solid and all you had to worry about was a tiny bit of lag since so many people were on the servers. However, even now that not so many people are using the servers, the lag is still existant if not worse. This is a huge no-no in my opinion for a 1v1 fighter to have any form of lag. Especially to the point of making the game near unplayable at points. This raises a secondary issue in the fact that even if you manage to find someone to play against, that person might have a laggy connection and make your game either near impossible to play, or make your game crash entirely. In total, this game was very fun. But now that the main focus of this game, the online, has fallen into an abyss, I would advise against purchasing this game. Still, for all the fun I had, I think this game is great. 8/10, buy it if you have a time machine or you love wasting money for a couple hours of fun.\n\nEdit: Some grammar corrections / spelling","November 20, 2014","true","167.7"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/udkedae/recommended/272510/","udkedae","Udkedae","http://steamcommunity.com/id/udkedae/","76 products in account","Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution (that's a mouthful) is a great fighting game. The visuals in this series never disappoint, and the tweaks made to the gameplay make it a solid fighter with a bit of strategy set into it.\n(Please note that this doesn't cover all there is in the game. This is a review of what's important to note in the game)\n\nFirst off, the combat. The previous game in the series (Storm 3) had a great mechanic where your support would act according to the type you set for each one of them separately (auto, attack and defense). The possibilities back then were limited by your skill saving up chakra and attacking in coordination with your support characters to fill up the Storm Gauge. In Revolution they've changed it so you choose one single type of combat for your team. These types are broken into:\n\nUltimate Jutsu Type: Allows you to perform an Ultimate Jutsu alone or in coordination with your 2 teammates if your Storm Gauge is filled to the top, however you can't access Awakening or make your teammates attack with you in a regular combo.\n\nAwakening Type: Allows you to access the Awakening state at any time during a fight and True Awakening given your Storm Gauge is filled up. The downside to this is you can't use Ultimate Jutsu and you still won't be able to use your teammates in a regular combo.\n\nDrive Type: Keeps your teammates with you at all times in three different forms: Auto Drive, Defense Drive and Attack Drive. Auto Drive makes your team attack with you during combos and deliver a final blow into your opponent by the end of a regular combo and often protect from Ultimate Jutsu aimed towards you, Defense Drive provides defense from your team when charging chakra or being approached with a Ninja or Chakra Dash, and Attack Drive works pretty much like Auto but without your team taking hits from Ultimate Jutsu for you. This type can’t use Ultimate Jutsu or Awakening mode.\nAll three types can use Jutsu no matter the type and support during team battles.\n\nNew to the series is a single player mode called Ultimate Ninja Tournament. In this mode you and 3 AI controlled opponents fight against each other in the same arena. It's a competition for orbs which are dropped each time a character takes a hit, this will decrease the amount of orbs held by the victim and increase the ones held by the attacker. There are no health bars in this mode but taking a hit when your orb count is at zero will leave you off the battle. The fighter with the most orbs at the end of each round wins. There are of course many hazards in these arena battles, on top of 3 enemies that could gang up on you at any given time.\n\nIt's a fun mode that would replace the Story Mode in a numbered Ultimate Ninja Storm game, and while it's not story heavy every aspect of it nods to what if stories with lots of fan service content.\n\nAnother interesting aspect to the game is the customization. Online Ninja Cards make a return for this entry but character customization is a most welcome add on to the game. You can choose up to 3 accessories to be place on your character's arms, face, back or waist, a substitution item to replace the generic log, and 1 of four Ultimate Jutsu Finish screens for each character. All of these items are unlockable through Ultimate Ninja Tournament mode and by fighting Network Clones online.\n\nThe Ninja Escapades mode lets you play through short anime stories exclusive to the game. The little story they tell goes from gameplay to anime seamlessly, a nice touch that makes it enjoyable as short as it is.\n\nAt the end of the day this game's perfect for those people who like the anime, games and wish to do some fighting online and/or locally, but if you're looking for an epic battle conclusion to the events after Storm 3 you're going to be disappointed (though the character's dialogues are set up to that point in the story arc, which could come as spoilers to those who haven't kept up with the series at some points).\n\nPros:\nMassive character roster\nDiverse customization options\nThe new combat allows you to truly see the type you choose\nFan service all over the place\nCons:\nThe team types are great but not perfect. Some are unfair in the right hands.\nYou can't put accessories on special outfits (Anbu, school, warrior, etc.)\nThe story is there but you have to dig to find it\nHints:\nLearn the basic and new techniques before heading online\nMake sure you try every character to know what you're fighting against\nNever fight someone online if your connection is at 2 bars (let alone 1)\nAfter completing it to 100% I definitely recommend this game. The fan service, the visuals, the music, and the amount of content I did not include in this review make a solid game in the series, and a must if you can't wait for the next numbered entry.","September 30, 2014","true","66.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

DBZ and Naruto are my all time favourites and I've been watching them since I was young. Because of this I've generally bought most releases for both franchises and looked at them through rose tinted glasses.\n\nThis time however is the first time EVER I'm actually sorry I bought the game, Here I'll list why;\n\n- There is no story! It's just 1 Island where you enter the same tournament 6 times with increasing difficulty. It isn't canon, it doesn't make sense and it's reptitive running around doing pointless "fetch this from the other side of the map and bring it back" quests\n\n- You have 3 side stories which last maybe 4-5 fights... History of the Akatsuki (so many inconsistencies with this story I don't even think it's canon), a story about Shisui/Itachi and the coup (nothing here), and Mecha Naruto which is quite frankly... terrible\n\n- For exisitng characters, the moveset hasn't been updated since UNS2 (at least the DBZ Budokai series did this), it's so tiresome seeing the same movesets and animations if you own the other games\n\n- Not THAT many new characters. Yeah they added the Jinchuriki and some updated Edo Tensei characters but left out 7 Ninja Swordsmen, Gold and Silver Brothers and some others who are still only support characters like Cee, Chojuro etc (again same movesets)\n\n- You can complete the "story" (tournaments) in 1 day and unlock all characters however to unlock all items it would take you about 1000 years. The completion time does not scale with the playability! You would just be grinding and grinding and grinding away for minimal rewards like accessories and probably wear your controller out before you got them and by then they will have released another one.\n\nI'm not going to write too much more on this because it doesn't deserve a full review, it literally should have just been an update or dlc for UNS3 Full Burst. I had never listened to naysayers before this game, now I wish I had. Stick to playing previous versions, watch the VERY few new animations on YouTube in about 10 mins and that's all that's changed in the game and save yourself £30 odd quid!","September 17, 2014","false","26.5"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kaitou-Kid/recommended/272510/","Kaitou-Kid","Kaitou","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kaitou-Kid/","635 products in account","From ShonenGameZ.com:\n\nNaruto is one of the most beloved Anime/Manga franchises ever. Some people put it right up there with the likes of One Piece and Dragon Ball Z, and it belongs to the notorious “Big 3″ group, the three highest selling titles in Japan.\n\nWhile this may be true for the Manga and Anime sales, what about the video games? Anime game titles had their day during the PS2 era, where just about anything got a video game. During the PS3 age we started to see established franchises growing, and branches from the main trees of gaming falling off.\n\nThis meant no more Clash of Ninja, Rise of a Ninja, Ninja Chronicles, everything Naruto in gaming would be run by the Ultimate Ninja series, and that left the fate of Naruto on systems in the hands of Bandai Namco and Cyberconnect2. Together, the team has developed some of the prettiest fighters ever, with the Storm games, but when smooth graphics and flashy cutscenes aren’t enough, the team likes to come back and do a game that focuses more on the battle between players.\n\nThat, would be Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution. The Storm series has multiple entries. You have Storm 1, 2, and 3 which are all direct sequels of each other, and follow the main Naruto storyline. Then you have the pair of Generations and Revolution, which focus on side stories, while still introducing characters that are new from the manga/anime. These two titles however focus on one major thing, changes to the battle system.\n\nNaruto Storm Generations gave us the Sub Bar system, tilt cancels, combo cancels, and more. This time around we have more wide spread changes to the game engine with the splitting of three major aspects of your character.\n\nThe Drive, Ultimate, and Awakening types being introduced into the game, limit, and open up your options in weird ways. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages, however Drive type does seem a little unnecessary.\n\nOverall the main battle focus will most likely always remain the same. One button attacking with a few combos and flashy Jutsu, however this time around the changes that were implemented feel almost forced. There really was no reason to split up the different types, and if it was to make the game work better for more hardcore players, it falls flat on its face, due to how unbalanced the system can be.\n\nThe battling is still fun, and you can have some crazy matches against friends and rivals online, or in local multiplayer. You’ll find that a lot of your time is going to be spent in these modes, because what comes next is going to make you want to do so.\n\nThe story mode. The Storm games are actually being noticed more and more for their excellent story telling, and the cutscenes that bring the anime to life. This, should be the case here, however it doesn’t work all that well.\n\nYou have two modes, Ninja Escapades, and Ninja World Tournament. Ninja Escapades will be easy to understand for players of Generations. There are anime cutscenes, you do a few fights, and you get another anime cutscene. These cutscenes are actually done very nicely by the animation studio, however they’re pretty compressed, and it causes the edges in a lot of shots to look pretty bad.\n\nThe actual story that the escapades tell are pretty interesting and they drag you in a bit, however it does feel like as they started to develop these modes, there was a level of laziness. You notice that the first mode is the longest, then the second story is really mostly cutscene, and the final “story” is only cutscene… No battling.. why? Whats the point of that?\n\nThe other mode… Ninja World Tournament, it really is.. something else.\n\nThere really is an effort here to give it some kind of story feel, but there are far too many moments in this mode that make you feel like they were copied and pasted. By block B, you’re going to want to hack the game, mod Shizune, Mabui, and Shikaku into playable characters, and do your ultimate jutsu on them over and over.\n\nIt honestly makes no sense that this mode feels more like an after thought, if even that, because it was one of the things that they advertised the most. The Mecha Naruto side story that comes after you beat the first block of NWT is pretty tasking also.\n\nAbout halfway through, you know whats going to happen. Its like the developers took all of the Cliches from one of the Naruto movies, and pasted Mecha Naruto in. It isn’t terrible, but when I played I couldn’t stop wishing it was over.\n\nOverall, if you’re looking for an updated version of Full Burst, with a different feeling to the battles, new flashy attacks, and a few cool moments, then pick up this title. Its sure to keep you online atleast for a few months until the next game gets announced.\n\nNaruto Shuppuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution gets a 7/10","November 25, 2014","true","4.4"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

Sure they took away the stupid Hack N' Slash from Storm 3, but other than that, and the increased number of characters, this is no way an improvement. While I can see the appeal of splitting up Ultimate, Awakening and Support, it doesn't feel as impressive as Storm 3 where you could use all 3. Also, Kushina. Oh dear.

Judging from advertisements and trailers, this game could be considered scam.\n\n* NO Story mode besides 3 (VERY) short stories, which are done in under 1 hour.\n\n* VERY bad connection. The networking code of this game is horrible. Even if you have a perfect connection, depending on gamemode, you will share your connection speed with your opponent (meaning if he has lags, you have them too).\nThis can result in battles being interrupted all 1-2 second by about 0,5 seconds with "loading" popups.\nJoining other people's lobbies will almost always result in a grave disadvantage for you due to noticable delays.\n\n*Only 4 gamemodes:\n1.) Online battles, which I described above.\n2.) World-Tournament mode, which actually is a mode in which you battle 4 times in each rank from D to S to be crowned best of the world. You can complete extremely short missions between the battles to either gain new comrades (must be done again for each character... ... ...) or to get some money (which is earned much much faster by simply bashing the A.I. in the VS mode over and over and over again) and items...\nBy spending this money on any item on any shop you gain lottery tickets that are your main source for character customization items. It all comes down to a long grind that rewards you with a diminishing chance for new gear.\n3.) Free-for-All -> This is your Local VS Mode, either with friends or the A.I. (which is no match at all)\n4.) Ninja-"Escapades" the sorry excuse for a story mode. Only 3 arcs of which one is just a cinematic with no content worthy to mention. All Episodes together have less than a dozen battles... I mean, c'mon.\n\n*The well anticipated character customization is broken down to choosing an outfit for your character (for example Naruto normal suit, non-combat clothes or samurai armor) and then sticking 3 items of your choice on them (you can choose upper left/right arm, face/masks and upper/lower torso on your back) - NO colour customization, NO renaming, NO haircuts.\n>>108 chars to choose from and they couldn't include a simple shinobi editor<<\n--> Huge disappointment.\nOh well, you can choose from a wide variety of objects to use for your replacement jutsus (dodge mechanic in this game)... Doesn't matter that about 50% of those options is the normal one with a japanese Kanji-tag on them (SO mesmerizing...).\n[Kanji is one of the japanese "alphabets"]\n\n*Each character has only 2 Jutsus: a normal one which knocks down your opponent (for example Rasengan for all Narutos) and an ultimate Nin-Jutsu which is a cinematic driven finishing move, which can be customized to include one of 4 short, voiced sentences accompanied by a static picture IF you finish your oppenent with it. (These 4 options must be unlocked via the lottery or gaining money)\nDepending on which outfit you choose for your character, these two jutsus differ (but only slightly most times, for example Naruto either uses his one clone Rasengan, Double-Rasengan in sage mode or his Rendan as pre-shippuden Naruto [Rendan is a humourus melee-combo utilizing his shadow clones])\n\n*On top of that are horrible, childish dialogues\n[---this game, even though you can toggle "violence" does have no blood whatsoever and all dialogues are cut down to "are you happy?" -no -> let's do something about it -> You DID something about it! -> you are my new BFF!---]\n*And ridiculously common loading screens, you will have to watch the loading icon after almost every action, this is NOT a joke, here is an example:\n\n[PLEASE BEAR IN MIND THIS WAS TESTED ON A TOP OF THE NODGE NEW COMPUTER; I EVEN MOUNTED A RAM DISK FOR JUST FOR THIS -> FASTEST POSSIBLE DISK ACCESS]\n\n::: You start the game, of course, it loads. 4 Logos (skippable), intro "cinematic" (skippable), loading screen, select game mode on main menu, loading screen, select action in submenu, loading screen (for this example I choose World Tournament mode), now you choose to either load your save or start a new game, LOADING SCREEN, skippable cinematic, skippable cinematic, loading screen, unnessecarily long dialogue with Shizune and Mabui at the beach. Now you can walk across the beach. From one end ot another it takes about 15 seconds run time... but still entering another areal of the tournament isle will start a LOADING sequence (at least this one is only about 1-2 seconds). Opening the menu has a severe delay of about 2-3 seconds, entering ANY subcthegory of this menu will show you a LOADING SCREEN. :::\nYou get the idea?\nIn addition to this, canceling out of most submenus will throw you back at the main menu for that game menu, even canceling out of a submenu will start a loading sequence...\n\n*And last but not least, several characters are severely imbalanced. Picking Deidara for example will yield you a win in about 80% of all fights by simply spamming your Kunai(ranged attack)-Action (Deidaras kunai special is a quickly spammable explosive-clay-bird barrage).\n\n*The only positive things about this game are\n1.) the massive roster of choosable shinobi (as said, 108), including all known kages, Madara, Obito (Tobi) and many child-versions of the Shippuden characters\n2.) the new network clone feature where you can customize up to 3 shinobi A.I. characters from which you can send out one at a time to gain levels and bring back items for you. The higher the level, the better the item.\nThese clones are uploaded into a cloud and will appear randomly in games of other players (in world tournament mode these will stand around and wait for your challenge, in online mode, these will randomly appear after a fight and challenge you).\nBeating these clones will reward you that character, including their equipment. (Getting that badass greatsword to carry on my characters back from a random fight felt awesome... but that sword cannot be used, it is only decorational)\n\nI will say this as clear as I can: DO NOT BUY\n\n\n\nP.S.: If you only want to buy this for the playable characters, unlocking all of them only takes about one day of continously battling in any gamemode (If you win with S-Rank most of the time).","September 17, 2014","false","22.3"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

In terms of story, the only real story mode involves a huge ninja tournament, so, no actual story. The only story it tells is the "Ninja Escapades" where you find out how the Akatsuki was formed, and the truth behind Shisui and Itachi.\nIn terms of gameplay, this one is the best.

Characters are split into three categories. Awakening mode allows you access to your awakenings, but robs you of use of your ultimate jutsu. Ultimate jutsu mode, gives you access to such, and Drive mode, allows you more frequent and helpful use of your team amtes. This may seem dumb but with how powerful some characters are, this is a great way to balance the game. All of these plus watching your characters combo moves to learn when to cancel into jutsu maes the game wasy to learn, difficult to master. And there are so many cross-up oppurtunities when mixing in your supports. FANS/PLAYERS OF TEH SERIES:This game will feel rather fresh if you've grown to know the mechincs of teh game. NEWCOMERS:Wait for a price drop if you really want to try it. For veterans, if you want me to expalin how much has changed in teh game, message me.","October 28, 2014","true","56.7"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

If you play the Naruto games so you catch up on the story without watching all the filler like I do, then prepare to be dissapointed. The story (if you can call it that) is four short sequences one of which has no impact on the show or manga at all, the other three are exactly what i wanted to avoid by playing the game filler, they explain background on some of the past experiances of certain groups. The tournement is complete crap it's not challenging at all, the point of the fight is to gather orbs which in my oppinion defeats the fighting game stlye that we got in the past. The missions you do outside of the tournement to gain allies arnt really relevant when you gain one team because you're already OP. The fighting is the same as our last naruto game beside that now, instead of being able to go into our ultimate form and be able to use our ultimate in the same fight you have to choose which one you'd rather have, (which frankly is just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥) we should be able to use everything just like in the previous games. Some of the characters you unlock from the "story" cant even be used in the tournement shuch as all the young versions of Naruto and his friends, as well as mecha Naruto. The customization is pretty much a joke, you can change what scene shows up when you use you're ultimate which is nice as well as change what you're substitutuion looks like. But the stuff you put on your character is joke stuff you dont get to change their outfit at all and you're limited to Three items you can put on. The tournement matches consist of 1v1v1v1 free for all which is a lie because the enemies all attack you, you cannot use your ultimate in these battles only your basic.\n\nSo i would recomend you wait for the next game or wait for this to come out for like $15 because thats all its really worth","September 16, 2014","false","17.8"," 10 of 19 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","10","19","0","0"

But sadly I can't watch the shows in jap. I just hate the voices, they are so dumb to me. So I wait a week just to see one episode, an 80 percent of the time it's a filler episode. This game was going to save me from that. To show me the rest of shippuden where we left off from the other game. But no... They replaced the story mode with this stupid ninja world arena where you pick up their balls to win. This is beyond stupid... It's not even a challenge. They advertised "Oh hey you get to see how the akastuki was created" Yea... Watch the video it only lasts about half an hour. That was the high light of this game. Yea some of you may think "This is a fighting only game, who gives a ♥♥♥♥ about the story mode" Well clearly you aren't a naruto fan if you bought this game just to fight. Don't get me wrong, the fighting is fun. It's better than before. But that does not make up for the fact that they ejected the story mode out of the game. Honestly, what would prompt them to make this choice? They couldn't possibly think a majority of the die hard naruto fans would be pleased by this.\n\n\n\n\n\nOver all this game is ok. If you look at it from a "I love to fight" view, it's a 7. If you look at it from "I am a huge naruto fan and I want to see what happens to my favorite characters" then this game is a 3. At best. Just because of the creation of akastuki was cool. But it was extremely short and you didn't even get to see how Itachi, kisame, and others were recruited. Another reason it got a higher score is because of the brother uchiha. I love Itachi the most in this anime, and his friend is just amazing, and I love him just as much. But even that didn't last long.\n\n\nThis game, from a die hard naruto fan, is utter crap.\n\n\nThis game from a fighter only standpoint, is OK at best. Because if you do decide to do ranked games, or online battles, most of the time it's just constant "transmitting..." and that just ruins the fun.","September 16, 2014","false","28.0"," 13 of 25 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","13","25","0","0"

So when i started playing few days ago i realised tournament modes sucks. It's just pathetic even to call it mode.Ninja Escapades mode is something that most of players want some cutscenes and head to head combat,evan hack and slash would be appreciated,but it's not essencial. So in my opinion you should buy previous game becouse there you will find everything you wanted be in this game and unfortunately there is not. You will find decent story mod,don't be fooled with multiplayer,it ain't anything special.Plus this game has no love for keyboard. if you dont have gamepad,trust me on this one, don't get the game.Only thing good in this game are verious characters and fighting mechanics are improved, but after all of this negative aspects of game it ain't much.\n\nThank you for taking your time time to read my review,also sorry for my bad english i'm  still learnig it,and if it's not much please rate this review how ever you want so i can i see other people other people's opinions.\n\nOnce again thank you for your time and have a wonderfull day.","September 18, 2014","false","17.2"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

The most disappointing part of this game? THERE IS NO STORY MODE. WHY DID YOU REMOVE STORY MODE, BANDAI?!  Tournament mode has some cutscene dialogues but its theme is like some lame filler from the anime. It doesnt link up with anime at all.  Ninja Escapades are short stories from the anime timeline, like the creation of Akatsuki, which was never shown in the anime, but there are only 4 stories, and each last about 30mins at most.\n\nThe combat mechanics have improved a little, which is good.. there is now 3 types you can choose from for your character, Utimate Jutsu type, Awakening type and Drive type.. Each of which has their strengths and weaknesses. This adds variety and more choices to your fighting style.\n\nOverall I would give this game a 5/10.. If your intentions are buying this game for epic story like in UNS3, save your $65.\nIf you do not watch the anime or the manga but are just a fan of the game, you will probably will not be as hype when you see the new chars available.","September 21, 2014","false","19.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The new characters are amazing and I pretty much can't stop playing this game. I have already put over 44 hours into this game and it has only been released for a little over three days. I'm not a fan of online so I have no idea what it is like, and I don't plan on knowing. I strictly stay with having a bunch of friends come over to play the game for hours on end.\nI have played this game non-stop and I still haven't finished all there is to offer. I do feel the the challenges are quite repetitive, but still good. The Battle Orb tournements I feel is a bit broken. I would understand why 3v1 happens to me when I have over 6k orbs, but when all four start with 1k and all three are still coming after me, it becomes quite annoying.\nAnother entertaining thing you can do in this game is set up artificial boss fights in practice mode with the specific characters. So far the flaws I have found in this game are as followed: During free roam random characters eyes will glitch out causing them to go big and small constantly. Another is that some of the accessories don't fit characters very well causing them to glitch through the characters body. My final complaint is character specific accessories. I was really hoping you could have a really wide range of accessories, but all of the really "cool" items are character specific. This was kind of a let down.\nAll in all, I do recommend this game to anyone who is a huge fan of the Naruto Series, or likes slightly strategic storm-based fighting games.","September 19, 2014","true","67.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

They did focus a lot on the multiplayer, which is a good thing. They even expanded the character roster which is awesome.

This game is a solid game and a decent addition to the storm series for a few reasons, though it is held back a little by lacking story content to a large degree. To be fair, there hasn't been much story progression from the anime/manga since storm 3, so I'm not really surprised to see them offer more filler based content in this iteration.\n\nThe story content is based around 3 very short 'escapades' that involve some animation in-between battles, these backstories revolve around the Akatsuki, Itachi and Shisui Uchiha and Kakashi's former team mates when they were younger. There is also the Mecha-Naruto story line, although I wouldn't count that as much of a narrative, while funny and slightly heartwarming, its execution was a little lacking and isn't much of a story by itself.\n\nBeyond the lacking story content however is where we get to the meat of the game, and ultimately, the part where it shines the most. That would be the gameplay. While not too much of an overhaul, since this game runs on the same engine as the previous title, new battle mechanics as well as offering meaningful choice in how to play your characters really do add polish to the system.\n\nWithin this new system, players are offered the choice of 3 different types of set up for any given character, these types are Ultimate Jutsu, Awakening and Drive. UJ allows your character to perform their ultimate jutsu, and when their storm bar is full (a new mechanic) they can peform a team ultimate jutsu that executes a combo before their UJ is done. The upside of picking this is that UJ is much easier to land when using all the members of your team as a proxy for the technique (if even one of the 3 characters connects in dash, the technique is cast). For the Awakening type, you can do just that, anyone picking this has access to both Instant Awakening and True Awakening. IA has its advantages for both comboing attacks and also adding strength to the fight when you need it (balanced by reducing max chakra, thereby making it impossible to awaken breifly after using IA). True Awakening if actually used in a fight adds a lot of extra power and in some characters cases an almost boss-like presence on the battefield while in this state, this is something that can really turn the fight around. Drive types revolve around teamwork and automatic support, in order to balance not having either IA/True Awakening or UJ/team UJ's anyone using this type can count on automatic support as well as switching support focus during battle, on top of this supports knocked out during the fight may revive after a period of time has passed. The drive type's only trump card is the ability to seal both UJ's and Awakening types abilities for a short period of time.\n\nAlso of note, in this iteration of the storm series, customisation has been added, you can now edit your characters looks with accessories as well as their Substitution item and the video that plays upon a successful UJ finisher. Allowing both visual customisation, as well as focus choice really lets someone play how they would want to play, obviously its not the most in-depth customisation system, but it is a very welcome addition to the game.\n\nAdding to this is some new battle mechanics, along with the usual Sub/Guard defence, a counter mechanic and guard break attack have been added, these new mechanics are balanced by their use of resources (reduction of max chakra for counter and ammo system for guard break). With these, and all previous options from the last game, as well as character focus types, present a lot more depth within fights than was seen in storm 3. There are now few more options for both the defending and attacking player, which leads to more interesting fights overall.\n\nOf course, all of this is to speak nothing of the visuals of the game itself. It is quite a beautiful game, the style of the characters is very faithful to the animation style of the anime, and the environments to fight in are just as great to look at as the characters themselves. Add to this the technique animations, including the new awakenings/Special team ultimate jutsu's and this game certainly does not disappoint on the eye candy factor.\n\nI have very few issues with this game, but there were a few things to stick out. Firstly, while the ninja world tournament mode is great, and a fun diversion, the amount of redundant content is a bit too much. There are challanges and 'jobs' on top of recruitment quests for this mode, and while recruitment quests aren't all that bad, there are a LOT of jobs to be done. Case in point, there were at almost 20 jobs for each rank of the tournament I have been in so far, and a vast majority are just the standard 1v1 with supports or the 4v4 orb brawl mode with only one or two being anything different and all of these fights have no real story context. Add to this the challanges of each rank and you have a sizable list of content to get through. The trouble is that it all feels quite repetative after a while, leading to the realisation that the developer added these almost grind like elements mainly for the completionists and to give longevity to what would have otherwise been a short mode.\n\nAll in all, here are the pros/cons for this game.\n\nPros:\n\nNew focus types/Customization add to personal choice\nEnvironments and characters are as beautiful as ever\nAwakening/UJ/Team UJ animations are awesome\nNew fight mechanics on top of old help to make the fights more interesting than the last game\nNaruto and Sasuke Swapping outfits had me fanboying a little, smart move CC2\nShisui Uchiha and Kurama mode Naruto as playable characters? yespls\nCons:\n\nLack of longer story content could upset a few fans\nRedundant content in the Ninja tournament mode is a little annoying\nWhile I enjoyed the Mecha-Naruto story somewhat, I can see why a lot of people couldn't take his addition to the game seriously\nDanzo exists\n\nIn summary, this game is better than storm 3, gameplay wise and I suppose graphics wise and is a solid title in itself, but the lack of story content may irk some fans (though it doesn't bother me to much) and the amount of redundant content in the nina world tournament mode may get on the nerves of some completionists.\n\nI give it, 7/10.\n\n","September 18, 2014","true","2.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

To be fair, there hasn't been much story progression from the anime/manga since storm 3, so I'm not really surprised to see them offer more filler based content in this iteration.\n\nThe story content is based around 3 very short 'escapades' that involve some animation in-between battles, these backstories revolve around the Akatsuki, Itachi and Shisui Uchiha and Kakashi's former team mates when they were younger. There is also the Mecha-Naruto story line, although I wouldn't count that as much of a narrative, while funny and slightly heartwarming, its execution was a little lacking and isn't much of a story by itself.\n\nBeyond the lacking story content however is where we get to the meat of the game, and ultimately, the part where it shines the most. That would be the gameplay. While not too much of an overhaul, since this game runs on the same engine as the previous title, new battle mechanics as well as offering meaningful choice in how to play your characters really do add polish to the system.\n\nWithin this new system, players are offered the choice of 3 different types of set up for any given character, these types are Ultimate Jutsu, Awakening and Drive. UJ allows your character to perform their ultimate jutsu, and when their storm bar is full (a new mechanic) they can peform a team ultimate jutsu that executes a combo before their UJ is done. The upside of picking this is that UJ is much easier to land when using all the members of your team as a proxy for the technique (if even one of the 3 characters connects in dash, the technique is cast). For the Awakening type, you can do just that, anyone picking this has access to both Instant Awakening and True Awakening. IA has its advantages for both comboing attacks and also adding strength to the fight when you need it (balanced by reducing max chakra, thereby making it impossible to awaken breifly after using IA). True Awakening if actually used in a fight adds a lot of extra power and in some characters cases an almost boss-like presence on the battefield while in this state, this is something that can really turn the fight around. Drive types revolve around teamwork and automatic support, in order to balance not having either IA/True Awakening or UJ/team UJ's anyone using this type can count on automatic support as well as switching support focus during battle, on top of this supports knocked out during the fight may revive after a period of time has passed. The drive type's only trump card is the ability to seal both UJ's and Awakening types abilities for a short period of time.\n\nAlso of note, in this iteration of the storm series, customisation has been added, you can now edit your characters looks with accessories as well as their Substitution item and the video that plays upon a successful UJ finisher. Allowing both visual customisation, as well as focus choice really lets someone play how they would want to play, obviously its not the most in-depth customisation system, but it is a very welcome addition to the game.\n\nAdding to this is some new battle mechanics, along with the usual Sub/Guard defence, a counter mechanic and guard break attack have been added, these new mechanics are balanced by their use of resources (reduction of max chakra for counter and ammo system for guard break). With these, and all previous options from the last game, as well as character focus types, present a lot more depth within fights than was seen in storm 3. There are now few more options for both the defending and attacking player, which leads to more interesting fights overall.\n\nOf course, all of this is to speak nothing of the visuals of the game itself. It is quite a beautiful game, the style of the characters is very faithful to the animation style of the anime, and the environments to fight in are just as great to look at as the characters themselves. Add to this the technique animations, including the new awakenings/Special team ultimate jutsu's and this game certainly does not disappoint on the eye candy factor.\n\nI have very few issues with this game, but there were a few things to stick out. Firstly, while the ninja world tournament mode is great, and a fun diversion, the amount of redundant content is a bit too much. There are challanges and 'jobs' on top of recruitment quests for this mode, and while recruitment quests aren't all that bad, there are a LOT of jobs to be done. Case in point, there were at almost 20 jobs for each rank of the tournament I have been in so far, and a vast majority are just the standard 1v1 with supports or the 4v4 orb brawl mode with only one or two being anything different and all of these fights have no real story context. Add to this the challanges of each rank and you have a sizable list of content to get through. The trouble is that it all feels quite repetative after a while, leading to the realisation that the developer added these almost grind like elements mainly for the completionists and to give longevity to what would have otherwise been a short mode.\n\nAll in all, here are the pros/cons for this game.\n\nPros:\n\nNew focus types/Customization add to personal choice\nEnvironments and characters are as beautiful as ever\nAwakening/UJ/Team UJ animations are awesome\nNew fight mechanics on top of old help to make the fights more interesting than the last game\nNaruto and Sasuke Swapping outfits had me fanboying a little, smart move CC2\nShisui Uchiha and Kurama mode Naruto as playable characters? yespls\nCons:\n\nLack of longer story content could upset a few fans\nRedundant content in the Ninja tournament mode is a little annoying\nWhile I enjoyed the Mecha-Naruto story somewhat, I can see why a lot of people couldn't take his addition to the game seriously\nDanzo exists\n\nIn summary, this game is better than storm 3, gameplay wise and I suppose graphics wise and is a solid title in itself, but the lack of story content may irk some fans (though it doesn't bother me to much) and the amount of redundant content in the nina world tournament mode may get on the nerves of some completionists.\n\nI give it, 7/10.\n\n","September 18, 2014","true","2.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

If you expect a online multiplayer game then you will be disappointed. There also isn't much of of story. But on the flip side is it a really good fighting game that I love playing. The local multiplayer is really fun as well. So if you want a fighting game with an okay story, bad online, but is really fun to just mess around with, then this is the game for you.

This game is a must play for gamers who enjoy Naruto. The graphics are the best yet and the gameplay is the best the series has had and I have played all versions and every storm game made. The online is working and is just as it is in the console version  if your pc meets the requiements and you have a decent internet connection.\n\nI cant recomend this game enough I am glad I preordered and it was even made available earlier than expected. I still have not beaten the game after a few days and there is much to unlcock.  The real bread and butter is the battles and online battle modes and everything works just as it should.

Might just want to stick to the usual. Customisation is fun though, and the tournament setting is kind of nice if you stay open-minded about it.\n\nAnd like I said, it's fun, though maybe you don't want to get it at full price.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/IrisSapphire/recommended/272510/","IrisSapphire","Sassy Tanassy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/IrisSapphire/","222 products in account","If you came here looking for a story, you'll have to turn your head towards last year's Storm 3: Full burst. But this game shines above and beyond the rest of the series in it's mechanics, fun factor and character selection. You can check out my Storm 3 review to see what the game's mechanics are like, as here I'll mostly be stating what's new.\n\nThe Ultimate Ninja games have always been all about easy to pick up, yet surprisingly technical combat scenarios that replicate the franchise's most defining elements. The way you play this series has always depended on what kind of character you choose, but now there's even more variety and balance to add into the mix with new ways to use support, and the decision between using Ultimate attacks, awakening mode, or playing defensively with support backing you up and the ability to seal others' attacks.\n\nWhere the game lacks in story it makes up for in a new element called World Tournament. For the first time in this series of games, you can take part in 4-person battles, the meat of this mode in where the objective is basically to beat the crap out of everyone and steal their orbs, with the person obtaining the most orbs being the winner after time has elapsed. It's a fun new mode and actually makes some characters who are not so useful in 1v1 situations seem more viable, but it also serves as a way just to have fun and try out each character's abilities. The rest of this World Tournament mode involves running around this new island, fighting against CPUs, unlocking characters, and even fighting the "Ghosts" of other players.\n\nSomething else new to this game is character customisation. Besides being able to change your character's costume, you can also equip accessories on them, change their substitution items, and even their Ultimate Jutsu finish quotes.\n\nThis is basically Storm 3.5, and it's for the fans more than anything else, but it's a fun game in it's own right and it puts the gameplay front and centre to the experience. It's all about fighting. Whether it's one on one with or without support or World Tournament mode, this game offers a lot of hours of just pure fighting goodness, and without being as overly technical as other fighting franchises.\n\nOn a technical level, the game is drop-dead gorgeous in motion. But once again, there's no way to tweak the game's settings or framerate and the only AA option available is a resource hog, killing my game despite having an SLI setup that provides 60FPS in most of today's games. Thankfully, turning off AA doesn't ruin the game's look, and at 1080p you still have a damn beautiful, smooth game that feel fantastic to play. This is the closest I've seen a game look to it's actual Anime series, it's merely a shame the port seems so rushed.\n\nDo i recommend it? Absolutely. I enjoyed it, and still continue TO enjoy it even more than I enjoyed previous games in the series. But as I said, don't expect story on the level of Storm 3-- the Story this game has to offer is short and sweet, and mostly for veterans.","September 27, 2014","true","21.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nzdenom/recommended/272510/","nzdenom","NZ Denom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nzdenom/","105 products in account","I finally beat the game. The Escapades, Mecha-Naruto Story, The Tournament and the Ally Events. (But not all of the Challenges and Jobs, those are mindless Time-wasters.)\n\nNaruto Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution was the most entertaining filler in my opinion. It made me laugh, cry (Literally..), and also made me.. very angry at times (that wore off after a while).\n\nThe first thing i started with when i got this game was the ninja escapades. The anime scenes were quite entertaining, and felt like an actual episode of Naruto Shippudden. I like how they got rid of the quick time events for the cutscenes, i just wanted to sit back and relax after a fight i had won, I got that.. and more.\nThe Akatsuki Origins were fun and easy to blast through, and it was fun to watch the cutscenes that played between each fight. The story of the Akatsuki origins in this game starts at the point where Deidara and the rest were just getting recruited and not before the Hanzo incident. Itachi and Kisame's joining wasn't included as well.\nThe Itachi/Shisui Storyline was Incredibly entertaining to play through and watch, revealing facts and expanding on who Shisui was, and it includes some bonding between characters that.. I hate to say it, made me cry.. The good feels, ya know?\nAfter you finish the first two escapades, you are rewarded a short episode with team Minato, with Kushina.\n\nNow to the Mecha Naruto Story.. *sigh* Basically the type of story that was used in this has been dragged through countless arks and fillers.. Mecha naruto feels like an outsider, a freak and alone, and he feels just like Naruto did in the begining Bla Bla Bla. I'm not sorry for being harsh towards this story with Mecha Naruto, My feels were depleted after the legit Gaara story. It got less appealing to watch when it was recycled for Sora and Isaribi.\n\nFinally we get to the Tournament part. Basically, you mash buttons untill you win, in a 4 person arena where you collect orbs that Drop when you hit enemies and drop boxes.. Have fun repeating that untill you get that Ultimate Steam Achievements!!.. the game awards you small accesories that you can't equip unless you're playing as a character who's wearing their main costume.. Ultimate Customisation my a-.. sorry.\n\nWhile I enjoyed the Ninja Escapades A Lot, the rest was mildly entertaining at best.\nBecause I played the Rise of a Ninja and The Broken Bond Games on the Xbox 360. I was not pleased with the free roam.. it was an annoyance, it was not fun, it was slow, it was lifeless, with the most boring side missions that included running from point A to B with fights thrown in.\n\nI'd give this game a 6/10. My scoring relies on the fun i had in the ninja escapades, the character roster, the lazy attempt at trying to appeal to the free roam thing they forgot that people wanted, and the Ultimate team moves that were thrown in for awesome fan service.\n\nMy suggestion for the next game is to bring in some F@$%ing Voice acting!! This isn't a PS1/PSP game, Jeez. Pressing the prompt button to get the next speech bubble was Irritating, I was interested in what the characters had to say but in this case, the characters were hollow and without F@$%ING VOICE!!!!\nAnd please expand on the Free Roam (as in exploration and worthwhile bonuses, similar to UNS1 and The Xbox 360 Exclusives), you got the fighting mechanics down 100% and i am Greatful for that!! you can put some of your efforts elsewhere too now!!","September 30, 2014","true","30.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Its a HUGE DLC and doesn't bring much new to the games. Its call of dutty all over again. Release the same game every year but with different maps and guns. Here is adding 1 or 2 new characters, a few new modes... and its done.\nIf you play for the online, you're doomed. It sucks. If you play for the offline, you're doomed. Its just decent. Not something i'd advise you to get, even if it had a 50% discount. MAYBE if you find it at 80%... but bellow? never. (PS: Sales need to be AFTER the price drops. 49.99€ 80% off... still not worth it).\nIt lacks everything to be considered a game. Its not BAD, its just repetitive. I bought it, but since i don't care for the story at all, im ok with it. However, if you do care for it, this is absolutely a waste of cash time and effort for you.\n\nI really don't know what to say about this game other than it lacks ... A lot. So i'll just give it my personal score.\n\nScore: 5/10 (Lacks work, lacks inovation, same game as the previous one with tiny small changes, some of them even for the worse other than for better.

But compared to the other naruto games it sucks. The different fighting types makes the characters stripped of their powers and makes you feel limited to what you can truly do with the character you're playing as. The counter mechanic needs to be taken out in storm 4, it ruins the flow of the game and all you need to really do is spam that counter to win. Plus, they only added maybe 12-15 new characters,the rest are the exact same characters from the previous games with unedited movesets that make it seem like you just bought the same game twice but with barely any content added. Now finally the 4 player tournament mode is just a mess, it's hard not to get frustrated to do one simple combo on one of the fighters without getting attacked by OP characters in the tournament every 5 seconds. This type of problem doesn't occur until you get to the B ranked matches in world tournament. Once again the online services are mediocre since there is lag constantly in every fight you play against someone in, this is dissapointing because you think that CC2 would learn from storm 3 full burst, but if anything the online is the same if not worse. This is by far the worst storm game, I'll only play it because there is literally no one playing online for storm 3 anymore. All I will say now is just skip this game, wait a little bit, and get storm 4.","December 29, 2014","false","333.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

However, there are many problems with it, and I had to debate whether I should thumbs up this game, or thumbs down it. First, let's start with the pros:\n\n+ Stays true to the anime/manga\n+ Much better balancing than Storm 3\n+ A fun fighting game that can potentially give you 75+ hours of gameplay, if you're committed enough to online battles\n\nThere are not that many, as you can see. Now, lets move on to the neutral arguments:\n\n= There is no story focus in this game, as the story doesn't get you through even 3 hours of gameplay\n= Not that easy for someone new to the game, as COM's can only make you so good, and many people online are heavily experienced\n= You will most likely need a controller to achieve a certain level of mastery in this game (Keyboard doesn't cut it)\n\nAnd finally, let's look at the long list of cons\n\n- EXTREMELY BAD LAG ISSUES WHEN PLAYING ONLINE ; Almost 90% of your matches will have some input delay, and you will encounter many "Transmitting matches" as well (This is when your online battle will constantly be interrupted by a dialogue prompt that freezes your match for ~0.5 seconds. It reads, "Transmitting" and at worst, can appear every second\n- Many bugs ; for example, many peoples' games crash upon encountering a certain event (Sage Mode Hashirama going into True Awakening mode)\n- Almost no one plays this game anymore on the PC, so online lobbies are desolate wastelands\n- Not enough special team ultimate jutsu ; Guy and Lee don't have one, Hinata and Neji don't have one, etc.\n- Character selection is extremely repetitive ; There are around 5 playable Naruto's/Sasuke's, but we aren't able to play as Ginkaku/Kinkaku, or all of the 7 Swordsmen of the Mist\n- Peer to peer connection ; We need some dedicated servers\n- Not a cheap game ; It's 50 Euro and 45 if you have the previous game (Storm 3)\n\nSo there. Now you decide for yourself. I personally enjoy this game very much, but only because I'm a Naruto fanboy. If you aren't a diehard Naruto fan, I would probably wait for a big sale or just pass on this one.\n\nTLDR ; If you're a diehard Naruto fan, you will probably enjoy this game. However, be prepared for lag issues, trouble finding matches online, and wishing for more characters in the roster. If not, pass on it and wait for them to (hopefully) fix all of these errors in the next game.","October 26, 2014","false","177.7"," 11 of 23 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","11","23","0","0"

Revolution is NOT worth your time if this is what you want. There is minimal story, minimal variation in characters, and the one cool thing about the game (1v1v1v1) Isn't even multiplayer, so no 2v2 awesomeness. Mecha-Naruto is Ech at best, and not worth the extra time put in to unlock it. In the other game the awesome fights are set up FOR you, and these fights have choices, extra mid-fight scenes, etc.\nIn general, the other game is more fun. I played this for a few hours and got VERY bored, whereas Full Burst on ps3 I had 100%ed. And what the hell is up with most characters? They all fight very similarly and are grouped into different classes, as I see it - ranged, close combat or OP-as-♥♥♥♥-kills-everything. Balancing was done, but it sorta takes away some of the fun.\nAnd the part that pains me most? £40. Wasted. It should be around £25, maybe £20. £30 at a push, not more. Spend £15 on Full Burst - or less on a sale - and have a WAY better time.","March 2, 2015","false","7.3"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","1"

It has the most enjoying combat system by my likes. It's fast paced, while keeping it simple so anyone can join the combat. The ideas for combos and landing the hits are well implemented, along with the realistic hitboxes.\n\nThe new features are also funny and I count them as an improvement from Ninja Storm 3. Also the addition of a single button dodge (LT) is coming in very handy and it's something that was really missing from the previous title. I'm still new in the game and I will post again with more details.\n\nThe big con here, is that the game doesn't have a story mode. BUT! Did anyone complained when we were playing Street Fighter, Dragon Ball or similar games about the story mode? We repeated the same fights over and over again, until our thumbs were hurting so much, that we'd stop doing combos!\n\nFor those that look into a combat game, I highly recommend this. Therefor for those who want to have an 80 hours gameplay-story game, better try elsewhere.\n\nSee you online everyone!\nSincerely,\neThi","November 10, 2014","true","20.0"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BlooTheHedgehog/recommended/272510/","BlooTheHedgehog","Bloo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BlooTheHedgehog/","138 products in account","Major online lag, lack of story and a feeling that there should be more content other than the massive amount of characters keeps this game from being more than ok to the general public. I can already tell you I only love this game because of the Naruto part of it. The Ninja World Tournament mode and Mecha Naruto story were both short, had a small amount of fights, and weren't too intresting. The ninja escapades (OVAs) had very few fights across the three, but I suppose that makes sense. They should've really just been extras you could've unlocked, like the ultimate jutsu videos. They had a nice story though...despite lasting around 40 minuets for all 3 combined.\nThe actual combat featured in the game is extremley simple but fun in my opinon. If you like hitting the same few buttons in same manner for each character, you'll find the game fun. Don't go looking for Tekken or BlazBlue levels of complexity levels here. The character  roster spans over 100 characters, but each plays exactly like each other with few differences. For example, one combo might send the reciever farther into the air than another character, but it won't make too much of a difference. The only major difference between each character is their jutsu and it doesn't help too much to differentiate every character that well. "Why should I play as Asuma instead of Mecha-Naruto? They're exactly the same for almost everything but one move." Online is very, very laggy, and you shouldn't play this game for the online, just the offline.\nI thought the game's anime style is beautiful, despite having looked exactly the same since Naruto: Ultimate Ninja STORM on PS3 way back when. They really don't need to change it because it looks just like it is a 3D anime, which is what the game is aiming for.\nIn conclusion: Don't get it  unless you like Naruto, or have had a run through a demo. Wait for a sale on it if you're on the fence. I would recommend this to my friends because I enjoy it, but THEY might not enjoy it as much as me unless they like Naruto as well. Stay safe with this one.","September 25, 2014","false","30.7"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","1"

I was hoping for Team 8 CUJ, Team 10 CUJ etc. Some CUJ's have characters that have never fought as a team or in combination (e.g. Kushina and Minato/ Konohamaru and Iruka etc.)\n- Old Characters still have outdated movesets (e.g. Kiba still has 3 headed Cerburus missing from his moveset, They still have the same UJ's from storm 2)\n- Changing the game mechanics where you have to choose between Awakening and Ultimate jutsu mode is a downgrade IMO.\n\nNeutral:\n- I generally didn't care about the Ninja escapades - because the stories and characters involved don't appeal to me.\n\nOther Improvements:\n- Only Team 7 and female characters seem to get fanservice dlc costumes......I really want to see new Kiba costumes (for example)\n\nOverall I would rate the game a 4.5/10....If you've played the previous installments, I wouldn't recommend getting this. But If this is your first storm game then it would be more intriguing for our first play","November 18, 2015","false","66.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

My biggest qualms are that they removed Jutsu clashes (yes, I'm one of those peole) and that the four player mode is... well, single player. And, in all honesty, it's not very fun; it largely comprises of getting the most hits in a round instead of taking out each opponent one by one, which, in a local party match, would be a good way to keep all the players playing throgh to the end. But again: it's single player. The design decision is really pointless, and it basically composes the entire NInja World Tournament. Not to mention that the free roaming island it takes place on is giant and lifeless.\n\nI think the announcer dialogue is probably the worst option. Not so much that it exists, just that it's terrible and doesn't actually react to anything that's happening. My personal favorite: "I see. The strategy is to finish this quickly." Over and over again.\n\nThe character roster is definitely formidable, with costume options for all of them, at least. Plus, the core fighting gameplay is pretty much as good as ever (minus the clashes).","May 3","false","8.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

So if your only knowledge before buying this game is everything steam presents you on the store page, then you're being lied to. The video and the screenshots show you the progression of the story (like, literally the next events to come along in the series); but all you get is the same fighting system from Full Burst 3 mixed with a tournament gimmick.\n\nThe Good Bits:\n-The fighting in the game is really fun.\n-You can play with up to 4 players\n-There are lots of characters.\n-You can experience small story bits like "The Creation of the Akutski"\n\nThe Bad Bits:\n-The fighting is fun, but that's because it's the SAME THING FROM FULL BURST 3!\n-The slight changes they've made to the fighting system have made it worse than Full Burst 3. Instead of having full access to all of your abilities, they're split amongst the "Drive System". (i.e. With Neji, in full burst 3 you could activate Byakugan at the cost of your chakra gauge draining. In Revolution you have to choose a drive system meaning, either you get to have your Kekkei Genkai or your ultimate attack). This a huge downgrade from the previous game, and there's NOTHING positive to gain from this change.\n-On Steam the game is shamelessly sold under the false impression that you're continuing the story. There's nothing stating that it's just a fighting game with a tournament mode and little else to it; but the video footage and screenshots sell you on the image of what clearly happens next in the storyline.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nDon't waste your time getting Revolution. If you don't have Full Burst 3 then I would highly recommend getting that and forgetting that this game even exist.\nIf you have Full Burst 3 then don't waste $50 on this game unless:\n1) You have $50 that you're just dying to waste on something, instead of using it for something useful or helpful for someone else.\n2) You and a lot of friends play Naruto games a lot. This one is up to 4 players unlike Full Burst 3; and this is the ONLY bright side to this game.","December 29, 2014","false","6.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You get three different arcs, one which is very short (Obito and Kushina). However, the other two were well thought out in terms of story and gameplay alike. Anime omitted the parts, but ties in nicely with it! I am yet to try out Mecha Naruto!\n\n\nPROS:\n- Ultimate Jutsu, Awakening and Drive Modes; definitely spice up the variety\n- New characters\n- Clever way to unlock new characters\n- Survival Mode seems to be better than in Storm 3 (FullBurst)\n- Different Ultimates, depending on whom you team up with\n- Different cutscenes, depending on the opponent\n- Ninja World Tournament looks promising so far\n\nCONS:\n- Lacking story mode, compared to Storm 3\n\n\nHowever, at the time of writing this, I am yet to unlock all the characters, finish off rest of the Survival challanges, and try the Online Mode, hence the short review.\n\nEDIT1: Finished all the Survival Modes, unlocking all the characters in the process. Quite pleased with the amount of available characters.","December 29, 2014","true","8.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

So if your only knowledge before buying this game is everything steam presents you on the store page, then you're being lied to. The video and the screenshots show you the progression of the story (like, literally the next events to come along in the series); but all you get is the same fighting system from Full Burst 3 mixed with a tournament gimmick.\n\nThe Good Bits:\n-The fighting in the game is really fun.\n-You can play with up to 4 players\n-There are lots of characters.\n-You can experience small story bits like "The Creation of the Akutski"\n\nThe Bad Bits:\n-The fighting is fun, but that's because it's the SAME THING FROM FULL BURST 3!\n-The slight changes they've made to the fighting system have made it worse than Full Burst 3. Instead of having full access to all of your abilities, they're split amongst the "Drive System". (i.e. With Neji, in full burst 3 you could activate Byakugan at the cost of your chakra gauge draining. In Revolution you have to choose a drive system meaning, either you get to have your Kekkei Genkai or your ultimate attack). This a huge downgrade from the previous game, and there's NOTHING positive to gain from this change.\n-On Steam the game is shamelessly sold under the false impression that you're continuing the story. There's nothing stating that it's just a fighting game with a tournament mode and little else to it; but the video footage and screenshots sell you on the image of what clearly happens next in the storyline.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nDon't waste your time getting Revolution. If you don't have Full Burst 3 then I would highly recommend getting that and forgetting that this game even exist.\nIf you have Full Burst 3 then don't waste $50 on this game unless:\n1) You have $50 that you're just dying to waste on something, instead of using it for something useful or helpful for someone else.\n2) You and a lot of friends play Naruto games a lot. This one is up to 4 players unlike Full Burst 3; and this is the ONLY bright side to this game.","December 29, 2014","false","6.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

My favorite was Storm 3 by far and I had VERY high expectations for this game. So far I have about 2 hours in and I tried every type of gameplay. The world tournament seems EXTREMELY bland, the "story mode" for the akatsuki was extremely repetative. (Oh go here. Confront them. They deny it. Fight. You overwhelmingly win. They join from their own interests.).\n\nAll said and done the new features in this game are nothing to look at. Now getting down to the core gameplay most people end up playing which is free battles of all types. You're going to get what you expect which is a traditional Ultimate Ninja game, but the ultimate justus seem VERY anti-climatic and dry. Using a character like Pain and having such a mediocre jutsu is a laugh. I do think you can unlock more through playing parts of the game though, have yet to get to those parts.\n\nOverall, disappointed with my experience so far, but I'm not giving up in the game. As a fan of Naruto it takes a lot to really through me off for a game and there's still fun to be had here. Just don't go into this game expecting the AWESOMELY cinematic story more experience and thrilling free-battles we got out of Storm 3.","September 16, 2014","true","3.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

From what ive played and felt that this was a rushed crossover\nfrom the xbox version and the creators couldnt care less about the game in the PC form. I tried to change the key bindings and its very limited only pre binded keys could be rebinded. I like Naruto and I'd gladly support them but when the game creators put the name on the game and make it look bad. So for the people that are like just go buy a controller and stop complaining, well i say im playing on a PC and expect a PC game to not force me to buy a controller and adapter for 80$ after i spent 50$ already on the game (just kidding i spent 12.49$ lol at anyone that pays full price) to play it to its full potential.","September 10, 2015","false","0.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","2"

Well i never had a problem with it, never crashed, never had a single problem with it. and i played a lot of it offline with no MP.\n\nwhen i tryed the online, it is dead, but that is to be expected of fighting games now days, unless it a massive fighter game like tekkin or super smash you have to expect it will be dead at least 2 weeks after launch. as is the fate if the last Storm, and DBZ games....\n\nSo this is where i start to get negitive:\nwhen i bought this game i assumed that it was going to be like genirations, where it went back in time and then bought us back up to speed with what was going on, and a little extra. It was pritty obvious that it wasent going to be a hard core story line game like full burst ( and even that only added on).....\n\nBUT NEVER DID I THINK IT WAS GOING TO BE THIS CRAP!!!!\n*the campain has NOTHING to do with the storyline, rather your on a tordament island where you rank up, and guess what? you do the same thing AGAIN from d rank to s+\n\n*There is how ever a mecha naruto campain which is a story line to its self with no actual tie in to the main story line\n\n* this is a another mode that has three 15 min mini game which is the only part that was linked to the story line which to be fank if you wanna see them, go to youtube, its not worth the money...\n\n*the new game mode pits you and 3 others agaisnt each other to collect orbs, which is boring as well and locks you out of the cool attacks  unless you get a orb that give you the ability then who ever get hit with it gets heavly damaged... so its like having a fight with one leg cut off, sure everyone has there leg cut off, but if you where watching it real life, it would just be a dumb ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fight.\n\nSure it has way more characters and dont get me wrong, i do enjoy it when im playing the normal 1v1 modes with mates, but if your thinking of taking the fight online with like listed above, is useless...\n\nI am quite disappointed with this game as a whole and even as a fan of the storm games i would sugest getting naruto full blast, sure its older, less characters and probaly less chance of a online fight BUT\n*its cheaper\n* it has a storyline worth a fue good hours\n*i personaly enjoyed it better than this one\n\nBut i can only give you a insite as to what i have played :D\n\n\n","November 22, 2014","false","2.3"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

If your familar with any of the DBZ budakai series then you can easily play this game and beat it, no sweat.\n\nSOO MANY LOADING SCREENS... Porting to PC, you should at least take into the account there's more RAM than a console.\n\nCrashes occasionally when trying to make character selections.\n\nTries to extend gameplay time by having slow travel times between areas. If there wasn't any loading/traveling you could probably beat this game in one sitting.\n\nI'm not against OpenGL but DirectX has come along way...\n\nEach character has 2 unique Ninjutsu moves and about 4 different combos and 1 unique grab. Some of them have unique support with Ultimate Ninjutsu. That said, the characters only favor either being direct or indirect aka range.\n\nSmall reasons you might want to have this game:\nIt offers local multiplayer. (Only up to two!) Online is 4 players.\nIt features your favorite characters from the series (almost all of them.)\n\nYou do need a controller for a better experience.","December 9, 2014","false","34.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

There's a LOT of characters to play from either Season 1 or Season 2 (shippuden). Nice combos, great music, and even new stuff like fusing your supporting character's ultimate into your main character's ultimate aka a teamwork based finale ultimate. There's even animated cut scenes made by the people who work on the anime themselves, and it goes into the past based on Akatsuki to Obito's childhood. Was great seeing those clips.\n\nBut ....\n\nThe game falls flat on story mode. You only get three of them which are very short. Then you have the World Championship which involves you hitting your opponents to collect the most orbs. It's kind of pointless and lame to be honest. Online mode has hardly anyone really playing, let alone doing ranking mode, to leaderboard mode. I have great connection but still had difficulty finding anyone to fight against. The rest of the game is lacking on terms of game modes against AI's along the fact there's not much else to it. For a fighting game, it feels it could of been more. I still enjoyed it, yet... overall, it could of been better apart from the mechanics being improved and great cutscenes done in the anime fashion like the show.

The naruto storm series from generations >> onwards shouldn't be overlooked or slept on because of percieved "gimmicky" combat centered around ninja movement and it's yearly releases.  The very mechanic of ninja movement/dashing contributes strongly to a solid fighting metagame centered around good spacing, timing, reading, baiting, bar observation etc.\n\n\nKeep in mind, as a yearly release this is a "filler" game. There is no story mode to be found here, this is made by a team of 170 otaku japs who're paid to produce this yearly; they create filler games like this and Generations in order to test new mechanics and smooth things out for the main releases. On that note, I have high hopes for storm 4 which will likely be worth buying as a naruto fan simply for the story mode gameplay just as Storm 3 was.\n\nThis game is very enjoyable when learned and played with narutofriends irl. However, for this game in particular, if you're going to be playing online only you'll have a bad time due to sub-par servers and a lack of people playing with half-decent connections anymore. Because of this and a lack of story mode, I can't reccomend Revolution.\n\nFor fans of the series, I would say Storm 2 and 3 are worth purchasing for the story as the cel-shaded animation is superb. The boss fights manage to capture the feel of the manga while, in my opinion, outdoing much of what studio Pierrot does in the anime.\n\nAnd something I feel needed to be addressed about this series for fighting fan critics, a defense of the combos: "There's only 3 combos for each character" is a very poor excuse to overlook this game as a fighter if you really enjoy them. Don't knock it before you try it, and I would reccomend looking at some of the higher-tier online gameplay videos to get a feel for how this can really be played. The 3-combo-system is also all centered around set up. Hit him onto the ground to keep him close, knock him back to gain some distance, throw him into the air to make him vulnerable. It's all about the movement.\nAlso, many of the combos have some very tricky things throughout them.\nFor example, some characters throw ranged weapons at specific points in their combo which can then be used to catch your opponent and rush in for a combo. In addition, each of those combos have particular moments within the moves which can be interrupted by "rushing" in at the intervals which may then be counter-countered by your opponent if they read your rush correctly.\n\nIf you're really that critical, I would even reccomend simply pirating this game and playing it on single matches and then teams with a friend. You will more than likely start to see what you're missing.","June 23, 2015","false","98.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","1","4","0","0"

The gameplay is easy to learn and hard to pick up.\nOne negative aspect of the game is that its unbalanced at times but its natural with such a huge roster that certain character might seem op.\nOther then that i prsonally have no complains.

The amount of playable characters adds a significant amount of options to create your own team. The new storm gauge works well with the feel of the game. The choice between Ultimate Jutsu, Awakening, and Drive types are immense. You can play one character on a certain type for a while and then play them on another and it can be a night and day difference. Overall great game, and as long as you adjust for the glitch (you can find the solution on the steam forums) you will have a great time playing it.","September 23, 2014","true","26.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/naioni/recommended/272510/","naioni","Who's that Pokémon?! - NaiOni","http://steamcommunity.com/id/naioni/","630 products in account","While I generally recommend this game, I will ask you to take caution; this game does not run well on all PC's, and I am not talking about weaker machines. When I bought this game, I had the same problems I had with Ninja Storm 3 after I upgraded from my old Radeon HD 6950 1GB to a Radeon R9 290 4GB. From what I've gathered, these games do not run well on GPU's with a clockspeed that is too high, and will then run at a framerate as low as 20 FPS at worst. When in a fight, it will vary from 25-30 FPS. This not only means stuttering animation, but a lowered game speed as well, because the game speed is bound to the framerate, as is common practice in fighting games. I recommend this game to anyone with a slightly weaker system. If you DO have a stronger system, and decide to buy the game regardless, there are programs that can fix the problems. If you google "ninja storm revolution framerate" you'll find steam threads that can help you, although some of the instructions leave out some vital parts, so keep reading further in the threads.","October 10, 2014","true","11.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

There is a massive array of characters available to use. There is no "real" story mode, just the Ninja Tournament and the Ninja Escapades. The multiplayer makes up for the lack of a story. I am not going to say that the Multiplayer is 100% awesome, at all. In-fact I'd say that it needs some work. The number one thing that needs to be fixed is the counter-system. It's far to overpowered at the moment. One should be able to sub from an Ultimate Jutsu when Counter-broken, it's quite unfair to cheaply UJ someone who is guard broken. On the note of the counter system, the guard break pill has to be taken out as-well. You cannot (usually) sub from an UJ during a guard break with the pill. Other than this and the try-hard/fail/cheap community, the game is pretty good. Stick to player matches, and for those who are wondering, Yes, I do twitch gameplay of ranked a lot of the time.

It's not quite as friendly to 'pick-up' and learn though, due to the introduction of several new mechanics. Unless you become very good at mastering the new mechanics, you most likely will not enjoy higher level play in this game.\n\nAs it goes for many things, who you play with really makes (or breaks) the game.\n\nThe long:\n\nBecause I have a lot of complaints about this game I will get the positives out of the way first.\n\nThe graphics are crisp and fresh. The new moves and characters really help boost the 'new feel' to the game, even if it's more like UNS 3.5 instead of UNS4. The combos and Ultimate Jutsus are flashier than ever, and the new combo Ultimate system really helps immerse you into the game as the teams go. Because of the new Type-Select system, a lot of the characters which were flat-out bad in Full Burst are now more or less playable and have viable strategies.\n\nNow for my complaints.\n\nRevolution feels like a good game at heart, it seems like it was trying to fix a lot of stuff that was not broken with the last game (Full Burst).  The Type-Select system is a cool novelty, but most of the time I was just wishing they balanced out the Awakenings and Ultimates of all the characters instead of basically resorting to "they're all going to be overpowered, so you only get one".\n\nCertain characters lend themselves to certain modes, which is okay, but many previous versions of characters are just outright weaker than the new versions, which makes their usefulness questionable.\n\nThe higher level play has degraded in 'funness' too I feel, as the introduction to the new Parry system allows the player to dizzy his opponent instanteously by guarding and hitting the shuriken button against any basic action (air dash, chakra dash, punch). The 'fear' of being parried has deadlocked many of the matches I have been in into double jumping jutsu spamming fests, and it really takes a large emphasis out of the combos and offensive play of the online.\n\nThis is probably the biggest problem I have with the game, even more or so than some of the new Awakenings they added in. I have never been a fan of turtling in Full Burst but it somehow feels much, much worse in this game. It just my opinion, but if you are used to playing very aggressively from previous Naruto games, you WILL have to change your strategies or you will be watching four or five Ultimate Jutsu cutscenes per match.\n\nI think Full Burst is a superior game as far as fun factor goes, but I would still recommand this game as hardly anyone plays the former games online.

It's even in the title.  NARUTO SHIPPUDEN: Ultimate Ninja (STORM Revolution) there is no number entitling it to anything so every can stop complaining about there not being alot to it and not having a story. This is worth buying if you liked Naruto3FullBurst. it doesnt contain much more than the previous game but a few new characters and gametypes and settings. but the biggest thing about this game is all the previous problems from the last were fixed and the netcode has been improved enough for stable online play.","September 16, 2014","true","30.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

What I mean by that is that there is no canon story presented like in Storm 3, but a ton of updated characters to play and experiment with and a new 4 way combat mode to tackle.\n\nPros:\nA lot of characters to play with\nMecha-Naruto Story feels like a decent filler arc of the anime\nSide stories to play through complete with animated cutscenes\nJoint ultimate jutsu!\nCons:\nWorld Tournament mode is a bit repetitive\nNo fantastic boss battles like in Storm 3\nI don't play online so I cannot comment on that game mode.\n\nA main addition is 4 way combat. It's hard to fall one way or another with this mode. It is very fun to have a lot of hectic action on screen at once. However, it can sometimes get too hectic, and with a lacking targetting system you may be taking more hits than you really should.\n\nThe Mecha-Naruto story is a fun little story to enjoy. It's not the greatest story you'll ever play but it is enjoyable to play through an entirely new story that isn't presented in the manga or anime. It definitely doesn't hold the game up on it's own but it's a good additional mode.\n\nIf you're a fan of the Naruto series, you will find a lot of fantastic fanservice in this game mainly to excite you for the next Storm game. Admittedly, it's also missable if you're not too interested in trying new characters or the new combat system. If you're not a fan, it'll be hard to buy into the series with this title. You're better off starting with Storm 2 (not on PC) or Storm 3.","September 17, 2014","true","20.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Why? Because of the absolute lack of plot within the game. The 4-way battle sytem has grown on me, rahter because its provides a minor change of pace from constant battling. Overall the battle mechanics are great, though I would have prefered that characters had access to all battle forms as in the previous game, not just, jutsu, drive or awakening.

When I bought this game, I had the same problems I had with Ninja Storm 3 after I upgraded from my old Radeon HD 6950 1GB to a Radeon R9 290 4GB. From what I've gathered, these games do not run well on GPU's with a clockspeed that is too high, and will then run at a framerate as low as 20 FPS at worst. When in a fight, it will vary from 25-30 FPS. This not only means stuttering animation, but a lowered game speed as well, because the game speed is bound to the framerate, as is common practice in fighting games. I recommend this game to anyone with a slightly weaker system. If you DO have a stronger system, and decide to buy the game regardless, there are programs that can fix the problems. If you google "ninja storm revolution framerate" you'll find steam threads that can help you, although some of the instructions leave out some vital parts, so keep reading further in the threads.","October 10, 2014","true","11.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

There is a massive array of characters available to use. There is no "real" story mode, just the Ninja Tournament and the Ninja Escapades. The multiplayer makes up for the lack of a story. I am not going to say that the Multiplayer is 100% awesome, at all. In-fact I'd say that it needs some work. The number one thing that needs to be fixed is the counter-system. It's far to overpowered at the moment. One should be able to sub from an Ultimate Jutsu when Counter-broken, it's quite unfair to cheaply UJ someone who is guard broken. On the note of the counter system, the guard break pill has to be taken out as-well. You cannot (usually) sub from an UJ during a guard break with the pill. Other than this and the try-hard/fail/cheap community, the game is pretty good. Stick to player matches, and for those who are wondering, Yes, I do twitch gameplay of ranked a lot of the time.

This next game in the franchise is going to have all of that ramped up to the max and a ton of new features to set it apart. The previous game was highly modded and this game should end up the same in the end adding many more hours to the hundreds that you will be putting in after picking up this epic game. And with the multilayer mode and many different characters to chose from it is a great game for even people who are not fans of the series, but be warned after playing this game you will be! This game will be taking place around the current Naruto Shippuden subbed episodes and into the manga chapters directly following, so try to skip the cut scenes if you are not far enough in the series yet to avoid spoilers, and many of the battles in the game are from the series but they often will add or take out battles from the series to better fit the game, nothing bad enough to ruin the story for the people who already have scene it but enough to avoid to many major spoilers for new comers. If you wish to start watching or reading now hear are links to the start of the three viewing forms of Naruto.\nDubbed: http://www1.narutospot.net/watch/naruto-1-dubbed/\nSubbed: http://www1.narutospot.net/watch/naruto-1/\nManga: http://www.mangapanda.com/93-1-1/naruto/chapter-1.html\nBut if you want you can start here without any real problems with the story because most of it is explained and most the series is not directly affected by the original but I highly recommend starting from the originals to get the full story, but again none of this is kneaded to play the games an still have a lot of fun while your doing it.\nDubbed: http://www1.narutospot.net/watch/naruto-shippuden-1-dubbed/\nSubbed: http://www1.narutospot.net/watch/naruto-shippuden-1/\nManga: http://www.mangapanda.com/93-250-1/naruto/chapter-245.html\nAll of this is ongoing with the manga about one hundred episodes in chapters longer than the Subbed and subbed about one hundred episodes longer than the dubbed. I have done all three and the only difference between subbed and dubbed content is length but both shows have fillers in them that the manga does not have but are still considered cannon, much like some of the content that will be in this game in the form of flashbacks and other cut scenes. And all of this is still ongoing but saddle the manga is going to end sometime late 2014,leaving the amine to catchup but still giving us marginal content with fillers and there is also a movie and other content coming out not based solely of the manga.","September 16, 2014","true","23.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

In one breath it is great but in the next breath it is a generations more then storm 4. there is no clear and concise sotry mode like in storm 3 and free battle is pretty much the game. It is still fun and a fresh expierience but you have to realize what your getting into instead of getting your hopes up. The new characters are fun and cool but it is defintely different from what i thought it would be. So please investigate and realize how the game works because it is not your normal storm game. They didnt call it revolution for nothing...\n\n\nI have played alot more hours now and i have truly expierienced more of this game. IT SUCKS!!! By far one of the worst naruto games out there. Majority of characters are copy and pasted with a few exceptions but it gets old. Online is only lag not even playable. The idea of orbs is so stupid and their are glitches in it which really ♥♥♥♥ me off. Plus theirs no story the tournament is the same thing over and over with just harder computers ganging up on you. Escalades again are like 30 minutes long so their is nothing to do. So repetative and nothing new exciting or unique. I also doubt multiplayer will be fixed so needless to say thats a lost cause. I highly recommend either not buying this or get it on console. Buy it used from gamestop beat it in a week and return it once beaten.

I say this game evens itself out. World Tournament mode is a thrill, and the Ninja Escapades which is basiclly story mode is entertaining... With a few fights in The Akatsuki Story, two fights in Shisui, and NONE in Obito's which I think is kind of lame. They do offer Free Battle mode, Online Mode, and World Tournament mode outside of the Ninja Escapdes mode though. World Tournament is a four man/woman battle. You start at D rank mode, and work your way up. First match is free for all, and after that you have to hunt down a partner on the tournament island to help you.\n\nedit add: So I just wanted to add I played 15 hours now, and found you can get mecha Naruto story if you beat world tournament the first time, and its highly worth it to seek out accessories if possible. You can make some pretty epic looks. In Free battles you can do League, and Survival mode. There is also a special type system ultimate, Drive, and awakening. Awakening allows for constant awakenings, Ultimate allows use of ultimate, and Drive makes you more interactive with allies, and they often protect you from ultimates. Bringing together allies on your team creates different effects. Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura will get you the three way summon. So basiclly its based on who is on your team that makes the special and yes these specials replace your ultimate jutsu. So becareful cause your characters REAL ultimate might be better.\n\nIts got a good set up so far, and for those of you who are looking for a keyboard layout here is something just for you!\nStart: Enter\nBack: Right shift\nY: A\nA: Space\nX: Z\nB: X\nLeft stick click: X\nRight stick click: right control\nLeft back: Q\nRight Back: E\nLeft trigger: W\nRight Trigger S\nLeft stick up: up\nLeft stick down: down\nLeft stick left: left\nLeft stick right: right\nRight stick up: T\nRight stick down: G\nRight stick left: F\nRight stick right: H\nDpad up: I\nDpad down: k\nDpad left: j\nDpad right: L\n\nIt works for me, and may be abit confusing, but basiclly it will work like...\nQ, and E for summoning partners\nW for sub jutsu\nS for blocking\nA for chakra\nD for melee\nZ for throwing Shuriken\nI,J,K,L are your items\nF,T,G,H, are your changing target in world tournament moment, or simply turning the camera.\nOh and I forget to mention the space bar becomes your jump button.\n\nEnjoy this amazing game!","September 15, 2014","true","29.7"," 7 of 17 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","7","17","0","0"

The added 'special stories' are actually pretty interesting, and I really enjoy the replay value with the tournament mode- In fact, I'll probably be playing for quite a while.\nIf I had a criticism though, like most others posting reviews, is that this is truely not a sequel as we've come to understand the word as- yes, it has many charecters that came out after Ultimate Ninja Storm 3, and Full Burst, but as many are saying, this really just feels like a DLC. For starters, there is no story mode- which, until today, I was lead to believe that there, in fact, would be. I was slightly dissapointed in that fact. For instance, if you bought this game alone and none of the other most recent releases, you'd be missing out on playing the story mode, which I know many people playing this game look foreward too.\nHOWEVER! This review is a recommendation, and not a negative comment. WHILE some of those key elements are missing, this game is still more fun than it's predecesors in gameplay and combat mechanics. The new formation modes are a fresh take on the traditional 'use the biggest jutsu first' situations- in fact, there's a formation that will cancel out those huge jutsu's! Beyond that, the animations are visually stunning as always, and the huge charecter roster is quite impressive. Besides, I've already heard that they were going to add more, of course in DLC's, but I in fact will buy them. While it's not the game I was looking for, I will play it eagerly- I preordered it 5 weeks ago damnit, and I'm not gonna stop playing because it's not what I was expecting, especially if it's still fun and enjoyable!

Well... I'm not thrilled about the game itself.\n\nI paid about $45 - $50 (pre-order) and when it was released and had it installed on my laptop, I was disappointed by not only the difficulty of the game, but also the near inability to play it on a PC. It became clear to me that this game was meant for platforms and not a PC as the controls were straight from an XBox game pad complete with triggers and bumpers and finding the right keyboard strokes to play the game effectively proved trying and ultimately nonexistent.\n\nThis should have been re-worked to be of use to those that wanted to play the game on their laptop.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kenuty/recommended/272510/","kenuty","Kenuty","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kenuty/","1340 products in account","Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja storm revolution is a much more improved version of its predecessor in the mechanics, Taking out the parts of the game that was unnecessary such as that hack and slash gameplay and putting in more emphasis on fighting, online play and balance of the game, while suffering problems with a lag at times. However, the game sacrificed most of its epic music, story, and cut scenes(except the mecha naruto storyline which has all this) features drawing fans right down the middle. Those who are looking for a game with new mechanics, more balanced system this is what this game is about. For those that wanted a story mode, it's better off to get fullburst. Both games, however, still seem to suffer from network problems though you are likely to get better connectivity in this one.\n\nDuring the start of the game players will be able to browse four modes - Online battles, Ninja's world tournament, free battle, and ninja escapades.\n\nThe story mode of the game is ninja escapades. To understand the story of the game players will have to play the previous version full burst, read the manga, watch the anime or look for various resources to know exactly what is going on in the series itself otherwise, prepare to be dumbfounded in this series. The game has a seriously short story mode which had its story nicely picked and exclusive. However, can be beaten in 1 hour and 30 minutes making truly short and a letdown. However there is also a Mecha Naruto sidestory in the ninja tournament mode which seems to be the main story line in the game. Previous fan looking for more of the story that is canon will be disappointed to find there is almost none in this version of the game and gone are those epic sequences and music like in fullburst.\n\nThe ninja tournament mode is a single player vs three other CPU controlled characters in a free-for-all where the fight is a brawl type to knock each other and earn orbs to progress through a tournament ladder to obtain tons of unlockables such as costumes items, jutsus, ultimate jutsus, items, and cards.\nPlayers will also be able to send out network clones and have it level up toearn items and xp along with battling other network clones that appear. The mode itself has nothing to do with the story on the anime but is filled with roaming gameplay, voiced mini events, lotteries, sub quests to unlock characters, mini games, and secrets to be found through orbs.\nAfter winning the first ninja tournament mode the Mecha Naruto side story will open for a small adventure with a plot. As you progress in the ninja world tournaments more of the world opens up for more to explore and unlock.\n\nFree for all is a mode to test and play with what is wanted so that new players can understand the combos and characters to find, which is the best combos for them along with getting the mechanics of the game down. There are 118 characters to choose from to mix and match along with one or two supports to choose from for each setup.\n\nOnline play also has an assortment of new options to choose from such as ranked, private matches, endless mode and ninja war mode are to name a few. Though the game is played through the network by who hosts and can sometimes be laggy making it truly hard to pull off some counterattacks and guard break if this happens, afterwards it just becomes a spam fest between who can hit what and to predict the future as moves are inputted 5-10 seconds later. If there is a good connection, then it gets really fun. The multiplayer seems to be much better in matching player's skill levels and latency but there is still the problem with lag and transmission EVERY TIME NOW.\n\nThe game itself, however, had its mechanics improved and that was the highlight here. The support system is reworked and evened out, There is a guard break mechanic in place along with a guard break item, and with a counterattack move to really change things up and help solved some of its imbalance. Before a fight players are able to pick from three different style type, UAD, (ultimate jutsu, awakening, or drive type) where the game lets players concentrate on one of the three aspects in the fight.\nThe game fighting is often more smooth on the inputs, and the game feels considerably more refined when played. This game is very easy to play and understand on the mechanics but very hard to master and takes some real skills when it comes to fighting others of different styles. Players will have to experiment with many combos to find the one that fits their style or the best ones. So yes, spammers and such can be beaten. The game was created to be fun to play and not really something to be taken too seriously as it is a game created for fun for anyone of all ages.\n\n\nIf you are a die-hard Naruto fan, this is a must-have for you, though if you are looking for the previous story mode that full burst offered you will not see that in this one because again it is focused upon the fighting mechanics, unlockables and online play(which is lagging nonstop). Otherwise wait for the price drop to make the purchase.\n\n+ Graphics and moves are deeply flashy like the anime and felt truly cool to pull off.\n+ Refined fighting mechanic that is easy to learn includes guard break and counterattack to help balance out the problems but very hard to master using these since they are about timing.\n+ Includes Japanese language choice\n+ has a world tournament mode to unlock items in and do special mini games for the collectionist\n+ Fighting feels a lot more refined and fluid\n+118 characters and two different support with a great amount of combination to create\n+ Lots of unlockables, character aesthetic customization and secrets to unlock in the various modes.\n+ Easy to learn, Fun to play, but hard to master. Not to be taken too seriously\n+Mecha naruto story mode is different.\n\n- No hands on tutorial for new players, but you can read from the menu and learn it since its easy.\n- Ninja escapades story is short 1 hour and 30 mins, the mecha naruto seems to be longer.\n- Network play depends on who is hosting, can be laggy at times well, most of the time its a lagfest and really unenjoyable because of this if you are matched with low pinged players OR maybe its the net code not sure but holy lag.\n- If you get matched up with a pro, you're 90% guaranteed death lol unless you get lucky somehow\n- For the price of 49.99, you'll have to be die hard, because this one is focused upon the fighting mechanics' online play, unlocks and ninja world mode. There isn't much to story mode this time around.\n- The epic scores and events aren't in this version (Mecha naruto end battle was the only part)\n- If you are coming into this game thinking its a serious and very competitive game, then you got it wrong.\n- The lag is now unbearable online and a real turn off, as if every player is lagging I can turn on injustice or ssf4 fine without atrocious transmission or lag against other players.\n\nreview on twitch.tv/kenuty","September 23, 2014","true","40.4"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","36"

It has been rehashed to the extreme. All of the spam characters have been nerfed and the game just plays better online altogether. Try and spam awakening, the other guy can spam ultimates or supports. There's a counter for every type of spammer.\n\nThe ninja world tournament. It's stupid, it uses the over-the-head battle royale thing that was in storm 3, i hated that garbage waste of time. Escapades? Also stupid, just watch the videos on youtube, not worth paying $40-50 for something you can watch for free.\n\nThere are like 5 new characters, but once again for $50, haha, no. The online lags over 9000, its horrible. If your playing with friends down the stree it works fine. But try playing with someoen in another country i dare you. It's worse than storm 3. In storm 3, the game would freeze with transmitting on your screen. this game chooses to not do that, but just give you input lag instead, which is worse because your online looking like a dumb ♥♥♥ who doesnt know what he's doing because your subsitution is a whole second late.\n\nI can say, once again the onine is VERY balanced, WAAY better than storm 3, if you can get it to work. I'm already bored of this game. Storm 3 is basically just free battle with more characters. It's storm 3 DLC worth $5. So unless you don't own Storm 3 already, don't buy this garbage.\nBut me being the die hard fan of Naruto that i am, I don't regret buying this game one cent. I kind of got what i expected to, minus the crap online mode. So maybe if your a fan you'll buy the game, but if you didn't care enough to preorder it, than it's probably because you were skeptical. Your skepticism was well placed,as this game is worthless. :)","September 17, 2014","false","229.2"," 9 of 22 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","9","22","0","2"

(looks like all stories were told, only filling the gaps?)\nCompared to last gen, this game is more like a DLC in my opinion...\nYou might say the tournament mode 4 ninja brawl is so darn nice, but it's just not for me.\nToo much walking and talking cliche in tournament mode tho.\nAs a said above, I guess $49USD ($69AUD) might be a little bit overpriced? Think about other fighting games :)\n\nPros:\nThe battle scene in this gen is a lot BETTER.\nWith 100 playable & support characters, there are sure to be characters to fit everyone's play style.\nNew gameplay mechanics with the powerful combo ultimate jutsu and combined attacks, allowing characters to combine their power to create powerful techniques to defeat the enemies.\nA brand new character (Mecha-Naruto) designed by Masashi Kishimoto exclusively for the game.\nNew ninja world tournament mode featuring 4 ninjas brawl and one gathering the most battle orbs wins.\n\nConclusion:\nIf you are only into the fighting part of the game, I would defintely recommend you to pick this one up!\nBut, if you are a person like me focus more on the story mode, you might be disappointed ;'(\n\n\nP.S.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/blazeholiday/recommended/272510/","blazeholiday","BlazeHoliday","http://steamcommunity.com/id/blazeholiday/","139 products in account","Pros: The best in the series as far as combat and character selection goes. More characters then previously avaliable in any storm title. Both faces from the past and present are in Revolution. Ninja World Tournament has a nice presentation to it. It's your only real chance to experience a little open world in this game. Take any of the characters from the roster and compete in 4 fighter battle-royale going from rank D to rank S competition building your own story a long the way.\n\nCons: There is not real story mode here. Generations 2.0 is pretty much what you get. There are a few side/back stories, also the  Mech-Naruto fantasy story that are basically your equivalent to filler episodes. So don't expect to see the grand finale of the Fourth Great Ninja War in this title. Outside of it's lack of story this game has no outstanding flaws.\n\nRating: 8.5/10\nFinal Thoughts: If Storm 4 comes and the game is exactly the way it is here in Revolution but with a story mode you got a 10/10 for Naruto and anime lovers a like. I give it an 8.5 due to the fact that it's a filler in disguise, but we all knew that coming in. Fans of the series won't be disappointed. Lets just hope Storm 4 hits early next year or heck even this holiday season would be epic!","September 17, 2014","true","19.4"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

This is not a bad game, and I say that with honesty. This game is a testamony to laziness, slacking on the devs side, its not innovative, and worst of all it's a cash grab. I would not pay full price for this game if I were you. If you want this game rent it or whatever, but don't buy it until it goes on steam sell or something.\n\nThe problem with this game is that it is full burst 3, but with some new characters, and anime cut scenes. There is basically no story in the game, and they try to sell you on this tournament which you will get bored of, and they also try to sell you on this robot naruto. This I guess is one of the selling points, but his story is EXTREMLY unintresitng, and I doubt anyone wanted a game just for a robot naruto anyway.\n\nAnother problem is this 100+ characters deal. They advertise this game and say we have over 100 playable people, but 6 of those guys are Sasuke, 4 or 5 are Naruto, 2 are the first hokage, 3 or Obito actually 4 is you count him as a child, and the list goes on. I really don't get it because they made 3 different Madaras one character. This is very lazy because I mean over half these characters were in full burst, and they had the exact same moves + special. Also I guess to be fun or balanced you have to choose to be in awaken mode or special mode, and I personally think they should be more of a choice and not either or. I get it is to balance the game, but it is a step back if I am playing as naruto and I can't do my special just because I can awaken or vice versa. I think they could have ismply made more complicated controls because well its a fighting game!\n\nIf you've played full burst 3 you have basically played this game, and there is your story. There is no ninja time line or anyhting, so save your money. There is no point to this game other then its a new naruto game, and I'm sure next year they will make a new one because the series has not even ended this year. Next year they will probably do it right and give you a story, real full characters, and leave this tournament stuff for an extra mode like free battle or something.\n\nThere is no story, there are too many copy cat characters, the ninja tournament gets boring FAST, and  mecha naruto is pretty uninteresting as a character and in his story.\n\nFinal line:Game is full burst 3 50 bucks add-n and out of 10 I'd give this game a 3.5 maybe 4, but 3.5.","September 16, 2014","false","19.2"," 4 of 13 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","4","13","0","0"

The game runs at 30fps, the stuttering from it is very noticable and displays a lack of effort on the development side. There are annoying slow camera movements in game, obvious copy and paste port with no improvements or even graphics settings.  The free roam is so lacking and limited to basic functionality.  The only enjoyment i got from this game was the hour long Ninja Endevours.  I could go on about the negatives and how its a cash cow.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kageyuuki/recommended/272510/","kageyuuki","KageYuuki","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kageyuuki/","56 products in account","I should probably preface this with the fact that this is the first Naruto fighting game I've bought since Clash of Ninja 2 for the Gamecube. I can safely say these games have certainly come a long way since then.\n\nStory:\nThe game has its own story that it follows; think filler episodes in the anime. There are two story modes in the game: the Ninja World Tournament's mecha Naruto, and the stories in Ninja Escapades. The cut scenes in Escapes were done in the same style as the show and sheds some light on a few areas not covered in the show or manga. I did find it to be a little too short, only taking a couple hours to get through. Though in the game's defense, there isn't much more new canon left that it could have followed and what there is will likely be for a later game.\n\nSound:\nBeing able to pick between English and Japanese versions for the voiceovers is a great option to have. Everyone has their own preference between the two version of the show. However, the music is probably the area I found myself being the most disappointed in. The soundtrack doesn't offer much in terms of variety; I was often just listening to the same few tracks over and over again. After a few hours of gameplay, I ended up just muting it and playing my own music.\n\nGameplay:\nWhat do you think of when you hear Ninja World Tournament? Chances are the last thing that comes to mind will trying to be the one with the most orbs collected when the time runs out. While the four person, free-for-all style battles that take place in this mode can be difficult, I felt they were wasted being only used for nabbing orbs. The combo system is another area that felt lacking. To pull off combos in the game you use the b button and, depending on the combo, tilt the control stick up or down once.\n\nOverall, I still found this a fun fighting game with a huge cast of characters to choose from. The different modes found under Free Battle help to add some variety and would certainly be fun to play against friends in. While the music certainly is disappointing, I wouldn't say it ruined the game. I recommend this if you're looking for a fan of Naruto and looking for a good way to kill some time.\n","October 5, 2014","true","19.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is basically as good as it gets! The combat is very flowing and challenging while at the same time being very flashy and rewarding in how intense the fighting feels (especially in the harder levels). The story-mode in this version isn't much to write home about but the game makes up for that fact with the huge character roster.\n\nThe game looks good, runs fairly well (your milage may vary but I haven't run into any issues or bugs during my ~30 hours of play) and is very fun to play if you have any love at all for the characters in Naruto.\n\nThis is a definite buy for Naruto fans but it's hard to recommend it to anything other than fans of the show.","December 28, 2014","true","29.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm a huge fan of its immediate predecessor, and even considering this is the newer game, I would pay MORE for Shippuden 3: Full Burst than I would for this game.\n\nThe story-related mode for the Akatsuki and Shisui was very very entertaining.. for the approximately 30 minutes it takes to beat it.\n\nMecha-Naruto, I would pay to have never seen that thing. I hated every minute of it, and cursed my completionist nature that I actually played it all the way through. Could have gone with a Sasori puppet, an Orochimaru bio-creation/clone, a Pain Nagato controlled body, but no, they went for a full arc of an android... in a canon that doesn't even feature cars outside of the movies... they went android. And this story is the LONGEST story segment in the game, BY FAR.\n\nThe four person tournaments are... okay. They're more of a mini-game than anything I'd actually want to be the focus of my tournament, and that's exactly what it is, the focus. Every level of the tournament is exactly the same. Even the voice-work of the announcers, at EVERY level is exactly the same. I was expecting at least some custom dialogue for beating the top level, even if not character-specific words. The only thing that changes at all is the mini-quests, and we all know how fun fetch quests are.\n\nAs per characters:\nI was a bit disappointed in Kushina's character, I was expecting her chain attacks and actual ninjutsu.. I got a frying pan.\nKonohamaru is fine, no complains there. I wouldn't say he's outstanding, but he's perfectly adequate.\nIruka, they did as much as they could with, he's not very well-developed as a fighter in the series, so fine enough there.\nShisui, great work, by far the best new character in the game, maybe overpowered even, but I can run with that.\nThe reanimated kage from Storm 3 are now playable... still not sure why they weren't in Storm 3. (Maybe this game really needed the leg up), they're mostly clones except for the Mizukage who has some very annoying attacks to go against.\n\nOther additions:\nI like the team setup of this game, especially having the unique finishers for a correct grouping of characters was really fun to explore and discover. Though there are several teams I'm really surprised have no special combos, it's still a great feature.\n\nThe online elements with sending out your bot to train is kind of cute, I liked that, but it's not really a huge draw that sets the game any higher either.\n\nOverall, this is MUCH more like a sequel to Naruto Ultimate Ninja Storm: Generations than it was a sequel to Storm 3. No epic boss fights, almost no story, straight out fighting and the 4 man minigame.\n\nFor context, I'd go:\nStorm 3: 96\nRevolution: 70\n\nI bought this game pre-release... won't be making that mistake again. If you're buying a Naruto game, buy Storm 3: Full Burst. Cannot too strongly emphasize that.","December 29, 2014","false","16.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The main guy, you know!\nSakura: She has pink hair.\nSai: Ladyman Number 1, needs more clothes.\nShikamaru: Why both his things look thesame and do the same stuff though?\nIno: Iunno about Ino.\nChoji: He reminds me of that one fat kid who gets ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off and throws a tantrum at everything.\nLee: See Shikamaru.\nNeji: He looks kinda like a cheesy martial arts movie character, which is pretty cool.\nTenten: See Neji.\nKiba: Kibas and bits! He uses a dog.\nShino: Somebody's DeviantArt OC.\nHinata: She t-talks like this... B-because she is the t-token anime girlfriend character! S-sorry~!\nKakashi: His hair is edgy.\nYamato: lol who?\nAsuma: lol who?\nGuy: Guy looks like Lee.\nTsunade: She has a cool name.\nJiraiya: I know who this guy is. Isn't he the pervert guy?\nYoung Kakashi: Young Kakashi\nYoung Obito: Anime Protagonist type character, just so you can try to feel bad when he turns evil.\nDanzo: He fights with one arm and one eye. You don't. Pansy.\nGaara: He is a sandbender~~\nKankuro: He controls 2 blowup puppets. More like KINKUROKILLMENOW\nTemari: She uses air from a fan as a weapon. That is badass.\nChiyo: Chiyo makes you cookies in her cozy little cottage.\nAy: Ayy lmao\nDarui: Proud, independent gay black man, who don't need no man.\nMifune: Alpha Patroklos.\nThe Fourth Kazekage: Uses gold dust as a weapon. Gold.\nMei: Sexualized lady character.\nOhnoki: A floating little yoda-type guy with a red pickle on his face for some reason.\nKiller Bee: He looks like Hulk Hogan and he "raps".\nZabuza: Somebody's DeviantArt OC, again.\nHaku: Haku kicks so much ♥♥♥ you wouldn't even believe. Also I like his name. Isn't he supposed to be a lady?\nSasuke: This is that guy all the teenage girls ship with Naruto or whatever.\nSuigetsu: Transgendered shark guy. I really don't know.\nKarin: No.\nJugo: JUGO SMAAAAAAASH!!!!\nMasked Man: Obito going through his "Sith" phase.\nItachi: Itachi is that character that shows how badass he is by doing nothing but stand there in a fight.\nKisame: He looks absolutely idiotic.\nKakuzu: Ms. Fortune's male counterpart. Except he IS motivated by personal gain. I think.\nHidan: Hidan is annoying as hell as a character but his ultimate looks cool.\nSasori: Ladyman Character #2. So sorry, Sasori.\nDeidara: A crazy ♥♥♥ artist hippie who fights using exploding clay. Also mouths on hands. ♥♥♥-kicker.\nTobi: obiTo\nKonan: Konan the Barbarian uses paper. Not quite as boring as it seems KARIIN.\nPain: Again, with a name like that, do you expect more than someone's edgy DA OC?\nShisui: A character obviously built to die. Not saying he's bad, but the way he acts. FEEL SAD!!\nOrochimaru: I don't like your fetish...\nKabuto: Ladyman #3.\nKimimaro: He's okay I guess.\nYoung characters: THOSE CHARACTERS FROM BEFORE BUT YOUNGER.\n\n\n\n\nThat's all of them I have unlocked.\nGOTY 2014 for me.

STAY AWAY AT ALL COSTS!\n\nThe previous game, Full Burst, was genuinely good and solid, so I had high expectations waiting for the Revolution.\nThey were shot down in flames.\n\nThe game has no story mode, only that filler-ish Tournament with the mecha-thingy, taken straight from one of the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, canon-twisting and ugly filler episodes.\n\nThe game has A LOT of playable chars, which is great, especially for the online mode. Basically, the only part truly worth playing would be the online mode.\n\nAnd here we have tiny little proble,\n\nONLINE MODE IS BLODDY UNPLAYABLE.\n\nFor many players, it has increcible, insufferable and unfixable lag. It starts even before an online match, in the online menu. I got this game to play with a friend who lives very close to me, in the neighbouring city. We both have good PCs and good net connections. We were really looking forward to playing the Revolution. Still, it was unplayable.\n\nI tried using a number of tweaks and fixes found online, to no avail. There are no patches, the devs are silent, nobody gives a damn. Nice way to treat your customer base. "Hey, Narutards, choke on this piece of trash and shut up, we don't care!". It's a complete insult. This whole game is an insult.\nThose responsible for the net code need a slap on the wrist. With a sledgehammer.\n\nI am not even considering buying the next game in the series, until I'm PRETTY DAMN SURE it's going to be fully playable in all its aspects. Then again, if pirates manage to make its online mode playable, I will just pirate it and not give a damn.

The fighting system is one of the most fast and frantic that I've ever played and perfectly translates from the manga and show battles that we have seen and read. The Story mode in this one is non-existant and is replaced with a tournament mode of sorts. But the Online battles and challenges are fun to test your skills and get familiar with each of the characters. Speaking of which, the characters are nice and varied and all have their own play styles. If you aren't familiar with the Naruto characters, but looking to try a new fighting game with a different combat system that isn't limited to 2-D, Then consider this one!","March 25, 2015","true","27.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unfortunately I was really looking forward to a story mode because I actually enjoy the story in the Anime. Although there are various other modes that kind of make up for it, but the new 4 player battle royale style is not the greatest, it feels like a filler.","September 16, 2014","true","14.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has the same great art style of Full Burst and the same battle stly with the addition of the Orb collecting battle. However, I was completely confused by the menu when I couldn't find a story mode only to find that the story was competing in the Ninja World Tournament over and over again which was rather disappointing as it had no real story behind it other than to be the best. The tournaments became extremely repetitive as soon as you reached the end of the C Rank tournament which was the 2nd playthrough. The Orb collecting 4 person battles were literally the only battles you did, there was no 1vs1 battles climbing where the winner climbs the ladder into the next round. like you'd see in an actual tournament . The online and free battles however did bring some fun into the game as you could do something else like team or single battles with a friend or by yourself. I'd still recommend the game.

I am a very addicted player, and I can have a good control of the battle. But when I tried the online mode, I got my butt kicked, because it was so sluggish that I could not perform a basic combo!)\n- the orb system is boring and broken. You start playing, it's kinda ok. But when you get to rank S, it is REAL boring to play, because there are no new challenges, and the NPC enemy gang up on you, and all you get to do is to dodge all your way hoping who is attacking you get trapped or step on the traps you lay down.\n- It is not a real story mode with last boss. Mecha naruto story has it, but anyway, you gotta play the boring orb battles first\n- the characters characteristics does not match what you have on naruto universe.\n- if you did not see the entire series, you will have a lot of spoilers. It is not really a bad one to consider, but you will be very disappointed when you begin to know something you are not supposed to.\n- the drive and awakening battle type feels weaker than the ultimate combo one. I don't know if it is a personal issue, but ultimate jutsu battle type is much more easier to fight than the other types.\n\n\nMy final words: If you have played Naruto Ninja Storm 3 Full Burst, you will find out this one is REALLY BORING! Ok, we have new jutsus, a great improvement on avoidability mechanics (RT does the strafing), but no. I thought this was a good game until I played his antecessor full burst.

I'd say it's even more appealing than Mortal Kombat in terms of visuals. Special attacks and combos are easier to perform which only makes the actual combat more fun: you don't bother with pushing multiple buttons and trying to perform combos and ultimate jutsus, but instead you have time to think when is the best time to perform them. Maybe it's not what hardcore players would like to play, but those who are fans of the anime/manga will definitely like it.\nCharacter roster is huge, but with some duplicates (but they differ in costumes and jutsu's they use).\nStory mode is cool, I cleared "The Creation of Akatsuki" and so much liked it (two more campaings left). And more importantly it's canon and you won't see this complete story anywhere else, so I suggest to play it.\nOnline battles are cool, however most opponents are too experienced players and if you're still newbie, you will lose a lot. Always watch out for the ping indicator before starting online battle, if it's red you will most likely have lags.\nAnyway, 8/10","December 28, 2014","true","14.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The fighting mechanics are a bit better though Drive seems to be a bit OP.  Tons of characters from the manga to pick from and combine with.

The fighting system is one of the most fast and frantic that I've ever played and perfectly translates from the manga and show battles that we have seen and read. The Story mode in this one is non-existant and is replaced with a tournament mode of sorts. But the Online battles and challenges are fun to test your skills and get familiar with each of the characters. Speaking of which, the characters are nice and varied and all have their own play styles. If you aren't familiar with the Naruto characters, but looking to try a new fighting game with a different combat system that isn't limited to 2-D, Then consider this one!","March 25, 2015","true","27.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It seems like all the games this company puts out such as ninja storm or the new DBZ xenoverse game get progressively worse. Every game has less characters, less story line and more boring combat.\n\nOutside of that one complaint my only other would be for ever 1-2 hours of game play you get 1 fight. The only way to actually fight in this fighting game is to do free battles otherwise you are looking at a lot of pointless map roaming and endless "cut scenes"  And just as with DBZ instead of putting any work into "bosses" they just make them immune to stagger from your attacks. They don't count more, block more, or attack more. It's jsut that your attacks can all be countered because you can't stagger them. I can't say enough bad things about this game.

The reason is because this game is overpriced for what it offers as pure boring regurgitation of past Naruto games. It offers very little as something youd consider "new" and "revolutionary" no pun intended. But nevertheless I did enjoy the battles. And some characters offer different special attacks when they are on the same team. Depending on what style you select you get a varied expereince with gameplay. Giving you more of an option to choose how you wanna fight. But youll most likely end up button mashing the hell out of your substitutions until youre completely dry and panic as your opponent rips you a new one. Thats one thing I do not like about these games. Ones you use up your substitutions you cant break away from a combo unless your opponent is a f*cktard and doesnt know how to press one buton in sucsession. Can we get a counter button maybe? A kunai throw to throw off the opponents opposition and maybe escape? In naruto you see them guarding, punching, dodging, but here its just random combos, substitutions and special attacks. Of course it is a fighting game. But there could be so much more to these games. And this is coming from someone who has played them since the first one on ps3. (I still ♥♥♥♥ing love that one. btw)\n\n\nI give this game a 5/10.","February 18, 2015","false","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you're going to buy one Naruto game, get Ninja Storm 3. This one is much less content heavy and really isn't recommended unless you really like Naruto/the Naruto games.

It's not the best fighting game I've ever played. Not even close. But the mechanics are nice enough to keep me happy. If you're looking for in depth combos and crazy button imputs this isn't the game. Everything is really simply and pretty quick to pick up. The big thing is in learning the best time to do different attacks and which ones lend themselves best to your play style. Once you figure that out you're pretty much set. Personally I started playing as Hinata and never looked back.\n\nThere are some downsides to the game, at least in my eyes. The things that you do in the game are the same thigns that you will be doing the entire game. They add in new mechanics to the four person fights from time to time, but really it's still using the same combos that you do while you're in a regular battle. That's fine though, I kind of expected that. The real problem here is with the online multiplayer. The lag completely kills that part of the experience. I know how to play the game at an okay level, but with the lag I input the dodge button and it doesn't happen. I try to load chakra and it just won't happen. It's frustrating to lose a battle mostly because your internet isn't quick enough. It's especially frustrating in a fighting game that requires quick reflexes. I played a couple of online matches and I'm not sure I would play any more of them. I really want to since that's the best part of fighting games, but with the input lag it just doesn't become fun for me.\n\nIf you're a fan of the games this one, or really any of the Naruto fighting games, is a good one to grab. If you're looking for a great fighting game then you might want to try something else.","January 18, 2015","true","16.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The tournaments became extremely repetitive as soon as you reached the end of the C Rank tournament which was the 2nd playthrough. The Orb collecting 4 person battles were literally the only battles you did, there was no 1vs1 battles climbing where the winner climbs the ladder into the next round. like you'd see in an actual tournament .

About this, PLEASE DO A SERIOUS AKATSUKI SURVIVAL MODE (with all the 10 members to fight: Deidara, Sasori, Hidan, Kakuzu, Itachi, Konan, Pain, Kisame, Obito & Madara could be a good sequence to follow);\n---: all throw jitsu that crush the enemy to the ground have awful (totally lacking in impact) sound effects (they were 10 times better in UNS 3);\n---: I don't like the idea of choosing 1 style of combat; it reduces gameplay variety (because you can use only something, and not the whole arsenal of the selected character).\n\nMy final rank: 9/10.","August 23, 2015","true","252.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But other than that it's a solid fighting game. Had some epic rivalry matches with friends. Buy it on a sale.","November 8, 2015","true","25.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
