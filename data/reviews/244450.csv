But more than that, I was buying the sequel to one of my favorite games of all time.\n\nNeedless to say, I haven't been impressed.  In fact, my experience with AS2 has been beyond disappointment.  Given the time from the early beta stage to now, and including the push-back of the release date multiple times, I've found that this game has not only been a waste in terms of what potential it had, but you are literally paying for a $34.00 overhaul patch by buying this game.\n\nThe biggest improvements since AS-1 have been:\n\n1.  Multiplayer, which lags often, and depends on who is better at storming a place with infantry and light vehicles.  Tanks are, very rarely fielded.  The gameplay is repetitive, and balance issues come and go.\n\n2.  The Super-Pershing and a few tank models.  Yeah, they look a little more "smooth," but then you can take a peek at everything else.  Everything else is literally recycled from the previous game.\n\n3.  Multi-core support.  I haven't noticed a difference.\n\n\nThe things I'd thought I was going to see:\n\n1.  A little bit of variety in the infantry.  Yeah, they don't even have new models or textures.  It's the exact same thing from the previous title, rehashed a bit for a few more "Breeds," which you can make by simply opening the editor and reassigning a few traits, weapons, and items.  There are a few more voices thrown in for the American and English soldiers, but there is still plentiful cut-and-paste from the previous game.  Oh, and the voice acting is horrific for the most-part.\n\n2.  Better textures.  The dirt looks beautiful.  A few tanks look better.  But, for everything else, it all is recycled from the last game.  The buildings aren't different.  The uniforms aren't different.  The mass majority of vehicles aren't different.\n\n3.  Better gameplay.  Yeah, no.  In fact, they took away the feature where you could unload your guns.  The AI is a little more "Cover-seeking," so they are no longer inherently stupid.  However, you still have to pack up millions of bullets so they can fend for themselves without running dry.\n\n4.  Differences between faction weapons.  I'll admit, I was expecting more realistic performance out of the guns for each faction.  But, all rifles are pretty much the same, the Thompson isn't much different from an MP-40, the Grease-Gun is treated like a 9-mm, and overall, you're just going to go for an MG-42 if you want rate of fire; the browning if you want less reloading; or the BAR/FG-42 if you want less unloading.  There isn't much of an accuracy or damage difference.  Line up soldiers with every faction's rifle; they fire and reload at the exact, same times, with the exception of the enfield rifleman.  There should be a difference.  The action on a Mosin is completely different from a 98' or a Springfield.\n\n5.  Models and textures.  Yeah, about 10 vehicles look better.  But the mass majority of the others still look copy/paste.  If I wanted to copy/paste vehicles, I'd make a mod for that.\n\nCan I say I recommend this game?  No.  For $34.00, hell no.  It's nowhere near being worth that kind of money, and I'm losing to faith to tell myself that "yeah, it'll improve as they get closer to the full release."  It's been in Early Access for quite some time now.  Before that, there was beta.  They have had the time to improve the game.  Yet, I have only seen them trying to get it into a playable state every few weeks, while leaving us high and dry in every other aspect.  Maybe if it were $10.00 DLC for AS1, it'd be worth it.  But as a standalone game, let alone a Sequel, it's not just a cheap re-release with nothing new to offer, but it's a complete waste of money.\n\nI've already learned from one other game that pulled the same "Beta limited-content" trick.  ArmA 3.  Overall, that game was a complete disappointment.  There was very little content added into the beta, there was very little content added into the main game, and countless patches treated the post-final release like it was (and still is) in the early-access stage.  AS2 is mirroring this tactic, and foreshadows disappointment.\n\nI have a feeling they're going to just decide to "leave it to the modders," as ArmA 3 did, and while mods are often well done, they are not only far from uniform in quality and not designed by a common party, but that's a cheap way of copping-out of extensive work.  Work that this game seriously needs if it is to hold the number "2" after Assault Squad.\n\nA better name for this would be "Assault Squad: MEGAPATCH."  If you feel like disagreeing, then pull up the AS1 editor and the AS2 editor.  Put down one of every model.  Test the game, see what happens; you'll learn that I'm right, because this is exactly how I tested it.  I'm not making these claims without evidence.  There is no difference between these games except for the mulitplayer.\n\n\nDo keep in mind; this review is for a $34.00 product.  It is intended to reflect and aid you, the viewer, in determining whether or not you will "get what you pay for."  The answer to that is no, "No, you won't."\n\nI SINCERELY HOPE THAT THE FINAL RELEASE PROVES MY FEARS TO BE WRONG, AND RENDERS THIS REVIEW TO BE OUTDATED.  SHOULD THAT BE THE CASE, I WILL GLADLY CHANGE MY REVIEW AND HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE GAME.  SHOULD MY FEAR THAT THIS GAME OFFERS NO "CHANGE" WORTHY OF A SEQUEL BE CONFIRMED AT FINAL RELEASE, I WILL NO LONGER DO BUSINESS WITH DIGITAL-MIND-SOFT.\n\nDo know; I won't be alone in that regard.\n\n\n\n\n[July 19, 2014] UPDATE!\n\nOk; so since the game's release, there has been little to nothing improved upon since I had written this review.  The "priority" for the team has only been multiplayer.  There has been no increase in content.  There has been no more bang for the buck.  Digital-Mind-Soft has charged their community for a mere patch, and has done nothing to back the quality of the game except tamper with multiplayer mechanics, and not even to the extent that significantly alters gameplay in any way.\n\nDo you have money to waste, and want to support a dishonest development project?  Then don't spend money.  Please.\n\nStop giving companies the motivation to screw over their customers and to default on their promises.  It's been months, and there aren't even any new "Humanskins" in the game.  Let me say right now:  It takes 10 MINUTES OR LESS TO CREATE A NEW "SKIN" USING PAINT.NET.\n\nWith the time they've taken to add "boards" to Multiplayer, I could have created the entire Italian Army with a modeling program; sadly, that's 3DS-MAX, a program that the 2014 edition of, costs upwards of $3,400 to own.\n\n\n\n\n[August 26 2014] UPDATE!\n\nPlaying through the editor a bit, one of the first things I checked were the models.  What can I say about them?  Three new models; all Crusader Tanks.  The model has been significantly improved, with the Crusader looking more streamlined and smooth than before.  It looks good.  Not only that, but there are 2 more Crusaders; a 40mm Anti-Air crusader, and a 20mm Anti-Air crusader.  These, too, look good.  But nonetheless, Japanese vehicles still look as though they are made out of cardboard, and there haven't been any other model updates added.\n\nMost importantly, the soldiers still have the same skins as in the previous title; the lack of effort in this category is appaling.  Do bare in mind; Assault Squad was a 2009 game.  This means that the soldier's skins are 5 Years old.  You can learn to create professional 3D models in half that time.  Given that this much time has progressed, one would and should expect more from a company charging full-price for a "patchwork" game.","May 1, 2014","false","26.6"," 371 of 456 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","371","456","0","28"

I have to say that I am having very few graphical issues, only one instance where i can remember a serious shader error but it was easily fixed by minimizing the game and re opening it. The graphics do look very nice and there are several small details i appreciate like the ejecting shell and the smoke from the breech of the cannon and other small things that added to the whole. The gameplay is just as good as the first Assault Squad and ive played 3 matches so far and 2 of them had good frame rates and all while one was bad but hey 2:3 isnt to bad especially for pre-release. There is still the fun 3rd person mode and all the other things that make men of war the amazing RTS it is. I would certinly reccomend this game to any fan of the men of war series and really to anyone who enjoys RTS's or stratagy games in general.","January 18, 2014","true","46.5"," 441 of 571 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","441","571","0","57"

So much for internet free speech.\n\n\nValve gave devs certain power within their community hub with the sole purpose of moderating discussions and keeping flamers and trolls at check, and not to silence sound and constructive criticism. By abusing that power over and over again a dev team is effectively signing their own death warrant and essentially commiting career suicide.\n\n\nUnlike what they might think, our protests are neither a manifestation of a vindicative vendeta neither hatred or past grievances directed towards them, it's about doing the sensible and candid thing. I'm sure that an outsider who would simply look at the facts would advocate the stance which many of the old-guard and the new players have adopted against dms.\n\n\n\nAS2 was never planned prior to the unexpected gamespy closure( which was itself announced/leaked pre-emptively about 15 months prior to AS2 being officially released). Hence DMS was presented with two choices, either acquire a similar service to gamespy or release a re-branded game. Practically both choices are nearly identical in terms of the necessary procedural steps.\n\n\nObviously, they opted for the latter option, and in a way they indirectly extorted hard-core fans by halting multiplayer support for a game that mp is it's primary aspect. Think of it like what would happen to cs:go if steam were to go bankrupt. Though, I don't really blame them for their choice, a company is first and foremost created to be profitable while consumer benefit and income are ideally mutually re-enforcing features.\n\n\nAnyhow, forget all that, the thing that really grinds my gears is that they took a perfectly functional game, sold it again for a second time without adding dx11 support or any major content/engine upgrade and they added all the AS1 paid dlc to make up for the lack of substantial additions.\n\n\nApparently, mainly due to their neglect which stems from greediness and arrogance they failed tragically into delivering a solid product. Now more than a year after release they still haven't dedicated the appropriate time needed to fix the game-breaking coding-errors which lead to excessively inefficient resource usage and, frequent mp crashing,  notoriously established as the Out-Of-Sync problem as well as a frustrating collection of certain bugs that transcended from AS.\n\n\nSo what has the Wizzard of OOS (pun by kon1402) commonly known to us plebs as Instinct done about these game breaking problems since then? Absolutely bloody nothing. He now officially stated that he is going to work exclussively on their new tittle Call To Arms which is a modern warfare game based on the as2 engine and now on closed alpha- a game that was crowd-funded in late 2012 and was supposed to be WIP for the last 3 years. I was quite astonished when I found out that the m1a2, T-80U and some other AFVs use the late ww-2 King Tiger's 88 kwk43 gun, as well jet engines sounding like ww-2 piston engines and dozen other instances of recycled assets. I can't imagine the state of CTA if they were still also working in as2.\n\n\nAt the end of the day I won't even analyse the good qualities of the game, let alone recommend it, as for its entire existence it was always broken. Assault squad used to be a great game, one of my favourites I might add but Assault squad 2 has left me with a bitter taste. Giving it a score would be futile and arbitrary, they took AS which was a 9/10 game and tranformed it into an unplayble mess.\n\nKeep your alans boys and spend it on another tittle, I reckon it will be many a'months before AS2 can reach AS standards let alone surpass it, a definitive no from me.\n\nIt's saddening me that the old-guard that I used to play with is en-large abandoning the game and even though there isn't really another WW-2 themed interactive and realistic rts, I will in turn also quit the game for now.","July 16, 2015","false","988.9"," 485 of 673 people (72%) found this review helpful 48 people found this review funny","72","485","673","48","52"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wildbillhdmax02/recommended/244450/","wildbillhdmax02","wildbillhdmax01","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wildbillhdmax02/","401 products in account","Men of war Assault squad 2 is the sequel to the well received Assault Squad. Even with this being a sequel there are still major and blatant problems with this game.\n\n1st. Lack of new content.\nThe 1st problem with this game is that there isn't very much new content. For being a sequel you would think there would be. It's more of an over all update to the 1st game. The only thing that the 2nd game added is an updated a game with better optimization, better UI, graphics, sound, and Steam features. There is 15 "New" single player "skirmishes", plus 25 reworked old ones from the original Assault Squad. Making 40 single player missions. Which isn't very much, especially being 25 old one. Which let me remind you that is "3", "3" new Missions for each Nations.\n\nMost of the new content that is been added as been added in patches. That were a lot of its coming from. Like health bar, skins, models, sounds, Units and new voices.\n\n2nd. AI\nOne of the thing you will ran across it the Stupid AI both on the enemies side and your Units. You will be doing a lot of micromanagement, do to the stupidity of your units. A good example would be your medics not picking up your dead men unless told to do so! It's not uncommon to get focus on one part of the battlefield only to come back and see 4-5 men on the ground and your medic sitting there. Making you to manually to him to get each one.\n\nAmour showing their ♥♥♥ and side to the enemy or just refusing to turn their front to the enemy. If you know anything about tanks or amour, you would know that the thickest amour is in the front. Well someone didn't tell your troops. Because 1 too many time have I had to take over control of a tank or Amour car and position it the right way.\n\nSniper will sit there a lot even though they have clear shot on enemy troops. So many times I've had to click on enemy troops to get my snipers to pick off targets.\nAT (Anti Tank) troops will ran across an open battlefield to shot a tank point blank range. When  I've be able to take control and do from half of the Range. I've literally watch Panzerschreck troops ran straight to a tank and get killed, and if that is no enough a lot of the times, they will just stare at it from a far while it kills all his comrades! Even better is when they're right next to it, get killed, and didn't even fire a shot.\n\nWith this Friendly and enemy troops won't even fire at one another even when theres a tank troop right on the other side of the dead tank. They will both sit there.\n\nEnemy troops will hide and sit there when to many casualties are taken, instead of running, and regrouping. You are now force to ran to the 1 or 2 enemy solders and completely annihilate them with a full squad. If not? You can ignore them and continue your advance to the next objective!\n\nSo let me set this up for you.\nThe enemy is pushing on one side of the map hard, with Infantry, Tanks, and an armored car. You get caught up in this side of the map tiring to stop this advance. You are slugging it out knocking out tanks and shooting down Infantry, making sure your troops are fighting right, and micromanagement them so do not lose this side of the battlefield. Making sure your Panzerschreck troops are firing (Or even just taking control your self...) medics are get the dying up, and that your troops are picking the right targets.\n\nOnly to win that fight, go to look at the other side of the battlefield and see that your man have been annihilate because your medic didn't pick up the dead, your AT troops sat there, etc...\n\nThis is a very small list of some the stupid this that the AI does. I could go on picking out all the stupid drown right unbelievable things the AI will do. You literally need to micromanagement most if not all your troops.\n\n3rd. A lack of total content.\nLest be honest here. It is not skirmish, these are single player Missions/campaigns. If you played a RTS before you most likely played one with a skirmish mode which is AI vs you and Ally AI on a map with some object or just to kill the other side.\n\nThis is a major problem do to the fact that those 40 missions get old fast. Since 1st 25 of then are old one from AS1, 2nd after you complete them there isn't any thing to do after but to replay them over and over again. And most of the missions are just a Assault on key objective over and over again just on a different map. Some of the New missions are defensive mission or Sniper missions.\n\nIf you wanted new content you're ♥♥♥♥ed. There is 2 way to go. Go to the work shop and download user made missions or learn to use the Editor. Which is ridiculous!\n\n1st The editor isn't easy enough for the average player to make new content for themselves. It isn't easy enough to even to make simple battles, let a lone missions. There isn't any Tutorials to help you except for one guy on YouTube, but he doesn't tell enough for how to make a mission or even a good battle. All these Epic battles on YouTube are just some guy placing random Units on each side, and having then ball up in  an orgy in middle of the map and just kill. As if they weren't even train as soldiers. Taking no cover, nothing just kill, kill, kill.\nI hear from the New patch that just came out, that DLC is on the way which in true is another sad joke, because now they're going to sell you new content that should of been in the game in the 1st place. IMHO they need to make a FREE DLC, that adds 10 new missions for each faction, then I can walk a way content. Because even with that, that still wouldn't be enough for a game that $35. Do to the fact that it has very low replay value. In my honest opinion they really should of been 25- 30 new mission and the 25 old ones as Thank you to the fans. Then I could of walk away happy, but still disappointed in no Real skirmish mode.\n\nWhen it comes to the DLC, most likely it will be a couple of new missions, and a Couple of new multiplayer maps. Which should of been in the in the 1st place. 5 missions for $5 which is a such a bad joke it's unbelievable. What they need to do is Add new Nations, with Missions and New units equipment, etc. Like Italy, which was talked about on the Steam Community Hub forums, and is a great Idea. Why not do a Axis minors pack with Hungary and Romania , or even a Allies Minor pack? Poland would be a Great one too, or even France. With this then you can do Missions pack with 20-30 or so missions. Or even just expansion to the already existing nations, with New units, equipment, missions, etc.\n\nWith all of this, It seems like this game was made for multiplayer, yet the multiplayer is dead. Yet It was the same way with AS1. The most I've seen is about 8-10 lobbies at prime times. Even if you were to play multiplayer, you would most likely get your ♥♥♥ kick by a veteran of the games Anyway.\n\n4th. The verdict\nThe problem is that they made this really great RTS, (one of the best I've played) but doesn't have any content in it. Out of all the RTS games I've played, this one has the lest amount of content. And I've played them all, I've played Command & Conquer, Age of Empires, Company of Heroes, Empire Earth, Total War, Star Wars Empire At War, Dawn of War, World In Conflict, StarCraft, and many more I can't think of right now.\n\nThe Biggest problem is that I feel that they just made the tools for you make your own content. As if they made AI, the Units, UI, etc, and just sold you the tools to make your own game, and made a some missions as examples.\n\nWould I recommend this game? I would say No. Because even though it's a great game, with the lack of content and the Good but over just an update to the 1st AS there isn't much here. It being 6 month since release, they could still save this game, with a FREE DLC Mission pack, ( With more then just 1 missions for each Nations!!!!) and some new Nations DLCs. But the big problem will still be the replay value, do to no real skirmish mode.\n","October 15, 2014","false","39.3"," 456 of 634 people (72%) found this review helpful 38 people found this review funny","72","456","634","38","20"

Most players have already shelfved it or moved over to BoE although it has the old MoW look but at leas ti runs smooth.\n\n\nEdit: Review update: 11/19/2014\n\nMore than half a year later DMS managed somehow to improve the performance marginally. 2vs2 is now possible but with more players you still face lag and drops. 4vs4 is still unplayable and the long time ago promised 8vs8 has never been delivered. Gameplaywise it is the still the same arcadish spam and clickfest on tiny maps  although the dedicated community has made a lot of suggestions how to improve it at least a bit. So far DMS decided not to listen to the community and treat the rest of its loyal fan base with ignorance. Slightest critisism result in bans and locked threads. Rumors say DMS treats its employees in a similar way, would at least explain why they fail to fix their game. DMS also has decided to sell the replay feature as paied DLC as it is "new" for them while it is for  other games an included  basic feature. So far  all arguments form the old review are sadly still vaild.\n\nIf you really look for a WW 2 themed game, grap CoH. It runs better , it looks better and it is just a bit more arcadish than AS 2. If you look for a realistic WW 2 go for Graviteam Tactics or the good old Blitzkrieg. In the end AS 2 is not even worth the 5 bugs when it is on sale especially with DMS's questionable behaviour.\n_______________________________________________________________________________-\nReview 6/11/2014\n\nAs a long time player and supporter of DMS and the Mow series, I sadly have to say that  AS 2 is a big fail at its current state. The game has a lots of serious issues and it looks like  that DMS is not willing to fix their game or they  just can not.It seems AS 2 is more  a desperate attempt by DMS to grap some players form its rivial COH  and milk a bit the small loyal players with the result that the series was dumped down pretty hard.\n\nAS 2 is in general a  copie of AS 1(same units same models) with  the diffrence that AS 1 works. The game engine has been updated so the game looks a bit more polished than AS 1 but now  it tends to lag as hell. Currently it is not even  possible to play 2vs2 lag free or without freezes. Matches with higher playercount (4vs4 max!) are more or less impossible as the players drop like flies due to heavy lag caused by the poor net code and/or engine.\n\nBesides the technical issues the gameplay suffers also a lot from some designe decisions. In AS 1 it was possible to have a nice tank fight or the chance to flank your enemy. This does not work in AS 2 due to tiny maps and ridiculus ranges for tanks. The current gameplay is only focused on spamming wave after wave of infantry. Tanks or emplacements like at guns are not really needed. The entire gameplay feels artificially  pressed in tiny maps  to create a CoH feeling. In additon DMS has also forgotten or did not want to fix existing problems like the strange pathfinding of  the units or the overcomplicated resupply system.\n\nDMS has also introduced an unlock system for new players to getting them used to the units . Sadly this creates more fustration as locked units for all factions seem to have been picked randomly and creates very unfair games especially in matchmaking. But in general this  does not matter as the Matchmaking system does not work properly as well. Tutorials, or a real Skirmish (not the repetitiv SP Missions which they call Skirmish) would have been more helpful for newcomers as the game still explains nothing. It is even hard to say how many people play the game as there is no lobby anymore, only the steamchat which is pretty empty. Also the server browser is bugged as it only shows max 50 servers, most of them skirmish servers so not sure how many try to play MP.\n\nDMS had a lot of time to get their act together. Closed beta for CtA backers (what i did), open beta, delay of the release as the game did not run but was surprisingly  ready for preordering, another dealy of the release and the unannouced move to Early Access without any compensation and several post release patches  should have been enough time to create a game  which offers a kind of enjoyment. The only good thing is the steamworkshop where really dedicated and talented modders can present their creations.\n\nAs for now the game can not be recommanded, even it would be on a steam sale.","June 11, 2014","false","226.6"," 178 of 248 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","178","248","0","11"

I have been following this series since the original MoW. I have poured over 1200 hours in the orginal game, MoW assault squad1, and this game as well. I have played almost every mission, fought on every multiplayer mode, and have enjoyed both multiplayer and singleplayer modifications. However I can honestly say that this game in the series is a disgrace.\n\nIt's been over a year since release and yet in every single game I have played in the past few days online I have or had one of my teammates/enemies drop because of out of sync issues. This game should have never been released and instead the already built upon multiplayer system of AS1 should have been expanded into steam instead of milking out money from the followers of this series by releasing this garbage.\n\nI hope that the developers find it in their time to salvage whats left of this broken game and it's disheartened community instead of releasing more DLC's or call to arms. However looking back at the past year and seeing the lack of stability I highly doubt that the multiplayer will be in any working condition anytime soon. If you are interested in this game do not buy it, wait until you hear word about the multiplayer being in a stable condition or try out the original MoW as it has a lot of fun singleplayer content through mods and its orginal missions.","June 8, 2015","false","566.5"," 126 of 170 people (74%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","74","126","170","18","2"

If you haven't played the first of the Assualt Squads I have no hesitation recommending this for purchase if you have an interest in a deep WW2 real time strategy. Particularly if you played the earlier MoW and want a bit more then you won't be disappointed.\n\nFor those that haven't played any of the series MoW is an extremely deep RTS, each of your units has an inventory containing their weapons, ammo and equipment (including hat). Each of these units can also be controlled directly by you at any moment. This makes for glorious moments where you crawl a single man with TNT up behind a enemy Tiger and blow it to kingdom come, or your single tank goes on a rampage causing chaos everywhere. In addition to inventories and direct control there are a bunch of game mechanics to consider, the cover system and terrain is essential to keeping the squishy bits on the inside of your man shaped meat sacks. The ballistics and penetration mechanics are supremely important to tanks, angle your armour and more shots will bounce, shoot through buildings and your rounds will lose kinetic energy. Oh and you can destroy pretty much any structure if you fancy it.\n\nThe problem arises when contemplating a step up from the first Assault Squad. At first glance it doesn't appear like there is that much of a difference, it looks and plays very much like the first one with a few interface tweaks and improved graphics. Many of the improvements over the first are "behind the scenes" such as improved kill count mechanics and multiplayer functionality. The major game changer is the steam integration, massively increasing the availability of content and (most of the time) the ease with which you can play it. Sure the quality of a scenario or map will vary but there are good ones out there and reviews and comments make it reasonably easy to find them.\n\nThe new content is solid if a bit uninspiring, but new units and fixes are being dripfed into the game and what was a bit of a disappointing release in the beginning is getting nicely rounded out. So if you can get this at a discount then do it and check out the workshop, if you want a first time foray into the series then this is the one to get, the depth of the MoW series can not be oversold and when you get it, it is a thing of beauty. It should probably be mentioned most of my experiences are through co-op to give some kind of perspective. PvP is tense, painful, frustrating and beautifully rewarding in equal measure.\n\nJust keep stealing hats and MGs and don't mention the voice acting.","November 8, 2014","true","47.6"," 88 of 119 people (74%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","74","88","119","13","1"

These guys are very loose in their communication, and their responses on their forums tend to be unprofessional and hostile towards criticism. There appears to be no plan, and they just sort of wing whatever they want into the game. Which is unfortunate, because this is actually an entertaining RTS game.\n\nThe straw that broke the camel's back for me was they put AI (bots) for multiplayer skirmishes behind a paywall DLC. That is absolutely absurd, and I believe goes on record as the first RTS game to EVER do that in the history of RTS games. AI skirmishes is something that practically every RTS game offers, I mean Starcraft 1 and the first Command & Conquer had AI skirmishes in the base game. This game did not, and then they finally add it, BEHIND a paywall. Absolutely absurd.\n\nAn official developer's response on the matter:\n"if you do not want it don't buy it."\n\nWell firstly Mr Smarty Pants, I do want it; good job reading the OP's post, because we are ticked because we do want it, and you decided to paywall a basic feature. However I won't buy it with that unprofessional attitude. Since my money isn't something you seem to want, then I will keep it to invest in a better product. I am going to say that I am pretty appalled by this move, this is honestly the first RTS I seen put AI skirmishes behind a paywall. You should really be ashamed of yourselves.\n\nWhat is gaming coming to when basic features are put behind paywalls? What next, will I have to pay for access to graphics options too? If they decide to rectify this then I will flop this review, otherwise no.\n\nSorry MoW, I like this series, but this just blew your standing with me and a lot of others.","June 18, 2015","false","28.9"," 55 of 67 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","55","67","2","0"

Now I think I gave them enough time to fix their game and to prove they care about their costumers, and I'am sorry but they failed...\n\nWhat to say ?  AS2 and its developers for me in 3 words ?  .. A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT !\n\nOn AS1 I had lot of hours of fun, even if to be sincere 95% of my hours on AS1 were spent with the German Soldiers Mod, a realism mod, so I give credits to DMS for making the basic game (wich is a modified version of the originall MoW by Best Way) but if was not for Blubork's GSM and all the MoW modders, I'am not sure about how many hours I could have on AS1.\n\nSo in general from MOW to AS1 for me nothing big changed (not that other MOW titles brought bigger changes) if not improved graphic and other little details, main improvements arrived thanks to the evolving of the German Soldiers Mod and other mods, but all in all I was happy with the AS1 platform, they even released free updates with new models, and from time to time I could have fun with the vanilla game too, even if nothing serious.\n\nMain problems of AS1 vanilla for me were the artificial weapon datas and in general the lack of realism, not that MoW was realistic, for example regarding ranges AS1 was a step forward, but with AS1 in my opinion the gameplay went even more fast paced and more CoH oriented.\nI always disagreed with the payback mechanic introduced by DMS, I find that rewarding a player for wasting units doesn't fit the Real-Time-STRATEGY genre, to help new players you need to make in game tutorials (still absent in AS2).\n\nSo when AS2 was announced I went on AS2 forum and asked personally to devs if AS2 was going to be a more realism oriented game, not a sim, just more realistic, and they put there the fact that they were going to implement realistic weapon datas, I also asked them if they were planning to implement a territory mode like I suggested in the past and again they answered me that something was coming to satisfy this suggestion too.\nSo as I'am a positive person and I like to help who deserve it, I was super happy and I decided to help in the funding of their future CTA title too, even if I was not really interested in a post WWII era MoW.\n\nThen the big day to try AS2 arrived...\n\n...and this sadly was my first reaction after trying it (was obviously in italian but I'll try to translate it:) )\n\n\n"What the ♥♥♥♥ ?? are you kidding me ?!"\n\nYes, it can sound rude but this sincerely was my reaction when trying AS2 for the first time.\n\nPerformances were terrible (but it was beta so at that time I still had hope here), improvements compared to AS1 ? little to nothing , and it not ends here....\n\nRanges were reduced and the gameplay was damn fast paced, maps had a terrible artificial arena look and were damn small, nothing  like my suggested territory mode,  instead an extreme battle zone mode that had nothing to do with what I suggested, even the realistic weapon datas were not that realistic as the Tiger tank could "360 non scope" in one second with its famously and historically known SLOW turret traverse.\n\nRegarding the vanilla game a total disappointment, however the full steam implementation was a nice thing and my thought was that performances could improve as promised and once GSM was released then I could just play that and avoid the CoH like vanilla gameplay, even if having to always rely on mods to enjoy a game to be sincere is quite annoying.\nNo less I even created an AS2 thread on the most famous Italian tech forum, I was still supporting the devs despite the problems and failed expectations.\n\nAfter months of waiting I realized I passed more time on the AS2 hub than in game as the game performances were terrible and the vanilla game gameplay a total rush and grenade spam that I was unable to enjoy.\nAgain, I tried to stay positive and give my best to stay present on the AS2 hub and give suggestions, I invested my precious time there but what I discovered was just that, even with their community the Devs were doing a terrible job, threads locked, people banned, not a sign of listening to player suggestions, even Devs replying to suggestions in a quite arrogant way or over-defending their product and "vision" at all costs, making you feel like a ♥♥♥♥ and totally impotent toward the series future.\nI was speechless, I was no more able to recognize the devs I used to like and I helped by being backer and always preordering their products.\n\nAt same time of this hard blow by AS2 devs, on the other hand, I had Arma 3 devs with their feedback tracker and a forum that is more like a virtual office, where players and devs collaborate to make a better game.\nAnd Arma series too started small and niche, for A3 they kept on the realism way so one can think they sold less compared to the more arcade AS2 that tried to follow the mainstream arcade way, but no, this is an outdated way of thinking IMO, now in 2015 you sell more if you make a quality product and you stay HONEST and HELP/ LISTEN to PEOPLE, that's what matter to make an healthy game and business, we are no more in the 20th century, I like to think that people evolved and started punishing the soulless greedy business. look at the paid mod for Skyrim, people must be heard or they revolt.\n\nBack to AS2, last but not least disappointment, that ultimately made me quit with the game in December 2014, was that basically if the AS2 vanilla game already had problems in MP, Big mods then were totally unplayable, just crashes, desync and horrible performances, mods that were able to run fine on MoW, now on AS2 years later were unplayable.\nThe OOS issue made us crash 75% of the times in games bigger than 2v2.\n\nBasically the only thing that right now work in AS2 is the SP or MP below 2v2 (if both players have a great PC).\nBut if you want to play SP then what's the point of getting AS2 ? yes thanks to workshop you find mods easily but for SP AS1/MOW are good enough and still have SP mods putting there new stuff for free, right now I can't find any good reason to suggest you AS2, specially with this dev behaviour toward their customers.\n\nPositive things yes, the auto resupply, veterancy and like I said workshop, but is it enough ? I let you judge on this.\n\nLuckily the MOW series is not dead, now we have Battle of Empires that is very promising and where Devs really listen to their community as well as the future Best Way game "outfront" on the new engine, in the hope they will not commit same DMS mistakes, like developing two games at the same time as an indie company with low budget ?! I would say maybe better to concentrate your effort to one game per time and listening to your community, or not ?\nAS2 in the end proved to be a mere way to fund CTA.\n\nThis MoW series has an huge potential to become the best RTS ever and an awesome sandbox platform, for now to be sincere all MoW developers failed to unleash its full potential and make it a really successful game that, like Arma III in the Tactical-FPS genre, can become a milestone of its genre and make PC gamers proud of it.\n\nLet's see what the future will reserve to us MoW players. I know some things are going behind the scene that may surprise us in the future of this series,I'am not going to talk about them right now, but I'am positive :)\n\ngodspeed\n\n\nPS: my 400+ hours are mostly beta testing GSM, all time wasted as GSM is a MP mod and it wont work on AS2 : )  (even if according to Devs and workshop there is mod support)\n\nSo I even went "light" on this review, I could write worst, but unlike DMS I'am a gentleman.\n\ncheers\n\nHaZZarD","May 31, 2015","false","400.1"," 324 of 501 people (65%) found this review helpful 41 people found this review funny","65","324","501","41","31"

The in depth armour system and weapon mechanics are complimented by fantastic graphics that are pleasing to the eye as well as improved UI from the previous Assault squad title. Although the current beta is a bit chunky i have the utmost faith in the developers at Digital Mindsoft to continue the fantastic legacy brought by the first title.\n\nThe gameplay is in-depth, the setting and units accurate, the gradual increase to the scale of warfare presented in a skirmish or Multiplayer competitive matchup is a welcome test of one’s foresight and planning as more often than not the crucial moment of victory will not come in one distinct period of the game. The ability of this game to allow a player to exploit an opponent’s flaws in defence or his ability to capitalise on his own armoured or support advantage is astounding. A player may use a series of approaches to try and obtain victory, and the games can end up insanely close as players scramble and crawl their way to victory. Nothing beats the feeling of outwitting your opponents and somehow pulling a victory out of thin air.\n\nIf you seek a game that compares to company of heroes you must look elsewhere as both titles have their own distinct style of gameplay. If you want an in-depth somewhat realistic WW2 RTS with stunning gameplay, good graphics and a stellar community look no further. All elements of the game compliment your experience to make for one of the best, if not the best WW2 RTS games in today’s market, and i hope that if you choose to purchase this title, that you will enjoy it as much as i have.\n","January 22, 2014","true","143.0"," 159 of 237 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","159","237","0","0"

The gameplay is the same and the only thing that changed are some weapon configurations and range settings. Everything else's basically the same.\n\nAs a plus though, Men of War - Assault Squad 2 has Steam integration, something Men of War - Assault Squad 1 lacks and thus is unplayable in normal multiplayer matches due to the fact that Game Spy shut down.

Otherwise you should go for Men of War - Assault Squad 2, because it features Steam Workshop & match making and runs on a more modern engine tuned towards high end systems.","October 14, 2014","true","29.3"," 81 of 113 people (72%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","72","81","113","3","0"

The compaign can get quite tedius and repetitious (since several maps are repeated with different plants and weather conditions) or it's the same couple of mission sets.  While the game itself is well rounded, the developers failed to address the issues that arose in the first AS.\n\nPros: Multiplayer, though to be honest it's not greatly improved from what I can tell.\n\nCons: Single Player.  Really.  Save your money and just buy MoW Assault Squad.  It's cheeper and has the same maps and abiities (scratch and add a few minor things.)\n\nTo give you an idea on how much they cheaped out on things, there's no real voice actors.  I first noticed it in the Russian campaign when I realized the "commanders voice" sounded like a 15 year old American boy.  All in all I wish I had my money back and stuck to the first AS.","April 25, 2014","false","23.7"," 113 of 166 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","113","166","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Honketh/recommended/244450/","Honketh","MightyHonk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Honketh/","227 products in account","Finally a game about ww2 without one-sided balance.\nYou can die for the Motherland, Fatherland, Churchill, Freedumbs or Emperor without yelling that everything enemy has is OP (japanese tanks will make you raise your eyebrows tho). Everything feels good: how tanks react, how infantry throw grenades or change weapons depending on target on their own, tanks and artillery operate at beliveable range, armor thickness and angle seems to work in realistic fashion too. However some weapons that should penetrate 160mm of armor can't kill pz4 which may be just bad luck, but is irritating for sure. Also it's always a big fanservice to me when each faction speaks on it's own language, instead of "Kill that faschistsky ♥♥♥♥ for stalin comerade boris tovarichs brat comerade" nonsense.\n\n\nBut, and it's a big BUT (Y(__|, there's some things that really SUCK:\n1) it's basically same as previous game with like 5 new maps, fancier graphics and ♥♥♥♥♥ier netcode, yet costs full price and it seems that AS1 servers are closed.\n\n2)If someone in same match as you have PC FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES, you will have tremendous lags too.\n\n3)Units' pathfinding is probably most infuriating thing i encountered in my life, and believe me, living in Russia you will get thing or two to be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at in your lyf. Units will try to go through impassable terrain and get stuck if you wont control them like babies, infantryman, after an order to throw grenade can start doing modern dance moves and catch a bullet instead, SU-122 will agro at infantry and will get shot by Jagtiger in the ♥♥♥ when you're not looking, etc.\n\n4)INTERFACE. Your first couple of hours will be literally unplayable since you will have to call all the scientists in the world specializing in awful GUI to help you figure out what the hell is going on with this squad control. Also half of your keyboard is some random hotkeys that control everything from towing artillery pieces to manually jacking off your soldiers.\n\n5)Units' field of view: you will see for yourself should you decide to play this.\n\n6)ELO in a game where 2v2, 3v3, 4v4 modes exist. People just never learn that it only works in 1v1.\n\nNow after my ♥♥♥ finally chilled, let's get back to good shieeet again.\n\nUnit variety: even tho as a result of applying semi-realistic characteristics to tanks and stuff some units are just too useless to call-in, amount of options is really big for each faction. Even tho, as example, for soviets you will usually get something like some infantry, dshk, zis and then if everything is good you will wait for t34/57 or get that funny howitzer-tin coffin-tank thing that's at lvl 10 or something, or t60, things that you can do with spetznaz with stolen bazooka and flamethrower guy are lewder than most kinky porn. Also when was the last time you saw flamethrowers actually burning everyhing inside of a tank? Games like Company of Jobbers 2 will always shield themselves with some non-existant "MUH BALANCE" holy cow, but in reality Relic just dont know how things work and can't code if their life depended on it.\n\nManual aim: this is plain fun, even though it seems tanks ironically actually lose in accuracy if you manually aim them. If you remember Crimsonland - when you control soldier with PTRs and noscope360 enemies through covers it feels just like this. However, while you having fun you will probably lose rest of the army because i didn't find anything resembling CONTROL GROUPS IN THIS GAME AND WORKING WITH THIS MINIMAP REQUIRES 900+ APM.\n\nLittle things: A lot of things here are just priceless: manually refilling artillery ammunition with infantry squad by moving shells from a truck through inventory (if you played a lot of Zuma at MLG tournaments you will be good at this), shooting cow and then search it's corpse, kill a guy, stuff his corpse's inventory with artillery shells and then move it near your artillery like some sort of death metal treasure chest, throw grenade into trench and then order machinegun to fire at position so enemy won't ever escape, run your flamethrower tank through building filled with enemies, ram enemy fortifications and then detonate it with grenade to see most useless fireworks ever, roll out IS-3 and lose it to one-shot from enemy AT, etc.\n\nI give this game 100 executed war prisoners out of 100. Even though interface and matchmaking are modern means of mental torture, game itself is pure fun. As for singleplayer missions - they don't seem to be as much fun as they were in very first Men of War so i never tried them.\n\nWin for the Rodina or die trying!","November 14, 2014","true","35.8"," 83 of 119 people (70%) found this review helpful 31 people found this review funny","70","83","119","31","3"

The lag and the inability to fix it since it's release is mindboggling. See strat29's comments.\n\nEdit: The game has been updated since early October however the update has not drastically changed the game to differentiate it enough from Assault Squad 1 (AS1). It has fixed the lag issue for the most part but it seems rather strange that the game was originally launched with such a blatant, arguably unplayable issue in the first place. There are no new factions, very few new maps, inability to play the large maps (8x8 for example) and a game that essentially replicates what AS1 does. Worth a buy? Maybe. Worth the supposed upgrade from AS1? Nope.\n\nEdit #2 (Version 3.115.0): In the last few weeks a new update and new features via a DLC were issued through steam. They've ironed out some of the issues that plagued the game since the latest series of updates but the game still has some relatively large issues that continute plague performance and multiplayer gameplay. If you're relatively new to this game and you're looking to experience multiplayer and ultimately test out your strategies, you may not have that great of a time. While many players will experience the following, it is new and casual players who will experience the following in a more frustrating fashion. Multiplayer is not "smooth", in fact many have complained it is essentially broken. Crashing (out of sync, random black screens, random dropping) is very common. Second, lag is an issue, period. Whether the lag issue is due to bad PC performance or latency issues, it is a problem for many. Third, multiplayer often requires you to connect with other players and form regular teams which can and is often frustrating for new and casual players (although I'm quite fine :)).\n\nA few more notes on the latest series of updates:\n- No 8v8.... yet?\n- Replay via the DLC is great but arguably a tad expensive considering what you get. Plus the replay feature does not have any control functions like pause, fast-forward, etc. Further, it is bugged.\n- Spectator slots are a great addition but it is also bugged and likely causes out-of-syc crashing issues.\n- Steam overlay is all messed up. The latest updates have rendered it useless which is a step backwards and quite surprising that it was not looked at before the release.\n- This company seems to think it's cool release release notes several days after an  update.\n\n\nI can definitely understand why new and casual players find the multiplayer aspect of this game frustrating. Not only is there a steep learning curve, it has a number of other issues which I noted. I should also note that the overall gameplay is still not better than AS1.\n\nEdit #3 (Version 3.122) as of May 23rd, 2015: This game has been updated several times since I last looked over my review of this game. I would like to note the following:\n\n- SOME Out-of-Sync in-game crashing has been fixed but it still occurs enough to delay a 2v2 tournament and was the direct cause of cancelling the 3v3 league (which I assisted in administering).  It is a MAJOR sore spot in the competitive part of the community.\n\n- Replays still crash as much as before.\n\n- I began a campaign for new maps to be implemented in a future version given this game's focus is primarily on multiplayer. I hope this is done because this game has lacked new, quality maps ever since it's release. I have no idea why this didn't cross their minds before hand... It now appears DMS may very well be including it in a future paid DLC pack, which if true, is a joke given that the maps they're reviewing are available FREE as a MOD (unfortunately too many AS2 players are ignorant of this).\n\n- Performance issues still exist (lag, PC performance). Still worse than AS1 in terms of performance.\n\n- Steam overlay is still completely broken, about a year since it's release.\n\n- Matchmaking, I finally tried it. It's been plagued with issues from day one, no end in sight. It is also not taken seriously, at all, by us in the competitive community.\n\n\nEdit #4 (Latest version as of July 16th, 2015): It's been almost two months since I updated this review to outline the latest version(s) so I'd like to note a few things:\n\n- Many people still play this game, albeit the singleplayer part of this game. Unfortunately this game, as all RTS games, is geared towards multiplayer. With that being said, the crashes I've noted early, among a new crash since the end of May and the out-of-sync errors that still occur have really hurt two communities: the more experienced modders and modding community and the competitive community. As of three weeks ago I stopped playing due to the sheer amount of errors in multiplayer and overall instability in the game's performance.\n\n- DMS has struggled to provide a smooth, stable multiplayer ever since it's release. I've been cautiously optimistic and hopeful but I've decided to move on generally and wish everyone good luck playing the game. Out-of-sync issues has decimated larger multiplayer games and as I've noted, the competitive side of the community. It's virtually impossibly to play consistent, stable 2v2, 3v3 and up games. With that being said, It's a game that I truly enjoyed but it's become too unstable to continue forwards.","September 29, 2014","false","300.9"," 40 of 52 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","40","52","0","4"

It's extremelly hard to find a game, relating to how it feels like it's still a beta. It has a XP System which completely ruined the games experience, the community is way to small for something like an XP System also. There aren't to many missions for all of the factions (Which is currently at 3 factions still), they may be some what long but they are all literally the same missions for each faction showing an extreme lack of effort and laziness. The path finding from the AI can be good at most times but you will constantly find times of your AI acting like idiots (causing them to get kill and completely ruin your strategy) I've never actaully wanted a refund for a game until now, which is saying a lot because I own a good amount of COD games.

Theres no real story like previous men of war games (unlike the first assault squad which also had no story). Their is 6 or 7 missions for each faction, brits, germans, russians etc. Nearly every single map is the same, a long corridor which you must advance up and take control of the flags. There is no room for flanking, no room for any tactical depth, its basically direct control one unit and slowly advance him up taking out everything. Occasionally something different will happen, like you need to defend the flag for X amount of time. Its hardly stimulating tactically for example the start of the first mission it gives you 1 squad of infantry to defend against an attack, you literally do not have to issue a single order, your men will sit in the trench and return fire for 3 minutes until it progress' onto the corridor style level layout. Its pointless, you may aswell just speed up time to get it out of the way.\n\nSome of the missions are even dlc missions that were released for the first men of war. So ive paid for the exact same maps twice now.\n\nHere is the real stinker though. Youve completed all the missions for the nation that you chose to play as first, time to try out some of the other nations! Wait ... this map looks awfully familiar ....oh thats right, it is! The other nations are all carbon copies of the same maps just reskinned to look different with the units of that nation put in instead. Dont get me wrong they look quite nice the maps but there is only so many times you can advance up the same corridor of a map with the tiniest of differences between them.\n\nIn essence the only saving grace is the community workshop, which is sad that your relying on user generated content to enjoy a game you paid for. It is truely a sad state of affairs that the game which started this series off "Soldiers heroes of ww2" released over 10 years ago had more complex missions, a better story and more varied missions than this. I do not think this title warrants calling itself a sequel to assault squad 1, its pretty much the same game but better graphics.\n\nPerhaps the multiplayer is the saving grace of this series, i dont know. But like me if your interested in singleplayer missions, avoid this unless some really good steam workshop stuff comes out. Play the original men of war, faces of war or even soldiers heroes of ww2 instead they are all vastly superior singleplayer experiences.\n\nShame, i was hoping for more after assault squad one, not more of the same.","May 16, 2014","false","38.9"," 34 of 44 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","34","44","0","0"

In terms of the core game mechanics and gameplay then you will be somewhat satisfied as these remain true as the original. However in terms of graphical fidelity then this is a great letdown. If anything this game is just a slight graphical update upon the original and I would not recommend you buy this game... yet. All that has happened is there has been integration with steam and thats about it. So I wouldn't throw your money at this title quite yet.","May 16, 2014","false","2.3"," 35 of 46 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","35","46","0","1"

My hopes were not high, reading the features that were going to be in this game before release, but I am disappointed, nonetheless.\n\nIf you enjoyed Assault Squad 1, and want to continue playing that game online, you're practically forced into buying Assault Squad 2, as the imminent demise of Gamespy means that the multiplayer in the previous Men of War titles will soon be defunct. The switch from Gamespy server to Steam server has not been a graceful one either, navigating from menu to menu in the internet menus takes a lot longer than it used to. Previously, joining a server rarely took longer than a second, now on the steam servers, it regularly takes upwards of 10 just to connect. Global chat has been replaced by a steam chat channel that requires you to use the steam overlay, or have it open on a separate window entirely, and you can no longer see another player's game information (games played, won, quit, etc), now the info button just brings you to their steam achievements page. Hopefully the steam servers mean that everyone will stay on the same version number, which was a previous issue.\n\nThe UI has been changed in a few ways. For vehicles, the icons are more or less the same, just stacked horizontally as well as vertically, but for infantry, the icons have become much smaller. It was hard to tell what units were what at first because there's nothing to explain it, but on my own I learned that a red line above the infantry icon denotes an AT launcher in the squad, and a yellow line above the icon denotes an AT rifle. I suppose this is inoffensive but contrasted with the background, it's hard to see how many infantry units are in a given squad.\n\nUnit-wise, almost nothing has changed, except many cannon ranges has been decreased by about 10m. You can order “elite” units of some infantry (Machinegunners, AT teams) which is the same composition plus or minus one squad member with higher weapon skill. All infantry seem to have higher stealth ratings, for better or worse.\n\nThere are many more maps than there were previously, thankfully, some of which are from the DLC of the previous game, but I believe some of them are new.\n\nNow the 3 damning points about this game that make it not worth 30$\n\n1. No bugs to my knowledge have been fixed, every glitch you can think of is still in the game, and the game still crashes with no notice.\n2. The unlock system. This system is so amazingly out of place in Men of War, there's no other word for it but insulting. Units are locked until you reach a specific level. If you're a veteran Men of War player, this means that until you reach the required level, which can take tens of games, you get no artillery, no super heavy tanks, and a handful of other units. This is so baffling as to why they would even think of putting this system in this game. There are only two possibilities in my mind, why a company would put this in a game, either to make the game more like Company of Heroes, the much more popular WWII real time stratege/tactics game, or more cynically, just so that they can sell their deluxe edition of AS2, which increases exp rewards, unlocking things faster. The host can unlock all units on a per-game basis, but locking units based on individual player experience (not skill), is just a waste of time.\n3. It's 30$ (or more) for the same game, with no fixes, very few unit changes, vague improvements that don't have much of an impact at all, and an unbelievably insulting unlock gimmick.\n\nI think everything in this game must have been planned as DLC or update content for AS1, and they decided to slap a new title and a full price (the same price AS1 has been at for years) so that they could charge everybody for DLC instead of just the people who would have bought DLC anyway. A solution for this would have been to offer a much more generous discount to the people who owned it, because if you own AS1 and the DLC for it,  you practically own a better version of AS2, just one that won't be playable online in a few weeks.\n\nThanks DMS.","May 18, 2014","false","166.6"," 37 of 50 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","37","50","0","2"

The game is both fun and challenging, with an added educational aspect with the inclusion of units, vehicles, and weapons of which may help you gain a better understating of their roles in the second world war.\n\nWhat's new?:\nAn entirely  new feature to Assault Squad 2 is the soldiers now gather experience for their actions, increasing their effectiveness on the battle field, whereas previously long standing soldiers would run out of ammo and may become deadweight, or a micro management calamity. Ammo boxes and supply trucks now generate a field to resupply soldiers and weapons in the nearby vicinity, making it easier to manage your units, particularly in heated or drawn-out engagements.\n\nFeatures:\nOne feature of the MOW series worth mentioning is the game speed control function, the ability to scale several different speeds during the game is a great feature. It is particularly useful for micro managing things such as soldiers inventory, mine laying, vehicle/weapon repair and the use of medics. It is also very helpful to players new to the game, and also to just observe the action in slow motion close up.\n\nAssault Squad 2 has mod support, with an in game menu to activate/de-activate them as you please, as well as a Steam workshop, where you can download mods with the click of a button, no messy installations or file overwrites. What gives the game increased longevity is the modding community, they allow you to expand on your experience and add new scenarios, some of which even exceed the games original campaign.\n\nVerdict:\nAlthough the game is not 100% finished, the graphics and textures are improved, but visually is not especially different to the previous titles, at this point the levels for all factions are quite similar for each campaign, and the stealth missions are a bit redundant.\n\nIf you are new to the MOW series, or are a fan of them, then I would recommend Assault Squad 2. If you have played early titles such as Assault Squad 1 and it did not leave you wanting more, than this may not be for you, or you may just want to wait for it to go on special to try for yourself.\n\nAt the end of the day one must remember that this is a game, made for entertainment, and games differ from reality, if you want reality then simply head outside.

It falls into a special one\n\nNow, when I first heard that they'll be releasing a MoW2 with Steam Intergration I was excited until I saw the price and notice that not many things changed. Paying ~$35 for the same thing is not really a good thing so I decided to buy on sale which I did. And from what I've experienced thus far, thank goodness I bought it from the sale.\n_______________________________________\n\nGameplay\n--------------------------------------------------------------\nAt it's core, MOWAS 2 is a 'what if' Company Of Heroes 2 had much more micromangement and detail involved without the base building and includes mechanics such as managing an individuals soldier, tank or artillery inventory and even ASSUMING CONTROL of them when needed to fine tune your orders such as timing a cooked grenade toss or aiming a specific part of the target etc.\n\nArmoured Warfare in this game puts CoH2's to shame because of how each (and there's a lot) and every Tank has seperate parts which can be neutralized to decommision a tank such as destroying its mobility with a shot to its track or destroying its main gun so that it can no longer fire. Note that they can be repaired should the inventory of the tank or crew have a spare repair kit. The way tanks are destoyed in this game is also amazing as tanks do not have health but instead, rely on their armour thickness and the direction from which the AT fire came from (did it hit from a sloped angle or the rear? etc) so you won't see funny things like a Stuart destroying a King Tiger.\n\nThe gameplay in this game is solid and rather in-depth which is the main reason why I enjoy this game so much.\n_______________________________________\n\nSingle Player\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNothing too interesting here. 7-ish missions for each of the 5 factions which are basically reskins of one another. Luckily, there are mods that add interesting scenarios and SP (or Co-op) missions of their own.\n\nHowever, Single Player Co-Op has this weird mechanic where person A can buy a Tank but the game decides to give said Tank to person B because he has a smaller army count. In addition, buying a 8-man squad can end up becoming a 2-man squad as a result of this mechanic. Though units can be given away to other players, for a game that has players speaking many languges, trying to share these units can be a hard unless playing with a friend in which case it's only a minor annoyance.\n\nSP can be fun though doing the same thing over and over again can get boring unless you use mods by individuals such as Sir Hinkel.\n_______________________________________\n\nMultiplayer\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAlongside the weird 'sharing units in Single Player campaign' thingy, multiplayer also has a weird mechanic which although can be turned off in an unranked lobby by the host, it cannot be turned off in ranked matches, period.\n\nBasically, its a levelling system. If I'm not mistaken, the maximum level that one can achieve is around 20 if not more. At level 20, you can purchase any units during a ranked game. At level 1 which most people start as off, you can only purchase half the units at your disposal. Basically, your low level is preventing you from making any expensive yet powerful purchases such as Elite Infantry Units, Heavier Tanks and Heavy Artillery support including half of your special faction troops being locked.\n\nHow does 1 increase their level? Two ways. Either they play (and finish) more ranked matches or play through the SP campaign either alone or with a friend.\n\nThis levelling system is in my opinion, extremely flawed for players attempting to get their feet wet in ranked multiplayer. Aside from some toxic players which most game have, going against a level 20 opponent when you're simply level 1 offers the new player a huge disadvantage for them and removes the fun for him as he will basically get rofl stomped by superior equipment. In addition to this, most players who I've met in a ranked game tend to have double digit levels while I'm still level 3 and I fail to see how this create a valid and fair leaderboard let alone match when high level players are always going up against lower tier players such as myself. To me, this seems downright broken and makes ranked matches unplayable until I've played a countless number of SP missions for a game that emphasizes on Multiplayer. This mechanic is such a major turnoff that I regret buying this game, even though it was during a deal UNLESS players start getting paired against similarly ranked or levelled players.\n\nOne thing that this game has done to avoid players from dropping is by forcing you to finish a game by removing any form of concede button where only your ELO is affected. Instead, even when outnumbered in a 2v1, 4v2 or any other match where you've lost everything, leaving a game midway will do three things instead. Decrease your ELO, degrades your Ranked Trust Rating and finally, Negates you from earning any EXP you gained from that match neccessary to level up your army. And mind you the levels are factions specific. You can have a level 4 Germany army but a level 1 UK army.\nSo, do players finish a losing game where they get absolutely zero enjoyment because of getting owned hard? No, they don't. They either cut their internet connection, desync the game or simply use Task Manager to close it. Through this,  there would be no changes for their ELO, trust rating or EXP earned.\n_______________________________________\n\nStability\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe stability for this game is poor. Playing with Local friends won't even mitigate the issue as I still get kicked out of a game even if said friend was living around my neighbourhood. The most notorious one of them all is the 'Out-Of-Sync' Error.\n\nThis error freezes your game and happens at random intervals and can get very frustrating as it will not record down the online game you spent 45-60 minutes playing. Error dc:x are also annoying.\nFrom what I've gathered, Error dc:0 = the host kicked you mainly due to your ping which is a joke considering that only PC Performance matters while Error dc:3 which is basically the game being a jerk to you.\n\nKeep in mind that this game was in EARLY ACCESS for a couple of months and after its release on April/May 2014, it still gets this kind of problems which is downright unacceptable considering how long of a chance they had to fix this. Heck, the developers are even releasing another EARLY ACCESS game which appears to be MOWAS with a Modern Era reskin somewhere this year which means there goes the technical support for the game.\n\nConclusion\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGood game, great gameplay, great mechanic. Poor Ranked Multiplayer. Horrendous Stability\n\nAnd as MOWAS 2 is a multiplayer orientated game whose only major difference from its predecessor is Steam Intergration with the price of ~$40, I can't recommend this game to anyone unless its on sale.\n\n~Edited due to Stability issues","January 6, 2015","false","107.5"," 83 of 131 people (63%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","63","83","131","6","2"

The graphics and effects look really nice but can be a drain if the system is getting on a bit, so be warned before cranking it up to ultra!

It has stepped up and offers outstanding graphics compared to the original. (The dirt is so beautiful)\n2.)  The AI is human-like and fluctuates on its reactions as the battelfield changes. (Hiding in impact craters, using tank husks as cover)\n3.)  It offers a few new maps (as far as the Beta is concerned). It also has a few old ones.\n4.)  All the sounds, music, and textures are recycled from the original.\nThat's about it in regards to being different to MoW: AS\n\nThe second part of this review will be to describe the MoW experience to those that have yet to play this game.\n\n1.)  The game is brutal, and unforgiving. (not your typical RTS) You must use your resources wisely as you only get so much and to recover mistakes mid game is almost impossible.\n2.)  This game stresses on hardcore realism in regards to bullet penetration and physics. (Tank rounds will bounce off certain tanks and shred others.)\n3.)  If your infantry is not in cover, they are already dead. (Tactical placement of infantry is the key to victory.)\n4.)  This game is basically as real as war can get.\n5.)  If you press down your Ctrl key you are able to manually control and operate any unit. (This is a big plus to the RTS genre.)\n\n\nAll in all it is a decent game, however for the fans of the original, you may be disappointed with this new release as it has little to no changes gameplay-wise.

The game, just like its predecesors, has a bit of a learning curve with it. The rewards of learning can be of a great benefit and makes the game a whole lot more fun.\n\nNow lets talk about the single player aspect first before the multiplayer. The single player portion of the game is pretty good, with four difficulty levels ranging from easy to hard, and you can tell the difference from easy being a cake walk to hard... being just about impossible unless you know every little thing there is to know about the game. But man, can it be incredibly fun. You have five different factions to choose from with several skirmish missions to try for each. Each faction has thier own style making each one very unique to the other. You can play all of these missions by yourself or together on multiplayer. With single player you can pause the game, slow down the speed, or even speed things up. There are a few mods out there that can really spice the game up as well, which can be played by both single or mulitplayer.\n\nThe multiplayer is possible the only bad thing about this great game. The community is very small and many games that are hosted are either locked by passwords, or your kicked as soon as you enter the lobby. This can make you spend hours just trying to find or create a game instead of playing it. Every blue moon you might actually find a decent group of players who like to play the game for fun and not competitively to the point where they kick you becuase your rank is to low or to high.\n\nWhen you do get a game you may find that it sometimes lags pretty bad. The ping can be horrendous at times even with just 2 people, but then again you can find a game where there is no sign of lag at all, even with a group of 8 people! The games themselves mostly rely on a individual's own internet connection and not a dedicated server.\n\nThe multiplayer is actually a lot of fun if you can find a group or have a few friends that like to play, but going in alone with the community thats on right now is terrible. The multiplayer was one of the main factors for me getting this game in the first place, and im sadly disappointed by the outcome.\n\nIf you don't care for the multiplayer portion or have a group of friends to play with on here, then its a great game that i recommend buying, but if multiplayer is a big deal, then you better pass up on this until something changes with the community thats on right now. It is really a shame.","July 13, 2015","false","263.4"," 29 of 39 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","29","39","0","0"

It isn't looking good. The game looks like a direct copy of its predecessor in looks and gameplay and i personally definitely hope this is a NEW game not a copy of the old game with some added maps. As far as i see it needs work. Yes, it's in beta. But i see no evidence of any new features of anything significantly impressive about the '2' in the game. You can play the two side by side and hadly be able to tell the difference between them. Except that this second version's maps are broken and the AI can be a lot stupider than before. It looks and plays fine on difficulties easy and normal. But is lacking the realistic aspect this game is going for when you play on expert mode. Bushes do not give you cover and the enemy AI have aim that you can only beat when you take direct control of a unit. As im going through the game this is my initial opinion based on the completion of the first campaign. I have high hopes and i love the first Men of War. But when they released a sequal i was hoping for something better. Like maybe more focus on the Vietnam era? Or the Korean War? As the second world war seems to very extremely overdone. But no matter what i will always buy and play the sequals to any Men of War title as it's an amazing game overall. As of now, if you are interested in the game buy it now while it's on sale and enjoy it when they start shelling some patches. But if you want the buy this game as a newcomer of the Men of War games go for the first game as it's a lot more fun and enjoyable.\n\nEDIT: 2:18 PM One hour later\nGame ended up crashing on me a few times midway into a mission. sequence error. Ive seen people having this problem constantly as well in the reviews including the one that the developer team deleted themselves. Which out of context, i think that review had been pretty honest and the developers' flagging response did seem pretty petty. But otherwise this game has many more errors now that i see. And it still is the same game as before. Same mission plots as well. Such as Germany Mission 1. A defence mission exactly like MoW 1 US mission 3 where you defend the Phillipines. Which by the way has an INFAMOUS history of crashing. The Phillipines on MoW 1 was unplayable in multiplayer. Which brings me to suggest you may need to readvise how you put together your defending missions, as of right now the reveiw is still for people to wait until buying this game if they want the full experience.\n\nEDIT 2/25 8:02 PM 24 Hrs of gameplay\nI enjoy the game and it's a great game. Still do not recommend to people who are just getting into the men of war games. But one thing i definitely keep in heart is "If you want to have the best possible Men of War experience we strongly recommend to wait for the full game. Playing the beta is at your own risk and you will very likely encounter issues that are not present in the final version." From the developers news of the people preordering getting open beta access. I agree 100% and i definitely appreciate the honesty because it basically can sum up my review, being wary that it is a beta, but one thing i would like to reiterate is the fact that they need to make sure it has a significant difference in gameplay or AI rather than something people can claim to be a 'copy and paste' game.\n\nEDIT 2/25 12:21 AM\nGame is finished, Looks good, Plays good, But i still say that you should buy the first one and play through it first. As in my opinion it is better, and or the same exact game. If you already have the first one. Definitely buy this, specially if it goes up for sale.\n\nEDIT: 7/16/2015 1:34 AM\nThey're releasing overly priced DLCs to make up for the fact that the game was an exact copy of the first game even still. Yes i love Assault Squad. But i disagree with the cash grabs that the developers are choosing to go through with. I have to pay $9.99 to have a feature that should have been in the base game. AI players? Third person mode? Base game tanks? MORE singleplayer missions? PLEASE stop trying to take my money and give me a game I will enjoy and continue to play even past it's time. I sure hope the developer comes to their senses and stops charging people for features that belong in the base game.\n\nMy OVERALL opinion. Don't buy this game. Buy the much mroe completed first version for cheaper, and if you like that version, invest in this second version because this still remains to be a large DLC of the first game.","February 22, 2014","false","200.3"," 108 of 178 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","108","178","0","2"

I have a particular love for RTS games, and found the original Men of War Assault Squad to be very fun to play, if a little on the shallow side for graphics, optimization, and a terrible AI system. With AS2 promising to fix all these, it seemed like a good idea at the time.\n\nNeedless to say, I was very disappointed with it. I haven't logged too much time into this game because not only have the graphics barely improved aside from what seems to be better graphics quite literally MIXED IN with the older, crappy graphics at random (first mission of soviets, nuff said), it's now poorly optimized to the point that my hex-core 3.5 ghz computer with 64 gigs of ram and twin GTX titans will lag and, if it isn't lagging and actually running a solid 60 fps, FREEZE every few seconds for about a second. The UI is exactly the same as before, the AI is still not AI in my opinion as scripts should not count, and I was greeted with a lazy menu that used the same music and style of the previous game! The in-game music is the same too, voice acting has barely improved and only in CERTAIN areas, and on top of that the game pulled a stunt going from beta to early access without more than 1 day's notice. The only area that seems to have improved in a truly useful way is the multiplayer, which now uses steam instead of an external service, as well as steam workshop support for easy access to mods and maps, which I will give it credit for adding - these are much needed to this game and all games in general as Gamespy is going down and workshop just increases replayability of ANY title massively and will likely lead to me playing this game quite a bit more to enjoy workshop content.\n\nI am not saying the men of war series of games are bad, because they are very fun to play. I am saying that this game should not be counted as a sequel to the first game - it is at best an expansion (with the majority of its content being from AS1), and does not live up to what I had expected in the slightest from this title as a full on sequel at the full price of a sequel.","April 17, 2014","false","4.2"," 29 of 39 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","29","39","0","0"

They have some qualities that I think set them apart from other competing WW2 games. This is to CoH2, for example, what ARMA III is to Metal Slug - except it's fun! The realism does not ruin it.\n\nThe reason I am NOT recommending it is very simple - nothing has changed! Really, nothing has changed at all! The menu is identical, the sound is identical, almost everything is identical. I actually feel very, very cheated by this - it's actually quite insulting.\n\n1) The voice acting is identical, and seeing as it has been used since Faces of War, I'm starting to get a little tired of it. This feels very very lazy.\n\n3) The graphics engine does not look anything like the screenshots - in fact, it looks virtually identical to the graphics engine from Men of War AS I. I honestly cannot tell the difference, and I have a computer that can run it on full, easily.\n\n4) In order to use units in MP, you have to level up (by playing multiplayer games over a period of time) - meaning, of course, that the best get better and the worst get trashed. You can disable this option, but you have to go into the advanced settings, meaning that many people will overlook this option\n\n5) It is still very, very buggy. Frequent crashes to desktop.\n\n6) 8v8 games? No. No no, there are 8v8 maps, but you can't actually PLAY with 16 players - you can only put 8 players on. Who wants to play 4v4 on an 8v8 size map?\n\n7) The netcode is still atrocious. Good luck finding a large game that runs properly. If a single person in the game has a sluggish computer, it will slow down the entire server for the remaining players. Framerates plummet to the point of unplayability. In fact, I would say that only 25% of the games I have played even play "playably".\n\nIn the end, you have to kick an enormous amount of people with either terrible computers or terrible internet connections. I blame the game for part of this.\n\nI'm not sorry I bought this game, especially as I got it reduced, but this feels like a massive cash grab from a lazy company. Which is a shame, because they do know how to make an excellent RTS; or at least, they did once - they've just been re-releasing it for the previous five or so years.\n\nCould do better!\n\n(P.S. Half the players in this game are apparently Nazis ("S.S. PzDiv" in their name, pictures of Einsatzgruppen on their steam profile) - the other half seem to want the Soviet Union back.)","April 30, 2014","false","7.9"," 28 of 38 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","28","38","0","0"

Being that Assault Squad 2 should not be considered as a new game more like an add-on, expansion or update. if you have Assault Squad 1 play it instead because there's so little that was added only like 5 co-op maps. Now with that out of the way I love WW2 games and the Men of War series as well so the people that do not have Assault Squad 1 I say buy this "new game" MOW is one of the best WW2 RTS ever. What was added that i have seen fixes, some maps, steam worckshop, texture updates, (not much of one) audio update, explosions look better, new co-op game play 1 map for each nation (5) and some i can't think of or not worth adding.

I am, however and unfortunately, extremely disappointed to say the least.\n\nHaving not played MOWAS in a few months, I found it near impossible to actually tell this was supposed to be a different game; graphically, feature-wise and gameplay-wise it is identical to its predecessor, with the same game modes, same copy-pasted maps, same voice acting, same units -- everything is, effectively, the same. Rather than enjoying a new game with fresh new features, some kind of gameplay innovation or even simply new units, I found myself playing the same game I'd played two years ago when the first MOWAS was released.\n\nI can not stress enough not to bother purchasing this game. It contains a couple of new maps, but they are bland and follow the same formula as the previous game; everything else is identical, or of a pointless enough nature to be indistinguishable.

Yes it does lack of great voice acting in singleplayer campaign, but at least present us a actual story line but not this kind of "general thank goood you have arrrrived" thing. It's just lame.\nI suggest anyone who is new to this franchise stick with original Men of war; MoW: Red Tidd; MoW: vietnam. Even Condemned Heroes were better than this.

The game had been advertised as a pre-order for a sequel to their first Assault Squad game with a lot of promised features. Myself and many other players purchased this pre-order under the assumption that DMS intended to meet this expectation. In order to be brief, DMS has fallen very short of their advertisement. They even went as far to change their game type from pre-order to "Early Access" when they failed to meet their release date twice. Suffice to say, we the customers are very upset and wish to share our disgust. The developers at DMS have chosen to bring on a community manager who makes it his business to completely remove any/all comments posted which even hints at disappointment in their decision to change the game to being "Early Access" at the last second. They have even began censoring all comments, reviews, or chat, that expresses any dissatisfaction in their product at all! Please take an administrative interest in the AS2 Steam forum. Like I said, many customers like myself feel that it is completely unethical for DMS to exercise this level of censorship. We are justified in being dissatisfied and have an obligation to voice this dissatisfaction to deter DMS from completely ostracizing the AS2 community.  DMS is clearly showing a complete lack in ability to plan and execute the launch of their new product, including proper risk mitigation.  It's a wonder that 1C can continue to support their fly-by-night software development practices.  This game barely has all the features that the first game had and is extremely glitchy and unplayable.

If you've ever wondered how a King Tiger provoked nothing but terror, what a Bofors cannon would do to a village, or how the MG-42 ambushed it's prey, well this game's for you. It's as graphically stunning as it is enlightening. I've learned more about mid century warfare from this game than any predecessor.  The amount of tools and tanks you get at your disposal leaves nothing to desire. Learn how mortars and MGs compliment each other and utilize single soldiers at the touch of a key.\n\nIn this game there is "no god" or little to no random number generating. If you don't like how a unit is performing hit a key and micromanage it to victory. Hammer windows with high explosive tank rounds and push into crippled landscapes with your wily storm troopers.\n\nThe games not at fault, the hick-ups lie in the animations and AI. These should not deter your purchase. This game is striving for the moon in realism. It's essentially a WW2 sandbox with a decent campaign and extremely fun multiplayer.\n\nWhen you Play Men of War: Assault Squad 2 you feel as tho you can relate to Rommel. The struggle is real.

Just look for sales on the Net. Those games come with highly recommended mods, so make sure you look for them.  AS2 has very limited new content: it has all AS1 missions, plus  3 new missions (3 same scripts copied and pasted 5 times over to make an illusion of 15 new missions).\n\nI didn't buy this game for new content, but because I wanted to play MP. If you are into PvP, then I would recommend waiting until they (1.) fix performance because it is very laggy and frustrating; (2)  fix matchmaking, which is easily exploitable, unbalanced due to unfair progression system and played on many unfair maps.  Pls, ask about performace and matchmaking on the forum before buying this game.\n\n\n\nIn terms of gameplay,  I would say it is not bad but it failed to improve upon AS1. Shorter ranges and changed penetration values made lots of units less useful, if not useless, esp. light armoured TDs. What really affects gameplay are maps. Ranked maps lack consistency: intead of reducing player count for each map systematically, they decided to make, for example, Urban Garden playable for 1v1s and 2v2s. Moreover, 2v2 maps range from tiny maps like Tramwayz  or Urban Garden to very big  like Lakeland or Town. Maps badly need more steamlining. We only got  7 new MP maps: one 1x1, two 2x2 and four 3x3 or 8x8 depending on the mode you play. Good news is that they are not bad.\nAnother thing that seems to help with gameplay is new interface.  I find the new interface a bit better and I like the smg, rifle and MG icons for infantry. Double clicking on one unit will select same units within camerea view. But the grenade/TNT timers are aweful.\n\nAll in all, I recommend patience. We've been waiting for this game to get fixed for 6 months now. So there is no telling when the dream patch will come out. But when it comes out, I hope to see you in the battefield, because well-matched games on  good maps can be really exciting.","June 18, 2014","false","801.3"," 20 of 28 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","20","28","0","0"

Why? Let me tell You all about it.\nPros:\n\n*In this game - Your choices actually matter. Outcome of the battle can change very quickly depending on Your commands - having even twice as much infantry units can mean nothing if they are pushed forward against tanks or HMGs - unlike in CoH (Company of Heroes franchise) there are no heroes here - that means You can't just take a lot of infantry and push them directly to the heart of the battle and suspect them to succeed easily, because if they are away from cover - they are dead. Or likely to become in mere moments.\n\n*Balanced armies - You get what You pay. In this game You won't find a cheap unit that is too hard to deal with - all vehicles die quickly against right anti-armour tools, meaning the light units will explode instantly if hit by high caliber weapons. More expensive units mostly have longer range, slightly better armour, but still have to be used carefully.\n\n*Partial realism - this game tries to be as realistic as possible and still be fun to play.\n\nNow let's get to the ugly part.\nCons:\n\n* A.I. is horrible. Some units commit suicide if left unchecked - they might flip themselves over some obstacle and explode. Other units will take worst possible route. Others will not obey Your commands the first time they get them.\n\n*Graphics are bad. Not very bad, but can be better - now they look like something from 2009.\n\n* Hard to learn to play - there are a lot of things to discover in this game. There's so much of them, it's almost impossible, because there are almost no in-game ability descriptions.\n\nConclusion:\nIf You got bored by CoH franchise - give this game a shot. You will probably like it a lot. Some aspects of MoW:AS2 are so good, they beat CoH! But there are many of flaws too, Imperfect, yet fun and very unique.","August 23, 2015","true","22.4"," 27 of 41 people (66%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","66","27","41","5","0"

On the same graphics level as the original MoW: AS, it somehow manages to run worse. In the original MoW: AS, I managed to make 40+ FPS on Medium. In this, I can make perhaps 10-15 on the lowest of all settings, somehow still looking far worse than MoW: AS. It seems to have traded my frames for a /shiny/ interfacy and oh-so-fancy squad icons.\n\nSecondly, the AI 'improvements' are actually downgrades. I am serious. I have seen my guys go into battle with no ammo in their weapns despite having an inventory full of it. They don't seem to see the need to reload until they are half a meter from the enemy. There is also no option to reload them for the selected unit, when there used to be. It was valuable.\n\nUnits seem to have epileptic fits trying to target opjects and move around, whilst vehicle turn in circles whilst trying to pathfind around bushes. 'look into' and 'target' commands for infantry takes seconds to register, while the AI for the enemy launches precision-guided grenades and wields sniper Submachineguns, neither of which you shall ever be able to repeat.\n\nSoldiers hop out of cover and stand in the open at the slightest provication, and refuse to lay down on the damned ground when the 'stance' button is pressed.\n\nThe maps added are tiny, even for the 8v8 ones, and are something that a beginner to the editor could reproduce in an hour of work. They are also incredibly uninspired: Half of the time, they seem copied wholesale from other maps, whilst half a dozen train tracks were moved elsewhere, and some sandbags added.\n\nThe map view is also seriously wrong. Allies in white? I can't tell where half of them are. And incoming/outgoing fire seems far smaller now, leading to moments of confusion as I try to figure out where any fighting is at.\n\nThe only good thing I can see in this is Steam Workshop support, and even that is pathetic if I can't even play the game correctly.\n\nI feel bad that my friend bought this for me, even if I didn't pay a cent. I also feel bad for every single person who is new to the series who buys this, thinking that 'newer is better'. It's not, and this ain't.\n\nBuy the first game. Hell, buy Men of War: Vietnam... THAT train wreck is better than this. Unless this undergoes quite a few updates to improve optimization, add additional content, and actually MAKE it a new game, I will not be recommending this to any of my friend.\n\nEDIT:\n\nA few months later, I have a few more comments about it.\n\nYou shouldn't even think of buying this sold-as-a-full-game DLC.\n\nDevs are greedy. It's basically the same as Assault Squad one, except you have to unlock units in multiplayer, the AI is more ♥♥♥♥, the game runs terribly, and they have added bots to online... As $10 DLC.\n\nThey have precisely the same levels as the previous one, with a few more tiny, token maps added, ones that are poorly designed in my opinion.\n\nThis is garbage, and I would fully recommend the previous Men of War. Even if you can't do regular online because the Devs didn't bother keeping servers online after Gamespy shut down in order to force people into this, you can at least have fun.","August 17, 2014","false","4.8"," 17 of 23 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","17","23","0","0"

The whole reason for its existence was to be running on a new engine, with the benefits of better performance and visuals. I was willing to accept this as the only real improvement over the previous MoW games, and that honestly would have been enough for me. However, this game runs just as poorly, if not worse than older games, and hardly looks any better. So not only did the performance never change, everything else has been copy-pasted from the old games. I didn't expect a new game, but I expected a playable game. No matter what kind of hardware you have, it runs horribly. You will be lucky to get a constant 30 fps on a Titan. It actually makes the game unplayable for me, and probably for most people.

The whole reason for its existence was to be running on a new engine, with the benefits of better performance and visuals. I was willing to accept this as the only real improvement over the previous MoW games, and that honestly would have been enough for me. However, this game runs just as poorly, if not worse than older games, and hardly looks any better. So not only did the performance never change, everything else has been copy-pasted from the old games. I didn't expect a new game, but I expected a playable game. No matter what kind of hardware you have, it runs horribly. You will be lucky to get a constant 30 fps on a Titan. It actually makes the game unplayable for me, and probably for most people.

So unfortunatly the multiplayer is still quite 'broken' in AS2 compared to predecessors. However they have improved it a lot since launch, for example you can manage to play a least a 2v2 now.\n\nI have always been a huge Men of War fan. I own and played every single Men of War released and never got tired of them. Even when people were dissapointed with Men of War Vietnam I still loved it.\n\nWhen I saw a Men of War Assault Squad 2 coming out I was so excited. I already pumped 400+ hours into the first Assault Squad cause I loved playing it so much. When I got AS 2 and started to play, it was a disaster. The game only adds two or three new units and is a horrible remake of the original Assault Squad. Due to random lag spikes the game is barly playable more than a 3v3 in the multiplayer and lets not even mention the de syncs! Getting disconnected mid game is simply unacceptable for a full fledged game in 2016! With the new implemented idea of units needing to be unlocked once you reach a certain level makes the game unbalanced and unrealistic. Also the graphics are a tad better only for mainstream factions. For example, the Japanese vehicals look like they are ports from Assault Squad 1, same with a few other vehicals in the game, not retextued at all.\n\nI can guarantee this is not worth it's current price. Getting it on sale for $10 or under sure. Nevertheless, it is an alright game game, it has to be because it's the exact same thing as the first one. But overall, I don't know about you guys, but I wouldn't pay $35 for a reskin.\n\nComing to a conclusion, I realize this game is a step in the wrong direction. The unit lock by levels, the auto resupply, the WAY overpriced DLC... it seems DMS is copying the ways of it's rival, Company of Heroes 2. We are loosing what makes the Men of War franchise unique and this game shows it. At least we are not to far gone and can still make a return of the original feeling of Men of War.","August 16, 2014","false","266.1"," 17 of 24 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","17","24","0","0"

It seems like that to play this game properly everyone who runs it should have good performance and connection and even if one player got lags or fps drops - everyone will suffer from it. And from my expirience that happens in every game. And even if you assume it runs OK for everybody you have a game where you have to control a lot of units and the game doesnt offer you enough means to do that like other strategy or tactic games.\nIt might be worth it to get it on -75% sale, but pay the full price for that?

The game was rough, no campaign, just a few single player "skirmish" type missions.  I played the game a bit (atleast a few hours, my time played doesnt reflect the scenario skirmish i played for some reason), and I saw no REAL difference from their earlier games in the series, MoW;AS/etc (oh, besides the missing CAMPAIGN!!!!) and put it down to wait for the full release on the 19th. Today, release date rolls around and ............\n\nEARLY ACCESS status ???? What ?!!!!!!!!!\n\nThis is an outright swindle, I pre-purchased with the impression that the title was to be FULLY RELEASED on the release date, and not into an EARLY ACCESS title.... Why 'pre-purchase' an early access title? There was no warning of this, it was not displayed on the store page, and the cost of the title warranted a COMPLETE/FULL (near AAA) release on release date, not a messed up early access, unfinished pile of trash.  The negative reviews are not represented underneath the title properly when they have many helpful 'clicks' from users.\n\nOh yeah, not to mention the title isnt even ready on the 19th, wow. Early Access on the 20th?\n\nThis purchase is seriously making me re-think ever buying another game on steam, the early access overkill is bad enough, now they have to do NINJA EARLY ACCESSS for $30!!!!. I am definitely never buying nothing from this developer again and probably never buying another non-AAA (and vouched for, released, and reviewed by proper journos) title off steam again.\nI'm going back to pirating peices of trash like this, good job steam/devs/early access theivery.","March 20, 2014","false","0.4"," 34 of 57 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","34","57","0","2"

That being said you're mainly going to be playing mutliplayer, but thats my main problem. The multiplayer in this game has huge balancing issues, and the fact that there is a gigantic lag issue when playing with people. The lag causes your game to drop to around 15 fps and all your troops animations look super choppy as a result. Not to mention this makes direct controll a pain. Also, there are large amounts of exploits in this game making balance even worse. I.e. enemy tank is out of your range so you direct controll your tank and shoot a tree that is infront of your tank and the enemy.  ( dont believe there is a drop off for shell pen btw.) Single player was pretty fun, but I hate this games multiplayer, its espescially hard for new people because no one will put up with or teach them. Normaly your team either leaves you because of it, or starts greifing, etc.\n\nThe pros:\ngood armor pen machanics\nMovements orders are ok, pretty glitchy a lot of times though.\nGood modding community(thats going to mean a lot, the base game is super bland)\nEditor is pretty fun(400 flame throwers vs 20 mg42 machine gunners? Why not!)\nAgain the tanks are really fun to mess with people\nDirect controll is amazingly stupid and funny.(Smg preferably ppsh +at nades= Super Salty enemy)\nFairly competetive mp scene(I dont really like that but some do so im listing it)\nMODS(Yea I know i listed it before)\nGame is pretty fun to play mp or coop with friends(The only friend I played this game with is a ♥♥♥ who hordes all the points to buy troops with btw then complains he has nothing while I cap points with a single guy kek)\n\nFor me this game isnt really worth anywhere near $30, and the fact that this company puts stupid DLC out that doesnt even work. I'd price the game at around $15 being generous. In other words this is just a more broken MOWAS and mp works.","March 27, 2015","false","84.6"," 19 of 29 people (66%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","66","19","29","0","2"

It's good, but bad at the same time. Well, not bad but it does have it's share of flaws. The gameplay is really good, it's very in-depth and tactical, if you ever learn how to play it. There's almost no tutorial at all, you have to go into the controls settings and learn them yourself. The graphics are great, the sound is amazing, and the gameplay is fluid. What it lacks is a good story, a good tutorial and a good singleplayer. Even though most MoW fans mainly play multiplayer, 1C could have stepped it up more on the singleplayer. The story is really dull. Probably the biggest flaw to this game is how similar it is to MoW:AS1, which was an amazing game. It would seem that a game that is similar to it's predecessor would be equally as good, but somehow this is worse. I reccomend it, but MoW:AS1 is just a whole lot better.","December 29, 2014","false","7.7"," 30 of 50 people (60%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","60","30","50","3","0"

This is a copy of the game almost 1: 1, which is not trying to sell as a completely new title! It is therefore self-plagiarism. And although we have a similar feats in the world of games and unfortunately almost wont Shooting from different titles in the RTS, it is really new. Welcome to zero innovation, welcome to Men of War: Assault Squad 2!\n\nLet's therefore good order. The Men of War Assault Squad 2 is not a campaign in the true sense, but here is instead a system similar skirmish battles as in other RTS games. Thus, one can select from five different parties to the conflict WW2. Namely, these are Germany, the United States, the British Empire, the Soviet Union and finally the Japanese empire. It all sounds very good, the choice is really varied, at least ostensibly, but now back to reality.\nMen of War Assault Squad Menu\n\nMission unfortunately are not only similar, but directly consistent with those for the other fraction. Thus, for example, in the first mission for the US must take part of the map, then show prestrihová animation, which will be destroyed by Allied tank and the game will offer you this tank repair and steal it. Lala him in the first mission for the Germans, which, however, takes place during the battle for North Africa there is the same situation and that is, the player conquers the part of the map, then appears prestrihová animation where the tank of your ally destroyed and you will be offered a repair appropriation of this machine. Really great, so that was not enough, some of these maps are taken already from the previous games Men of War Assault Squad, where the first mission in the US was on the same map as the second mission in the Assault Squad 2, namely in Normandy during the D day . I do not now just the same situation, so check out, but the same map with the same layout of buildings, soldiers, and just to all, that copy 1: 1, even with the same voice in speech, the Commander, which gives you the same commands, as in the previous parts!\nMen of War Assault Squad\n\nSo innovative we point zero and even more below. Let's summarize but also other parts of the game. In principle, the game works on the same basis as its predecessor. Thus, the player starts on the map, which is littered with enemy units and always after the conquest of a certain part of the map was made available to the new unit, which the player can call for support. At the beginning of the map is therefore possible to call you only infantry teams, support teams, such as mortars and machine guns, then it is possible to summon support for light vehicles and, ultimately, tanks, or even aviation and artillery salvos. Depending on the selected difficulty is then derives the procedure on these maps, which will make the enemy attacks to have captured points, or the player that was tormented lightning counterattack, respectively. well coordinated offensive. This whole artificial intelligence and the behavior of units is not completely copied already from the first game.\n\nGraphically the game looks almost identical to the previous work and there is no appreciable forward. The only corrections waited icons infantry teams, where orange, or yellow tape over their character sygnalizuje ability to deal with vehicles, so they carry a kind of form of anti-tank weapons, such as. German Panzerschreck or British anti-tank rifle Boys. Yes, this is the only real change from the previous episode! Mowas2 icon\n\nAudio is well and where each faction has dubbed voices and various commands directly under the jurisdiction of their nation. This means that the Germans will speak German, Japanese will again use the Japanese language, and the like. This element, however, there is again no longer from the previous part. Nadôvažok, all voices used in this game are recycled as different from the previous work and even music in the opening menu is identical, respectively. copied from Men of War Assault Squad!\n\nMen of War Assault Squad 2 is a disappointment and a colossal dimensions. Studio, which stands for the development of this game is no great AAA studio subsidized milionovej huge investments of its multi-million publisher, but this is really unforgivable. Selling the same game, with almost zero innovation, copying all files from previous work and selling de facto the same game, just updated to the new build is such a thing unheard of and be ticked off even before it was seizing other studies and other publishers . If you're a fan of strategies and the Second World War, so I prefer to buy the first episode, because Men of War Assault Squad is definitely worth it. If you have not already played or own previous works, so choose carefully if you want to invest a further circa 30 € to its exact copy.","December 16, 2014","false","1.7"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","14","20","0","0"

It could be way better than company of heroes in that its more realistic, focuses more on actual combat, way more variety of units especially tanks, more countries to play as and so on. Unfortunately everytime I play it doesn't take long until I get annoyed and frustrated with it. If the developers can fix some of these issues with the game it will severely improve the experience. Here are my reasons I dislike this game:\n\n1. The vehicle pathfinding is really frustrating. The vehicles will often drive into trees and get stuck, or take the most illogical routes through a village possible.\n2. Tanks are pratically useless. Forget the terrifying panzers feared by allied infantry during ww2, because in this game almost all infantry can just spam attack them with AT grenades and destroy them instantly.\n3. There is no notification that your units are under attack. This always happens to my defended positions. The game doesn't tell you anything, I will often look away for 10 seconds and look back and all my squads are dead.\n4. Smoke grenades are useless. I don't know what their current in game function is but the certainly dont provide cover from enemy machinegunners.\n5. The infantry ai are really dumb. I don't feel like I'm commanding real soldiers, but instead stiff robotic drones that require me to tell them to duck when under fire or move away when a grenade is right at their feet. Apparently none of these soldiers have instincts or basic training. They often will run straight into enemy fire for no reason and get killed when trying to throw a grenade rather than crawl, and take forever to fire a rocket launcher at a tank, usually just standing there frozen.\n6. Some of the specialty units suck. When I saw you could get paratroppers I assumed you could drop them in behind enemy lines, but instead the just spawn exactly where everything else does.

Germany, GB, USA, Japan & Sovjet Russia. While the pattern for the missions is the same they do play entirely different due too the different maps & nations.\nDefend - attack - defend is what the first mission, more like tutorial mission, is like. Every other mission is either attack or defend. You have to capture outposts, reach waymarks and defend hills & important places. Easy, yet challenging.\n\nThere is no base building involded - you gain new units via reinforcement points or by capturing enemy tanks. Yes, capturing enemy tanks. Each and every one of your units can be split up, managed individually, forged into a new squad, has his own inventory, can be used with manual aim [...].\nIncluding tanks! Tanks can be used with minimum manpower - the driver only. Or you can fully stack up and even place infantry on the back of the tank for faster movements. Its entirely up to you.\nYou units can switch weapons, ammo & special items, you can loot dead enemies to gain new weapons and ammo [...] the possibilitys are endless.\n\nWhat is the challenging part of all this?

IMHO anyways...\n\nThe AI seems much smarter and this may be a benefit of multi core support as everyting isnt being computed by just one cpu core ( This is the first game in the series to utilises more than 1 CPU core )\n\nDue to the better performance everything seems much quicker and smoother and more realistic....\n\nNew vehicle models look much cleaner and more detailed with the new 3D models and shaders...\n\nI have noticed the following improvements that some might see as trivial but overall they make for a better game... IMHO\n\n- Vehicle crews board and unboard vehicles more quickly....\n- Grenade throws are quicker ( in manual control mode anyway )\n- Vehicle crews will look for a nearby repair kit if they are told to repair a vehicle and repair kit is not in vehicle...\n- Ammo out icon for soldiers is great.....\n- Vehicle damage icon is great...\n- Vehcile reloading icon on sqaud icon is great..\n-  New squad icons that show individual soldiers health status is also great.\n- Inventory exchange bug crash from all previous games is  fixed...\n- Transferring ammo between vehicles is less likely to result in the two vehicles crashing into each other.\n- Mortar crews move a bit faster when told to move with the mortar.\n- Mortar AI seems better, You can now use a sniper or officer with binoculars to spot targets and the mortar will engage more wi;;ingly.\n- Repairs are quicker.\n- Grouped soldiers / squads move more smoothly and try to keep the original placement in the squad ( rough formation ) when told to move.\n- Dying / death animaytions seem more varied and more realistic..\n- Soldiers loose their helmets less than previous games... ( no more constanty picking up helmets micro managment )\n- Transferring ammo to a whole squad from a dead soldier or ammo crate is more intelligent,  it gives the correct ammo to the correct soldier ( in most cases ) based on the weapon they are carrying. ( and doesn't crash the game like MOW and AS1 did.. )\n- Mine laying seems quicker..\n- Steam workshop support is a great feature because it will make sharing content easy for everyone..\n\nAll of my observations are from playing single player missions only and don't reflect the Multi player / Cooperative modes of the game....","January 25, 2014","true","190.0"," 42 of 73 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","42","73","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gavriloserb/recommended/244450/","gavriloserb","Gavrilo [SRB]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gavriloserb/","94 products in account","I've played MOWAS2 Both ways, with friends, versus, and singleplayer.\n\nTherefor, I can tell you the best of both-sides.\n\n\nSingleplayer gameplay: The missions in the second MOWAS are an intresting idea, rather then the classic "Move up and capture" system, you are given challenges/difficult side-objectives. Such as, defend the three trench points untill reinforcements, or stealth tasks, or even running out of reinforcements!\nIt's a cool idea, but, it gets old. There are times when you just want to play a classic "Assault and Secure" objective mission, and don't feel like the new stuff.\n\n\nMultiplayer Gameplay: I feel the game is centered on multiplayer. It is a blast to mow down your enemies together, and move up in the bloody battlefields together. But, there are SO MANY PROBLEMS WITH MULTIPLAYER. Example, if a player tabs out of the game, everyones framed will drop about 40-50 frames, it's not just me, it's everyone I've played with. And, if you're un-lucky, they won't restore to your normal frame-rate. Plus, if you have a bad ping, it will also reduce frames for everyone else. It's really annoying, and they really need to fix it.\n\n\n\nPreformance: Men of War: Assualt Squad 2 is so horribly optimized. No-matter what GPU You have, or how many gigs of RAM you have, no matter what you do, you cannot escape the horrible FPS Drops. Singleplayer AND Multiplayer. The explosions of ANYTHING, molotovs, vehicles, or even buildings can freeze/crash your game, or make your frames drop severly. I know it's only a beta, and that's why I'm trying to keep my paitence. But, it sometimes get's unplayable. Something they need to fix PRONTO.\n\n\nOverall outcome: I think MOWAS2 has awesome potential, the awesome new graphics, and relieving bug fixes from the first, really make you get excited for new updates. But, the game is not worth the price it has. For a un-optimized, partially buggy, FPS Dropping beta, $30, $20, or even $15 is WAY Too much. I'd say maybe $10 for the BETA. And I will do a review on the offical release of the full game.\n\n\nMinor/annoying bugs: The bugs in MOWAS2 Are small, but really annoying. Example, your tanks won't always shoot at the targets that are most vital, example, I was playing as the Soviet Union, and a Panther was grinding my Infantry, and my T-34, rather focus on the Panther, focused on infantry. Luckily, you can press "E", and take manual control of your units, (Also needs work), you can take out yourself, annoying, but playable. That's really it for the bugs.\n\n\nFinal Verdict: I'll give MOWAS2 a 6/10, Great potential, but needs tons of work.\n\n\n\nSince that was Early Access, it's time for the whole game.\n\n\nMOWAS2 In my opinion is a train-wreck of, BS Tank penetration, re*tarded path finding, awful voice acting, and most of all, LAG LAG LAG AND MORE LAG.\n\n\nGameplay: MOWAS2's Gameplay is alright. Rather then the traditional "Unit" engine, the game runs off of indiviual men in a squad. For example, unlike in other strategy games, you can split off other single men to preform tasks, like, if there is a Tiger coming down the road, you can sneak a guy in the building to the side, and AT 'Nade it, or, if there is a squad, killing yours, sneak an SMG over and wreck the entire squad from one guy behind. This may sound awesome, but it has ALOT of flaws. Example, the faction balance is horrible. Germany and U.K are just stupidly overpowered. While the United Kingdom had ♥♥♥♥ takes in WW2, they beat ♥♥♥♥ing EVERYTHING. It's un-realistic. And downright annoying. They have huge armor, and for some reason, the guns devistate anybody. Tiger, to an M20. They will get 1-hitted.\n\nGameplay: Tanks: The tanks in the game can be really fun, or really annoying. Even though you have the ablility to press "E" And take control of any man/unit in the game, it still feels very unfinished. The aiming, ecspeically in tanks is really really REALLY hard. The gun never fires at the right thing, but over/under it. And meh, just dosent' feel very nice. The tanks for America are SO underpowered. I know that they had horrible armor, But even the pershing seems UP. Like, a f*ucking 2Pndr AT Gun can 1-Hit a Sherman. A 2 POUNDER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Sorry. I get kinda ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at this game cause it has such great potential, but just dosen't go reach it's hight of glory. German tanks are okay. They could be better. But, meh. They're playable. The Soviet Union's tanks are pretty BS OP as-well. A T-34 57 can One-hit anything. A tiger, to a jeep. It's screwed. Japan's tanks are ♥♥♥♥. But, it's how it was.\n\n\nGameplay: Infantry: Infantry isn't really a problem in MOWAS2, They're pretty balanced. Actually, very balanced. Vehicles seem to ruin the fun play of infantry. Having a fierce fire-fight? It'd be a shame if a tank just ran everyone over. I don't really have much to say about this.\n\n\nGameplay:Multiplayer: This is what ruins MOWAS2. Though, there are single-player missions in the game, the missions are crap though, as said in my Pt. 1 in my review, but, the multiplayer in MOWAS2 can be really fun, if you don't have the FRAME DROPS AND THE LAG SPIKES ALL THE TIME! I swear, if you dare, DARE tab out, or anybody tabs out, it's a ♥♥♥♥♥torm of FPS drops, timeouts, and frustration. And, the game seems to drop FPS randomly. Not a massive problem. The game is very well optimised. And it's nice to play even on low.\n\n\n\nI really can't be bothered to make a huge Pt.2, due to the fact that I could go on for days.\n\nFinal Verdict, of Men of War: Assault Squad 2 is a 4/10 Awful Strategy game.","March 23, 2014","false","84.9"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","14","21","0","0"

Anyhow, MOWAS2 doesn't seem to have too many innovative improvements from it's predecessor. However, the integration of steam workshop and the move to direct x10 is a nice improvement.

As for the game itself, it's a men of war game which come from a long line of men of war - faces of war - soldiers games which thankfully wasn't managed by DMS.\n\nThe skirmish battles are uninspired and reptitive with essentially 3 map templates repeated over across multiple maps.  You have your generic attack missions, your generic defense missions, and lastly your generic 'stealth' assault missions.  They all have the same templates which makes playing a seperate map feel like deja vu all over again.  Generic patrol gets ambushed, go repair and steal the tank before the first enemy wave arrives, etc..  Group of tank in the middle is always present in the "stealth" missions which doesn't require stealth at all nor proper extraction of any but one unit.  As there's no real story mode or any sense of progression, you're just left switching from one template to the same exact template with just a scenary change.\n\nThe only real saving grace is there are mods as there's always been, and modders can actually make decent maps.","June 9, 2015","false","37.9"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"

Enemy jeep with a mounted machine gun will withstand more punishment than your medium tank.\n\nThere's no real tactical advantage in spawning certain unit/armor. You can lose them to almost any type of the enemy units. This game is unsensibly hard and most of the time you'll be wondering how you lost a unit and/or cursing.

AS2 on the other hand I didn't like. It's trash. Plain and simple. Campaign is litterally the same as MOWAS with the DLC missions included. You have to pay money to get new campaigns and features that they should've implemeted when the game came out. Multiplayer is the same way. No new maps, and you have to pay to get new ones. Out synce errors that they have said they have fixed MULTIPLE times, but never have. The gameplay is garbage compared to MOWAS. Then theres the workshop. It was going really good, until they made some patch, that required mods to update when every minor patch came out, that didn't even affect the mod. The only reason I have so many hours in this game, is due to mods. The mods, made this game good, plain and simple. Honestly, all this game is a money horder.\n\nSo would I recommend this game?\nNope.","November 27, 2015","false","464.1"," 23 of 39 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","23","39","0","2"

The 2 have some similarities, but there are also some differences.The units and tanks do look the same. They have added a few units but not very many. I know that this game is a sequel, which means that the game should be similar, but this game looks REALLY SIMILAR.\nPros:\n-The game has pretty good gameplay and quite a few levels.\n-The game is very addictive.\n-There are many different types of units and countries to play as.\n-There are probably 50 different tanks, and each one feels very different from the others.\n\nCons:\n-This game is bascially a reskin of the first one. Some of the maps are nearly identical, and many of the units are the same.\n-This game has some of the worst voice acting that I have ever heard. Since when did German field commanders have American accents?\n-This game is too expensive when compared to teh first which is much cheaper and very similar.\n\nSummary:\nAlthough the game is good, it is basically a copy and paste of the first and seems to be a cash grab. I just picked the first one up and a whole bunch of DLC on sale for $5. Just buy the 1st one and save yourself a lot of money.

The most meaningful 'update' I have seen added the ability for units to auto re-supply. Oh, and they added a tank that is pretty terrible. Apart from that I havent noticed any change in the game since launch. Also, the AI in the game is still terrible, sometimes my AT troops will break cover and run up to a tank and get mowed down, instead of firing the launchers they have. I have over 300hrs on AS1 and to be honest this is the same game with a few new SP missions. On the MP side, I have yet to fully experience it as I have NEVER BEEN ABLE TO JOIN A MULTIPLAYER MATCH. Googling for my problem results in millions of results for 'MOW AS2 Out of sync error'. This issue has still not been fixed for 1000s of people since launch. I feel pretty bad that I convinced my friend to buy this so we could play together only to discover none of us can join any MP matches. The editor is very fun and is where I spend most of my time, but it is almost the same as AS1 in most aspects.\n\nHOWEVER, This is still a fun game (if you like spending 3 days to make a decent looking map to have fun battles on against the ai you have to script every move and action for) and this is indicated by my high playtime on both titles. I heard the devs recently added AI to MP mathces (Which should have been a free update not DLC) and from what I hear, it is pretty terrible.\n\nWould still play this over COH2 though.\n\nverdict (without editor): 4/10\n(with editor)      : 6/10\n(forgetting multiplayer ever existed) : 8/10","June 6, 2015","false","268.1"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

Not much of a strategy player, yet I HAVE played some in the past, and the problem for me, with this one, was that I was totally lost right away. The mission objectives are quite clear, the UI isn't too cluttered, yet I still didn't know how to actually control my soldiers.\nI'd try to get some to throw grenades, marked several at once to take out an enemy shooter, etc, and it only worked like a quarter of the time. I'd try all kinds of combinations (left click, mouse click, function keys), yet never was sure whether I am supposed to manage each soldier individually, command a small group, and how exactly to get them to actually do a certain thing.\nI looked for a tutorial, and all I found was a bunch of short youtube videos linked in game, which didn't help much either.\nCall me a total idiot, if you like, and no, I didn't try the first MoW. But I think if the developer is trying to get new players to join in this day and age (call it the idiot age where people do like tutorials to learn the controls instead of watching youtube vids or googling for a guide), they might wanna give newcomers some clue on how to actually control your troops correctly, without them having to try by trial and error how to even make a soldier throw a grenade.

You can imagine for a player who enjoys absolute control this was quite a let down. I also noticed that the company icons look alot like company of heros unit icons. I played the entire first mission through the Americans and to my suprise after capturing 2 flags i still couldn't recruit a morter team nor could I recruit an mg team and when i recruited a ranger team instead of coming in a half track like they usually do they came on foot. Im greatly frusterated because to me in feels like they have gone backwards and taken away more then improved it.

Its laggy, visually harder to play on the maps, and many crashes (it was near on impossible to play a full game, never mind trying to find someone who was still playing it - due to crashes, this was reported by many closed beta users) - this is a complete disaster and many of the MOWAS users have abandoned it already (and gone back to playing the original game) - a bit like the COH scenario ( 1st one better than the latter). It really is a dissapointing effort by the DEVS, I have played MOWAS for years, along with our little clan of about 20 of us, and were all of the same opinion - ( I think this is the same engine going to be used in Call to Arms, same Dev, and assume its being used as a test bed for this game. I have already cancelled my purchase on steam for this game. It promises much, but delivers little. What we needed was a expansion of MOWAS (such as new maps, different units, different nation addedd, and the bugs that stiil exist in the original to be ironed out (devs still cant do that, so there wasnt much hope with this new version).","February 22, 2014","false","506.5"," 32 of 59 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","32","59","0","0"

Towards the end, you have to get to an extraction point. Simple enough, except it's guarded by an anti-aircraft gun that can see you for miles, and you can't get close enough to take it out. There are three tanks in the level, but the game won't let you take them. You also, have a fixed amount of points, and when I got to the end of the level, I was only able to call in Officers (They literally can't do anything), a single medic (slightly less useless at the point I was at), and snipers (Very useful normally). Funnily enough, it's impossible to shoot off the gunner from the front, and there's no spot I could get to that was behind it, or to the side of it. On top of that, tanks continued to spawn, making the situation worse. If I'm buying a game from you, I should actually be able to play it, instead of just losing, almost automaticly. I'm serverly dissapointed, especially since when I bought it, there were numerous games on sale, invluding the ENTIRE rockstar collection. I could've bought half of them for the same price of this game, but I liked the first Assualt Squad, and was so excited for this one, I wanted to get a little cheaper, and make sure I got it.\n\nTo summarize, broken level, automatic failure, frustration, anger.","March 14, 2014","false","162.7"," 19 of 34 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","19","34","0","0"

The detail is great and the options for battlefield tactics are unlimited. I haven't played a RTS that handles combat as well this does. If you're a Star Wars fan, get the Galaxy at War mod. It'll completely blow away the land battles in Empire at War.\n\nLastly, this game runs very well on my laptop. I have a Nvidia GeForce GT 640M (1GB Dedicated GDDR5) and I'm getting 60+ fps with little action and 30+ when the fighting is heavy on medium settings.

First: big game developers who prove once again that by throwing heaps of money at promotion (I’m looking at you CoH 2) their game can outperform superior games.  And second, people who aren’t willing to put in the effort to learn a new game because it’s hard.  There is no question that MOWAS II is a thinking man’s game.  To be good you have to know armor values, penetration chances, gun calibers, and much more.  You have to invest your points in the right units, know how to use cover, and give your troops good lines of sight.  One mortar shell will kill and entire squad if you bunch them up behind a sandbag because, well, that’s reality.  Remember that veteran tiger that you saved up all game for?  You didn’t support it with infantry so it died to one AT grenade in less than 2 minutes.   It’s not CoH 2, or rather a glorified game of rock, paper, scissors, you actually have to think.  I already know people will say ‘yeah that’s all well and good but who has the time to learn all that?’ and it’s a weak argument.  If you’re going to invest a day of your life into a game anyway what is another five or six hours to learn how to play it well? The point it this is a fantastic game.

There is literally no help learning to play the game. There are some hints that give you strategies or tell you about a specific feature or two, and there is a library of YouTube videos which all explain some of the more complex tasks, but there is no tutorial, introduction, sandbox, or anything like that: you're on your own, and it's trial-and-error. That wouldn't be so bad if the game were a simplistic shooter or a more traditional Age-of-Empires-style RTS: you could guess at the controls and probably get them right enough to play. This, however, is an incredibly in-depth game with a lot of micromanagement that gives you no information about how to find or use its features. It's also a strange combination of realism (various systems on armour which can all be disabled, various weaponry with unique stats and ballistics, etc.) and absurdism (a Thompson with a range of 50 meters, 10+ hits to kill a person, etc.). Like so many others, this game completely ignores the most significant part of a game: teaching the player how to play it.

Though it looks exciting and sounds fun, and moves hard and rapidly, it rarely gets me off.\n\nPeople have been saying that THIS entry in the series is supposed to be the multiplayer, coop one. And I (usually) love watching guys tongue each other’s ♥♥♥♥♥ with my friends just like everyone else does. But what if I told you that the American scenes in this collection are basically the same as the German ones, which are basically the same as the Japanese ones, which are basically the same as the British ones, and the Russian ones? All five of the nations. What if I told you that the sniper (or optionally commandos) scene for the U.S. is repeated four times with the other nations? And also the same for the defense scenes? And also the advance-across-the-set scenes? What if I told you that instead of the 40, original group sex scenes advertised on this store page, you get, actually, just 8 that are (arguably) original? And now, forget the what ifs; because it’s true.\n\nThese 15 and 25 scenes are actually just eight. Different actors for each nation? Sure. But the interracial variety isn’t enough.\n\nWhat about the Steam Workshop mods? Well I played two of the top-rated ones, SirHinkel’s AS2 Missions and RobZ’s Base Defense ones. And they do suck ♥♥♥, but not in a good way.\n\nSirHinkel’s missions are his interpretations of famous man-on-man actions, including a very well-realized The Alamo orgy, from the epic gay porn film Saving Private Ryan. And though Italian and Hungarian men join the action during SirHinkel’s Stalingrad orgies, they’re almost all just long slogs. You can certainly set the intensity of the boning (Easy, Medium, etc.), but instead of more exciting moments of drama, you usually get merely longer scenes. And sure some people like long, hard sex scenes before the actors get so tired that, finally, they all just exhaustedly come onto each other’s throbbing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. But let’s be real: the best gay porn follows the quality-over-quantity standard. SirHinkel DID put a lot of strategic thought into his scenes, with many good placements for many dangerous toys, but as for the great climactic moments, when you just want to ejaculate while the actors do: well, they rarely happen, and (strangely) they usually do so near the beginning of his scenes. So it’s just hours of repetitive hard ♥♥♥♥ing, until it’s finally, suddenly over.\n\nAs for RobZ’s base defense scenes, you look at their descriptions and think you’re in for a really good time. You start playing one and lay your initial men in comfy spots, waiting for the other nation’s uniformed-men to creep up and come on them. But it’s all ruined by what must be two bugs. Specifically: when you call in more of your dudes to join the orgy, they (infuriatingly) WALK, and unenthusiastically. And on top of or under that: these men will change their destination to wherever you tell the next boys you call in. So you have to manually look at the troops as they walk onto the scene and jerk them into running to where you actually want them. And on large set pieces, where the defenses are far from where you call in the new boys, it Just Makes Masturbation a Chore, as you move the screen across the map, clicking the walking unit, moving across the map to where you really want them, double right-clicking that spot so they run to THAT SPOT, repeat...\n\nNo gay porn should soften one's ♥♥♥♥ this much...\n\nAnd what about the player-on-player multiplayer? Is it fun to jerk-off with someone across the Internet, or with your friend next to you? Not compared to the Company of Heroes multiplayer it isn't. MoW: ♥♥♥ Sqd 2 favors realism too much, and doesn’t understand something important about gay porn (or porn in general): Realistic Sex is not what we want to watch. I mean, for realism just go do the real thing. In pornography you want to see lots of herculean men doing all kinds of crazy ♥♥♥♥ to each other’s holes. It’s called FANTASY sex. This understanding is shown by Relic in their Company of Heroes (Vanilla edition). Men of War: Assault Squads 1 and 2 go too realistic, and thus make for undramatic man-on-man "action," over and over and over.\n\nIn conclusion: for gay, WW2-themed cream pies and facials, play Company of Heroes instead. (I haven’t played Company of Heroes 2; feel free to comment if you have an opinion about its ♥♥♥♥♥-rubbing-♥♥♥♥♥ action)","April 9, 2015","false","57.0"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"

Bug fixes are few and far between for a start. But because I love the game so much I didn't mind.\n\nBut the DLC are just a ripoof. Adding bots to multiplayer and the ability to save and share replys should NOT ever be paid DLC. It is like buying a car and then being charged extra for the windows. They are such basic features there is no excuse. Other companies give basic features like that as a free addon because they know it hsould be included since release. Hell, some devs even add extra content; weapons, maps, whatever (depending on game)!\n\nIn vanilla I would have given it a recommend if you want a more realistic and micro managment intensive WW2 RTS than CoH2.

This installment is just a polished MoW Assault Squad I, rereleased with a few extra bells and whistles. On sale, it's worth $10-$20, and if you're a fan of the series than it's worth a little more. It's RTS, squad-control, and micro-management to the extreme. I love being able to control a whole squad, or tank, all the way down to a single infantry man who can pick up a dropped grenade, ammo clip, or check a fallen soldiers inventory. I recommend it for fans of Dawn of War II, CoH's, and the Total War series.\n\n","November 7, 2014","true","187.9"," 15 of 27 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","15","27","0","0"

Where this game trully shines is in the modding there is a very large amount of skins maps full mods that make the game very replayable. Controls are good as well, takes some time learning the menus , repairing, controlling, etc. There is also an editor where you can make youre own maps and upload them to the steam workshop or keep it for youre self. There is also multiplayer which is fun with friends or randoms which offers a competitive experience on regular or modded maps.\n\npros:\n-Good gameplay\n- fun co op online experience\n-good amount of content in base game\n-modding is amazing and has a great amount of content to offer from the great commuity\n-offers a fun and enjoyable experience\ncons:\n-takes a srong computer to run high settings\n- units get stuck sometimes (mostly in modded maps)\n\nOverall this game is fun and enjoyable and can appeal to many people with its large amout of mods and awesome battles\nHope this review was helpful!","February 29","true","77.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Many people can not start the game, most of the people are suffering frequently crashes.

( AS1 should have been integrated into steam servers after gamespy closed all servers for all games they supported... but hey, screw that, charge the same players for another game if they want online features )\n\nEVEN before i'd say buy this even with it being the EXACT same game as AS1, just ... horribly optimized? somehow my computer can play AS1 no problem. but AS2 dominated my computer....? when they're the same game? no, i don't understand either.\n\nbut then..... they did the WONDERFUL "Game update 3.112.0" and this has destroyed the game for me. not only does it run EVEN worse on my computer, to the point that any co-op is impossible even with having very fast internet.... but NOW???\n\nNOW... you have NO supplies in trucks. no ammo, no anything. oh wait, grenades...? cool? yeah, not really...\n\ni loved preparing for an assault, stocking my soldiers up with ammo then heading out. now? you can just put 5 grenades on each person and ... nothing else. i hope you like grenades, because that's all you'll be getting.\n\nbefore, you could unload shells from trucks and make IED's. now, obviously you can't.\n\nyour troops get a magical resupply of ammo from trucks. even the officer supply drop was ruined. no rifle ammo, no SMG ammo, no MG ammo. your troops can just fire all day and get resupplied from a small paradrop. it makes NO sense and just kills this game for me. the realism is thrown out the window.\n\nsir hinkel, as i'm sure anyone that plays AS1 or AS2 knows of... ( if you don't, he makes missions for the German Soldier's Mod, which is amazing as are his missions ) made scripts that resupply your troops with crates / trucks. you can watch the ammo going from the truck / crate, and going into your soldiers inventory. it only resupplies to a set number. so 100 rifle rounds, 300 SMG, 1000 MG....\n\nyet the developers somehow did worse than..... a random person using Gem Editor? are you SERIOUS? someone working for free / fun made resupply amazing yet people making LOTS OF MONEY FAIL!?!?!\n\ni've held off on this for a few months now. there's no difference..... i bought AS2 ONLY to support this company for making games that have realism. now? NO. ( stupid me, i even bought the Deluxe Edition to support this company )\n\nsure, video games are all fantasy, even simulators........but this just destroyed it. this game is not "early access" or alpha, or beta, or ANYTHING else. it's the complete game, and they ruined it for me...\n\nyes, yes... i know, huge long rant about one thing, but it offended me this much. i even posted to developers......no response. nothing. this is the only reason i waited for the negative review. in hopes they'd see and fix this horrible thing they've done.\n\nbecause of this, i truly can't recommend that you spend ...any money on this, let alone 29.99$ ( as of this moment )\n\njust buy assault squad 1 for a lesser price tag... unless you are REALLY devoted to multi-player and don't want to use third party programs for it.\n\nseriously... AS1 is a master-piece and there are a lot of cool scripts and other things you can use to make awesome missions yourself. it's not hard, just need to spend some time on it. i'd be happy to help anyone learn how to use things in Gem Editor, especially for AS1. ( also AS1 will run better on your computer, no matter how good.... or crappy your computer may be )\n\nhmmm also, if anyone thinks "only 21.6 hours?" or anything... look at my play time for AS1, 358 hours as of today, and it "may" be my favorite game...ever. that's why i know AS2 is a huge slap in the face to anyone who has played the men of war games. ( if not going even further back with faces of war and even further back... )\n\nIF and ONLY IF developers put ammo into trucks and crates again will i give this a positive review, and i'd even suggest you pay 29.99$. it's really not a bad game, seeing as it's close to a direct copy / paste of AS1... just doesn't run as smoothly.\n\nLET ME MAKE IED'S AGAIN!!! >;(","May 19, 2015","false","21.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","63","5","8","3","0"

I love RTS and I love WWII, so its perfect for me. One thing to note is that this game can be incredibly complex. The amount of micro you CAN put into this game can be quite insane. Every single unit has an inventory, ammunition, tanks/vehicles have fuel that runs out. It can all be resupplied from trucks or dead troops or vehicles. This game is tons of fun and extremely realistic. There really isnt much of a singleplayer campaign/story its more of just challenge skirmishes that you can play by yourself or with friends. Do not get me wrong it can be incredibly fun. This game takes time to learn, but it is one of the most rewarding gaming experiances ever. I love it. Here is the difficult thing, it really isnt much of a step up from the first Men of War Assault Squad. Yes they included all the DLC maps that they sold to people in the first one, and there are new units and it handles slightly better than its predecessor but not by much. The game is in need of a new engine badly, the games engine cannot handle how complex the physics are. Other than that if you are aware that it really isnt a sequel but more of an update/expansion? I guess and you know what your getting into then go for it pick it up.

All the same skirmish missions with a few extra added in that are new.  It says that in the description and I knew this but I thought they would at least revamp the old missions and add a greater selection of units that they added.  Instead I must trudge through the old missions to get to the new.  The other thing I do not like at all about either game is that each skirmish mission for each country is EXACTLY the same format.  A little variety here and there and perhaps a bit more uniqueness when it comes to the different countries would be fantastic.  Things that feature the strengths and weaknesses of a country perhaps.  I just cannot recommend this game but if you do not have either and absolutely want to buy it then do not get both 1 and 2.  As 2 is all you would need and should have been the only one released.

The maps are identical, the controls are identical, the UI is (mostly) identical, etc. However, the first AS is very old. If you're like me you put hundreds of hours into it by now and have probably even stopped playing it because you've done everything there was to do. I was at that point with the first one and hadn't opened it up in over three months because I was tired of it, until I saw this go on sale for 60% off.\n\nI figured "Hey, what the hell, I get the full deluxe edition for $15 and I will be able to play Assault Squad again even if it's the same damn game." As long as you know going into it that this is just an updated version of the first one, you will be fine and enjoy it. Do not expect anything new from the single player aspect other than a couple UI changes and (somewhat) better voice acting. The voice acting in the first one was so terrible though it wasn't hard to improve on. The only real changes are the focus on Steam and multiplayer. Steam Workshop means this game will stay fresh for a very long time with new content from users and it has all the bells and whistles of modern Steam games like cards to collect, XP to earn, in-game achievements to show off, etc.\n\nThe other noticeable change is the difficulty level. Remember how ridiculously hard the first AS was on Hard mode? I literally rage quit dozens of times because the difficulty level was ABSURD. This game.. not so much. The Hard mode feels like Normal mode from AS. Heroic here is basically Hard mode there. This is a good thing in my opinion because it now allows hardcore fans like me to earn Heroic achievements because they were unattainable in the first. I wouldn't even try Heroic mode in the original one because I figured the AI had pocket nuclear missiles and a time machine to warp stealth fighters and gauss cannons back to beat my ♥♥♥ with. If you ever completed the single-player campaign from AS on Heroic mode, you should write a book about your endeavor and send me a copy.\n\nTL;DR\n\nUpdated version of the first game. Difficulty turned down a few notches. Get this on sale and don't expect a whole new game.\n\n","December 26, 2014","true","248.8"," 13 of 24 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","13","24","0","0"

Also ranking up in this game is hard because developers implemented a new feature called Dsync probably the only feature that affects games the most other then the new GUI.\n\nWhat I want from the next Installment is a new Men of War game, maybe Men of War 2 that isn't a copy from 2003 with less features and more problems. I hope Best Way developes the next Men of War instead of the current kids tweaking the past 4 Men of War games they would of been a much better game if they used a new engine or upgraded the current one in a noticible way, the only upgrade I see in AS2 is bad AI and Dsyc.

No RTS or RTT can get even close to this game. It is almost simulation with lot of physics in it. It keeps you stunned in so many ways. It is real, serious, competitive and beautiful. It lacks the use of planes in multiplayer, I wish it has some of order of war features in this regard. This game is the best ww2 themed game ever made and worth every penny. It is one of my favorite games.

Being extremely tactical and realistic, it is also quite difficult; even the ammo assigned to each individual soldier is to be kept under control!\nTank battles are far more realistic than they are in other similar games; vehicles can be crewed and uncrewed, damages depend on the kind of shell, on the distance from the target and on the hit part. Covers are nice, and it is possible to control the soldiers' stance (standing up, prone and so on) manually. Enemy vehicles, if abandoned and not completely destroyed, can be recovered and stolen. Anti tank guns are really effective against tanks, but there is always a certain amount of randomness which makes everything unpredictable and suspencing. Every action has to be planned accurately, and unreasoned and silly moves are very likely to cause disastrous outcomes; there is a nice reinforcements mechanism which depends on the controlled checkpoints, and new weapons are available on the field after a new checkpoint has been conquered.\nThe only bad thing is that, during multiplayer battles, reinforcements are automatically split among players, causing messy situations ("who called this sniper?" "Can I have your Panzer, or you desperately need it?"). It is possible to send units to an ally player, but this takes time and can be pretty annoying.","April 16","true","126.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Save your 10$ and get something you like to drink and enjoy the mods available to the game.\n\n10/10 Without Iron fist. The reason why I have rated this twice is because before the devs started main lining acid this was leaps and bounds the best World war 2 RTS I've ever seen. Graphics are awesome the mod community fantastic and the realism ( Strategy and logistics) were the best I've seen. This "was not" a COH clone. Tanks running out of gas as you're fighting off hordes of japs or defending the motherland againts blitzkrieg it was simply breathtaking. The power I felt as I shot an HE round from a tiger tank into a building and watching the defends disappear ughh where is that game that I started playing?\n\nI have purchased and played every product this company has made and it makes me sad that the route it's going is the same one that soo many failed games has followed.

Providing the player with five single-player campaigns and armies, Men of War is literally full of different units all of which are unique and are more or less historically accurate. The game always keeps you in strategic dicision making, and the direct firing control which was first introduced in Soldiers Heroes of World War II (a very old but awesome predecessor of this here fine title) makes tank duels an unmatched experience which you won't find in any other comparable RTS (like CoH 2 for an example).\n\nWhat really makes this game valuable and gives many hours of gameplay is the multiplayer. There are many different maps and a decent amount of players. Due to the in-game physics, armor penetration chances, infantry maneuvers, gamestyles of the players, every match is never the same, so every single battle always becomes a new, unpredictable challange. The game also has many modes, so you can always play the one which fits your style, with strategic point control, casual combat and even cooperative missions all being present for you to enjoy. While competing in online battles, the player has the opprotunity to choose his own style of play. Tanks, infantry and artillery all fulfil their crucial roles in order to achieve victory, and all types of units require an individual commanding approach. Multiplayer is undoubtedly the most apparent upside of AS2.\n\nSince the GEM engine is rather old, the graphics in this multiplayer strategy are a bit below the standards, especially if we start comparing this title to Company of Heroes 2. This, however, is compensated by the scale of the battlefields which are present in this game, with explosions and complete destruction of in-game objects all contributing to an astonishing overall image of war as it is shown in Assault Squad 2. In spite of graphics not being the bestest quality of this RTS, they are nevertheless pleasant to look at. The textures are neat, the models of the vehicles are very detailed, explosions and visual effects are dynamic, thus commiting to credibility. Out of anything more negative, i can only note the models and textures of the infantry, which haven't been updated since 2006 when Faces of War came out.\n\nIn general, Men of War: Assault Squad 2 can be recommended to anyone who wants to play a good quality WW2 RTS with a well developed multiplayer.\n\n\n","February 4, 2015","true","72.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mixmorks/recommended/244450/","mixmorks","Kamicase","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mixmorks/","116 products in account","I know more people that have played Company of Heroes than Men of War, which is a shame because Men of War is to Company to Heroes what Arma is to Battlefield. GameplayFirst off: Men of War is a squad based WW2 Strategy Game. The game does not offer any base building but is centered around capturing command posts, which give you points, that you can then use to request squads of soldiers, tanks, airstrikes and the likes. Infantry Combat Every soldier in Men of War comes with his own inventory and his own weapons, which makes micromanagement a must. Troops need to remain supplied with ammunitions, bandages and grenades throughout the engagements which can either be scavenged from fallen enemies (or friends) or vehicles. Furthermore every weapon has its own advantages: SMGs are for medium and short range engagements, rifles for long ranges, LMGs to supress areas, sniper rifles, flamethrowers, pistols. You can move units individually or group them together in a squad depending on the situation.\nVehicle Combat Like infantry tanks have an inventory too. Unlike infantry, tanks also have different armor levels on all sides. Distance to tank, angle of shot, projectile used, and where the shell hits all make the difference between an AT shell that deflects off the tanks armor or disables one of its critical systems (turret, main gun, left or right tread, hull or motor). Remember that scene in Fury where the crew outmaneuvers a German Tiger? This game lets you do that.\nPersonal Control At any point in time you can push E and personally control a unit from the strategic view using WASD and your mouse. I personally wished it was in third person, but whatever. So if tank-mc-gee isn't doing what you want you can just take him over and position him yourself. Which brings me to my next point:\nThe environment: Men of War features very detailed countrysides, cities, and industrial maps which are all completely destructible. Tanks can drive through walls, explosions will destroy windows, vegetation can burn to the ground. A house can shield the flanks of your tank until a cannon lands a shot through the kitchen window. All vehicles, whether destroyed or not, can serve as cover to your units. Same is true for trenches, trees and sandbags (which will provide cover until they're blown apart).\n\n\nOverall I think Men of War is the best squad based RTS out there. The level of realism is insane, the campaings are fun to play with friends (up to 8 player coop). Men of War 2 is more of a re-make of Men of War 1 but definitely adds some things like shared ammunition among squads and new scenarios. I can only recommend this game.","November 2, 2015","true","6.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Filikov","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198045693925/","240 products in account","This game is both the best ww2 title out there and the worst disaster of a game at the same time.  It holds some great game elements as well as some absolute game design disasters. It is sad to see so much potential getting wasted.\n\nFirst, the good stuff:\nLet me begin by saying this: After playing this game for a bit, other titles like Company of Heroes really started to look like jokes.\nBoth infantry and armor gameplay are awesome.\nThe multiplayer game experience in itself is awesome. No other words for it. It has a very good tempo. The stakes are always high. So much can change in a split second. The balance between infantry and armor is top notch. The arcade element is there and it rewards good play. The best part is, this game is doing all this while keeping a very good amount of realism and detail.\nAll the factions that the game comes with. Like, really. I see so many people complaining about AI not being free. Ok maybe thats wrong but you guys realize that this is pretty much one of the few ww2 titles that comes with five factions right? Thats gotta mean something.\nThe mod support. There are mods featuring even the tiniest of ww2 factions. Wanna play as french in 1940? you got it. Would you prefer to play as Poland? Sure thing! You want the game to be much more spectacular and realistic? Tired ot the games linear and unimaginative skirmishes? Do you want to play with star wars factions? Hell, do you want a mod of a weeb anime about schoolgirls and tanks? You have it all. With all the mods there are out there, the vanilla game feels like a mere demo of the full experience. And make no mistake, the vanilla game still has a lot of content.\nYeah, it sounds awesome right, Now for the bad stuff:\nMultiplayer matchmaking system. It's not just bad, it practically doesn't exist. You don't have any way to just hop in and play, you have to host a game, wait for people to join in (which takes so much as 20 minutes sometimes) and you have no idea if they are in your level or not. It can be a nice competitive match or just an absolute massacre. This is the result of trying to implement restricted units and having downright unimaginative stupid map designs for current ingame matchmaking system. A game like this shoud have had dedicated matchmaking for individual mods.\nToo many settings for multiplayer. This is not supposed to be a problem, but when the matchmaking is broken, some people will never learn about the proper balanced settings of the game.\nThe skirmishes are linear and repetitive. If you want good single player content you have to go to the workshop.\nThe difficulty setting of the skirmishes are downright ridiculous. I mean seriously, changing damage infantry takes? I mean how dimwitted you have to be for not realising doing that changes the game's mechanics completely? Being able to run at a mechinegun fire just kills the games experience and gives the beginners wrong expectations about everything. Not to mention that it defeats the whole purpose of having a single player campaign which is primarily educating the player for full multiplayer experience.\nInfantry animations look cheap. It is the first thing most of the newcomers will notice and it doesn't hold up with the rest of the game.\nBugs and out of sync issues. Which is much better by now but having constant out of snyc problems for more than year after the launch is pretty bad. Along with the broken matchmaking, this is the reason why so few people play it today.\nDLCs are not well thought out. Seriously, mods are better.\nThe developers of this game made a great product but somehow it seems like they don't really understand what makes it so great. And they don't seem to understand some of the most fundamental gamer expectations. All that said, I would still recommend this game. Even with all the dlc's the price is a bloody steal for all the content it provides. BUT keep in mind that its rough around some of the edges that it really shouldn't have been.","April 22","true","354.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The game developers have just basically released Assault Squad but slapped a 2 on the side of it, as well as this they add the original games missions in to make up for the lack of content. Still same game engine, no graphical improvement, if there is I cannot tell. Nothing real exciting as a whole. And to make the game "better" they start releasing "DLCs" such as Iron Fist [Tank Combat] which ads 2-3 missions in which all it does is lock your camera view, and Airborne [Self Explanitory] in which the almost same thing occurs, a small hand full of missions is released, as well as "bots" bearly functional AI which should've been in the base game not labled as DLC and getting people to pay for it just for extra money. The only semi-decent thing this game even has is mod support, some of the mods are better than the base game itself, and are even free.To me this game is unplayable without mods.And do yourself a favour, if you already have Assault Sqaud, don't get this game, but if you don't mind numerous bugs, crashing multiplayer, underwhelming graphics and single player campaigns, DLCs aimed to make you pay MORE money to get features which should've been in the base game and a overall disappointing game for any REAL strategist out there.

On one hand, the game is quite solid and does not fail where its predecessor succeeded, but at the same time I see few improvements. The modding seems comprehensive and the multiplayer system is far more streamlined (In my opinion), yet, I find it hard to reccomend this title. There is simply too little built upon from the original by what I've seen. If this were on sale for a good price (which it typically is) I can reccomend picking it up. However, I bought this game at the current price ($29.99) and quickly refunded it, but I do intend to pick it back up later at a cheaper price.\nAs it stands, I can not suggest buying Men of War: Assault Squad II at full price.

BUT its in BETA so not everything is in the game, But there are a lot of new engine improvements that makes the game look amazing in terms of graphics, i have not experience any lag like the first men of war had, there are a few new game modes like day of victory in which you capture the flag that is located in the middle, extreme assault zones which is just a bigger assault zones.\n\nI hear a lot of people complaning that its the same game, well in terms of units there isnt a lot you can add that was in world war 2, it isnt like call of duty were you can add a few more weapons, this game is based on world war 2, i do wish they could add everything from the German soldiers mod to MOWAS 2 because that had a lot of great units, and its only 21€ its not a 59.99€ release. if you arent sure that you like what you see right now, then dont buy it, wait until its complete, and remember its in beta a lot of things can still change.\n","March 9, 2014","true","44.7"," 11 of 21 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","11","21","0","0"

Most of the animations, units etc look like in the first one and the feel of the game is the same.\n\nThere are some major improvements in the play already though and heres some of them. (Will keep adding info as more content comes availevable)\n1)\nImproved pathfinding. Doesnt sound like much does it? It is actually a really big difference the units infantry and vehicles alike no longer get stuck as easy and the game shows the path they will take so if you can correct the route so no longer running through that open area infront of the machine gun or straight to the minefield.\n2)\nMore maps. Again not something major but for me who has played all maps 50 times seeing new maps (and theyre actually new not just old copies from the original men of war) and what Ive tried so far theyre nice as well. Hoping to see more variety on the bigger 6v6 and 8v8 maps.\n3)\nNo gamespy.

Having become very disillusioned with a well known companies latest RTS game which I had been waiting for...for many years, I went out looking for a replacement just to keep me occupied until they got their act together and put it right.  Looking through my old games I resurrected MOWAS1, played a few games and really enjoyed myself.  Then noticed that MOWAS2 was being released in Beta during March 2014, read the blurb and signed up and duly paid my monies for the Deluxe edition...  Since then I have never looked back, I have loved every bit of the 140 odd hours played (that equates to less than £0.15p per hour), and it hasnt even been officially released yet.  Sure there are glitches (still Early Access when writing this post), but they will be resolved. the single play and Co-op has been envigorating and have made many new friends to wile away the hours with.  I highly recommend this game to anyone from a single play and Co-op play perspective (Not really played enough Multiplay to comment).

Then do so now! Men of War is the successor to Soldiers Heroes of WW2 and Faces of War. In many respects the game remained unchanged for many years and then DMS took the reigns with the Assault Squad frnachise. Assault Squad largely focusses on MP and whilst there are Single Player skirmish, these again are recommended to be played in Co Op. There is no SP campaign like the MoW or Red Tide games.\n\nSo what about Assault Squad 2? Its in beta atm and so there are performance issues and bugs as to be expected. The major ground work on AS2 is the engine improvements, graphic updates, new models for many vehicles and tanks and lots of new MP maps and SP missions/skirmish.\n\nThe gameplay is largely the same as AS. The UI has more detailed information now. The UI does look a little bit cluttered for my liking but I am sure a mod will simplify this and it is still in beta so may change for release.\n\nAS2, no more Gamespy! yea! Easier installation and file sharing of mods. In game voice chat. Better options in MP. Having played the beta the SP Skirmish is similar to AS, but there arent waves of enemy attacks. It feels more structured and you get extra resources dependent on your actions. In all the SP side and Co OP looks promising and is a bit more creative than the skirmishes in AS. MP the new maps look and play well. Performance is impacting MP atm, but patches are being released every few days.\n\nOverall not a huge amount different to AS, although the improvements to the engine have upgraded to Multi Core CPU support and therefore the graphics are really looking top notch. The tank models are outstanding. New MP and SP maps should keep us MoW players happy for some time. The new UI gives more information including unit kills per unit.\n\nA complex game which just keeps getting better and better. If you compare AS2 to MoW MP the difference is huge. I wouldnt go back, however the SP portion of MoW is more captivating.\n\n","January 26, 2014","true","414.9"," 21 of 41 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","21","41","0","3"

It features some fantastic new features, namely the UI, steam support, and graphical enhancements. New missions give the single player more life than the challenging, yet monotonous skirmishes of its predecessor. The new vehicle textures are spectacular, including unique camoflage based on environment. Although the infantry textures are somewhat outdated, they don't detract from the game, same with the foliage and shaders.\n\nOnce again, a relatively steep learning curve is displayed, requiring refined skills that can only be achieved through dedicated online play. You CANNOT just jump in and expect to win like other RTS games. You have to be patient and learn from your mistakes. Furthermore, you must dedicate yourself to learning the wider variety of control features the game displays, including the glorious direct control mode that allows for the most epic tank maneuvers you'll experience within the genre, the intuitive unit equiping system that allows you to loot and recover lost weapons and ammo, and finally the vehicle damage/penetration/component damage system, repairing vehicles based on where they were hit. Each of these features are what seperate the Men of War games from the rest of the genre, and mastering them is the key to success in multiplayer and getting over that curve.\n\nThe only qualm I have so far with the game is the multiplayer connection glitches. 1 in every 2 games I have played so far have poor framerates, disconnects, or straight up crashes. This makes multiplayer somewhat unplayable for me right now, whereas Assault Squad 1 had very few online issues. I'm confident, however, that the developers will have the multiplayer optimized by the full release, and as I understand, very few other players have had these issues.\n\nOverall, I definatly reccommend this game to both veterans of the series and new players who want a massive tactical challenge. So long as you don't give up, this series can become one of the most rewarding and intuitive experiences you'll ever find.\n\nPS: To those who would compare this to Company of Heroes, they are different on fundamental levels. COH is an arcade style fast paced base builder with nowhere near as much thought to detail and realism on the level that MOW displays, but is a very fun game for what it is. Don't compare them, just enjoy them both based on what you find to be most satifying.","April 13, 2014","true","204.6"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","0"

This game also allows you to manually controll one unit if you so wish (usually they are AI controlled the same as any RTS).\n\nWith the many different weapons in your arsenal as well as tanks, halftracks 5tons and duce-n-a-halfs this game brings a fast as well as very realistic feel to World War instead of a cookie cutter cut and paste game where everyone is equal. You may not experiance the many small (or large) issues that the allies and axis had in WW2 with things breaking on tanks (from notmal use) but it is still a great game.","November 7, 2014","true","549.9"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","6","12","0","0"

One of the greatest things about this game is that the scale of battle is between COH series and wargame series; The unit count is bigger than COH which give the better feel of coordinating large armies while, being smaller than Wargame, the units are not too tiny or represented by NATO conventions most of the time. Do not be fooled by other reviewers saying the mission are a mundane tasks of assault and defense, the map design is different for each mission which brings the difference in experience. (urban assault, farmland stomp or heavily fortified HQ, etc)\n\nI feel the main focus of the game is on tank battles which are the most fun and memorable in WWII era games. The tanks details and mechanics are well modelled. There are things like modular damage (track and turret damage, crew injury), selectable ammunitions (HE, AP, etc) which bring the realism in these battles.

But i know many who do and they are .... frustrated and ... unhappy in increasing numbers.\nDo I reccomend this game?  as I said, I am getting  hundreds of hours of gaming fun and cannot really dis the game or the Devs, I have no prob dealing with the coop rules.\nSo, if you like solo mod missions, Workshop is loaded with awesome ones I reccomend buying it.\nIF  you are seeking that 8v8 monster battle lag free etc etc  or  you want to climb the ladder in Match Making, the game so far is still a work in progress with the public not knowing when it will be playable as marketed.\nthe DLC was NOT thought out well. hmm ok so its a "taste of whats to come"  as in its a small sample of bigger work that will NOT be charged extra for once its ready.  it just seems backwards to me.  you want me to pay for a preview (some might say demo at this point) but youll give me the full blown implemintation for free....\nOVERALL, upon further reflection, i did decide to change my review rating.  I have had more than my moneys worth already. im also sure that eventually , the Devs will figure out and fix whats wrong and the MP community will get the game they all want.. or at least most of them since its impossible to make everyone happy.","February 19, 2015","true","437.1"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","2"

The only downside is that they have gotten rid of (or not implemented) the ability to pick up weapons off the ground. The micromanagment aspect of the game goes down to the level of ammo managment as per usual for the franchise. They have used a trie and tested formula with new units and a new campaign.

For example it does matter where and how you shoot the enemy tank.\nAnother thing i like is that your troops can pickup different weapons if the for example run out of ammunition. Yes you can even use the enemys AT gruns and even tanks if you are lucky enough that the crew bail out, then you can sometimes repair it and use it.\nDefensive possitions and the world in general also offer various advantages or disadantages.\n\nIn general I like the game and it is pretty cool.\nI have so far only completed the introduction mission 1 and it took 1 hour 45 minutes. I did not count the amount of missions but I would say 30+ so there are many houres of combat if you like to just play against the computer.. If you like there is also multiplayer but I did not yet try this.\n\nEdit..:  If you want to play against "bots" in your own multiplayer skirmish mode, then bots AI are not included as standard in the game ( dooh )  But when buying "airborn" then the "bots AI" computer player will be unlocked... Just thought I mention this.\n\nI hope the future of the series might evolve into a game with a virtuel 2d map where we can move troops arround on a strategic map, and then fight the entire war in a kind of virtual campaign taking place in zones that look like european contrys.. .. Well the campaign system should work like in "wargame dragon". For examle if you move an infantry unit to "denmark" and the enemy move inf+light tanks then you as the player have to fight that battle with only infantry avaliable... The amount of killed units should after the battle be updated on the campaign map and once example the enemys infantry battalion is destroyed then it should be dead for the rest of the war.... however taking various key points on the campaign map should allow the player to get a fre units of reinforsment during the campaign, and the enemy vise vesa... Well that would be pretty cool to play the game like that i think. Who know maybe we could get airplanes and ships also.","August 29, 2015","true","50.0"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"

Boy, I'm glad somebody can stack a bunch of units that are getting shot at by a tank still fire back 5x more than my infantry that is just going against a squad of infantry that's bunched up while they're spread out. Seems pretty cool. Snap shot shooting is even WORSE, I haven't seen my AI do it yet, but I've seen one snipe one my units over a ♥♥♥♥ing river, through some grass just to kill him in time before he finally (after three years) starts to throguh a frag grenade. I've also seen tanks that normally can't penetrate any part of a tank not give a ♥♥♥♥ and still kill it somehow (this is all frontal, the turrent had enough armor as well to repel it) . My infantry by the way in the SAME GAME(S) THAT IT HAPPENED IN, COULDN'T kill people out in the open. Looks like my well trained German soldiers with Kar 98s, an MG42 and some MP40s are actually ♥♥♥♥ing monkeys. However, when the sandbags somehow ♥♥♥♥ing finished all my infantry got ♥♥♥♥ing demolished when they were in cover.\nThe game is underful, but the AI in PvP is ♥♥♥♥ing KILLING ME, I haven't seen much of a problem with Skirmish AI but as SOON AS I SWITCH TO PVP Hooollllyyy shiiittt. From what I can see I would recommend this game, but, you may notice some of the AI problems like I have.

If you like the Company of Heroes franchise or the Wargame series then this game is for you. The developeres of this game keep creating better and better games. The only downside is that they have gotten rid of (or not implemented) the ability to pick up weapons off the ground. The micromanagment aspect of the game goes down to the level of ammo managment as per usual for the franchise. They have used a trie and tested formula with new units and a new campaign.

I used to enjoy doing so. But then one day I discovered Men of War Assault squad. A game that balances realism and gameplay. Infantry out in the open will die in two seconds under mg fire. Flamethrowers kill whoever they shoot at. Flanking, retreating, feinting. This game is far more tactical and strategic than Company of heroes can ever hope to be. Armored battles are both thrilling and nerve racking. A single shell in the right place can end a one on one armor battle. Medium tanks have the same armor stats as their in real life counterparts. Medium tanks will bounce almost every shell off their strong upper glacis armor, but lower glacis is weak like irl. Its outstanding. I am in love with this series and hope to see its player base grow. I am sad that games with far more limited mechanics than this are seen as outstanding, I used to be such a person my self.\n\nPlease try this game. It is so beautiful. Gameplay over graphics.","April 4, 2014","true","190.3"," 8 of 16 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","8","16","0","0"

For example it does matter where and how you shoot the enemy tank.\nAnother thing i like is that your troops can pickup different weapons if the for example run out of ammunition. Yes you can even use the enemys AT gruns and even tanks if you are lucky enough that the crew bail out, then you can sometimes repair it and use it.\nDefensive possitions and the world in general also offer various advantages or disadantages.\n\nIn general I like the game and it is pretty cool.\nI have so far only completed the introduction mission 1 and it took 1 hour 45 minutes. I did not count the amount of missions but I would say 30+ so there are many houres of combat if you like to just play against the computer.. If you like there is also multiplayer but I did not yet try this.\n\nEdit..:  If you want to play against "bots" in your own multiplayer skirmish mode, then bots AI are not included as standard in the game ( dooh )  But when buying "airborn" then the "bots AI" computer player will be unlocked... Just thought I mention this.\n\nI hope the future of the series might evolve into a game with a virtuel 2d map where we can move troops arround on a strategic map, and then fight the entire war in a kind of virtual campaign taking place in zones that look like european contrys.. .. Well the campaign system should work like in "wargame dragon". For examle if you move an infantry unit to "denmark" and the enemy move inf+light tanks then you as the player have to fight that battle with only infantry avaliable... The amount of killed units should after the battle be updated on the campaign map and once example the enemys infantry battalion is destroyed then it should be dead for the rest of the war.... however taking various key points on the campaign map should allow the player to get a fre units of reinforsment during the campaign, and the enemy vise vesa... Well that would be pretty cool to play the game like that i think. Who know maybe we could get airplanes and ships also.","August 29, 2015","true","50.0"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"

Although this game requires a learning curve, once you learn it, it can be a hell of a lot of fun. The amount of units give you a wide variety of ways to deal with the enemy, this goes for both the campaign and the multiplayer. However this game does have its bugs and glitches and does require pretty good internet and decent PC/Laptop to run, the awesome clutch moments and hilarious moments you can have completely outwiegh all of that. The mods are alos really good, making realism even better although a little bit harder, I suggest you rack up a few hours of the vanilla game before taking mods on because they really change gameplay. If you love the World War 2 time period and love RTS games, this should be your dream to play, however if you play War Thunder, a few things are different so keep that in mind. Little side note before I stop, the game has  a LOT OF EXPLOSIONS, LIKE A SH*T TON. THERE ARE EXPLOSIONS THAT MAKE VEHICLES DO 360 SPINS 100 FEET IN THE AIR, IT IS F*CKING AWESOME!

For example it does matter where and how you shoot the enemy tank.\nAnother thing i like is that your troops can pickup different weapons if the for example run out of ammunition. Yes you can even use the enemys AT gruns and even tanks if you are lucky enough that the crew bail out, then you can sometimes repair it and use it.\nDefensive possitions and the world in general also offer various advantages or disadantages.\n\nIn general I like the game and it is pretty cool.\nI have so far only completed the introduction mission 1 and it took 1 hour 45 minutes. I did not count the amount of missions but I would say 30+ so there are many houres of combat if you like to just play against the computer.. If you like there is also multiplayer but I did not yet try this.\n\nEdit..:  If you want to play against "bots" in your own multiplayer skirmish mode, then bots AI are not included as standard in the game ( dooh )  But when buying "airborn" then the "bots AI" computer player will be unlocked... Just thought I mention this.\n\nI hope the future of the series might evolve into a game with a virtuel 2d map where we can move troops arround on a strategic map, and then fight the entire war in a kind of virtual campaign taking place in zones that look like european contrys.. .. Well the campaign system should work like in "wargame dragon". For examle if you move an infantry unit to "denmark" and the enemy move inf+light tanks then you as the player have to fight that battle with only infantry avaliable... The amount of killed units should after the battle be updated on the campaign map and once example the enemys infantry battalion is destroyed then it should be dead for the rest of the war.... however taking various key points on the campaign map should allow the player to get a fre units of reinforsment during the campaign, and the enemy vise vesa... Well that would be pretty cool to play the game like that i think. Who know maybe we could get airplanes and ships also.","August 29, 2015","true","50.0"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"

It's so amazing how much it has improved in terms of AI and graphics in the game. (Even though the AI is still flawed). Sucks that I didn't watch it grow with the previous games over the years... :(\n\nI really like the workshop support for this game as gamers like us can put in and share our own missions, mods in the game (and there a really some talented ones at that). The 'direct control' function in the game sure is unique and really helpful in some situations, although I hear some people complaining about the 3rd person missions DLC. Hey, what's wrong with devs trying new things? The game isn't that strong storywise and all the factions have practically the same missions but on different maps, so singleplayer is pretty bland overall. However, being able to play them cooperatively with a buddy pretty much makes up for it. Haven't really tried multiplayer yet and I'll give it a go someday. Till then, co-op for days!\n\nWill recommend this game for WWII lovers as well as RTS lovers. It's really unique in my opinion.

Although this game requires a learning curve, once you learn it, it can be a hell of a lot of fun. The amount of units give you a wide variety of ways to deal with the enemy, this goes for both the campaign and the multiplayer. However this game does have its bugs and glitches and does require pretty good internet and decent PC/Laptop to run, the awesome clutch moments and hilarious moments you can have completely outwiegh all of that. The mods are alos really good, making realism even better although a little bit harder, I suggest you rack up a few hours of the vanilla game before taking mods on because they really change gameplay. If you love the World War 2 time period and love RTS games, this should be your dream to play, however if you play War Thunder, a few things are different so keep that in mind. Little side note before I stop, the game has  a LOT OF EXPLOSIONS, LIKE A SH*T TON. THERE ARE EXPLOSIONS THAT MAKE VEHICLES DO 360 SPINS 100 FEET IN THE AIR, IT IS F*CKING AWESOME!

I am a master league sc2 player and my pc has a radeon 6850, just for clarification. I have also tested this on a friends pc  and everything is the same.\n\nI have noticed that if you issue commands very quickly they do not register and its as if you never issued them. e.g. If you select 5 groups of men and move them all by rapidly pressing the correct # keys then clicking with your mouse, often only the first group or two will have received the command despite you pressing each group key then clicking. This also happens when trying to rapidly click and drag over units and grouping them, jumping between several vehicles to change ammo, telling multiple artillery to fire on ground, telling a squad to throw several gernades, ect.\nThis will happen in offline skirmish with graphics as low as they go.\n\nThis just seems to be how the game is programmed, its like the game can only process APMs so fast and if you go beyond that it doesn't work. I suppose this could be a hardware problem on my and my friends end, perhaps our Cpus are too weak or something like that. But i dont know, in sc2/planetary annihilation i can issue commands as fast as my body will let me, i can rapidly hit group keys and issue move orders and everyone of those commands works and they all start moving. In Sc2 i can click and drag and make up 5 groups in about 2 seconds, in MOWAS2 this is just impossible.\n\nI asked my friend if he noticed this and he said he didn't, i went over to his home and reproduced it, clearly noobs cannot see this problem; you have to be able to micro. I am an armchair historian and i enjoy this game because of that and also i suspect eveyone has this APM cap to deal with so its not like anyone has an unfair edge But still if you are a high ranked RTS player and you know how to micro, sometimes this game will make you want to stick a fork in your eye.","July 9, 2014","true","454.4"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

I haven't played anything from the MoW series up until now, and having played a few hours it reminds me of one of my favourite games of all time, Soldiers: Heroes of World War 2. So I'm pretty amazed how this series has escaped me for all these years.\n\nI love the diverse tactical approach to different situations, and I also love the inventory system.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KU47x0/recommended/244450/","KU47x0","The Soviet Penguin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KU47x0/","177 products in account","TL;DR\nIf you're into WW2 RTS games, Men of War: Assault Squad 2 is probably worth full price. Plenty of content, a fairly active multiplayer scene, an abundance of mods, and rock-solid mechanics. There are some issues - mainly engine and online stability issues - but they don't necessarily ruin the game. DLC isn't spectacular, but Airborne is worth the buy. MOW:AS2 is definitely worth the price, especially if it is on sale.\n\nGraphics & Sound\nFunctional. Not much to write home about but the game looks pretty and it doesn't eat your framerate. Sounds aren't terribly impressive but they work well enough. Voice acting is iffy, with a lot of it being recycled from previous MOW games.\n\nCore Gameplay\nIncredibly fun. MOW:AS2 adds a lot of nice additions to Men of War's already awesome gameplay. Although it can be micro-heavy, infantry combat is enjoyable and the inventory system gives the players much more freedom than similar WW2 RTS games. Vehicle combat is also a lot of fun, thanks to the ability to directly control your vehicles. AS2 also adds plenty of helpful UI elements and mechanics that just build on the classic MOW gameplay.\n\nSingle-Player\nNot brilliant, but not bad. There isn't a campaign to speak of - just a large number of individual skirmish missions. They all tend to be very similar as well, which can be problematic if you get bored by samey missions. Despite the similarities, the skirmishes themselves can be pretty enjoyable, especially the defensive skirmish missions. However, stealth missions are flat-out terrible, in my opinion, because of the game's AI. Skip them.\n\nMulti-Player\nPretty good. Balance-wise, the game isn't brilliant. At least, it doesn't beat Company of Heroes in terms of balance. Still, Germany vs. USA games and Soviet vs. Germany games are well balanced, and thus quite popular online. However, the matches themselves are a lot less predictable, since there is high capacity for shenanigans thanks to the gameplay mechanics. This can be good or bad, depending on your play style. Still, the competitive multiplayer is enjoyable.\n\nAlso worth noting is the ability to play the single-player skirmish missions cooperatively. If you have a friend or two that like WW2 RTS, playing the coop skirmish missions on a higher difficulty can make for a really good time. You can also play modded skirmish missions cooperatively, so there is actually a wide array of coop content.\n\nAs of me writing this review, the game's online has a number of stability issues, primarily the "Out of Sync" issue, which can disconnect a player and ruin the flow of the game. The devs have said that they are working on it, but it should be mentioned, especially since it is a fairly common problem.\n\nModding\nMen of War games have had good modding scenes for quite some time. AS2 is no exception. In fact, I would say it has one of the best modding scenes out of the entire franchise. There's a lot of total conversion mods that can completely change the game, adding a lot of replayability. There are also tons of custom skirmish missions and multiplayer maps. The modding scene is active and adds a lot to the game.\n\nDLC\nThe DLC for this game is not particularly great. For starters, the Deluxe Edition is a complete ripoff. The XP boost is pointless, since a lot of servers play with unlocked units, and unless you REALLY want that fancy nametag, the Deluxe Edition is not worth the $7. ($5 when bought with the game.) Iron fist isn't great either. It adds some War Thunder-style tank missions that give you direct control of a veteran tank. Problem is, you can directly control your tanks in the vanilla game, minus the fancy camera angles and the mission flavor. Not worth $10 - get it on sale if you want it.\n\nThe best DLC out of all of them has to be Airborne, which adds five very enjoyable skirmish missions. The missions are focused on infantry combat and defense. They also give the option of skipping the stealth section, and the maps are quite unique. It is debatable whether or not the multiplayer bots should have been added into the game for free, but the DLC is already out. To be honest, the bot AI is actually a bit disappointing, especially when it comes to vehicles. Still, the bots might make Airborne worth full price. Depends on your standards.\n\nOverall, Men of War: Assault Squad 2 is a good game. It is an essential for anyone who enjoys WW2 RTS games and I can honestly recommend it. The price is reasonable, especially when you consider the active modding scene and the solid multiplayer.","August 16, 2015","true","83.4"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","4","9","0","0"

AI is stupid as hell, soldiers lie down near grenade to be blown into pieces, tanks are being driven by lobotomized monkeys who after being order to attack enemy's tanks can't take appropriate position for firing and either stand still or take ridiculos routes to be vaporised by some AT gun they decided to pass by. Being under sniper fire any troops just doing nothing, being popped one by one, not trying to hide or drop down, nothing. If you overlooked a sniper kiss your troops he is after a goodbuy, they will just obidiently die one by one. Not a freaking mesasage "you're under sniper fire". In order to make your soldiers fight properly you have to slow down time and take control manually in the zones where ♥♥♥♥ is happening. The more forces you have the more annoying it becomes, while you babysitting your tank on the left flank, you stupid morons of soldiers are getting slaughtered on the right flank. If you want to win and minimize casualties you have to micromanage EVERYTHING. I got the game for the weakend, and NO WAY IN HELL I'm buying this piece of crap afterwards. The game is only playable when you have couple of platoons and 2-3 tanks, more than that - and the game becomes a freaking mess and a micromanagement fair. F this ♥♥♥♥, I'm back to Company of Heroes, that game doesn't have the inventory, different types of ammo, fuel for tanks, the vehicles looks a bit more cartoonish - yes, but at least CoH is PLAYABLE. I can play it for hour or more without suicidal thoughts. Oh my god, I'm so furious at the MoW now... The singleplayer in this game is awful, this mechanics are not suited for big maps and big armies, since there is too much happening around and the AI is stupid as hell. Also too much random - tanks miss in most cases, and if the shot does connect you never know what will happen, enemy's PZ4 can survive dozen shots from T34, and in the next skirmish T34 oneshots your PZ4 with it's first shot. Or other way around, it only matter of luck, the higher caliber the more chances you get, but it's anyway too random. Ok, I let some steam out. Resume - if you are into singleplayer - this game has a very annoyning one, full of micromanagement and direct control of units, while playing on the slowest time setting available. I regret investing time in it... MoW was a nice series until this assault squad crap corrupted it.","March 28, 2015","false","8.1"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Atrocious amounts of glitches and bugs. Be prepared to fight the unresponsive soldiers, inability to resupply some units, your commands not being obeyed, and soldiers being stuck on their way to designated position, i.e. unable to go around obstacles, and stepping in place. AI seems infinetely stupid, and a bit overpowered, i.e. constant suppply of them is a bit overdone. Micromanagement is ridiculous, i.e. you need to re-supply all squads under fire,  but supply units are first to be fired upon. Snipers are useless, as they can't see any further than other units, and can't shoot very quickly, so they will do a kill every now and then, and that's all. Waves of incoming units are ridiculous, as there's no time to re-supply properly, or actually fight the resupply system, as soldiers just don't want to re-supply in most cases. There's no control over how and when vehicles like tanks fire from their main gun and when from the MG.\nDon't get me wrong, it's really nice game, but ridden with bugs.

The added on AI is amazing and fun! they play strictly with assault zones so far and even with the Modded Map packs that i have downloaded! There are some stuff the AI does pretty stupidly from time to time like charging in artillary peices as tanks, or using tanks as infantry to cap assault points. But what AI doesnt have problems? can always be patched up! although any difficultly besides heroic can be pretty easy. heroic is just right for me i feel since theres a lot of stuff to deal with and counter! perfect for practicing with! I havent tried the airborne missions though but knowing their singleplayer tendencies its most likely great! Id say if your tired of facing complaining humans in the MP or being kicked all the time for stupid reasons BUY THIS DLC!! its worth every penny! and its fun facing the AI when it doesnt mess up! always fun to comp stomp or if your at work to kill a little time!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/enoch190/recommended/244450/","enoch190","Elathien","http://steamcommunity.com/id/enoch190/","221 products in account","This game is definitely underrated and highly enjoyable to even the most non rts type players once you work out the kinks.\nThough not without issues, this game is a master piece.\n\nGameplay- 10/10\nWithout a doubt, this game caters to a more precise crowd of people. The level of control over your units alone is enough to salivate the most hardcore of fans in the RTS genre.\nThe actual battles themselves? Pure unadulturated goodness. Your troops actually matter. Their positions actually matter. The different types of units actually matter. In other games things like AA guns and some MG placements just get killed early and barely make any difference in the fight. COH2 being one such example. However in this game, each and every unit can have a massive affect on the battle. Very unique playstyles can be done in this game.\n\nContent - 10/10\nThe fact that it has 5 fully fleshed out factions is amazing in itself. Other such games in this genre could learn from this. The amount of units within these factions is awesome as well. Yeah some of them are copy and paste but it definitely is enjoyable to be to have diversity.\n\nGraphics -6/10\nSomewhat lacking given the year this came out in. Though I understand it's difficult to do RTS games with amazing graphics and still have everything running correctly. Still, aesthetically pleasing for the most part.\n\nStory - 5/10\nNot played too much of the story. But pretty similar to other such games in this genre. Typical WW2 scenarios and plot driven kill the enemy type scenarios.\n\nCinematics - 2/10\nOne of the only things I find annoying about this game is the little cut scenes in some of the missions, especially during a skirmish when playing with a friend and you lose track of your units when it comes on.\n\nMusic - 3/10\nThe music gets extremely repetitive.\n\nControls - 9/10\nThe controls takes a lot of getting used to if you want to be good. However, they are there for a purpose and once you figure it all out you are a master of the battlefield.\n\nMultiplayer - 9/10\nOne of my only cons about this game is that during the Multiplayer if someone has a terrible connection or a not so good graphics card, everyone tends to suffer from lag. I've yet to play a game where the MP was extremely stable and there wasn't some weird frame skipping when you moved players.  Other than that, it's addicting. You willl never feel so satisfied as you do when you win multiplayer matches. It is absolutely addicting. It's been a long time since a game has made me feel like this.\n\n\nOverall, this game is absolutely worth the price, especially on sale!\n\n","December 27, 2015","true","27.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/enoch190/recommended/244450/","enoch190","Elathien","http://steamcommunity.com/id/enoch190/","221 products in account","This game is definitely underrated and highly enjoyable to even the most non rts type players once you work out the kinks.\nThough not without issues, this game is a master piece.\n\nGameplay- 10/10\nWithout a doubt, this game caters to a more precise crowd of people. The level of control over your units alone is enough to salivate the most hardcore of fans in the RTS genre.\nThe actual battles themselves? Pure unadulturated goodness. Your troops actually matter. Their positions actually matter. The different types of units actually matter. In other games things like AA guns and some MG placements just get killed early and barely make any difference in the fight. COH2 being one such example. However in this game, each and every unit can have a massive affect on the battle. Very unique playstyles can be done in this game.\n\nContent - 10/10\nThe fact that it has 5 fully fleshed out factions is amazing in itself. Other such games in this genre could learn from this. The amount of units within these factions is awesome as well. Yeah some of them are copy and paste but it definitely is enjoyable to be to have diversity.\n\nGraphics -6/10\nSomewhat lacking given the year this came out in. Though I understand it's difficult to do RTS games with amazing graphics and still have everything running correctly. Still, aesthetically pleasing for the most part.\n\nStory - 5/10\nNot played too much of the story. But pretty similar to other such games in this genre. Typical WW2 scenarios and plot driven kill the enemy type scenarios.\n\nCinematics - 2/10\nOne of the only things I find annoying about this game is the little cut scenes in some of the missions, especially during a skirmish when playing with a friend and you lose track of your units when it comes on.\n\nMusic - 3/10\nThe music gets extremely repetitive.\n\nControls - 9/10\nThe controls takes a lot of getting used to if you want to be good. However, they are there for a purpose and once you figure it all out you are a master of the battlefield.\n\nMultiplayer - 9/10\nOne of my only cons about this game is that during the Multiplayer if someone has a terrible connection or a not so good graphics card, everyone tends to suffer from lag. I've yet to play a game where the MP was extremely stable and there wasn't some weird frame skipping when you moved players.  Other than that, it's addicting. You willl never feel so satisfied as you do when you win multiplayer matches. It is absolutely addicting. It's been a long time since a game has made me feel like this.\n\n\nOverall, this game is absolutely worth the price, especially on sale!\n\n","December 27, 2015","true","27.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

They took some really important features out of this game, but they added good mod support, to correct these problems.  I like this game, but it is really similar to as1 with not enough differences, which I dont like, I really only recommend this game if you havent played as1, or are new to the series.\n\nAnd with the maps, there are VERY good new maps which I absolutely adore, but in some of them, I realized there is no versatility, no game-changing things, and it gets almost robotic, for example, im USA facing Japan, the enemy player sends a kamikazi, sneaks through all of my lines, and then takes out my sherman jumbo.  Im spooked, and then reinforce my lines and everything, but within that few seconds of attempting to strengthen my lines, the enemy player attacks with elite infantry and light tanks, which I cant counter because of my jumbo gone, and I lose the game because of one kamikazi.  I just dont see that anymore in as2, atleast, not often enough, and that a major flaw in this game for me, making me at times really frustrated.","January 2, 2015","true","419.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Have to say the detail is much greater than I had expected.  (picking up and using dropped weapons, vehicle damage is down to the panel hit, soldiers helments flying off when shot).  I do think some of the historical accuraces in terms of when certain weapons and tanks become available leave a lot to be desired in the scenarios.\n\nWhilst this is squad oriented you can move individual soldiers, this can be a help and a hinderance.. it does become a bit to much like micro management.. i.e having to heal troops when a medic is right next to them, or having to individually supply troops with new ammo when they are all standing around the supply truck... this does leave it a little frenetic in the heat of battle.\n\nI started the game on normal difficulty which seems REALLY difficult.. so switched to easy which seems far to easy so struggling with getting the right tempo.. artillery strikes are rediculously accurate in the scenarios.. to the point a nebellwerfer was more pinpoint accurate than an 88.....and loaded and fired more quickly it seemed.\n\nApart from those little gripes the scale of the maps, certain micro management (in house out specific window) and the overall game play gave it a slightly more 'real war' feel vs COH (certainly COHII) COH is still one of the best , WWII squad games available but this is up there.\n","December 23, 2014","true","50.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

There are many complaints about how MOWAS2 is the same game as MOWAS, and this is largely true, but not a reason to rate the game down.\n\n2) If you've played Company of Heroes, then MOWAS is similar but much more realistic - more like a WW2 simulation.  This makes it a harder game harder to learn, and harder to master but ultimately makes it feel more like you are playing WW2, rather than playing a video game (as with CoH)\n\n3) Unfortunately DMS (the devs) are a little sketchy.  For us, the gamers, this means a) the multiplayer is sometimes unreliable and dropped games, lag and connection faliures are too frequent.  It also means you get shady things like MOWAS2 being bacisly the same as MOWAS (see above), and DLC's that are rather obviously designed just to make money and have minimal content.\n\nOverall: an outstanding game that is an absolute MUST for any WW2 RTS lover.\n","February 26, 2015","true","945.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Not only can you steal enemy vehicles and guns, you can steal those vehicles' supplies and use them yourself, and then ASSUME DIRECT CONTROL with E and turn the game into a third-person shooter. You can control the inventory of individual infantry down to their damn hats and the bullets in their gun. The environments are almost entirely destructable to a striking degree of detail, which leads to awesome moments like when the bomber you call in for an airstrike is shot down by enemy forces (Yes, you can do that too) and it crashes into a house and knocks it to pieces.\nThe only two complaints that I have about this game are that you can't commandeer everything on the field (Battleships, a German artillery piece in one or two missions, some boats, etc), and that it's far too similar to the original MOWAS - most of the missions are just ported from the older game, and there are very few engine differences - it makes buying the older game feel like a waste of money. I suppose this could stem from the fact that they're all taken from real battles that faction actually won, but I think the base game could stand to have a little more replay value. Still, though, given how much fun it is to play the missions that are there, it doesn't hurt the game much.","May 4, 2015","true","49.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","2"

In my opinion Men of War 2 is at the moment one of the best WW2 RTS games. The micro unit management gives tons of possibilities to customize your army. The fact that you can arm your soldier with whatever weapon gives that gameplay flexibility, you are no longer attached to a fixed model you can create your own army.\n\nBut there's also more cool stuff! The workshop in this game is huge, there's a lot of missions that you can play solo or co-op, which is great because you will always have something new to play. However the games has a big problem that, AI.\n\nThe enemy AI in all difficulties seems to be OK, but your AI seems to be totally stupid. The number of times my soldiers got killed for throwing AT grenades at half a meter from a tank is way too high. There will be situations where you order your soldier to throw a grenade and run through enemy fire to throw a grenade or even worse. The tanks can go full ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and turn around and give the whole back side to the enemy and get instantly killed. It is definetly frustrating the AI issue but for the rest it's a great game, the most important thing is the modding community that helps updating the game with the missions and mods-","May 11, 2015","true","94.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","2"

Example: In the mission Overlord for the americans, when calling in paratroopers a squad of 5 parachutes in, instead of just one trooper, this is a major fix in my mind, logically you would send 1 trooper in at a time and sending in squads would be a more "rational" amount.\n\n3: MAJOR FIX: mulitplayer is fixed and you can play online, unlike the other Men of War: Assault Squad that ran off of game spy (an unused and discontinued gaming network). This makes the game so much better, multiplayer, for players who has friends that don't own the game, or those who don't have friends (if you don't have any, make some!)\n\n4: This isn't a fix but makes the game so much more fun, Steam Workshop, custom maps easier to get and mods the same!

On a whim I fired up MOW AS2 today and had an absolute blast with it. This is a must play for WWII and RTS enthusiasts. It's challenging. Absolute tons of micromanaging to be done here but when you start getting it and making combined arms tactics work it is thrilling. Honestly, it's a difficult game to master and I'm not there yet but if you want a challenge this is your game. The graphics on ultra settings are very very nice and the game's presentation is more "realistic" if I can use that word than Company of Heroes. Performance is a little uneven which is understandable with everything that's going on. It's crazy how many moving parts there are here so a respectable processor is recommended. I have what currently is the flagship AMD APU the A10 7850k OC'ed to 4.5ghz paired with an R9 285 and 32gb of ram (design) and when there's a lot of concentrated artillery, infantry and vehicle movement it can run in the low 20's though I wouldn't say it makes the game unplayable. I probably should mess around with the shadows and post processing to see if I can improve that but for the most part the game runs well. Obviously your experience will vary and if you're on a laptop or older desktop then be prepared to make serious sacrifices in the graphics settings. I should probably mention that there's no proper campaign, it's more a series of disconnected battles vs. the CPU but I didn't feel the game suffered because of a lack of narrative. If you like WWII you get the context and you can fill in the blanks yourself without having a character driven story line. Well, that's it. If you're reading this at all it's because you're interested so pull the trigger. It's a great game 9/10.","August 6, 2015","true","65.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","1"

Not only can you steal enemy vehicles and guns, you can steal those vehicles' supplies and use them yourself, and then ASSUME DIRECT CONTROL with E and turn the game into a third-person shooter. You can control the inventory of individual infantry down to their damn hats and the bullets in their gun. The environments are almost entirely destructable to a striking degree of detail, which leads to awesome moments like when the bomber you call in for an airstrike is shot down by enemy forces (Yes, you can do that too) and it crashes into a house and knocks it to pieces.\nThe only two complaints that I have about this game are that you can't commandeer everything on the field (Battleships, a German artillery piece in one or two missions, some boats, etc), and that it's far too similar to the original MOWAS - most of the missions are just ported from the older game, and there are very few engine differences - it makes buying the older game feel like a waste of money. I suppose this could stem from the fact that they're all taken from real battles that faction actually won, but I think the base game could stand to have a little more replay value. Still, though, given how much fun it is to play the missions that are there, it doesn't hurt the game much.","May 4, 2015","true","49.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","2"

In my opinion Men of War 2 is at the moment one of the best WW2 RTS games. The micro unit management gives tons of possibilities to customize your army. The fact that you can arm your soldier with whatever weapon gives that gameplay flexibility, you are no longer attached to a fixed model you can create your own army.\n\nBut there's also more cool stuff! The workshop in this game is huge, there's a lot of missions that you can play solo or co-op, which is great because you will always have something new to play. However the games has a big problem that, AI.\n\nThe enemy AI in all difficulties seems to be OK, but your AI seems to be totally stupid. The number of times my soldiers got killed for throwing AT grenades at half a meter from a tank is way too high. There will be situations where you order your soldier to throw a grenade and run through enemy fire to throw a grenade or even worse.

There are many complaints about how MOWAS2 is the same game as MOWAS, and this is largely true, but not a reason to rate the game down.\n\n2) If you've played Company of Heroes, then MOWAS is similar but much more realistic - more like a WW2 simulation.  This makes it a harder game harder to learn, and harder to master but ultimately makes it feel more like you are playing WW2, rather than playing a video game (as with CoH)\n\n3) Unfortunately DMS (the devs) are a little sketchy.  For us, the gamers, this means a) the multiplayer is sometimes unreliable and dropped games, lag and connection faliures are too frequent.  It also means you get shady things like MOWAS2 being bacisly the same as MOWAS (see above), and DLC's that are rather obviously designed just to make money and have minimal content.\n\nOverall: an outstanding game that is an absolute MUST for any WW2 RTS lover.\n","February 26, 2015","true","945.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Not only can you steal enemy vehicles and guns, you can steal those vehicles' supplies and use them yourself, and then ASSUME DIRECT CONTROL with E and turn the game into a third-person shooter. You can control the inventory of individual infantry down to their damn hats and the bullets in their gun. The environments are almost entirely destructable to a striking degree of detail, which leads to awesome moments like when the bomber you call in for an airstrike is shot down by enemy forces (Yes, you can do that too) and it crashes into a house and knocks it to pieces.\nThe only two complaints that I have about this game are that you can't commandeer everything on the field (Battleships, a German artillery piece in one or two missions, some boats, etc), and that it's far too similar to the original MOWAS - most of the missions are just ported from the older game, and there are very few engine differences - it makes buying the older game feel like a waste of money. I suppose this could stem from the fact that they're all taken from real battles that faction actually won, but I think the base game could stand to have a little more replay value. Still, though, given how much fun it is to play the missions that are there, it doesn't hurt the game much.","May 4, 2015","true","49.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","2"

In my opinion Men of War 2 is at the moment one of the best WW2 RTS games. The micro unit management gives tons of possibilities to customize your army. The fact that you can arm your soldier with whatever weapon gives that gameplay flexibility, you are no longer attached to a fixed model you can create your own army.\n\nBut there's also more cool stuff! The workshop in this game is huge, there's a lot of missions that you can play solo or co-op, which is great because you will always have something new to play. However the games has a big problem that, AI.\n\nThe enemy AI in all difficulties seems to be OK, but your AI seems to be totally stupid. The number of times my soldiers got killed for throwing AT grenades at half a meter from a tank is way too high. There will be situations where you order your soldier to throw a grenade and run through enemy fire to throw a grenade or even worse. The tanks can go full ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and turn around and give the whole back side to the enemy and get instantly killed. It is definetly frustrating the AI issue but for the rest it's a great game, the most important thing is the modding community that helps updating the game with the missions and mods-","May 11, 2015","true","94.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","2"
