I thought it was a reference to difficult games, that are great, but can be frustrating at times, such as Super Meat Boy.  This was probably the dev's intention, however, this was not why I raged!\n\nSimply put this a 2d platformer, and it seems there are a plethora of these going around at the moment.  The genre is going through something of a revival, and there are loads of really cheap, and excellent games of this type thanks to indie developers.\n\nSo why is this game so utterly bad?\n\nFirst off, there does not seem to be any controller support.  In a game of this type, that is always going to be a major issue for me.  So then I went into the options menu to try and learn the keys.  Nope, there was no way to learn the basic controls, let alone change them!  At this point I could see many red flags, before the eventual red mist.\nNext, the game starts.  Graphics were poor, really basic, and uninspired.  It made some genuine 8-bit games of old look pretty!  Music was repetitive and very grating.  Yet another factor to add to the overall miserable experience of this disastrous title.\n\nThen the ultimate kick in the balls.  The gameplay...or sheer lack of it!  Platformers of all ilk, live and die (no pun intended) due to their gameplay.  A 'hard-as-nails' game, as this pupports to be, can be excused if it has fine gameplay, and the player knows that they died due to their mistake.  It's what creates a kind of zen moment in platform games, when you zip along, with only your reflexes and guile to keep you going.  Well, with atrocious level-design. clunky movement, and glitchy enemies, there is no gameplay whatsoever.\n\nListen I know this game is cheap.  That does not mean you should buy it.  In fact I think the dev should pay us all for the mental anguish that this steaming pile inflicts on the gamer!\n\nWorst game I have played for as long as I can remember.  Avoid at all costs.

Selfish games are the absolute worst. They demand so much of your time and energy that you'll have difficulty going back to playing good games. Let's say you sit down and force yourself to finish this game. Even though the first level heaps mounds of crap at you, you just keep going. You gain a tolerance for the ridiculous design-decisions and poor controls. A sensible person would have given up on this game after a couple of minutes, but you soldier on. You've got the eye of the tiger, there's no easy way out, and you're the best around.\n\nSo what happens when you beat the game? Don't ask me because I haven't the slightest idea. Usually I finish games before I review them, even the terrible ones. But this review isn't about me, or the game, it's about you. You've beaten Super Distro, and now you're going to play another videogame. Let's pick a random game like uh... Super Meat Boy? Alright. I've heard good things about that one.\n\nThe thing is, you've been playing Super Distro for so long, that you've lost your bearings. You'll try to play Super Meat Boy, but you can't adjust. You'll be saying things like "The controls are too responsive!" and "These levels are hard but also fair. I can't handle it!" or even "Why am I playing a game that doesn't make me wish for the sweet embrace of death?!?!?" This is why I hate selfish games. They take everything away from you and give nothing in return.\n\nLook. I'm only writing from experience. I spent a year playing Friday the 13th on the NES, because it was the only game I owned for the system. It took another year in order for me to re-adjust to playing games like Contra, Super Mario Bros, River City Ransom, and so on. Super Distro isn't the only game you own right?

The enemies and locations lack originality and don't make any sense at all.\n\n'Super Distro' is a challenging game but that does not make it a good game. The reason why it's so difficult is mainly because of the horrible controls, enemies are often on spots where you can't even shoot them without getting hit.\n\nIf that doesn't get you frustrated there's still the terrible music playing on the background which plays in a loop of 6 seconds or something.\n\nThe best thing about this game is probably the price (currently 9 cents!) so you can still sell the steam trading cards.","November 3, 2015","false","0.1"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","2"

Its graphics look like something off of Newgrounds, rather than something that shares the Steam Store with the aforementioned Super Meat Boy and AVGN Adventures, but countless other games.\nI want to clarify the dev might be a nice guy and all, but they CLEARLY werent ready to post something on the Steam Store at all.","November 3, 2015","false","0.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

And I'm saying when, because the developer has shown that he's very much in touch with the community for this game and has taken the criticism (and I hope some of the good criticism too) to heart and has promised to fix a lot of things in the next update. The one thing I'd really like to see is a controls screen/section/menu, because while spending the first few tries figuring out the controls is quite challenging and difficult, it is not the kind of difficulty I was looking for. I understand there are a lot of games out there where you don't get the controls thrown at you, but they're not my cup of tea and for a game like this, where I think the enjoyment mostly comes from getting thrown right into it, I'd like to know if I'm only ablo to jump, can I throw fireballs, etc. Especially if you're not going to make people play through a tutorial, which can be quite boring, give them the controls to read through and maybe make them editable?\n\nI've heard some people had issues with the performance of the levels, I didn't have any real problems with that. The only thing I noticed was that it took a few seconds for some enemies to load (which was probably done to keep the performance as high as possible).\n\nThe last point I've got is a more personal one perhaps. I am and stay a lot more interested in games (even these more difficult ones) when I can complete at least one level, which acts a bit like an incentive to keep playing. Checkpoints do that too and I understand that those take away the difficulty a bit, but there's nothing worse than finally getting through a very difficult part, immediately dying due to something trivial and having to start all over again. That's great in later levels, because I know those are supposed to be more difficult, but on the first level it kinda turns me off the game. Though I guess this does keep true to the 'Taking "Difficult gameplay" to a whole new level'.\n\nAll in all, I give this game a solid 4,5 out of 10, because I believe it is a great idea, if not a bit poorly executed and I'm fairly certain that with a bit of work Super Distro can become what is was supposed to be.","October 24, 2015","false","0.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The biggest thing that angers me is that 30% of the reviews are positive, either out of pity toward the one-man developer, or because they are gluttons for punishment.\n\nThis game is not comparable to dark souls, megaman, or ghouls & ghosts. There is barely pattern memorization here. The real issue comes with control memorization. You shoot with E, you jump with space, you move with the arrows. This game has controls straight out of Windows 95, and at times looks and feels that way.\n\nThe animations are horrendous, the music is so repetitive and bland that you WILL keep the volume down, and the wonky controls will make you quit this game ASAP.\n\nTo those who said this was "difficult", no, it's not difficult. It's bad. There's a difference between a difficult game, and a poor game. To those who scream "Hey man, it was cheap/free!", there are hundreds of free-to-play games on Steam right now. I would play every single one of them before I touched this game at it's base again.\n\nTo the developer: You noted development on a hotfix in August. Here we are in November with nothing. I think your best bet is to scrap this garbage product and regroup with some better developers. Join a studio, or possibly take some classes to help better yourself for the next game you create. I'm not sure why your options menu was so lacking, and I'm even more confused how you had such little dignity to put your name on such a piece of garbage like this.

However, this game is so hard in all of the wrong reasons, I am going to review it anyway. Difficult games are not fun by themselves. They need to rely on other factors such as good music, graphics, and unique gameplay mechanics to keep the gamer hooked on their game. Super Distro *ahem* sorry, SUPER DISTRO does not have any of these factors.\nThe first level music is one of the worst songs I’ve ever heard. The graphics are bland. The gameplay is just jumping and shooting enemies hoping you don’t get hit by their bullets. The main character is faceless with one mundane death animation. The game flat out refuses to teach you the controls. And no, this isn’t some kind of learning curve. Some gamers are going to use a keyboard to play their game and they have dozens of keys to try before figuring out the E key is the correct key to fire bullets.\nOverall, this game tries way too hard to prove that it is difficult rather than proving than it is a good game. For something that advertises itself as “rage inducing” the only emotion I feel is pity for the developer. They don’t care that their game is good, they care that their game is hard.\n","November 7, 2015","false","4.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/anema86/recommended/364690/","anema86","Anema86","http://steamcommunity.com/id/anema86/","71 products in account","Boring, uninspired, and just not much fun. It's difficult, yeah, but it fails to give you any reason to push through that difficulty. It doesn't have the unbridled charm of Super Meat Boy or the anger-inducing tricks of I Wanna Be the Guy. Super Distro has no charisma. If you want platform hell, go play I Wanna Be the Guy. It's free and vastly superior. Or Super Meat Boy, if you haven't already.\n\n3/10\n\nIt's not that it's a BAD game--it's just a soulless game. The music is irritating as ♥♥♥♥, too.\n\nIt's also not unique to Super Distro by any means, but I REALLY HATE having to Quit the game, then "Press Start to begin" and then Quit the game AGAIN to actually close out of it. When I choose to Quit the game, I expect the game to close, not for me to have to Begin the game again, and choose quit again.\n\nSuper Distro isn't bad because it's difficult. I love difficult games. I've become the Guy. I've done everything except about 2/3 of Cotton Alley in Super Meat Boy. I unlocked the Kid in Super Meat Boy, son. I ended up keeping only one part of the video, and pretty much refuse to ever do it again, but I did it. I play the hell out of classic Mega Man. The challenge is not the reason the game sucks. The game sucks because it's soulless, has grating music, and isn't fun. You know that point where you're playing a really challenging game, like IWBTG or Super Meat Boy, and you keep doing the same screen over and over and dying, but you're loving it and enjoying every second of it?\n\nYeah. That won't happen here, especially not if you've sunk your teeth deeply into other superior titles, like IWBTG and Super Meat Boy.\n\nEven IWBTG had checkpoints. This argument that they reduce difficulty is stupid. They don't. The reduce tedium. Having long ♥♥♥ stages with no checkpoints isn't any more difficult than the same thing with checkpoints. Checkpoints won't make platforming any easier. They won't make surviving enemies easier. All they do is decrease how much ♥♥♥♥ players have to redo when they for. Redoing ♥♥♥♥ isn't a matter of difficulty. It's a matter of tedium. Think about someone whose job it is to work in an assembly line and repeatedly screw in fifteen bolts. That's tedious, but not difficult. Think about someone whose job is to crunch large financial numbers all day. That's tedious and difficult. Think about an astrophysicist. That's difficult, but not tedious. Tedium and difficulty are NOT the same thing; tedium is simply used by bad designed as a substitute for difficulty.\n\nThis isn't a joke. This isn't hyperbole. I'm being dead ♥♥♥♥ing serious. I paid nine cents for this game and I genuinely feel like I got ripped off. The only excusable price for this game is free. Anything over that is a rip-off. I gave this guy money. And he returned the favor by ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in my ears and brain for 12 minutes.\n\n\nI'd add that the developer seems like a nice guy. That doesn't really matter here. The game sucks, and any chance of him being a genuinely good person went down the drain the moment he sold this ♥♥♥♥ and compared it to Mega Man. He may be a really great guy, but that doesn't change the fact that selling something of such abysmal quality (for example: evidently, trying to mute the sound lowers graphical quality) completely undermines that; you can't be a nice person while selling ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to people. Want to be a nice person? Don't sell people ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Fixing the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t you sold isn't being a nice person; it's trying to make amends for being an ♥♥♥.","November 11, 2015","false","0.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

So for that, I really want to like the game. And I AM going to finish this game, no matter what.\n\nWith that said, the game has dissapointed me so far purely because the graphics are just a mix of different art-styles and images ranging from pure (S)NES goodness in the fonts to strange smoothed pixel art and things that appear to be just images with a cheap pixelated filter applied to them. It appears that the designer is not sure which art style to follow, of the developer does not have designer-person-individual on their team.\n\nI also have mixed feelings about the controls, it does not feel nearly as crisp as the megaman games. But I can't quite put my finger on what the problem is. It might be the response.\n\nAt this state, I'm afraid I can't recommend it. Just because it doesn't feel or look like a profesional game. Anyway, I'm going to play some more and finish the game. If I'm not back in 6 months, call the police.\n\nFeedback\nGraphics\n\nPick an art-style and stick with it, the game Jet Gunner does this perfectly I think. Perhaps the art-style of Mega Man X6 would be the closest match for the current theme that's going on in this game. Just make sure it's consistent with the rest of the game and preferably with the era of games it's trying to emulate.\n\nDifficulty\n\nIt's difficult, but it's not fun. Most of the time it does not feel like you are in control, you're just jumping and hoping for the best. Whereas back in the day, or even in the more modern VVVVVV it's all about timing and maybe just a little bit of luck.\n\nPersonally I like checkpoints that are just one bit too far to reach. But when I finally get there I always get a sense of victory, and I didn't even finish the level.\n\nEnemies should be placed on strategic points, not on annoying points. The player should be able to stop and think "God, how am I going to get through this.", not immediatly think, "Alright, here goes nothing.". Which happens to be exactly what I thought when I was somewhat halfway (I presume) through the first level.\n\n-UPDATE- I just saw the developers note on his/her intention to improve the game. The developers is aware of most, if not all of what I said. And all of it has already been mentioned on other reviews and the steam page. With that being said, I'm going to change me initially negative review to a positive one on the assumption that this game will be better.","October 6, 2015","false","3.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Russian","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ScotGRussian/","912 products in account","Where do I begin...?\n\nThe art assests are... ok, at least for someone with little experience.  The enemies popping into existence when you are 12 feet away, and from thin air, is a little jarring.  The enemies almost look like cut outs that were slapped onto a cardboard backdrop.\n\nThe music...  no.  First level is VERY unnerving.  The music drones in a GameBoy-era style, but without the charm and proper harmonizing.  Instead you have notes just clashing every few seconds after each death.\n\nDeath mechanics are a little wonky, but not totally terrible.  I get hit by a sawblade going up an incline and get knocked down.  I still have health, but I fall down the "pitfall" that I may be able to jump from.   Instead the game's aperture closes and I start anew.\n\nThe controls are atrocious.  You have enemies shooting in 8-directions (from a static point) yet you can only shoot in one direction.  It may be a slight nitpick, but it's kinda lame.  The controls of moving around are very sloppy.  There's little-to-no momentum and you just slosh around.  Whenever I am hit (again from the example above) the saw-blade enemies, I have no chance to react.  I'm knocked around and have no chance to do anything.\nThe wall-jumping is neat to include, and with the shooting reminds me of Megaman, but instead of tight jumping controls like Megaman X, you instead have a floaty mess of a walljump that decays faster than you can compensate for, due to how far off the wall you jump.\n\nThe menus have little control on a wired-controller, which is how I play platformers.  I often have to press "Left" in order to go to the right of an option.  Whether I am changing between Video or Audio, or I'm trying to change which arrow I want to select and change the resolution.\nWhen I tried to fullscreen the game, my screen cut to black for around, 30 seconds with no response.  I thought something had crashed when Ctrl+Alt+Delete yielded nothing.\n\nOverall, terrible experience, and I am SO glad I paid nothing for this game.  Really hoping to have a "free" refund just to take it off my games list.","September 26, 2015","false","4.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I really tried to play more but I just couldn't, it's that bad.\n\nFirst thing getting into the game the menu was super laggy no matter what resolution I put it to. Getting to the actual game the first thing you notice is how bad the graphics are, and how boring and uninspired the art is. It looks so blurry I thought it was a resolution issue at first but no, that's just how the game looks.\n\nThe enemies have awkward shooting patterns and placements. It's impossible to jump from platform to platform without getting hit by the enemies projectiles. There are these spinning fire obstacles in between some of the platforms, these are impossible to dodge, you just have to jump through them and take the damage.\n\nI couldn't get past the first level, it was too painful to play and I couldn't be bothered with my time. You may think it's stupid to write a review when I only played 22 minutes worth. It doesn't take that much time to realize just how much effort was put into this game.\n\nIt's broken, and I'm glad i got this for free.

'What's going on here?', I thought. Nevertheless, I started a new game and was greeted with a rather mundane story, where a kid is sick of today's games as they are too easy, and plans to make a hard one that'll make gamers 'rage.' I try to skip the cutscene, and up pops a little 'PRESS A TO SKIP' alert. It's an Xbox controller's A. Uh oh. I plug in my Xbox controller and await the inevitably bad port that follows.\n\nI don't actually know if the game I'm playing is the game that the kid planned to make, as it just dumps me into it right after that last line, without warning. They say the first casualty of War is truth. The first casualty of SUPER DISTRO is a meaningful story. Right off the bat, I'm hit with awful, irritating 8-bit music on loop. 'Right, time to mute that.' I turn the music off completely in options, go back to the game, and the music persists. The only difference is that the game's quality has hit 240p levels.\n\nMy ears are bleeding at this point and my eyes begin to water. Surely it gets better, right?\n\nNo.\n\nThe gameplay is boring and repetitive, controls are clunky even on a controller (god help you if you go for keyboard controls with WASD movement and E to shoot. Yeah.) and the enemies are uninspiring. You've got wall mounted little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who shoot, flying ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s that shoot, sawblade ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s stuck on the ground, midair spinning ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, etc.\n\nTo summarise, I don't really recommend this to anyone, whether they're there for the platformer, 'high' difficulty, or for any other reason. There's just not enough to make this game stand out from the rest. It's not the worst game by a long shot, but its nothing special and really nothing new, and it lacks polish to say the least.\n\nGive it a shot if you get it free (Trading Cards!!!), but otherwise its really not worth the money.","January 27","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Really? I haven't played it yet. After deleting a non-existing data we can start a new game.\nHere an awfully drawn little story appear.\n\nNow we can play.\nFirst thing, which couldn't stay unnoticed, is a horrible graphic. It's more like a school project of some student that can't draw rather than a game people have to pay for.\nSo I want to play.. And have no idea about the controls. After hitting every button on keyboard I found which one is for shooting and one for life cheating. I have no idea if it was intentionally left, but okay, it can be a bit useful.\n\nActually, even the cheat button doesn't help much. I understand this game had to be hard on purpose. Hitting an enemy results in death the most time. Not because you got hit enough times, but because you fly in a random direction and usually end up in some gap. Then you have to start the level from the beginning. And once more. And so on.\n\nI lost my interest in this game. Let's say it clearly, I dropped cards and I want to forget about the experience with this thing.\n\nIf it was in pre-Internet times and I had nothing better to do I might be more stubborn with this game. But today, when the world offers us thousands of games it's not worth our time. If I wanted to play something like this one, I would open the Internet and found something on Newgrounds or Congregate for free. And the games would be surely better done than this one.\n\nHonestly, this game shouldn't be on Steam. At least not among games that people have to pay for.","October 2, 2015","false","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But the one thing that all GOOD hard games have in common is precise, responsive controls.\n\nIf a game does not have pinpoint control then it becomes hard for all the wrong reasons and that is the problem with this game.  The control in this game is among the worst I have ever seen, your character moves like he is walking through molasses and the jump button is incredibly unresponsive.  The first section of the game has some pretty basic platforming, by all standards jumping from platform to platform here should be easy, the platforms are nice and big so there is no real way to over or under shoot your jumps, but due to the horrific controls this section is borderline impossible.\n\nI have no idea if this game has potential or not, what I do know is in its current state it is completely unplayable, avoid this game no matter how cheap it gets(I think I spent 50 cents on it and I feel robbed).","January 16","false","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

'What's going on here?', I thought. Nevertheless, I started a new game and was greeted with a rather mundane story, where a kid is sick of today's games as they are too easy, and plans to make a hard one that'll make gamers 'rage.' I try to skip the cutscene, and up pops a little 'PRESS A TO SKIP' alert. It's an Xbox controller's A. Uh oh. I plug in my Xbox controller and await the inevitably bad port that follows.\n\nI don't actually know if the game I'm playing is the game that the kid planned to make, as it just dumps me into it right after that last line, without warning. They say the first casualty of War is truth. The first casualty of SUPER DISTRO is a meaningful story. Right off the bat, I'm hit with awful, irritating 8-bit music on loop. 'Right, time to mute that.' I turn the music off completely in options, go back to the game, and the music persists. The only difference is that the game's quality has hit 240p levels.\n\nMy ears are bleeding at this point and my eyes begin to water. Surely it gets better, right?\n\nNo.\n\nThe gameplay is boring and repetitive, controls are clunky even on a controller (god help you if you go for keyboard controls with WASD movement and E to shoot. Yeah.) and the enemies are uninspiring. You've got wall mounted little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who shoot, flying ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s that shoot, sawblade ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s stuck on the ground, midair spinning ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, etc.\n\nTo summarise, I don't really recommend this to anyone, whether they're there for the platformer, 'high' difficulty, or for any other reason. There's just not enough to make this game stand out from the rest. It's not the worst game by a long shot, but its nothing special and really nothing new, and it lacks polish to say the least.\n\nGive it a shot if you get it free (Trading Cards!!!), but otherwise its really not worth the money.","January 27","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are parts where you have to get hit to get past (such as almost the whole first level, or i'd assume, as I won't ever be able to get that far). Bullet consumption is pretty stupid, as it's hard enough to get by without constantly having to wait (and then get launched by massive knockback saws).

They are floaty and they need to be responsive. Messing with the physics will help.\n\nThe game was free and it has steam cards.

Let me correct some reviews though. CONTROLLER SUPPORT WORKS FINE. Yes, controls are a bit difficult. No, it's not as fluid as other platformers. But, you CAN figure out a stream through the levels just like any other. NO, I've not beat the first level. IT'S HARD. It's meant to be hard. It will probably eat my soul. However, I'm really going to enjoy raging. controls on 360 pad are simple. A jumps, X shoots. You jump off walls to get to hard places. You time your jumps and shots. It's REALLY hard. But it's not BAD. It's really addictive for a cheap game, actually. I'll give 6\10 for the pleasure of raging more than I did at Megaman 1.","May 20","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Has many bugs, at times you die in so many absurd ways that is just hilarious.\n\nPros:    The developer is quite active.\nHas steam cards.\nHas potential, it could be entertaining if it weren't so frustrating\nCons:    Hard, not for its level's design but for its harsh gameplay.\nControls sucks badly, the movement is clumsy, very stressful.\nNo checkpoints, I know this is supose to be a hard game, but common at least add a training mode or something like that...\nThe game is basically a trial and error exercise. For example, I had to die like 20 times to finally get used to the control scheme. Seriously needs a tutorial or training mode.\nUgly graphics, c'mon even for an indie game...\nBoring music...\nIn short, Super Distro a game for masochists the bored...\n\nMi puntuación: 3/10 Lo intenta, pero realmente le falta mucho...\nUn juego complicado, sobre todo por lo terrible del control... Tiene muchas fallas, en momentos llegas a morir tanto que terminas odiándolo, aun así tiene su encanto, sobre todo que evoca la nostalgia de los juegos de antaño en los que te morías a cada paso.\n\nPros:    El desarrollador se muestra bastante activo, se espera una actualización que mejorará el juego.\nDa cartas.\nTiene potencial, podría ser un poco entretenido, si no fuera tan frustrante.\nContras:    Es duro, no por que los niveles sean muy complejos, si no por la jugabilidad limitada...\nEl control es malo, el personaje se mueve bastante descontrolado.\nNo tiene checkpoints, te mueres al final del nivel y toca empezar...\nEnsayo y error, creo morí como 20 veces ante el primer enemigo antes de darme cuenta que es lo que se tenía que hacer, hace falta un tutorial o al menos popups para los nuevos...\nGráficos feos, aun para ser un juego indie son malos...\nLa música es aburrida....\nEn definitiva, Super Distro un juego para masoquistas...","November 20, 2015","false","10.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
