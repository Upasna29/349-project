For an indie game there are plenty of graphics settings incase you can't already run it at 60fps. Audio sliders are good to go. Menu is intended for console and so it works better with controller. Tutorials are in text form and are easy to read through.\n\nControls:\nThere is full controller and keyboard support with keyboard being rebindable. Controller is recommended to play and feels better. Keyboard feels a bit out of place especially on default.\n\nIngame:\nFlying through campaign and multiplayer with campaign actually posing a challenge. The game looks great, you'll never see a bad texture with the speed you're going at and so my frames never dropped below 60. There are 3 game modes in campaign and 5 in multiplayer these are speed race, power race and survival with multiplayer adding deathmatch and team deathmatch to the line. All planes have different attributes for speed, acceleration, armour and more.\nWhile going through the campaign you will also unlock extra skins for your planes. When the competition is far ahead it's difficult to catch up and going outside of the intended path will push you back. Tricks will earn you boost power and in power race you can turn in a power like rockets, machine gun and shields for extra boost.\n\nMultiplayer:\nYou can play online against others and invite your friends which is ofcourse the best way.\nSadly to say nobody is playing the multiplayer so you need friends who own the game.\nI was lucky enough to have these and can say that multiplayer is strong and fun.\n\nAchievements:\nSteam has a few achievements to unlock mostly done through campaign. The game also has in-game achievements in the form of medals.\n\nDLC:\nThere are 2 pieces of DLC available. First the airplane pack which adds 3 awesome planes to the selection. Second is a multiplayer pack that adds a few arena maps and weather conditions.\n\nConclusion:\nSkydrift is an action packed game and very enjoyable. For multiplayer you'll need friends who own the game. Great fun will be had! DLC is also up for debate and I would say maybe on a sale.","November 19, 2014","true","14.0"," 29 of 31 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","29","31","0","2"

There's an element of adrenaline, chaos, split-second decisions, not even good racing games are as cool as this. The game looks and sounds good, the planes have a degree of customisation (paint) and you have enough planes to choose from. The combat system is good as well, making it easier for new players to adapt rather than making it difficult to shoot stuff. Arcade is the largest factor of this game, simulation not so much, and good for it.\n\nYou do need some time to adapt, won't be pro on the first tries, but there's no way you're not gonna enjoy this even a little bit. It might not be addictive, grant it, but that's not a bad thing; this is the sort of game you keep in your library and now and then come back to, because it's gonna be fun anytime.\n\nPS: Joystick or at least controller, keyboard won't be as good.","July 7, 2014","true","2.3"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","18","21","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Blast-Attak/recommended/91100/","Blast-Attak","Jeremia","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Blast-Attak/","689 products in account","Skydrift is a fun and fast arcade style combat-racer with planes. It does a lot of things good but also has some problems too.\n\nThe good:\nGameplay is fast even down to the load times. You can finish a race in 3-4 minutes, so it's a perfect pick up and play game.\nThe weapons are basic, but fun to use. Machine guns, homing missiles, mines and Area-Stun shock.\nOpponents are challenging, but not unfairly so. I'm not sure if the AI has rubber-banding or not - but they do keep up.\nThe tracks are cool with open spaces and small tunnels. Driving through small tricky spaces are awarded with boost.\nA few different game modes like the basic death race, elimination and speed race.\nDifferent planes to unlock and choose from with different stats, not a crazy amount of variation as they basically handle pretty much the same anyway. Every plane has 4 different skins to unlock and choose from.\nThe campaign is lengthy enough, nothing spectacular: No story or real progression, just pick your plane and finish the next race and earn more plane unlocks and skins.\nHas controller support for Xbox-compatible controllers and Joysticks.\nThe bad:\nVery few tracks. Fortunately, they are good and look different from one another. They do reverse the tracks in some races to give it a bit of a spin. Also in some races the scenery starts exploding and falling apart and adding hazards to the race.\nThis one is a common problem with flying racing-games. As flying gives you so much freedom in all directions it's a bit difficult to lay out a track. This game handles it fairly well in most places: the tracks are designed to funnel you in a certain direction and arrows guide you in the right direction and creates borders. But sometimes there are obstacles that fall just in the line of that funnel and an invisble wall forcibly guides you in the right direction resulting in annoying crashes.\nThere IS multiplayer. But it's a ghost town. No-one playing. This can't really be faulted on the game itself. But just a heads up for those looking to play online.\nHas Xbox controller support - but the screen icons do not change from the keyboard layout. You can view the controls from the options however.","June 15, 2015","true","5.3"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","0"

It reminds me of Diddy Kong Racing from back in the day, (which was like Mario Kart but with planes). The game is a lot of fun, especially in multiplayer. If you‚Äôre looking for some simple-pleasure arcade action, you probably want to check this out.\n\nAt the core it is a racing game, so your objective is always to come in first. As you buzz around, you collect power-ups (like protective shields for your plane or missiles to launch at your enemies) which will help you win the race.  It‚Äôs simple and arcade like, and as such don't expect it to feel anything like you‚Äôre flying a plane for real.  But it is easy to get the hang of, and is a nice casual experience. That said, I highly recommend using a controller, because it is much more natural than a keyboard & mouse.\n\nIt is also noticeable that the graphics are pretty nice. They aren‚Äôt anything amazing, but for a game that is clearly focused on gameplay as a selling point, I thought the graphics were an excellent bonus. I mean: if you‚Äôre going to blow your opponents out of the sky while doing a barrel-roll through a hollow stone circle, it doesn‚Äôt hurt if it looks pretty cool too.\n\nIt‚Äôs pretty easy to beat the "campaign," leading to the game feeling somewhat short. You unlock new maps and new planes as you play through, but there is very little noticeable variance to be honest; regardless, the game is short enough that it doesn't really matter much.  By the time you start to become bored, you will have beaten it.\n\nThe multiplayer is a whole different ballgame. The game is much more exciting to play against other people. When I played I was able to find some games, but it wasn't very populated. If you can find some people who want to meet up, that is probably your best bet. I did it a few times on the weekends and a few random people jumped in too and we wound up with full games. That was fun, but I wouldn‚Äôt count on that being the standard.\n\nAnyway, Skydrift is definitely a fun game. If you think you would like what it offers, it is worth your consideration. Doubly so if you have a couple of friends to play with.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","November 18, 2013","true","21.3"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","15","20","0","0"

Especially if you are crazy enough to try Normal/Hard difficulties. AI will leave you in the dust as you keep crashing. Speed racing especially can be a big 'nope' moment for many.\n\nBut as you learn the levels - which there are not that many - then the differences between planes and tactics in levels. not to mention aerial acrobatic/low flying comes into play.\n\nMultiplayer games are a blast. You only need 2 players of equal skill and you got yourself very tight races. Every single time.  You will need to learn to master those counter measures and offensive weapons.\n\nGame is strong on singleplayer too. Just do the campaign on Easy or normal and then add some difficulty. Good luck trying to 100% all achievements.\n\n\nps. get the Premium Airplane pack. it is so cheap and adds useful planes to the game.","April 15","true","17.4"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

I mean, I got to stage 5 and there's only 7 stages. And of those 7 stages, it's the same 3 or 4 levels that are being raced on, they're just set up differently as you progress. They're either speed races, power races, or reverse races. So the game does get kind of boring as you progress. There isn't much reward for winning besides in-game medals and Steam achievements, if you're into that.\n\nI will say that the graphics are gorgeous though. The planes are well designed. The levels have great texturing. But there is an over abundance of particles which I think is the cause of some serious stuttering, which is the main reason why I'm done with this game. The serious stuttering almost makes it unbearable as the frame rate drops far below the already locked 30 fps and the plane becomes uncontrollable, causing you to crash and lose your position. Although it's fairly easy to get your space back.\n\nAnother thing, this game is best suited to play with a controller. I tried playing with a kb/m, and a 360 controller was just so much more natural.\n\nI wouldn't recommend the game though. There are many other racing games that have way more levels to try out. There's only so much you can do with the same 4 levels.\n\n6.0/10","August 3, 2014","false","1.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

With it's fast unreal action, loud engines, crazy power-ups (rockets and EMPs), this game gives me the same thrill as Hydro Thunder, even though that's superboats and not super-planes, and Hydro Thunder seems to be the best game to compare this to. The levels are full of vibrant detail and as the race progresses, the environments change too! There's a volcano race that is absolutely insane when it starts erupting, and a canyon level that starts to crumble around you! Also, the graphics of Skydrift are pretty as well! The planes are well-detailed and very colorful and they each have their own style of flying. I play this game with a gamepad (ps3 controller) so it's a little easier to control than if you were playing on a keyboard. I tried it with a keyboard and my hands couldn't take the coordination it required. I highly recommend this game to anyone that loves crazy arcade racing games!","October 18, 2014","true","2.3"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

I don't even recall exactly how it got into my Steam Library -- part of a Humble Bundle, I think.  So my expectations were not set particularly high when I finally tried it out.\n\nAnd I was impressed.\n\nThe controls are really tight, the action is frantic, and the graphics are pretty.  It's not a flight sim (and not trying to be,) it's more like MarioKart with the addition of vertical steering.  What SkyDrift does, it does very successfully, with a great deal of polish and refinement.  A point can legitimately be made that SkyDrift pretty quickly runs out of variety, in terms of its maps, planes, and powerups, but it is a budget title, so it's a bit unfair to hold the small size of the game against it -- I'm more pleased by a limited but well-done game than a sprawling one that's buggy and barely-playable.","April 4, 2015","true","1.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The single player almost as fun as the multiplayer. However, the game really is too small for it's price. There are only six different maps in the game, with some areanas available as dlc. Even with the ability to race the maps backwards it gets old quickly. The multiplayer, while fun, is almost never available due to a distinct lack of players. This is partialy due to the lack of control that the game gives you in selecting a mp game. SkyDrift aoutomaticaly creates lobbys for racers rather then having a server list. There is no chat, in lobby or in game. And, after all plyers have readied, there is a one minute before every race. Also some skins will glitch and make you invisable to other players during races. The arcade controls, while they usualy make it easier on normal races, make it verry hard to fly in arena mode. The game is a bit over priced by itself for it's size. The dlc really should not be dlc but part of the actual game. Dispite these problems, the game is really quite fun. Don't expect to be able to play alot of multiplayer unless you know several people who also own the game. Over all, recomended if you have a lot of friends to play it with.","June 4, 2014","true","24.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The game concept itself is great, a bit like other light-hearted racer/shooters such as Mashed or even Mario Kart. The single player offers a few hours of fun races against AIs. But there are two game-breaking shortcomings.\n\nFirst, it could do with some kind of balance mechanism, like Mario Kart's "catch up" bullet bill. If players get separated from each, they'll just never meet again, leading to a really boring race. This is true for the AIs and human players alike.\n\nSecond, a fun racing game like this really needs to be played against humans, but it's so hard to. There's no single-machine (splitscreen or Micro Machines style) mode, so you can only play against someone else with the same game. There's nobody online at all, because it's such a small game. Even if you can find a friend to invite to play, the inviting-through-steam mechanism is really fiddly to get working. And then there's no humans-plus-AIs mode, so you end up with only two people in a race, and because of the first problem you might only see the other player for the first half a lap.\n\nThe single-player is reasonable for a quid or two, but the lost promise of what multiplayer might have been spoilt the enjoyment for me. I bought it having read earlier reviews complaining about empty servers, but hoping to play it with friends at LAN parties &c., but even that's no use: no splitscreen, no LAN play, and lack of player interaction in-race.","November 8, 2014","false","5.4"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

I'm somewhere in the middle. SkyDrift is not a *bad* game, it's just... not good enough.\n\nSkyDrift is a racing game that has the feel of Hydro Thunder but is basically a car combat game with airplanes. The power-up system reminds me a lot of Bizarre Creations' "Blur".\n\nHaving tried the demo for SkyDrift back when it came out, I was eager to get the full game, but now that I have it, it doesn't seem to be holding up to extended singleplayer play. Courses get VERY narrow, and VERY winding, yet your planes do not often feel up to the task of maneuvering through them easily. Presumably this is where the racing game element comes in, and you're expected to slow down around corners... but given the intrinsic nature of flying airplanes, slowing down means losing altitude, and I instinctively never want to slow down for fear of crashing.\n\nThe controls in general could be a lot better. In a lot of other games, flying planes usually has a "Easy" mode (where it auto-levels you out, assists your flight, etc.) and a "Simulation" mode (where you have full control over your plane). SkyDrift doesn't give you an option and is stuck in that aforementioned "Easy" mode. Sometimes I don't feel entirely in control of my plane, especially when making the namesake "sky drifts" - holding the right stick makes my plane drift and sway in ways that don't always make me feel comfortable. It also doesn't actually seem to modify my turning radius very much, or at least, not enough to make some of the sharp turns it asks of you.\n\nI'm also just getting bored with the gameplay. I'm about halfway through the fourth tier of tracks (apparently about 50% of the way through the game's singleplayer content), and so far the game has not provided much in the way of diversity. The artificial intelligence is also reaching a point of frustration - in the last race I was in before writing this review, I finished third place as 1st and 2nd were so far ahead of the rest of the pack that it was impossible to catch up to them (even after I broke away from the pack and spammed boost).\n\nThey are so close to having something special here, but it just falls a little too short. It just needs a little more balance, a little more polish, and a little more content. Maybe it's better in multiplayer, but I think I might be the only person on my friends list who owns it (though to be honest, I haven't exactly checked).","May 15, 2014","false","1.6"," 30 of 56 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","30","56","0","0"

A Solid and Enjoyable Arcade Racer.Genre: Arcade Racer\nDeveloped and Published by: Digital Reality & Kalypso Media Digital.\nPlatform: Windows, Xbox 360 and PS3.\nBusiness Model: Base Game + DLC For Multiplayer Levels\nCopy Gifted By A Friend Read the full blog review here[kingisaaclinksr.com]\n\nOverall Gameplay Thoughts\nSkyDrift is a great looking, fast action, arcade racing game. It's chaotic, intense and skillful. Single player offers plenty of content and planes to choose from. It offers beautiful vistas of places to fly through and the world feels very organic and alive. It reminds me of Mario Kart mixed with Diddy Kong Racing. The three different modes of play, Power, Speed and Survival, keep it interesting if you want to change it up. Power is where you have the ability to use powerups. Speed takes powerups out and survival is about making it the longest. There's a good amount of powerups, all sorts of different planes to choose from and a decent amount of racing tracks to chew on. The various different types of planes vary from flighty and twitchy, to heavy and slow but still remain balanced enough for engaging races everytime. The AI gets lots of help with rubberbanding and teleporting but it's still possible to beat it. It's just really aggravating. The game is definitely best played against others though. There's a good amount of variety for such a small budgeted game.\n\nVisuals\nThe vibrant graphics also make it a feast for the eyes as you fly around in the well crafted planes. From the cold icy tundras, to the Mediterranean waterfalls to the deserts, the game has some really gorgeous places you fly around in.\n\nMultiplayer\nInitially at launch, SkyDrift's multiplayer was broken. It was plagued with lobby issues, lots of lag and desync problems. Fortunately, it seems that multiplayer has been fixed. Not sure when and for how long, but it works again. That being said, it could easily break itself, so, that's something to keep in mind. Getting a lobby with friends going is pretty easy as it ties itself in with Steam. I should note that the game has a ridiculously long wait of 60 seconds to start up a game. Not really sure why and it gets reset everytime someone decides they want to fly something else. So you could be waiting at the lobby for a while.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nSkydrift is one of my favorite racers I've had the pleasure of playing in the past couple of years. The devs shot themselves in the foot by not having multiplayer be up to snuff but that somehow fixed itself. If you need a new arcade racer, SkyDrift is the one to pick up.\n\nRead this review and more on A Paladin Without A Crusade[wp.me]","May 21, 2014","true","12.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Multiplayer can be played in the base game but bying the DLCs will give you Deathmatch and Team deathmatch plus some additional planes to fly with. The game suffers from lack of players now in the year 2016 but there are some communities and steam groups where you can find players even now. The graphics are perfectly fine and the game runs very well on a bit older hardware. All in all a very balanced game for casual gaming, the in-game achievements are also quite challenging to collect and the AI are quite challenging as well. If you can find it on sales I do recommend you check it out.","April 30","true","35.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Unlike most racing titles, where you drive cars, here you're flying airplanes of varying types.\n\nThe first thing I noted was the graphics, which in my opinion, were fantastic. Admittedly, it's sometimes difficult to notice detail when you're flying at high speeds through caverns, dodging enemy fire and launching missiles their way in return. Regardless, the visuals are impressive.\n\nThe audio is decent. Nothing to complain about, but nothing to rave about either. The music is good and the sound effects work nicely. My one gripe (and it's a minor one) is the announcer, whose voice is a bit annoying. Then again, I generally dislike announcers in any game, so take my opinion with a grain of salt.\n\nThe controls are tight and responsive with a gamepad, which is something you'll want. The keyboard works well too, but there are times you'll wish you had an analogue stick. I don't know if flight sticks are supported.\n\nThe single player part of the game has practice runs, time trials, and real races. The multiplayer component is supposedly similar. I wouldn't know since I haven't tried it. I imagine that, like any racing game, lag can have a huge impact on racing performance.\n\nOne last thing I'd like to comment on is the design of the planes you fly. They're often odd and sometimes outlandish. I like that, given the fact the game isn't supposed to be realistic. It also reminds me of an old PC game entitled Crimson Skies, which handled similarly, although the game's content was much different.\n\nAll in all, I'd recommend SkyDrift if you like racing games (with combat) and you're ltired of driving cars. Just don't mistake this game for a serious simulation, as it's most definitely arcade action all the way.","March 11, 2014","true","0.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Yes.\n\nI had a great time playing Skydrift, and while I'm not the best pilot for flight games, I have no problem playing arcade titles such as this and Starfox.\n\nIt's a "Mario Kart" style racing game, that is reminescent of Blur, but with planes, and many have compared this to Crimson Skies which I have not had the opportunity to play. Besides your expected steering, acceleration, and power user controls, you use have the ability to twist into the knife edge postion, basically rolling your plane left or right laterally (DO A BARREL ROLL!) which helps you fit into tight openings and turn corners. The game says you need this for some turns, but I think you can brake and readjust if you real careful if you really wanted to (though, that is much slower and a terrible idea for later stages unless you have no other option). You also can "burn" power ups to add to your boost, which is a great mechanic requiring the player to use strategy - do you attack a racer, defend yourself, or speed up? You'll generally find it better to speed up more often than not, but you will definitely have to defend yourself in mid-stage races and attack in all races.\n\nThere's only a few power ups compared to Mario Kart, but each can be stacked to a second level, creating another layer strategy, such as more mines, stronger bullets, or a bigger area of effect for the shockwave. Of course, you can just burn those power ups for a larger than normal boost as well. You can also perform "stunts" such as hugging the ground, drafting opponents, going through tight spaces, or damaging enemies to gain boost.\n\nThe modes available, though limited are rather fun. The standard race are Power Races, as you race a level using power ups to boost and dogfight to slow enemies down, since you can't permanently stop any racer since everybody has unlimited respanws (excluding Elimination). Speed Race involve removing those powerups, and instead, racing through rings that can speed you up like the ones found in a later mission of Retrovirus.

Yes.\n\nI had a great time playing Skydrift, and while I'm not the best pilot for flight games, I have no problem playing arcade titles such as this and Starfox.\n\nIt's a "Mario Kart" style racing game, that is reminescent of Blur, but with planes, and many have compared this to Crimson Skies which I have not had the opportunity to play. Besides your expected steering, acceleration, and power user controls, you use have the ability to twist into the knife edge postion, basically rolling your plane left or right laterally (DO A BARREL ROLL!) which helps you fit into tight openings and turn corners. The game says you need this for some turns, but I think you can brake and readjust if you real careful if you really wanted to (though, that is much slower and a terrible idea for later stages unless you have no other option). You also can "burn" power ups to add to your boost, which is a great mechanic requiring the player to use strategy - do you attack a racer, defend yourself, or speed up? You'll generally find it better to speed up more often than not, but you will definitely have to defend yourself in mid-stage races and attack in all races.\n\nThere's only a few power ups compared to Mario Kart, but each can be stacked to a second level, creating another layer strategy, such as more mines, stronger bullets, or a bigger area of effect for the shockwave. Of course, you can just burn those power ups for a larger than normal boost as well. You can also perform "stunts" such as hugging the ground, drafting opponents, going through tight spaces, or damaging enemies to gain boost.\n\nThe modes available, though limited are rather fun. The standard race are Power Races, as you race a level using power ups to boost and dogfight to slow enemies down, since you can't permanently stop any racer since everybody has unlimited respanws (excluding Elimination). Speed Race involve removing those powerups, and instead, racing through rings that can speed you up like the ones found in a later mission of Retrovirus.

The controls.\nPresumably none of the developers had ever flown a plane, played a flight sim or even tried a flight-based arcade game before.\nYou can put the plane in knife-edge flight not by using the aileron (roll left/right) controls, but a completely different set of inputs. I can sort of live with that. But when you ARE in knife-edge flight, the elevator/aileron controls behave in the same sense as they do in level flight. i.e. moving left will turn your plane horizontally left, not roll it. And pulling back on the stick doesn't put you in a tight turn; it moves the plane vertically upwards.\nThis is so counter-intuitive and WRONG I'm almost reluctant to play it any more, lest I get used to flying like this and find myself incapable of controlling any of the other plane sims/games/RC aircraft I own.\nI understand this isn't trying to be a sim, but even the most arcady of flight games get these simple inputs right.","October 18, 2014","false","0.7"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

I wish there was more levels tho and maybe some nighttime courses with enviromental hazards thrown in to add to the challenege kinda like Fuel. Game looks and runs great overall.

Sure there are various weapon powerups, but unlike most kart games, they are almost secondary to the controls themselves.\n\nThere are virtually no "blue shell" woes to ruin the experience. Choose from a variety of different planes, all of which handle differently, and fly your way through varied and beautiful landscapes and obstacles. You'll have to actively navigate through a variety of different areas in order to survive each race and come out on top.\n\nThe powerups are interesting and varied, but none of them feel overly cheap and ridiculously broken. It's refreshing to see a game in this genre that is mostly based on skill first, luck second.","August 11, 2012","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A physics-light combat racing game with plenty of speed, stunts and destruction, SkyDrift would have been right at home on the old home consoles.

I wish there was more levels tho and maybe some nighttime courses with enviromental hazards thrown in to add to the challenege kinda like Fuel. Game looks and runs great overall.

I got it because me and friends really enjoyed Blur, this game is very similar to that.  The gameplay is great - I actually usually play hardcore flight sims - and it's cute the way this game uses some analogues to actual flight (rolling your plane to allow sharper manouvers than simply yawing).  Vertical movement also gives it another dimension (literally) than Blur has and they make the most of it too with some great maps.  It's a blast to play and the sensation of speed is excellent.  I thought being locked to 30fps would really offend me but it doesn't actually bother me.  The motion blur is very well done and covers the missing frames.  Graphically it's really nice all together - and the sensation of movement is very visceral.\n\nOkay now the problem.  There's no skirmish type mode where you can fly against the AI with human players "co-op"ing along with you.  Blur or Gas Guzzlers totally wipes the floor with this game here.  Basically I want to play this with my gf and gang up on the AI.  And there is no such game mode :(\n\nSo you have a fun single player campaign that will give you a few hours fun.  And an empty Online multiplayer.  BUT no ability to play with your pals or on a LAN against the AI - this really is a shame as otherwise I'd heartily recommend this.

Wait, didn't they do this with Diddy Kong Racing? Well, I guess it's Diddy Kong Racing, with only planes, limited content, and clap trap's voice actor. It's graphics are very smooth, and the controls are extremely nice. I hit more walls than I care to count, but it's still a lot of fun. I wish it's community was larger. I think I've played against 2 other people before. The only major downside to this game is, it's limited selection of maps. You can do them forward, or backwards. This feels like one of those arcade games you'd find in a theator with those racing jet-skis', but with planes. I don't think the devs ever expected anyone to actually play this game for as long as I have, so maybe the lack of content is a lack of player base interest? *Slams fist on table,* I demand more maps to race on, and a broader internet community!","May 12","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The best way to describe it is Mario Kart with fighter planes. The single player mode has six tracks (12 if you count reverse mode) and three race types: (1) power (like Mario Kart - race around the track and collect power-ups that allow you to shoot at your competitors); (2) survivor (same as power, but instead of a fixed number of laps the player in last place gets eliminated every 30 seconds or so); and (3) speed (power-ups are replaced by boost rings that increase the speed and difficulty of racing around the course). The game mixes and matches these three play types and the 6/12 tracks with varying levels of AI difficulty to create a single player campaign consisting of about 40 events, and for each event you can choose between about 10 planes with varying specs (some are faster, some are more maneuverable, etc). The tracks are spectacular and the controls and overall gameplay are also great.\n\nWith respect to single player mode, my only complaints are that there are only 6 tracks and the "campaign" is very loosely put together. There's no story, you don't even need to finish first in an event to progress to the next, and by the time you've completed the first 10 or so of the campaign races you've already seen all six tracks.\n\nWith respect to multiplayer, there doesn't seem to be much of an online community left, but you can play with friends that also have the game.\n\n8/10","May 16","true","29.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
