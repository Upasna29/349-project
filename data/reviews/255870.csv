The controls are simple. Left stick for movement, right stick for aim. Right trigger for shooting, holding the trigger will unleash missiles. The catch is that missiles will overheat your ship. Cave ship. Not a space ship. The left trigger sends out a grappling hook to pick up stranded miners, which is the objective of the game.  When you get the stranded miners, it opens a door to the next level. Each 'stage' has a few levels in it.\n\nThe real selling point of this game is the incredible interaction that you have with the environment. You can destroy soft terrain. Your bullets will take out chunks and not the entire terrain / wall. There is water that is fluid and dynamic. It will also cool down your ship when it overheats. There are enemies and lava. The lava flows just as the water, makes your ship overheat and when it meets water, they bond together to form soft terrain that you can destroy. Its such a nice dynamic.\n\nThere are powerups to keep your ship cool from the lava's heat. There are objects that you can grapple and tow around, such as a water bomb, good for drowning a volcano. There is a watercan object that you fill in water or lava, and when you take it out, it showers whatever liquid you have in it. Again, there is a lot of interactivity in the game.\n\nThis is a game that rewards and encourages exploration. If it looks like there is a way off screen, that's probably a secret area with the game's main collectable diamonds. Well you need diamonds to progress past a certain stage. You will have to go back and play each stage a few times in order to collect enough hidden diamonds. While it might seem like a downer to replay stages and levels, its all fun. Nothing seems like a chore. Its soothing, relaxing, nice to look at and with the incredible interactivity that you have with your environment, no playthrough is really the same.\n\nOn top of it all, the game sets itself apart with its art style. Its a beautiful, simple style instead of typical dualstick shooters that overload you on bright visual effects.\n\nIt is well worth the price and you can probably pick it up in an indie bundle. I've also got the sequil on PSN and personally, I think this it better.","February 5, 2014","true","3.1"," 34 of 38 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","34","38","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/recommended/255870/","Maxmetpt","Maxmetpt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/","704 products in account","PixelJunk Shooter is a twin-stick shooter, with a very big focus on physics (specifically fluids). While exploring the underground caves of a planet, you'll have to interact with lava, water, liquid metal, ice and rock in order to save the scientists who are now trapped.\n\nThe story is basically that. You're in a ship, trying to save every scientist. And also collecting hidden gems. Whole it may seem a game about exploration, it didn't quite get to that point, in my opinion. But more on that later.\n\nLet's start with presentation.\nThe graphics' style is very minimalistic, with soft colours, and yet, it looks great, in my opinion.\nIt certainly looks unique, and the fluids especially, give it a a special look.\nThe enemies have a mechanical feel to them, but it fits, along with the Boss Fights.\n\nThe music was less of a standout for me, but it was certainly not bad. Just a bit more faint than I'm used to, staying in the background for the most part. It helped with the light-hearted exploration-y atmosphere, I think it was well chosen for the game they were going for.\nThe sound effects were in the same vein.\n\n\nHow's the gameplay, then?\nFirst off, the game is divided into 3 areas, each with a few levels. Each level also has about 4 (I think) areas to explore, each of them self contained, and fairly small.\nThe first area is more vulcanic, the second, deeper, is full of ice, and the third, the deepest, has an industrial feel to it.\nEach of them has different mechanics associated with the physics. These are all connected to the area it's set in.\n\nYou control a little space ship, propelled by thrusters. The movement feels quite great actually, with momentum very notable in the ships handling. It feels great, even though there aren't section to challenge your pilloting skills. It's still good that the tight control is there while you're just flying around.\n\nThen, you have a Hook/Tractor thing to pick up the gems and the scientists you find, and you also have missiles, to destroy rocks and your enemies.\n\nThere are also several different types of ships. You'll find modifiers in specific points of the levels. For the standard ship, lava with overheat you, while water will cool you off. Each time you get hit, you don't instantly die, but your heat will rise substancially. To survive, you can either back away, or dive into water.\nBesides, you'll find ship modifiers around the levels, for when you need to actually progress the levels.\nThere is a Magma ship, that shoots lava, a Water ship that shoots water, and can pull ice with is hook, there's an inverted ship, that is hurt by water, and can dive on lava, and there's also a Magnetic ship that repels the liquid metal. These sound, and play really well, but they're highly limited to the levels. You'll only have access to them in the exact section that you need them, and there's no action from the player in discerning which ship he needs for the given section, unfortunately.\n\nIn each level, you'll try to find the scientists. You have to deal with all of them in each area to unlock the next one (either save them, or kill them). Every time a scientist dies, you'll lose a life. Your limit is 5, but you'll gain another one each time you collect 100 coins (these are spread around the levels, and also dropped by the enemies).\nYou also try to find gems, that are used to unlock levels, or just for achievements. Unfortunately, these are very easy to miss by mistake, and you'll have to replay the whole level if you want to 100% it (it is NOT needed, though. I did some thorough exploration the first time around, found every secret area, and still missed a couple of gems in many of the levels. I never had the need to replay levels to proceed though, so the game was designed to keep you going naturally, saving these for the completionists. That's really good, in my view!).\nThere are also Special Scientists that you collect in your Gallery (yeah, not creepy at all), and these will talk to you, giving you a bit of backstory into their expedition.\n\nThe base of the game is out of the way, now.\n\nThis game reminded my a bit of Waking Mars. Besides both being about exploring the caves, both are very focused about combining elements (in WM, it's mostly interacting with the creatures, in PJShooter, is with the fluids). While Waking Mars gave you a real feeling of discovery, learning about each species and all about their lives and interactions, that isn't very present in PixelJunk Shooter.\nPixelJunk Shooter is a very straightforward game, and also not very challenging. It's something to enjoy casually.\n\nThe level design was pretty good, in my opinion, providing good areas to experiment with the fluids, and learn new mechanics without a wall of text. While that was all there and great, the whole game felt like a very big tutorial, in a way. Everything was subtle, but not challenging, and specially not giving the player much freedom.\nYou'll have everything delivered into your hands when you need it, there's no puzzle solving, or anything, which wasn't what I was expecting. So, if you're looking for an experience of discovery and learning, go play Waking Mars.\nIf, on the other hand, you want a laid back twin stick shooter with cool physics, give this one a try.\n\nThe Boss Fights were the funnest part of the game, for me. They weren't very hard either, as you were pretty comfortable even after getting hit (as long as you were careful). But that comfort gave you the time to learn the Bosses patterns without it feeling frustrating, and led to interesting fights.\n\nI found the game enjoyable, certainly, but in a way that I wasn't expecting. It's very, very linear. There isn't trial and error to understand the fluids, or anything. It's not about learning the mechanics, and then applying them into more complex puzzles. It's mostly about learning on the go, always with simple puzzles. And to be honest... that's fine.\nIt may not be what you're looking for, but it's good that it exists, for people who do. And it's a very well done game for its purpose.\n\nIt's also very cheap on sale and you can easily get it. Go ahead and give this one a try if it sounds appealing!","June 23, 2014","true","8.1"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","20","23","0","0"

Keep in mind this is a simplified version of the game, as you progress the game introduces some new mechanics and ships to keep things varied.\n\n+ Combing the different liquids together is really cool and adds a fresh new gameplay idea, combining different liquids together provides different results.\n\n+Graphics fit the enviroment nicely\n\n+ Some cool boss battles\n\n+ Achievements are easy to get and shouldn't provide too much trouble.\n\n\nThe Bad:\n\n- The game doesn't really take its ideas far enough leaving a very easy game.  The game doesn't get that much harder as you progress either. I was a bit disappointed when I beat the game.\n\n-Roughly 3 hours long, 5-7 hours if you go for achievements.\n\nConclusion\n\nAlthough I had fun, I felt the game was a bit basic for my taste. I would have liked the game to be a bit more challenging especially in regards to the puzzles as the game does introduce some cool elements later on in the game.","August 24, 2014","true","7.6"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","17","19","0","0"

While I am not a fan of the shooting in the game I don't mind the exploring or puzzle parts of the game and the few times the shooting/fighting shines is during the few boss fights in the game.\n\nA pretty straight forward list of achievements mostly being for collecting the various scientists and gems in the levels which can be fairly challenging to find (at least the gems). The game also has an achievements for finding all secret areas so exploring is recommended. There are really only two achievements that might take some extra work and that is the big kill grind (1000 enemies) and an achievement for collecting 100 coins in a single spin. The later might take a few tries but can be made easier by using a guide to check out ideal spots for it.\n\nTime to 100%: 9 hours","February 22, 2014","true","8.6"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","0"

The games difficulty is not very high but unless you know what you are doing enemies may surprise you.

Very little complaints from me as everything hits the mark amazingly well, though the final boss is a bit cheap at times and the game can be finished in around three hours.\n\nSo highly recommended.","October 21, 2014","true","9.1"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/255870/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2975 products in account","I remember Pixeljunk Shooter being good fun a few years ago when I played it on the PS3. But playing it now it managed to annoy me sometimes. Some of the deaths are annoying, sometimes even cheap, resulting in you having to replay entire sections because of one tiny mistake. And no, the sections aren't all that big and can be completed in just a few minutes. But it's frustrating when you're almost near the end of a level.\n\nIt's also the only thing that annoyed me, because what you have here is a cute looking, physics based, twin stick action game (it's not really a twin stick shooter, so naming it that would do it injustice) where you save trapped workers and try to find as many gems as possible. Why is the last one so important ? Because you can only progress until you have a certain amount of these gems. Still, it's not that time consuming, because the game can easily be finished (not 100%)  in 3 or 4 hours. There are 3 worlds and they consists of several levels each, and each levels consists of several sections. At the end of the world there'll be a boss fight. Those can be a bit difficult, but collecting enough stars allows you to earn extra lives. You'll rarely have to replay an entire level. Anyway, the environmental puzzles are fun to solve, and it's cool to look for secrets (I don't know if you can really call them secrets, though).\n\nAsk me if this is the best Q-Games/Pixeljunk game and I'd have to say no. That honor still belongs to Pixeljunk Monsters. Shooter is a close second, though.\nBut ask me if it's worth it and I'd say yes.\n\n[Rating: 78/100]","December 19, 2013","true","5.1"," 15 of 22 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","15","22","0","0"

I really liked Eden so was excited to try out Shooter.  At first I really enjoyed it. I liked the graphical style, the overall gameplay, and the fluid mechanics and interactions are super cool.  But then tedium set in.  None of the levels are difficult.  I probably died like 20 times in the entire run through, and most of those were to bosses or me just being lazy.  It's also pretty much the same thing over and over with slight variations, and I don't really like the necessary compulsion to collect jewels in order to progress through levels. That requirement seems like it's there solely to make a short game longer. It doesn't add anything to the experience.  The combat is also pretty repetitive.  It never presents a challenge and the enemies pretty much just exist to give you something to do other than collect jewels and scientists and avoid environmental hazards.\n\nAlso, the music just doesn't make any sense. It feels like it was made for another game and accidentally inserted into Shooter. It's out of context.\n\nAnd then there's the fact that this game came out for PS3 in 2009 and is selling for $9 (the Steam release date is Nov 11, 2013). There's even a sequel that came out in 2011. I didn't realize that and I guess that's my fault, but come on.\n\nThe game isn't terrible, but it's not particularly good either.  You might enjoy it if you want a casual, easy, pick up and play type of game and like the graphical style. As I said, the fluid physics and interactions were really inventive and used well.  I would have like PJ to have harnessed that a bit better to make this a deeper game.

The boss fights are awesome and the best part of the game. There are a few negatives. Sometimes they don't explain powers, like how once you get water you can pull ice with your crane. It was the first level I got the ability to spray water and there was no inclination I would manipulate ice with a crane. There were a few others parts with this that could have given better direction. Also it was annoying that you had to get a certain number of diamonds to move on. They are hidden around the level, and should have been used for  treasure hunting for the leaderboards or they should have had the threshold lower. I don't want to have to replay entire levels to search a few parts for every single inch of the level for something I may have missed just to continue the game.

You control a yellow ship which is sent to help out some scientists on a planet in which after alot of digging something went wrong. The story is told when you rescue certain survivors, colored ones, which upon pickup will show up a text screen telling something that happened previously during the excavations. You progress through the game by picking up gems and survivors which will then unlock new areas for you to play. Gameplay wise the ship control is really smooth and satisfying with a some pretty decent shooting, your ship has 2 standard attacks, one that shoots projectiles if you keep tapping the attack button and if you hold it down you'll launch homing missiles. The level design and the visuals are pretty well done, considering it's a 2D game and as you progress to later levels the difficulty really ramps up at a fair pace keeping the game challenging even when you already master the game. Besides having to kill enemies on each level and rescuing survivors and gathering gems you'll find yourself most of the times trying to solve some sort of puzzles in which you need to manipulate various type of terrain either it is ice or rock and liquids such as water and lava or even gas or deadly black goo. Overall PixelJunk Shooter is a pretty fun game to play when you're bored or if you're looking for something casual, you can easily beat it in around 6 hours or so and it's a pretty good time. If you're a fan of PixelJunk games you'll probably also enjoy this one and if you do enjoy this one but haven't played Monsters or Eden you should totally check those two.","February 15, 2014","true","6.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Still one of the best games on the Playstation network it has finally been made available to PC gamers. Now you can find out what all the fuss is about as you pilot your little ship through a host of physics and element based levels.\n\nThe plot, such as it is, has you sent in to rescue your crew mates after mysterious goings on while mining on the planet of Apoxus Prime. To do this you have to fly your craft around tight underground caverns while using water, lava and magnetic black liquids to your advantage. It’s reminiscent of Thrust with its inertia and gravity based gameplay but your craft will stay still if left alone. Your also won’t die from hitting walls (which is a good thing or it would have been nigh on impossible).\n\nThe game is a 2D styled shooter where you manoeuvre your ship around a section of an enclosed map. Normally you will have to get water to turn lava to rock or lava to melt ice or some other combination of dropping one liquid onto another. You’re doing this because you need to get to and rescue all the lost crew members in each area. If too many of them die you have to start the level again. It’s wonderfully inventive and a whole lot of fun and there are hidden areas and diamonds to collect along the way as well.\n\nThe level design is nigh on perfect throughout the game and the difficulty curve is just about right. The huge boss monsters found at the end of each world may cause some frustration but they provide tense and heroic showdowns of David and Goliath proportions and once you work them out shouldn’t take too long to get past.\n\nShooter is split into three main areas each consisting of five levels. There are the initial outer rocky areas, the ice caves and then the mine. Each individual level is split into sections which require everyone to be rescued before a bulk head opens to the next.  Each has its own tricks and traps and will keep you on your toes throughout.\n\nYou will also need to think quickly as the game has a wonderful way of getting you to forget what you’ve just learnt. For instance, for the first area you are trying to keep away from lava (overheating causes you to crash), but then in the ice caves you’ll come across and inversion suite which makes lava cool you down and water heat you up.\n\nIt’s a game that keeps throwing new ideas and things at you to keep you interested. The water suit and lava suit are just the start and you’ll soon be switching around and dealing with freezing lakes and clouds of gas as well as the usual lava and water. The key thing is that everything stays fun and creative throughout. Once you’ve completed the game you’ll probably want to dive back in to further explore the levels and find all the missing diamonds and any crew you missed along the way.\n\nPixelJunk Shooter is a game we’re still playing on the PS3 to this day. The fact a whole new audience can now pick it up is great and this really is one of the best games of its type. Q-Games have crafted something special here and the years have done nothing to diminish its appeal. It’s perhaps a shame that the PixelJunk Shooter 2 wasn’t included as well (as it is pretty much part 1 and 2 of the same game), but we’ll be first in line to get it when it arrives.\n\nThis was always going to be a certified hit with us as long as nothing had gone wrong in the conversion and from our experience this offers all the fun of the original. PC gamers really need to play this as it’s simply a masterfully executed, great little game packed with more invention and ideas than most massive AAA releases can even come close to.\n\nOverall 9/10","February 4, 2014","true","4.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Instead, you're flying a space ship through mines, rescuing people and dealing with fluid dynamics of lava, water, and tar, as well as some gaseous exhalations.

And it's really pretty enjoyable; there are three episodes, with six chapters each, each of which has several separate sequences, so there's a fair bit of game here, especially if you want to collect all the treasures (I didn't).

There's a variety of enemies with different types of attacks though most of the actual threat comes from the environments themselves. You have to dodge the lava, the black goo and the exploding gases and carefully but quickly wind your way through the mazes, rescuing crew members. The different suits you can put on in certain levels certainly shakes up the gameplay quite a bit. The secret treasures are also fun to look out for. The crowning glory are the 3 bosses. Each require very different strategies and defeating them is indeed a challenge. You have to look out for the weak spots which usually glow but as with the rest of the game, the real challenge lies not in hitting the spots, but dodging the environment and the other enemies.\n\nThe graphics are good with a very colorful style. The colors were chosen with great care though since you very rarely confuse the foreground with the background. the colours also help in identifying the types of surfaces which greatly aids in knowing exactly where you want to go.\n\nSpecial mention goes to the soundtrack which is a mix of many different and weird styles with lots of random sounds and speech bytes for added measure. Makes for a nice atmosphere.\n\nThe one con would be that the story ends very abruptly and is primed for a sequel.\n\nIf you;re a fan of twin stick shooters, make sure not to miss this!","January 9, 2014","true","7.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Don't look to it like it's  a buyers guide, because it isn't.  I'm gonna tell you the thing you should have to make your experience optimal according to what i have experienced with it.\n\nAlright, let's begin:\n\nFor this game I reccomend you have the following:\n1. A basic-intermediate understanding of low gravity physics.\n2.A headset with 7.1 surround sound support.\n3.A good sense of patience.\n\nNow I will explain my reasoning for the above points:\nA.) This game has a very developed interpretation of low gravity and hover-based physics principles. The experience becomes a whole lot more frustrating if you are able to predict where objects are going to go based on your actions.\nB.) The sounds in this game are extremly ambient and echo-esque, coupled with the music that is very slow and booming creates a great experience when listened to in surround sound. I can't back this up with actual proof, just trust me on this one.\nC.)This game is incredibly slow pased and inuitive, compounded by the trial-and-error based level design demands alot of patience and retrys from the player before handing the player an award. This is the clincher for some people, because even if you have the other 2 things on this list, your personal level of patience will make-or-break determine whether or not you enjoy this game. If you are the kind of person who gets frustrated easily and is looking for a short, easy experience,  DO NOT BUY THIS GAME\n\nAs a concluding point, i would like to point out that this game has local co-op, meaning you can bring a friend along to make the game more fun. Bear in mind, for anyone who doesn't know, local co-op means that you only need to have one copy of the game to play with a friend.\n\nThis concludes my experience optimization/guide thingy.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyrilpanda/recommended/255870/","cyrilpanda","Cyril","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyrilpanda/","596 products in account","As appears to be the PixelJunk formula, this game takes a basic concept (twin-stick shooter) and makes something unique out of it. PixelJunk Shooter is a shooter, but also an exploration game and a puzzle game at the same time.\n\nThere are 15 levels and each is pretty decently sized, with numerous hidden gems and secret rooms to find as well as 35 survivors to rescue. Or maybe not, because they are very fragile and one shot or one drop of magma can kill them, costing you a life. Yes, lives are how many survivors you accidentally kill, instead of your ship itself having lives. Generally though it's actually pretty hard to game over unless you're trying to, aside from the few instances where survivors can die just because of bad placement (there's only like 2 or 3 of these, but they're really annoying :T)\n\nThere are three main worlds and each has several gimmicks of its own. The first world introduces all of the main mechanics, the second introduces ice mechanics and alternate suits, and the third introduces oil, switches, and all sorts of mechanical devices. This keeps the game fresh in each new world, and each world also ends with a pretty nice-sized boss that tends to be somewhat of a puzzle boss as well. The shooting is generally well-executed, enemies are fair and you have several methods of killing them all; normal shots, homing missiles, and environmental kills all come in handy depending on the situation.\n\nThe health system in this game is also fairly unique; it's entirely based on heat. Being near lava heats your ship up, as does being surrounded in gas. Taking a shot gives you a fair bit of heat. And touching magma is almost always instant death... but you don't die unless you're already on fire AND you touch the ground, so you can be saved from near death by a conveniently placed pool of water. It's a reeeally neat mechanic and one I've never seen before, and it's executed really well (and eventually, inverted... ehehe, but the inverter suit actually makes no sense, to be honest).\n\nThe gameplay is pretty smart, the mechanics are pretty original, the length is fairly decent, and it's generally pretty fun. Twin-stick shooters don't tend to be a genre I play much but with how interesting they made this one I ended up liking it a fair bit. I might even play PixelJunk Monsters at some point even though I dislike tower defense games because, hey, I'm sure I'll get an interesting experience out of it regardless. Q Games really knows what the hell they're doing and it's a shame their games don't get much buzz.\n\nBrief comment: I like this game more for what it does than for how much I enjoyed it, which is kind of an exception to my usual rule. It's not *that* fun but certainly not unfun, though there are a few instances of tedious design. I respect this game more than I like it, but I'd certainly be up for playing Shooter 2 if it came to steam. Really I just want to keep supporting this dev since it'd be hard to be disappointed by them.","January 6, 2015","true","7.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The graphics when you look at static picture dont look like much. When I first looked at the static photos I was like great another ugly looking indie game.  However the only true part is the indie part. The game looks great in motion. Plenty of fluid water and fluid lava mixed in with great looking colors. The game is amazing in motion.\n\nThe controls work smooth as butter right out of the box. Surprised  me. A lot of indie games just cant seem to understand how a xbox 360 controller works. A taxi game on steam cannot figure out how an xbox controller should work and no its not crazy  taxi that works fine. Another taxi game I wont mention since its so terrible on steam.\n\nThe gameplay is simple and fun. Collect or kill your men and when they have all been killed or rescued the exit will open. They even have a leaderboard. I am ranked in the 10k lot. You also have to collect diamonds to move to the next stage. Open enough stages and a boss comes out. Very cool. I enjoyed the gameplay a lot it doesnt require elite skills to have fun. Super meat boy I am looking at you.\n\nAlso it does have co op but I cant comment on that as I have yet to play it.  So over all a winner of a game in my book. The only negative I have heard about this game is the length of it. Will post more later when I finish it.","December 6, 2014","true","2.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Although lightly present, has almost no effect on the majority of the game.\n-Graphics are very simplistic but presented in a cohesive way. Not great, but certainly not bad.\n\nCONS:\n-Permanent Pixel Junk banner in the bottom of the screen while you play. SERIOUSLY?\n-Gameplay is very slow and tedious\n-Boring level design (game has good mechanics, but the levels do very little with them)\n-Ship accelerates too slow.\n-It "feels" like a mobile/tablet game. (Ok this is probably just my feeling, but the level design, ship acceleration, and a few other menu aspects all felt like they were designed for touch based devices to me)\n\nMost of the game is just flying around the levels picking up the humans and avoiding heat with the occasional bad guy to shoot at (with no real reason to since they respawn randomly anyway). In itself it isn't a bad concept, and the controls presented are fairly clean, but the game is just boring to play.\n\nThe shooter aspect is a complete afterthought in the level design and given the ships slow acceleration, most levels are just a slow trudge collecting the humans before an exit.\n\nThis could be a decent game if they incorporate the shooter elements and seriously ramp up the ships acceleration, but as it is, there are a lot better options out there. Also, that banner is really ridiculous. You don't need to advertise at me while I'm playing your game.\n\nIf you are looking for a really easy, super slow, casual game then this might be it.\nBut given the game's name and advertising, I can't recommend it for what it wants to be.","February 3, 2015","false","1.1"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

The developers did a great job at picking that as their main feature and explored all its different aspects (attract, repel, solid, gaseous, etc).\n\nThe development direction ended up with a simple and short game but quite rewarding.\nIn fact, it is rather understandable and probably key factor of success the developer put together a short experience, since it brings a good all around polished product.\n\nEven though it is categorized as shooter, I find the exploration part of the game the most notorious one.\nThe shooter aspects are not very challenging at all. They just fill up some spaces in the overall game design.\n\nLevel design and art style are both great. Music also fits in smoothly.\n\nDo play it!","December 18, 2014","true","14.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's some interesting mechanics to be found here - various elements and enemies that you come across as you hunt down those elusive collectables.\n\nThe art style is what stands out here - simple, but really quite perfect for this style of game. The art reminds me of some old drawings I used to do in the back of a classroom - explaining my extra fondness.\n\nWould loved to have had a little more length to the game. Still curious to give multiplayer a go and see how that plays - I can imagine quite well, although I hope there are some special multiplayer focused maps to really take advantage of some mechanics.\n\nDefinitely worth a pick up if you are after something that is easy to pick up for a few minutes at a time.

First off, the game is gorgeous. The game's aesthetic is what attracted me to the game in the first place. Thankfully, this twin stick adventure plays as good as it looks. Playing with all the different fluids (lava, water, magnetic liquid) and learning how they react to one another is a joy. The shooting mechanics are rock solid as well. For as much fun as the action segments were, what I most enjoyed about PJS was exploring every inch of the subterranean, alien environments. I love how surprisingly relaxing this game is too, not unlike its predecessor, PIxelJunk Eden. Even in the midst of a heated battle, there's little to no tension. It's a great game to unwind with for this reason. And I caught myself laughing after seemingly every death in the game because of my own foolishness. A rare quality in a game.\n\nPIxelJunk Shooter 2 can't come out soon enough on PC! BUY. THIS. GAME!","January 21, 2014","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The art reminds me of some old drawings I used to do in the back of a classroom - explaining my extra fondness.\n\nWould loved to have had a little more length to the game.

For all you twin stick shooter fans that are actually looking for a hardcore action packed arcade shooter, this may not be for you. This is a thinker shooter much like Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet. There is a little action which could be better and the boss fights are a lot more satisfying.\n\nThe baisc premise of this game is that you are piloting a ship while traversing a hostal environment and saving scientists from a planet being over run by very odd lookiing aliens. To do this you must manipulate the elements on the planet in order to progress further.\n\nThough I have not had a chance to check it out yet, Pixel Junk Shooter also offers a co-op mode which gives this game a little more value. It is highly recommended that this game is played with a controller. If you are still playing these type of games with a mouse and keyboard, I can only suggest that you give your thumbs up to a controller, as twin stick shooters are best enjoyed with 2 sticks!*\n\n*(for more information please see: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/all_thumbs)\n\nOverview\nGameplay: Casual Twin Stick Shooter\nControls: Solid, though I have not try this game with the keyboard and mouse. It's a twin stick by design and really should be played that way.\nSounds: Great sound track. I love that funky Police (you know "Sting") like track that kicks in with the action.\nGraphics: They are okay and design is a little sub-par. Although, physics are sweet and really make the game that much better!\nReplayability: Some, Pixel Junk Shooter does offer a co-op mode so even you cheap freinds can jump in.\nOverall: 8/10 - Ran great on my i5 - HD3000 laptop but graphic designs are what bothered me the most about this game. A lot of the sprites look like they were designed by kids straight out of elementary school but looking past that, this is a great solid thinker/shooter.\nPixel Junk Shooter is a must buy if you enjoyed Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet or need a shooter that isn't all action. I know that kind of defeats the genre's purpose but give it a try and it may change your mind too.","June 21, 2014","true","10.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Buy PixelJunk Shooter Ultimate instead, it contains this game with a graphical overhaul plus its sequel for one dollar more.)\n\nPixelJunk Shooter is a twin-stick shooter/puzzle game with some neat liquid physics. I found it very reminiscent of indie puzzle platformers, only based on a twin-stick shooter engine instead of, well, a platformer engine, with some tricky levels and fun boss fights at the end of each of the three chapters.\n\nThe only real drawbacks are that it's a bit on the short side and, when it comes to finding all of the treasures and secret areas, the game often turns into Pixel♥♥♥♥♥ Shooter, with you needing to flail your grapple around in corners, destroy all the soft rock in large levels, and try pushing your ship into all of the dead ends in order to get 100% completion. That's... not quite as entertaining as actually playing the game for progression.\n\nStill, it ends up a solid enough game to earn my recommendation.","October 21, 2015","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's part shooter, part puzzle game, with elements of gameplay that remind me of Ikaruga (without the ridiculous level of difficulty), a 2d sandbox game (for use of elements, not a customizable world), and the Zelda series.\n\nEach level is well-designed, visually entertaining, and the addition of new gameplay mechanics comes at just the right pace to keep you from getting bored.  The basic gameplay is 1) fly around, rescuing scientists with your grappling hook, shoot a few (easy) enemies before they kill you, blow away rock to find secret rooms/gems and use new ship "suits" and their powers to manipulate the elements to solve puzzles.  The boss design is cute, and challenging enough that you probably won't beat them on the first try or the second, but you won't become frustrated, either.  You life meter is very different from most shooters; instead of a couple hits killing you outright, damage (environmental and enemy) causes you to overheat, and you either need to cool off by plunging into water, or take a time out before you blow yourself up.  This was a very refreshing take on damage for a shooter, and allows one to make a couple foolish mistakes and impatient attempts without being penalized too heavily.\n\nMy favorite part of the game was the interplay of the elements in the game:  lava, water, ice, explosive gas, dirt, and a corrosive + magnetic fluid.  When lava hits water, it turns into dirt (and gets cosumed in the process), which you can use to dam up areas, or create an umbrella over yourself for safe passage, and it can also melt ice, or ignite the explosive gas!  Passing through the gass slightly overheats your ship, and is dangerous, because something else in the environment may ignite it while you're in the cloud, killing you.  Water turns to ice when it hits other ice, which may trap and kill your ship, or be ripped down with the grappling hook to clear it away, or deliver water to other areas.  Water also turns the black magnetic fluid into explosive gas.  The magnetic fluid is drawn to your ship, so don't fly to closely over it, as it will rise up to meet you, and quickly causes damage!  It can also be attracted to other magnets, which are usually controlled by a remote switch, playing very similarly to the water dungeons in Zelda.\n\nTo further interact with these elements, there are several suits your ship can wear, which are accessible via landing strips in the appropriate levels.  There's a water suit, which swaps your ship's missle launcher for a water hose (don't forget to shoot above yourself and let it rain down on you if you're overheating!), and uniquely, has a grappling hook which can grab and rip off chunks of ice, since you no longer have a weapon that can blast anything away.  The magma suit operates similarly, exchanging your missles for a lava hose, but don't assume you're fireproof!  The inverter suit doesn't change your weapons at all, but switches the gameplay mechanics so that water "overheats" you, and lava "cools" and heals you, allowing passageway through areas you couldn't previously reach, as well as added dangers.  The magnetic repeller suit keeps your missles, but instead of attacting the magnetic/corrosive fluid, you repel it, which can be used to safely traverse pools of it, as well as deflect it away into enemies, or to fill containers that act as switches.\n\nAll in all, I'm VERY satisfied with this game, especially for the $1 or whatever it cost in the bundle deal (PixelJunk's tower defense game is HORRIBLE, don't even install it!).  It's simple enough for early teenagers to play, and fun/creative enough for adults as well.  It's a game I'm proud to have in my library to support the developers, and was entertaining all the way through.  I'd say this game is worth $4.99 on its own, and anything less than that is a steal.","June 21, 2015","true","11.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Nothing too challenging--you'll likely get through it if you're okay with the drifty controls and relaxed pace of it. The levels are fixed patterns, so eventually, you'll learn the foe spawns, boss fights, etc. to get through. There's some challenge getting 100% on all the collectibles and rescues, but they're not necessary to have a good time.","December 3, 2015","true","9.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The whole level unlock system comes off as a boring way to lengthen the game)\n\nOverall:\nPretty fun, get it on a good sale!","April 23","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was not difficult or challenging, but it was still fun.\nI didn't buy it at full price. It came in a bundle for cheap. At the price I got it at, it was well worth it.\n\nThe good:\n\nThe first boss battle was great. The second one was fun.\n\nFun water physics.\n\nThe bad: (Just because this list is long doesn't mean I didn't like the game. It was certainly fun.)\n\nAuto aim. The only thing this does is make me shoot the guys I'm supposed to be rescuing or make me grab 45 degrees to the right to grab a thing that kills me instead of grabbing what I was aiming at.\n\nThe hidden gems in the ice. You have to melt almost everything just to get them because there is no indicator where they are. This is tedious.\n\nI found all the hidden guys with flags and it gave me the achievement for finding all secret areas, but I hadn't found all of the secret areas that had gems in it at that time.\n\nThe 11:11 achievement. I'm not waiting around for some arbitrary time of day for an achievement.\n\nThe platnium achievement. Just have it given the instant you get all other achievements. Why require restarting the game for this to activate?\n\nI had to look up in the controls to find out about spinning because there is nothing that I remember of that tells you about it. This meant that when I was in water mode and had to dig with spinning, I wasted a lot of time trying to figure it out due to this lack of information.\n\nThe final boss wasn't as fun as the first two.","May 27","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
