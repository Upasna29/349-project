Seriously."  ~Oscar Wilde\n\nThe Story: It's the early 1900s, and "the Master Painter" has returned to his seemingly abandoned home to finish painting his magnum opus. Take control of the masterpainter, and follow him on his journey as he furiously masterpaints all over his house. Watch as he masterpaints and coats the walls in his creative juices. Assemble sentimental objects to help aid in the masterpainter's masterpainting. Collect old notes from his wife about how his chronic masterpainting has ruined their marriage. Bear witness to the adverse effects that a masterpainting addiction has on your mental health. Can you help cure the masterpainter of his masterpainting addiction, or will he shoot his biggest, most creative load of all time?\n\nWhat I Thought: Layers of Fear tells a cliche story, but it tells it very well. To its credit, it doesn't seem to be trying to reinvent the wheel when it comes to story telling. What it does do, and it does this very well, is create an amazingly terrifying atmosphere that is guaranteed to unnerve even the most seasoned horror game fans.\n\nThe setting is nothing new, but the concept is: It's your stereotypical haunted house simulator with a literally artistic twist. The rooms you progress through are randomly generated. This helps keep the game fresh if you're one of those completionist types who needs to replay games to find all the collectibles. Beyond that it's mostly just a gimmick, but a welcome one at that. The house is beautifully crafted and the atmosphere is very thick. The sound design is extremely well done, and It's easy to get lost (figuratively and literally) in the world of the Master Painter.\n\nSpeaking of the Master Painter, the guy is a total scumbag. What we learn of him doesn't  paint  a pretty picture. He's an abusive, neglectful alcoholic who, as metioned earlier, does nothing but masterpaint all day. It's impossible to identify with him in any way, unless the player has an affinity for art. The voice acting feels off... that's not to say it's bad, it's just that it doesn't seem to fit the character that the developers are presenting to us. All in all, the protagonist is interesting, but he's mostly just a flanderized "tortured artist" type of guy.\n\nI would definitely recommend this game to horror fans. It's a must play. I'm hesitant to recommend it to adventure enthusiasts, as the story is shaping up to be very cliche and predictable, but you should give it a try if you're at all interested. It's definitely something people should experience.\n\nNow if you'll all excuse me, I'm going to go browse ArtHub and masterpaint.","December 19, 2015","true","2.0"," 216 of 238 people (91%) found this review helpful 212 people found this review funny","91","216","238","212","3"

I refuse to buy games in early access anymore, so I just add them to my wish lish and wait for them to be "finished".\n\nI am posting this review after I played and beat the game.\n\nLayers of fear is kind of an interactive story, puzzle, survival horror kind of game. You play as an artist returning home to work on his opus magnum.\n\nAt what first appears to be a basic jaunt around his home, quickly turns into a psychological horror, the house appears to be (possibly) haunted as the layouts change, you are confronted by visions of your dead wife and other various paranormal-esc situations.\n\nAlong the way, you'll collect notes and other memorabilia within the house that offers quick glimpses into the painter's past life, his family and even the state of his mental health.\n\nThe game isn't as "scary" as other games of this nature may be and in fact, you are put in several situations in which you can avoid confrontation entirely if so desired. As far as I am aware, there isn't really a way to die in the traditional sense, which is nice, because the game is set up in a way that you won't have to restart entire chapters of a mistake you may have made.\n\nThe writing for the story is farily good, I'd say much better then games such as Penumbra. It's a fairly unqiue and engaging story that made me want to continue playing just to find out a little bit more.\n\nThe puzzles are (generally) not too hard and there was very few moments I was actually stuck. Unfortunately the game doesn't help you in any real sense, besides some hints scattered about the game and as a result some of the more obscure puzzles can leave players scratching their head.\n\nWhile I did enjoy the time I spent with the game, there are issues with it that I feel inclined to inform people of.\n\nFor starters, when you first start playing the game, it's fun and fascinating to explore the artist's big, beautiful house. The problem is that very early in the game, the exploration aspect of the game is all but removed, Instead the game becomes somewhat of an "on-rails" adventure game, instead of walking freely through the house, instead you'll be traversing hallways and single rooms. 9 out of 10 times, as you enter one room, the door will close and lock behind you, denying any sort of back tracking in the game.\n\nThis can become an issue, because the game feels as if it were meant to be explored and it was just a concept that was throw to the side. On occasion you may be given the opportunity to travel off the beaten path, but it is almost always just for a moment and it usually results in a dead end or locked door. The missing exploration concept bothers me, because I have always loved horror books, games and movies that involved big, old, beautiful mansions.\n\nAnother problem that I had with the game is it never really changes scenery too much. A large majority of the game just looks the same. Expect to see a lot of dark, dingy rooms, broken walls and floors and broken furniture. Also expect to see the same art, furniture and random junk over and over and over again. This becomes an even bigger issue when the game starts to begin recycling rooms.\n\nFinally, the last problem I had with the game was the story. Remember earlier when I said they had a good story? They do, the problem stems from the fact that there's a lot of information presented for players to process and it's never really tied together or explained in any real sort of meaningful way. While I enjoyed the game while I played it, after I beat it, I felt very dissatisfied because I really didn't learn all that much and the game doesn't really make a good attempt at helping you understand.\n\nI have questions, no one appears to have answers and frankly, I am no really into the entire "fan theory community" in which the developers of a game simply don't inform or release information to players, instead they just wait to see if someone gets it "right". For me, it just seems like a really lazy form of writing and I tend to get high aggravated with it.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I love reading long books, I like guessing at the story, or the plots or even coming up with theories as I enjoy whatever book/movie/game I am playing. But I expect the writers to eventually tie down and explain what is going on in a clear, concise and satisfying way.\n\nIf you like games of this nature, if you have enjoyed games like 'A Machine for Pigs' and 'Penumbra', you'll enjoy this game a lot. If you like psychological horror, you'll appreciate this game. I can without hesitation recommend this game to horror fans, even given the rough spots of the game.","May 1","true","5.6"," 142 of 149 people (95%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","95","142","149","5","2"

Rain is falling heavily outside, with occasional bursts of thunder crackling behind you. The entire game is influenced by art and décor from previous centuries, particularly the architecture and design of the 19th century, and the visuals are very well tied together with this theme.\nWhat also worth mentioning is the incredibly alluring and chilling soundtrack during the gameplay, that gives you the emotions the situation pulls you in.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sB_6mk-XTw\n\nI’d recommend the game to anyone who enjoys horror games as a genre, particularly if you don’t mind games where you can’t defend yourself and it’s all about you, the antagonist, and the spooky atmosphere.\nDespite the game 'still' being in Early Access, what IS available to play is deeply engaging, if in need of a little polish here and there.\nThe game relies heavily on its ability to set you on edge, so if you’re the type with nerves of steel you likely won’t get too much out of it. To horror fans, however? I wholeheartedly recommend Layers of Fear to you!\n\n\n\n9/10","November 21, 2015","true","17.4"," 106 of 108 people (98%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","98","106","108","4","4"

The story takes you on a tour through the mind of a madman. As you progress, you find clues that give you details about life of the character before he went crazy. I actually had chills during certain areas of the game. The environment is constantly changing around you, and you never know what is waiting for you at the next turn.\n\nI would definitely suggest picking this game up while it is in EA (Early Access). I was left hanging because the game is unfinished. The cool thing about being a part of this game while it is in EA is that the game is constantly changing.

It was Aristotle who first noted that those who have been eminent in philosophy, politics, poetry, and the arts generally have tendencies toward melancholia or hysteria which is somewhat supported by modern day research. It is an idea that is deeply embedded in our modern day culture where the artist is seen to excel in his or her field but is often heavily tormented by inner demons where the torment is an equal part of the creative gift.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=628239048\nIt is no wonder then that writers of fiction, plays and poetry have been using the trope of the tortured genius as a framing device for as far back as history itself has been recorded with Shakespeare giving life to arguably one of literature's most recognizable tortured geniuses, Prince Hamlet of Denmark in his famous tragedy of the same name - Hamlet. That being said Layers of Fear's main troubled protagonist is no Hamlet as Layers of Fear opts to revel in the horror of mental illness rather than the tragedy of it as our warped leading man, a famed Victorian painter, is thrust into a never ending nightmare of a mind slowly unraveling thanks to the demands of a cruel mistress - the creative process - as he sets about creating his magnum opus after a series of critical failures and domestic tragedies befall him.\n\nSadly Layers of Fear opts to travel the route of Carnival House of Horrors rather than delve deeply into the psychology of a man slowly loosing his mind. It soon becomes evident that the Victorian house the game is set in, with its ever increasing labyrinth of morphing corridors and architecture is the not-so-subtle metaphor that is our poor tortured souls mind. When home sweet home isn't taking on the role of our fractured painters mind it also doubles up as your typical haunted house where a series of unspeakable horrors have recently taken place. While I enjoyed the games constant skewering of architectural perspective - the creators of Layers of Fear have certainly filled it with enough moments of awe particularly a scene where the player has to locate a ringing phone in a study that soon evolves into a high rise of never ending bookshelves, doors and paintings that sees you teetering on the edge in order to reach the phone - when it comes to playing out the games haunted house scenario,  Layers of Fear is, unfortunately, severely lacking in any form of tension and seems to have nothing original to say about the topic.\n\nInstead the creators of Levels of Fear have opted to follow the cliched route of doors suddenly slamming shut, inanimate obects suddenly sprouting to life or animals (rats in this case) startling the player as they dash out in front of you. None of it is even remotely scary if you happen to be a person weened on this kind of horror thanks to countless terrible horror films that have employed this mechanic to instill fear into their audiences. There is even a point where the walls and roof of the home start to bleed a black gooey substance calling into effect the horrors of Amityville.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=628238718\nNot once during my entire playthrough did I jump once as the jump scares the game employs to introduce "horror" are so telegraphed that they barely register on the fear factor scale. Also with no real direct threat facing our main protagonist you never really feel like you are in any kind of danger despite some rather ominous looking shifts in dimension the house employs to try and ratchet up the tension as you explore the various rooms of the home to piece together the events that occurred in the house. There is also not much to do in Layers of Fear except keep walking forward and occasionally interacting with an object, letter or newspaper clipping that is used to fill in the backstory. Sadly most of you will guess the direction the story is headed within the first five minutes of gameplay. Thankfully Layers of Fear doesn't go for more exposition than is needed to reach its conclusion and should take most gamer's roughly about 3 hours to complete from beginning to end.\n\nLayers of Fear also attempts to introduce some puzzle elements at six key locations in the house that will require solving in order to retrieve an item that will help you complete the painting you have started but also act as items that drive the story forward. They are not particularly challenging with the solution often to simply just walk around the room activating whatever the cursor highlights until the item becomes visible. Graphically Layers of Fear looks incredible with some very highly detailed models and environments. When I saw that the game was made using Unity I was even more surprised given that a lot of indie developers use it with minimal effect to churn out utter rubbish. I played the game on a laptop using a 680M GPU and the game ran near flawlessly at 60FPS on High Detail for the most part (the only place I noticed severe drops in frames was when you find yourself submerged under water towards the end of the game).\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=627135390\nLayers of Fear is an interesting experiment. Using the profession of a painter with his art being the very thing that causes his world to collapse from the inside out is one half entertaining and visually striking and the other half dreary and dull as dirty dishwater. As a pure horror title though - Layers of Fear is unfortunately lacking in what every single horror title needs the most - a pulse. I would still definitely recommend playing through it once since you can complete it in an afternoon and some of the visual tricks the game employs to move the story along are certainly creative and worth experiencing but I wouldn't pay full price for it.

Is it my fault then, imperfect as I am, that I cannot give it life; that it must exist on an ideal plane, mocked as I am by its twisted, deranged lessers? But this tragedy, this pain, this torture... this tribulation has opened my eyes – so wide that they well with bloody tears; strained and blurred, still I see it clear as day. I've used the wrong tools, the wrong canvas. My paints I'll replace with blood; my canvas with flesh.\n\nThis... this I am owed.\n\nImmortality will elude me no longer.\n\nI'm not going to beat around the bush ladies and gentlemen – THIS, this is currently the best horror game of 2015, the horror game to beat – and Early Access only means it will (hopefully, ideally) get better. It's moody, atmospheric, and subtly terrifying before abruptly cranking the spooky dial to 11. It's graphically and audibly on par with the much-lauded PT. It is, much like an onion, layered.\n\nIt's spectacular.\n\nYou are an artist hit hard by tragedies, drowning your sorrows in booze. Your art, a reflection of your crippled, troubled soul becomes so twisted, dark, and deranged that even your friends are rejecting your macabre pieces. As you explore your beautifully furnished, turn-of-the-19th-century home you'll find newspaper clips and scattered mementos that fill in the narrative. And you'd be remiss to shrug this title off as “just another walking simulator,” though it initially smacks of that. Very little happens at first as you explore; the gameplay primarily consists of opening, inspecting, collecting, etc.\n\nIf you're anything like me you'll just gawk your way through each room. Layers of Fear is as beautiful and nuanced as the Renaissance and Baroque period paintings hanging in the artist's home – limited asset recycling, great lighting, varied colors... it's like you're playing a still life painting.\n\nAnd the sound is great. As your player character wobbles from room to room you hear the creaking of the floorboard, the crashing of glass, the wailing of women, and more sinister orchestrations. Some moments are accented with shrill “horror” chords, and others leave you to silently contemplate what you've just seen. It's masterfully executed and should be commended, perhaps moreso than the graphical power. It really, truly is immersive.\n\n\nMost importantly it is SCARY. I started off ♥♥♥♥♥ure, walking through every room, picking up every item, confidently flinging doors wide open with nary a glance over my shoulder. But slowly the pieces fall together and you'll start seeing things. Was that graffiti always on the wall? And that portrait? Surely the subject's face wasn't always so... pained? And I was sure I left that door wide open. Like the very artist you play you'll begin to watch the world melt around you, unsure of your own mental health. What's real and what isn't? What horrors befell this man (who looks eerily like Sir Anthony Hopkins), and what horrors has he committed in the pursuit of artistic perfection?\n\nIt starts out atmospherically heavy, drawing you into a false sense of security. And the moment you put your down guard things seem to scurry around you. It uses a few jumpscares, yes, but usually to cut the tension of an excruciatingly long buildup. It's jumpscares done right - at the behest of the atmosphere.\n\nIs Layers of Fear a worthy investment? I think so. The developers have stated it's 75% completed (it certainly looks and plays the part). And they're adamant about listening to the community for suggestions, which is a bit of a double edged sword. But based on what they've presented I have no doubt that this project is in skilled, loving hands... the hands of a sculptor, one might say, who can see the subject in the stone even before setting to work.\n\nI'm thoroughly impressed, as this year so far has been kind of lackluster with the horror releases. I believe, sincerely, that Layers of Fear broke the horror drought we've suffered for so long.\n\nAnd with waters rising who knows what will float up from the depths?\n\nEdit: And for what it's worth this game has the BEST, most frustrated, most ominous knocking I've heard in a game since Eternal Darkness. It is persistent.","August 27, 2015","true","3.4"," 146 of 183 people (80%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","80","146","183","9","12"

Guys I am afraid to turn around, I hear voices and tonight I leave the radio and the lights on when I go to sleep!\n\nThis game is pure HORROR! In a good way. The team did a very good job finishing that game. Everyone who got this when it was still Early Access has to admit that this is one of the best Early Access games here on steam.\n\nThe game offers a variety of jump scares and exploring the house. The storytelling is quite interesting and reminds me me of F.E.A.R. where the story was told through all the messages and phone calls. Here you´ll find letters, notes that unfold the story. Especially the slow pace of this game is what it makes so damn scary. You wander through the corridors and rooms of that house and never know what happens and when it happens.\n\nFor me each round (When I get back to the easle)  it is like a "Tunnel of Horror" I love how the developers put every cliche of horror into the game - from the ball that rolls down the stairs, the child in the bathtub the Poltergeist scene this game definitely scared the frog outta me.\n\nGraphics and sound a superb. To be honest I never played a better horror game. Daylight was scary but technically it was a mess. Outlast was scary especially for me I loved it because of the asylum setting. I don´t name all the other horror games like Doom3 , The Suffering Ties that Bind, and F.E.A.R. Controls of how to open doors, chests and use objects like the phonograph are a bit strange but the longer you play the better it gets.\n\nIf you like horror shooters this game could bore you quickly because there is no shooting, no hiding it´s just exploring a haunted mansion with its cursed rooms and a bonkers artist whose story you have to unravel.\n\nIf you like games like Slenderman, SCP-087 this is the perfect game for you. If you´re not sure to buy or not I only can recommend it. Everyone likes ghost trains in the amusement park right? So go ahead and board thisd 4 to 5 hours ghost train!","February 16","true","11.5"," 88 of 101 people (87%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","87","88","101","7","7"

You won't be able to play through the whole game in the current state. Don't let it scare you off. Why? You'll find out in this review.\n\n▐▐░░▒▒▓▓ Review ▓▓▒▒░░▐▐\n\nIn Layers of Fear everything revolves around a famous painter. Without any sightable goal he explores his mansion, but step by step the madness seizes the painter and everything around him changes into nightmarish scenes. Something seems to be following his steps and yet it's not certain if it will harm him and tries to lead him into the deep insanity ... might it be the madness itself?\n\nStorytelling and gameplay reminds a lot about Amnesia: A machine for pigs. Neither an inventory nor difficult puzzles will put obstacles in your way. You might just lean back and enjoy the deep atmosphere of the game while discovering the huge mansion. But nothing is like it seems. Rooms change within an eyeblink and some events even force you to break the rule #1 in horror games: to not look behind you. With the feeling that every minute something might happen you wouldn't dare to look back, would you?\nNevertheless, this game will not leave you stumble aimless in the dark. On your exploration you will find news articles and letters which will reveal the reason behind the madness of the painter.\n\nThe graphics are well made and emphasize the deep atmosphere with high-definition textures and a stunning ambient illumination. Sounds and music give the atmosphere the final touch and suck you deep into the mad mind of that man with no name.\n\nEven the controls have the same mechanic like in Amnesia and Penumbra. With the left mousebutton hold and the movement of your mouse you can open and close doors, chests and everything else that might reveale more about the whole story. Easy to get into it you will enjoy the storytelling even more.\n\n▐▐░░▒▒▓▓ To cut the long story short ▓▓▒▒░░▐▐\n\nNot every horror game creates an atmosphere that keeps me playing forward. Yet still unfinished and not possible to play through the whole story it let me wait impatient to know about more. If you like Amnesia and Penumbra, you will like this piece of good work too. Don't have expectations for a game filled with challenging puzzles; you will be disappointed. For now the entrance to the chamber of horros might cost you 10$ but with the hope that the developer will continue on the story it is worth every single penny.\n\nDarken your room, put your headphones on and enjoy the nightmarish trip through the mind of a mad man.\n\n▐▐░░▒▒▓▓ Scoring ▓▓▒▒░░▐▐\n\nGameplay: 8.0/10.0\nGraphics: 9.0/10.0\nControls: 10.0/10.0 (Schematics of Amnesia/Penumbra)\nSounds: 10.0/10.0\nGame length: In the current state 2 hours; finished game: N/A\nRecommendable: Horror enthusiasts and fans from Amnesia / Penumbra will love this.\n\nAll in all: 9.0/10.0","September 19, 2015","true","2.2"," 58 of 62 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","58","62","0","6"

And in Layers of Fear, the world you're taken to is full of darkness and insanity that lingers in the walls and bleeds through the carpet, beckoning you onwards throughout the game to taste its sweet horror.\n\nMany of the comments point out how scary this game is. Personally, I agree it is scary but not like Amnesia scary (which on my scale is utterly terrifying). This game has a constant undertone of darkness and a nightmarish quality that bares its teeth all throughout the game, with moments of heightened terror which truly make the experience worthwhile while not being too terribly scary to be unable to play through it.\n\nThe voiceover, trinkets, and pieces of correspondence that you discover throughout the game provide a very well-rounded way of understanding the madness that struck the artist and how his colleagues around him reacted. The soundtrack is superb, and at one point I had to stop momentarily to enjoy the piece that played over a particular part of the game.\n\nOverall, Layers of Fear overflows with beauty and tragedy, and I'm glad to have been able to experience this piece of art. To the developers: You're one of the good ones. Thank you for your ongoing contribution to indie games.","October 4, 2015","true","2.0"," 53 of 58 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","53","58","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LadyTenjoin/recommended/391720/","LadyTenjoin","LadyTenjoin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LadyTenjoin/","983 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nLayers of Fear is a horror adventure game that delves into the twisted mind of a troubled painter and his descent to madness. One thing I’ve notice the game does right is the pacing of the story. It starts of slow, depicting an earlier and happier life of the protagonist, introducing key objects and areas that will become central to the story later on. Gradually, the terror is introduced, first as harmless dissolving paintings, then to the ghastly apparition of his supposedly dearly departed wife.\n\nIt’s great to see an early access horror game actually terrify me because I absolutely love the disturbing atmosphere and the tension I’ve felt traversing through the shifting and looping corridors of this mad painter’s house. The game is riddled with jumpscares, I’ll give you that one and I grew numb to them by the 3rd time but the game doesn’t solely rely on jumpscares to scare you. It incorporates sounds as a way to rattle you. Whether it is the haunting laughter of a distant woman or the mocking giggles of children, to the peaceful pieces of classical music, these sounds alerts the player and puts them on edge.\n\nThere are barely any puzzles so this first person narrative is all you have but it isn’t exactly a walking simulator. There are notes to collect, objects to find that trigger memories and rooms that paint a story of the painter’s history.  I can’t say there’s much to explore since the game does lead you to where you need to go anyways so it is pretty much a linear game but it is enjoyable walking through the hallways of the painter’s home and see what has change since it does loop around (similar to PT, if you've played it).\n\nUnfortunately, there are some optimization problems even though the graphics are pretty to look at (slows down in some parts i.e. the kitchen area) but nothing a few patches can’t solve. The early access only show about half of the game (from what I can tell) and I managed to complete it in an hour and half so I can’t imagine the full game will be too long. Then again, I can’t be certain since it’s not complete yet. I know some people aren’t keen on buying into an Early Access game but I bought it at a discount and I don’t regret my purchase.\n\nTL:DR\n\nPros:\n-	Great, eerie atmosphere\n-	Excellent pacing of the story\n-	Good sounds and music\n-	Pretty graphics\n\nCons:\n-	Not complete yet since it is still in Early Access\n-	Optimization problems\n-	Jumpscares (I didn’t like them…)\n-	The slow pacing at the beginning might turn off some people\n-  Linear\n\nThanks for reading and when you have the time, here’s my video of me fooling around in Layers of Fear. A word of caution, the more I talked, the more panicked I was feeling XD\n\nLayers of Fear Video","August 31, 2015","true","3.5"," 49 of 56 people (88%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","88","49","56","4","2"

Whilst the main story is fairly linear, you do get chances to break off the main path to explore the dark and spooky manor in which the game takes place in. You will be able to find family heirlooms which contains snippets of extra plot for you to delve deeper into this ghostly plot. The exploration portion of Layers of Fear reminded me a lot of Outlast – the way you explore rooms and navigate around the world has many similarities. There isn’t a combat system in Layers of Fear, again like Outlast, but this is because you won’t really run into any combat facing scenarios. You will come up against your foes, but these will be part of scripted events which you cannot escape or bypass from.\n\nAs you would expect from any Adventure game, the puzzles are your standard “horror style”, that usually involve the use of candles, dead babies and dolls, blood written on walls to reveal codes for lock doors and many more. I really enjoyed working out the resolution to all of the puzzles throughout, and was pleasantly surprised with myself when I did it all unaided without a walkthrough.  Some of the puzzles were sadly marred with technical problems, which resulted in me needing to load from a previous check point, because simple things like objects that you need to move, suddenly stop being able to be moved. These small technical issues grew a little tiresome towards the latter chapters as game’s checkpoint system is not the best to say the least.\n\nThe graphics in Layers of Fear look spectacular – the game is built on the Unity 3D engine so the highly details character models and locations were brought to life. The scares use of lighting is used perfectly as it leads you down an even darker path throughout the game.  The manor you are exploring is filled with creepy art work on the walls, which are well worth the time just to check out.\n\nThe game took me just over four hours to complete, I managed this in on sitting which is something to be noted as I often find adventure games like this to be slow paced and I usually need to break it up into multiple sessions. The game’s pacing right from the start is slow, but you are able to take the game at your own speed. If you want to spend an extra fifteen minutes exploring the house, go right ahead, it’s not going to deter you the path, however if you choose not to, you won’t be missing key plot points by skipping over the extra lore items that can be found.\n\nLayers of Fear does offer alternative endings; these are done by playing the game in certain ways, for instance not picking up the hidden secrets throughout a play through will unlock a special ending; this encourages players to do more than one run and will reward them rightly so at the end.\n\nI would have to say Layers of Fear has been a brilliant adventure game that hit all the sweet spots for any horror story. The game is owned by over 100K players, so it has been accepted by the wider audience, and rightly so. It’s hard to find fault with many aspects of this game, and the price tag is fairly targeted for a game with plenty of replay value.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

But color me surprised - this game is nothing but top notch highy quality.  Put on some headphones and scare the crap out of yourself.  Are there jump scares?  Yes but the game does not rely on them to scare you.  Even without the jump scares it would be terrifying.  Layers of Fear gives a wink and a smile to games like Silent Hill and more recently P.T. which is never a bad thing considering how good they are.  Graphics are excellcent - full of great special effects, trippy melting pictures, and shifting rooms.  Sound design and music is very well done too.  The gameplay is basically walking through a very well designed haunted house with a story unraveling while solving some minor puzzles.  I can't wait for more content.

This. Is. Scary.\nIt truly is, and I thoroughly enjoying my time in game. This is beautifully executed, and relies much less on jumpscares than many other games. There are some, and they are pretty decent, but what takes the cake is the feeling of insanity holding your character firmly in its grip.\nthe house is like some kind of hell, confusing, scary, full of secrets and hidden things. Sometimes it's like some kind of bad trip. Walk into a room. Nothing in there. Turn around, the door is gone.\nThere are some insanely (literally) cool ideas here... some scenes for example related to a still-life of fruit, or a piano in a basement. You will see, if you keep going.\n\nAlso, the game is quite unpredictable. Sometimes you are absolutely positive there'll be some kind of a cliché jumpscare hitting you.And it doesn't. But then, when you don't expect it, something totally crazy will happen.\n\nAlso, slowly but surely, through newspapers, monologues, things you find, you get an idea that there is a totally HORRIBLE backstory to the character, his family and his house. Wait until you start unlocking the secrets related to your current painting.\n\nEven though there is no direct reference, I find myself thinking of Lovecraft-style horror, not only because of the old school vibe of the house, but because the game sometimes only HINTS at terrible things, instead of showing them to the tiniest detail. The atmosphere creeps you out, makes you imagine what is behind all this, even though you haven't even seen a lot yet.\n\nThe game is not at all open world in any sense of the world. It's very much on rails, dictating where you go, and there isn't a ton of interaction with items, no inventory etc. (mostly, you pick up keys or items for your painting)\nIt's weird, it's mysterious, it's nutty, sometimes yucky, it's scary, shocking, yet very beautiful.\nBig gratz to the developers who really came up with some killer ideas, and created a VERY scary, immersive and atmospheric game. Up for a scare? Something that's not about cheap jumpscares and more about getting an idea of how someone goes insane, with all the weirdness and unpredictable, irrational stuff involved? Get. This. Game.\n\nIf you play it with headphones (recommended by the devs) and lights off...don't say I didn't warn you.\n9/10, even in this early state","October 31, 2015","true","1.8"," 37 of 42 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","37","42","2","0"

I'm coming back to it nightly and throwing in the next session. I'm writing this because I keep seeing very annoying >greentext reviews and it's sh***y so, on with the review.\n\nHorror games have been having a lot of trouble, as of late. They are usually very gimmicky and often times extremely predictable. Very little do we see actual psychological horror done correctly anymore. The last two horror games I have loved have been Outlast: Whistleblower and Amnesia: The Dark Descent. There's a bit of a time gap there. And before that, it was Silent Hill 2 so we've been lacking in good horror games. I miss the Oh, sh*t moments of games like Condemned: Criminal Origins when paths were being blocked behind you and mannequins had replaced that open space to loosen you up with unease before a hobo attacked you. Sound silly? Well, it is until you're playing it. But it hadn't much been tried before that and it was delivered well. The originality of it payed off.\n\nNow, where does Layers of Fear come in? Psychological Horror brought back to form. Think back to the Silent Hill series. Yes, many were terrible but I still remember the moment when I realized, "This f**king staircase is infinite..." and turned around. This game does it constantly; nearly to the point of being a gimmick. It's actually really quite unsettling. You start realizing that once that door closes behind you, you've nowhere to go but forward. The atmosphere is perfect and it's visually a treat to play. A few mechanical problems with the loading sometimes but nothing that takes away from the game. The way that the story is delivered is something of a treat as well. It hands you just enough in voice acting for you to get it but if you really want the dark story behind you game, you will read read read and it's very very good stuff.\n\nNow, there are some issues with this game. The main one that gets to me, even if I know that there's no real solution unless they wanted to lose some aspects of this work; the sense of danger. They bring it to you and hand it to you on a silver platter but even the most minute thought of what the games mechanics are shatters the emotion. I'm claustrophobic and this game really exploited that at one point. Shadows were closing in around me, forcing me to, if I wanted my sanity, go toward this still life painting of fruit which, for *ehem* reasons was actually very terrifying, but yet, the next set of rooms were supposed to make you look over your shoulder but yet, you knew that because of the nature of this game, there's no health bar or real sprint feature. It isn't going to Amnesia you and force you to hide in a closet. It plays with phobias, not fight or flight. Now, I said this is a bad thing but really only for people who aren't readily affected by that kind of scare. If you are totally immersed and you are okay with letting your imagination run wild with this game, you will be more than serviced by this game. You'll need to take breathers as I have had to.\n\nSecond gripe, the voice acting is serviceable. It's pretty okay but one listen to the opening monologue will turn you off a little. It does get better but sometimes, you just have to really read the subtitles and think of the image instead of the delivery. Small gripe, though.\n\nOne last thing, when this game isn't messing with your inner fears, it's jump scaring you. I hate jump scares. I think they're cheap....but this game doesn't make me hate them. It builds tension and really forces you into the world, like it or not. I'll forgive it.\n\nDo I recommend this game? Absolutely. But only if you have an open mind to what Psychological horror is in gaming. Is it survival horror by any means? No, not really. Does it make you feel like running, yes, at times, but is there anything behind you? Odds are, no. But it'll still gnaw at you and make you hate that you want to look.\n\n\nAlso, d*mn, the artist for this game was amazing.","January 7","true","3.9"," 32 of 34 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","32","34","0","1"

AT BOTTOM]\n\nLayers Of Fear is a game quite unlike any other. To add a bit of backstory, I purchased the game in Early Access back in October 2015 after being intrigued by the original idea and was instantly blown away by the amount of polish there was in an unreleased game. Even in its unfinished state, Layers Of Fear had gorgeous graphics, a well-designed story and campaign, and even a fun event for Halloween (which i accidentally got stuck in.. but besides the point). As time went on, updates changed the game and added new rooms to gameplay, which made the game replayable with every update because there was always new stuff to find.\n\nAfter being so thoroughly impressed with the Early Access version, I was ecstatic when the final product came out. I restarted the game from the beginning and found myself enjoying it just as much as I had the first time around. In Layers Of Fear, you play as a painter who buries himself away in his house, going mad as he desperately tries to finish his final masterpiece. Without spoiling too much, the game has extremely sad undertones and tells a very tragic story, should you choose to listen. However, many players won't have the gut to scavenge for story items due to how terrifying and fast paced the game is. Although Layers Of Fear can be described as a "walking simulator," it's definitely anything but dull and boring. Most of the game revolves around the mechanic of things changing behind your back while you're not looking. The entire experience is played out without a single loading screen, and this entire idea is pulled off extremely well. That being said, if you find it difficult to maneuver the world and control the camera angles in 3D games, this one may simply not be for you. Many of the scares require you to look at a certain place at a certain time, which is quite easy to do if you're used to video games, but if you aren't so good with 3D, the full effect of the game may be lost on you.\n\nNow let's talk about the scares themselves -  you can't have a good horror game without it being scary, right? Now let me say just one thing: this game is absolutely terrifying. If it isn't the scariest game I've ever played, then it's still in my top 3, no questions asked. The gorgeous graphics and flawless sound design create a gripping atmosphere at all times, and there was never a moment in the entire campaign where I wasn't on the edge of my seat, waiting to see what was going to happen next. The best thing this game has going for it is that it's original. While games like Outlast (2013) had you running away from horrific beasts in gruesome locations, Layers Of Fear's horror is very different. Some may say that Layers is filled with cheap jumpscares, but it really isn't. While the jumps are frequent, it's really the psychedelic aspect that brought out the fear in me. It's extremely difficult to explain how the scares work in this game, but even the trailers don't do it justice. This game will have you spinning in circles and watching the entire room change with every rotation. It's no joke. The jumpscares, along with the psychedelic elements and the changing rooms behind every door, will have you trembling each time you open a door at night for weeks. Not to mention that the game generally moves at a brisk pace, with a kind of BOOM scare, move to next room, BOOM another scare, etc etc, which makes it all the more terrifying each time you run away from something right into something else. I wouldn't watch too many videos on this game before playing it to get a feel for what I'm saying though, because when you see all the scares a room has to offer before you enter it, they can be a little less exciting.\n\nUnfortunately, there were a few moments in the game where doing something can become ever so slightly tedious or repetitive (THE PART WITH THE CHECKERBOARD NEAR THE END OH MY GOD), which pulls you out of the moment. In a game that's very atmosphere-centric, this can be a problem, if not only a minor one. It's also worth mentioning that the game features quite a few cleverly designed puzzles that feel challenging, but never unfair. One thing I didn't like about the update to the final game was that it added female narrative along with the player's own thoughts, which made it seem less introspective and personal. The fact that there was only one actual character with a voice actor in the game made it feel quite lonely and added to the experience. Although this is only an opinion, I feel it was important to add for the sake of being thorough.\n\nTL;DR/OVERVIEWOveral Score: 9/10\nAll in all, Layers Of Fear is a horror game I know I won't soon forget. With a completely original concept (something the horror genre overall has been lacking lately), unique scare tactics, clever puzzles and a fantastic atmosphere, Bloober Team has definitely hit the nail on the head with this one. The game is also highly replayable, as there are hundreds of cabinets to open and tons of things to find, as well as rooms that you can't visit by playing through the game only once.\n\n+ Unique Concept\n+ Great Atmosphere\n+ Original Scares\n+ Fast-Paced\n+ No Loading Screens // Very Fluid\n+ Emotional Story\n+ Replay Value\n+ Looks Fantastic\n?

A 3 hour victorian themed take on 'what if P.T. were a full game.'

Keys clanking onto metal, you hear sounds of a door opening, you are brought to attention from the pitch black screen to a scene of a mansion. You are now in control of the main character, whom you know absolutely nothing about until you explore the depths of the mansion, rummaging through every single drawer and cabinet looking for notes scattered about to give you an inkling of an idea of who the main character may be.\n\nEarly on you find out that the character is an artist, or at least was an artist sometime in the 19th century. You have the freedom to explore the mansion and it's room which are heavily Victorian in nature. A creepy piano piece plays in the background, that perfectly captures the mood of the set piece. You're alone in a giant mansion during a thunderstorm, the place feels eerily perfect, not a speck of dust can be found. You come across an easel covered by cloth. As you slowly reveal the unfinished painting, the room subtly changes. A message is sprawled on the exit that wasn't there before, 'GET IT RIGHT THIS TIME'. You go through the door, and suddenly the mansion has transformed itself. A mist of fog rises from the floor, doors lock behind you never to reopen again. The ambient tones of the soundtrack slowly haunting you as you hesitantly move forward through the rooms.\n\nLayers of Fear introduction perfectly encapsulates a mysteriousness that had me paralyzed. Enraptured by the setting and the fear of what was to come next, it all felt vividly real. Especially with how beautiful the set pieces were room to room. On ultra settings, it's very easy to marvel at your surroundings with it's soft shadows reflecting off the dim lighted halls throughout. It's as pretty as a picture, as if it were carefully sculpted by the artist himself. The artist seems to have an obsession with perfection as when you listen to an auditory flashback of when he finds his muse, his proposal comes off eerily strange in retrospect. He wanted to put his name on the most beautiful woman in the world, just like the rest of his paintings . His object of affection was beauty at it's core, but what happens when the beauty fades?\n\nAs you find out, one way or another the beauty has faded from his life. And once it does, so does his inspiration for painting. He hits a giant roadblock which is expressed visually within the game. You the player, has to help the painter find just the right items to help him finish his masterpiece. But the house isn't what it once seemed, closed off walls will appear where they were once open hallways. You will go in circles and circles while the game will openly remind you through scrawled writings on the wall. The artist's inner narrative uses his house's walls as the canvas, giving you insight as to how he feels on his deranged journey to reclaiming his lost inspiration. They seem like ramblings of a madman at first but subtly aid you to progress in the game.\n\nThe mansion's are like the inner frameworks of his mind, cluttered and confusing. Neverending, yet constantly closing the paths behind you. What was once a simple mansion is now an endless mind palace that transforms at his whims, with his deepest fears manifesting , clouding the golden years where he was once hailed as a genius. The mansion from Layers of Fears strikingly resembles a similar theme from a book called House of Leaves by Mark Z. Danielewski. In the novel, the house initially has larger internal measurements than external. Over time, the interior of the house seems to slowly expand until a hallway appears that should lead outside to where the yard is but does not. The interesting aspect is that the book also has an unusual page layout and style, making it visually surrealist in it's own way.\n\nLayers of Fears feels like it's takes this surrealist form one step further and perfects the execution using it's strong visual tricks and audial cues. Walls will shift, hallways will reverse, invert, making each room feel slightly familiar yet alien to both the player and the painter. Misdirection is key here, something Layers of Fears pulls of meticulously. The game will consistently find new ways to surprise you visually with it's metamorphic atmosphere, and this is only accomplished by the player being a witness to the painter's madness.\n\nThis is the majority of what you'll be doing all game, exploring dark dreary rooms for notes and items that will help you on your quest to finish a painting. Although it would be categorized as a exploration game, it feels more like an on rails horror set. Once you're finished with a room, you can never go back making you feel like a puppet being dragged from A to B with very little to interact with except a couple drawers or shelves to find notes about past events in no real chronological order. It's mainly up to the player to decide how badly he wants to find out what's really happening in the game by opening 100s of drawers in hopes of finding more notes. You never truly feel like a player in the game interacting with the world, more like another set piece that the artist has created for you to be a witness into his madness. It's when the game does take complete control away from you, does it feel truly unique. Helpless to the panorama of horrors slowly settling closer and closer, claustrophobia settling in to the point helplessness. Your control is truly gone, you are no longer a player but a set piece just as much the painter is and it feels wonderfully surreal.\n\nThe second and final act of the game delves heavily into psychedelic hallucinatory levels, where set pieces transform before you into sublimely grotesque imaginations of the painter. The problem is that the shock value of the similar jump scares have worn off at this point, and that I have absolutely nothing to fear. The first time I encounter a monster roaming the hallways, I'm terrified by the games brilliant usage of the lighting system. But you soon quickly realize that there's nothing to be done about them. The hallways are always narrow and small and the doors lock behind you so you have no choice but to either wait and see or just walk towards them and brave the brunt of their psychological attack. Once you realize that it almost feels like your 'death' is a plot progressor. This removes probably the most vital 'layer of fear' within the game. Once the element of fear is taken away, and replaced with plot progress you're no longer traumatized by their appearance but considering a quick death to move on. While you continue to march forward to find the final piece of puzzle to put the story all together, the ambiguous and surrealist nature never quite grants you that clear resolution rather leaving it up to the player's interpretation by how many notes he found throughout the short three hour game.\n\nOverall Layers of Fear is a technical marvel that is both hauntingly beautiful and surreptitiously ambiguous in nature. While the ambiguity drives the narrative forward through the character's interpretation of the artist's evocative imaginings of his mansion, the game slowly loses it's pulse of mysteriousness through the over use of jump scare tropes and identical monster encounters but never it's beauty. I recommend Layers of Fear to players who want an exploration based game who don't mind letting their imagination run wild and want to enjoy a fresh surrealist take on the genre.","March 4","true","3.5"," 41 of 52 people (79%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","79","41","52","7","0"

Instead of focusing on jump scares using monsters it uses it's own unique horror. It actually does this very well and I have to say it's probably the most scared I have ever been at a horror game.\n\nThe horror this game focuses on is a psychedelic kind of horror. While exploring the house you will experience changing scenery and corridors without you even looking. You often find when turning around that you are now in a completely different room to where you was before. What this does is it creates a fear of turning around. Literally one of my biggest fears while playing was turning around because you never have any idea what you are gonna find. I also never found myself looking behind the curtains as such by seeing the walls change myself.\n\nThey then obviously had to include jump scares. This is more often than not done by ways of paintings. They often dissolve or mold into something else more scary. These jump scares I find rather unique and I loved them. But then the game also throws in a lot of cheap jump scares. These include things like pots being thrown at a wall and slamming doors. Although they definitely did scare me I find them rather boring and uninspired. I just felt like they needed something to fill the time spent exploring.\n\nThe game also features a story. It tells a rather disturbing story of a man and his wife which I won't spoil. I'll just say you may cringe listening to some of it. It is told in a kinda "gone home" style. This means by picking up items you will learn more about the story. Some is through reading extracts and others you will hear the main character reminiscing about the past. I will also add here that the actor is incredible with his voice work. Some people may be put off by this way of story telling but to me, having loved gone home, I also loved this storytelling choice.\n\nThe story is also open to interpretation I believe. Soemtimes the game is rather vague in these story extracts. It's probably quite meaningfully doing this so you can yourself interpret the story how you want. The game doesn't always tell the story in a logical order of events. This story isn't complete yet so i can't say how I feel about an ending.\n\nLayers of fear does seem to have a goal. You are seemingly building up a painting. We don't yet know what the painting will represent but it is definitely looking disturbing. To build this painting you will have to find items around the house to paint with. These aren't your regular painting items and you end up finding stuff like bones to paint with. Yep quite disturbing.\n\nOne thing people may dislike is that Layers of Fear is an almost entirely linear experience. For the first kind of 10 minutes of the game you are able to freely explore the house. After this you are locked into the games linear routes. If you don't like linear games then this isn't for you.\n\nA problem I have is that sometimes the experience didn't seem to quite flow. I mean sometimes the soundtrack didn't flow into each other and the events seemed to just be random without any real meaning to why they were happening. I think going forward this game needs to try and make events link together to make it slightly more fun and horrifying.\n\nThe big problem I have with Layers of Fear comes later in the game. Notice how earlier I was saying I loved the unique way of horror they use and how they don't use monsters. Well this isn't entirely true. Near to the end of the current experience a monster is introduced. The monster seems to become the heart of the experience from there on. I think they should really consider removing this monster and crafting more of the unique horror experience in it's place instead. It may be scary but I don't think it really has a place in this game.\n\nGraphics wise I had no problems whatsoever. The art style isn't unique by any means but what it does with the art style is definitely unique. Performance was Ok. It varied between 30-60 fps on my mid range system. It could probably do with some optimization.\n\nOverall Layers of Fear really freaked me out and is the most scared I think i've ever been at a horror game. It's unique version of horror is what really makes it stand out. It took me just over 90 minutes to complete it in it's current entirety which may be a little short. However the price point is really cheap at £6.99 so I think it's worth it. I definitely look forward to play more of it but I hope they consider some of the changes I proposed.\n\nTheIronicGamers rating system\nDon't ever buy this game.\nMaybe consider it on a sale.\nAn average game.\nA good game that should definitely be considered.\nA must play!\nDisclaimer: I was provided a review key for free by the developer to make this review.","September 6, 2015","true","6.3"," 36 of 44 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","36","44","0","2"

With a broad range of traditional scares, it strives to terrorize the player with as many different tricks as possible. For some, it will be overwhelming, and perhaps the game could have provided more downtime—or at least something more substantial than searching through empty drawers for notes. Replaying the adventure results in a severe decrease in terror because the story plays out nearly identically. However, that does not change the fact that Layers of Fear will send shivers down your spine during its first attempt, thanks to many careful jump scares. With a steady increase in terror, Layers of Fear is a horror game that succeeds through its variety.\n\nRead full review[www.newgamenetwork.com]","February 23","true","4.3"," 28 of 31 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","28","31","0","0"

Easily one of the best horror experiences in the last few years.

The atmostphere in the game is very well crafted and you always feel on edge. This is in part due to brilliant sound design and creepy atmosphere and the imagery which is really quite something special and one of the strongest points of this game. You never quite know what freaky crap is going to happen next or where it will take you.\n\nThere are a small number of jumpscares throughout, but they are not over done and the ones that are in the game are done very well. There are quite a few horror clichés as well but are so well done you don't care how cheesy they are.\nThis game is absolutely crazy. Once you get into the locked room in the mansion (right at the start), that's when everything goes straight to hell.\n\nLayers of Fear is a brilliant game and an absolute mindf*ck that plunges you into the mind of an artist who is rapidly descending into utter madness.\n\nIf you like horror, I highly recommend this game.","February 18","true","9.1"," 27 of 30 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","27","30","2","0"

Layers of Fear is nothing short of a horror masterpiece. The tone and mood that is set immedietely once you begin to play is one of dread and paranoia. It has a bit of a build up, presenting itself as more of a "Gone Home", until a few minutes in when it decides it's been nice enough to you, and simply wants to scare and disturb you in ways that outshine games like PT.\n\nThe graphical stylings are simply amazing. After playing countless terrible indie horror games in Unity, seeing a game that can look this good in the engine is a breath of fresh air in a room of farts. Each room is designed and decorated perfectly. It captures the era and also the gradual descent into madness. The use of colors and art gives this game true feeling.\n\nThe sound design is effective and terrifying. A small sound cue will make you turn around to find that the room has suddenly changed. The cries of a woman lure you down a hallway, to then suddenly start banging on a door to have you running in terror.\n\nI am so impressed with this game, I cannot recommend it enough.","August 27, 2015","true","5.6"," 28 of 32 people (88%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","88","28","32","4","1"

If you played or watched PT and you enjoyed what you saw, this is must buy. This is definitely an experience that leaves most horror games in the dust. It makes you dread moving forward, yet the enviroment and events that occur make you scream 'I MUST EXPLORE'.\n\nMost horror games succeed in making you feel stressed, tense using that as the overall emotion of the game. However, seeing this game described as 'psychedelic-horror' there is no truer title/genre than just that. While it may not provide the sense of urgency or peril as Amnesia or Alien: Isolation, this games atmosphere proves to be truly creepy and bizarre in a way that makes you wish it wouldn't end.\n\nThe 'Early Access' status typically stopped me from going further or even giving the game a chance. But I am so glad that I have taken a chance on this game because it seems so promising. If you are a fan of horror games, Layers Of Fear will surely surpass your expectations.","August 28, 2015","true","6.9"," 23 of 25 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","23","25","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SexBombEverywhere/recommended/391720/","SexBombEverywhere","Tommy Wiseau","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SexBombEverywhere/","510 products in account","I never had such mixed feelings for a game before I played Layers of Fear. The first hour of it was absolutely exhilarating, props to the devs for absolutely nailing the bone-chilling atmosphere. Jump scares were minimal and the ever-changing layout of the protagonist's mansion helped alleviate the theme of insanity. I honestly regarded the game as one of the best horror games ever made, making even the likes of Amnesia pale in comparison.\n\nThen, I got bored. The repetitiveness of the game did not bring out a sense of fear as it initially did, but instead brought out one of boredom. 2 hours in, and I didn't give a crap about the obviously painstakingly crafted environment, the changing layouts of the house and even the jump scares, and that wasn't all because of the repetitive nature of the game, about halfway through the game, there was a scene involving a ghost baby running into a drawer, how anyone found that to be even the least bit scary is beyond me. From then on, I failed to take the game seriously, the "babyface" artwork that intentionally sent shivers down my spine for being disturbing soon descended to be nothing more than a funny face.\n\nThe thing which Outlast and Amnesia got right is that they never showed their hand too early on, they always had something new to offer. Granted, Layers of Fear had me more terrified than either game, but as I mentioned earlier, this fear faded away to boredom, whereas Outlast and Amnesia had in me a sense of dread, a sense of actual fear, from the beginning, all the way to the end, and that was probably due to the actual threat the enemies faced in both games. The antagonist in Layers of Fear was nothing more than a jump scare machine. With the realization that there is no actual threat to the player, Layers of Fear soon became nothing more than a walking simulator with jumpscares added for good measure.\n\nAll in all, I really wanted to like this game, and I did, at first. Unfortunately, Layers of Fear is nothing more than a sad case of wasted potential. The story is pretty decent but the gameplay really really gets boring after a while, and the "sanity"-like aspect of the game becomes a dumb gimmick at a certain point in the game. Also, I want to point out that this game has 3 endings. Sorry devs, but I think a single playthrough is enough for me.\n","April 2","false","3.5"," 48 of 71 people (68%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","68","48","71","3","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/melancholyrose/recommended/391720/","melancholyrose","Mel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/melancholyrose/","77 products in account","Paint by Nightmares\nOverviewThis is a mixed review that doesn’t have entirely nicey-nice things to say, and if I could give the game a star rating, it’d be 3.5 out of 5.\nI bought this game during Early Acess and reviewed it then. I wasn't as detailed as I would have liked. Now that the game is fully released, I'd like to reassess my opinion of it... because while the game is amazing in a lot of ways, it also disappointed me in other areas. Layers of Fear really shines in the horror genre for stepping away from the survival action aspect and comes forward to being completely story-driven, but what it gains in storytelling, it lacks in horrifying me in the way I hoped.\nI have played the game multiple times during Early Access, and completed the fully-released game once.\n\nThe Positives1) The story itself. It’s deliciously dark. I might be a little biased when it comes to enjoying the story, because like the protagonist, I'm also an artist, so it spoke to me in ways other horror games don't. The main story has a very cryptic nature to it, and it doesn't come right out and tell you what's going on-- you figure it out on your own by inspecting letters and items. I enjoy that kind of writing.\n\n2) The "insane" feeling you get when wandering the house. My favorite kind of horror is psychological, as I don't believe in ghosts or demons, and therefore don't find them scary. So, as you might imagine, I'm very tired of games or movies involving demons or possessions or haunted houses. This game seems to be almost entirely a mind-trip, as it plays off of what you might consider common for a game to have or include, then changes it. It surprises you by throwing twists and angles you didn't expect, thus giving you the feeling you are "going insane". I loved that feeling, and it made me love the game.\n\n3) The visuals and sound were done very well. That goes without saying when complimenting its nuanced style of psychologically-influenced gameplay, but they also look amazing in other areas. The lighting is perfect at times, as are the many paintings on the walls. The sound is haunting and creeps its way into your brain with eerie, low piano music, hums and static fizzles. Playing this game with headphones on seems almost necessary. That voice acting, though… it’s all right, but not the best.\n\nThe Negatives1) I hate saying "such and such part of the game was easy!" because it insults anyone who got stuck on a particular part of the game, which I find to be tasteless. Some things are obvious to people in games, and for others, we overthink it, because we assume to be in a game that's more complicated than it is. I have fallen victim to this trap many times.\n\nIn my personal opinion, the “puzzles” weren’t challenging enough. I don't even think they should be considered "puzzles," because they required almost no solving. Usually the solution was something like "turn on light switch" or "light the candle" in order to see a certain number or letter on the wall. Maybe the game didn't intend to be heavy on the puzzles, so I can't blame it too much for this. It’s likely they didn’t want the game’s precious, though minimal three hours of time to be bogged down by “solving” things. I’ll give it a slight pass on this one, since the quick, simple feeling of the game might be my personal preference to be challenged by something.\n\n2) The Silent Hills P.T. has influenced this game a lot, and while that isn't really a negative... there were some things that felt directly ripped off of it. Like Ghost Wife leaping at you and grabbing your face and shaking her head around like she's on twenty ounces of speed.. While I never played the P.T., I did watch playthroughs of it, and honestly, it was in a class all its own. Others can mimic it, but it felt like it did something right. And even just watching those playthroughs terrified me more than playing this game did.\n\n3) Jump scares aren't scary. Maybe other people disagree with me on that, but I've never been afraid of them. Yeah, I jump when something goes "BWWWAAAH!" because that's an organic response. I don't feel "scared" afterward. I just feel annoyed. Layers of Fear uses mostly jump scares to deliver its horror to you. While I loved the "insanity" feeling mentioned above, I hate that it just used generic methods of scaring you rather than make something look and feel horrifying just by looking at it and feeling horrified. There are the occasional "Whoa, that's effed up" paintings that have creepy, grimacing faces that send chills down my spine, but those moments are rare, and honestly, there wasn’t nearly enough of that. I wanted more of the “good god, that painting is watching me” rather than the “BOO! GOTCHA!”\n\n4) I've beaten the game and I still don't know any of the characters' names. Would be nice to feel as though I was part of an identity so that I could relate to them. If you can learn their names, and I just didn't manage do, forgive this note. However, I don't think finding out the name of the character you play should be a mystery.\n\n5) There are multiple endings to the game (3 to be exact), but there's no way to know how to get them unless you look it up online and possibly spoil it for yourself. I hate games that do this. I already know the other endings, and I know how to get them-- but I had to look up what I was supposed to do (and thus spoiled them for myself, so I have no reason to replay the game). This is also an indication that to get the more "complete" of endings, you need walkthroughs to know where to pick up the items (because it isn't always very clear). I was as thorough as I could possibly be in my previous playthrough and I still somehow missed a lot of items.\n\n6) Game length is shorter than what I'm used to. The fully-completed game took me about three hours. Twenty bucks… for three hours. Just no. Get it on sale.\n\nFinal ThoughtsWhile I do have a lot of nitpicks, I still recommend Layers of Fear to all horror fans. Why? Well, mostly because it's unique, and tries to do something new (well, new-ish). It's not an FPS, it's not an action game, it's not even a survival game (which seem to plague the market these days). It's a story-based game, and when all said and done, it is good at telling the story. I do wish, however, that the game had been more atmospheric, and less predictable in its execution. And I know this might sound stupid to some people… but I wish it was scarier.","May 11","true","11.9"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","20","23","0","3"

Honestly, i'm at the loss for words here.\nThe game itself looks brilliant, the atmosphere build up is absolutely gorgeous. It makes your jaw drop, and i find it interesting how much it makes enjoyable to feel fear and how much it plays with false sense of security. The story is intriguing, not many modern horror games can say that. I'm not going to compare this to any other game for a simple reason: This game is on a whole new level. It amazingly portrays the insanity, the mayhem in a deluded person's head. One must be open to interpretation. So far, i liked what i saw, this has a potential to become so much more, a trailblazer for modern horror games. Now, there are some elements that you might find it familiar, but i think, they were scrapped and unused in other projects, wasted potential, thus used in THIS game to it's full extent. I'm not gonna lie, i didn't know the weight of my decisions that i made, let me tell you one word - explore. Layers of Fear is one of the best horror games i played and it's still in early access. I want to commend the developers for such a game, you fellas have absolutely no shame, brilliant geniuses. At first i thought i'd list all the phobias that i encountered in the game, but honestly, the list would be too long. If you don't believe me, by all means, try this game out, and experience for yourself. I will update the review as the game develops.\nThe technical part of the game is stunning aswell. Graphics are beautiful and (terrible?) at the same time, the sfx and soundtrack are well suited and tuned. Everything in it's own accord, i did however experienced a slight drop in fps, at the very early part of the game, in a kitchen, at the left top corner, perhaps map rendering. Nothing too serious, because the game was like a finely tuned piano afterwards, for the rest of the playthrough. I really enjoyed this so far, and i'm looking forward to a full release. The best and worst experience you had in a  while.","September 13, 2015","true","4.2"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","19","22","3","1"

The puzzles you will encounter are not very challenging, but can be anoying sometimes, like looking for tiny objects in a dark room.To many of the scares rely on very generic horror-tropes, like scary dolls or objects getting thrown at you, when you don´t expect it, wich is a bit of a shame, because the haunted house that keeps restructuring itself over and over is done quite well. The story , that gets told by notes you find is decent but not great. Without spoiling to much, it could be summarized as "Edgar Alan Poe´s take on The Shining".\nOverall  a game that has some remarkable moments, but does not fully reach it´s potential, because it plays the same old tricks to often.","February 16","false","4.0"," 71 of 114 people (62%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","62","71","114","3","0"

I mean like really good suspense horror. It's got amazing amosphere, wonderful emersion, and attention to detail. This is what a horror game should be. It has just the right amount of jump scares that build up tense moments, and keep you wondering what is around the next door.  If you love intense story driven horror games, get this game! Like right now! Why are you reading this still!? Get this game.\n\nNow for the cons. There are few besides it's short, 3 hours, but it's still EA. I hope to see at least another 5-10 hours added to this game. Tho I'm not sure how they could extend it out and keep it interesting. I have a feeling there is maybe 3 hours of story left for them to tell. But still good for a horror game. The other issue is frame rate. This game is graphiclly great looking. But I have a GTX980 and get sub 15 fps in some areas. For no reason. In the start of the game I was a solid 60 fps at 2160p. By the end of the game I was lucky to be at 30 fps at 1080p. This game needs a lot of optimizing for sure. For a EA game this is polished and looking great. Other issues are lack of audio in some areas. There is a room with a lot of floating objects, but they don't make a sound when you touch them. Things go flying all over the room and not a sound for them. There are also some bleed over issues from ajcent rooms. Playing on headphones as you should with this game, the sounds are to abrupt and break the imersion when they over lap in a odd way.\n\nI also played this on TrinusVR with my phone, and it worked wonderfully. I was very happy with it in VR. This is the type of experience that VR is wonderful at. Now if my Nexus 4 only had a higher resolution screen. Running at sub 720p on the phone really takes away from the games beauty on my 4k monitor.\n\nBravo to the devs. This is the type of quailty EA game we need on steam. I look forward to the ending of this game.","August 29, 2015","true","3.4"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","94","16","17","4","0"

But what is doing great is the horror and the graphics.\n\nThe high level of detail, the graphics style (that itself reminds of an painting) and the excellent sound and voice acting form astonishingly great atmosphere. The jumpscares are ingenoious and effective enough (means mostly not too hard) while not using loud sounds as a cheap way to do so. The game keeps playing with your mind and surprises all the time with new ideas. The large amount of really good paintings and drawings are making this game to an true art project.

The world changes around you, much like a painter who is forever recreating and changing his art work. The never ending search for perfection!\n\nThe whole game fills the player with many different emotions, depending on the play style you take. Are you a selfish artist? Are you a regretful husband? Are you a loving parent? These questions and more, give the player a real sense of life and helps create an excellent atmosphere for each step you take.\n\nFor an indie developer, Bloober Team, have created a "master piece", not only in story but in the amazing world they built. The eye to detail makes you stop at every little item, just to see the work put into it. With great art, comes some magnificient sound. Music and sound effects sit perfectly with the tone of the game, whilst the amazing voice acting captures the heart.\n\nWith 3 distinct endings, based on every choice you do, every item you grab and read, it makes for lots of replayability. I spent almost 24 hours just to get all three endings and I tell you, it wasn't a walk in the park! The game challenges you on a deep psychological level, especially to get these different endings. Much time and patience is needed for all three.\n\nJust like all great works of art, this will live on as a cult classic game for those who love something entirely different!\n\n5 out of 5 Beers from me!\n\nCheers,\nFrost","March 29","true","24.2"," 21 of 29 people (72%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","72","21","29","4","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/overvulture/recommended/391720/","overvulture","Menacing Tentacles","http://steamcommunity.com/id/overvulture/","583 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThe rare sort of horror game that can still genuinely surprise me, Layers of Fear is unique and creative in its vision in a way so many others in the genre are not. Not just uniquely scary, but actually genuinely intriguing. Rather than just feeling like a train ride to the next Jumpscare Station, it's a journey that kept me wondering what's behind each new door and excited to play more of it. The unpredictability makes for a special kind of tension that's so much better than the anticipation of something about to jump out. Having no idea what else could possibly happen meant every second I played I was on edge.\n\nEarly access seems like a weird choice for a horror title that doesn't bank on replay value or multiplayer or so on. Purchasing now means you'll experience the first two thirds or so of the game, and then be greeted suddenly by a "stay tuned for more!" screen before any sort of wrap-up. I was disappointed by that, but at the same time the game does everything so well that I'm really glad to have this one in my library and can't wait to go through it all again. I feel like I didn't see everything the first time through, so I'm looking forward to playing from the start when the game's fully released.\n\nFor those looking for combat or stealth elements or whatever, you're not going to find those here. This one is all about environmental horror and surprising the player, not about panic or running away from monsters. The horror is a slow burn, and it builds up wonderfully, with only a select few sudden jumpouts mixed in with everything else. Keeping them rare is so much more effective, and they're well-delivered for the most part. People who hate what they call "walking simulators" might dislike this one, but even when you're not actively threatened as a player the game has so many surprises in store for you the tension remains high. I was much more spooked by thinking "what's going to happen when I do this?" than the threat of a game over screen could ever make me. It won't work for everyone, but if you're willing to stop thinking like a gamer and just get lost in the experience, you'll get the most out of it.\n\nI'm a bit iffy on the writing and voice acting. I found the cuts to monologues when you find a special object laying around to be distracting and break the flow a little. The acting itself isn't bad, but for whatever reason it didn't really feel like it fit into the game for me. It didn't hurt the overall product much, but the game does a much better job of telling its creepy, artist-gone-insane story when it's using your surroundings rather than monologue, setting up more of a mystery with its many twisted rooms than when it just stops you to let the painter remind you just how crazy he is. A weak point, but not a dealbreaker by any means.\n\nOverall Layers of Fear is a fantastic horror game that really stands apart from the generic jump scare feeding troughs that keep getting churned out. The early access status is something you might want to be wary of, but in its current state there's a lot to be impressed by and a lot of promise for the future finished product. Buy it now, or at least keep an eye on it if you're even remotely a horror fan.","January 12","true","4.6"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","3"

At the beginning, it was what I expected it to be. I had fun exploring the house and trying to piece together what exactly happened here.  By the second half of the game, I was waiting for it to be over because I was honestly extremely bored. The same things happened over and over again, there was little to no story at this point,  I'm still not entirely sure what the story even is.  Plus, I'm easily scared and by the end of the game, I was not even phased by what was happening around me because I was already expecting it.\n\nThe gameplay only consists of walking around and opening cabinets and doors.  Which wouldn't really be a problem until you realize that more then half the drawers and things I'm opening don't have anything in them.  It got really boring, really fast.

Well, let me put that rumor to rest with beginning this review by saying that Layers of Fear is a Unity based horror game... and it's one of the absolute best horror titles that I've played in the last five years. In fact, it has easily entered into my top ten favorite horror games of all time. Layers of Fear easily stands strong along side current-era favorites such as The Evil Within and Stairs, and it brings along its own unique brand of psychological horror.\n\nYou will take on the role of an unnamed painter, and you quickly find out that he has a wife, a daughter, an unsettling obsession with rats, and a taste for the sauce. The game starts out ordinary enough, you wander through your rather large mansion, pick up notes that give glimpses into the story, and then you grab the key to your painting study and enter. However, once you unveil your unfinished Magnum Opus, things start taking a turn for the wild, weird, and eerie. Once you exit your studio, your entire mansion has transformed; you will traverse from claustrophobic corridors to wide open rooms, through radical hallucinations and segments that will truly make you second guess yourself.\n\nIf you have seen the Silent Hills Playable Trailer that released a few years ago, many elements within Layers of Fear will seem familiar; in fact, Layers of Fear truly is an incarnation of the gameplay we've seen in the now defunct Silent Hills PT. Sometimes you will wander through the same area, only to have it gradually change over time, or you'll come to a dead end and look behind you, only to have something new appear. Every twist and turn that you make potentially sets off a new string of events, each more horrific than the last. Though this is not all for the glory of horror, there is a deep, grim, and depressing underlying story that everyone should take the time to understand; through gathering and reading notes, of course. It seems that so many horror games of this era have an unbridled obsession with note collecting, and while that is present in Layers of Fear, it's never the primary focus or goal; it simply enhances the few dialogue driven sections.\n\nThe performance of the game is outstanding, and it has given me renewed hope in Unity based horror games. In fact, as far as my memory can recall, this is the only Unity based horror game that I've played that has not suffered from blasphemous performance. A solid 95% of the game runs at a smooth 60 FPS, with graphics cranked to full max, while the very small 4% sees the game dipping into the mid 40's, and 1% where the game will go down to roughly 38. The latter issue is found in the very tail end of the game, and is hardly worth mentioning; but it is still there. Layers of Fear is beautiful, though, the graphics are outstanding and well polished in all areas; even the paint-soaked, gore-ridden parts.\n\nThis game is one that is better played while wearing a headset, as the ambiance is very subtle. Using my 7.1 Surround Sound Corsair Void headset, I noted that the sound is incredibly clear and uncompressed. Everything from the dialogue, to eerie laughing, crying, to more natural sounds such as the ongoing storm outside of the mansion. Layers of Fear could probably have used a slight bit more in the way of atmospheric ambiance, as many times it seems that the only thing that there is to focus on are the sounds of your own footsteps; which sounds like a heart beating, at least in my opinion.\n\nIf you're looking for one of the best horror experiences of this year, or even in the last decade, I recommend Layers of Fear with all of the fiery passion that one who loves horror so much can. Not only are all of the right horror elements there, aside from Silent Hills PT and perhaps Stairs, this is one of the earliest incarnations of this type of psychological horror; one that changes and shifts each time you enter and exit a room. There's even a hint of Rose Red laying within the developer's inspiration. I have played tons and tons of horror titles over the years, and Layers of Fear is one of the extremely few that have actually made me question myself and what I'm doing at certain points. If it can trick me, you're sure to be astounded with it. If you need one more thing to set you off... it also doesn't rely on jumpscares. Now, go press the "add to cart" button.\n\nRating: 5.0/5.0 - An astonishing achievement, this game must be played.Belphegore's Hell House Reviews (Group)","February 29","true","4.2"," 18 of 25 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","18","25","0","1"

Reason why its like PT is because of the graphics are almost similar and the scare factor is the same. Beautiful, sublime music will play here and there whilst the most exquisite paintings will haunt you for the rest of the night!!! Oh, and its not just repetitive pop up scares but rather unique and terrifying with the most intriguing room mutations with the help of "PAINT"!  And the sound. Oh my god, the sound!!!!!!\n\nSince its in early access only half the game is completed and I only encountered one bug where a room went pitch black forever.

Can't wait for a full release. I finished the EA version in one take and holy hell, was it a journey.\n\nYou are going to read about visuals a lot and that's because indeed, the game is stunningly beautiful. The detail put into every little nook and cranny, every object, every texture, the lighting FX, everything regarding visuals is just perfect in this game.\n\nThe level design IS A MASTERPIECE. I can't count the moments I spent in pure awe or wondering what the flipping bananas is going on. Just so creative and mesmerising. I don't want to give anything away, so play it for yourself and you'll see what I'm talking about.\n\nThis is a horror game. Despite the horror cliches and one single element I didn't like in the game, it delivers the creeps and chills just perfectly. Prepare for constant jumpscaring that will keep you on your toes, but simultaneously, there are many different elements that add to the horror experience in this game and they are present all the time. It is very, very psychological. Trust me, you will be SERIOUSLY creeped out and immersed into the wickedness of the main character pretty much during the whole game. There are some seriously disturbing scenes that really pushed my limits, but I kept going and the game kept delivering, slowly driving you into pure insanity.\n\nThe gameplay itself is pretty simple, but completely sufficient and the occasional (though very simple) "puzzles" fit the game well.\n\nAs far as story goes, I can't wait for the full version to reach the conclusion. Again, this is very psychological and will get inside your mind and bend it in many disturbing ways. The simplicity of the gameplay enables a clear, but still very twisted explanation of what's going on in the game.\n\nThe concept itself is very intriguing and overall, this is a definite must-have for all horror fans. I don't even want to imagine what this is like in VR. Holy hell.\n\nI am now off to get myself a new adrenal gland as this one is now drained out from the experience I had.\n\n10/10 Would paint again.","August 27, 2015","true","5.8"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","14","18","2","0"

The horror aspects are modeled very closely to the playable teaser from Hideo Kojima and Guillermo del Toro, otherwise known a PT, wherein your character is trapped in a house with a vengeful ghost, and your goal is make it through.\n\nGraphically the game is beautiful, as long as your PC is up to snuff, everything is well detailed and pops with vibrance; from the general house itself, to the black, inky corruption that slowly engulfs the husband's sanity.\n\nJump-scares are the primary go-to for the game's horror element, and although they're often predictable, there were several times when things got quiet, and I honestly felt unnerved and tense.\n\nThe faults I find come from the controls, and the game's length. Similar to another series by Frictional Games, Layers of Fear attempts to use a grab and pull mechanic, where you click an object, and then move your mouse in order to open doors, cabinets, and solve puzzles. Although I enjoy the control in general, It isn't as polished as Soma or Amnesia.\n\nThe other problem, and it's only a minor one, is the game's length. Even taking your time, you can finish it in a few hours. Depending on your preference, this may not be an issue, but personally, I like my games to be a little longer.\n\nThose issues aside, I really enjoyed the game! It might be a walking simulator with a few puzzles, but Layers of fear is still worth your time.","February 21","true","5.1"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","3"

I guess it starts that way...\n\nThis game is an absolute masterpiece of atmospheric terror and a great example of how to take primal fears and play them against the player. You don't need to be stalked by an enemy (ie Demento/Haunting Ground) for a large house to be scary. In fact you don't need anything LIVING in it, at all... (emphasis...).\n\nI have never been so afraid of an empty house, ever... Yet at the same time compelled to keep going to unveil the truth. As you keep going, the game begins to feel more like SH4 in that the 'sanctuary' (for lack of any term...) being the art studio itself becomes more and more corrupted by evil. Yet its not a 'fantasy' evil, which is why this game is so horrendously frightening...\n\nThe story is one of madness, and an 'evil' borne of madness. It is not fantasy, it is all reality, and a very deep, dark disturbing look at exactly how low the human psyche can fall. It is an 'evil' that exists in the hearts of many, and because its something we can associate with, it simply makes the entire premise all the more frightening.\n\nIf having no combat makes this a walking simulator, then 10/10 would walk and ♥♥♥♥ my pants all over again.","August 28, 2015","true","3.8"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","10","11","3","0"

The story wasn't particularly interesting and it did the exact same thing every other "psychological horror" game has done. Granted, it did them slightly better than in a lot, but 'slightly better' doesn't make it a master piece. You solve about 5 number 'puzzles' that are not puzzles; it's look at the wall, find 3 numbers, put them in to X (With X being 'thing that requires numbers'). It took 40+ people to make a mediocre 2 hour corridor walking simulator with light psychological horror elements.\n\nSave your money and watch a youtube playthrough of it or just buy it for $5 on a sale if you have two-to-three hours of time you wouldn't rather spend doing something fun.\n\n\n\nObviously if you disagree then that's fine.

There's no way to actually die - you can pick up items, walk, and run. The game wants you to believe you're in danger, but you never are. The fear is entirely shallow, which is upsetting considering how great the actual appearance of things is.\n\nThoughout the game I was constantly trying to mess with the hallucinations to see if the game let me have any player agency, but time and time again it was a scripted death on a linear path. The times that did manage to scare me were when you'd get to a locked door at the end of a hallway, turn around, and there was a loud jumpscare waiting for you. Or when I'd walk into a pretty room, check the fireplace, and when I'd turn around everything in the room would fly towards me and become discheveled on the ground. There's a LOT of turning-around puzzles/spooks but they usually caught me off guard 80% of the time.\n\nDespite playing an early-release review copy, I found zero bugs - save for cabinet and dresser drawers occasionally not recognizing when I tried to grab them.\n\nThis is one of those games that I would rate "Neutral" if Steam would allow it, but for now I'll have to give it a reluctant no, solely because, while the game is cool, it obviously took a lot from PT and Amnesia - too much, really - but didn't execute them quite as well as I'd hoped. Combining that with the price tag, I can't justify paying more than 15 dollars for this 4-hour walking experience.","February 12","false","4.8"," 39 of 68 people (57%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","57","39","68","6","1"

Despite being an early access, this game is honestly more functional than some fully released games. I managed to get through to the end of what has been made so far in about 2 hours and in that time I have experienced some truly spooky ♥♥♥♥. You can easily tell this game knows exactly what it wants to be and how it plans on achieving that. The atmosphere is chilling and sinister; lighting, sound and the amazing graphics truly make make this game stand out. The story telling is also very well realized through notes, items, interactions and even dialogue. A supernatural/physiological tour of haunted house with constant changing hallways and terrifying imagery. Some of the set pieces will most likely make you want to stop for a minute and just look around. Speaking of which, the imagery in this game is fantastic! Grotesque, insidious and beautifully horrific in the best of ways. I found myself taking screenshots of paintings, hallways and rooms covered in black liquid. So far this is the best horror game of 2015, I really like how insanely well realized and put together this game is.The game does use jump scares but often times I found it best when I was forced to go somewhere I desperately did not want to go, or was helpless to watch something creep towards me. The gameplay is somewhat minimal, walking around looking for what you can interact with(almost anything) and seeing if it has any use. Although the gameplay could be summarized as walking around and finding keys or the crazy sketches of a madman, I think walking simulator is a bit unfair but kind of true(I don't mind it but don't expect to be running from monsters and hiding under beds). Overall I think this game is well worth $10.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyxCysYwl68 Video of gameplay","August 28, 2015","true","2.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Without their ingenuity and artistic immersion, I would not have entered that contest in the first place and desire to win so much. Their artists (especially the one of my portrait, Andrzej Dybowski) are fantastic, the marketing and PR Manager Rafał Basaj is also a great guy. They are obviously a great team and I look forward to seeing more of their work in the future.\n\nThe only downside of the game is that it is short, and I think that is the only reason it is not a $60 game. I guess the only downside is when you have a small break during gameplay, like in the workshop (like a safe room), you have thoughts that creep into your mind..."I hope this doesn't end" and "I am getting really close to the end now, dang." It's a game that compells you to see what is next.\n\nMy only hope is that we see more of their work in the future, and hopefully DLC or some kind of additional content, but for now, I am content. This is a finished and well-made game. No bugs or anything.\n\nFor those that haven't played since release: they changed a lot of the rooms. It's a new experience. I played through pre-release several times and always had trouble remembering what was coming next, but post-release, it's a whole new level.

Well, as you can imagine, the games story gets  deeper that that - You'll have to collect certain mementos (which I cannot name due to them being spoilers) to finish named painting... I can tell you, that those aren't your typical souvenirs but way more sinister objects... During your search for those you'll stumble upon more objects to pick up and collect which will involve you more with the games (by the way very well made) lore! You'll slowly uncover the secrets and make connections - eventually comming to a uncanny conclusion! The explorartion and search for those items, along with mutliple endings are a good reason to play through "Layers of Fear" multiple times, the game is variable and there will most certainly be new paths to discover upon making different (walking-) choices... The only negative aspect I found here is, that you will not take that long to play through the game (only up to 6 hours on my first playthrough, and those due to me playing really slow and careful)...\nThe games graphics are fairly beautiful - even at lower settings! And to me it preformed quite well, despite having a pretty old graphics card! The soundtrack stresses the atmosphere REALLY well!\n\nNow for the horror-aspects: Aside of the games brilliant and unsetteling story, the overall horror setting is well-implemented! The atmosphere on my first playthrough was so thick, strange and tense that it took me long to finish the game, being afraid to stumble into the unnamed horrors of the protagonists past... The mansion is littered with uncanny notes and (mostly!) paintings, and there ARE enemies that will haunt you at times, resulting in sudden jumpscares if you're not careful... This creates a constant feel of dread, especially on the first playthrough, making Layers of Fear a genuinely good horror game with a strong touch of "mystery"...\n\ntl;dnr?: Layers of Fear is a good horror/mystery-game with multiple endings, but it's very short if you're not frightend easily it might get repetetive if you intend to get all the archievements!","March 6","true","16.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The story is also compelling to a degree but i believe it starts to fall apart near the end which kinda ruins the entire game which is why I dont recommend buying it unless its around $10.\n\nThe game has some very obtuse mechanics that can be frustrating and they are not alluded to in game at all, you have to read guides to figure the stuff im talking about out for the most part.  The dev has been very active on the forums trying to explain this and that shouldnt be required.\n\nThe team did a stellar job getting the ball to the 5 yard line but they just couldnt cross the line which is heart breaking because i was really rooting for them.\n\nHopefully they make another game and take feedback into consideration because this team has major talent,\n\nNow my complaints about some of the scares are minor.  I played with full 7.1 surround sound not headphones so audio cues worked well but even then i missed some scares and then other scares just fell flat.  It also seems like mid game they started running out of ideas on how to freak you out.  The game had almost no tension after the first 45 min which is a true shame.\n\nI cant say I didnt enjoy alot of the title but I also cant say it met its potential which is why i say wait for a sale before you invest.  Its billed as the game PT could have been but thats just not true, not at all.\n\nIf you do buy it i suggest playing through once without help then for any further attempts you use a guide.  Sometimes I wish steam had a 3rd option instead of just yes and no because this game would fit that 3rd option.","April 9","false","14.5"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

From a lot of reviews people were making this game out to be a groundbreaking scare fest that genuinely makes you feel tense throughout. In reality a lot of it is somewhat derivative stuff from the likes of Amnesia involving fairly predictable jump scares and a fairly generic "psychotic man has murdered his wife and child HERE ARE THE IMPLICATIONS". Pretty nice visuals throughout, some of the effects like the distortion of your surroundings are quite cool.\n\nThis is just a "preview" version of the game, so you get just under 2 hours of gameplay which consists of walking around, trying doorhandles and opening drawers.

There are no puzzles to solve, just codes for safes and doors painted very plainly on the walls. Keys to pick and use in the very same room, for no reason than to briefly distract the player. Lots of drawers to open, but rarely anything worthwhile to find.\nThe notion I was sold on of exploring a constantly shifting Victorian mansion was also a letdown. The game takes advantage of the 'changing environment' trope to the point of vulgarity, and it becomes tiresome very quickly. After acquainting myself with the opening setting, everything is thrown out the window in favor of a very linear corridor-after-corridor approach, every door locked firmly behind you as you proceed. Expect to bump into reused assets through the entire game. It would have been much more effective to familiarise yourself with a set environment, and then maybe have it deteriorate/mutate halfway through the game.\nThe nature of the protagonists' quest is revealed through a series of hamfisted cluedropping, which left me saying 'get on with it!' for the rest of the game. The ending reveals what is at that time practically an open secret, and is very underwhelming.\nThe most cardinal sin here is the lack of any real danger to the player. There's a creature that shows up here and there, but evading it is as simple as going back the other way. You don't even have a reason to do that. After a brief spook, you get back on your feet and be on your merry way.  The absence of any kind of fail-state fails to induce any kind of creative or intuitive play on behalf of the player; You can go through doors and corridors right up to the end after every encounter with the creature.\nThe multiple endings seem to be built around the notion of returning to previous chapters to collect more things and evade the nasty, but just finishing the game once proved a real chore. I can't recommend this game for anyone but the thirstiest horror fan. A poor man's Amnesia.","May 18","false","4.5"," 17 of 30 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","17","30","0","1"

It's like an improved version of P.T. mixed with Gone Home.

In a lot of ways, this game reminds me of the greatest horror game that never was, Silent Hills P.T.   If I had to liken it to another game on Steam, I would compare it to Anna. Very cerebral, non-traditional horror gaming.\n\nIt gives you a very disturbing insight into the mind of a troubled, creative genius. But the story isn't simply handed to you, you gradually piece it together as you wander a maze of a house decked out with 19th century style . This game does not rely on gore or jumpscares, but rather tries to get inside your head and mess with your perceptions and really make you feel that sense of madness and dread. You wander through a seemingly endless loop, and as you helplessly search room to room, you slowly realize the house has became an entity itself rather than just a setting; a living, breathing, evolving thing.

He had (or maybe still has) a wife and a daughter, but his main focus is not the family, but his yet-to-be-completed best painting - his Magnum Opus. You delve deep into the everchanging coridors of an old mansion to finish the masterpiece and simultaneously uncover hints to the tragic story of this man's life.\n\nThe story itself is uncertain and open to speculation, since you never know the full picture, but the experience you get, while trying to salvage and put together the bits and pieces of whatever you're looking for, is truly a horror one. The studio uses a vast variety of methods to make you question every single item in each room, every single turn, door or window. The grotesque transformations deliver a unique (and overly original, compared to the other similar titles in the industry) feeling of dealing with the unknown.\n\nI found the game frightening, disturbing, building tension and stress, with a fair dose of bizzare puzzles and a fistful of classic jumpscares in the sea of horror tropes. In my opinion this piece is an exquisite horror game and should be played by fans and newcomers of the genre alike, as it sets high standards for the titles to come.

He seems to be on a mission to complete a "unique" painting from "unique" ingredients in a House which is changing every time you go between rooms.\n\nThroughout the game you will find clues as to what might have happened in this house but what ever it is something is not happy with the person you control and the fear of something looming in the next room is always present.\n\nThis game has an amazing atmosphere and the audio of dialog, footsteps, doors, objects, etc,,, is superbly done and adds to it in every way.\n\nThe jump-scares are well thought out. Not ones did I feel a jump-scare was just done for the sake of it but instead had some meaning to it that showed progress to the story or hinted at something, wanting you to find out more about it.\n\nThe things that happen in rooms with objects or the changing of rooms while you search for clues is just amazingly well done.\nRooms change seamlessly and the game is so well designed that it has you somehow look into the opposite direction when things change, resulting in the "WTF" moments more often than not when you turn back around.\n\nThe story so far has been deeply intriguing, making you continuously wanting to find out more and questioning your own thoughts on what happened more than just a few times.\n\nI don't know what it is but the developers have the mixture of things down to such a fine art that everything just flows together so well it is hard to believe this game is only in Early Access.\n\nWhat ever it is you are doing guys, keep on doing it :)\n\nThis Game ticked all the right boxes for me and I can't wait to play it again ones it is completed.\n\nIf you want to see the Early Access playthrough feel free to check it out below.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2qWF6Nea1Q&list=PLpd5HpREizQ1GX5n1pfFr3fybEtR13oT1&index=1","September 14, 2015","true","3.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

If you on the other hand replays the game, you can go to some parts of the game and choose a different door and explore new areas.

So if you are a lover of horror, and searching for a unique horror game that gives you a atmospheric experience that you never has seen before, then you definitely need to give this game a shot, since this is a true masterpiece.\n\nHere is a demo:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rwu_cP1Z3D4","August 30, 2015","true","6.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

Jumpscares and less-than-stellar stories have ruined the genre for me, but Layers of Fear looked interesting and had good reviews. Merited at least me trying and, if it was terrible, returning.\n\nLet me tell you how glad I am that I bought this. I purchased back when it was just released into Early Access and it was superb. There wasn't the full story or the full game, but there was enough to get me very interested.\n\nFor starters, let's talk about how it compares to other games in the genre. I recently played SOMA and found this one to be much better; while there was nothing literally hunting you down, there was still a sense of urgency when the wife is around. You know she isn't here to hug you. Layers of Fear also has better level design in the sense of not giving you real safe areas to backtrack to; for the most part, you enter a new room and you're stuck there until you progress.\n\nThe story is really good too.

This game is a rare breed cast out among the denizens of horror games that are created. It's possibly one of the best ones I've ever played.\n\nIt's a story you experience rather than a game you "play". I loved the game, and I think it's a fantastic start to a foundation that seems set to deliver a certain experience rather than a free flowing run-away and survive type game. So, if you are looking for an Outlast type game, this isn't your game.\n\nThe story is good, and that's what makes this kind of thing okay. I would harp on the gameplay if the story sucked, but it's well put together, has narrative action, and displays a unique sense of regret from the protagonist. It's not just a go here and you will see what happened type game.\n\nIt, is all, just a delve into the psyche, where death is not something that is particularly an end to a means. Going crazy? Yes, definitely possible. But Death is just something that wouldn't happen in a game like this, where you are traipsing through the mind of a sycophant, rather than through an actual haunted house.\n\nThe jump scares were seldom, so you'd never know when to expect them. The only flaw with the game was optimization of the graphics; I was getting random frame skips on a Titan X, but they were extremely rare, so it's not that big of a deal.\n\nI highly recommend this.\n\nUPDATE: They seem to have fixed the stutter problems, so it runs as smooth as a peach now.","September 10, 2015","true","4.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This game is no Amnesia clone like most horror games are nowadays, but something completely different. And it really works.\n\nInstead of facing the traditional monsters, the danger is that you're trapped in your own mind. The game offers a very plausble view of what it would be like to be insane, and sooner or later you'll find that you accept all the impossible things that you witness. It's almost like a batshit simulator.\n\nThe game does use jump scares, a fair few even, but they're not actually meant to startle you, they're more there to keep you on the edge of your seat. The constantly shifting environment the player finds himself in is actually way more unsettling because you never know what's going to happen, anything at all is possible. The realisation that anything could happen at any time is what drives the suspense here, and it works brilliantly.\n\nThe way this all ties together is how in this game the environment can change when you're not looking. Drastically. As you can't see everything at the same time, you're always vulnerable to the things that are just outside the corner of your eye. Trying to keep things in your vision makes you inevitably turn your back on something else. Nowhere is safe, and that's what the game expertly impresses on you. Just like a truly insane person.\n\nAnother thing that has to be said is the visuals. The textures are razor sharp and the models are very nice. The best thing is the artwork in this game though. Who made all this? Even if you're not a fan of the gameplay, the paintings themselves are quite beautifully made. Expert work here.\n\nHighly recommended for any fans of the horror genre. While still in development and not the scariest game I've ever played, it's definitely among the most elegant.","November 15, 2015","true","7.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The whole thing has this whole "Oscar Wilde and MC Escher get thrown in a tumble dryer with HP Lovecraft," asthetic.

And I don't mean that the game has bugs that cripple it, that's to be expected with Early Access.  It's why I generally avoid them like the plague.\n\nBut, with that said...  I watched some videos, read some reviews and figured I'd give it a shot.  It's only a fiver atm after all right?\n\nBut no, the game is literally, not finished.  I got a part way through the fourth part (don't want to say anymore as I don't want to spoil it) and it just stopped and said 'Thanks for playing, hope you enjoy more later'.  I at least come to expect the main part of the story to be in the game when you're paying money for it!  So, to me, this is a major point of concern.  If the dev's now decide to say sod it, I'm never going to know the ending.  That, my friends, would be unforgivable.\n\nBut, with that said, I am going to risk giving this a thumbs up.  Why?  Because it's cheap.  I played near 3.5 hours investigating things and at times, my heart was pounding and I 'wanted' to know where the story was going.  I have my suspicions, as we all probably do, but I want to see it there, done and dusted right in front of me.  So, for this reason I would say it's worth a £5 one off payment.  Besides, it's only 90 minutes off my normal £1/hour preferred rate, so can't really complain there either.\n\nJust keep in mind, there are some bugs (had a draw in the bedroom move into the chest-of-drawers itself when I moved) and the game isn't yet complete.  But if you're a fan of psychological horror that's not just 'run and hide until it goes away', definitely take a look.","August 28, 2015","true","3.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This game is a rare breed cast out among the denizens of horror games that are created. It's possibly one of the best ones I've ever played.\n\nIt's a story you experience rather than a game you "play". I loved the game, and I think it's a fantastic start to a foundation that seems set to deliver a certain experience rather than a free flowing run-away and survive type game. So, if you are looking for an Outlast type game, this isn't your game.\n\nThe story is good, and that's what makes this kind of thing okay. I would harp on the gameplay if the story sucked, but it's well put together, has narrative action, and displays a unique sense of regret from the protagonist. It's not just a go here and you will see what happened type game.\n\nIt, is all, just a delve into the psyche, where death is not something that is particularly an end to a means. Going crazy? Yes, definitely possible. But Death is just something that wouldn't happen in a game like this, where you are traipsing through the mind of a sycophant, rather than through an actual haunted house.\n\nThe jump scares were seldom, so you'd never know when to expect them. The only flaw with the game was optimization of the graphics; I was getting random frame skips on a Titan X, but they were extremely rare, so it's not that big of a deal.\n\nI highly recommend this.\n\nUPDATE: They seem to have fixed the stutter problems, so it runs as smooth as a peach now.","September 10, 2015","true","4.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You may not either agree with my opinion or have the same experience I had with my gameplay.\n\nThis is a long review so get comfortable.\n\nSo I bought this game, last year, the day after its early-access release. The full game came out, only a few days ago, and I have to say that I'm utterly amazed.\n\nSince the full release, the developers have added far new content, completed the story (obviously), added scares and even improved scares. The story behind it, if you pay close attention, is fascinating and the ending (if you get what it means) is shocking.\n\nThe story - 8/10\n\nOf course, this being a horror game, it does have scares (duh). However, most modern day horror games don't really put that much effort, imagination or skill into their scares, it's litterly just some thing that jumps at the screen and makes you wet yourself a little, but only scares you for that brief few seconds. Unlike these games, this little gem scares you in a different way. This game not only scares you, but completely ♥♥♥♥s with your mind, thanks to its unsettling music and creepy atmosphere. This game does use jumpscares, but uses them discreetly. It doesn't do it every few minutes or seconds like 'Five Nights at Freddy's'.\n\nThe scares - 10/10 (for being the most clever in-game scares I've ever come across)\n\nFinally, there's the atmosphere. I was completely immersed in the atmosphere of this game. One of the things that helped with my immersion was there being no loading screens at all. The game 'Outlast' did this also, creating an immersive and realistic world. The visuals are one of the best I've seen in an Indie game, both textures and post-processing. The lighting was pretty-much accurate and the textures looked pretty. Of course there was the music. The music completely immersed me into the game, giving me the feeling that I shouldn't be there or something isn't right (well, it is a horror game of course).\n\nImmersion/atmosphere - 9.5/10\n\nI conclusion, if it wasn't obvious enough, I absolutely love this game. It uses great visuals, music, scares, atmosphere and story. Pretty much everything that makes a good horror game.\n\nSo, my final rating for the game has to be - 9.7/10\n\nThe developers got almost everything right (but hey, no game is perfect). As much as this is my favorite horror game so far, they could have made the story a little more obvious to new players. When I first got the game last year, I was kind of clueless about the story when I first played it. After playing it another time, I started to get it, but I guess that's just me. Anyway, I think Bloober Team did an amazing job with this game and I hope to see more games from them in the future.\n\nIf you have a spare fifteen quid in your wallet, I reccommend that you definetly give this a try in your spare time, preferably at night (for immersion of course).","August 29, 2015","true","16.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ram8113/recommended/391720/","ram8113","Usmovers_02","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ram8113/","433 products in account","Incredible horror experience :D Loved every minute of it! I've been playing this game since it went on Early Access and have now played the full version beginning to end.\n\n\nGRAPHICS\n\nAbsolutely superb. Brilliant use of lighting and shadows. Simply put some of the best interior graphics I've seen, perhaps only beaten by the legendary P.T.\n\nHowever playing with a triple screen set up (5760x1080) isn't perfect. For one getting close to walls with 3 screens causes the camera but not the player to clip through. This does not happen with traditional resolutions.\n\nAlso with 3 screens microstuttering is a serious issue and the game can't hit 60 FPS (Intel Core i7 4790K, GTX 980 Ti, 8 GB RAM). It hovers in the 45-50 FPS range but feels like 15 because of the stuttering. Again, not at all an issue at normal resolutions. Microstuttering remains an issue in the full release as well even at 1920x1080.\n\n\nSOUND\n\nMostly good, very rarely rather bad, often exceptional but honestly 95% of the time it's just generic horror game type sounds. Lots of sudden loud sounds used for jump scares. However there are maybe 4 or 5 sound effects that really sounded bad to me. Fortunately they're quick and non-looping sounds. The music is exceptional and sets the mood brilliantly. They actually do some really cool stuff with music in the game.\n\n\nCONTROLS\n\nThey do the job well but are a bit erratic. You'll be looking around steadily then suddenly it accelerates really fast. It's really not that bad but these are not CoD or Halo controls. Also it's not uncommon to get stuck on small objects.\n\n\nSCARES\n\nA nearly even mix of psychological and jump scares... and man are there a LOT of both! This isn't your traditional horror game where you'll have to wait an hour or two for the scares to start. It's pretty much right off the bat with Layers of Fear. There's plenty of really messed up imagry that works REALLY well. There's also a lot of jump scares that are surprisingly well crafted given how common they are in this game. Even at the very end the jumps feel fresh and unexpected.\n\nRegrattably I don't get that sense of dread I get with games like P.T. and Amnesia. Layers of Fear is more like a very colorful and really bad acid trip. Also, while creepy (monster spoilers ahead) the ghost feels like a direct copy and paste of Lisa from P.T. in both the way she looks and moves and in the way she kills you but with naked boobies (I seem to recall reading that this was deliberate but I'm not sure)\n\nOne problem that I had with the game prerelease was that the scares were just packed WAY too close together. This has been mostly fixed but not completely. Particularly towards the end it feels like the scares are happening one right after the other diminishing the effect.\n\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nThere really isn't any. There are some relatively simple yet clever puzzles and a few scavenger hunts but that's it. There's no combat, no hiding, no inventory ect. This game is definitely a "walking simulator" but damn is it a good one!\n\n\nSTORY\n\nDecent. It's told almost completely through hidden and optional newspaper clippings and notes so what you get out of the story depends on how much you like to explore and read. If you DO take your time and look around I thought the characters were very interesting. The story isn't going to blow you away but I did find that I wanted to know what happened and the story definitely added to the messed up mood the game is going for.\n\n\nREPLAY VALUE\n\nLimited however this game is just PACKED with detail. Even more detail than P.T. It's the type of game where you will definitely notice something different each time you play. I played through each of the prerelease versions multiple times and it always felt fresh even though it was the same. And with the full release they've added a TON more content. There's also quite a bit of notes, newspaper clippings and drawings to find.\n\n\nWHO IS THIS GAME FOR?\n\nFor: P.T, Amnesia, SOMA, Paranormal Activity, Blair Witch, Haunted House fans.\n\nNOT for: Dead Space, Walking Dead, Alien Isolation, Slasher, Action fans.\n\n\nRECAP\n\nDefinitely loved going through this and will do so again... and again and again and again! There are better, more complete horror games out there such as P.T, Amnesia: The Dark Descent and SOMA but this game is miles ahead of most AAA "horror" action games and quite a few steps above most of the indie offerings on Steam. 4.5/10 An absolute masterpiece and a must have for fans of less actiony horror games.","September 30, 2015","true","15.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The emersive supernatural/psychological horror atmosphere of PT and the absolutely terrifying environment and puzzles (find the key to the door etc) of Amnesia.

We absolutely need more games of this caliber and type in the horror genre.\n\nWith that said there are a few low points in the overall game experience, mostly towards the end of the preview/beta. Without spoiling anything I'd say that the devs need to take the "less is more" approach in regards to a particular character.\n\nYou see the character way too many times, and seeing the character model up-close completely took me out of the experience.\n\nThere are also pacing problems towards the end of the preview. There's very little breathing room between jump-scares, hallucinations, etc.\n\nI'm still very much looking forward to the release and more content.","January 10","true","1.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You may not either agree with my opinion or have the same experience I had with my gameplay.\n\nThis is a long review so get comfortable.\n\nSo I bought this game, last year, the day after its early-access release. The full game came out, only a few days ago, and I have to say that I'm utterly amazed.\n\nSince the full release, the developers have added far new content, completed the story (obviously), added scares and even improved scares. The story behind it, if you pay close attention, is fascinating and the ending (if you get what it means) is shocking.\n\nThe story - 8/10\n\nOf course, this being a horror game, it does have scares (duh). However, most modern day horror games don't really put that much effort, imagination or skill into their scares, it's litterly just some thing that jumps at the screen and makes you wet yourself a little, but only scares you for that brief few seconds. Unlike these games, this little gem scares you in a different way. This game not only scares you, but completely ♥♥♥♥s with your mind, thanks to its unsettling music and creepy atmosphere. This game does use jumpscares, but uses them discreetly. It doesn't do it every few minutes or seconds like 'Five Nights at Freddy's'.\n\nThe scares - 10/10 (for being the most clever in-game scares I've ever come across)\n\nFinally, there's the atmosphere. I was completely immersed in the atmosphere of this game. One of the things that helped with my immersion was there being no loading screens at all. The game 'Outlast' did this also, creating an immersive and realistic world. The visuals are one of the best I've seen in an Indie game, both textures and post-processing. The lighting was pretty-much accurate and the textures looked pretty. Of course there was the music. The music completely immersed me into the game, giving me the feeling that I shouldn't be there or something isn't right (well, it is a horror game of course).\n\nImmersion/atmosphere - 9.5/10\n\nI conclusion, if it wasn't obvious enough, I absolutely love this game. It uses great visuals, music, scares, atmosphere and story. Pretty much everything that makes a good horror game.\n\nSo, my final rating for the game has to be - 9.7/10\n\nThe developers got almost everything right (but hey, no game is perfect). As much as this is my favorite horror game so far, they could have made the story a little more obvious to new players. When I first got the game last year, I was kind of clueless about the story when I first played it. After playing it another time, I started to get it, but I guess that's just me. Anyway, I think Bloober Team did an amazing job with this game and I hope to see more games from them in the future.\n\nIf you have a spare fifteen quid in your wallet, I reccommend that you definetly give this a try in your spare time, preferably at night (for immersion of course).","August 29, 2015","true","16.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Along with Outlast and Amnesia. While the game does have some jump scares, they mostly rely on reality twisting events such as all the furniture starting to float, or weird dolls shaking uncontrollably. There was even one instance where i paiting started "talking behind my back" and once I turned around to look at it, it went back to normal.\n\nLong story short, don't expect jump scares every where you turn, and dont expect it to be a mindless horror game where theres no story whatsoever. The story is interesting, and keeps me playing. If you enjoy psychological horror games that will screw with your mind this is a must have.\n\n\n\nEDIT: Turns out I was already pretty close to finishing the game, so its pretty short, but extremely enjoyable. I plan on playing through again to unlock all of the secrets.","February 18","true","7.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dieselpoweredfurry/recommended/391720/","dieselpoweredfurry","pengo the otter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dieselpoweredfurry/","147 products in account","OK KIDS!  TIME FOR A PENGO GAME REVIEW OF A HORROR GAME YOU PROBABLY WON'T PLAY BECAUSE OF IT'S CONTENT!!! *game show bells*  First off, i've played through the first Amnesia game enough times to do it asleep and hands tied, so i'm not new to intensive fear games, but this one opens up a new jar of whoop-♥♥♥ on you I can ASSURE YOU , you are NOT ready for no matter who you are.  Second off, these doors in this game need a little fixing, I spend most of my time thinking I turned the knob and just running face first into it like a dummy.  Other wise all other interactions in the game worked A-OK!  Now, as for it's content, my brain is just fried after playing it.  It makes you scared of every decision you make like, "oh you WANT to open that drawer do you hmmm? ok dooooood".  Then there's the mechanic of it's ever changing envrionment, eventhough you KNOW it changes, you still keep asking "what changed...what changed.........what changed" you become OBSESSED.  They also have little humor thrown in here and there to kind of reality check yourself to keep you in reality or just kind of reward you for making it through a moment they toss at you. A nice touch.\n\nThere isn't much for actual MUSIC to talk about other than, don't worry, it fits in perfectly with the COREECT sound everytime when it's needed, don't sweat it.  As for ambient noise and other sounds all i can say is this *two thumbs up*   That guy is a savant and has some new sounds ive just never heard before from a sound designer in a horror game.  Graphically it's stunning.  I had it maxed out and my R9 280x wasn't even sweating it, they do an amazing job with the lighting and coloring.  They make you see what they want you to see, and sometimes make you see what shouldn't be seen, but they just kinda leave it there because you know....go ahead....look at it, see what happens pal.   But seriously, the gameplay was very smooth, no lag, you could go start to finish and it's smooth sailing, it never struggled, there's no load screens its all one big movement, one big stage.  The controls are also so basic, they aren't even anything near a problem (except the doors COME ON GUYS!!  sorry the doors really bugged me  :x anyways...where was I...)\n\nVery briefly and NON SPOILER (have no fear...get it...ugh ok..) the story was the most horrificly mind bending writing i've seen in a while.  There's so much to pay attention to and so much to remember BUT AT THE SAME TIME, it's nothing long term like "oh remember this and that for this later".  The game is split into chapters (DONT WORRY NO SPOILERINOS KIDS),  so it takes each thing to pay attention to a step at a time and no further than that.  So it gives you a lot to think about, but in chunks, right?  I'd say job well done there.  It just means you can easily pick up the game at any chapter and not so much not miss anything, but experience a certain part of the story without needing to much prior knowledge.  You still need SOME just because that's how it is, but it's not CRITICAL persay for entertainments sake, get what i'm saying?  Good.\n\nAlright to wrap up this bull ♥♥♥♥,  i've been paying attention to this game since i saw a video playthrough of a demo roughly a year ago, and was excited to see a final version come out, I just had to play it, had to do it.  All-in-all its a game that will seriously (and I MEAN it) test your mental stability in your decisions.  It's also a game that comes right up and says, "hello!  I hate you!  So take this!! *scare*"  The scares are a good split of about 30% just pure jump scares to 70% of them actually being YOUR fault for bringing them upon your self.  It challenges you to play the game in such a way that makes you connect with the main character a bit more as it goes on, and you kind of understand what they are trying to tell you in the story.  I may be cryptic in all this but i'd still rather be vague in my review of actual content and more clear on its gameplay and structure that way I can tell you that it's a well-made game, go check it out yourself or watch a playthrough of someone who is very thorough if you can't manage to play it yourself.\n\nThe final verdict on Layers of Fear (bearing in mind after one full playthrough) --- A very solid 8/10.  Bravo, minor improvements in small places but nonetheless,  well worth the cost of admission.","February 17","true","7.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The detail in the environment is top notch and the graphics are great.  Despite the haunting environment, the mansion is beautiful.  One thing I like is the area changes as you walk through the house (think of the Stanley Parable).  Sometimes just turning around will change the room!  They did a great job with the environment changes and jump scares.  Because the doors and hallways change and the jump scares are so surprising it adds to the scare factor and makes the game less predictable.  From what I've gathered, I think you're seeing stuff through the eyes of a crazy artist and/or the house is haunted.  Either way it's scary!\n\nPros\nGreat horror game.\nSimple controls.\nUnpredictable - changing environment.\nGraphics and detail.\nVoice acting.\nYou can explore - cabinets, drawers, find items, etc.\nStoryline - there isn't a huge story to this but just enough to make it interesting.

Was planning to wait, sleep, and stream it later today. But heck - once I tested out the opening scene I had to finish it.\n\nEnds out the story is rather complex and requires the pieces to fit in order to fully understand. Without giving away too much spoiler - I'd assume the game is a run down of the mental anguish the artist endures with each painting. Even if he captures a lost beauty in each painting he can not recreate anything as good as what he lost. Given what I found at the end in the kitchen, and the letter in the desk of the office, along with the items you collect throughout the game trying to recreate that beauty lost to a perfection. I assume he needed a sample of the original to attempt painting it from more than just memory.\n\nThe story reminds me of Exmortis. Graphics similar to Silent Hill. Jump scares of Dead Space 2. And some scenes either FEAR 2 or Among the Sleep.\n\nEither way - This is the long awaited game I desired ever since Slender New Arrival was too short and easily completed with minimal effort. Great job overall. Left the story do be decided by the player based around clues uncovered along the way.","February 17","true","9.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

I myself crashed 4 times trying to boot it up but after tweaking it works flawlessly.\n\nThe game is absolutely drenched in atmospheric horror that is similar to games like Amnesia and P.T.  During the parts I played (even with my friend making jokes with me) we still were absolutely terrified without even the tiniest of jumpscares. The game genuinely makes you terrified by going up the stairs. Let me repeat this, the game makes you scared about GOING UP THE STAIRS. I only played 44 minutes of it in total and I was still absolutely terrified. The game’s added beautiful graphics adds a more realistic level of fear as well, you really feel like you are this person roaming the halls of this abandoned house. In short, I was wonderfully immersed in one of the best horror games in a while.\n\nThanks to John Turner (TheBrokenKeyboard) for helping me survive this game and this review","August 27, 2015","true","4.8"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

There are jump scares that actually work (make sure to have headphones on obviously at a good volume for the best effect)\n\nOverall this is a very polished game already to say it's in early access, it could do with some further optimization though but I'm sure that will come with time (and further patches/updates)\n\nWell done Developers, you've got a good game on your hands here, I look forward to seeing it develop even more so.","August 28, 2015","true","5.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","2"

Spacial relationships become irrelevent, as you walk repeatedly down similar corridors.

The fact is that you could play the chapters of this game in any order, because its just a sequence of events with little inevitability linking them together. There is some great art direction and atmosphere in this game, but it feels squandered because... well... I never really cared where I was in the story...

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/uncageable/recommended/391720/","uncageable","Gwidhw","http://steamcommunity.com/id/uncageable/","679 products in account","[UPDATED BASED ON FINAL RELEASE]\n\nLayers of Fear is an intense, emotional horror game with a very interesting and disturbing story.\n\n=======\n\nCONS:\n\n- Game crashing: I am consistently having issues relating to this game crashing. Only with this game, am I having the issue where my "Display driver has failed and been reset successfully" or some such thing. It renders the game unplayable (AMD Radeon HD). I have been able to make it work, however, by launching it via the "Radeon Settings" panel, but, it still crashes every now and then, though not as often as it did when launched directly through Steam. Could it be due to optimization of some sort..? I'm not an expert; I wouldn't know.\n\n\nNEUTRAL:\n\n+/- The deed: I would have liked a better, more slowly revealed fleshing out of what he has done, as it is made more than obvious from the first "item" found. A slow reveal, leading up to a shocking "ermagerd!" moment would have been grand, but, I can also appreciate why they chose this line of progression. I just wish they had found a way to make it more shocking. Although, the way it is leaves a lasting feeling of unease, and discomfort. Well done, overall, but my preference puts this in "neutral" ground for me.\n\n\nPROS:\n\n+ The Voice-acting/line-reading: It's very well suited to the character and gives a deranged, yet sophisticated feel to his presence. There isn't a constant nattering in your ear, nor is there a lack of dialogue. It's placed perfectly, and fits the game atmosphere appropriately. Well done~\n\n+ The Atmosphere: Brilliant. The game has a haunting and unsettling vibe to it, yet still maintains an air of sophistication, albiet one that seems to have been a fall from grace, for lack of better words. It really "paints a picture" of what went on in that house, and is going on in the mind of the Artist himself.\n\n+ The Graphics: They look amazing. Great job. In both "Low" and "High" settings, the game looks fantastic. I have to play this in "low" settings to ensure that the game doesn't randomly crash (seems to help?), but, it looks great :)\n\n+ The Story: Both intriguing and disturbing, this game really makes you want to continue to find out what went on in the household, and what is still occuring within the mind of the Artist. You're unnerved, but you want to know what he did in its entirety. Very good momentum.\n\n+ The In-game Artwork: As an artist myself, and a fan of this style, I am in love with the art chosen for this game. It's just... mesmerizing :)\n\n+ The Soundtrack: Spot on. Good choice. If this was composed by someone on the Dev's "team", then they should get an A+. If it was 3rd party, well, great choice regardless :)\n\n+ Early Access->Final Product: The changes made since Early Access were grand. I expected the game to be similar to the "Early Access" version that I played through, but, upon playing the Final Version, I found it was tweaked perfectly, with more revisions and better inclusions. Certain points in the progression have been changed, for the better, and repetition of certain events has been cut drastically. Tres bien~ :)\n\n\n=======\n\nDo I recommend?\nABSOLUTELY.\n\nIf you're a fan of horror games, whether jump-scare or psychological, this game will appeal to you.  If you're a fan of mystery games, artwork, and narratives, well, this will appeal to you (more of a visual narrative).\n\nIf you don't like any of the above, well... you're missing out, you pansy~ xF\n\n10/10 would play again.\nKeeping installed so as to revel in it's beauty, again, at a later date~","August 31, 2015","true","5.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

While some of the scares become a bit predictable, and some stereotypical, that does not mean they don't work. Frpm the creature banging on the window to me calling scare and then being absolutely horrified by it. The only fault I can probably give this game is that, at one point, a bug happened where I couldn't open a cabinet to look at a mission item I had found.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mouthyb/recommended/391720/","mouthyb","wormwood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mouthyb/","286 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThe Good:\n\n--This is a publishing company that knows its horror, and knows enough about horror to know that the scary ♥♥♥♥ is not monsters, it's what humans are willing to do to themselves and others.\n\n--This is also a publishing company that understands the use of symbolism, which is what distinguishes the individuals who really "get" horror and people who throw gore around like a food fight in Hell's cafeteria.\n\n--If you're an art and horror buff like me, the game is stuffed full of completely sensical allusions to classical art, to the artistic process, and to the kind of person many of the old Masters happened to be.\n\n--The spare set design allowed them to reuse scenes over and over, with slight changes, in a way that never gets old and actually enhances the experience of the game.\n\n--I have never been so strongly reminded of the actual process of painting (yes, I actually paint.) The game was incredibly full of insider references and experiences native to being a working artist. It's amazing to get the chance to see video games embrace the arts and the fact that video games are a form of art.\n\nThe Bad:\n\n--The plot was a bundle of seriously recycled horror themes. It's easy to lose track of this in how beautiful the game is, but don't go in expecting anything new in terms of horror. I saw the plot coming by chapter two. In some ways, this means that the foreshadowing in the game was working exactly as it should have been. However, it ruined the scare factor for me entirely. I spent the first three chapters giggling at the effects.\n\nOn second thought, that worries me a little. May need to gargle holy water.\n\nThe Ugly:\n\n--One playthrough took me two hours, including the time I spent playing the Halloween special. I bought this game, and the end thanked me for playing the "sample" game. Perhaps that's just a bit of code that should have come out, but between the really damn short play time and the message at the end of the game, I'm a little.... meh about it. I am aware that it was intended to be short (I browse forums before buying), but two hours is pretty damn short.\n\nI'm willing to recommend it because the visuals and a few of the not-quite puzzles are just that damn good.\n\nThe best value for this game lies in thinking of it as an interactive horror movie. That's pretty much exactly what it is.\n\nedited to add: Yes, I'm aware this is an EA game. However, I can't review what I can't play.","November 1, 2015","true","3.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The house feels very lived in and believable, the narrative is presented wonderfully, and the audio will leave you wondering "What the hell is making that sound?" The game left me feeling like the idiotic lead in many a horror film that constantly walks towards danger in order to feed their curiousity only to find themselves scared and feeling vulnerable.\n\nIt's the perfect haunted house game and if you're looking for some good scares you won't go wrong with Layers of Fear.","August 30, 2015","true","4.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

On-edge and tense were the only emotions I felt while playing it, and the tension keeps building and then, at that moment, your most vulnerable state, is when the game strikes. There is a stage where I just can't get past because, well, I’m genuinely scared and couldn't stop looking behind my chair to see if there's something or someone there. Not many games ever make me feel this scared, and when the jump scares come, every part of your body is stimulated and a shock is induced through your core that leaves you f**ked up.\n\nAtmospheric, enjoyable, horrifying, tense and genuinely intelligent this game pieces together emotions and recreates classic works of art and mixes generically clever horror to craft an entirely new perspective… one we may never have thought the artists or ourselves might’ve had.\n\nIf you’re an adrenaline junky; put your headphones on, turn off the lights and mentally prepare yourself to literally crap your pants and sob like a little bi**h.\n","September 21, 2015","true","4.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Despite this, Layers of Fear did a fantastic job of genuinely creeping me out. It has 1 or 2 jump scares you can see coming from a mile away but honestly the main attraction here is the fantastic attention to atmosphere, which is arguably the most important aspect of a truly scary horror game.\n\nThe game is very subdued and subtle at first but as the game progresses it becomes more and more unhinged, the environments and atmosphere transitioning from unnerving to outright disturbing. This game is very "passive" and you spend most of your time walking around looking at things  but it does a fantastic job of keeping you on your toes and wondering what's coming next.\n\nIf you've played Silent Hill games you're definitely going to notice the subtle homages here and there. I caught quite a few references to SH4 and at least one for SH2...\n\nOverall I highly recommend it to anyone who wants a horror game that focuses less on monsters jumping out of closets and more on making you dread what's around the next corner,\n\nNow for some criticism: The game feels a bit too predictable and linear in its current state. After playing it through once I really don't have much incentive to do it again because I already know everything that's going to happen and the order in which it happens. That's not a problem right now since it's just an early access game, but in the full version it would be great if it were more unpredictable or if it were possible to do things in a different order.","September 25, 2015","true","1.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The ways the rooms morph before my eyes really ♥♥♥♥ed me up, as well as the tense buildup to jumpscares. I'm not really a fan of jumpscares becasue I usually think they're cheap, but these didn't really seem cheap to me.  Your character has schizophrenia,  so turning around to see something that wasn't there before doesn't seem unneccesary, it just feels like it's part of the story and part of your character.

Although it's not 100% complete I'd say it's right on track with the early Silent Hill games, Amnesia, Penumbra, and the like.\n\nGood:\n-Graphics, art design, visual effects, and use of sound are all outstanding.\n-The game does a terrific job of focusing your attention on certain things and using that to scare you.\n-Perhaps the game's greatest strength is how seamless the room transitions are. I won't spoil any more than that.\n-Very happy that this game was created using Unity, an amazing free to use engine.\n-Amazing that just about all of the creepy artworks are from real life.\n-An interesting narrative that will hopefully have a twist or a revelation in the end, it doesn't overwhelm the player with too much info so that's good too.\n\nBad:\n-It's still early access, so it's not done. I played through it in about 2 hours.\n-My fairly new computer was pushed to the limit on this one, there might be some optimization issues that still need to be addressed. The framerate was somewhat choppy throughout but not so bad that I couldn't enjoy it or stream it for others.\n\nIf you have any interest in scaring yourself or others I highly recommend that you buy the Early Access version of the game to support the developers, turn the lights off and prepare to soil yourself.

And I have never played one with an approach like this. I lost track of whether I'd had one drink too many or the game was getting crazier!\n\nMy only criticism would be that although this is purely a psychological horror, the gameplay is a little linear in that there is very minimal wayfinding/puzzle solving which could lead to boredom in the long term with the game's interactive aspect. But if like me you're starved of a quality twisted horror experience, by all means give this a try and contribute to it's development.

Even though this is in early alpha, the flaws barely hinder the gameplay and atmosphere of this amazing experience. I was playing with a friend, and after every critical event, we would agree on how incredible this game is.\n\nThe game has a great pace. You  always wonder what is around the corner as it constantly puts you into new enviroments. There is a great blend of lore and horror as you wonder which belongs in each room. You'll find that the lore keeps you intrigued enough to continue into even the most obvious of bad decisions.\n\nPT has been related to this game and I'm not suprised. The scenery and atmosphere is similar, but the lore is much more potent in Layers of Fear. Lets not forget that PT was a demo to a game that is now cancelled and so this is now the best shot at a full experience to what "Silent Hills" could have offered. This is potentially a one of a kind title that could change the way horror games are experienced and approached for a long time.","August 28, 2015","true","4.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is not a bad thing, I personally loved the trailer and love the direction of this game.  As of right now this game is not finished quite finished (or I must have done something really wrong) but it is still only Early Access at the moment so don't be dissapointed at its super quick ending.\nThis game does a wonderful job at molding an atmosphere for a horror game, albeit quite a few of the scares were extremely predictable.  Which most horror is to begin with so its a meh thing to me.  Also this may be simply because it is still Early Access but the movement is slight yanky and doesn't feel very fluid, too many times it would take quite a bit of time to just get my guy to face a drawer just right to open it.  Some of the rooms are very well done, (Baby room was probably my favorite) and yet some felt really bland (Room with 3 Paintings.)\n\nAlso *Spoiler?* the Zombie/Ghost/Woman attacks were way too predictable every time, and the animation felt like it was rather forced (I feel like its probably because it seemed to drag on longer than what was necessary) and is the exact same animation sequence every time. *Spoiler End*\n\nAll in all a fantastic horror that is going in a fantastic direction, and in my opinion how a horror game should be, it succeeds in creating a beautiful atmosphere that has the potential to send chills down your spine.  However a game that does have such limited actual gameplay more attention should be put into the details of this beautiful work of art to really make it shine.","August 28, 2015","true","1.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The artwork chosen works beautifully with the setting and story, and the music creates a beautifully sorrowful ambiance, with the exception of one odd adddition that conflicts with the rest of the soundtrack. However, while the level design and attention to detail create the feeling of life and history in the house, the dialogue and voice acting fall a bit flat, leading to an inconsistent character rather than a complex one. This issue tends to leave the story a bit confused, uncertain of what kind it wants to be. Despite this, the story was still interesting and I'm looking forward to the playing through the finished product. As a horror game, Layers of Fear wasn't quite as scary as its title would merit, but it is an interesting experience nonetheless, and is worth playing, especially for fans of gothic horror.","August 29, 2015","true","4.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

What I really like about this game is that you can take the time to appreciate the enviorment, and that the game does not rely on creating a monster, or jamming some sort of ghost into your face in virtually every moment that it can. In this respect the game excels.\n\nWith that being said, however, the game does not really have the best interaction with its enviroment. The enviroment is exellent, but in my playthrough it was mostly there for show. so there could be improvements with the interaction and thinking. The storytelling is absolutely amazing, yet interaction and thinking is not quite there. The game could improve with some more puzzle mechanics, or at least some more interaction with the enviroment to make the player think and at the same time allow them to enjoy the atmosphere while playing the game. Another thing that could be improved is more erractic gameplay. By this I mean more unpredictable motions. I was reading a few other reviews, and something that I could agree on was some predictability (Picking up object = Door slamming shut). This is a difficult one for most games due to the player being on edge and prepared about 90-95% of the time throughout a horror game. The trick, however, is to manage to pin down that 10-5% where the player is not expecting something to appear. There are a few points in the game that really got me, but if you managed to add even a little more of the unexpected and erratic moments, than this could become an incredibly enjoyable game. However, if you do make these changes its crucial not to take away from the enviroment or storytelling. Those two factors alone make this game a real gem in my opinion.\n\nOverall, I really did enjoy playing this game. The atmosphere, psychedelic factor and storytelling, as stated above, really makes this game stand out from the crowd. Yes, there are a few things that could be improved, but its honestly worth the 10$ (or 8$ from the sale) and more (once the game leaves early access).\n\nfor those who found this review to be TL:DR, than here:\nPros:\nAtmosphere\nPsychedelic Horror aspect\nStorytelling\n\nCons:\nInteraction with enviroment\n(Some) Predictable Moments\n\nVerdict: Positive","August 29, 2015","true","1.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

On-edge and tense were the only emotions I felt while playing it, and the tension keeps building and then, at that moment, your most vulnerable state, is when the game strikes. There is a stage where I just can't get past because, well, I’m genuinely scared and couldn't stop looking behind my chair to see if there's something or someone there. Not many games ever make me feel this scared, and when the jump scares come, every part of your body is stimulated and a shock is induced through your core that leaves you f**ked up.\n\nAtmospheric, enjoyable, horrifying, tense and genuinely intelligent this game pieces together emotions and recreates classic works of art and mixes generically clever horror to craft an entirely new perspective… one we may never have thought the artists or ourselves might’ve had.\n\nIf you’re an adrenaline junky; put your headphones on, turn off the lights and mentally prepare yourself to literally crap your pants and sob like a little bi**h.\n","September 21, 2015","true","4.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Despite this, Layers of Fear did a fantastic job of genuinely creeping me out.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/uncageable/recommended/391720/","uncageable","Gwidhw","http://steamcommunity.com/id/uncageable/","679 products in account","[UPDATED BASED ON FINAL RELEASE]\n\nLayers of Fear is an intense, emotional horror game with a very interesting and disturbing story.\n\n=======\n\nCONS:\n\n- Game crashing: I am consistently having issues relating to this game crashing. Only with this game, am I having the issue where my "Display driver has failed and been reset successfully" or some such thing. It renders the game unplayable (AMD Radeon HD). I have been able to make it work, however, by launching it via the "Radeon Settings" panel, but, it still crashes every now and then, though not as often as it did when launched directly through Steam. Could it be due to optimization of some sort..? I'm not an expert; I wouldn't know.\n\n\nNEUTRAL:\n\n+/- The deed: I would have liked a better, more slowly revealed fleshing out of what he has done, as it is made more than obvious from the first "item" found. A slow reveal, leading up to a shocking "ermagerd!" moment would have been grand, but, I can also appreciate why they chose this line of progression. I just wish they had found a way to make it more shocking. Although, the way it is leaves a lasting feeling of unease, and discomfort. Well done, overall, but my preference puts this in "neutral" ground for me.\n\n\nPROS:\n\n+ The Voice-acting/line-reading: It's very well suited to the character and gives a deranged, yet sophisticated feel to his presence. There isn't a constant nattering in your ear, nor is there a lack of dialogue. It's placed perfectly, and fits the game atmosphere appropriately. Well done~\n\n+ The Atmosphere: Brilliant. The game has a haunting and unsettling vibe to it, yet still maintains an air of sophistication, albiet one that seems to have been a fall from grace, for lack of better words. It really "paints a picture" of what went on in that house, and is going on in the mind of the Artist himself.\n\n+ The Graphics: They look amazing. Great job. In both "Low" and "High" settings, the game looks fantastic. I have to play this in "low" settings to ensure that the game doesn't randomly crash (seems to help?), but, it looks great :)\n\n+ The Story: Both intriguing and disturbing, this game really makes you want to continue to find out what went on in the household, and what is still occuring within the mind of the Artist. You're unnerved, but you want to know what he did in its entirety. Very good momentum.\n\n+ The In-game Artwork: As an artist myself, and a fan of this style, I am in love with the art chosen for this game. It's just... mesmerizing :)\n\n+ The Soundtrack: Spot on. Good choice. If this was composed by someone on the Dev's "team", then they should get an A+. If it was 3rd party, well, great choice regardless :)\n\n+ Early Access->Final Product: The changes made since Early Access were grand. I expected the game to be similar to the "Early Access" version that I played through, but, upon playing the Final Version, I found it was tweaked perfectly, with more revisions and better inclusions. Certain points in the progression have been changed, for the better, and repetition of certain events has been cut drastically. Tres bien~ :)\n\n\n=======\n\nDo I recommend?\nABSOLUTELY.\n\nIf you're a fan of horror games, whether jump-scare or psychological, this game will appeal to you.  If you're a fan of mystery games, artwork, and narratives, well, this will appeal to you (more of a visual narrative).\n\nIf you don't like any of the above, well... you're missing out, you pansy~ xF\n\n10/10 would play again.\nKeeping installed so as to revel in it's beauty, again, at a later date~","August 31, 2015","true","5.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

Although it's not 100% complete I'd say it's right on track with the early Silent Hill games, Amnesia, Penumbra, and the like.\n\nGood:\n-Graphics, art design, visual effects, and use of sound are all outstanding.\n-The game does a terrific job of focusing your attention on certain things and using that to scare you.\n-Perhaps the game's greatest strength is how seamless the room transitions are. I won't spoil any more than that.\n-Very happy that this game was created using Unity, an amazing free to use engine.\n-Amazing that just about all of the creepy artworks are from real life.\n-An interesting narrative that will hopefully have a twist or a revelation in the end, it doesn't overwhelm the player with too much info so that's good too.\n\nBad:\n-It's still early access, so it's not done. I played through it in about 2 hours.\n-My fairly new computer was pushed to the limit on this one, there might be some optimization issues that still need to be addressed. The framerate was somewhat choppy throughout but not so bad that I couldn't enjoy it or stream it for others.\n\nIf you have any interest in scaring yourself or others I highly recommend that you buy the Early Access version of the game to support the developers, turn the lights off and prepare to soil yourself.

It looks good. The story is great. The atmosphere is phenomenal. I was really anxious at some parts because the game is so unpredictable and innovative. It uses level shifting in a really great way.\nThe horror elements are perfect. Due to the overall pacing of the game an immersive atmosphere is uphold throughout the playable story. Unlike games that pretend to be horror games, but only overwhelm you with massive amounts of splatter and gore, the Layers of Fear uses subtle methods instead to create psycholigical horror. While there are many jump scares thorughout the game, the actual story which unfolds itself through collectibles has a significant impact on the way you perceive the actual game world and contributes greatly on the lasting impact this game has on your mind.\n\nWhile the actual game itself is short, I cant complain much for this relative low price.","September 20, 2015","true","10.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Games like this is why I prefer PC gaming. The gaming industry needs more games like this. PC is home to unique games that are not always found on console. It's a good field for new developers, and old. Games like this are created with care. Rather than what EA crams down our throats with all the microtransactions after a $50 DLC. Or what Overkill has recently done. I am always happy to play games like this.\n\nTo talk more about the game, however, for those who are at the edge of their seat with their mouse hovering over the Add to cart button, wondering how to kill their wallet in sacrifice to the money hungry Gaben, consider this:\nPros:\nGame has fantastic graphics in both quality & in the way they are used to create illusions.\nSuspenseful & Mysterious\nStory Seems to Unfold Beautifully (So Far)\nDidn't find any glitches in the couple hours I played so far.\nCons:\nNot finished yet. If you noticed many review play times were up to 2 hours.\n\nConclusion: This game is a work of art in my eyes. Not very scary for me, but if you get scared easily, and you wanna\nget spooked, buy it. However, I would wait until it is finished, or when the game reviews start popping up with total play\ntimes being like 5 hours or more. Be patient, and keep in mind that the Devs are trying to release large updates, rather than small bug patches or 10 more mins of play time. I am excited for the final release of this product.","October 19, 2015","true","6.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you can't tell by the "overwhelmingly positive" user reviews, this game is a must buy for horror fans and the first early access game that has been completely worth every penny (at least in my opinion). Despite how short it is, this game immediately became my favorite in the horror genre to date.\n\nIt plays like a combination of PT (a moment of silence for what could have been) and Amnesia, and it pulls it off flawlessly with its incredible art direction and consistently impressive soundtrack. Sure it relies on jump scares here and there, but they don't feel cheap at all since the buildup and tension is drawn out so masterfully.\n\nBuy this game, if you're a horror fan, you won't regret it.","September 7, 2015","true","5.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Graphically good-looking, atmospheric, subtle and effective, this Early Access game already feels like a full game. Every event is a pleasant (and at times unpleasant) surprise. There's something new behind every door you open and it constantly keeps you on your toes. The game doesn't drag things out and it's not filled with jumpscares - it's trying to tell a story and you'll find yourself wanting to get to the end so you can figure out what happened.\n\nLayers of Fear reminds me and makes me miss the Silent Hill's P.T. demo. In many respects it feels like what P.T. could have been and that in itself is an amazing thing. I can guarantee you you will get your money's worth here.

I believe the scariest kind of horror is psychological. Monsters, zombies, serial killers and the like are all well and good, but they’re transient fears. If you kill them, distract them, hide from them, they go away. Psychological fear and trauma however, never go away. They exist inside the player and the lead character, and follow them everywhere they go, growing stronger and more potent as you fall deeper into the rabbit hole of madness. It doesn’t make you fear for your life, but for your sanity. Luring you into the foreboding sense that they you are in fact losing your own mind. As the line between fantasy and reality blurs further and further the more the game progresses. And while that kind of horror is not for everyone. It is for me. And if it is for you this game is a must play","February 15","true","15.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/uncageable/recommended/391720/","uncageable","Gwidhw","http://steamcommunity.com/id/uncageable/","679 products in account","[UPDATED BASED ON FINAL RELEASE]\n\nLayers of Fear is an intense, emotional horror game with a very interesting and disturbing story.\n\n=======\n\nCONS:\n\n- Game crashing: I am consistently having issues relating to this game crashing. Only with this game, am I having the issue where my "Display driver has failed and been reset successfully" or some such thing. It renders the game unplayable (AMD Radeon HD). I have been able to make it work, however, by launching it via the "Radeon Settings" panel, but, it still crashes every now and then, though not as often as it did when launched directly through Steam. Could it be due to optimization of some sort..? I'm not an expert; I wouldn't know.\n\n\nNEUTRAL:\n\n+/- The deed: I would have liked a better, more slowly revealed fleshing out of what he has done, as it is made more than obvious from the first "item" found. A slow reveal, leading up to a shocking "ermagerd!" moment would have been grand, but, I can also appreciate why they chose this line of progression. I just wish they had found a way to make it more shocking. Although, the way it is leaves a lasting feeling of unease, and discomfort. Well done, overall, but my preference puts this in "neutral" ground for me.\n\n\nPROS:\n\n+ The Voice-acting/line-reading: It's very well suited to the character and gives a deranged, yet sophisticated feel to his presence. There isn't a constant nattering in your ear, nor is there a lack of dialogue. It's placed perfectly, and fits the game atmosphere appropriately. Well done~\n\n+ The Atmosphere: Brilliant. The game has a haunting and unsettling vibe to it, yet still maintains an air of sophistication, albiet one that seems to have been a fall from grace, for lack of better words. It really "paints a picture" of what went on in that house, and is going on in the mind of the Artist himself.\n\n+ The Graphics: They look amazing. Great job. In both "Low" and "High" settings, the game looks fantastic. I have to play this in "low" settings to ensure that the game doesn't randomly crash (seems to help?), but, it looks great :)\n\n+ The Story: Both intriguing and disturbing, this game really makes you want to continue to find out what went on in the household, and what is still occuring within the mind of the Artist. You're unnerved, but you want to know what he did in its entirety. Very good momentum.\n\n+ The In-game Artwork: As an artist myself, and a fan of this style, I am in love with the art chosen for this game. It's just... mesmerizing :)\n\n+ The Soundtrack: Spot on. Good choice. If this was composed by someone on the Dev's "team", then they should get an A+. If it was 3rd party, well, great choice regardless :)\n\n+ Early Access->Final Product: The changes made since Early Access were grand. I expected the game to be similar to the "Early Access" version that I played through, but, upon playing the Final Version, I found it was tweaked perfectly, with more revisions and better inclusions. Certain points in the progression have been changed, for the better, and repetition of certain events has been cut drastically. Tres bien~ :)\n\n\n=======\n\nDo I recommend?\nABSOLUTELY.\n\nIf you're a fan of horror games, whether jump-scare or psychological, this game will appeal to you.  If you're a fan of mystery games, artwork, and narratives, well, this will appeal to you (more of a visual narrative).\n\nIf you don't like any of the above, well... you're missing out, you pansy~ xF\n\n10/10 would play again.\nKeeping installed so as to revel in it's beauty, again, at a later date~","August 31, 2015","true","5.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

Take Layers of Fear, for instance, a game in which you get to explore the mind of an artist, as he dwells in his solitude and ponders his magnum opus.\n\n...Sure, he's deranged....and he may be a serial killer, haunted by the spirit of his deformed dead wife and child....but ART, man!\n\nLayers of Fear is one of those new wave indie games found frequently on Steam or in Humble Bundle deals (I snagged mine at Green Man Gaming for a nice discount on a Steam key copy). It's not about shooting stuff, or even about a coherent story, necessarily. Instead, it's about an experience.\n\nOn the Venn Diagrams of "roller-coaster rides" and "Deep psychological horror experiences" you'll find Layers of Fear smack in the center, offering an experience in which you make your way through the visions of a man either deranged or tormented (or both) in a surreal depiction of what is either a grotesque personal haunting, a madman's mind, or something more profane (such as a personal purgatory made real).\n\nThe story is told in bits and pieces as you advance, each piece suggesting the bigger picture at work. Occasionally you will run into vaguely challenging puzzle bits, but nothing remotely weird or unusual; this is not a puzzle game, and what "puzzles" you find are ultimately part of the overall process of moving the experience forward. The longest roadblock I ran in to took about three minutes to figure out, for example...and only because I wasn't looking for something obvious.\n\nOne thing which kept coming to my mind while playing....and if you play, you'll see why....was a vague sense that there was more than a little inspiration from Lovecraft's Rats in the Wall sand Pickman's Model. There's no explicit narrative connection, but the thematics, visuals, and occasional...ah....rat will have you suspecting that that Layers of Fear is in the same ballpark as these tales.\n\nAnother reason to enjoy Layers of Fear: it has some geuine, strikingly weird visual moments, well worth experiencing. There's even a moment which starts off as hauntingly beautiful (when you are in the little girl's bedroom with the mobile casting pictures on the walls) that eventually transforms....by your own hands....into something truly horrific. Very impressive stuff, and nothing like I've seen in other games of this type.\n\nThe total game experience lasted me about 3 hours, but it was well spent time. The base retail price is $19.99 but if you can find a copy for $10 or less you should grab it; if you are really, really in to this genre of horror experiences (I hesitate to really call any of them "games") then snag it at retail, you won't be disappointed. Or wait for the VR edition of the future....this game would make a great VR experience, I suspect.\n\nOriginally Posted at http://realmsofchirak.blogspot.com/2016/05/mini-review-layers-of-fear-pc-version.html","May 30","true","3.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

'Layers of Fear' draws on art history, Lovecraft, Poe and others, synthesising them into a psychological exploration of an artist's fractured mind as he attempts to work through the loss of his family.\n\nIn terms of mood and mechanics, it feels somewhat like what I saw of the 'Silent Hills' demo; you explore and interact with the environment to move the story forward: the way you interact with the world will affect how things unfold. It falls somewhere between the uninteractive walking simulator and a full adventure game. However, the game's relative lack of mechanics never bothered me, as the art and sound design, the narrative, the environments, the use of visual effects to suggest feelings/mental state are all absolutely brilliant and compelling in their own right.\n\nThis is one of the very few games that have ever delivered on the promise of telling a story effectively through a game engine, while also using game mechanics effeciently and intelligently to enhance its storytelling.

CREEPY!!!! TERRIFYING!!!! HORRIFY!!!! chills came ****ing down when I saw IT, the (******) no spoiler allowed. This game man o man o man this game will strike terror into your soul. One said you don't need gruesome events to be scary, holy **** they were 100% right. What were the devs on when creatating this 2 hours so far of a masterpice. Yes their are three path to choose but don't know if it will lead to a different ending. that enough of my of my rumbling.\n\nmy specs thought on the game!\n\nThe audio is 7.1 and 5.1 only so headphone recomended but not recomended 100% volume go with 65% because the audio could get loud in some areas.\n\nmusic and sounds are like a mixture of horror games that I think are amnesia for pigs and somthing else\n\n10/10 HD graphic can handle super bad laptop and pc on low setting. For high end graphic this game still needs some twek and updates.\n\nControls are extremely responsive for keyboard and mouse 10/10 quality and a controller use still need some fixing so its 8.5/10 so far.\n\nGamplay : even though some rooms feel repetitive, some of the furniture look like they were copied and paste. warnnig this is a open furniture and a walking simulator that gives the creepy chills with every step forward.\n\nThe paintings can screw themselves o you will know what I mean when you play the game. Well the paintings on the wall are repetitive but do tell a story thats dark with humor. Also the paintings are beautifully odd with a little of awkwardness that makes you wander. what?\n\nThe atmosphere makes you not want to take another step but you Know have to untill you see the thing that haunts you or makes you rage quit.\n\ninteraction: the content that you can inderact are just I think 8 thing that actually do something dramatic to the story and the rest are things you read or opening doors. The game actually starts after the second time you look at the painting that is covored. so 30 min wasted. this feels like a game two people could make.\n\nthe three path all end to one path at the last coverd painting sad to see that happen. After playing layer of fear I gotta say that if a mirical does not happen then this game would be a waste of money and time and I don't want it to be like that. It has greatness but the game feels like it will be 3 or 4 hours max of just walking.\n\nHate how you don't get to choose what happends next like if did not go to the with the baby room somthing will happen and if you did somthing else will happen. Don't make it a point were you have to do everything :'(. Games are meant to be played more than once and this game does not understand that concept\n\nIf Layers of Fear has VR support 100% to not try. Insanity sure to occure if its able to and then tried.","October 9, 2015","true","18.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","3"

I love the whole changing rooms idea (Very similar to P.T. when it was still available on PSN). However, unlike P.T., you're not going through the same hallway over and over and over again. It's an entire victorian era manor (in I believe the 1960's) you get to explore. Every door you open is a new surprise.\n\nThe atmosphere in this game is incredible. The devs took ideas from Amnesia and P.T. and combined them to make a potential masterpiece. Everything from the sound, lighting, and artwork will give you the chills as you explore your own home (or is it?).  The story is something I found very interesting. I found myself wanting to know more about  the background of the main protagonist, the relationship with his wife and daughter, and why he resorted to violent outbursts and alcoholism... Did he kill his wife and use her body to create art? I MUST KNOW MORE!. The pace is also similar to P.T. You aren't really running from anything, so you can't sprint... Plus you're character appears to have a prosthetic leg of some sort, so you can feel your character kind of limp while walking (you can feel it through hearing the footstep and thud... Really well done sound).\n\nNow for the psychological horror part. I love how they incorporated artwork into generating fear. Am I the only one who finds older portraits creepy? There's one scene in the game, near the beginning, where you fall into the basement into complete darkness. After stumbling around a bit, I managed to find the lightswitch, turn it on, turn around... and BAM! There was this really big, creepy portrait just staring at me, lol. There are some jumpscares... But nothing as cheap as the FNAF series. The use of artwork portraying the protagonist's obvious battle with creator's block and apparent schizophrenia is beyond awesome.\n\nNow... There were some blatant issues... The caption text when compared what's actually written on the object/note does have some grammatical/spelling/mismatch errors.  I did notice on one moment where  the apparent "wife" grabs you and breaks your neck and causes you to pass out  the camera did the look around animation prior actually waking up... Causing you to get a better look at  said "wife". This didn't feel like it was part of the game.\n\nIn it's current state, Layers of Fear has some extreme potential to be among the most recommended psychological horror game for the Halloween season; up there with Amnesia, Penumbra, and now SOMA. If you enjoy those style of games, I highly recommend you buy this and support the devs here. To the devs: Keep it up! You have a gem here, don't drop it. Ignore those who shun this game without providing helpful feedback. I'm looking forward to seeing more from you.\n\nThe Sergeant is signing off!","October 4, 2015","true","4.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

Where do we all start, for that matter?\n\nOf course, for a story like this, we need to start at the beginning.\n\nSo we start off on a journey of pulling yourself back on your feet, as an artist who has fallen from grace in the circles he hanged out in. I'll spare you the story side, aside from the part where the reason why he fell from grace is because he went insane.\n\nStill not offering anything new to the table so far, I'll get to the point. The great thing about this game is the execution of the premise. This game works on the same levels of Silent Hill, where layers of reality are peeled off into something otherworldy. Unlike Silent Hill, however, you don't have monsters to fight along the way to reach your goal. But a game of this genre is not in the monsters you fight; it's in the monsters of the mind, the inner demons. Or, in other words, the tragic pieces of the puzzle that make up the character's background, and that that as the player, you pick up along the way.\n\nAn artist sees the world in a different way than regular people, or so it is said. But just how differently can someone see the world, if you're insane? Reality's all a matter of perception, and in this game, it peels off like some poor-quality painting, a clear indication of how frail the protagonist's mind is.\n\nAlthough still in development at the time I write this review, the game promises some considerable jumps right out of the chair. The daunting atmosphere can be felt from minute one, and the exploration will not allow you to miss one second of it; so all you faint of heart beware, for you will be put to the test, as the growing sense of unease settles in progressively.","October 5, 2015","true","30.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Unlike most horror games where you can have a relative idea of what's going to happen to you, in this game you truly never know what's going to happen. Literally doing something as simple as turning around or opening a random door can change everything. Also the game has like a crescendo kind of effect and flow where right when you thought things couldn't get any worse, they do but in a good way. The unnerving atmosphere, the sheer seamlessness of transitions in scares and environment, the gorgeous graphics, the story, everything in the game makes up for the fact that it is short. Keep in mind once again that this game is early access and they even mention in game that the game isn't finished yet. Personally I felt the game was totally worth the money I payed and was a fun way to get worked up for the Halloween season! I look forward to when they release more content.\n\n~UPDATE 2/17/2016~\n\nSo I beat the game now that it fully released and the game did not disappoint! It's simple if you think about it but it works well for itself. They even added some new stuff to the beginning parts to give us something new to jump at lol.  I won't give any spoilers but just so you know: the game has multiple endings so it's worth replaying once or twice.","October 23, 2015","true","7.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The game is good at being that.\nNot toooo many jump-scares, just the right amount.\nPlenty of dark content.\nEvery new room is unpredictable.\nGreat audio.\nGreat detail to various objects.\nChromatic Aberration and Lens Flares are optional effects.\n\n-Cons-\nToo short for $20. $10-12 would be fine.\nWalking always has slight juddering that players with high framerates will notice.\nSSAO on 'High' is very demanding over 'Low' without much noticeable difference.\nMirror Reflections look like crap. Just keep it off.\n\n-Neutral-\nOptimization is mostly good when SSAO is set to 'Low', but there are still certain areas that chug for no reason. 60 fps was achieved throughout most of the game, using a GTX 660 Ti at 900p (my native res). Unfortunately, console players have it pretty bad (like 27 fps on average). Hopefully the devs can find some way to smooth things out for those guys... like perhaps drop that föcking SSAO to 'Low'.

You are a painter who drives himself into deep madness. Everything seems to be executed very well, and the game is nicely polished ever since its previous versions. I am actually impressed how much the full release of the game has changed. Many of the areas have been changed to more proper places, whereas before, they made no sense at all. Voice acting seems to be pretty solid as well, and absolutely nothing wrong with it. The game could take you about 4-5 hours to complete, maybe less if you're not the explorer type, so it does render the game quite a bit short. However, the short journey you go through will drive you into insanity and fear, literally into layers of fear. I am also impressed with the level of detail the developers have created. The level-changing never fails to surprise, and it is perfectly executed as well.\n\nAt its price, the game offers a terrifying and unforgettable journey, making up for its lack of replayability and linear game-play. Either way, this is a great start for the team, and looking forward to more of their work in the future.","February 19","true","12.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Never have I given a negative recommendation to a game, for I know only few such games. This game may be Early Acces and I damn hope it gets a standing ovation when it will be finished. But let's not change the subject, we're here to praise  Layers of Fear.\n\nA game with high tier graphical output and expressive horror events that revolve around the death(?) of the protagonist's wife and the disappearence of their sole child which drove our poor man into insanity. In this game, insanity warps the labyrinthian home filled with the paintings of the artist into hideous and frightening mockeries of their original intent. Often to the point where one starts to wonder where does a weak perception of reality end and supernatural events start.\n\nA great theme and setting with an ongoing plot that is currently still being readjusted. A GOTY of the year in the becoming right?\n\nNo.\n\nI will say this before it's too late. I will replay this game as it is endlessly, buy steam keys for my family, dog, former lovers and favourite butcher shop in the neighbourhood. But only IF the end version of the game won't be centered around me wandering aimlessly in an endless dark house, already mad, from room to room as if I'm shopping for furniture.\n\nNo, many games did that in the past and I want Layer of Fear to be THE horror game that has a sense of progression similar to an operatic performance. A progression of those surreal jumpscares with highs and lows, trepidation and flow that make it more than ROOM 1 Jumpscare> ROOM 2 Jumpscare< HALLWAY Jumpscare 1 and make a glorious end to the plot from which we already received a few hints in our Early Acces experience.\n\nMaybe I'm asking too much, and that is certainly true since you ALREADY have our money.

These were not gasps; gasps don't break my apartments' "don't be loud & annoying after 10pm" rule. They were out loud & almost certainly annoyed my neighbors.\n\nIf I did not have +5 Constitution from being a survival horror veteran (read: I beat Fatal Frames II & III on Nightmare Mode, come at me bro), then I would probably nope out of this game, BUT I GOT THIS.\n\nThe graphics are beautiful; a lot of thought & attention went into making the setting feel both genuine & discomforting. I compare this to the Fatal Frame games because it has that same degree of immersiveness that I always felt when playing those (& didn't always feel playing other games in the genre). As you begin, it's not exactly clear whether YOU, the protagonist, did something wrong, or whether something wrong was done to you, & there's a much deeper sense of unease in that, I think.\n\nThere are jumpscares, yes, but it feels disingenuous to call them jumpscares because they're not gratuitous; they're actually sort of predictable. The game interacts with objects that are significant to the story, but they're still scary. You walk into a room, you see one of those objects, YOU KNOW SOME ♥♥♥♥ IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN, but it's still scary.\n\nI'm anxious to find out how the story progresses & how it ends. The premise, that an artist is tormented by the work he didn't do, is a premise close to my heart (because "I should be writing right now" is a thing I tell myself maybe 800 times a day).\n\nPlay this game, though; it's loveable.","March 31","true","4.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","2","3","2","0"

The first 30 minutes of the game were very scary and I legit thought it was the scariest game I ever played.  I was playing on full volume and when the first scares started happening I was jumping constantly because I didn’t know what I was getting myself into and they felt unpredictable. However the game started being less scary the more I played because that shock factor had gone. There are jumpscares every single minute to the point where I became immune to them. The game then ended up being just a barrage of loud noises coming from your headphones which is such a shame because the creativity, scary imagery and atmosphere is all there but it wasn’t paced well at all because it was happening constantly. If they made the game twice the length and put the scares once every say 3-5 minutes that scare factor that I was experiencing at the start would have went on the entire time but because it was happening constantly without a rest I couldn’t feel anything from them. The fact that there are no stakes and you can't die doesn't help the game either. It’s such a shame because the level of creativity and imagination in this game is amazing it’s just the pacing of the scares that hold it back.  I can still easily recommend it because of the creativity and scary imagery alone and I am glad that I experienced the game.\n7/10 (Good)","May 19","true","2.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

BUY THIS ONLY ON A MINIMUM 50% SALE.\n\nSo the thing why this game is better your average psychological horror/walking simulator is not because the psychology itself, rather the way it shows it. It's not scary and it's barely a game, but in exchange you get great symbolism and gorgeous art style, that's the least from a game having art as the main subject. The themes are dark and personal, although we can't be entirely sure what exactly happened, but that probably adds to the game. Why? Because we know one thing for sure: the character we control is a maniac and has basically zero sense of reality, I doubt he knows exactly what he had done, therefore we don't know either.\n\nWhat sucks is that it's a walking simulator and it's ridiculously short. It wasn't an overwhelming experience, but it was a good one. I'd just be glad if developers making psychological horrors stopped making their games this short. It's not artsy or anything to not leave room for character development. It's just not complete, just for example look at Silent Hill 2 or Cat Lady, those games are longer, therefore they can show more, more character development (can) brings more symphathy for the characters, more complexity and depth. Just because you fill your game with notes, even if they are interesting, it won't bring the same satisfaction.\n\nSo, I don't know. I liked it, but if not on sale, I can't recommend. Objectively it's a good game, so whatever.","February 29","true","3.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Honestly I've played quite the bit of horror games, from Resident Evil, which may or may not be considered a horror experience as of so far, all the way to SOMA and Amnesia: Dark Descent and Machine for Pigs. The amount of horror you get from games like that don't always appear genuine. In fact, while playing Amnesia, I don't think I got the feels I did from a game like Layers of Fear.\n\nThis game seduces me into the story. While I'm looking at notes and hunting rat pictures, I end up turning around to find that what I thought would be behind me was actually not there, instead a wonderful jump scare or two would greet me. That was wonderful, but when you think about that it seems like the jump scares would quickly get to be stale. Wrong. They end up getting creative with things and set up scares where you'd never expect them, and then switch right back to where you would expect them.\n\nDevelopers of Layers of Fear knew exactly what kind of community they were trying to hit. Those who enjoy story and those who enjoy horror. They definately matched what they were going for. And this is coming from someone who had never heard of the game before I found it on Steam.\n\nAgain 10/10. I will most likely be playing this over and over again just to delve farther into the very pleasing story and horror environment. Well done.","February 16","true","4.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Schizophrenic? Delirious? Combined with heavy alcoholism, hallucinating the hell out of this world? Not knowing where you are? whether what you see is real? Are you remembering or experiencing the present? Whether you are dwelling in one of the dark corners of your desillusioned broken brain? Are you dead?\n\nThis game is what nightmares are made of. Beautiful, crippling, disturbing, hellish, tragic nightmares. I understand that these descriptions may make the game sound chaotic and without sense, but it's really well made, consistent and a true gaming experience that no other form of medium could deliver.\n\nLayers of Fear is incredibly smart. I want to praise the developers for following their ideas to the end and doing something different. The game is really beautiful, the dark ambience soundtrack is one hell of a mood setter, the effects and physics are also truly convincing (especially when things stop behaving as they should).\n\nMy advice is to play this game slowly, when it's dark and with headphones. Observe your surroundings. Listen to the sounds. Ingest every location. Don't rush it. Turn slowly. And when you find a god-damn writing on the wall that says "don't look back", seriously, don't look back. And the last tip: don't play this before you go to sleep. Also avoid mirrors and paintings in real life for at least 1 hour.\n\nDon't look back.","March 4","true","7.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

Keep that in mind while I review it, because I'm going to say some things that might seem negative. Layers of Fear is a wholly atmospheric game with very little in the way of gameplay, a 'haunted house simulator' along the vein of Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs. Very much inspired by P.T., it uses its environment to scare and unnerve you instead of relying on jump scares or forced stealth gameplay. The story is quite obvious, and the game uses numerous cliches, but for me, it simply worked. The 'paint' and 'painting' theming was well used, and it had some very good set pieces to it.\n\nI do, however, have one major complaint. The game (apparently) has multiple endings based on some of the choices you made during play. This, and how well some of the mementos, drawings and letters were hidden made me feel like the developers were trying to force replayability into a game that, since it's akin to a walk-through haunted house, will never have any.\n\nIf you don't mind a few playthroughs to see absolutely everything, and you don't mind an experience that's low on gameplay(like A Machine for Pigs, Dear Esther, or Gone Home) then this is an excellent horror game.","February 27","true","3.6"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Шкафчики, шуфлядки и т.д. открываются движением мышки, предметы можно рассматривать вблизи, есть особые комнаты и места, где можно разыскать записки, рисунки, фотографии, вырезки из газет, а также особые предметы, при рассматривании которых раздаются "голоса прошлого". И все это в ходе игры проливает свет на действительность.\n+ Обновления. Игру дополняют новыми деталями\n\n- Иногда проседает fps (Возможно, проблема моя личная)\n- Нельзя двигать ВСЕ предметы и "рассматривать" их\n- Часто используется прием, при котором, к примеру, передняя дверь закрыта и приходится ходить туда-обратно, чтобы она открылась. (Честно, все это с натяжкой можно называть минусами, тем более, что плюсы полностью покрывают их)\n\nИгра хочет, чтобы вы БОЯЛИСЬ оборачиваться. И вы БУДЕТЕ бояться повернуться.\nОна мрачна, пугающа, поражающая абсурдностью происходящего. Жуткая, но вместе с тем, обладающая неким очарованием. Она не будет держать в постоянном напряжении. Она позволит расслабиться на минуту-другую, чтобы продолжить терроризировать вас с новыми силами.\n","February 27","true","5.6"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","2"

Yes the visuals are great (though some of the effects break the immersion, especially the plastic-looking black goo that appears in places). It has a great deal of potential, but it just was not well executed. Maybe I have been spoiled by games like Amnesia and Outlast, but the horror elements didn't affect me and it became more of a task to finish than an immersive experience. Half of the problem is the poor control and interaction system. You have to be in very precise locations and at specific angles to interact with the objects, which becomes even more frustrating when you have to open doors through holding a button and rotating/moving. This often became extremely frustrating, since much of the game is just opening doors or drawers.\n\nIf they worked out a better control system and fleshed out the game a bit more, it certainly would be a game to pick up, but right now I cannot recommend it at full or even half price.","May 14","false","3.9"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","9","17","0","0"

Just so we are clear!\n\nI have played many, many, many horror games.... with that being said.\n\nThis game is a really solid horror game. I actually really liked this game for being an early access to be completely honest. It's so rare anymore that a game actually gives me chills or makes me second guess what I'm doing or in fact ****ing scare the **** out of me.\n\nWas that supposed to happen? Why did the thing I thought was gonna happen NOT happen? Why is this rooom CONSTANTLY changing on me?!\n\nEverytime I died, or atleast thought I died, I awoke in the same room only to enter a COMPLETELY different room. This made me feel very confused a lot of the time since I had NO idea how this game functions as far as life and death. It's actually refreshing in a game to NOT know if you are doing things right.\n\nOverall, I would rate this game as in it's current state a 8/10.\n\nIt has an overall good feel to it. It's interesting. It's crazy. it makes you feel like you are going ****ing insane sometimes. And that's totally what this genre needs in my opinion.

It is more a "journey within" that carries many elements of horror than a game centered on horror itself; that is to say that the focus lies within the story.

Piecing together layers of fear's story through letters and images is surprisingly fun due to good writing and interesting, well paced plot development. I found myself looking forward to reading each new story fragment. The story is suitably dark, greatly adding to the overall tension of the experience.\n\nLayers of Fear is often terrifying, making good use of well paced and foreshadowed jump scares and thick tension. However, Layers of Fear truly excels when it is most surreal. No frightening moments were quite as memorable as watching furniture swirl around a room to the sound of classical music.\n\nLayers of Fear also bears a strikingly distinct visual style. Hallways are littered with beautiful and bizarre paintings, many of which serve as nice motifs throughout the game. Many of these paintings carry unique and unsettling looks which make them instantly recognizable. Apart from the visual style, Layers of Fear is also one of the best looking games I have ever seen on the Unity engine, and serves as a testament to the power and flexibility of Unity's tool set. Sound design is also good, although it does make use of some fairly familiar noises. They are all well implemented, but be prepared to hear some high pitch screeches and other common horror sounds. One area of the sound design that does not suffer is the music, which always comes on at just the right time. It is peaceful and provides great contrast to the dark atmosphere.\n\nLayers of Fear is a beautiful, surreal, and frightening trip into the mind of a broken man. What it lacks in traditional game-play mechanics it makes up for with a thick atmosphere and a great story.  Any fans of horror games will certainly find a lot to enjoy within Layers of Fear's winding halls.","February 27","true","2.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Layers of Fear takes a similar approach to games such as Penumbra and Amnesia: The Dark Descent as it uses a couple of similar mechanics. The player gets to roam around the artists mansion and uncover small detail on his life before you - the artist begins to reflect on a project that will warp the home into what lurks inside this unhinged man. The game uses excellent timing and scripting that will alter the perception of the artist.\nWhile Layers of Fear has a few things that need to improve as the time I am writing this the studio has done a tremendous job of building up a character and his house with pride only to see the dark depth that lies behind that canvas.\n\nMy only gripe and a message to the developer is to add more roaming and utility to the space that is available make the home more than hallway haunted house. The gameplay should give more options for failure and more puzzles to confuse the player and not go through step by step key by door unlock. With that being said Layers of Fear is a psychological horror that paints a beautifully deranged future for the true horror genre. I hope to see more like this from this studio.\n\nNOTE: Do realize this game is in Early Access and is not a finished product. At this time the game will give you around 2.5 hours of gameplay or so and I would expect with the detail given so far that the game will have around 6-7 hours of gameplay time in all with the finished product.","October 31, 2015","true","5.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I had permanent goosebumps the whole time.  You never know when something freaky might happen so you're on edge all the time.  It's not just standard scary.  It's like fear on drugs.\n\nI really enjoy the story that you piece together as you gather photos and notes from around the house.  You come to find that your character seems to have some seriously dark issues.  And, I've come away still not 100% understanding exactly what happened.  So, I might play again to try to find the notes I missed to piece the whole story together.\n\nI really enjoyed this game, but thought that it was far too short to warrant spending $21.99.\n\nI played this game on my Twitch stream and it only took five hours to complete.  This includes all of the time I chatted with viewers and went on breaks which is quite a lot.\n\nI'd definitely recommend it if it's on sale.   I'd only give it a 60% recommendation if it's not on sale and you really like games like this.","March 12","true","11.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

While there are few instances where you will feel threatened with your life, death isn't the end. It's simply another choice. Every cause has an effect, and here you're urged to approach danger with curiosity, not run away in fear. Doing either will lead to a whole other story.\n\nSo don't fear the danger, but approach it cautious. Do you want to know what happened to your wife?\nThere's only one way to find out...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGame highly recommended, I don't regret buying it at full retail and will still say it's worth it. I've played for ten hours after the pre-release and have still not finished, because taking your time, observing your surroundings and searching for the past is the only way you're going to find out what the hell is going on in this place. Not to mention it has high replay value due to the amount of choices one can make to progress the story a little differently each time.","March 17","true","13.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","1","2","2","0"

The basics are all there, the atmosphere gives a nod to the very classic style of horror media, the sounds are creeping, and visuals are stunningly detailed.\n\nThe overall storyline (no spoilers) follows the line of little breadcrumbs leading into the finale. I'd say the insane artist is portrayed in a very classic manor, kind of reminding me of the Edgar Allan Poe style spooky-spooky readings.\n\nThe game did already in Beta/Early Access state leave quite positive feelings regarding the quality of the game, but unfortunately the developer team can't quite capture the very edge of what makes AAA quality horror.\n\nI find that the game has tedious parts where it seems that the game repeats itself too much and the player isn't constantly holding breath for the next big thing. This kind of pacing has it's place, but I feel they've stretched it a tad too far and leaves the player just thinking, how much bigger and more effective could've those parts be.\n\nCredit is due where it shows, or whatever they say about it. This studio has shown it's potential in making a game that plunges into a fresh direction in the otherwise so boring genre. For a beginner of horror game consumption, the number below will be higher for sure.\n\n3.5/5","March 26","true","5.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

My growing madness, my hatred of rats, my unfinished opus magnum, my enjoyment of a good drink. Not to mention when ever I walk through a door it always leads somewhere else on the way back.\n\nThe game plays like spending 2 hours in a haunted house. While it's no Mc cready manor the atmosphere is worth playing for alone.You wont leave broken and crying but will be taken by the enthralling concept of the painter gone mad. The game attempts to scare players with haunted props and occasionally a monster. However it's hard to be frightened once you look closer and realize the monster and set dressings are made of animatronics and plastic. Since you can't actually be killed and your fate is predetermined you are more of a carnival patron wandering down a set route until your ticket time expires and you're asked to leave.\n\nThis doesn't mean the game is bad though, as the ambiance, tone and atmosphere are all very  engaging, enough to keep you immersed and intrigued. The game is surreal utilizing madness/psychedelic visions rather than traditional monster cliches (for the most part). The game looks good and appropriately creepy with it's period decor. While the audio is also strong I'm still not entirely sold on the voice acting. Seeming a little predictable when read out to us, I feel it can slightly hurt the overall mood. The idea being mystery may remain more eerie.The concept it's self of horror revolving around paintings is interesting and well done. Capturing how unsettling these old masters works can be.\n\nWith a few more game play elements or perhaps puzzles this experience could be enhanced. As it is now though the game still deserves a play through by fans of surreal horror.","September 16, 2015","true","2.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Piecing together layers of fear's story through letters and images is surprisingly fun due to good writing and interesting, well paced plot development. I found myself looking forward to reading each new story fragment. The story is suitably dark, greatly adding to the overall tension of the experience.\n\nLayers of Fear is often terrifying, making good use of well paced and foreshadowed jump scares and thick tension. However, Layers of Fear truly excels when it is most surreal. No frightening moments were quite as memorable as watching furniture swirl around a room to the sound of classical music.\n\nLayers of Fear also bears a strikingly distinct visual style. Hallways are littered with beautiful and bizarre paintings, many of which serve as nice motifs throughout the game. Many of these paintings carry unique and unsettling looks which make them instantly recognizable. Apart from the visual style, Layers of Fear is also one of the best looking games I have ever seen on the Unity engine, and serves as a testament to the power and flexibility of Unity's tool set. Sound design is also good, although it does make use of some fairly familiar noises. They are all well implemented, but be prepared to hear some high pitch screeches and other common horror sounds. One area of the sound design that does not suffer is the music, which always comes on at just the right time. It is peaceful and provides great contrast to the dark atmosphere.\n\nLayers of Fear is a beautiful, surreal, and frightening trip into the mind of a broken man. What it lacks in traditional game-play mechanics it makes up for with a thick atmosphere and a great story.  Any fans of horror games will certainly find a lot to enjoy within Layers of Fear's winding halls.","February 27","true","2.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Layers of Fear takes a similar approach to games such as Penumbra and Amnesia: The Dark Descent as it uses a couple of similar mechanics. The player gets to roam around the artists mansion and uncover small detail on his life before you - the artist begins to reflect on a project that will warp the home into what lurks inside this unhinged man. The game uses excellent timing and scripting that will alter the perception of the artist.\nWhile Layers of Fear has a few things that need to improve as the time I am writing this the studio has done a tremendous job of building up a character and his house with pride only to see the dark depth that lies behind that canvas.\n\nMy only gripe and a message to the developer is to add more roaming and utility to the space that is available make the home more than hallway haunted house. The gameplay should give more options for failure and more puzzles to confuse the player and not go through step by step key by door unlock. With that being said Layers of Fear is a psychological horror that paints a beautifully deranged future for the true horror genre. I hope to see more like this from this studio.\n\nNOTE: Do realize this game is in Early Access and is not a finished product. At this time the game will give you around 2.5 hours of gameplay or so and I would expect with the detail given so far that the game will have around 6-7 hours of gameplay time in all with the finished product.","October 31, 2015","true","5.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There are many meanings ingame which leads to a lot of different theories which make this game so exciting! It has multiple endings depending on your playstyle and I believe that there is a secret ending...!\n\nThis game can be completed in 4 hours if you rush it on your first playthrough but it offers multiple endings and many secrets so it will take a while to complete all the achievement.\n\nThe only thing that I would complain is the usage of loud scary sounds like on those cheap horror movies.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Er3Dr4n/recommended/391720/","Er3Dr4n","Er3.Dr4n","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Er3Dr4n/","280 products in account","I approached this game not as a survival horror junkie looking for my next sleepless night fix like Amnesia or SOMA, but more about the main protagonist’s tragic story, along the lines of Dear Esther and Gone Home. And it’s brilliant. The game is an interactive story novel rather than a game with a challenge, and there’s no losing condition whatsoever. However finding more clues can alter which ending you receive.\n\nOn that note, finding clues throughout the game provides a cryptic non-direct story telling narrative that heavily suggests (however doesn’t directly imply) what happened to the painter’s family, the loss of his muse, his downfall from the peak of his career, the impact it had on his mental psyche, his marriage, the toll on his mental health, until its ultimate tragic conclusion and the painter’s failure to cope with it. The result of which being his extreme mental illness entailing hallucination, schizophrenia, masochism, etc. We as the player are invited to see his extremely warped mental mind as he strives to complete his Magnum Opus in hopes that will cure him of his insanity and the suffering he’s endured will be worth it. Or will it? The narrative leaves out just enough for us on purpose to fill in the pieces about what really happened.\n\nAs an artist myself I could sympathize with the loss of the painter’s muse and his absolute frustration on why he couldn’t seem to pull it back together. Something like that has got to be incredibly self-defeating, where one minute the painter is at the top of his career, and in the next it’s all taken away and he loses his creative drive to continue his work, winding up with lackluster paintings panned by critics, which set the tragic stage for everything else to follow.\n\nThe horror elements provided in the game are good, however they do get repetitive towards the end. However I think that’s the point. We the player begin to feel numb and desensitized from the horror presented in the game just like the painter, as that’s his and our way of coping through this new warped mental normality that he’s constructed. Despite all that’s happening around him, he presses onward determined to finish his painting.\n\nAn excellent tragic horror story worth anyone’s time to delve into the mind of a fallen artist.","May 22","true","14.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Apt.\n\nI bought this game based purely on my love for horror and the overwhelmingly positive reviews. What a total flop of a game and a waste of my money.\n\nI didn't find any terror in this game -- just plenty of attempts at cheap jump scares. Wandering the mansion is mind-numbing. The textures, models, and sounds are repetitive. The pace of the game is infuratingly slow. I finished the thing in a wholehearted attempt to find some redeeming quality but as you can guess there was no redeeming quality.\n\nThe game is a design nightmare -- and certainly not the good kind of nightmare. From a technical standpoint, nearly every drawer and cabinet in the game is openable. What's in the drawers? Sunglasses. Books about pandas. Inkwells. War medals. A red herring is fine every once in a great while but sheesh. To open a drawer or a door you have to hold down the trigger on your controller and twist the thumbstick awkwardly. A useless mechanic that adds to the monotony. Save that stuff for Quicktime Events. The game is equally broken from a storytelling standpoint. The letters and drawings are full of tired attemps at dark humor and trite metaphors. The story isn't even especially interesting. There are no puzzles. "Gone Home" is a walking simulator done the best a walking simulator can be done. This is a walking simulator that epitomises the failure of the genre.\n\nA total dissapointment. I'm astounded at how many people love this thing. Is this the "Friends" of the horror video game genre?","May 19","false","3.2"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

For it being just $10'ish is a steal, for those that love Frictional Games and their style of psychological horror - you will find yourself at home with this game.\n\nThe quality, the physics and ability to open things and investigate would remind you easily of Amnesia - the voice acting is great and the overall atmosphere is stunning. The choice, methods and timing of the 'Spooks' are pretty impressive in my books, not many can pull off an environment that makes you immerse yourself almost to the same levels as PS4's P.T. Demo.\n\nNo but seriously, the game is freaking BEAUTIFUL to look at. Few minor flaws may include a very minimal amount of Graphical options beyond it detecting your Resolution, a run of the mill visual setting and the detection of what Hz your monitor is running at - Those who love tweaking their settings or perhaps with low-range computers may run into trouble unless I'm wrong about this games' optimization on lower settings.\n\nSummary: For a game that's 75% done, supposedly, is perhaps so far around 3-4+ hours long, and at the price of $10. This game is completely worth it. $10 is a steal, the price WILL raise when more content is added and as more time passes by so I'd argue that it'd be the best decision to buy it, play it, enjoy it and support the developers. If they were to be successful with this game and get good profit? Would could say otherwise that we may just have Another great studio who're capable of making horror games like Frictional Games - We need more developers like those two. Saying that they remind me of Frictional is one of the best compliments I can give to devs who're doing the Horror genre.\n\nIf you'd like to see for yourself, the quality and my playthrough, I have a Let's Play series of this game being created as we speak! If interested, hope you all enjoy!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCqO8Bezn7s&list=PLROcDxcjtMQwXOgyWjc3Q0hfNWl8LfScl","August 28, 2015","true","6.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

There is also now a turn-speed limit with the mouse no matter how high the sensitivity is set.\nIt was a feat to finish this game and this issue has sucked much of the enjoyment out of it since struggling with controls kills immersion. Considering the controls were pretty much perfect in the older versions it boggles the mind how they could have botched them up this badly with a single update.\n\nWait until a patch to fix controls is implemented or find a way to get your hands on an earlier version.","April 28","false","5.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The visuals, the sound, the concept is brilliant! The atmosphere is kept very tense throughout the game. I often found myself not wanting to enter the next of many rooms you'll face. The 'psychedellic horror' label is very accurate; it's absolutly mind bending and terrifying.  While there are a lot of jump scares, there is an equal amount of physcological horror, so the horror element does not feel cheap at all! I can't wait to see how the game and the story progresses; it's off to a brilliant start.\nDefinetly reccomended!

But just seeing someone else play this, I felt drawn to it. I took a chance. It was well worth it.\n\nThere are things I could nitpick about the graphics, the length, and the replay value, but I don't want to. The game's faults are tiny. The important thing is, there are moments in this game that feel like the nightmares I had after seeing The Shining for the first time. There are gorgeous, mind-warping, Escher-esque moments that are as effective as any bit of visual storytelling I've ever seen. Not just jump scares, but subtle moments that will make you doubt your perceptions and sanity.\n\nI could gripe about how Layers Of Fear can be extremely linear, to the point where the moments of actual gameplay and choice can be few and far between. But it works. It creates a sense of helplessness that adds to the the dread. And it makes you pay special attention to the few choices you do have.\n\nI think this is less of a game than an experience. A halfway point between 'game' and 'movie'. It's like the developers looked at Gone Home and P.T., saw two unfinished concepts, and squeezed them together into one. I love the result.\n\nPlus, it's just so damn luscious to look at.","February 25","true","9.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I first played it back in August as part of the early access, but soon realized that it was going to be much better than I ever expected and decided to wait for the full release. I'm so glad I did. The story is quite compelling. I find myself so caught up that I'm dying to know everything that happened in this man's life. Visually the game is stunning. Everything looks so magnificent, almost photorealistic. While the game has quite a few jumpscares, it doesn't rely on them like so many other games. The atmosphere is oppressive and dismal. Everything feels so lonely and malicious. It's like the entire house is out to get you. You quickly learn that anything can happen at any time. It may only be February, but I feel comfortable saying this could be one of the best horror games of the year.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVOwZqwui8UUztArNueNPUh_p-dgBCP8c","February 26","true","27.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Once I start playing, I just love to immerse myself into a game and get the real feel of the horror and so far this game is freaking me out big time. It reminds me a lot like the PT of Silent Hills and like Amnesia: The Dark Descent the way you interact with things like opening doors and drawers. My first impression after walking into that painting room and getting out was like... "holy ♥♥♥♥, this is one trippy game too wtf?" lol I'm in love with the art and the atmosphere so far, and the music does a very good job blending in as well. If you're a real fan of the cancelled game Silent Hills then you are gonna appreciate this one cause they are very alike with the exception that this one is a psychedelic horror game so I can only imagine a gamer playing this on acid lol\n\n\nAmnesia: The Dark Descent has to be my favorite horror game so far and man have I played a lot of horror titles cause I am a vivid fan of the horror, and unfortunately I've played tons that have disappointed me too but this one looks promising and so far it's delivering the chills so if you wanna go for a haunting adventure, then I totally recommend you to get your hands into this one and play it if you have the guts to do so haha.","February 27","true","9.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I can understand that developers need to recycle objects, but that you keep running past the same paintings literally dozens of times just seems lazy.\n\nStory: Cliché all the way. You literally see it coming from miles away. There is no intrigue or twists, no surprises, no innovation whatsoever.\n\nScare-o-meter: This should probably be the most important factor for any potential buyer. To put it bluntly, the game just isn't frightening (unless you count the 3-5 jumpscares, which frankly I don't). I was actually bored at times. Again, I can't stretch this enough, I was bored playing a Horror game. This is not because I'm some tough-as-nails ubergangster, quite the opposite, I'm actually suffering from advanced stages of ♥♥♥♥♥fication. The problem is that, very early on, I realised that nothing can harm you in this game. With nothing to be afraid of, you will become completely detached and all immersion goes out the window. Ultimately, I just went through the motions and finished the game purely because I wanted to see the final version of the artist's painting.\n\nIn Summation: If you want to play a tense Horror title, go for Amnesia: The Dark Descent (stay away from A Machine for Pigs, though) or Outlast (the Whistleblower DLC is worth it as well).\n\nIf you want to look at pretty setpieces for 3-4 hours, and holy ♥♥♥♥, pretty they are, play Layers of Fear.

It is a game that attempts to tap in to the deepest darkest parts of the human psychie and take you to places where your sanity dare not follow you. From what I have experienced thus far, this game transcends a lot of the externalistically framed horror cleches and instead twists such ideas in a unique way that presents you with the most personal and horrific idea of all: what dark secrets lay waiting within me?\n\nAlong with brilliant proof of concept, the strangly alluring yet spine tingling atmosphere in this game rivals that of all past successful modern horror games, such as Outlast, Alien Isolation, etc. Although still in Alpha and not yet completed, this is one masterpeice all horror gaming fans must own!","August 30, 2015","true","1.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

I've been scared by exactly two games I've played.  Among the Sleep, and Layers of Fear.  The atmosphere that Layers creates is amazing.  There are still some graphical bugs, and some places where basic flaws of the engine show through, but for 9 minutes out of 10, you'll be in a beautiful, immersive mansion.\nCombine this atmosphere with effective, and uniqe jump scare tactics that use the environment and seem to blend naturally into the surroundings (unlike FNAF, these scares sneak up on you, and linger after the initial startle), add in the second to none sound design that keeps you on edge, and this one fires all of the right cannons.\nI've never been effectively "gotten" by jump scares, but Layers of Fear blends them into the world so well, and messes with your head in so many ways, that it's just... amazing.

Player is guided through the labyrinthine corridors and rooms of the protaganists home/mind, discovering clues and objects that go some way to explain the unfolding of events. Unrelentlessy claustrophobic each twist and turn brings BOO scares, morphing architecture and paintings and surreal imagery.\nSo is it any good? In its current Early Access state, answer is a reserved Yes.\nSome of the scenes are chilling haunting and genuinely surprising. Where the game is subtle is where it mosts succeeds; was that a human shadow flitting accross the corridor? a figure through the rain lashed window pane illuminated by lightning? The atmosphere is well managed, there is no escape from the tension and the dread of turning round opening a door or turning a corner is all pervasive.\nOn the downside, there are far too many jump scares that ,yes, scare the beejezus outta you, but quickly become the norm, and start to feel a little cheap in consequence.\nThere were some "events" I surely missed because the game did not attract my attention to the occurence, although the sound track indicated something had happened The story up to this point is underdeveloped, and although I felt in the most part immersed in the game this is despite of the story line rather than because of it.\nDespite the usual old horror tropes that don't bring anything "new" to the game genre, if you don't mind jump scares and a linear gameplay, then give this one a go.\n6.5-7/10","September 12, 2015","true","5.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

With the world constantly changing and the pace fluctuating akin to Bill Clinton taking a lie detector test, you hardly find time to appreciate the stunning graphics Layers of Fear has to offer. The experience itself is similar to paying twenty dollars to visit a haunted house attraction, albeit an absolutely spectacular one. This is, without any hint of doubt, the game 'Silent Hills' (May it rest in peace) would have been.\n\nTo elaborate on the semiotic conventions of this game, one would be forced to spoil the story. So to avoid any spoilers I shall say just this:\n"There is a fine line between reality and one's subconscious. However, where that line is, you must play the game to find out"\n\nIn conclusion.

I've been scared by exactly two games I've played.  Among the Sleep, and Layers of Fear.  The atmosphere that Layers creates is amazing.  There are still some graphical bugs, and some places where basic flaws of the engine show through, but for 9 minutes out of 10, you'll be in a beautiful, immersive mansion.\nCombine this atmosphere with effective, and uniqe jump scare tactics that use the environment and seem to blend naturally into the surroundings (unlike FNAF, these scares sneak up on you, and linger after the initial startle), add in the second to none sound design that keeps you on edge, and this one fires all of the right cannons.\nI've never been effectively "gotten" by jump scares, but Layers of Fear blends them into the world so well, and messes with your head in so many ways, that it's just... amazing.

As you turn the knob, instead of the door gently swinging open (which is a normal behavior for doors), it is suddenly torn away by some unseen force and smashes violently into the wall ahead of you. Creepy, right? Not if your brain automatically imagines that the protagonist just gained superpowers and thunder-punched the door into oblivion.\nBut yeah, it's still one of the better horror games I've played, and if you're looking for a good horror game to play for a few hours, get this one.","May 7","true","3.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

I don't have the patience to go through the same crap doing differently subtle things in order to witness an ending that I can easily find on YouTube if my curiousity strikes hard enough. If you get this game for maybe 10 dollars, I recommend it but at full price.... no. Overall this game is gorgeous but it lacks game play. Its puzzles are plentiful and the environment constantly changes around you but its....a walking simulator type game. You can't really die. You don't get chased by anything, you just run into them and then you progress further indicating you didn't really die, rather you went through the motions.\n\nThe game is too short for 20 dollars is mainly why I don't recommend it. Took me 3.3 hours according to my Steam hour counter to complete the bad ending. It does have a cool and more unique kind of plot to it that I haven't seen before in other horror games. Its a psychological horror game and you are in the mind of a painter trying to make the perfect painting in his eyes. Throughout the game you are collecting materials (sort of) and then putting a painting together using those materials. As you progress further into the game, so does the painting and overtime, you see it form into what he's trying to paint. Alas, you get the bad ending, they tell you the painting sucks. Spoiler Alert. Oops.\n\nSo you can't die and the game is a puzzle fest. Yet, even for puzzles, they were rather easy for me. No puzzle had me there for a half hour. It was like maybe 10 minutes max that I was stuck on one puzzle.\n\nThis game copies the Penumbra/Amnesia style of game play where you can manually open things like doors or drawers and that's about it. You can't really pick up things and move them around.\n\nThis game disappointed me. Once you figure out that you're not really in harms way, you might as well stop caring like I did. I was not scared of the game anymore and I just went through the rest of the journey until I was told that my painting sucks. Spoiler Alert again. Yeah, if its 10 dollars or less, pick it up unless you don't own Outlast. Then buy Outlast and play that instead.","February 27","false","3.3"," 15 of 32 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","15","32","0","0"

But, it wasn't all their ideas, and it only had a 3-hour storyline. The best parts of the game were mostly ripped off from other movies and games. For an example, I had to walk around in circles until I had to walk back instead to finish the section. Layers of Fear clearly ripped ideas from PT. Another was a flickering light outside of a window, and you turn around and a jump scare. Yeah, that's been in every slasher movie in history. A window is open, and you see a ghostly figure in the curtain. The only scene I saw this is on The Conjuring and welp, this game took it. I am surprised I didn't have a "Mirror Scare" or "Tripping over a twig because I am running away from something" cliches.\n\nI understand if you call me jaded, but Japanese horrors always come up with cool new scares and Americanised filmed or created 'art' just tires me. But, that's okay. The problem is, that, the game is way too short. Sure, they have stolen nearly every scene and cliche you can think of, but that is what people want. I only disliked the game just because of its shortness. And in no way, I would recommend spending $20 USD (Around $28 for AUD) for a three-hour game.\n\nDon't buy the game, don't torrent it. Look, if you want to support the creators, purchase the game and just watch it on Youtube. The game will be much better this way. And that is just my opinion.\n\nIf the game were 8 hours long (Long as a below average horror game) I would rate the game probably an 8/10\n\nBut since the game only went for 3 hours (By not rushing) I have to rate it\n\n5/10\n\nBuy it if you're seriously bored.","March 3","false","3.1"," 8 of 18 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","8","18","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bastwood/recommended/391720/","bastwood","Bastwood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bastwood/","689 products in account","Few games display the brand of their engine right in their main title card. Layers of Fear does, and it's easy to see why. The game is a tour-de-force of the latest and greatest Unity 5 graphics and physics features, and looks gorgeous. The Victorian house the game is set in is a beautiful design, with supremely moody lighting and decoration.\n\nYou play as a tormented, peglegged painter deliriously shuffling through both your memories and the building itself, turning the place upside down while rummaging the rooms filled with snippets of the past. The mansion gradually turns into a representation of your psyche as you venture deeper into mania, with walls closing in and rooms rearranging themselves.\n\nBecause you can never construct a mental map of the house, exploration isn't a thing in Layers of Fear. Quite contrary, your progression is extremely one-tracked. The process of opening cupboards, drawers and doors imitates the Frictional Engine style of tactility, but gameplay-wise there's not much else to do. The game could be compared to a fairground ghost train that steadily chugs along, with a fright at every turn. And therein lies its greatest folly: Oversaturation of cheap jumpscares.\n\nLayers of Fear is filled to the brim with startles, dissonant chords, stuff shoved at your face and loud things going bang in the night -- So much that it very quickly becomes predictable and completely loses its effect. The backstory is told with promising subtlety, but it gets drowned in the constant jolts the game feels necessary to administer in clockwork fashion.\n\nDespite its technical merits, Layers of Fear is clear disappointment; It simply tries too hard. A little restraint would've gone a long way.","February 20","false","3.7"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

I was super stoked to get throught it; but then everything went bad. The scares just weren't there due to a huge lack of ambience, the game recommends to have headphones in but all that accomplished was blasting high pitched notes into my eardrums occasionally and other loud noises to make me jump. In case the devs are reading this LOUD NOISES=/=SCARY just because you make someone jump doesn't give the same sense of dread as having good ambient sound design.\n\nNot to mention it was a really big pile of horror tropes from other games stitched together, erratic shifting monster? check. Victorian dolls? check. changing environment? check. and you know I was expecting it to be a little bit more of a complex story, seeing as this is just gone home with ghosts basically, but all I got was a fairly mediocre story of artist gone crazy. (Using body parts for the art was especially cheesy)\n\nSo no, for $7 an hour for pretty lame scares you should just go see a movie or something instead.\n\n5/10 2 points were added for the werebaby which was the main reason I chose to write a review.","February 17","false","3.0"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

You just can't die. This doesn't build up tension at all\n- adventure games should have an inventory, if it's meant to be one. If I don't have to keep track of objects why should i care about stuff i find on my way through the game at all. Most of the fragments found are letters or newspaper excerpts.\n- repetitive gameplay. You stay in the same house the whole time and keep reopening the same assets (e.g. drawers of cabinets, trunks,...) over and over, because sometimes they placed some text fragment within one. Those are collected and displayed at the end of the mission. You'll get some achievements, if you find all. I don't know if this affects the outcome of this game.\n- missing guidance: the gameplay is driven by "scary" effects and you can easily miss those, if you're just opening a drawer or if you're standing with your back to the effect. So you turn around and only see some debris moving in the scene. This also doesn't add up to the atmosphere of the game.\n- The door to the previous room gets locked, as soon as you enter a new room. This is really awful, as you often end up at t-junctions and it's unsure which way to go. If you're picking the wrong joice, you will miss a room and have no way of going back.\n- extremely linear gameplay. There's only one way to make progress: follow the path into the next room. The door will lock automatically behind you. Find the next open door. The rooms also contain some collectibles and some triggerable actions. Sometimes it's not clear what to do next to trigger the effect cutscene, so you keep searching the same room over and over until you find some item or trigger the scene. This is especially bad in the last chapter: New items appear after each cutscene and you have to search the whole room again. They're pretty small as well, so this takes time.\n- too short: took me ~4h on first (and last) playthrough\n\nThe gameplay choices didn't work for me. I realized pretty soon, that there's no danger to the player, which kind of ruined the whole atmosphere. Why should I be careful/shocked when I enter a new room if I can't die? Pretty soon I was just enjoying the nice effect and was going on with the game. In the end it wasn't scary at all and the linear gameplay with the locked doors annoyed me.\n\nIn reference to the don't turn around review: oh great i can't die and when i turn around some scary effect will be triggered. This is soo scary, a real horror game.\n\nI do get the impression that the whole point of this game was to finance a catalog of assets for the next game and to produce a tech demo of the engine.\n\n2/10 for the nice graphics. Gameplay and story not recommendable.","February 19","false","3.8"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

I am not a great gamer and tend to play a lot of point and click games. So I can get bored easily. This one drew me in right away. For most of the game the jump scares actually surprised me. I didn't use a walkthrough because I wanted to be surprised- and in the start of the game they tell you the game changes based on your choices. Well, not really. You can find plenty of walkthroughs online so you can get all the collectibles and achievments and the story ends up fairly linear anyway.\n\nThere was a lot of neat detail, and the theme of rats reminded me of Coraline by Neil Gaiman. But I have to agree with reviews that say the game misses the mark. It comes so close. And then the ending is kinda "meh" and you have a lot fo questions that aren't answered. I feel like we only got part of a story and I want to know the entire context. It makes for a big let down I feel. For a game that started out so strong, it sure ends pretty dully.\n\nI feel there was some un explored potential. Are you mad? or is your wife mad? what happened to the kid? the dog? The wheelchair and piano are pretty darm scary.\n\nBut honestly I just dont feel like I can recomend the game based on how much of a flop the endong seems to be. You were sooo close! But dropped the ball. There are 3 different endings apparently and you'll have to replay probably to get them all. But even reading them online doesn't tell me much about the story\n\nIt's not clear at all how to save, and without reading tips online you wouldnt know that you actually "die"","May 1","false","41.7"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

It tries really, really hard. So hard that it ends up not scary at all. While the visuals are stunning, the game itself is not so much a horror game as a museum of horror game tropes. Remember that creepy thing you saw in that game? It's here. You walk from one room to another, wondering what kind of a jump-scare or a mind-screw they'll throw at you this time. Will it be a sudden bloody knife? A woman's shout? A wheelchair following you? A door you open to see a gigantic face staring at you?\nThe problem is, all these special effects are there on their own, existing for their own sake. In Silent Hill, Clocktower, Fatal Frame they served a purpose. Here the excuse plot is so formulaic I can't care about the story or the people. So, while you might enjoy the attractions, there's nothing else to it -- lots of hard work and artistic talent put into creation of a catalogue of cliches.","February 16","false","4.4"," 27 of 57 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","27","57","0","4"

Also, since the game is Early Access, it's only about an hour to two hours of gameplay ( it all comes down to how fast/slow you go )\n\nTo start of, this game is amazing, and this is from someone who RARELY ever buys horror games, i believe the latest i bought was Amnesia: The Dark Descent. This game is here to play tricks with your mind, you'll be thinking things like "a jumpscare is about to happen" when it might not actually happen and you might think "is there someone there?" when it might not be or it might.\n\nThis game appealed to me graphically at first, i liked the graphics in the screenshots so i thought, why the hell not, have a little bit of fun, i spent €8 and i'm so glad i did.\n\nA thing you might think is a Con, is that it's highly inspiried by Hideo Kojima's Silent Hills P.T. In my case this is not a bad thing since i personally loved P.T. and there are certain scenes where it's just screaming "P.T.!" "P.T.!" "P.T.!" but i loved the game anyways.\n\nThis game classifies as Physological Horror and does it perfectly, this does not exclude the jumpscares, they are in the game, trust me. there are a few i could see coming but the rest came as a surprise and i loved it so much.\n\nTL;DR: Physological Horror inspired by P.T. and they did it amazingly well.","August 28, 2015","true","1.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

It throws you right into the meat of the game from the get go. The game is pretty short which I was glad about because the more you play it the less fear factor the game has. It is very repetative. I started off searching throw all the drawers and cabinents, but by the end of the game I was literally just running threw to get the expierence over with. The game plays exactly of the Silent Hills trailer, PT, and in some instances rips it off.    When the game tells you "Don't look behind you", if I remember correctly that scene is PT. Also, with the looping hallway that you have to turn backwards to get through it. Your dead wife haunting you.     After the first hour of gameplay the game has offered all of it's scare tactics. On the bright side, I did enjoy the story which was the only reason why I pushed myself through the played out gameplay. 6/10 I wouldn't pay full price for this game. It is enjoyable enough to pick it up an a sale or bundle.","February 28","false","2.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/detrucid/recommended/391720/","detrucid","Detrucid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/detrucid/","375 products in account","Before I write this review, I must declare that I am a fan of both horror games and of, uh, first-person non-combat adventure games (often cynically called "walking simulators"). I consider Silent Hill 2, the remake of Resident Evil and Eternal Darkness as some of the best games in the horror genre; I also consider Stanley Parable and The Vanishing of Ethan Carter - and even old-school puzzle games like Myst - as some of the most memorable gaming experiences of my life.\n\nObviously, Amnesia: The Dark Descent stands out as one of the greatest gaming experiments of the horror and first-person adventure, and the success of Amnesia following the well-received but obscure Penumbra series are a testament to how well these genres compliment each other. They have spawned numerous poor renditions in Steam's Greenlight section, and I have seen many attempts on Kickstarter to try and copy and improve upon this formula.\n\nLayers of Fear sits somewhere in between the two. It is a game that understands horror tropes and executes them well, but not horror fundamentals, and it uses its self-described "surrealism" and Hollywood schizophrenia to try and mask the fact that, at its core, Layers of Fear is a deeply flawed game.\n\nOne feels this when playing Layers of Fear: there are plenty of memorable scenes which, in the moment, are executed well in a beautiful fashion, but the pacing of these moments together feels at times comically ridiculous. What's lacking is tension and the build-up required for the execution of tension. Often, one moves from scene to scene where the expectation is fully present that this hallway will contain a jump scare, or that when I turn around from this locked door, the environment will have been changed. There is no subtlety to Layers of Fear because, as a linear experience, it is constructed more like salad, with plenty of delicious ingredients cut up and thrown together haphazardly. This surrealism is enjoyable because it does provide some moments where I audibly said "oh, that's ♥♥♥♥ing interesting"; however, what I wasn't thinking was "oh Christ, this is terrifying."\n\nWhat this surrealist salad also deprives the player of is any meaningful input in the game. As already stated, the lack of tension resulted in me inevitably just moving from scene to scene without feeling any consequence. But it also affects how the player interacts with each scene. Because the player is obviously insane (OR IS HE?), the game gets away with a lot of "surrealist" and "crazy" logic - that is, no logic at all. Practically, this resulted in me having no idea what the "trigger" was in many rooms to allow me to move forward and progress with the game. What spot do I stand in? Which light am I supposed to turn on? Why did this make the painting melt? Is that supposed to terrify me?\n\nThere are a few puzzles in this game which were enjoyable: the CAT DOG RAT puzzle, and many of the puzzles invoking the concept of time were rewarding because I had access to the logic of the scene I was embedded in. Many of them, however, feel like I just walk around and passively experience a bunch of imaginative stuff, interacting with everything in the room until I'm allowed to move on. There is a scene in which a hallway appears barricaded and I spent a good amount of time in the bathroom interacting with the basin and shower and toilet until I realised that I could simply move something blocking my path in the hallway. Why this barricade of simple objects but not other barricades made of simple objects? And why did I feel like I could just interact with a bunch of ♥♥♥♥ in the bathroom to be surrealistically pulled to the next impossible scene?\n\nUltimately, there is some creative reward for the designers intentionally obscuring this logic from the player in the visual design of the impossible scenes we experience, and I must reiterate that these scenes are incredibly memorable. But our interaction with the game is thwarted constantly and rewarded strangely. I don't feel rewarded by just interacting with everything in each scene; I feel alienated from the game because my actions result in nothing, or something, that I couldn't have anticipated. In this regard, as a player, I'm rarely being rewarded for any actual problem-solving, and it just turns into me clicking on everything and waiting for the game to tell me that we can move on.\n\nLayers of Fear is worth checking out because, creatively, it's an interesting experiment in first-person surreal impossibility in a manner similar to Antichamber. However, unlike Antichamber, one feels alienated from the experience, not an alienation that scares but one that breaks the player's investment in the game. In Amnesia, I felt tense and at risk for a majority of the game, completely immersed in the experience and involved as a player, but Layers of Fear gets some of the fundamentals of the horror genre wrong and fails to pull you in. This confusing involvement with the experience as a player in tandem with the constant barrage of horror moments without proper tension resulted in what I could only describe as a voyeuristic experience, and unfortunately, not an involving and immersive one.\n\nEDIT: The excuse of the prosthetic to alter the pace of the character's walking to sound like a heartbeat is actually ♥♥♥♥ing brilliant though.","February 19","false","2.7"," 24 of 51 people (47%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","47","24","51","2","0"

The paintings’ grotesque smiles seem to be aimed at me. Unsettling, calm music is playing from a gramophone somewhere upstairs. The door to the bathroom is half-open and I don’t really want to look inside. These are the first five minutes of Layers of Fear. These are the best minutes of Layers of Fear.\n\nThe game is packed full of horror clichés that were never too scary to begin with, and become less and less frightening every time they’re used. Sure, seeing a fractured porcelain doll once might be a bit weird. When the game is packed with them, at one point literally swarming with them, it’s just not effective. Any potentially effective scares are ruined by the fact that everything is fired off in a rapid succession, demonstrating a lack of understanding on what makes horror great. Most of the horror isn’t even the scare itself, it’s the buildup, waiting for something to happen. As Alfred Hitchcock once said, “There is no horror in the bang, only in the anticipation of it.” I couldn’t put it better myself.\n\nRead the full review at: http://techraptor.net/content/layers-of-fear-review","February 20","false","4.3"," 12 of 27 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","12","27","0","0"

The game's first 20 mins or so are interesting. You turn of the lights of your room, to get into the game and get ready for some jumpscare. Honestly...after the first jumpscare, everything in the game was predictable (almost). Maybe the end content of the game is good (sadly other guys who have played it, say it isn't) but the problem is you'll get bored playing this game much before that. After about 38 mins of playtime on steam, I really wanted to read the reviews of this game. And I agree with most of the negative reviews on the game. Despite that, I fail to understand why is the game "overwhelmingly positive"? I think some of these indie games are give aways etc, and people are asked to review them or something.

I highly recommend it , even though it is in Early Access, because I just know these guys are going to make this game a gem , and really, it already is. I just can't wait until the next addition and/or full release to arrive. This is one I'll play more than once or twice. Great job on this one.

Most linear game I've ever played, literally. This is no hyperbole, the game would shuffle you through a series of rooms and not even let you turn around because it would lock every door behind you and have the architecture change almost every time you turn around (so spooky). Bad lighting, too: I had to play in the dark not to increase the horror factor (of which there is none, and this comes from someone who cries when playing Silent Hill), but to be able to see anything. Finicky controls; closing the elevator door is really a ploy to give you carpal tunnel. It's unclear what items are interactive, forcing you to scroll randomly about the room.\n\nLong story short, you've experienced the game's full repetoire of tricks after an hour's play. $20 is a joke for the reasons outlined above, and I never even broached the ridiculously basic design of the house through which you roam. It reminded me of something I would create absent-mindedly as a child while playing Sims: Livin' It Up. I do feel obliged to say in the game's defence, especially after so damning a comment, that there was the occasional visual trick that is impressive.
