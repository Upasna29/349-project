"http://steamcommunity.com/id/OreOSCookie/recommended/327890/","OreOSCookie","OreOS","http://steamcommunity.com/id/OreOSCookie/","115 products in account","My opinion about the game overall:\nIf you were expecting a funny/punny review then you came to the wrong review. I decided to make an actual helpful/serious review for the game. Let me start off saying this is a really great game and is a real and serious game despite looking like a joke, back when I saw this game in Greenlight I laughed and gave it a vote expecting it to be a game that wouldn't even get to a full release, when it first came out my friend bought it so I went to his place and played it for a few hours, after playing it a few times I decided to buy i. Aas it got more and more updates it got better. A lot of people say the game is hard to play with a keyboard but I disagree, back when I first played the game I didn't have a controller so I played it with a keyboard, after a while, I got a controller, and the only thing that was hard about playing with a controller was that sometimes I got confused with the buttons' names, overall it's better with a controller. Awesome game, they really put a lot of work to it and listened to the community throughout the making of the game.\nCons and pros:\n+Remappable keyboard controls\n+Changable sensitivity\n+Graphic options also pretty customizable\n+Great graphics\n+Great support from the devlopers of the game in issues you might run into\n+Achievements\n-Controls can take time to get used to\n-New players can sometimes be annoyed by the game's challenge but that's pretty subjective\nGamemodes:\n\nStory mode: At the beginning of each level you are presented with some sort of letter about an insane guy who's also the house owner, you finish reading it or skip it and you then spawn as a  piece of bread at the start of the level, at some levels you have extras you can add to yourself like jam and butter which have some side effects. You travel through the level possibly using various objects on the way to eventually get to the toaster or pan or whatever else you want to fry yourself on, in most levels there is more than one way to toast yourself. You get a grade based on your edibility, tastiness and possibly your time but I'm not sure about that, grades are from A++ from F(you only get f if you didn't finish the level). Story mode is overall challenging and my personal favorite. There are 8 levels in the story mode game mode.\n\nBagel Race: In this gamemode you spawn as a bagel in a different spawn than your spawn points at Story Mode, you need to run through the map using 3 and 4 keys(by default assuming you're using the keyboard) and the mouse and pass through checkpoints on the way to the end, you get a grade based on how fast you completed the race. There are 8 levels in the bagel race game mode. You have no edibility in this game mode.\n\nRampage: In this game mode you play as a baguette. In this mode your goal is to cause as much damage as possible to various objects around the level, the more damage you cause the better grade you are gonna get. You have multiplier for everytime you smash a few things at once. You have no edibility in this game mode. Rampage has 8 levels. You have a time limit at this game mode.\n\nCheese hunt: In this game mode you play as a crackbread. In this game mode you spawn as crackbread and start wandering around to find cheese and touch it so it sticks to you, as far as I know there are 5 pieces of cheese in each level. you lose ediblity by falling and/or hitting something too hard. You have no time limit in this game mode. There are 8 levels to Cheese Hunt.\n\nZero G(ravity): In this game mode you play as a slice of bread. This game mode is pretty much the same as the regular gamemode only there isn't gravity and you need to fly around with jets attached to you. I cannot explain the controls to this game mode as they are very complicated to explain, the main difference from the main game mode is that your grade is also based off the amount of fuel you've used up(You have infinite fuel, you use up fuel when you use your jets). You have edibility in this game mode, you lose ediblity when you touch the floor as far as I know. There is no time limit in this game mode. There are 8 levels to Zero G(ravity).\n\nI'll edit this to explain about the gamemodes left soon.","May 22, 2015","true","53.4"," 1,006 of 1,130 people (89%) found this review helpful 191 people found this review funny","89","006","1","191","27"

I won’t. But I could.\n\n\n\n******************\n\n\nDue to popular demand Ive decided to add a more ‘wholemeal’ first look review for people who like that sort of thing.\n\nThe game is essential qwop combined with the floor is lava. You navigate your slice of bread around various obstacles on a quest to get yourself nicely toasted (insert your own joke there).  Encountering dirty items reduces your edibility and therefore your overall score, whilst getting smothered in tasty tasty jam boosts it.\n\nThe game controls exactly how you would imagine it does. Each corner is assigned a different button which when pressed holds that edge in place apparently regardless of the surface/physics. The mouse or thumb stick flicks the bread around of can be used to nudge it around for precise movements. Practiced or naturally skilled will surely be able to cartwheel their way onto the leaderboards quickly whilst people starting out will ultimately spend more time flailing around like a dying Magicarp. Your main opponent is your own frustration.\n\nIf the play style is sounding very familiar that’s because it is. Anyone who has already played Surgeon Simulator or Octodad will immediately recognise the pattern of destruction and failure. This means that behind its freshly baked exterior the game is likely to become stale fairly quickly. Like its sister games there is a big potential for fun workshop content but ultimately you cannot judge a game on what could possibly be made by fans later on.\n\nIt is worth pointing out that it is an early access game, meaning that it is essentially unfinished, although this game does feel a lot more complete than most. It is very much playable with the exception of a few minor bugs. Enabling the gif record mode makes the game basically unplayable and the music always seems to be coming out of a random corner of the room.\n\nI think overall most people will have already made a decision about this game, and whatever your thoughts they are probably correct. It’s ultimately a casual iPad-destined meme-maker but it clean fun and will give most people a few laughs for less than the price of an average cinema ticket. If flinging a slice of bread around for a few hours is the sort of thing that will brighten your day, then this is probably for you.","December 3, 2014","true","3.1"," 5,942 of 7,100 people (84%) found this review helpful 2,186 people found this review funny","84","942","7","186","400"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/varow/recommended/327890/","varow","(The Archangel) Varow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/varow/","593 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI started the day as a slice of bread. Not the end piece, because no one likes the end piece. No, I was the second slice in. I emerged from my loaf in glorious fashion, spreading my crumbs all over as I flew from what I once called home. This was the start of my journey.\n\nI emerged in to a world of culinary decadence. To my left was Mt. Butter, and to my right was Jelly Valley. There were so many places to see, so many things to do. Life had finally begun.\n\nI began my voyage to Toaster Kingdom by first heading for Mt. Butter. It was always a dream of mine to stand-atop the hills on Mt. Butter, and I did just that. I paraded to the top in mere seconds, only to slide down Mt. Butter and splash right in to Jelly Valley.\n\nIt was like a slip-n-slide of deliciousness.\n\nI emerged from Jelly Valley covered from bread to toe, only to come to the edge of the world. I could see it all from here; the vast landscapes of Breadland, the hills of Crumbilina, but most of all, I could see Toaster Kingdom, and I knew my journey was far from over.\n\nIn a moment of serenity, I took a giant leap of faith, and I floated through space and time, in an absolute moment of glory. I didn't know what was waiting for me below, but I knew this was what had to be done.\n\nFalling for what seemed an eternity, I thought this to be the end. Just then, something emerges below me, and I land softly on to a giant looking board with wheels. My savior.\n\nI thanked it for saving me, and we bonded very quickly. It turns out, we are both heading to the same destination, and he agrees to let me travel on him. I hold on tight, and off we go. We travel through canyons, wastelands, hell, we even traveled through large ravines.\n\nWe're almost there.\n\nWe arrive at the Counter-Top Haven. The final stop before Toaster Kingdom. Just when we are in-reach of the Toaster Kingdom, my new friend informs me that he can go no further, for he is not capable of climbing. He entrusts me with a gift for King Toaster, a serum of sorts. He called it Maple Syrup. I am clueless what it would be used for, after-all the King is french. I don't understand what he would possibly do with such a thing. Nevertheless, I say thank you for everything, as a tear of jelly starts rolling down my face, and I start my ascent to reach the top of Counter-Top Haven.\n\nIt's a rough climb. It takes me about a minute or two, as I seem to be slipping and sliding all over the cliffs and peaks of this place. Maybe it's the jelly, maybe it's the butter, but all's I know is that I must persevere. I must make it to Toaster Kingdom.\n\nI finally reach the top of Counter-Top Haven, and Toaster Kingdom and the Toaster King are in my line of sight. I flop towards them as fast as my nimble body can take me, battered and buttered and bruised. I reach the entrance to Toaster Kingdom. I can feel it now. I'm almost there. I only have to climb once more and I will have completed my first voyage.\n\nWith all the strength I can muster, I grip tightly on to the walls of Toaster Kingdom. I manage to hoist myself a-top this beautiful landscape. I'm here. I made it. The Toaster King is in sight. I just have to decend to the throne room, and I will have fulfilled my purpose in life.\n\nJust as I am readying myself to decend towards the king, a gust of wind blows me off of the top of the kingdom. Down I fly, past Counter-Top Haven. Below I go, to the ends of the earth. No one to save me this time. I fall. I fall.\n\nI land in the dirt.\n\nRuined.\n\nI wither and die.\n\n10 / 10. Would play again.","December 5, 2014","true","3.5"," 1,271 of 1,504 people (85%) found this review helpful 478 people found this review funny","85","271","1","478","58"

You use 1,2,3,4 to 'grab' onto a surface, then you swing yourself to move! The goal is to get to the toaster on the other side of the room, and to toast yourself. It's definitely not as simple as it sounds, though!\n\nIt's a fantastic game for its price. :>\n\n\nEDIT 12/04/14: I didn't expect this review to get so much attention, geez. x3\n\n\nA lot of people seem to be under the impression that it's free-play, and that there's no real goal or penalities, etc. I'll clear that up for you.\n\nThere's no sandbox mode yet. The only real limitation you have, is not touching the floor. If you do so, it'll drain your 'health bar'.\n\nThere are a couple of different levels. Even if you manage to complete them all, the replay value is high, as there's multiple ways to complete each level!\n\nDespite being early access, this game feels perfectly complete!

The game puts you in the place of a lone slice of bread, lost in a large house with no idea of how he got there or how to get out. It perfectly represents all of the horrors bread goes through on a daily basis, such as but no limited to:\n-Climbing on the wall\n-Sticking to a box of chips\n-Getting stuck in the aforementioned box of chips\n-Riding on a skateboard\n-Touching the floor\n-Playing Jenga\n-Falling from the top of a refridgerator into a sink\n-Touching the floor\n-Forgetting which sides LT and RT are on\n-Doing cartwheels\n-and touching the floor.\n\nThis game has no jumpscares, but has enough tension to make you go crazy. You'll constantly be thinking things like "OH GOD I'M STUCK ON THE FLOOR! WHY CAN'T I STICK TO THE SKATEBOARD!?! LET ME ON THE SKATEBOOAAAARD!!!!" and feeling true terror nearly all the time.\n\nI give it a Potato out of Rye. Really a must play.\nAre you ready for Breaddy?","December 6, 2014","true","1.3"," 131 of 164 people (80%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","80","131","164","11","0"

That will kill the edibility of the bread.\n\nHowever trying to steer this bread or moving it it's extremly tedious... i HATE the controll sceme (I tried both Keyboard and Gamepad (xbox controller)  It's very hard and takes tons of time to get used with the controls.\n\nI spend over 18-25 minutes on the first level... trying to get this bread toasted.  it's very hard but managedable with a bit of cursing with tears in my eyes. the second level is even worse and i don't even want think about the rest.\n\n\nThen again i see how no other control sceme would work for this game.\n\n\nWhat i like:\n* Grapichs and physics\n* Fun to break stuff and climb onto things.\n\nWhat i hate:\n* How you control the bread...\n* How there was NOT any free roam/free play from the start where you can just mess around without having to worry about the floor.\n\n\nSo there you have it.\n\nIf they where kind enough to add a free roam to the game from the start where you could have a little fun i would be very pleased and give it a YES.\n\nBut it seems you have to spend hours on trying to get toased and move on the next day, no idea if they will reward you with a free roam function.\n\nThis is an early review of the game and i might change it later.\n\nFor now, i do not recommend this game. to tedious.\n\nEDIT:\n\nI am not a hater of the game, as many comments below state.\nI know these type of games and i'm very femiliar with the Surgon simulator which is also very hard on the controlls.\n\nThe idea is brilliant and the concept is fun and adoring, and i'm a working male who plays video games in my spare time and i'm quite the good player on most games, and i'm not "bad" just because i can't get passed day two.  It's early access and they want to listens to people's good and bad reports of it.\n\nI'm just saying the game show no remorse for a simple mistake. You fall, you die. Restart and spend another 25-30 minutes getting through the level.\n\nDon't take my word for it, read other people's negative reviews, they will state the same.\n\nPeople who says "I'm a bread, got jelly on me and fell face down. 12/10" is a part of this new "funny steam review" trend and don't take the game all to seriosly.\n\n\nThanks to people who actually cared for my review!","December 3, 2014","false","7.4"," 1,116 of 1,609 people (69%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","69","116","1","20","64"

What is this wonderous feeling? for the first time, I wiggle my left corner... then my right... how? How is this possible? I squint around with my new found sight. At first the images make no coherent sense to me, colors and shapes swim before my eyes in a dance of choatic inanity. It seems to me that I am watching honey bear take supper with a family of badgers and a pair of rather snobish french ducklings. I see a butterfly flutter past, and my eyes follow it only to see it stop to perch on a Loaf of Bread....\n...could it be?\nsurely my eyes must still be decieving me! but alas, as I peruse my surroundings for a second time I see nothing but a filthy kitchen with half empty bottles laying at random across the room. The counter top appeared to be overrun by a hoard of disgusting ants, and the table upon which I was laying seemed to have a Loaf of Bread sitting right in the middle, OF WHICH I WAS NOT A PART OF!\nI gasped in horror\nIT WASN'T TRUE!\nit couldn't be!\nI? Seperated from my Loaf?\nI retreated within my self TRYING to regain the calm sense of quiet colaboration from which I was so violently torn!\nsure enough, I could no longer regain contact with my brethren.\nMy soul despaired.\nbut I am not one to sit and loaf about in a bad situation. I gripped the surface of the table with all of my might and flung myself headlong toward the edge. I peered over, shuddering to my self at the sight of the pathogen sullied floor a few feet below. I gazed across the gap at my destination, Took a moment to steele myself for the gravity defying leap, dug my corners into the table and pushed against it with such a force that it sent me careening into the air! There was a fleeting moment of despair as I realized that I would miss my intentended target, but I quickly regained my concentration to find a solution to my predicament. As I soared past the chair between the table and countertop, I managed to just grab the top with my left corner. For a moment I thought I was safe, but as I clung to the chair, it began to tip. Slowly at first, but then faster, and FASTER! I feared it would fall to the floor and crush me beneath its weight, but in mid fall the top of the chair hit the edge of the counter top... and stayed there! This was brilliant! I hoisted myself up from my precarius perch and up to the counter top just as the last of my grip strength ran out. I lay there gasping for breath as I let my tired corners rest. But it was no more than a minute or two's respite before I was compelled to flee from the newest danger of my harrowing journey. The ants. They ran on to me climbing up my white and fluffy sides as I tried hopelessly to shake them off. I could feel my precious edibility dropping as the ants crawled up and down my quivering body. I threw myself recklessly across the counter and began to climb the huge white expanse that was the refridgerator. As I climbed I began to feel better, as the ants were shaken off and hurled to their doom at the floor below. With a sudden realization I thought to myself that maybe... just maybe, this transformation from Loaf to Slice was a good thing! I was unlike any of my kind, I could move, I could breathe, I could SEE! I COULD HEAR! As I flipped myself over the top of the fridge I spied my destiation in the distance. A small, shiny metal toaster. Though the journey was far from over I knew it would be worth it, and I had many a reason to be encouraged. I was by all means, incredible! The soul triumph of NATURE! A GOD AMONG MY PEOPLE!!! I gaze at the lands over which I WILL NO DOUBT RULE!!!! and I find comfort in the fact that ....one day! I shall rule ALL GRAINS!!! every BAGEL and BAGUETTE!!! because from this moment on I AM KING!\n\nI... AM...

Almost every one of them is nothing but stupid bread related puns. Don't trust the user rating.\n\nSeems like it's just another "zany" game now that the goat simulator hype has died down.\nPeople who enjoy "teh randumbs" will probably enjoy this game, but I didn't personally enjoy this title after going through the first level.\nThe game is quite simple. You try to guide a piece of bread across the room to a toaster and toast yourself inside of it. while trying to keep your "freshness" as high as possible without touching things like trails of ants or the floor..\nHowever, in my opinion, the physics are just awful. I would much rather the bread have QWOP's physics system than the system it has now. A problem I constantly run into is the bread not turning the right way, not properly turning, or just not turning at all.\nAll in all, it may seem like a good purchase just because of how out there the game is, but you'll probably regret it after putting it down about 10 minutes later.","December 4, 2014","false","0.9"," 267 of 381 people (70%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","70","267","381","13","29"

It seemed quirky, sandbox-y, and hopefully enjoyable, and the reviews seemed to be overall positive.  It couldn't all have been just people rating it highly, just because you're playing as bread, right?  This had to be actually fun!  However, having now given this game a try, I can say that it doesn't live up to the hype at all.\n\nFirst, I should state, from the trailers, it would seem like the game takes place in a sandbox-type game style.  Run around, cover yourself in crud, do stupid stuff, etc.  Tons of fun, right?  Well, if you're looking for that kind of gameplay, you've come to the wrong place, currently.  Perhaps when the game is more developed, there will be a free-play mode, but currently, there is only an objective mode, wherein you must make it from one side of the kitchen to the other, and toast yourself.  Still sounds fun, right?  Now, I imagine you may be sitting there going, "At least you can cover yourself in all sorts of stuff!"  Except, you can't, or your edibility bar hits zero and you get a game-over.  "Well, I can still climb all over the place, and swing from shelf to shelf like some gluten-based Tarzan, right?"  Well, bad news, you've only got a limited grip gauge that very quickly depletes, and you need to let it recharge again before you can grab anything, once it runs out.  Anddd when you hit the floor, your edibility quickly drops, as well.  I'm sure that, as it's early access, some of these issues will probably be addressed, but at this point, the trailers look much better than the game is.\n\nStill, you know what?  That could still be a fun, challenging game.  Could be.  That is, if not for what me be perhaps the worst problem with this game: the contols are just awful.  And no, I don't mean like Surgeon Simulator's "haha this is hilarious" awful, I mean "why is the mouse suddenly inverted?  It didn't move like this before.  Why is it not responding to my movements?!" awful.  Seemingly at random, the game decides that you're now pulling back when you're pushing forward, swinging left when pulling right, etc., and then, at the drop of a hat, decides to go back to normal again.  Usually while you're climbing the walls with your quickly depleting grip gauge, or trying to finagle your way into the toaster slot, resulting in you either falling to the floor (at which point, the process repeats until your health edibility bar hits zero) or you flinging the toaster down to the floor, where toasting is not really an option (again, inevitably resulting in the edibility gauge hitting zero, but even more heartbreaking is victory is wrested from your fingers.  Er... Crust?).  If these controls didn't decide at random not to work, perhaps I could have had fun.  Perhaps this could have been a worthwhile game.  However, as it stands, the game is not challenging, it is just downright frustrating, and it is NOT worth your money.  Wait for them to improve the handling (if they ever do).","December 4, 2014","false","2.0"," 113 of 171 people (66%) found this review helpful 36 people found this review funny","66","113","171","36","1"

The main story is a fully immersive action, adventure, 3D platformer, roleplaying puzzle game with unexpectedly dark twists in the story.  It is truly an emotional roller coaster as you hang on for dear life, inches away from safety, flinging yourself upward with the little strength you have left in a desperation, only to fall to a painful death, alone, far from loaf of your family, on the cold hard floor.  Then you try again, and again, as frustration and you question whether it is even possible to reach you goal is this cruel world.  The feeling of accomplishment after finally succeeding makes it all worth it.  You learn, if a piece of bread can overcome all the odds and become toast, you might have a chance at succeeding in life too, if you stop playing this addicting game and go live it.  You also learn that alcohol compounds psychological issues.\n\nThere is more to this bread simulator than the main story.  I was pleasantly surprised to unlock a thrilling time-trial racing simulator, a very realistic and somewhat more calming space exploration simulator, a destroy everything simulator, and even an annoying fetch-quest simulator.

It's a lovely novel concept, the story (yes, there is one) is pretty good, and the level design ranges from open and flexible to linear and ♥♥♥♥ WHOEVER MADE THIS. Mercifully, there is a Super Guide equivalent to let you get through any level at the expense of a forced E rank, although even with that in place you can still be hard pressed to figure out how to toast yourself.\n\nI realize that the game is fumblecore at its heart, but it often seems to demand just a bit too much for what you can feasibly do with its unique blend of A) the controls, B) the physics, and C) the camera. The controls in and of themselves are generally manageable, but when attempting to swing like Bread Tarzan across a string of 6 or so sunflowers and the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ cocking things are just flailing about as though in a typhoon because of arbitrary WACKY physics, the game just starts to fall apart. If you manage to smash open a jam jar to coat yourself, you can spend a full couple of minutes wrestling with all of the broken glass trying to actually make contact with the jam -- and once coated it can actually make movement much more challenging, to the point that you'll be unable to detach from a surface until you've swiveled the camera to an angle where the controls feel like cooperating, assuming the camera also cooperates and doesn't get stuck inside a wall pointing at the ceiling. When levels last upwards of 10 minutes and have no checkpoints, getting dicked to death by the camera and/or how it interacts with the controls is not a fun experience. The epilogue took me 5 tries alone; once because it was my fault, three times in a row because the physics made my bread clip into the car and spaz out, the third time ending with me launching into space at infinite velocity.\n\nThere's only a handful of levels in total but a few different modes to play them in and a standing possibility of more post-release content for free and/or as DLC. All in all I enjoyed it, but the physics and camera still definitely need work, and due to the prolonged format of the levels as compared to Surgeon Simulator, it's just a much more frustrating experience as a whole.\n\nAs a final caveat, none of the achievements seem to work yet either.","April 12, 2015","true","4.1"," 39 of 51 people (76%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","76","39","51","13","0"

There's no tutorial and no on-screen hints to guide your progress, but a little bit of exploration will make the control scheme clear - you can grab with any combination of corners at once, and nudge, flip or fling yourself toward furniture or objects scattered about the room.\n\nSometimes the physics of interactive objects gets a little wonky; grabbing onto an object as it topples may sometimes hurl you in an unexpected direction, but the simulation is pretty solid otherwise. Hazardous elements of the environment are left for the player to discover; surfaces or objects that decrease the bread's "ediblility", hurting your score and eventually causing you to fail the level.\n\nSucceeding at becoming toast unlocks a new room and a little more of the backstory, hinting at a larger meaning beyond finding a way to brown oneself. The novelty of the concept and the control scheme make a simple game very enjoyable and eminently replayable.","February 2, 2015","true","8.3"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","22","24","3","0"

I'd reccomend changing it so that the arrow keys move in relation to where the camera is facing, and WASD are fixatedly assigned to a corner, and overlap each other the further away they are from the camera.\n\nAlso, the camera has the sensetivity of my rib cage being perforrated by the fingers of someone with anorexia. Even the slightest movement will cause it to jerk 180, and if you were grabbing onto something good luck getting where you were planning on going before you fall to the floor with the (at least what I interpreted) message "♥♥♥♥ you thats what you get for trying to rotate the camera".\n\nAlso, the trailer is very misleading. While it advertises a simple game that tells the tale of a slice of bread on its quest to become toasted, when you get in game you get a happy upbeat song to the tune of a level whose traversability resembles that of a poorly made game with graphics that don't match the lacking quality of the level. The Jenga blocks are evil and you will get stuck on them because you're a loaf of bread with a big area and those jenga blocks don't leave much room on either side for you to pass.\n\nYou are virtually immobile when not grabbing onto something, and I think that is just stupid. Grabbing should be a method to assist you to get from A to B, not be the only way to do it. Just have the bread flip and timble according to what edges/surfaces are touching what and in what direction the bread is travelling.\n\nFinally, make getting past the fridge easier. If you try to go up it you'll run out of grip before you realise there is no space at the top to climb over, and if you try to go in front of it you'll realise that the cubbard handles protrude so much that the stale bread you represent cannot bend the majority of its body mass around the corner of a fridge ever so slightly to grip the recessed area of the cubbard, which if you didn't know is basically everything except the handles.\n\nI said it once and I will say it again, stay away from the cubbard because it will ♥♥♥♥ you up.\n\nFirst level needs some SERIOUS rebalancing, music is too upbeat, camera is on steroine and the controls are aparaplegic.\n\nThose problems need to be fixed fast, because thats not how you add challenge to a game, thats how you make it unplayable, a hugely unappealing game, and a waste of €8.","December 3, 2014","false","0.8"," 96 of 159 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","96","159","2","2"

'I am Bread' is one of the most moronic things ever created. It's a stupid little game where you play as a piece of bread and you have to toast yourself. That's it. The controls are absolutely terrible and the game is extremely difficult. This game is in very single way shape and form a piece of garbage. Which is exactly why you should buy it. You get to play as bread. If that doesn't appeal to you, then you're a sick and disgusting human being. As for the game being unplayably hard, that's the whole point of the game. No one said being a piece of bread was easy. No one really ever said it was hard, either, but they never said it was easy. This game is exactly what it was made to be. A stupid yet challenging game about being a damn slice of bread. I paid $8.49 to be a piece of bread. I'd pay it again if I could, it's that good. If you're the kind of person that thinks being a slice of bread would be fun, buy this game right now. If you're not that kind of person, then go kick puppies into a river or do whatever else it is that you party-poopers do.\n\n"12/10 would bread again." John C.

The challenge in I am Bread doesn't come from the gameplay, or the missions, or the success conditions, but instead from fighting with the controller to do what you want it to do. If the player fails it should be due to his or her actions, not because the game decides to work against their inputs.\n\nThe humour of the game wears off quickly and it isn't enough to carry the frustration that comes from the core gameplay. Rampage mode is a nice option and serves as pure catharsis. I would actually be more interested in playing a fully-fleshed out Katamari Damacy style game with the rampage mechanics.\n\nOverall, probably worth a try but I wouldn't pay full sticker price.","March 11","false","2.6"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","18","22","0","0"

Although the first level seems simple, there are multiple ways to achieve your goal, all with varying difficulty. You have to maintain your edibility level otherwise it's game over, because who the ♥♥♥♥ wants to eat a piece of toast covered in dirt and ants? You can also make yourself more delicious, if you so desire. Past the first level, the ways to become toast aren't exactly the most obvious, so you will spend time exploring the room and finding creative ways to reach toasty nirvana.\nThe controls can be tricky to handle, and that's half the fun.. and all of the frustration. Although you can use your keyboard, using a controller is much simpler (assuming you can discern your left and right, otherwise it can be more frustrating).\n\nOverall, it's a stupidly fun game.

Even though there are 4 levels in the game right now, I have fun playing them over again. (First level is the best :D).\n\nThere are a lot of comments about how the controls aren't very good. They are 1, 2, 3, and 4 for gripping, and q,w,e, and r for locking the grip. Left click mouse to swing the bread, and right click to move the camera. I find the controls quite good actually. I got used to the controls really quickly despite everything else.

The controls are filled with freedom, I can put all sorts of muscle memory into these eight keys, allowing for quick, situation based reactions. I have just unlocked the second level but can not yet locate the toaster, I have scouted one half of the room, and soon I will check out the other. I am Bread has not yet gone stale, and I feel I could enjoy it for flours on end. It is enjoyable for me not only because of the challenge, but there is the fun appeal of being a bread, I'm not sure why but I feel as though I have always wanted to play as bread in a game. Luckily this isn't any sort of fake game like goat simulator, and I am excited to see what kinds of updates that could be in the future. The resolution settings are customizable like most games in case if the bread starts to look too grainy, and if you just barley make it to the toaster, but hit the ground, you have to wait until the next growing season.by playing this game I have reaped the rewards of being entertained and have recieved a hunger for bread.\n\nAfter level two--------------------\nOf course, I should've known, level two's toaster is  actually not a toaster. Apparently the game has some secrets up it's sleeve, hopefully it won't stump me for long next time. this game is just a sheaf of fun. On top of the controls, puzzles! Although maybe I was just too mesmerized by the bread to notice what wasn't intended to be a puzzle. Even if this game doesn't become the best or come out fully cooked, it plows the way for more innovative game designs. I thought I would do a short paragraph per level but realized I'd probably best slice the bread and cut to the chase. Sadly I could not part with all these puns.\n\nPROS\nhard\nGood controls (so much muscle memory to be had)\nSentient Bread\ninsane homeowner\nBushels of variety\n\nCONS\nno multiplayer\n\nTL;DR\nIf you like a hard game, and need some muscle memory fun, this is your game.","December 4, 2014","true","7.7"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","14","18","0","0"

The controls are extremely confusing and frustrating.  Only once have I been able to get to the countertop in the first stage, and it was through sheer luck that I did it.\n\nThe major problem I have is that climbing (or navigating at all) is not as simple as "point in the direction you want to go".  Numerous times, while wishing to scale the walls, I would press "up" on the controller (or keyboard, which is a bigger nightmare to use), and my bread would go down.  I would then press down, and my bread would move about half way, and be perpendicular to the wall.  Then, instead of pressing "up" at this point, I would have to rotate the stick 180 degrees around, and finally I could move forward.\n\nThe game seems fun, but the control is extremely complex.  For a game like QWOP, which was a silly Flash game with no real purpose, this control scheme would be fine.  But this game seems to have multiple levels, each with varying levels of difficulty.  It's because of the control alone, and I can't recommend this game.\n\nAt the very least, there should be an option to add in a simplified control, or to remap buttons.  Perhaps a less strict grip meter?  Make the floor not eat away at your edibility by just being stationary, but when you move?\n\nI understand this game is in early access, so I'm not being overly critical of it.  I do hope these "problems" are fixed though.  If they remain, I may not be able to play this game as I simply don't have the mental dexterity to handle it.","December 5, 2014","false","0.4"," 36 of 60 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","36","60","0","0"

Yes and no is the simple answer. The more elaborated answer is a bit more... complicated.\n\nYes, I recommend it because:\n\n+ The ultimate challenge for your patience\n+ wonderful, playful music\n+ nice graphics\n+ excellent idea\n\nBut I don't recommend it because:\n\n- It's way too hard and unforgiving for its own good (imho).\n- Short soundtrack - all though lovely, I only played like 70 minutes, and I already got tired of the soundtrack\n\n\nI want to comment a little bit more elaborated on the "too hard for its own good"-point here. I know this game is supposed to be hard, and I know it is the ultimate challenge. But in my opinion there are too many factors that makes you fail in order for this to be fun to play. Prior to ordering this game, I was just thinking that people were too bad gamers and soar loosers for down-voting this game due to its controls and being too hard. But now I understand them.\n\nIt is hard enough to master navigating the bread; but once you learn that it's quite simple. HOWEVER, what I cannot grasp is why the most difficult aspect of this game is to get into the God forsaken toaster??? You've just been through hell to get to the toaster, and then you simply cannot get into the bloody thing. On the first story mission I mastered my skills to get to the toaster in like 3 - 4 minutes, which is quite good considering I just bought the game. But then you are rewarded by having to spend another 5 minutes to get the bread to actually go into the toaster. And that blew a fuse for me.\n\nThe second thing that makes this game too difficult is how unforgiving it is; not only do you loose edibility (health), but also have a grip-counter which is way too short/small considering how you are sometimes supposed to hang above the floor infront of a grill in order to become toasted.\n\nIt is also not rewarding enough. The grading scale in the end is way too demanding, which more often than not sends out a vibe that "Hey, You suck ballz!". I mean, I don't expect an A-grading for completing a mission in 10 minutes, but a D when I lost no health at all? That is just mean.\n\nSo how to "fix" this game in my opinion? Make it a bit more forgiving; don't make it so difficult to get into the toaster after all the hell getting to the toaster, indicate WHAT is the toaster (it is difficult enough to get to it, you should not have to search for WHAT is the toaster), and make the toast more responsive to your controlls.\n\nAll in all: If you like to torture yourself, and/or have an incredible amount of patience, this game is for you. The concept is brilliant. But considering the immense difficulty of the game I would not recommend this for the weak-minded (I guess I am a weak-minded gamer in this sense).\n\nMy final verdict is a 7/10 for being a brilliant concept with good graphics and being a game that really stays true to its intended gameplay. But NO, I don't recommend this, unless you have some serious nerves of steel and is serious about sitting hours just to get through one or two levels of the game.\n\n","March 28","false","1.2"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","11","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/recommended/327890/","SamuraiVader","Samurai Vader","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/","4009 products in account","I am Bread is a third Steam game by Bossa Studios who are known thanks to their crazy Surgeon Simulator. If you've already seen (or played) the game, you know it challenges players by having difficult controls that makes it frustrating but also hilarious to play. In this case, they did it in pretty similar way, with important difference: You will be in control of a slice of bread that wants to get toasted. (A great potential friend for toaster from Red Dwarf!)\n\nYes, it's a weird physics simulation game where you are trying to move bread towards a source of heat. Controls revolves around four buttons - a button for each bread's corner that makes it sticky. If you are now thinking about the movement, you have probably already thought out that all the movement is done by swinging and flinging on those stickied bread corners.\n\nI can't say it would be unexpected after Surgeon Simulator, but it's still important to say that I am Bread is a difficult game. It has a high level of difficulty, you'll be raging a lot because while you'll be trying to get to get toasted (by toaster or table lamp, for example), you'll also have to dodge all dirty and wet areas and objects. Don't even think about touching ground! It's like the floor is lava, it makes you taste bad which leads up to the game over screen. And one more thing, you have limited "sticky timer". You can hold on some place swinging just for a moment, then you have to lay somewhere to regain your energy for being sticky.\n\nWhile it's definitely a great game for skilled speedrunners, don't expect to get into it easily, you'll need a lot of practice to beat levels without getting dirty. Good thing is that the developers knew how begineers will suck at it, so after two times you lose a level, you'll get an option to remove the sticky timer and edibility meter (edibility is reduced by getting dirty).\n\nThe main story mode offers a classic level list with funny short story, delivered via medical reports, about a man who gets crazy because he thinks that a slice of bread is destryoing everything in his house. But there's more! There's also a cheese hunt, bagel race (probably the easiest game mode), rampage (where you have to destroy everything with baguette), zero-g (to make you even more frustrated), and free play mode.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that developers made a lot of free content for I am Bread later after release - Team Fortress 2 bread level, Goat Simulator mode (just change bread for goat) and Starch Wars mode, which is a kind of weird 3D space shooter with laser bread (referencing Star Wars, of course). Even if it's been done with the idea of cross brand marketing, I really appreciate that those updates came up for free!\n\nThe game supports keyboard and mouse or gamepad controls. While other players had problems with controllers, I played with Xbox 360 controller without any problem, haven't seen any lag through my gameplay sessions.\n\nConclusion:I am Bread is a perfect game for those who want something silly but difficult. It requires a lot of practice to get good at it, so depending on your perseverance, it can offer you many hours of entertainment and huge self-satisfaction in the end... or a lot of frustration. So it depends on your temper, but it's definitely worth buying.\n\n\nFor more reviews, join Samurai Vader's Point of View group and follow my curator page, I'm always happy to see feedback about my reviews.","March 19","true","5.7"," 16 of 24 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","16","24","2","0"

This is a masterpiece well worth your time.\n\nCONTROLS:\nFirst of all, personally I like the control system.  For the main story mode hold down a button to select a bread corner, then move it in the direction you want it to go.  Sure there is a short learning curve, but I find climbing and navigating the world with these kinds of control schemes very enjoyable.  The gifs you will find posted by the master players on the community hub are a joy to behold.  Don't be afraid.  Give it a go!\n\nIf the controls still bother you there are plenty of game modes, (including a free roam mode) starring different characters who are mostly easier to control than a bread slice.\n\nGameplay:\nThe variety is what makes this game stand out against most joke simulators.\nThere is plenty to do, and the game isn't reliant on humour to succeed.\n\nYou can enjoy a Star Wars parody, you can hunt for cheese, you can race baguettes, and you can plate up the dirtiest piece of bread you have ever seen with a smile on your face after skateboarding through dust, ants and falling in the dish water.\n\nThis is a unique fun game that deserves a chance.

I knew as I got older, games would get better, better physics, better gameplay, graphics, etc. I knew that playing these new "next-gen" games I would gain new perspectives.\n\nI never thought I would see in my life something like this. It's a truely amazing experience.  I am experiencing kitchen physics that are so realistic. As for the gameplay, what can I say, the fact that you play as a slice of bread is enough. The graphics? I literally feel as if I'm a piece of bread. I dream of being toasted, I want to contain my edibility, and I started to ride skateboards, just as the piece of bread does in this amazing game. I am seeing life from the perspective of a slice of bread.\n\nI would recommend this bread simulator to anyone who is longing for something as I always had: the experience of being a slice of bread. This game makes dreams come true. Please buy this game now. I give this 66/6 Would Dough that again.

With a controller, the game is pretty manageable. It's also a very fun and entertaining game, without a doubt. It's like Goat Simulator, but with bread. BREAD.\n\nIf you like little quirky, fun, somewhat challenging, and bizzare games, this definately is well worth it. Now, I got it on sale for $8.49, and I believe $10 may be a bit much. For a game that's early access and is still somewhat buggy at times, I believe it's worth around $7.50. None the less, I reccomend this game if you like something you can ♥♥♥♥ around in.\n\nOnce again, this game is almost made as a joke. Not implying that it's bad, but it's one of those jokes that in the past people would make fun of. "HAH! Who'd want to play a game where you're a slice of bread?" Apparently alot of people.\n\nKEEP IN MIND that the goal in this game is to become toast. By any means necessary. Be it Toaster or Radiator, your goal is to become toast.\n\n---\n\nNow i'll note why I believe the keyboard / mouse controlls are wonky.\n\nTo grip onto things, you have 1,2,3, and 4. To grab things, you have Q,W,E, and R. To look around, you use Right Click, and to move around, you use Left Click. I believe this control scheme could have been improved in some fassion. Such as look around being locked onto the cursor.\n\nSo ways I think they could improve the mouse & keyboard controlls;\n\n1. Make the camera snap to the cursor, so you look around by moving the mouse.\n\n2. Use a control layout that's a little bit more natural, for instance;\n---When I place my left hand on my keyboard, my fingers naturally will rest on (From left to right); Left Shift, A, W, D and the Space Bar.\n---A Good Idea would be to change it from 1234 to LShift, A, D, and Space Bar, using W for push away from camera and S for being pull towards the camera (Or the direction that the camera is facing).\n---Another way to change the control scheme, is to do what's listed above, but change the camera look from mouse to arrow keys. This would make gameplay better on laptops, and users who prefer playing with a keyboard.\n\nThe game is in early access, so again, things will change over time. Hopefully the controlls for keyboard/mouse will become more naturall over time.\n\nAside from that, I do reccomend this fun quirky little game.","December 3, 2014","true","12.0"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

In the tiny feet of a diminutive prince, players were tasked with picking up whatever random crap was strewn around a room/house/neighborhood/city/planet as fast as you can.  It was strange, yet strangely compelling; an oddity of video games that came out of nowhere and has since been milked dry as a concept; even the original creator has distanced himself from the series.  Weird games slowly drift by the wayside as video games break way into the mainstream, and things become normal.\n\nThen, in 2015, players were tasked with playing as a slice of bread.\n\nBossa Studios, the creators of Surgeon Simulator 2013, bring us yet another bizarro creation.  As a single slice of bread, your mission in I am Bread is to get toasted by any means necessary.  Gripping the surfaces and objects around you with the corners of your bread slice (somehow…), you must traverse the various rooms of a house to find that sweet embrace of heat that will get you nice and crispy.  But don’t land anywhere gross or linty!  Otherwise you’ll end up inedible, and what will even be the point of being toasted?  The horror of such a thought!\n\nI am Bread is utter nonsense baked into a bizarre, fluffy bun.  Yet the gameplay is so fun and goofy, oftentimes creating some of the best accidentally funniest moments of any game released this year.  Purposefully frustrating controls leave the player pulling out their hair one moment and laughing the next.  There’s no escaping it.  You are bread.  And you will be toast, one way or another.

That's one thing if I'm holding like an empty box, but a metal lamp? Few things behave like you expect them to, making each level less of a physics sandbox/puzzle and more of a trial and error hellscape. The final straw is the controls: mouse+kb is almost unusable, but you can rebind the keys, while a gamepad works pretty well, but is not rebindable -- so have fun with the god-awful default binds: you have to keep your fingers on the triggers *and* bumpers the whole time. This basically limits your gameplay time to 10-20 minutes, as any more than that will turn your hands into arthritic claws permanently.\n\nThere are things to like about this game, but I wouldn't recommend spending more than $5 on it, and only then if you have a soft spot for goofy physics games. If they ever patch the physics to be less broken, it could be great, but as it stands, the physics are just too unpredictable.","May 30, 2015","false","4.6"," 20 of 35 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","20","35","0","0"

The people who made this game also made Surgeon Simulator. It too is a wacky but functional simulator with unique mechanics.\n\nYou are a slice of bread meant to become toast by using the map to heat up your slice. That is a goal, something real games have. Goat Sim's only progression is racking up points. In I Am Bread, each level begins with a psychiatrist's diagnosis card. That's a story. It seems that the owner of the house believes that somebody is breaking into his home, destroying his things, and leaving one single slice of toast. As you play the game, you will see what happens to the guy.\n\nI Am Bread is a good game with minimal bugs and a lot of features and puns since it got out of early access.

Most end up just being one trick ponies and gimmick-a-thons. And the few decent ones end up being more like physics toys than actual games (Looking at you Turbo Dismount).\n\nI am Bread turns out to be an actual GAME rather than a toy. It's challenging, strategic and most importantly fun to play.\n\nThe game is rather short. Right now there are 4 levels, each of which you could beat in 5 minutes (you won't, but you could). It took me 3 hours to complete. Might take a little longer if you choose to explore more.\nMost levels have alternate routes and if that's not enough you could just scoot along the ceiling.\n\nI've seen people complain about the controls, and I admit, the keyboard controls are pretty horrofic, so I suggest you use a controller. Learning and mastering the controls is the main challenge.\nYou start out clumsily flopping around, smashing everything your way. And by the end you'll be making flips from wall to wall like a preschooler on acid.\n\nCons mostly consist of some unwarranted failures due to wonky physics knocking over a toaster you desperately need. The learning curve is pretty harsh too. And the lack of real tutorial can be an issue if you get frustrated easily.\n\nOverall. The game if real fun. It didn't feel samey and I can't wait for more to come.\nA nod to the developers for showing us that a dumb game doesn't have to be braindead.","December 4, 2014","true","4.8"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

"I'm so in," sucker me said. I fork out the asking price, start up and am impressed by the settings options better than some games. Choose controller option, then realize I can't navigate menus (including restarting) with my controller still need mouse for that, not fun annoyed starts. Ok start playing, controller seems way better then keyboard and OMG, I'm controlling a piece of bread go me... but soon I realized the controls are about 10 times more horrible then surgeon simulator, the collision detection is horrible, collision detection can also be influenced by camera angles, and the camera angels are forced and hard to get a decent line of sight. Furthermore the lacking camera angles prevent you from being able to see the level and the game lacks a free roam mode with no edibility so you can explore.\n\nI have played early access games thinking this has potential, however I feel this game isn't even developed to the point where you can tell yet. Also the question "how do you control a piece of bread?", was not answered very well by the devs. Until I see some major improvements in playability I would not recommend this game!\n\nIf in the future this game does improve, I will update my review.\n\nUPDATE:\nSo since my original review the game has receiceved quite a bit of content and polish.\nOf the content I enjoyed the startch wars, the controls were actually playable but couldn't figure out what to do after destroying three weak points on the main ship. I gave up on the bagel race but felt like the rampage control where pretty good. I also found 0-gravity mode fun but sill nearly impossible to controll, there was cheese hunt and free roam but those are thing I only do with my girl friend so I didn't give them a shot. I tried tutorial mode and it took my a minute to realize they disabled the joystick in tutorial mode which really made me think why!? am I alway suposed to be controlling my bread with the d-pad? The other thing I realized was that the menus are still not fully navigatable with a controller so overall I just can't recommend this game to people, the video makes it look like fun but then you play it's just too difficult to enjoy the experience.","December 8, 2014","false","5.6"," 112 of 215 people (52%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","52","112","215","4","4"

Going in I really didnt expect much because I felt that there could not be much to do in the game. Boy was I wrong, this is a solid game. Its not just another surgeon sim or goat sim. There are lots of stuff to do with all the game modes and great enviroments. Its a tricky, tough game that doesnt ♥♥♥♥ you off when you mess up and go back to the beginning because its so fun I really didnt care. I played the first story mission for a little over an hour even when I had already beat it because I wanted to see other ways I could do to beat it.

In fact, it's designed to be hard to master, just like its predecessor 'Surgeon Simulator'. The difference this time, though, is that you yourself are not in a fixed position. Also you are a slice of bread. This lends to some awkward hand-eye mishaps and equally awkward doughy propulsion. Eventually you get the hang of it and start cartwheeling and breadboarding all over the place. Once you figure out basic movement, you can conquor any environment. I have come to write this review shortly after beating all of the available campaign, and I plan on trying to get higher scores than straight Fs and Ds.\n\nThe health system of the game, I think, is actually great. It is 'Edibility', how appealing your spongy self looks. Seeming loosely based on the Five Second Rule, you can't spend too long touching the floor/rolling in ants or hair. This subsequently results in many restarts from mishaps in your yeastly yaw, which is also hilarious to watch. Who doesn't like watching a piece of bread fail at a highly unlikely adventure by spinning out of control across the room?\n\nThere's more than one way to slice a loaf. You can navigate through the room the way you decide, be it by skateboard, wall climbing, or by the 'easiest' path. With many different ways you can go, I am Bread is like an open world game. Just... open room. Swing from cabinets, smash the plates, hang off ledges: there's a whole bathroom of adventure out there!\n\nWith hope of more amazing content (and secrets), this game is worth every dime (and possibly penny). Definitely a must if on sale. It's truly a game, and not just a 'flop til you pop' gimmick.\n\nThis game is a crusted challenge. You will not succeed often. Persevere. One day you will be toast.","December 6, 2014","true","8.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You play as a piece of bread who goes on a massive adventure to become toasted like it always wanted, and sometimes picks up unwanted things like fishbones or bandaids that wear down your edibility. But the deeper meaning is clear. The bread is you, as you traverse through obsticles of life to become what you always wanted, but along the way you collect memories that change who you are, and once you hit 0% you know your dreams are over.

Bread is The Devil in edible form. Its inability to get toasted and my own determination to get the perfectly toasted morsel formed an ungodly combination  worthy of the book of revelations. I Would die and repeat as what little momentum I could generate was trampled under the ever darkening floor. As my many attempts of toasted glory ended up in trash I couldn't think clearly and the useall part of my brain that was used for sleeping eating and various other important tasks is filled with bread and anger towards the the most clingy hated force in the universe, Gravity.

Note: I'm not great at this game, I have failed countless times. This is all based on my experience as someone playing this for fun & taking my time towards the goal.\n\nI am Bread, from the makers of another favorite of mine Surgeon Simulator, leaves you in control of a slice of bread as you try to toast yourself by any means possible. I love the concept itself; it's silly, fun and frustrating beyond belief. It's more of a hit or miss if you'll like it. I'd suggest watching the game play and understanding that the controls are difficult and the game isn't completely serious before you buy it & suddenly find yourself upset because it's not perfect. It's Early Access & the developers are still adding a lot to this so I'm pretty content with what we have so far, though there's still a long way to go. *This means go to the Discussions and make suggestions, not whine over not besting the controls in 20 minutes* With that said...\n\nPros:\n- You are bread\n- You can roll in jam & butter to aid you in your goal\n- Be creative! There are other ways to heat bread other than a toaster, have fun with it.\n- A short narrative that follows our destructive path.\n- You can crawl in cereal or other things.\n- Make your heat source with destruction.\n- Smash things.\n- Take your time, have fun!\n- Playing/Watching this over live broadcast with a group of friends is very entertaining.\n- Procrastination simulator.\n\nCons:\n- The controls are hard. I don't see any way of this being improved, to be honest. It takes time to get used to them but once you are it's more of a challenge of not touching the floor.\n- The floor is lava.\n- This guy's house is disgusting. There are some walls you can't touch without dying if you don't respond fast enough. The carpet is not always so forgiving depending where you land.\n- The grip meter is necessary but it goes from fun to frustrating when you spend all that time climbing but you miss a beat & drop onto the nasty carpet again.\n- The timer. I beat a level in 5 minutes without soiling my bread & I made a D at best. Unless you're hardcore going for that heat source I wouldn't expect a great rating.\n- The camra angles.\n- ^ I stepped on hair & couldn't see it at first.\n- He's worried about bread wrecking his house yet he has garbage/germs littered everywhere. Why did you even leave the loaf out.\n- I have a hard time removing the top concealing the butter.\n- Please make the counters less "edgy" in some aspects. I realize desks & the like have an edge sticking out on top but at times it's nearly impossible for me to get over that tiny lump.\n\nPossible Bugs:\n- I can't seem to lift myself up vertically with 3 & 4 anymore the way I do with 1 & 2.\n- After flinging myself along the wall I can only grip again with maybe 1 or 2 keys or my bread won't grip at all.\n- On the bathroom level I always drop down & end up grasping the toothpaste. This causes it to spasm in all directions and nearly send me flying.\n\nPossible suggestions could go on forever so I'll just leave it at this. Enjoy bread simulator & if you're thinking about whining instead of a "this is why I don't like/recommend this game," turn off your computer & walk away. 10/10","December 9, 2014","true","9.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I enjoyed VVVVVV and Papers,Please. The problem with this game is that it's hard just for the sake of being hard. Even ignoring the less-than-ideal physics on account of it being early access. The game loses it's appeal quickly and has essentially no replay value. The controls are unessecarily complicated and there's not even any satisfaction in completing a level, because the next one is just as infuriating. It's like paying money for QWOP. If I could have gotten it for $1.99, the 15 minutes of entertainment struggling might have been worth it.

Moving around is beyond silly. What makes it worse is the lag in controls as well.  I'm running a i7 and this game still has delays within the control system.\nGraphics are mediocre at best. (And this is final version?)\nThere IS a goal of trying to toast yourself. Exciting.\nAnyway, if you hit the floor you die very quickly.\nMove on other objects and they smash.\nNot sure if I am meant to smash all the objects or what but that seems the high point of gameplay.\nIts general control has improved slightly since alpha, BUT there is still virtually no control of the main player.  The bread apparently has suction cups on the corners but they only last a little while. You end up just flopping around and spinning in circles. Movement is based more on luck that skill.\nGame itself seems aimed at either little children who may get a thrill out of flopping around like soggy bread, or those that may be easily amused (or those with child like mentallity.) There is no real purpose to the levels or real storyline.\nI gather its meant to be a bit of a joke type game but really the gameplay is the joke.\nThe developers seem to have had enough of the game, and released it as "Final" rather than fix up the bugs, poor graphics, poor gameplay and contolability issues.\nThey did add some silly levels that appear to have been done in a rush just for basic content fill, but none of those add anything to the game overall.\nContrary to all the silly coments and juvenile jokes, the only joke is developers charging for this.\nFor anyone looking for a game that is challenging, fun to play, and value for money - LOOK ELSEWHERE!\nThis game is not worth it, and although while it was in alpha I had slim hopes they would improve it, now that it supposedly finished, it is not worth the time of day.\nAVOID!\nIf you want to join the kiddy clubs and make silly jokes then spend your "bread" on this, and enjoy a half baked crusty game. Just another way to blow your dough!\nIsn't that fun - </sarcasm>","December 12, 2014","false","1.0"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","5","11","0","0"

Almost two years later i got it.\n\nWhen i got it, i expected the controlls to be "Bad" because i watched jacksepticeye play it but man i did not expect it to be this bad.\n\nthe controlls are... really hard to get the hang of. I  cant even climb up anythingXD\n\nit litterally spent  40-50  OR SO MINUTES I REPEAT 40-50 (even mabye 60) OR SO MINUTES GETTING INTO THE TOASTER ON THE KITCHEN LEVEL (The first level!) (I also had to find another way to toast my selfXD)\n\nI had to use the power up thing(Forgot the name sorry:/) to beat the first 2 levels on Story Mode.....But thats just me most likely....Moving on!\n\nThe bagel rece is pretty fun (Though if you play it with out getting the hang of the controlls like i did. level number  3 is gonna be hard (You have to climb up walls)\n\nBut then again this could be all me me just sucking at the controlls really bad.\n\nSo you could like it mabye for you it wil be worth 15 bucks or you can get the concept of the controlls better.\n\nBut i also played it for a little bit then stopped so i really have no place for making a reviewXD\n\nBut in my opinion i DON'T like this game. Mabye i will change My review, but i dont think i'll ever play that game againXD\n\n\nIf you stll want to get it after reading this then do it! :)\n\nBye!","May 30","false","3.0"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","43","3","7","2","1"

It’s quite simple; you are a piece of bread on a quest to become toasted. The controls definitely take some getting used to, as they are much different than many other games. After some time though, it becomes easier. But when you are falling to the floor because your grip ran out, it becomes a little hectic and difficult to get the right buttons. The music is catchy and tends to get stuck in your head. Though, in a good way. I would definitely recommend this.","December 8, 2014","true","6.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

There's no fun to be had here, there's not even any novelty that wears off quickly.  The controls are so hard to grasp that I didn't find myself having any fun and didn't have time to learn the controls before the novelty wore off.  Maybe if there was some sort of multiplayer this game might be worth the purchase, but I don't see it being worth anywhere near $10 at the moment.

A physics based game like surgeon simulator, but a platformer. Surely this was headed towards amazing comedic effect and fun gameplay, right? well you're an idiot if you still think that after more than an hour of playing this processed horse urine. Not only does it control like a drunk clown trying to do a balancing act while sucking on a cats nipples, but it feels like walking through a pool of molasses and rusty nails. You could ram your head on the sidewalk outside of your house for an hour and get the same effect that this game would give you. I'm sick of people saying this game is funny, or fun in general. It looks like something a college freshman cooked up on unity with 20 minutes of work and a $3 budget. It makes me ashamed that I decided to play this trash, and i'm even more ashamed that i played all the game modes trying to find something good. Except bagel, Bagel knows whats up. but you cant even enjoy him because he only has like 6 levels; then it's back to the same awkward controls that give me a brain tumor. Maybe if you sat down and really tried to master this games controls while also ignoring the graphics that look like something a dog would throw up, but doing so would be cruel and unusual torture.

I can't believe they raised the price to $13, not worth it at all. Go buy something else like Octodad, or a Five Nights At Freddy's game. Portal is friggin' sweet to, just don't buy this!!!! The only reason you should buy this is if you have an X-Box controller, and even then it would probably suck. The controls are terrible, and frame rate often slows down, camera is also terrible to. The only way this game would be fun is if it had a lovable character like... oh, I don't know... OCTODAD?! Don't listen to all the others... unless you have an X-Box controller, this game SUCKS!!!!","May 2, 2015","false","12.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

A physics based game like surgeon simulator, but a platformer. Surely this was headed towards amazing comedic effect and fun gameplay, right? well you're an idiot if you still think that after more than an hour of playing this processed horse urine. Not only does it control like a drunk clown trying to do a balancing act while sucking on a cats nipples, but it feels like walking through a pool of molasses and rusty nails. You could ram your head on the sidewalk outside of your house for an hour and get the same effect that this game would give you. I'm sick of people saying this game is funny, or fun in general. It looks like something a college freshman cooked up on unity with 20 minutes of work and a $3 budget. It makes me ashamed that I decided to play this trash, and i'm even more ashamed that i played all the game modes trying to find something good. Except bagel, Bagel knows whats up. but you cant even enjoy him because he only has like 6 levels; then it's back to the same awkward controls that give me a brain tumor. Maybe if you sat down and really tried to master this games controls while also ignoring the graphics that look like something a dog would throw up, but doing so would be cruel and unusual torture. This game makes me feel like hanging myself. the end","September 5, 2015","false","1.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","2"

In high settings the kayboard/mouse performed just as well if not better than when I played with a controller! So if you're having troubles experiment with different graphics settings. This issue may or may not get better as the game is worked on as it is currently in Early Access as I'm writing this review.***\n\nIf the above or below is helpful to you please thumb up so it can be helpful to others as well :-)\n\nHere's the "what you need to know": Control the 4 corners of a piece of bread to navigate across levels and find a way to make yourself into toast. It's much harder than it sounds as the bread is quite difficult to control. You can move and break most anything in a level so sometimes it's fun getting sidetracked and just break stuff. As you move your way up along objects and walls your "Grip" meter diminishes and when it's empty you fall prey to gravity, but it recharges after a second of not climbing. Also, avoid gross things in a level, namely the floor, ants, etc, as coming into contact will decrease your edibility, which is the games equicalent of a health bar. THAT'S IT! That's everything you need to know to jump in and have fun with I Am Bread.\n\nI've posted a brief and comical video of my playtime with the game on the I Am Bread community page, which can be seen here if you want to see my experience with the game firsthand: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxHRBbSpSdM","January 1, 2015","true","3.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

But they changed it to a big opened toaster which is easy to get in .\n\n2. When you started the early access version there was a menu which you could choose what resolution and graphic quality you want but now i just cant find anything to change my graphics. Since my Laptop isnt very strong i have to run the game at it's "Safe mode" which surprisingly still has good graphics but the Lights and the Textures of the floor and other things just flash and give you a Headache.\n\nNow lets go to the good things about the Full version :\n\n1. The HUD is a LOT better in the full version , with some Special effects and beeing Much Colorful.\n\n2. Full Story Mode !!!\n\n3. Inhanced Rampage mode. Rampage mode is The BEST part of the game in my idea. It was Great back then , And it is Still GREAT now. The improvement that they made is that They Re-Designed the maps Only for the Rampage mode. And There is a lot of BANG and BOOM sound right now because everything breaks in RAMPAGE MODE!!!!\n\n4. Something taht i like about the Full Version is that the Store page Has improved a lot !!! I like it This way !\n\n5. And finally Achievments and Trading cards which The Early access didnt have those.\n\nThats all i can say about the game.\nIts fun , Amazing , And pretty Challenging.\nI love the Game.\nIt is Definitely worth buying it.\n\n8.5 / 10\n\nGj Bossa , Again.","April 9, 2015","true","16.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You may or may not like this game. If you're like me, you brought the game because of the interesting title name and backstory.\n\nThat said backstory is that you literally play as bread. You are some guy's bread, and you need to move around his house haphazardly in order to 'toast' yourself. I thought this title would be worth a look, so I went ahead and brought it, and soon found out that this was a hard game.\n\nI'm not opposed to challenge. Some of the best games of all times were also the hardest. Challenge however shouldn't come in the form of bad camera angles and shoddy controls.\n\nThe idea behind I am bread is interesting, but once the novelty wears off, you'll probably find the game to be lackluster. Spending ages climbing up a fridge only to have you work undone by the punishing game mechanics isn't fun. It's tedious and boring. And once you get to the top of the fridge, you have to  proceed down a linear path in order to climb the next obstacle.\n\nUltimately, my point is this. You are apiece of bread which climbs things. There are literally only three or four game play elements that provide challenge. These game play elements are nothing new or exciting, and certainly not worth the price of this game.\n\nIf you can get it on sale, it might be worth a try. As it stands however, I Am Bread leaves a lot to be desired with me. This could have been an interesting game, but it is just so... boring, repetitive and tedious.","June 30, 2015","false","0.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The only gamemodes i like is the free roam (though it gets very boring after a while) and the rampage gamemode. The game also give no indication of what you can use to heat yourself up. The garden level is the worst one of  them ALL. I dont recommend this game to anyone. Its a lazily sloped together game that shouldnt get this much popularity. Its just youtuber bait.

The game is very fun and I do like Bossa Studios games because they do not give you the easiest controls they want to challenge you in a way you will rage. But boy does it feel good beating one of the levels, I have played up to level 3 in the story so far but there are other things to do like Rampage where you destroy everything. There is Ram-Page where you are the goat simulator goat destroying everything. There is Zero Gravity, that is where you just float around and try to get toasted. There is Starch Wars, where you are the piece of Bread like a tie-fighter, I haven't played starch wars too much so I do not no they objective. There is also bagel race where you are a bagel rolling around the house trying to get all the checkpoints and get to the finish line in the shortest amount of time. This game is extremley fun I would give it a 9/10. I ussualy give 10/10, but at first it is so hard that I had to take away 1 so. I just love this game, and so I also got surgeo simulator, MUCH HARDER, but still fun. I just love the way this game was developed and if you are really bad after failing for like 5 tries there is like a golden thing and if you get that you are invincible. So you dont lose edibility when you fall on the floor. Oh yeah I forget to say this game is about you, a piece of bread, trying to get toasted. Also if you have Octodad and like it, this is the game for you but with a different objective from octodad. Just I cant exspress how much I like this game I know I havent played it for like 100 hours like some people but I still just like this game very much even if I have only played it for 8.5 hours on record, but bossa studios keep up the good work on your games they are very, very enjoyable and raging, but the rage makes it fun.","June 6","true","9.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

It's definitely a nice curiosity, and it has some entertainment value - But it can also be very frustrating due to the unpredictable nature of the physics.\n\nObviously, getting used to it you'll get better at manoeuvering yourself around the environments, you'll still have difficulty executing an exact plan and making any fine adjustments. It's hard to imagine how they might improve the control system for mouse and keyboard, but one remains hopeful.\n\nThe concept remains quite funny, and the bolt-on story serves to amuse as you progress, as well as give reason to the increasingly elaborate household gauntlets of various unpleasant substances strewn across your path.\n\nIn short, as the novelty goes I think I would recommend the game - However from a purely critical perspective of enjoying the game itself and the content that exists as of yet, I would say go for it if you're interested, but only cautiously.","December 3, 2014","false","4.7"," 22 of 46 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","22","46","0","0"

The game seemingly punishes you for nothing (it's dirty surfaces, but just getting even remotely close to them kills you), physics are completely haywire (again, more random punishment, you've done good, and the game just slaps you back in the face) and it just isn't funny when there is mostly a sense of pointless punishment, rather than a good feeling of achievement. Got to the bathroom level and then I just ended up saying "no".\n\nI guess some of the jokes are funny enough, and the story seems interesting, but I was expecting Surgeon Simulator kind of fun.

But one single issuse I have with this game is IT IS SO FRUSTRATING that I couldn't get past the 1ST LEVEL. The controls are so ♥♥♥ that I thought that the control was made by a 2 year old. Here are the controls: 1,2,3,4 and Q and E and the mouse. The 1st level puts you in an unfair situation as you need to toast yourself. Simple! But the toaster is ACROSS THE ENTIRE ROOM. plus you have to make it back to the plate with the "ediblility" meter still remaning. It may sound simple but you CANNOT touch the ground more than 1 MINUTE. If you stay on the ground, YOU WILL DIE! That's not only the ground! Here is a list of enemies that you CAN'T fight:\n\n-Ants\n\n-Sharp Objects\n\n-etc.\n\nThings you CAN fight:\n\n-Nothing\n\nSome people have trouble using their Gamepad. I'm one of them.

There’s a simulator for everything you ever wanted to be, as well as games for a couple things you had no idea you wanted to be. I Am Bread has become the supreme frontrunner of the latter category in my book. The story is hysterical, told via psychiatrist statements about a man with rooms in his house being destroyed, and swearing that bread can move. The music is spot on, and the controls can take a lot of getting used to, but are completely fair. Made by Bossa Studios, it’s not a far throw from Surgeon Simulator, except that it features a wonderfully huge open world to explore, rather than just some dude’s chest cavity. You’ve been a goat, a deer, a gorilla, a farmer, a prisoner, a spaceman, and a rock. Now it’s finally time to pinch your inner loaf… Or something like that. Lets take a closer look at I Am Bread.\n\nThe first thing you’ll probably notice when you get into the game is the strange controls. Q,W,E,R (Or LT/LB RT/LB) are each assigned to a corner of your slice, pressing that button will cause the bread to grab, then you can fling yourself around using your mouse or control stick.  It sounds so simple, but much pain went into perfecting its execution… I’d say it was almost an hour before I became the ninja-bread man I never knew I longed to be. Once you finally stop nudging your bread along like Granny Gumgums, the music starts to click. It’s jazzy and quick and it makes my wall-crawling bread feel like he’s truly on the most dramatic adventure of his life. Hell, it probably is. It’s just a slice of bread after all.\n\nOnce you’ve mastered your abilities, you must complete the mission of getting toasted. Some lowly peons will tell you to use a toaster. Poppycock! I say find the nearest blow-dryer and just do what comes most natural. You also must stay off the floor, and away from gross stuff like trash and dishwater, as it will deplete your edibility bar. Once bread is no longer edible, it’s dead. Dead bread. The world is amazingly interactive. Almost everything can be broken or flung across the room via wonky physics, with delightful results! There is only one puzzle, “How can I become toast?”, but the answers are multiple, and as creative as you care to make them.\n\nNow the ugly. The game does crash quite a bit… Which made recording at any length a bit frustrating. The controls are strange, but it’s likely on purpose, to increase the wackiness. That doesn’t do much for the extreme difficulty spike between the first level and the second, but there is time to adjust that as well. I also have to point out that the hardest part is wiggling yourself into the toaster. It caused me SO much heartache… You finally get to the toaster, only to discover that the real struggle has just begun. Overall though, I had a lot of fun with this game, and will likely return to it in the future. The environments are varied, and the freedom to solve a puzzle by riding on a rocket or skateboard, or simply scooting along the rug in a pot amuses me to no end.\n\nSummary: A zany bread-simulator game with an open world and loads of freedom.\n\nFinal Score: 7/10 for gameplay, physics, and replayability. 9/10 with smaller difficulty curve.","December 17, 2014","true","3.4"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

I'm usually pretty good at these kinds of games, but this one just really frustrates me.

If you like feeling a seemingly simple game obliterate your gamer's pride, this one is definitely for you.

In 3d. With bread. I can't be arsed to finish the ♥♥♥♥ing thing so I have no idea whether the theme of bread will make sense at the end or if it's just for the lulz so random factor.\n\nFact is it could be a lot of fun. It certainly looks fun anyway. When it works, it is fun. But the camera is atrocious, and since your bread rotate based on where the camera stands all it takes is making a few steps of progress for whatever angle you had on your bread to change and thus having to do a frustrating balancing act with both joystiq when all it would take to make the game actually playable would be to have the camera fixed. The camera doesn't move unless you move it.\n\nThat's all it would take to make the game three times more enjoyable. It's that one tiny little thing that makes the game pretty much unbearable. Perhaps that's the point, it's cleverly designed to be just at the frontier between fun and complete garbage.\n\nWhatever the case, wait for a sale. Don't pay full price.
