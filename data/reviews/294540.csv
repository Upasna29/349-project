I started playing these at about five and now at eighteen me and my twenty five year old sister went back and bought all of the Freddi Fish games. If you're like me and grew up with them then you alrady know that these are the best kids games around to date. They taught problem solving skills and good morals without ever making it seem like work. All the games share a common lay out and a cast of memorable characters that children can really get into. I not only highly recomend these but also highly recomend the entire Humongous Entertainment collection. It's nostalgia at its best for us "older kids" and it's good clean fun for young children that will keep them comming back for hours on end.\n\nP.S. all the Humongous Enternainment package games sport at least two different versions of their stories, one common one and one rare one. It just makes them even more fun...that and the fact that you can quite literally click on anything for a funny result.","June 6, 2014","true","1.2"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","17","17","0","0"

These titles focus on a range of light academics including basic geography, basic to upper elementary level mathematics, logical thinking, critical thinking and puzzle solving, topped off with reinforcement of good manners and polite social etiquette. At the lower end of the age spectrum, they may require some adult supervision and supportive guidance, but there is no better series of games for a child’s first venture into PC gaming.\n\nI remember almost nothing about Freddi Fish 3; upon replaying it, some snippets here and there came back to me, but there were also locations that I swear I never saw. From my experience over a decade later, I think The Case of the Stolen Conch Shell is a great entry in the Freddi Fish franchise, but your child's engagement may vary depending on their personal interests. To it’s credit, the solving of a mystery is a great way to develop logical thinking, deductive reasoning and to a strangely competent extent, the ability to read emotional and behavioral clues. Buy the Case of the Missing Kelp Seeds first and if that goes well, consider picking up Freddi Fish 3.","December 2, 2014","true","0.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

There's certainly a nostalgic value here, however, it's not by any means as good as you remember it. The writing is very plain and dialogue is delivered very slowly and overly well-annunciated; the polar opposite of Pajama Sam's witty pop culture references and smoothly-delivered dialogue. The puzzles in these kinds of games have never been challenging, but in FF3 they're very limited. It can only be assumed that this game was intended for a much younger audience.\n\nTo sum it up, don't buy this unless you played it as a kid, and even then don't expect the sugar-coated memories to make this any better.

Someone stole the conch shell AND the crowd blamed an innocent person for it enough to where they send that innocent person to jail\n- The backgrounds are nice to look at\n- Freddi and Luther still have excellent banter, and the characters have interesting things to say\n--> Except Horse Fetters. It's awesome to blame him every game while he counters with suspicious sounding gibberish :)\n\nCONS\n- It's easy/fast to go through all the branching paths\n- The temple sequence, which is always the same except for getting a different colored crystal...Always tedious to go through that\n- The minigame where you match four sea animals together for an extended amount of time; not only does it take forever, it's incredibly easy and I usually exit out of playthroughs where I have to do that minigame\n- Freddi still comes off as condescending to Luther, but not as much as other games I've played...This could be a pro depending on your personality but sometimes Freddi is a little too self-righteous for my tastes. She'll look at me when Luther does something wrong, as if I should chastise him too. Well, sometimes, we all just want to reach for shiny jewels, Freddi. Accept human/aquariam nature\n- Horse Fetters isn't always the culprit :(\n- The price is way too high\n\nThis is my favorite of the Freddi Fish games. I love that there are so many culprits and they all have different motivations for stealing the conch shell. It's definitely too expensive for what it offers, but I got these on sale for about $2-3, so I suggest waiting for them to go on sale again. I feel like the different playthroughs are interesting in how you get different golden pipes for the conch shell, so if you're the kind of person who likes playing well-thought-out children's games, I definitely recommend this as I feel like the game doesn't automatically assume you're a child, especially given the ending sequences for each of the culprits.\n\nIf you ever feel like you want to solve a mystery that doesn't require too much thought, play this. It's a different culprit every time and as far as children's games go, it still reigns supreme in my book. Freddi Fish and Luther still got nothing on the Pajama Sam universe, though.","January 20, 2015","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Let me tell you about Freddi Fish 3.\n\nIt's not a bad game for kids. It really is not, but there are still defining flaws, some of them are issues with the entire franchise I've found.\n\nOn the positive side we have that this game allows for a lot of exploration, but not too much, just enough that a child can wrap his/her mind around the environment, which you have to do to gather up the dirt on the suspects so that you'll know who stole the golden pipes at the end. It's a fun little meander through a bouncy, colorful aquatic environement, and while I feel the pixelly graphics look and feel very dated; I didn't mind it one bit playing this game as a kid.\n\nOn the negative side we have... well the gameplay. At times doing the stupid chores that this game throws out gets horribly dull, especially when you figure out it leads to nothing but a minigame or nothing but an extra feature. (I'm looking at you, Carnival.) Although I might be thinking too adult here, as I do know Children can be very easily distracted but still very entertained by extra features and minigames, but I myself, even as a child got a little peeved when I found out doing work was for naught.\n\nAll in all, it's a neat little game, a little short, a little dull and a little dated, but it's not bad. It has extra features like the minigame, the organ that makes cow sounds and watching Luther go through "The Terrific Tumble Tubes" that make the game feel a bit more lively. It's still not a perfect kid's game, but it's okay, I enjoyed it as a kid, I just don't think I'd play it again.","January 2, 2015","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was the first REAL game I ever played and I have such vivid memories about this game. My father says he remembers me so excited to play this game, and how early I would wake up just to play Freddi Fish and how happy this game made me. The memories I think, is what impacts me the most. These memories give me flashbacks which invigorate me, which in turn brings aspiration, which then fills me with DETERMINATION. This game sparked my imagination as a young child and I have never had so much love for a game ever, period. And if you just happen to be scrolling by and you read this review and you think in your head "Oh this game? This game is for babies." Well you are just simply wrong, and I am raw proof of this game being rated “E for Everyone”\n\nI have just revisited this game 12 years later (I am currently 14) and there is nothing, and I mean nothing more comforting in this world than such an underwater coral reef with comforting voice actors to soothe you as a toddler, it makes you feel as if you are in another dimension and it is so soothing it’s just ohhhhhhh. To be honest when I played this game as a baby I actually thought I was fast asleep, dreaming because of how comforting it was. That might be a big reason why you see most babies these days glued to smartphones, who's to say they feel any differently? I bet I can prove that they feel overwhelming comfort because they are stimulating their young brains. Anyway, all these colors, voices, quests, with little things you can click on, and the comfort that is provided alongside all these is why you find "Freddi Fish 3: The Case of the Stolen Conch Shell" playable by all ages. I might be alone with all these feelings connected to this game…but I have these feelings of nostalgia towards this game and I’m sure you have a game that you feel the same way about as well and if that doesn’t convince you enough to play this game, then you aren’t human.","February 12","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
