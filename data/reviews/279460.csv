I am going to bank on my terrible knowledge of handball as to why this game isnt very good. It feels a little dated but I am no snob. I purchased on sale for fairly cheap. Everything feels like this was a game made by accident.","March 30, 2014","false","0.2"," 52 of 82 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","52","82","0","3"

I am an avid sports gamer, and I love the old along with new. Yes the graphics are dated, but the gameplay is not. I really enojoy playing this game as it is unique and I only saw a bit of this sport while stationed in Germany. If you are like me and an overall avid sports gamer, this game is worth getting for your library. This game is not for the faint of heart, it is challenging.\n\nPLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT COMPARE THIS GAME TO THE LIKES OF FIFA, MADDEN, THE SHOW, OR 2K SPORTS.\nIHF IS IN A LEAGUE OF ITS OWN, WHAT I TERM AS NOVELTY SPORTS GAMES.","March 23, 2015","true","0.7"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","18","22","0","0"

I didn't expected much... but I was still disappointed. KI is basically not existing, neither on the own team (standing in perfect offensive Formation is nice....but not when your own goalkeeper has the ball and is looking for a player to throw it to), nor on the other.\nAnd what bugs me the most is, that the most significant errors should be fixed pretty easy, e.g. the given example.\nI was only able to stand it for some minutes, I don't think I even played it for an hour... it was just...sad","July 20, 2014","false","0.9"," 13 of 24 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","13","24","0","0"

It was over advertised, took a long time to develop.. but the final result is probably the worst game I ever bought and played. Totally disapponted by this game. And I'm sure many handballers and fans will be as disappointed. It was probably better to make an "Handball Manager"-ish game, instead, giving the result. Difficult to play, embarassing animations (we're almost in 2015)... I expected something better, since the game has been advertised four / five years ago!!","December 10, 2014","false","1.2"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"
