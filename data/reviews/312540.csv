The first game was Ys I: Ancient Ys Vanished in 1987, and since then numerous titles have been released, and some remade a few times for other consoles and handhelds. They are still being developed to this day, with a new title having been recently announced for the Playstation 4 and Vita.\n\nThe Ys series chronicles the adventures of Adol Christin, a young man with a zest for adventure and an uncanny knack for being in the right place at the right time. Currently we only have 4 Ys titles on Steam, with Ark of Napishtim being the 6th installment. First released for PC back in 2003, it was later ported to the Playstation 2 in 2005, and the PSP in 2006. Ark of Napishtim was the first English release of the series since Ys III: Wanderers of Ys. An English translation of the original PC version was released here on Steam on April 28th of 2015m with some enhancements and added features. The Steam release is hands-down the definitive version of Ark of Napishtim.\n\nGameplay\n==========\nArk of Napishtim is a hack and slash action RPG with some light platforming elements. Controlling Adol Christin, players are able to freely move around the world, jump, and attack enemies. The game takes place on the Canaan Islands, after an attack on Adol's ship forced him to sail into an unknown region and into a large storm. This resulted in Adol being thrown off his ship and washing ashore in a new mysterious land.\n\nProgression is story and exploration driven. As you explore each new area, bits of story are revealed through dialogue and events. You will also find treasure hidden all over, some of them granting new abilities or allowing you to explore areas you were previously unable to. Pieces of equipment, as well as healing items and accessories, are also hidden in treasure chests. To save your game you need to find a Spirit Monument. Touching one will completely heal you and cure any status ailments. Typically great areas to grind EXP and gold are the areas near Spirit Monuments.\n\nAdol will eventually have access to three different swords with magical properties, each based on a particular element: Fire, Wind, or Thunder. These can be upgraded over the course of the game using Emelas Ore, which is dropped by enemies in small amounts. Upgrading your swords unlocks new traits for them, such as increasing their attack power, unlocking special elemental magic, or increasing magic regeneration. Upgrading your swords is the best way to strengthen Adol against the challenges he faces, so make it a point to collect as much Emelas Ore as you can.\n\nOne of the best things about Ys titles are the boss battles. Every boss is a screen-filling affair, requiring careful movement and precise strikes to bring down. The boss battles are easily the most exciting parts of the game.\n\nOne of the new features added to the Steam release of this title is Catastrophe Mode, which means you will not be able to stock up and use healing items freely. The game will play more like Ys Origin or Oath in Felghana, with healing items being used automatically when you pick them up! Couple this with Nightmare difficulty and you have one hell of a challenge ahead of you.\n\nThe other new feature is the inclusion of a special item called the Wing of Alma. This enables you to warp between all found Spirit Monuments. This saves you SO much time it's unreal. In older releases you would literally had to backtrack through many areas, using the Wing of Alma you simply select the Spirit Monument and you're off!\n\nGraphics\n==========\nArk of Napishtim got a slight upgrade in it's looks department. Utilizing DirectX8, the game looks much better than it's previously releases. Smooth animations all around, from Adol, enemies, and even bosses. Every sprite is very sharp, well designed, and highly detailed. Perhaps the best thing about the game are the environments. The land, water, the skies, dark caves, and ancient ruins all look fantastic.\n\nSound and Music\n==========\nYs is known for its musical scores, and Ark of Napishtim is no exception. Every track is amazing. From the boss theme to each different area's own theme, the music is really second to none. I wish there were soundtrack editions here on Steam for us to buy, as I would buy every single one. Physical collector's edition Ys releases usually come with a soundtrack disc, so I don't see a reason why Steam users can't have a similar option available.\n\nAs for sound effects, you have your usual Ys sounds. Attacks, footsteps, monsters...all have viable sound effects. They sound great, especially swinging the different swords and using the elemental magic.\n\nPerformance\n==========\nPerfect 60 FPS all across the board. No lag, stuttering, slowdown, framerate drops, or random crashes. The game literally ran without a single hitch. Flawless.\n\nArk of Napishtim has full controller support, and is the recommended way to play the game. My only gripe is with one of the 'hidden' abilities: Dash Jump. To do it, you have to move in a direction and press the jump and attack buttons at the exact same time. I am able to do it properly maybe 40% of the time, and never when I need to. There is a guide available that uses a script to make it a lot easier, but I have yet to try it as I prefer to try and master the technique myself.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n==========\nA fantastic re-release of a fantastic game, Ark of Napishtim is a fun and exciting action RPG that fans of the genre will love. If you have not played a Ys title before, you owe it to yourself to buy Ark and all the other titles on Steam. If nothing else it'll show Nihon Falcom and XSEED Games that we want more Ys on available here on Steam!\n\nGameplay Demo\n==========\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSNo-LVqbwE\n\nNerd House Verdict:\n==========\nHighly Recommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","August 21, 2015","true","34.6"," 69 of 74 people (93%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","93","69","74","5","4"

You join Adol on another exciting adventure as he washes ashore the Canaan Islands within a fictional equivalent of the Bermuda Triangle after his survives yet another shipwreck, as expected of Ys openings.\nYs VI the Ark of Napishtim is the first Ys game of this engine; Oath in Felghana and Origin are the sequels that came after it, despite Felghana taking place chronologically before VI and Origin taking place hundreds of years before Ys I&II. Because this is the first game of this engine, you might feel that the gameplay is less refined than its two sequels of the same battle system. Even if Ys VI is the first game of this engine, the combat is still satisfying with its three elemental swords having different attack style and may even require finesse to master. Wind sword Livart requires successful button press in certain frames to spin Adol right round like a record baby like Felghana and Origin's Wind magic (just referring to Yunica and Adol's Wind magic). Fire sword Blirante allows you to charge your swipes for powerful flame waves. Lightning sword Erricil has you mashing buttons for a thrusting attack that lets you penetrate even the sturdier foes like a certain frog boss you'll fight later. Fans of previous Ys games and fans of action games in general will love this game.\nCan't have a Falcom game without awesome soundtrack, and Ark of Napishtim delivers. Enjoy listening to the smooth Ultramarine Deep as you fight a certain disgruntled, butthurt, and jelly black-haired rival in Mythos Path, Mountain Zone as you trigger your PTSD flashback as you dash past exploding balls in Grana-Vallis Mountains, and Ruined City Kishgal as you explore a technologically advanced underground ruin.\nFor those who have never played a Ys game, this is a great start as you will appreciate the gameplay refinements in the sequel Ys the Oath in Felghana and Ys Origin. For veterans of the series you will love the game because it's more classic Falcom goodness before they joined the anime cliché-brigade with Sen no Kiseki. For those who play it already, buy this game anyways to convince Xseed we want more Falcom games localized for the West. Give this game a shot. You won't regret it.","April 28, 2015","true","8.2"," 79 of 91 people (87%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","87","79","91","22","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sylphrit/recommended/312540/","sylphrit","Sylphrit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sylphrit/","304 products in account","First of all, thank you Falcom for developing this franchise. Thank you Xseed for releasing it post konami licensing!\n\nOne of the few great gems on the PSP originally ported from various other systems that still kept its charm as one of my most favorite action adventure, dungeon crawling, hack and slash games of all time! For those coming from the PSP/Vita era who missed out on this or Oath in Felghana, it retains a jump system that further expands combat past the simple slash-slash-dodge-special attack-swap party members-repeat system, given you take control of solely Adol himself.\n\nThis game's deep exploration makes it one for many secrets and vague linearity to plot progress. Yes, I still get lost sometimes taking that left fork instead. Each area contains various monsters of certain levels which are a challenge if not impossible for Adol in his level infancy. This is what shapes the game's level system. The combat is a fun grind for money and EXP to move up the ladder.\n\nCombat is developed with a 3D aspect in mind. Given, Adol wields a sword and shield, where damage is avoided if certain enemies attack on the shield side. Not only is there a good amount of items and equipment to procure throughout the journey, there are also combat mechanisms that more modern remakes of Ys games lack. The jump system. This deepens the exploration of the game with more platforming than guessing which tunnel is the wrong path and backtracking. It also welcomes a jump attack and dropping attack mechanism that helps in combat with a variety of damage dealing maneuvers. Combat aside, this game revolves Adol's journey of collecting magical swords, each with it's own element and moveset. This is the core combat mechanism of The Ark of Napishtim.\n\nFollowing Adol's journey in searching for these swords, he meets very memorable characters. Some of which people in the latter games on the PSP and Vita are simply left to accept that they exist. Have you ever wondered who Geis is and how he met Adol? He was never always allied with Adol. This is the game to play. (Another shout out to origin stories is for The Oath in Felghana, where it describes Adol's meeting of Dogi from Dogi's friends' perspectives as well as his iconic blue scarf).\n\nOther than a solid story of our amnesiac red head adventurer and his combat prowess this game features a memorable soundtrack and nostalgic pseudo-modern pixel art and beautiful portraits of characters to keep the game attractive.\n\nXseed has finally ported this to PC with much appreciated features like teleporting between Save Points (obviously to prevent people like me to still get lost in this vast world! LOL)\n\nFinal note to new player of this game, save before the last area on another slot! Once you've entered the Ark, theres literally no turning back and once the game ends they dont take you back, so you'd be stuck in that final area in that save state. Xseed probably fixed this with the save point warping, but just a heads up just in case you still want to mess around in the overworld. :)\n\nMost of all ENJOY THE GAME!\n\nRecommended others within the genre: Ys franchise (Felghana, Origins, I and II are on steam!), Gurumin a monstrous adventure is another great game by Falcom, and Legend of Heroes franchise for the JRPG enthusiasts (currently one one is ported to Steam that I've seen).\n\n-TNHu: Sylphrit D.","April 28, 2015","true","1.8"," 35 of 40 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","35","40","2","0"

Two kind strangers approach by the names of Isha and Olha who come to your aid and then make further introductions to rest of the Rehda family.

Including options for Anti Aliasing, 4k+ resolutions and 120hz+ panels. Gamepad would be suggested but all keys were completely remappable. Only thing missing would be voiced characters but it's certainly not a reason to ignore another wonderful entry into the series.\n\nSomething to mention was the surprise inclusion of 3gb worth of free material art that is otherwise only obtainable via boxed collectors editions. Characters through to concept work including psd files! Catastrophe Mode was also added which can increase the difficulty of the game quite dramatically for those that thrive on a challenge. Basically it removes the ability to equip healing items and they cannot be purchased only found as loot.\n\nWith the infamous hard rock soundtrack, crazy boss fights, meaningful story and some old fashioned getting your butt whooped by explorations of areas that are beyond your level. Hard to go past recommending adding The Ark of Napishtim to your collections jrpg fans.

Moreover, it was the precursor to the widely popular engine of Ys: The Oath in Felghana and Ys Origin.\n\nAs such, it is no slouch in the gameplay department (It is not as polished as its sequels, but impressive in its own right)  and has one of the best soundtracks of the series. The bosses are fun and challenging, which is to be expected from this series, also the difficulty curve is fairly good. As it is at least a decade old game, the graphics aren't impressive, but that is not its selling point! For seasoned veterans of the franchise, the game is littered with lore, trivia and references that many would identify which helps to flesh the background of the Ys world.\n\nI highly recommend it to anyone new and old to the series, especially any fan of the action RPG genre. It's an Ysy purchase!\n\nFinally, thank you XSEED for updating this game with additional features and for making it available to us!","April 28, 2015","true","24.7"," 30 of 36 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","30","36","2","0"

I don't know why I haven't give the series a shot ages ago. I'll try to keep my review short and spoiler-free as possible. Note that this is my first entry to the series so I can't say or compared it to the previous Ys games in terms of gameplay and mechanics.\n\nYs VI is an action RPG more like a Zelda-esque game rather than the classic turn-based JRPG. This also means that the gameplay feels faster and much simpler than the classic RPG. This can be either pro or cons depending on your preferences.\n\nPros\nInteresting characters and engaging storyline\nFun, fluid and satisfying combat mechanics, albeit a bit too simple.\nOn-the-fly equipment swap so that you can keep the flow going (which is fortunate since you're gonna have to fight a lot)\nSatisfying boss battles, not to mention some of them are huge!\nComplete customization, catered to the PC community. Tons of graphical options are available via the launcher before the start of the game. On maxed out settings, the game looks gorgeous while still keeping the PS2 look intact (although the cutscene videos are horrible. Too much of a hassle to remake it in full HD, eh?)\nHigh replayability. Multiple modes (Normal, Hard, Nightmare), option to play in Catastrophe (hardcore) mode and Time Attack mode (unlocked after beating the game once), where you're clocked in beating each of the bosses available in game.\nOptional Mega-Boss for the most hardcore players. Seriously, not for the faint-hearted and casual gamers (like me T_T)\nFull controller support (highly recommended, I used the standard Xbox 360 controller), customization are available in the launcher alongside the graphical option.\nThe story are tied in with the previous Ys series but it doesn't affect gameplay as much.\n\nNeutral\nThis can be either a positive or negative based on each individual's preferences.\n\nThe game is surprisingly short (for a JRPG). You can basically finished the whole game in less than 8, maybe 6 hours even if not for the unnecessary grindfest.\nNo stats management whatsoever. Aside from the usual stats upgrade from levelling up, the only way to increase your stats are by accessories and armors found throughout the game.\nLack of items variety. Stores are pretty much useless after midgame and the selection of equipments are very limited.\nCons\nThis game is design as a GRINDFEST! If you're planning to play the game, be ready to grind, a lot. Some are just unnecessary too since most of the time your progression is blocked just because your level is not high enough or your swords are not leveled approriately. To make it worse, the game makes you deal 0 damage to the enemies that are stronger than you and you're forced to grind for a while before moving on with the story. On the plus side though, the combat is smooth and not much of a pain if you compared it to the traditional JRPG (I'm looking at you, Final Fantasy)\nFRUSTRATING and definitely UNNECESSARY Dash Jump mechanic. Basically it's a move where your character can jump a little bit further than the usual jump can get you. However to execute this, you need to press the jump button, followed immediately with an attack. It sounds easy here but trust me, it's EFFING HARD since you'll either successfully Dash Jump or failed and do a short Lunge Attack instead. It's impractical in actual combat and are just needed in certain dungeons to reach a chest. The controller-throwing moments comes when you tried to do a Dash Jump, but failed and you fall downwards and are forced to backtrack a long walk to reach that point again (and of course, failing again).\nAccessories and event items are MISSABLE if you're careless. I missed out on a few good accessories myself due to the story progression. If you're planning to get all of them, check out a guide beforehand.\nThe map is really small and you'll see most of it in no time. The game also requires you to backtrack a lot for items and story progression. Fortunately, there's an accessory that let's you teleport to any save point in the game (super neat) although you do have to find it first.\nI experience minor stuttering at certain points of the game but nothing really game breaking. Just thought I'd mention it.\nHORRIBLE cutscene videos! C'mon, it's 2016 already. You can at least do it in 720p.\nAnti-climatic final boss.\nOverall, this is a really nice and enjoyable action RPG, suitable for casuals and hardcore gamers alike. I myself have not been playing JRPGs in a long while and Ys VI definitely is a good welcome back to the genre. Aside from the minor quirks and questionable game designs, I can safely recommend this to newcomers and veterans of the genre.\n\nPersonally, I gave Ys VI: The Ark of Napishtim a solid 4/5. Highly recommended!\n\nP.S. I'm writing this at 3 a.m. in the morning so please kindly notify me if I made a mistake in grammar or spelling in my review. I'll also add some more to the review in case more points come to mind.","January 29","true","14.9"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","22","24","0","10"

It doesn't have the Alma Trials from the PS2 release but the warpable save points go much further in making the game more enjoyable to play.\n\nThat said, Ys VI certainly shows its age as the first 3D Ys game, as Oath and Origins improve on basically everything that Ys VI tried to do; not that Ys VI is a bad game, but it has some clear flaws.  One of those was a lot of unnecessary backtracking that is made moot in this version with the introduction of an item that you get about two hours into the game that lets you warp to all previously visited save points.  This removes a lot of unnecessary frustration and backtracking.\n\nSome other problems include really weird level/enemy scaling.  Ys games have always been level dependent, but Ys VI takes into another level, as most areas will have enemies that can easily wreck you at first, but after a couple of levels, you'll be wrecking them.  It's a super-fast turnaround with little subtlety. In my playthough of this, I reached the second boss on like level 14 or something with a level two sword and literally couldn't damage it.  The game's action is fast-paced and fluid, and you level up quickly if you're considered underleveled, but you ♥♥♥♥ed up the level scaling somewhere when this kind of thing can happen. Bosses are rather uninspired compared to the other Ark trilogy games, and Limewater Cave is probably the worst dungeon in a Ys game.  Dash-jumping also is a pain that was abandoned after this game.\n\nOnto the positives, even though the gameplay is a bit behind Oath and Origins, it's still fast-paced and has a good feel.  Most of the gameplay is just jumping around and hitting ♥♥♥♥ with your sword and is relatively simple but it's satisfying beyond the sum of its parts.  Adol moves fast, swings his sword fast and it just feels right.\n\nIt's a Falcom Sound Team jdk soundtrack so you know it rules, though it's one of the more unmemorable ones.  The story and characters are generic, typical Ys fare.\n\nThis review comes off as sort of negative, but I mainly want to highlight Ys VI being the predecessor to Oath and Origins and that you should adjust your expectations accordingly.  If you have only played the Ys games on Steam, go into this knowing that it's the foundation the next two games improved on in every way.\n\nIn short, a fast-paced, flawed action game that XSeed did a great job handling and worth a look if you have any interest in action games or other Ys titles.","May 13, 2015","true","10.4"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","21","24","0","1"

While the story is mostly standalone, a few characters from previous titles return, some playing major roles. If you a stickler for being in the know, it would be best to play the earlier titles first.\n\nFor returning fans from Origin and Oath of Felghana, there's a few differences you'll probably notice immediately. Adol is slower, no mobile techs beyond a lunge jump(which the game expects you to learn, and has precise platforming involving it), and magic is now tied to one of 3 weapons all separately upgradable. Most enemies, however, are also slower so you're not at a disadvantage. The game has two modes, one where you can buy and slot healing items to use, and a new mode that disables it altogether. Remember how in Oath or Origin, monsters would sometimes drop herbs you would immediately use? The new mode, catastrophe mode, works just like that.\n\nTo those of you who are challenge crazy, 6's Nightmare is probably the easiest currently available of Ys on steam. It certainly isn't EASY, but you won't make as much sweat as Oath of Felghana Produced. Platforming, however, is definitely the hardest. As mentioned before, some jumps you have to make are extremely precise. Game isn't the best at these sections, so you might have a headache trying to get certain items. Will, honestly.\n\nGreat Music. Same great gameplay. Runs like a dream. No bugs to report as of yet, and currently sitting on 18 hours of play. Delightfully straight forward story, that plays out exactly like you expect yet manages to engross you due to excellent world building. Keyboard and Mouse controls work great. So does controller support. Probably the definite version of 6 as it stands. For those wondering, this version of Ark of Napishtim does not include the PS2 version's content. So no hilariously bad "I'm Dogi the wall crusher! Want your walls crushed?" for you. The line is still in, actually, but not voiced.\n\nAll in all great game, highly recommend. Hope you can find it in your heart to let Ys 6 into your life.","April 29, 2015","true","20.8"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PSOCecil/recommended/312540/","PSOCecil","PSOCecil","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PSOCecil/","1089 products in account","Another excellent Ys game from Falcom, with another great translation from XSeed. Ys VI grabbed the Zelda-esque gameplay from the Japan-exclusive Ys V, and made it 3D, and improved it in many ways.\n\nVisually, Ys VI uses a strange Donkey Kong Country-esque rendering style for the character sprites, which hasn't aged that well, in all honesty. Unlike the PS2 version, which used polygons for the characters, the PC version of Ys VI doesn't, nor does it reflect equipment changes on Adol's model, which is unfortunate, but easily ignored.\n\nThe music is the usual high quality, catchy, upbeat tracks that Falcom is known for, with a fair amount of stand out tracks. Sound effects are what you'd expect, sword swipes, monster growls. The PS2 version's voice acting is not in this version, for better or for worse.\n\nAs stated earlier, Ys VI uses the Zelda-like action style from Ys V, unlike Ys I, II, and IV. Much like 'regular' action games, you have buttons for attacking, with a combo depending on which of three swords you have equipped, a jump button, your 'magic' button, and an item use button. The item use button stands out here, as the ability to stockpile and use items wasn't in the other two Ys games of this style, Oath in Felghana or Origins. This, with the right amount of health items, makes Ys VI rather easy, if you choose to use the items. But you don't have to! XSeed added in a brand new 'catastrophe' mode, that removes the ability to stockpile or buy healing items, instead making them instant-use when you pick them up on the field. Instead of health items, a store will now sell permanent stat-growth seeds. This, obviously, radically changes the game. Also new to this PC version is the ability to fast travel between save points, which is very welcome.\n\nThe story is more or less what you'd expect from an Ys title. Basic enough, just there to give protagonist Adol Christin a reason to save the day and adventure.\n\nUltimately, while not as good as Ys: Oath in Felghana, Ys VI: The Ark of Napishtim is still better than Ys Origin, though all three are very easily recommended.

I purchased it in the morning, and didn't stop playing until I was done in the evening, and to my knowledge I have done everything in the main story (on Normal), except for one mini-boss that is not necessary to beat.\n\nThe land you play in is small, so there will be a lot of traveling between points you already know.  And the fighting is easier (in my opinion) than previous Ys games.  The only grinding that I had to do, was at the end of the game and it wasn't even for experience, it was to max out the 3 upgradeable swords.  Every boss fight was pretty straight forward, and didn't pose that much of a challenge; but that's not to say they weren't enjoyable.\n\nThe story is also enjoyable, albeit a little basic.  It's your simple hero washed ashore in a strange land, gets wrapped up in a potentially world changing event, and struggles to overcome adversity to overcome the challenge, thus saving the world.  I do like how it alludes to, and ties things of Ys mythos into it.\n\nSummary:  For an Ys game, I found it quite a bit easier than the others, but that doesn't detract from the fun.  Though you travel through the same small land a lot, it's still just as enjoyable as the others, and the music is just as one would expect out of the Ys series.","April 29, 2015","true","10.0"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","14","19","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/applehate/recommended/312540/","applehate","Apple Hat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/applehate/","436 products in account","A decent game, albeit one of the weakest in the series. Ys is known for its fast paced action and challenging battles, and while this game has those, it is hindered by some poor design choices that aren't found in the other entries in the series.\n\nOne of the biggest issues is the need to grind. In a fast paced action RPG, the quickest way to kill the pace of the game is to force the player to run through the same area repeatedly to gain levels, gold, or crafting material. Unfortunately on the higher difficulties you will have to grind before basically every boss if you wish to do any significant damage and not die in two to three hits. Despite the need to grind, the bosses are actually some of the easiest in the series and their only real challenge lies in the massive damage from grazed attacks if you are not properly leveled. The game also features a weapon leveling system that requires an insane amount of resources in order to max them out. To raise a weapon to level 10 it requires around 6,000 emel (the game's weapon-enhancing resource), and to raise it to 11 (the max level) the required amount jumps up to 500,000 per weapon. Grinding out that amount of resources literally takes more time than the entire rest of the game.\n\nThe other big problem with the game is the terrible requirements to get some of the side items. In Oath in Felghana and Ys Origin everything was fairly easy to get or forgiving enough for you to go back if you missed something. That is not the case in Napishtim. Many of the strongest accessories are either extremely easily missable without a walkthrough or require ridiculously precise trial-and-error "dash-jumps" in order to reach. I never imagined that I would spend more than 10 minutes in an Ys game just trying to make a single jump, but if that's what you're into, Napishtim is the game for you.\n\nDespite these major annoyances that no other game in the series suffers from, Napishtim is still a decent game. It has a lovable cast of characters, an interesting world with NPCs that do and say new things after every story event, and a good soundtrack. The gameplay that makes Felghana and Origin so great is mostly here, albeit in a more infantile state. Overall I'd recommend this game, especially to fans of the series, but keep in mind that this is probably the weakest title to see a western release.","May 2, 2015","true","17.1"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

While lacking all the cute mini games, pictures, and videos that the ports have to offer, this version includes Catastrophe mode to make it similar to other Ys entries in the series and make the game harder as a whole. In my opinion this is one of the shorter Ys games to run through, but while short and lacking those extras from the other versions, this game is still great for all those Ys fans out there and all those ARPG fans who might want to get their feet wet with the Ys series.

He apparently arrived in  Quatera and rescued by a tribe of elves which apparently dislike humans. As usual he's soon got convoluted in a chain of events and his adventure begins.\n\nThe Ark of Napishtim is the first Ys game that uses 3D graphics in the series with a whole new style of gameplay which kept simple and fun. The game no longer use the old bumping system that was used for I, II, and IV which later the same gameplay style will be used in Oath in Felghana and Origin with slight modifications.\n\nThe gameplay is a little bit more complex compared to Oath in Felghana and Origin with the fun to use sword skills that learned through upgrading and sword magic which will still be used in both later installment of the Ys series of the similar style. The other core gameplay remain the same with the 3D fast paced action with some little platformers which was founded by this game. As always, Ys series always have fun and intense boss battles.\n\nThe graphic is pretty much the same level as the one that can be found in Oath in Felghana and Origin, it sure has aged pretty well, but still pretty good IMO, and it is still a good representation of what to expect from the game.\n\nThe soundtrack is like anything you expect from a Falcom game. It is great as usual.\n\nSince the release back then in 2005, this version added a new mode that made this game to be played without healing items and using recovery items dropped by common monsters instead just like the later game in the series which are Oath in Felghana and Origin. Additionally the game now supports widescreen 16:9 resolutions where the old one is just a simply stretched 4:3 resolutions.\n\ntl;dr -> A great game in the series, just like what you expected it to be.\np.s. -> My English isn't good, I'm practicing it now.","April 29, 2015","true","15.7"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

Musics are cool (although not as good as the other Ys on steam, I'd admit). Graphics are pretty much the same as Felghana, and you have three elemental swords to vary your gameplay. I need to warn you about the real difficulty of the base game. Sometimes, it feels like a metroidvania : you're moving too far away from your objective, and you get instakill because monsters, there, don't even love you a little bit.\n\nSo, it's a must have for every Ys Lover around here, and newcomers to the serie !","April 29, 2015","true","12.5"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

The music's entertaining, memorable, and motivational. What separates this one from the others on steam is that Adol has the ability to jump. It's mainly used for combat, with the downward thrust move being a very common requirement to kill certain enemies. Adol also gets a number of other moves, including a triple combo, sword-specific attacks, an upward whirlwind attack, and a somewhat difficult to execute lunge attack. Top it off with sword-specific magic spells and you have a huge upgrade from previous Ys titles.\n\nThe storyline is also pretty strong -- it's not as story rich as Nihon Falcom's The Legend of Heroes franchise, but there's a lot more going on as you unravel the mystery of the archipelago you're trapped on. As is common with Ys games, there are few towns and overall few people, but more emphasis on individual character. Even throwaway NPCs have unique avatars and behaviors, and regularly have something new to say. It's one of those RPGs you may find yourself running around talking to everyone (even twice) after completing a dungeon.\n\nLike other Nihon Falcom games, you get so many save slots that you probably won't need them all. So you're free to save before pretty much every gameplay or story moment and revisit it at any time. More games should be doing this.\n\nMy complaints about this game are really minor. Like a lot of these ports, there are occasional graphical glitches on the edges for widescreen users. (which is almost everyone as of 2015) The lunge attack is infamously hard to execute, which is only an issue since it's attached to a long jump which is used to get certain treasures. Finally, I twice got a glitch where the sprites and/or particle effects would just go crazy and had to restart...but haven't had any crashes yet. Both glitches happened when entering a new area and fortunately a save point was nearby and usable. Xseed has had a good track record with stability with all their ports, so this is only a minor blemish.\n\nGo ahead and pick up this one. Enough people pick this up and we'll be sure to get Ys Seven ported over as well.","June 13, 2015","true","11.2"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","0"

Its not bad looking, but it could look better.\n\n- Content: I would say it does not have as much as Oath or Origins, but it has enough to satisfy you and give you some hours worth of entertainment.\n\n- The story itself isn't too bad as it will pull you in and keep you interested, much like the other Ys titles.\n\nThe one thing I really wish this game was Alma's Trials as those dungeons were fun and it did help with the level grinding, especially after level 50.

Instead of using and charging up magic, you obtain swords that have magic embedded into them. You need to do something different when handling a different sword in order to take advantage of the magic: one requires you to rhythmically attack in order to perform a whirlwind attack repeatedly, one lets you charge up attacks to send out a fire trail (although the fire trail is really tiny, it is very useful), and one allows you to mash attack as fast as you can in order to utilize an electric dash forward. All the swords also have a different special attack that can be used when a gauge is filled from hitting things and taking damage (also you can get a regeneration upgrade later).\n\nThe soundtrack in this game is nothing to write home about, but it is not bad either. It is just very limited when compared to the variety of instruments used in the later games' OSTs.\n\nThe bosses are very easy when compared to bosses in The Oath in Felghana and Origin. In fact, the only boss that is likely to give you trouble in a nightmare playthrough is the first boss because you have no magic.\n\n9/10.\nPlay this one through Nightmare on your first playthrough for the best experience.

This is due to it being the first-ever 3D Ys game, and even though this is a remake, it still carries a lot of the unfortunate baggage of the original, in the form of brutally difficult boss fights (which you are expected to survive by having a lot of healing items on-hand) and some required grinding. But it could be worse, and the grinding is only -really- bad at the very end of the game, where you *need* to get one of your swords to max level to do anything more than chip damage to the final set of bosses, which requires 100,000 emel. You get that much, but you probably need to spend it on your armor first, so you still need to get 100,000 by grinding in the final screens.\n\nThat aside, it's still an enjoyable game and a good remake of another installment in the Ys franchise. A single run on Normal that missed only a few items but saw the majority of the content took me 10 hours - so you might want to wait for it to go on sale first unless you intend to replay it. To that end, it does have multiple difficulty levels and 'catastrophe mode' which is truer to the other 3D remakes where healing items can't be carried around.","September 23, 2015","true","10.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JDrol/recommended/312540/","JDrol","DIO-sama","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JDrol/","249 products in account","After Ys V flopped so hard it took the franchise down with it Falcom slowed down on making original titles and went on a porting spree instead. Not counting EVEN MORE re-releases of Ys I & II fans had to wait almost a decade for the next proper Ys game. And thankfully Ys VI put the franchise back on track.\n\nSTORY\nThree years after the events of Ys V Adol Christin is on his way to explore the mysterious Vortex of Canaan, a massive, eternally spinning vortex located far to the west of Eresia in the Atlas ocean. Along for the ride are his best friend and fan favorite Dogi The Wall-Crusher, Terra from Ys V, who got promoted from annoying brat to jailbait, as well as Captain One-Eyed Ladoc (Terra's dad) and his pirate crew. Just as they are about to enter the vortex they are ambushed by the Romun imperial fleet under the command of General Agares. A cannon blast knocks Adol overboard and he falls into the Great Vortex. After somehow surviving the raging waters he washes ashore on Quatera Island where he is found by this game's main heroines, Olha and her little sister Isha, of the native Rehda tribe. They bring our unconcious hero back to their village and nurse him back to full health. After that the game begins.\n\nThe story in Ys VI is pretty good overall. It's nothing groundbreaking but it will keep you interested from start to finish. The autistic levels of worldbuilding that started with Ys Eternal are once again present here. Every single NPC in the game has something interesting to say and all of them get new lines of dialogue to reflect current events as the story progresses. The main antagonist incidentally happens to be the biggest laughing stock in the entire franchise (those who played Celceta know exactly why) and the final boss is not what most people expected back then.\n\nThis game is also a cornerstone for Ys lore, so if you're one of the five guys out there (like me) who give a hoot about it there's quite a lot to learn here.\n\nGRAPHICS\nThis is a game from 2003, so obviously the graphics will be dated. That doesn't mean they are bad though. Aesthetically the game is quite pleasing. The environments are well designed, the character and enemy sprites are nice and varied. The bosses themselves use 3D models and I still think they look good even today.\n\nSince this is an original Falcom game that was made for PC (the PS2 version is a port) it will pretty much run perfectly even on a potato. XSEED were nice enough to add widescreen support for this release, HOWEVER be advised that the game was not made with widescreen in mind so you will see some oddities in a few places if you play it like that. None of them are gamebreaking though and they are few and far between so if you have a widescreen monitor go nuts.\n\nMUSIC\nThe music in this game... oh dear sweet Jesus the music... After the disaster that was Ys V's soundtrack (just why?) Sound Team J.D.K. got their ♥♥♥♥ together and went all out with this one.\n\nYs VI's soundtrack is absolutely stellar. The opening theme alone literally explodes in your face and I still think it's one of the best openings Falcom has ever made. The rest of the music is nice and varied. You have magical overwold themes, energetic dungeon themes, soothing town themes, mad guitar shredding boss themes as well as some pretty damn good electronic themes for the locations and encounters that are of a more "technological" nature.\n\nI have no real complaints about the soundtrack aside from a few tiny nitpicks that are more of a personal preference than actual problems. Some instruments in a couple of tracks tend to sound a bit too high pitched for my tastes but all those tracks have already been re-arranged in later albums, so it's not really an issue.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nUp until this point Ys had a very interesting reception when it came to its gameplay. Ys I & II ware overhead RPGs and had a love-it or hate-it bumper cars battle system, but they were well regarded and are still praised to this day. Ys III went the Zelda II route and became an action platformer. It flopped as a result (No, children, it wasn't a good game. Before Ys V came along it was regarded as the black sheep of the series. Its only saving grace was the soundtrack and that only applied to the PC-Engine version). Ys IV went back to the style of I & II and was praised to high heaven. Ys V became an overhead hack 'n' slash and it once again flopped.\n\nSo what does Ys VI do? It takes the platforming from Ys III, mixes it up with the combat of Ys V and the result is... pretty damn good... shocking isn't it?\n\nThe game took the gimmicks from the above-mentioned titles and refined them quite well. Adol runs around hacking at monsters as they explode in blood and guts while doing the occasional platforming here and there. During your adventure you'll get to wield three different swords: the Wind Blade Lyvart, the Fire Blade Blirante and the Lightning Blade Ericcil. Each of them can be upgraded using an ore called Emel that drops from monsters and can be found in some chests. Upgrading them not only improves their damage output, but also unlocks unique moves and special attacks. You have several different stores where you can buy armor, shields, accessories and supplies. The best bits however are all found in treasure chests so exploring everywhere is highly recommended.\n\nThe platforming is pretty standard and there isn't much I can say about it. There are a few bits in the game that require you to use a really gimmicky move called the dash jump, but they are all optional and are not required if you just want to finish the game.\n\nThe original PC version was plagued with some backtracking but XSEED revamped the Wing of Alma so now you can use it to teleport to any save point you've visited before. Another new feature that comes with this release is Catastrophe Mode. What it does is make all recovery items behave like they do in Oath in Felghana and Origin so you can no longer store them and spam them even during bosses. I recommend playing the game in this mode since it fixes the one real issue I have with it.\n\nThe game is easy.\n\nOkay it's not Ys V levels of easy (that game was so easy they had to re-release a more difficult version because the fans went ballistic) but it still isn't very hard. Normal difficulty is a joke. Hard and Nightmare are much better but if you have decent reflexes even they won't give you much trouble (inb4 someone goes "b-but you d-don't h-have t-the ach-ch-chievement" I've already done it once on PS2 and once when this got a fan translation and Geis was constantly buttmad. I just can't be arsed to do it yet again at the moment, but I'll get to it. Nightmare Catastrophe sounds really fun).\n\nEven if it's not that difficult the game is still very fun. It has some flaws here and there but this is also Falcom's first 3D Ys game, so they were still trying to figure things out. The next game vastly improved upon the formula and also compensated for the low difficulty (AND BOY DID IT COMPENSATE but I'll save that story for when I finally get around to writing a review about it).\n\nTL;DR\nThis is the definitive version of Ys VI, the PSP port is garbage and while the PS2 port has a few extra things in it's not really worth it (I'd say more on the topic but word limit). Even though it's the first 3D Ys game and as a result is a little rough around the edges it's still a very good game. If you're an Ys fan you already have this. If you like action RPGs I highly recommend it.","April 27","true","38.2"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

YAY! Thank you Xseed and Falcom.\n\nThis game is like Oath In Felghana only toned down due to it being released prior. It was a stepping stone to OIF. However I find the areas of exploration more appealing than OIF as well as the story. Although a very short game, its extremely fun and addictive just as all Ys games are. The only thing missing that would have improved the PC version would be Alma's trials which are found in the PS2 version and also the voice acting but Im sure Konami has all the rights to that so it is minor.\n\nAnd I must say the only gripe I have with Falcom is that they have made a fantastic series over the years, but on TOO MANY PLATFORMS. They are finally stepping in the right direction by putting ALL of their current and re-released games on one platform - Steam. All that is MISSING to complete our collection now is Ys 7 and Ys: Memories of Celceta. Ys 7 is on PC I believe in China. Xseed please release this on Steam. And who knows about Celceta?!?!?  I have a PSTV stricktly to play Ys Memories of Celceta but it is NOT compatible with PSTV. How VERY disappointing. And Im not going out and buying a PSVita just for this!\n\nListen to us Xseed and Falcom!

This time players are treated to the first entry that utilized the engine found in Oath in Felghana and Origins, respectively.\n\nWhile some of the mechanics are dated compared those two titles, this game is still very memorable in its own right.  3 different, upgradable swords with different abilities that also aid in exploration of the islands you're marooned on enhance the combat appeal, and there are plenty of treasures and relics to find throughout the game world.  Speaking of, the islands of Canaan have a wonderful feel to them and add some great ambiance to your adventuring.  The music is also nicely tuned to match the areas you're in and get you in the mood to explore.  I do admit that while some of the tunes in this game are not as catchy to me as in the other games, they are still very well done and indicative of classic Falcom composition.\n\nAdd in the fact that this game (along with most other Ys titles) can run on a toaster of a computer, and you have a solid entry that should attract any JRPG or Action RPG fan.

I liked this one better than Oath in Felghana despite multple rage moments on 3 of the many bosses and 2 hours of learning how to dash jump to a undersized platform for a single item that wasn't a necessity... Yay for more tower climbing! But go for Ys I&II or Origins to start off the series.\n\n[Difficulty - good]: All of the Ys games have a pretty good balance of doable, takes a few tries and OMG WHY?!? fights. BUT, learning to dash jump is the hardest thing you will likely have to deal with. The final boss was a bit anticlimactic  compared to fights and areas in the rest of the game.\n\n[Story - average]: So Ark of Napishtim didn't answer my question from Oath in Felghana about what's up with Adol and Dogi traveling together... maybe I just forgot a passing remark made by Dogi in I&II that he wants to tag along... As for Ark of Napishtim's story, there might be even less to tell about it than Oath in Felghana's except that it manages to tie into the previous games at the end.\n\n[Characters - average]: It felt like there was less going on in the lives of the NPC's other than what was happening in the main plot but at least the jerkface causing the trouble in this one wasn't as grating on the nerves as the jerkface in Oath in Felghana. Also Adol is finally acknowledged as a force to be reckoned with when it comes to climbing ancient towers to stop all-powerful beings bent on destroying the world.\n\n[Graphics - average]: This rating is pretty much the same for the other Falcom games, I love the old graphics but some people don't.\n\n[Music - excellent]: I have yet to play a Falcom game with bad or boring music.\n\n[Combat - good]: It's pretty much the same system as Origins and Oath in Felghana. Although I noticed that the magic didn't feel all that helpful until you got 2-3 of the magic swords. I did find it a bit repetitive that most enemies were weakest to spamming jump+downward thrust combos... very rarely did I have to use some other combo.\n\n[Length - average]: It's only 10-12 hours long, about the same as Oath in Felghana... except for the time you may end up spending on learning to dash jump.\n\n[Replayability - bad]: Other than doing different difficulties, speedruns or getting all the achievements... there's not that much reason to replay it.\n\nDash Jump Advice for mouse & keyboard users like myself:Press a directional key but don't hold it, then press the jump and attack keys at the same time. There has to be a slight pause between the direction press and the jump/attack press. Timing between pressing the directional key and the jump/attack keys is crucial and it does take some practice.","February 29","true","16.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Of all the ones released on Steam, this is my least favorite. Ys games have always been grindy, but this is a step above. I grind, and I grind, until I'm only just strong to beat the boss, then I grind some more and now I can 2 shot bosses with magic?\n\nThe feeling of getting stronger in Ys is a numbers game. Do you do 0 damage, and the enemy does 200? Find a new gear and level up three times. Now your damage numbers are equal. Level up a few more times and now your numbers are 200 and that old monster does 0. It's always been this way, but skill only matters at that mid point where your numbers are equal. You cannot defeat monsters that are a level above you, and vice versa for monsters you're a level above. Games shouldn't offer you weapons that require huge grind investments if, once you get them, you're too high leveled for any boss the game throws your way. My higher numbers shouldn't completely overwhelm the previously unkillable boss, just make it marginally easier.\n\nThree out of five Lennys\n( ͡͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) ( ͡͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) ( ͡͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) ( ) ( )","May 12, 2015","true","13.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

It's not because I'm particularly interested in the story. I've never been a fan of walls of text in games and I've not played any of the Ys games before so don't really know or care about the characters or the lore. It isn't that the combat mechanics are exciting, they're not. Jumping downward stab, jumping slash, one button sword combo and a hold button hard hit. Jumping figures quite strongly since it appears to immunise you to all attacks. It could be because the enemies are interesting and imaginative and they are.

I'll always love them for that. I'd never imported anything like that before, but that's how exciting I considered this evolution of the franchise to be, and based on experience I knew that it would never see our shores in any official capacity.\n\nHowever, I was wrong, and was delighted to see eventual releases on both the PSP and the PS2.\n\nNeither of those versions were pure, though -- the PSP had dramatically down-sampled textures and really long load times between scenes, while the PS2 version swapped out all the in-game character sprites for 3D models that didn't convey the charm of the 2.5D original. I had an "I'll take what I can get attitude," and was still grateful.\n\nBut to see a fully translated official port released on Steam is a real dream-come-true for me. I couldn't be more excited to play my old favorite, and this release does not let me down -- it's the perfect balance; all the original content is here, and none of the art is lost, but it sure does look cool on today's higher-resolution screens.\n\nAt the same time, the game is now considered "low spec" enough that it would run gorgeously even on a Windows netbook. It's the perfect hardcore Action RPG to take with you on the go. I only keep a couple games installed on my machine at all times and this is one of them.

I grind, and I grind, until I'm only just strong to beat the boss, then I grind some more and now I can 2 shot bosses with magic?\n\nThe feeling of getting stronger in Ys is a numbers game. Do you do 0 damage, and the enemy does 200? Find a new gear and level up three times. Now your damage numbers are equal. Level up a few more times and now your numbers are 200 and that old monster does 0. It's always been this way, but skill only matters at that mid point where your numbers are equal. You cannot defeat monsters that are a level above you, and vice versa for monsters you're a level above. Games shouldn't offer you weapons that require huge grind investments if, once you get them, you're too high leveled for any boss the game throws your way. My higher numbers shouldn't completely overwhelm the previously unkillable boss, just make it marginally easier.\n\nThree out of five Lennys\n( ͡͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) ( ͡͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) ( ͡͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) ( ) ( )","May 12, 2015","true","13.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

I liked this one better than Oath in Felghana despite multple rage moments on 3 of the many bosses and 2 hours of learning how to dash jump to a undersized platform for a single item that wasn't a necessity... Yay for more tower climbing! But go for Ys I&II or Origins to start off the series.\n\n[Difficulty - good]: All of the Ys games have a pretty good balance of doable, takes a few tries and OMG WHY?!? fights. BUT, learning to dash jump is the hardest thing you will likely have to deal with. The final boss was a bit anticlimactic  compared to fights and areas in the rest of the game.\n\n[Story - average]: So Ark of Napishtim didn't answer my question from Oath in Felghana about what's up with Adol and Dogi traveling together... maybe I just forgot a passing remark made by Dogi in I&II that he wants to tag along... As for Ark of Napishtim's story, there might be even less to tell about it than Oath in Felghana's except that it manages to tie into the previous games at the end.\n\n[Characters - average]: It felt like there was less going on in the lives of the NPC's other than what was happening in the main plot but at least the jerkface causing the trouble in this one wasn't as grating on the nerves as the jerkface in Oath in Felghana. Also Adol is finally acknowledged as a force to be reckoned with when it comes to climbing ancient towers to stop all-powerful beings bent on destroying the world.\n\n[Graphics - average]: This rating is pretty much the same for the other Falcom games, I love the old graphics but some people don't.\n\n[Music - excellent]: I have yet to play a Falcom game with bad or boring music.\n\n[Combat - good]: It's pretty much the same system as Origins and Oath in Felghana. Although I noticed that the magic didn't feel all that helpful until you got 2-3 of the magic swords. I did find it a bit repetitive that most enemies were weakest to spamming jump+downward thrust combos... very rarely did I have to use some other combo.\n\n[Length - average]: It's only 10-12 hours long, about the same as Oath in Felghana... except for the time you may end up spending on learning to dash jump.\n\n[Replayability - bad]: Other than doing different difficulties, speedruns or getting all the achievements... there's not that much reason to replay it.\n\nDash Jump Advice for mouse & keyboard users like myself:Press a directional key but don't hold it, then press the jump and attack keys at the same time. There has to be a slight pause between the direction press and the jump/attack press. Timing between pressing the directional key and the jump/attack keys is crucial and it does take some practice.","February 29","true","16.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This time players are treated to the first entry that utilized the engine found in Oath in Felghana and Origins, respectively.\n\nWhile some of the mechanics are dated compared those two titles, this game is still very memorable in its own right.  3 different, upgradable swords with different abilities that also aid in exploration of the islands you're marooned on enhance the combat appeal, and there are plenty of treasures and relics to find throughout the game world.  Speaking of, the islands of Canaan have a wonderful feel to them and add some great ambiance to your adventuring.  The music is also nicely tuned to match the areas you're in and get you in the mood to explore.  I do admit that while some of the tunes in this game are not as catchy to me as in the other games, they are still very well done and indicative of classic Falcom composition.\n\nAdd in the fact that this game (along with most other Ys titles) can run on a toaster of a computer, and you have a solid entry that should attract any JRPG or Action RPG fan.

The consistently excellent game play, music, and charm inherent to the Ys series are once again top notch and wrapped up in a tight little package that will scratch your Action RPG itch with refined precision.\n\nThis was the first of the Ys games to use this game engine (along with Oath in Felghana and Origins), but it was the last to be released on Steam by XSEED.  It's therefore interesting approaching this game after having already played through the other two in the trilogy.  Where I can definitely notice some differences in the pacing and mechanics that were improved upon in subsequent releases, this game more than makes up for its shortcomings in inspiration and drive.  This, after all, was the first Ys game to have been produced in eight years by the time of its release, and passion and effort put into this game is palpable.  It's fun, inspired, light-hearted, and runs smooth as silk.  It's also interesting to note the subtle connections between games story-wise after having played all of the Steam releases. XSEED also implemented some minor game play changes exclusively for this release that I can't imagine having gone without, being able to warp around the map being chief among them.\n\nI become more of a Falcom fan every day, and I am saddened in that this is the last PC release left available on Steam as of yet.  Here's hoping we can get some adaptations of the Chinese PC releases of Memories of Celceta and Ys Seven (however unlikely).  Great job Falcom.  Great job XSEED.  Thank you for not letting this one slip through the cracks.\n\nAbout 13 hours.  Use a frame limiter to limit the frame rate to exactly 60 to eliminate input lag.  Don't worry about over leveling if you play on normal.  I ruined some of the signature Ys challenge by doing so (not a problem/possible in the other two games on normal).","March 22","true","12.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's here, it's finally here. Well, it's been here for a few months now, but still - WE GOT YS: THE ARK OF NAPISHTIM!\n\nSee, when I first found this game (and this was the one that got me into the series), I was immediately hooked on it. I played it on Ps2, loved it and kept playing it on newer saves, harder difficulties. It's such an awesomely fun game. Years later, when I first joined Steam, I came across a sale of Ys games. I was overjoyed... until I found out this game wasn't in the library. So I played some of the others, enjoyed them some, but nothing compared to this game. So when I saw I could finally buy it, I pre-purchased it. And the day it went live, I played the hell outta it. A few months later, I decided to write this review on it, because I'm kinda lazy like that.\n\nSo, in Ys: The Ark of Napishtim, you play as Adol the Red, a renown swordsman who saves his crew from a terrible seastorm, only to be thrown off and swept to the sea, washing ashore on a beach where he is found and rescued by 2 young women from the Rehdan clan. You learn about them and their turmoil with humans who live on the other side of the island, you do some adventuring, some exploring, lots of killing and even more dungeon-delving.\n\nYs is a platforming action-RPG, in the simplest terms. It's got a serviceable story (clearly dated, but still fun), the graphics here are dated as well, but it's ripe with nostalgia for Ys fans. And if you're new to the series or wondering what this game is about, my advice is to just buy the damn game, if you're into similar games (Legend of Zelda comes to mind, though it's nowhere near as expansive.)\n\nI got about 12 hours in my storyline, but I did a lot of backtracking, a lot of grinding and you will, too. Understand that, towards the end, you WILL want to grind up and get yourself ready for some epic boss fights. The game has some really good ones that will make you use all your skills and sweet moves, like Dash Jump and Magic Charge!\n\nMan, I can't get enough of this game. I think it's time I start another New Game and jump right back into this one! DEFINITELY RECOMMEND! (though, I'm not 100% sure what the hell the DLC is I have in this game).\n\nI'll be fair and say there are some cons to this game. Sometimes, enemies can be very cheap. Sometimes, what to do next isn't 100% clear. But those things don't detract from the core fun of the game. If you're never sure what to do, explore - you'll figure it out :)\n\nGET THIS GAME!","July 15, 2015","true","13.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you like the formula, then VI is a great addition to your library. It was the first game in the series(released in the US, at least) to take the series into more 3D gameplay. VII, Origins, and Oath in Felgana(remake of III) then followed suit.\n\nWhere Ys really shines, in my opinion, is in being a pretty light-hearted, mindless action-RPG. It's a great way to wind down at the end of the day, or to distract yourself when you're not feeling up to more cerebral RPG gameplay. If you want something more serious in tone, or if you want something that requires a bit of actual thought, then Ys VI(or any Ys game, really) probably isn't what you're looking for.\n\nGameplay is fun, but not particularly challenging unless you up the difficulty or do one of the specific challenge modes. The music is quite fitting, but ultimately forgettable; it complements the game nicely, but probably won't get stuck in your head. And the graphics are, thankfully, stylized(in no way meant to be photorealistic), so even though they are from an early-to-mid-PS2 era game, they hold up quite nicely.","December 31, 2015","true","15.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Try the excellent Oath in Felghana instead--it's a lot like this game, but much better.\n\nYs: The Ark of Napishtim may be the most recent Steam release in the series, but it's quite clear that it predates both Oath in Felghana and Ys Origin, which run on the same engine. The same gameplay principles are here; you can run, jump and do a lot of moves with the various swords you collect. Unfortunately, in Napishtim, this is hampered by poor level design that results in constant backtracking, tedious grinding and generally poor conveyance of the player's forward path. Additionally, some play mechanics are so poorly explained that I had trouble with them despite them being virtually identical in Felghana! How do you manage to mess up so badly that you actually un-explain something the player already knew?\n\nIn short, I was pretty disappointed with The Ark of Napishtim. I'd only recommend this if you've already played the other Ys games on Steam and really need another fix.","February 8","false","11.0"," 2 of 10 people (20%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","20","2","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/elfmo/recommended/312540/","elfmo","Elfmo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/elfmo/","82 products in account","I'm putting a "not recommended" on this game with a caveat: This *is* a very good game, and if you don't have a Playstation 2 (or just really, really want it for the PC), I would definitely recommend buying this game. Keep reading.\n\nMost of what's written here in the reviews is on-point: Ys VI: The Ark of Napishtim is a fast-paced action RPG that stars Adol Christin, an absolute spaz who leaps into dangerous situations with no regard for his safety - as if he knows he's in a video game - while going on adventures, not minding his own business, and killing everything in an excessively violent fashion...typically to guitar-driven up-tempo rock.\n\nThis is the basic formula of most Ys games, and it's the formula of Ark, although playing it in 2015 might feel a little dated (the game was originally released in 2003; we've had it on the PS2 for a long time, but this is the first PC version in English). The core gameplay is good, with difficult bosses (although not as difficult as other Ys games), and intense dungeons (which are much more difficult than other Ys games).\n\nBut, everything I could say about the game has been said here in the other user reviews (other than no one talking about how non-existent the plot is, even for the usually-threadbare stories of the Ys series). I wanted to write this review for one reason:\n\nI'm of the opinion that, if you already own the PS2 version, you can pretty much ignore this version. Buy this version if you really want a PC version, or if you're a huge fan of the series and want all the art materials that come with the game for free. If you're very, very into the Ys series, this art is super-cool. But, if what interests you is the game, the PS2 version is superior and has existed for years. If you're really looking for the best version, that's gonna be the one.\n\nOther than the expanded available resolutions and the additional art, the two main gameplay additions that make this version unique are:\n\n1. "Warp Mode" - An item in the game, the "Wing of Alma", which used to warp you out of a dungeon, now allows you to warp between save points. This is a great idea - Ark is a fun game, but it's a bit antiquated, and one of the ways that this shines through is in its insistence on having you backtrack across the entire map of the game, and then back again, and then back. Over, and over again. This change is a good idea, and makes the game less frustrating.\n\n...If you find it. The Wing of Alma is an item that can be missed. I should know; I missed it when playing through the game this time around. This is slightly peculiar, because when I reached the last dungeon of the game and looked up why I still couldn't warp anywhere, I recognized the item, and I knew I had gotten it the last time I played through the game. I specifically remember a time I was forced to use it once, because there are actually ways (albeit very few) to get Adol stuck in mid-air, with your only options being to restart the game from your last save, or use the Wing of Alma to escape.\n\nIn any case, what I'm getting at is, this new feature that's meant to help "modernize" the game can be missed entirely. This is peculiar to me, especially thanks to the new "Catastrophe Mode" (more on that in a minute), which demonstrates that the localization team is able to control which items appear in chests, and which items you recieve from NPCs at different parts of the story. It's baffling to me that getting this item in your inventory isn't somehow mandatory.\n\n2. "Catastrophe Mode" - After choosing the difficulty level of your game, players are asked to choose between "Standard Mode" and "Catastrophe Mode". Standard Mode mimicks the gameplay of the original Ark of Napishtim; treasure chests around the game contain a myriad of items - mostly healing items and items that cure status ailments - of which you can stock up to nine. "Catastrophe Mode" attempts to emulate the games that followed Ark of Napishtim - Oath in Felghana and Ys Origins - by giving players no stockable healing items, and making items that restore HP or cure status ailments drop randomly off enemies. If you touch the item, it's automatically used, and that's a wrap.\n\nThis sounds pretty cool, but what specifically was intriguing about Oath in Felghana and Ys Origins were the "buff" items that dropped off enemies: pick up a blue potion, and your defense is raised temporarily, either until the timer runs out, or until you grab another blue potions (or red for strength, and a few other colors for different stats). Every enemy you kill slightly raises the experience you gain from the next enemy, stackable up to double experience. This encourages players to continuously fight.\n\nI'm not saying that I can't understand or sympathize with why all of these features weren't added - that's likely a staggering amount of work to incorporate those things which weren't even in the game to begin with, and perhaps not even possible. But, the fact remains that these additions aren't in the new Catastrophe Mode. So, Catastrophe Mode essentially becomes "no items" mode, or maybe "use any healing items you get immediately" mode. You can emulate Catastrophe Mode in any version of Ark of Napishtim by simply doing exactly that: every time you come across a healing item, use it immediately. Or, just don't using any healing items during a boss fight. It's not a feature worth buying an entire game over, especially when you can DIY the concept...and, if you're the type of gamer that Ys appears to be branded towards (gamers who think of themselves are "hardcore" who want everything to be as hard as possible), then you probably already HAVE played Ark without using healing items, just to demonstrate to yourself that you could do it.\n\nThus, my verdict is: If you can't get this game on PS2, this is a great opportunity for you. If you CAN, or if you already do...stick to the version with the optional dungeon content. Stick to the version with has voice acting. Stick to the version with cool new cutscenes, especially the intro cutscene that makes the beginning of the game so much less confusing, since establishes the beginning plot of the game without you having to read it somewhere. Get the PS2 version.\n\nEDIT: I removed a statement which was shown to be incorrect - whoops.","April 30, 2015","false","10.2"," 22 of 98 people (22%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","22","22","98","6","19"

Ys VI was actually quite enjoyable. I'd say my only complaint is that it was actually pretty short. Admittedly it got even shorter due to an improved warp fuction included in this version.\n\nGameplay\nIf you played Felghana, you'll be very used to this overall, including the pacing of the story. The combat is also pretty much the same idea; in this particular game though, you have different swords that you switch between. Don't be intimidated by the thought of some swords working where others don't. They're all effective (on Normal difficulty at least), but have different levels of strength. Where they're different is how you swing them, their innate ability (once unlocked), and their magic (the first upgrade for each sword).\n\nBosses aren't so bad (again, if on Normal).  If you're rushing through the game, you'll run into the problem of being underleveled. In other games this might only be a minor setback with some strategy. In Ys games, especially this one the game, even on Normal, is going to pretty much force you to grind. While I can't remember my exact level at the time, I can tell you that it was low to the point where I did zero damage to the second boss in the game. Only occasional criticals would even damage him, and those were for very little damage. Loaded the file again, went back and leveled up four or five times, upgraded my swords in the process, then challenged the second boss again. I could damage him for more than I was critting for previously when I did zero damage.\n\nTravelling is bearable now. In the original, there was a ton of backtracking by comparison. The map seems pretty big at first, but once you near the end of the game, you really notice just how tiny it is. Similar to Felghana, but I think even that was bigger than this.\n\nControls are okay. If you're using a controller, it might take some time to get used to. You can change the bindings, but only in the configuration outside of the game.\n\nCharacters\nThey're okay. Just like in Felghana you have these do-nothing characters everywhere in towns you should ignore. There's always a few of these NPCs capable of rewarding you under certain conditions. As far as truly notable or important characters go, there are a couple you'll likely not recognize unless you're a fan or well informed. If you've been playing every Ys game that has been localized, you'll be fine. You'll only really end up wondering who the unfamiliar characters are that Adol seems to know, but you can figure out when they met, since it's just filling in the blank.\n\nThe truly important characters don't seem important enough in the big picture. Probably the most important character you'll meet early on and by the end you'll come to realize how little they even do. Meanwhile the other characters, even ones that could be considered minor, practically drive the plot. Yeah, it's a good thing when you think about it. But after taking in everything you notice how insignificant they were by comparison. Even a character I'm certain is the third or fourth most important character in the game is brushed off to the side. He only ever provides one important bit to the story and the rest of his appearances except maybe one other scene are literally unimportant. I could go on and on, but I'm sure you get it. For me personally, this was the weakest part of the game.\n\nMusic\nPeople actually love these games for the music. Really most games made by Falcom anyway. I'll tell you right now that the music in this game is not the greatest. I'm sure people will disagree with me, but I feel there's only two themes in the game that're great. Ultramarine Deep, which is pretty short-lived and the one most everyone can agree on, Ernst. The rest of the tracks are very underwhelming. Memorable, but most are underwhelming. I can compliment the fact that the tunes really match the environment they're played in. That's probably the greatest strength of the soundtrack in this game.\n\nOverall\nI feel this game is still pretty good considering when it was originally made. If it has any real shortcoming it's probably the short length of time needed to beat it. Hardcore players craving difficulty will probably like the harder difficulties you can play on, including a feature that makes the game feel closer to Ys Origin. Check it out if you have a chance.","June 8, 2015","true","20.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The map seems pretty big at first, but once you near the end of the game, you really notice just how tiny it is. Similar to Felghana, but I think even that was bigger than this.\n\nControls are okay. If you're using a controller, it might take some time to get used to. You can change the bindings, but only in the configuration outside of the game.\n\nCharacters\nThey're okay. Just like in Felghana you have these do-nothing characters everywhere in towns you should ignore. There's always a few of these NPCs capable of rewarding you under certain conditions. As far as truly notable or important characters go, there are a couple you'll likely not recognize unless you're a fan or well informed. If you've been playing every Ys game that has been localized, you'll be fine. You'll only really end up wondering who the unfamiliar characters are that Adol seems to know, but you can figure out when they met, since it's just filling in the blank.\n\nThe truly important characters don't seem important enough in the big picture. Probably the most important character you'll meet early on and by the end you'll come to realize how little they even do. Meanwhile the other characters, even ones that could be considered minor, practically drive the plot. Yeah, it's a good thing when you think about it. But after taking in everything you notice how insignificant they were by comparison. Even a character I'm certain is the third or fourth most important character in the game is brushed off to the side. He only ever provides one important bit to the story and the rest of his appearances except maybe one other scene are literally unimportant. I could go on and on, but I'm sure you get it. For me personally, this was the weakest part of the game.\n\nMusic\nPeople actually love these games for the music. Really most games made by Falcom anyway. I'll tell you right now that the music in this game is not the greatest. I'm sure people will disagree with me, but I feel there's only two themes in the game that're great. Ultramarine Deep, which is pretty short-lived and the one most everyone can agree on, Ernst. The rest of the tracks are very underwhelming. Memorable, but most are underwhelming. I can compliment the fact that the tunes really match the environment they're played in. That's probably the greatest strength of the soundtrack in this game.\n\nOverall\nI feel this game is still pretty good considering when it was originally made. If it has any real shortcoming it's probably the short length of time needed to beat it. Hardcore players craving difficulty will probably like the harder difficulties you can play on, including a feature that makes the game feel closer to Ys Origin. Check it out if you have a chance.","June 8, 2015","true","20.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I don't know if it was just me or my xbox pc controller but I could not do the thrust attack which meant I could not do the thrust dash jump so I missed a couple chests that I could not reach. I remember having some trouble on I think Oath with this but finally got it..this one I just gave up but it didn't really matter. The game has different difficulty levels. I played on normal because I don't have the patience of dieing 1000 times in a game over and over again. You can grind to make yourself more powerfull which I think most of the Ys games you could(except Ys 1  you max out pretty easy and just have to be good).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dbahamut/recommended/312540/","dbahamut","Dark Bahamut","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dbahamut/","167 products in account","This is the game, originally released for PC in 2003, which started the "modern" phase of the Ys series, with polygonal environments and a more complex gameplay, with the ability to jump and do attack combos. The original version was released only in Japan, but it got ports for PS2 and PSP which came to the West. I read bad things about the game's performance on the PSP. The PS2 version, on the other hand, has everything polygonal (in PC / PSP all but scenery and important bosses are sprites), which is nice, and voiceovers for the dialogues, which by the little I've heard is not at all nice... Now, over 10 years later, XSEED released a western localization of the PC version on Steam, with some improvements such as support for widescreen.\n\nCompared to the other two games of the series in this generation which I played on Steam, Ys: The Oath in Felghana and Ys: Origins, Napishtim is the one that adopts the most traditional style for a JRPG. Many NPCs, many dialogues, many events, much coming and going, a broader sense of exploration, relatively large inventory with manual item usage, etc.\n\nFelghana then simplified things. It was only one town that was pretty much just a hub between dungeons. Combat and exploration had systems that encouraged advancing quickly and not wasting time. Origins then completely focused on action and was practically a dungeon crawler interspersed with small cutscenes.\n\nReturning to Napishtim, graphically it is exactly equal to Felghana and Origins. featuring polygonal environments which are simple, but clean, having a nice visual style and very well animated sprites for the protagonist, NPCs and enemies. In the dialogues, nice anime-like portraits with a visual style that I really enjoyed. As one might expect from a 2003 game made natively for PC and only slightly improved and updated, it runs smoothly in 4K@60fps in a modern card. The game has a bug in that eventually the sprites will glitch and turn into a lot of geometric shapes flashing on the screen. Fortunately ALT + TAB solves this.\n\nThe sound follows the series' tradition: Excellent. There are two or three songs in the game that really stood out for me, but all of them are at least good and nothing gets irritating.\n\nThe game's story is simple, much along the lines of the series. It has its twists, but nothing that is very impressive or makes you care too much. The central plot is self-contained, but both minor and major events have some connections and references to Ys I and 2 (and therefore Origins, although this was released later), so playing those games before can be helpful to make the most out of it, although this is not necessary. This is not a long journey, but it's noticeable that the staff had a certain dedication and attention to detail, such as the fact that all the dialogues of all NPCs change after every event that advances the main story.\n\nThe way the situations and events elapse and how they fit in the exploration reminded me a bit the first Ys. Except that unlike it where basically half of the game is the final stretch, here when the really important events begin to occur you discover that you are practically at the last boss' door. It's something I've noticed in some other games and is not the kind of pace that suits me.\n\nIt reminded me of the first game also for the fact that some levels are the difference between you being unable to scratch an enemy and it being unable to scratch you. The game controls your progress by gradually reducing the XP enemies give as you level up, but this doesn't mean grinding isn't important: Some situations and bosses are somewhat difficult and both levels as equipment upgrades, which cost a time-consuming to get resource, are important. But the difficulty is somewhat balanced by the fact that you have an inventory with a variety of healing items that stack in groups of up to 9.\n\nI really liked the game and it is very high on my list of favorites in the series, I just don't know exaclty in what position.","December 5, 2015","true","18.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Titler/recommended/312540/","Titler","Titler","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Titler/","157 products in account","Recommended, with certain caveats.\n\nYs VI is the first, and arguably the least of the 3 games which have similar gameplay; Ys Origins and then Ys Celceta being the other two, and I would recommend them in that order over this if you are new to the series. Napishtim is not a bad game, but it's let down by flaws that the later two would fix.\n\nCombat in all 3 is fast and furious, almost like pinball in a way, as you plough into creatures and mow them down left and right; Unlike the original Ys, you manually control your own sword here, and a pad with autofire will be a blessing to cut down on repetitive strain as you hammer away. The speed of the game remains high throughout, even during some rudimentary but fun platforming, and the bosses as always are closer to a bullet hell shoot 'em up than a platformer.\n\nThe first problem though is that the plot is not tight enough to guide you from boss to boss, and you'll spend enormous amounts of time getting lost without resorting to a walkthrough; this is not the fault of the localisation, which Xseed have performed to a high quality as always, but simply because the game follows it's old 8 bit ancestors in having little room for text in game, and plot specific way points that could be anywhere within the dungeons you've already cleared.\n\nThis leads to the second problem in that items are scattered about in some quite obscure places, which on the higher difficulties (my first play through was on Hard) will prove vital; in particular it's possible to miss one extremely useful item by accidentally advancing the plot onwards, where as others are hidden in what you might take to be just background images.\n\nAnd then there is the spawn of the devil known as Dash Jump: To activate this you need to move in one direction, stop, then simultaneously move that direction again whilst pressing both attack and jump at the same time. Maybe it's my old man reactions now, but I never once managed to pull this off manually, and resorted to a Hotkey macro to automate it. And some of the items you desperately need require this to be done multiple times. Later games would drop this entirely and replace it's usefulness with other magical powers, but here you need it, and it's enfuriating.\n\nHaving said all of that, the game is still fun, and I would recommend it to anyone who loved the first or last Ys games. To those new to the series, start with Ys Origins first.","July 29, 2015","true","19.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

After the dark ages resulting from Kefin: The Lost City of Sand, Falcom went to make another installment to restore their reputation, and they came back in a fiery way.\n\nThe story is actually okay, but not really the main focus. The story mostly consists of a traveler, Adol Christin, finding himself washed up in an island surrounded by a Vortex, and having to solve the mystery of the island's ills. Along the way, he comes across legends, the history and mysteries of the island, and eventually becoming a sole hope against events manipulated behind the scenes...\n\nCombat consists of fast-paced sword fights, and the boss fights provide plenty of challenge. One consideration of difficulty however, is that most boss fights become more a war of attrition. For those who thought the game STILL was not difficult, the option exists to play Catastrophe Mode, which removes the stockpiling of recovery items. And like the other games, grinding is prevalent, which may be a turnoff, but is very necessary to advance through the game. Expect to spend a lot more minutes or hours just to get that one level or sword upgrade just to give you an edge in boss fights.\n\nThe music, as always, is the selling point of Ys, and it does not disappoint.\n\nFor those of you who like great video game music: go get this game.

The charm also however includes the two main stories in the game, basically this:\n\nSpoiler Alert:\nA Race War that gets put on hold by Monsters\nAdol trying to get stuff done and being constantly delayed by aforementioned Race War.\n\nAs for the wit...well...there's an achievement in the game called "Just because its there".\nNot gonna lie...that's the first time I've seen something in a game to that effect and I give the game extra points for including something that's 1. DAMNED hard to find, even knowing where the hell it is, I still could barely get to it, 2. ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE.  Unless you ground out more levels.  Hypotheeeetically, I could get into it and be careful, but ultimately between the difficulty GETTING there and the then added difficulty finishing it, just didn't seem worth the effort really.\n\nOverall?\nIf you're from an age that's slowly being forgotten, where you had to fight and earn your feeling of being a badass warrior, You'll LOVE this game.\nAre you young?  Want to feel like a master of a game that's tough as nails, if a little short AND get the idea of what it feels like to be a teenager in the EARLY 2ks?\nThis is the game for you .\nI give this an 8/10\nIt'd score higher, but take out the grinding and this is REALLY like a 5 hour game, and that's being generous.\nFrom what I've read, the games that came out after this are longer, but i'm not reviewing those games.\n\n","April 24","true","10.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
