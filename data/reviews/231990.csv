Yeah, the levels are linear, but you can tell from the opening narration by Stan Lee that this game has heart, and it delivers. Every level showcases a different Spidey villain, with all sorts of smart-alecky jokes, baddie bashing, web slinging fun. The combat is simple, but certainly above musou tier, with a variety of extremely good boss fights.\n\nWeak spots? The Noir Spidey levels try to capture the Batman stealth aspect (Rather than the Batman combat which everyone ELSE copied) and nothing feels even half as smooth and effective as Batman did, but thankfully it tends to err on the side of too easy rather than too hard.","October 23, 2015","true","1.4"," 193 of 222 people (87%) found this review helpful 25 people found this review funny","87","193","222","25","4"

It's a half-decent game that you will have some fun with.  As for those on Windows 10 having issues, I have found a temporary workaround.\n\nHow To Properly Save Your Files\n1. While in-game (make sure you are still using your current save file), alt tab out of the game.\n\n2. Go to the save file location (Usually in Documents/Activision/Spider-Man SD/Saves) and copy your save file to a location where you will remember where it is.\n\n3. When you exit the game, copy your backup save and replace the one in your current save folder.\n\nNOTE: I recommend backing up your game save every time you beat a level, the game saves a checkpoint, etc.\n\nEDIT: It appears that you cannot use the same save twice in a row. Make sure all of your save files are different in one way or another.\n\nEDIT 2: It seems like the issue has something to do with the registry files.\n\nEDIT 3: Windows 10 has been patched to support saving.

Each with their own unique look, animations and an ability that separates one from another. You will need to make use of these abilities to get out of sticky situations as you swing in and out of the action. Who are the Spider-Men featured in this game? The Amazing Spider-Man, Ultimate Spider-man, Spider-man 2099 & Noir Spider-Man... these are the 4 playable Spider-Men in the game.\n\nEach one of the Spider-Man worlds has it's own graphical/art-style and that's a very strong point of this game. Each of the villain's character designs are creative and fit each setting very well. Each stage is tailored to the boss you're fighting, there's a certain theme and feeling to each game. You will experience the humor of Deadpool to the Horror of Carnage. Gameplay mechanics are changed up to keep things refreshing and paced evenly in order to prevent repetition. Noir Spider-Man is based on stealth and most enemies have automatic guns so you have to stick to the shadows and avoid the light while the other Spider-Man offer more freedoms in how you approach your enemies.\n\nThe game's difficulty is a bit easier than I'd like. Maybe thats no surprise, even on hard mode I'm breezing though the game. Fortunately there are collectibles to stretch the time out.  I'm about 10 hours in and I expect to complete the game at 13 hours on the hardest difficulty. As far as game length goes, this game is a bit shorter than the other Spider-Man games or maybe it just feels like it is because it's not open-world. There are 13 levels in all, each one ends with some kind of boss fight. Yet another reason to play on the hardest difficulty if you want to stretch the game out a bit more.\n\nPros  Tons of collectables\nUnlockable constumes\nUnlock moves and upgrade your Spidermen to become more powerful\nDeadpool makes an appearance!\nCons  Clunky camera\nThe hardest difficulty is still way too easy\nControls take some time getting used to\nSome levels are poorly designed]\nLinear gameplay with no alternate pathways\nFinal Thoughts:\nAll and all, I think this is a great game that any Spider-Man fan should enjoy. It has a bit of everything, it's got humor, attitude and style. The gameplay is decent enough to get you to finish, playing doesn't become a chore and the dimension change up was a clever way  to make one feel as if he got 4 games at the price of one.\n\nRating (7.7 out of 10)\n\nThis review was written for and is published on the  Lit Reviews [LR] curator page.","May 1","true","10.5"," 32 of 37 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","32","37","0","6"

It's a third-person action beat-em up with a good upgrade system and fun combat. The story is simple, but straightforward, basically Mysterio brakes into a museum to steal the Tablet of Order and Chaos and Spider-Man who fights him accidentally shatters it into four pieces.\nThere are four different versions of Spider-Man:\n\n>Noir, a 1930s era version of the character (voiced by Christopher Daniel Barnes from the Spider-Man 1990s TV series) who focuses on stealth and sticking to the shadows (pun intended),\n\n>Amazing, the classic and original version of the character (voiced by Neil Patrick Harris from Spider-Man: The New Animated Series)\n\n>2099, a future version of the character who's not Peter Parker instead a geneticist named Miguel O'Hara who recreates the original Spider-Man's abilites (voiced by Dan Gilvezan from Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends)\n\n>Ultimate, a younger and more modern version of the character who's still in high school (voiced by Josh Keaton from The Spectacular Spider-Man)\n\nPros\n+ Fun and Addicting combat\n+ Satisfying Stealth takedowns from Spider-Man Noir\n+ Really good graphics that have a comic book style similar to the Borderlands series and the Ultimate Spider-Man game from 2005\n+ A rewarding upgrade system\n+ Collectables, emblems, and challenges that gives you great replay-value\n+ Unlockable skins like the Iron Spider and the Bombastic bagman\n+ Unique bosses to fight\n+ A spectacular cast of voice actors who have all played Spider-Man in animated shows before including the villians\nCons\n- The camera can be annoying at times during combat\n- minor bugs and glitches (the lighting for textures sometimes flash)\n\n(the Windows 10 error that many people had been experiencing has been patched to allow saving)\n\nOverall, this is one of my favorite Super-Hero games and is an amazing love letter to Spidey fans. I highly recommend this game.\n\n9/10","April 23","true","16.1"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","20","23","0","0"

When I saw this I was skeptical in case it was a poor port, I was very surprised on how well it plays on my system considering how many negative reviews are from players due to issues. However, most of those are due to Windows 10.\n\nAs I side note I am playing this with an Xbox 360 controller and have not touched the keyboard and mouse controls, in other words: I do not know how the K+M plays.\n\nEven after I finished this game I would still play it every few months or so.\n\nTL;DR:	   It's an excellent game and port with minor issues unless you're playing on Windows 10 (check my warning at the bottom of the review).\n\nPros:  	 Excellent and fun combat system as well as funny, like The Amazing Spider-Man can create web fists. The devs really captured Spider-Man beautifully in this repsect.\nIt's a fairly good port.\nIt includes the DLC costumes.\nTons of costumes to unlock, and appropriately fit with their Spider-Men respectively, I.E: Spider-Man 2099 can wear the Civil War Iron Spider costume once you unlock it.\nIt's a well thought out story, love and effort has gone into it.\nIt's the best Spider-Man game we've gotten since Spider-Man: Web Of Shadows.\nIt's level based, I prefer free-roaming games but it's nice to revisit classic styled Spider-Man games, mix it up a bit, ya know? Plus I really doubt they had the budget for a 4 different versions of Spidey's worlds.\nSurprising amount of graphic options in the menu.\nFunny dialogue from Spider-Man and the villians.\nMissions are well structured and each feature their own unique boss.\nNo crashes so far.\nFantastic voice acting, Neil Patrick Harris makes an excellent Amazing Spider-Man.\nComic like visuals, similar to the Borderlands games.\nStan Lee narrates the story.\nMission replay-ability\nChallenges, each mission has a large handful of challenges, when you complete them, you can purchase costumes and upgrades. I think this is an excellent idea as it gives me another reason to come back and play this game other than the fantastic stoyline.\nCons:  	 Some graphics errors (some textures flashing).\nSteam says I'm getting a constant 60 FPS but I think I've dropped sometimes coming out of load or something, again, Steam always says 60 FPS so I don't know what's going on there. These dips are only minor and quickly jump back up to 60.\n9/10\n\nSpecs:	  GTX 780 6GB\ni7-2600 @3.40GHz\n16GB RAM\nWindows 7\n\nI may update this review later as I play it.","January 18","true","4.9"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","9","9","3","1"

The open world nature was still quite new at the time and was the high water mark for superhero games. Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions released in 2010, one year after (arguably) the greatest superhero game to date, Batman: Arkham Asylum. Talk about a tough act to follow. Shattered Dimensions is a very different game, however. While Asylum was a modern day Metroidvania and Spider-Man 2 was open world, Shattered Dimensions opts for a much linear experience and is much better for it in the long run.\n\n\nShattered Dimensions plays out over the course of 14 levels, each centered around a boss and theme. While quite linear, the level design is quite strong and the locations are varied, from fair grounds to a futuristic laboratory. During these 14 levels, you get to play as four different versions of Spider-Man: Amazing, Ultimate, Noir and 2099. Perhaps the most brilliant thing that developer Beenox does with this game is that each version of Spider-Man has his own unique style of combat. While the button presses for the combos are the same, the animations are quite different and help keep the game fresh and varied. So while you may have just bought a nice combo upgrade for the Ultimate variant, it will look quite different when playing as 2099.\n\n\nAlong with different combo styles, each dimension has its own unique style and flair. I found the Noir setting to be the most compelling based on the fact that it’s built around stealth when the majority of the game plays out as a character action game, with my least favorite being 2099 (due to fairly mundane level design and subpar bosses). Levels are somewhat formulaic (you’re going to save a bunch of workers/scientists) but because each dimension has its own set of rules, I wasn’t bothered by it that much.\n\n\nLike any great character action game, the combos are the meat of the gameplay and they feel quite rewarding for the most part. With each Spiderman having his own move set, the combat rarely feels stale and you’re always experiencing something new. The upgrade system was a real standout for me as well. You can earn points for upgrades by completing challenges in each level. These challenges can range from getting all the collectibles in a level to completing specific tasks (getting ten takedowns in a row without getting spotted, defeating enemies in a certain manner). I found myself quite engrossed by this system as it made me alter the way I played to complete the challenges and I tried things I otherwise wouldn’t have. To me, that is great game design when a game gives me a reason to constantly keep changing what I’m doing. Another mechanic that I appreciated (albeit slightly undercooked) was the first person combat. It usually only occurred during boss battles, but occasionally the view shifts from third to first person and allows you to fight from this perspective. Although not fully realized, it’s something I hadn’t seen in a game like this before and was yet another good change of pace mechanic.\n\n\nAlthough I am by no means a huge Spiderman fan, I thoroughly enjoyed the story of Shattered Dimension and found the voice acting to be quite exquisite with numerous laugh out loud moments, and I’m not one to usually laugh at a videogame. The writing was certainly on point and the developers seemed to be really invested into the character of Spider-Man. I’m sure hardcore fans will get even more enjoyment out of it than I did.\n\n\nWhile perhaps not the most complex character action game out there, Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions was quite the enjoyable experience and had me hooked for the better part of thirteen hours. By the time I had reached the credits I felt that it was certainly time well spent. If you are in the market for a fun beat ‘em up with quick, witty dialogue you could certainly do much worse than Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions.","June 5","true","13.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

While some characters may play similar, characters such as noir spider-man, help the game from feeling stale fast.\n\nThe story in the game while not fantastic, is still a simple but good story, where spider-man fans can meet most of the famous villians spider-man has battled in the past.\n\nThe graphics are pretty good, changing style with each spider-man. Such as the amazing spider-man having a sort of cell shaded look while spider-man 2099 has a futuristic look.\n\nControls for PC work well and the player even has the option to use a controller to play. Both controls from what I experienced work well.\n\nOptimization has been done well, with the game running at 60 FPS in most areas. I did experience frame rate drops sometimes, even on a good system. This may be a windows 10 fault and could have been fixed with the latest patch.\n\n\nOverrall I recommend this game to any super hero or spidey fan. The game is fun, the characters are great and it's one of the best spider-man games available. The price may be a little high for this game, but will still give you hours of fun. You may want to wait for a price drop though. I have heard some people still experience windows 10 corruptions, so make sure to check out fixes in the discussion forums, if you're experiencing any. While I did get a refund back when it had windows 10 problems, I might go back and pick it up again after hearing that its fixed.","November 2, 2015","true","0.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","10"

In each dimension you play a another Spiderman with different abilities.\n\nThese Spidermen are Spiderman Noir (I'm a big fan of Spiderman Noir, so playing as him was a great experience), Spiderman 2099, the amazing Spiderman and the ultimate Spiderman. It's your task to get all the fragments back and conveniently all of them land in the hands of your most fearsome enemies.\n\nOther than Spiderman Noir (which was more of a stealth game experience), it's mostly an action/fighting game. The gameplay is easy and enjoyable.  I especially liked all the bossfights, with a lot of known characters. The story isn't outstanding but it does a good job and there are quite a lot of funny moments in the game. Parts of the game are also narrated by Stan Lee, which is pretty cool.\n\nSadly the cutscenes of the game weren't running fluently and I had to restart the game, because of some bugs (glitching through the floor or cutscenes not playing). I'd wait til the game is on a sale to get it. 6/10","February 6","true","11.7"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

A posible fix is to copy the save file to your desktop and delte the one in your save folder and move the copied one on you desktop to the save folder. If it gets corrupted do this, it seems to fix it for what ever reason.\n\nNow for the actual game:\nThe game itself is fun, especially if you like spider-man. I recommend it. It has 4 spider-man you can play as which is awesome. Gameplay is very smooth and fluid controls. I tried with mouse and keyboard and xbox 360 controller, both work well.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Stormreach19/recommended/231990/","Stormreach19","kaywuh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Stormreach19/","373 products in account","This game’s style is significantly different than previous Spider-Man games that fans have come to love, but it executes these differences very well for the most part.\n\nThis game is split between 4 different settings each with different Spider-Men with different specialties.  Each level you assume the role of one of these Spider-Men and chase down and face a villain for a fragment of a powerful artifact.  Each level is similar to a story arc that would be found in an actual comic book (I don’t mean that they are actually arcs from the comics, just that the format is similar), which deviates from the open world formula so many other Spider-Man games have had.  While many people prefer an open world game to a linear one, the linear mini-stories suit this game well.\n\nThe game is surprisingly well-written, has great voice acting, and the gameplay is solid despite some faults.  Most of the issues this game has stem from it being made for consoles and ported to PC as an afterthought.  The camera will occasionally jerk to focus on something of interest and screw up your controls for a second, which can cause some major problems in the stealthy Spider-Man Noir sections.  It also suffers from having multiple actions mapped to one button.  “Q” grabs your opponents, does a web-zip kind of attack, and is your otherwise general action button.  Defence is also wonky on K+M, as left shift is your defensive stance button that must be held down, and space+left shift is how you dodge, which is also typically done while moving with WASD and fighting with the mouse buttons.  It’s not impossible by any means, but it is more difficult than it should be.  There is also a long unskippable tutorial that holds your hand as it teaches you the basics of the game instead of introducing mechanics naturally through gameplay.\n\nDespite issues with the controls on K+M, the gameplay is good but not anything you haven’t experienced before.  You typically fight through waves of various levels of grunts (light, armed, heavy) and end the level with a boss fight.  Thankfully, this game does not just give “higher level” enemies more health, but it actually changes how you need to approach them.  This includes the bosses.  I could go on a soapbox about damage sponge bosses à la Borderlands and Destiny, but I’ll spare you.  This game does not do that, and that alone makes this game worth it for me.  It also continues to introduce new gameplay elements throughout the game, such as the sniper scene in Kraven’s level.\n\nVisually, it is not perfect but it is still good.  The art style emulates the comics and has mostly aged well.  The textures are pretty low-res, and cut scene framerates seem to be capped at 30 FPS, despite FRAPS saying they play at 61 FPS.\n\nOverall, I’d give this game a 7/10.  There are faults that stand out, but the game is solid overall and a must play for comic and Spider-Man fans.","April 25","true","3.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Now that they returned it to the Stores again , we can finally play this beatiful game again.\n\nI have played so much of SM:SD on PS3 and I have unlocked everything in the game. Got platinum on it and his sequel Edge of Time . If you encounter this game on sale (like I did) be sure to grab it. In my opinion it is not worth 29.99 € if you have already played it on other platforms. If you haven't the 29.99 € price is not a lot either . This game brings you 4 different Spider Mans in 4 different dimensions . They all have a role to play and story to follow. The level designs are linear, but they are fun and explorable like collecting hidden spiders and emblems.\n\nThe cool part is, even after finishing every single chapter, you still have Web of Destiny which needs to be completed and missable emblems and spiders to be found. It will bring you over 50 + hours of fun ( my time on PS3 was 74 hours) and it's a must play.\n\nThis is the only good Spider Man game after the Spider Man on PS1, Spider Man 2 and Spider Man The Movie on PS2. After those every other game was ♥♥♥♥ until SM:SD came out. So try and enjoy this game as much as you can, because it's the only game that is newly released and actually fun and playable other than some cheap story free roaming Spider Man game.\n\nAlso if you want to play the sequel of SM:SD called Edge of Time, I prefeer to get it on sale even if you haven't played it yet. It's short, lack of content, and also not enjoyable. Chapters are repeatable and every level has the same design. So it will be dissapointing.\n\nAnyways 10/10 . A great game with a good combat system and story not like other new Spider Man games. Hours of fun and also has a great replay value .","April 21","true","1.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","1"

Worth getting if you see it on sale or if your a Spider-Man/Superhero fan. For a Spider-Man game I give it a thumbs up just due it a different take on the Spider-man game/ story that they have done with other Spider-Man games before, my only main issue is that near the end of the game there are a few to many level glishes, casuing me to restarting the level to fix the issue.","April 23","true","12.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I haven't gotten a message that my file has been corrupted yet. Unfortunately, the overall game doesn't look like it's optimized for running on PC. At least I'm not getting options to optimize it. It's a beat em up with the spin of being four different Spider Men and it's actually pretty fun. Amazing, Ultimate, & 2099 are all pretty good. Your standard bruiser affair with unique but similar gameplay involving making everyone who isn't you feel pain by the light heavy shuffle of button presses. There are some moments concerning swinging that get pretty wonky but the low point for me was the Noir Gameplay, It's one thing to rip off Arkham Asylum but to have stealth that randomly gets you caught at some points and not others and thus completely newter Spider Man's powers and durability to force you into stealth is really grating especially when you can't beat anyone up in a stealth section but in a combat section, you're suddenly as powerful as your other Spider Counterparts.\n\nI recommend the game solely for Spider Man fans and since it's on sale and more importantly, the game can save on Windows 10 w/o incident. Otherwise for $30 it might make you a little mad unless there are optimization options I missed.","April 17","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But sadly I can't recommend this game.\n\nThe game runs well. I get a solid 1080p 60fps on my gtx 960 and it rarely if at all drops. However the main problem is the game doesn't save on windows 10. It's also missing achievements, something the ps3 and 360 versions have. I really hope Activision patches this because if they do I will rebuy this game in the future. Otherwise I'd say avoid this game and if you can get a refund.\n\nUPDATE: I'm assuming activision patched it because the save issues is no longer a problem. Best spiderman game.

In the very little time I've played it has managed to introduce me to interesting elements and unique abilites of every alternate spiderman.\n\nBUT...\n\nIf you've already read some of the reviews. Yes, this still has problems for Win10 users.\n4 Problems I've encountered so far:\n\n1) Save game corrupt - Solution: rename the save file to "Save.fpop" AFTER EVERY SAVE (what a hassle!)\n2) Stuck on 800x600 screen resolution (I tried running it on win 7 compatibility and as admin, still couldn't change resolutions. I tried to change it in the registries - still didn't save!)\n3) Safe mode notification every time you start the game (Game crashes after the notif appears and you have to restart the game again).\n4) Every time I reach a random check point where it's supposed to trigger a scene and autosave - it doesn't. I know it's supposed to trigger a cutscene since I've replayed it.\n\nI will probably wait for around 2 weeks if there will be any possible patches to this, if not, I'll be asking for a refund.\nWhat a shame.\n\n","April 21","false","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I remember playing this game when I was a lot younger and I couldn't even beat the first level so when I saw it again I knew I had to buy it. Almost all the bad reviews are because of how the game would not cooperate with Windows 10. I will admit though this game will be difficult for you to play unless you have a good computer. I was able to finish the entire game with unresponsive controls. Either way I haven't read any of the spider-man comics so playing this game was REALLY cool. What makes the game SO COOL is that you can unlock SO MUCH and you can play as 4 different spider-men! This game did ♥♥♥♥ me off at times, but it was super fun. There are plenty of cheesy spider-man jokes too so don't worry. The game is a bit pricy though. I recommend picking it up on sale. I got this game for about 8 US dollars.
