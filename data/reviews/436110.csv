Just a little note, I'm awful with horror games so don't think my review holds a lot of weight. My toaster could only run the game on low graphics, but it still looks really nice. The light system is kinda confusing, and the character you play as runs like he/she's carrying heavy stones in their pockets. I absolutely love having the bow though. Unfortunately, I didn't get to test it on what I assume to be the main monster of the game, as it was around seeing the monster first that I went to purchase new lower apparel. Anyway, it's a free game, and it's not like you're losing much other than computer space if you hate it.","February 15","true","0.3"," 149 of 164 people (91%) found this review helpful 185 people found this review funny","91","149","164","185","2"

I am amused that such a great game is FREE when so many terrible games cost so much! So, my advise is go get it! What could it hurt? With that feeling, I embarked upon my journey and was extremely surprised. The graphics are smooth and one feels as if they are in ancient Greece. All around are pillars, small very realistic fires in what I would call 'comals' but I dont know the Greek word for them (sort of metal dishes with fires for light) as well as interesting Greek touches in the design along with the music all combining to make the atmosphere just.. awesome, creepy, historical, and awesome. So far the game play involves puzzles as well as stealth in a sort of abandoned looking area with a very disturbing and odd sculpture of a man holding his hands before his face, as if to ward off an attack, but where is the attacker? And why is he stone??...hmm, reminds me of something...\nAnyway, I believe most horror fans, adventure fans, or even simply fans of Geeek mythology would enjoy this game. As it is free, I would say give it a try. It is well made, beautiful and quite fun. I am praying that this is just a teaser, though, and that more work from this excellent developer is on its way. I would happily pay for it.\n9/10 for game play, story, graphics quality, and music (music is actually a 10/10)\nIn fact, I would have given whole game a 10 but I want MORE! It was short, so that's is why. Maybe the developer will see this and think "yes, I will make more to this game"?? :)","February 18","true","3.5"," 51 of 54 people (94%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","94","51","54","9","7"

The torch is used to go through tunnels that are too dark and I'm not sure what the bow is used for. I at first thought it was used for distractions, but I couldn't get it to work, so I have no idea what the bow does.\n\nThe atmosphere is beyond amazing and the dimly lit tunnels are incredibly creepy.\n\nThe problems with the game that it's incredibly short, from what I remember reading this game is a part of something larger and I can't wait to see what the studio is going to do in the future.\n\nOverall it's free so what do you have to lose ?\n\nFinal Rating:\n7/10 - Play It\n\nIf you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments on what you disliked about the review.\n\nFor more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!\n","March 27","true","0.6"," 56 of 65 people (86%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","86","56","65","4","3"

Ultra settings can require a lot of resources from your end (I am not sure if this is a matter of optimisation, though) - this is something that usually only AAA games do.\n\nOnce you finished your marvelling just outside the ancient temple your journey continues within. The admiration stops here and is replaced by the constant fear of something (perhaps a Medusa?) lurking somewhere in the ancient corridors. Using headphones or turning the volume up a lot is a must here; a torchlight can certainly ease the terror but your bow with only 3 arrows will not do so, at all.\n\nThen, when you finally know who you're up against, a chase ensues and continues until it abruptly ends. And this is the only issue Medusa's Labyrinth has - it is unfinished. The 60-minute or so story seems to be polished enough but how amazing it would be to see the story through till its very end. Especially since the notes scattered across the temple give you some background information but only to increase your curiosity and desire for more.\n\nI do not know that of all the 150,000 downloads how many players purchased the DLC content to provide financial support but I sincerely hope Guru Games will get it so that they create a 10-hour long campaign to finish the tale.","May 1","true","1.5"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","0"

It takes myths and legends that have stayed with us for over 2000 years and mix them together in a game that blends horror with stealth into a unique experience."\nGuru Games have done well in creating short but jarring mini-adventure into a catacomb of ancient Greece, which, play time notwithstanding, does well in creating a foreboding atmosphere. The setting is unique and would provide many opportunities to draw on the myths of an ancient civilisation to create an interesting horror adventure. but to make the experience truly unique would require more than re-iteration of mechanics used in other, more iconic titles.\n\nThe length of the game leaves me wondering what could be;\n\nMedusa herself, while she does not actually appear in the game,  is one of many creatures that would provide unique gameplay opportunities. Her myth dictates any who look upon her face are cast in stone. Perhaps the player is forced to locate her relative position using a reflective surface - a broken shield, a repurposed brazier or metal lamp to avoid being caught.\n\nThe game has the foundations and setting of something that could be truly amazing and I hope Guru Games decide to develop this further, flesh out the story and introduce some unique and unsettling enemies. Until then this is a nice little experience while we wait.","February 24","true","1.9"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","8","8","0","0"

I hope the developers read these, because I'm going to make some suggestions. First, this game has a lot of potential. It's beautiful once you get inside, but honestly, the first half of the game I was LOOKING for the thing I was suppose to be afraid of. When I finally found it, I was left wanting more from it. It seemed to have no real personality, and I feel that if you gave it one, it would be much more monsterous.\n\nSecond, I had no real connection to who I was or what role I played. I had an idea, and I understand this is an unfinished game, but there was a story that could have been told that made me WANT to be there and have a connection. I feel that it fell flat at that part. I had zero connection to the character, and I felt I was simply walking a linear path the entire game.\n\nThird, I would back this game for an ending. I'm curious to how much depth you could get out of this game, and seeing as how you said this was an incomplete part, I bet the story could be amazing. The constant heart beat was rather annoying, and to me didn't really serve a purpose on top of the distorted view. I would rather have one or the other myself.\n\nI would recommend this game if you have a bit of time to spare since it's absolutely free, and if the game builds more, well, that's just an added bonus.","February 17","true","1.0"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

There are checkpoint with in the game that act as save points so you can continue the game later just make sure you are far enough as the 1st encounter with the monster as your point...The game does not hold many option choices, as in v-sync, difficulty, etc. The only choices you have for your options are Brightness, Mouse Sen. Resolution, fullscreen toggle (Borderless fullscreen), & sound setting for SFX, Music...There are NO JUMPSCARES, but only monster chases, which are really fun & intense..you have to make sure you look around while being chase and know the right moment when to move so use your deaths as scouting this game gets a 8.7/10 from me...Good Job, Guru Games!","February 16","true","0.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I enjoyed every seconds of it.\n\nI would love to see a good long horror game around the ancient greek mythology topic. You would have to survive each monster encounter in a different way, for example we must hide from Minotaurs, who are fast and strong, they roam in the tunnels very loud, breaking vases and fragile objects around them. Sometimes they would scream angrily (when provoked), making it easier for the player to sprint and do things. All monsters would react to dropped torches.\n\nI hope the developers, or someone, will make a game like this with a good 100 hour gameplay, replayability, intense and spooky. No need for story.\n\nSPOILER: I saw those unfortunate stone figures who obviously looked into the Medusa's eyes, this is a great idea.

My computer worked very hard and bearly coped with the lowest setting but still i adjusted the mouse sensivity to be able to play it, just a note my computer is a new model and was on the highest performance setting ive not encountered this kind of problem with a game before now.\n\nStill i moved on eager to play this game despite the hindrances and was patient as the movement was sluggish from the graphics and few minutes in i almost forgot the difficulties when i was playing, even on the lowest setting this game is very immersive and still very beautiful.\n\nAs I was 5 or so minutes of playing however i encountered a glitch, I could not click on the pages and the torch I carried died but the character would not let it go so i couldnt pick up another, neither could i pick up the bow to carry on.\n\nNevertheless i restarted the game and returned to the part that was glitched, it didnt happen again.\n\nIssue with the monster, first couple of times i encountered it i found it amusing to just play around with its A.I and see what it would do. I died and restarted at a recovery spot. Ready to move on and enough funny business i resumed this time being dead quiet hiding in the shadows and yet as soon as i entered the room it knew exactly where i was.\n(Update) This happens almost constantly\n\nJust for a addition It would be nice to know how many torches and how many arrows you have in your inventory.\n(Update) Although it doesnt say in the Commands [Tab] lets you see how many arrows you have\n\nAfter a while the sounds started to be less scary and more irritating it be nice if some of the sounds only happened when the monster is nearby rather than playing all the time.\n\nOverwise this game is very good and I personally think it shouldnt have been free, I've seen some really bad games with ridiculous price tags but this game definatley deserves one.\n(Update) I've purchased the DLC, I hope it helps fund this game as i really want to play a full version.\n\n(Update) Aw is it over? shame its so short but i really enjoyed it hopefully it will be given a proper ending some day, i look forward to it.","February 16","true","2.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/snaktastic/recommended/436110/","snaktastic","Esther","http://steamcommunity.com/id/snaktastic/","134 products in account","Medusa's Labyrinth is a common sort of horror game. It follows the same rules as many other first person indie horror games, which to me have quickly become the new indie platformer due to how easy it is to produce them compared to other games, and how easy it is to get the intented effect.\n\nThe setting is unique amongst this subgenre, but it didn't surprise me in the slightest. I felt it was going to be a minotaur maze and it was, minus the maze part. The level design is not like a labyrinth or maze, it is more like a single, tangled up noodle. There is a set linear path through this game and you are not likely to ever get lost. This is also a good thing as it means despite being set in underground catacombs, each room is made visually distinct enough to not get stale.\n\nMost corridors are blocked with debris and there isn't much opportunity to get lost. With the intent of all these typical indie horror games being to instill an "in the moment" kind of fright, you would think that the prospect of getting lost in a maze would be a primary mechanical focus of this game. Personally I feel something like that would work in this game's favor.\n\nLike I said it is a common first person indie horror game. You know exactly what you are getting into. The main draw comes not from fluff or story, but from the design of the AI creature you are intended to feel scared of.\nThe AI creature in this particular indie horror game works mechanically identical to any other. It is a humanoid creature with small patrol routes that has AI that can be easily exploited for an easy kill. I guess the most unique part of this indie horror game is the fact you can kill the AI creature. It has funny ragdolls a bit like a souls game.\n\nMedusa's Labyrinth is a throwaway title that relies heavily on scripted triggers and the player to follow a linear path. It has lovely landscapes (just don't look at anything up close), and nice animations on it's viewmodels.\n\nOf course, this is a first person indie horror game, so there are notes to find and read. Again, the writing isn't anything spectacular. It provides some exposition and such but don't bother reading anything written by Alyona. It made me cringe lots, but it isn't totally terrible.\n\nIf you are looking for a videogame in which you are locked in a maze with a dangerous AI creature, I would recomend 3D Monster Maze for the Sinclair ZX81.","May 19","false","1.1"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

And there was never a reason to throw the torch, so idk why that option was given.\nStoryline: 3/10 -- Could've been more psychologically thrilling. Something that'd keep my from going to sleep.\nJumpscare/suspense: 10/10 -- My heart was beating the whole time. Great music timing, love the camera effects when you spot a minotaur. And I totally ♥♥♥♥ my pants every time I tried to run away from them.\n\nIn all, I would recommend that people try this game. Would love to see you guys make a longer version with more to it. I enjoyed the "puzzle" of the map near the end. Definitely encorporate more of that. More stuff like the rope on the bridge.","March 19","true","1.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","33","1","3","2","0"

I thought it was a cute puzzle/adventure with a Greek Mythological theme. ;.;\n\nplznowhyhelp\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fwDBpXOuIA\n\nGraphically it is a pretty neat little game - it's nothing a huge name studio would produce, but for a small company it's quite nice. I liked the fog effects a lot.\n\nI did have a few issues with it:\n- walk speed was a bit too slow\n- some things you'd think you'd be able to walk and jump over you can't, which is weird and removes the immersion a little (thin wood planks, for example)\n- some invisible walls (maybe add stuff in the way in order to stop them. The biggest ones were the sides of the temple outer)\n- When I hit ESC, the window size just went full size and the initial start-up size (which was 1400x876 (o.O???!!??!?!) ) was not one of the choices for resolution (which is odd considering it started up in that size automatically).\n\nThat said, it runs well, looks nice, the sound direction is quite well done and though the minotaur mauled me to pieces, it was pretty fun whilst my play lasted. Good job!\n\n\n\n(Forgot to add that I got this for free on keymailer. I saw the box last second after pressing the button to submit the review.

It controls great and it's a slightly hard to grasp game in my opinion. The monster(s) have too much of a spotting area than today's games' creatures do. I would definitely recommend this game and I would probably rate it about... let's go with an 7.5/10. It has all the elements of a great game, even though I haven't played it much. The only flaws I saw were spelling errors, controls don't always work, but they do almost all the time. The graphics are amazing for this style of game. Also, it runs fine on a Intel Celeron Desktop, that is once you enter into the main building you need to enter. I will be playing this game more soon.","February 15","true","0.5"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

But this short game has neither the one nor the other. My expectations weren't really high, but looking at these screenshots and reading those reviews ("WHOAH!

It's something like demo/prototype, student project or something. Take it or leave it.\n\nIt's built on UE4 so it looks like any other idie UE4 game. Flashy colours and simplistic design.\nThe game has it's build up and tension. Which is shattered by the very first encounter with it's absolutely awful AI. It doesn't hear you, but it sees you through walls. Can't catch you anyway if you move along safe areas. Fortunately there is only two encounters so there's that. Yeah, the game is pretty low on horror part. And on every other part. There is some gimmick mechanics like torches and igniting lights and there is even bow to shot that one rope. Sound design doesn't stand out from it's gameplay and visuals - works, doesn't stand out. But music really sets the tone and compliments the game atmosphere. The best part of the game is it's setting as Greek mythology is severely underused in games.\n\nIn conclusion: nothing to write home about. It's half an hour long game with 10 minutes of tension. Well, it's free because it can't justify any price, but still it's free.

Medusa's Labyrinth trots (clops?) out the same formula as Frictional's works but falls a bit short of the mark in a few areas, which considering the absent pricetag is fair enough. The stealth mechanics in the game could use a bit of polish, the baddie's movement and model are more amusing than scray, and the constant stressed strings soundtrack gets more grating than atmospheric. There also seems to a bit of latency between animation and sound cues, which was a bit distracting. Wouldn't recommend the game in this state, though it's a shame the developmental cycle was cut short as Medusa's Labyrinth could have been an enjoyable (if not groundbreaking) title.","February 19","false","0.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Literally what you see in the video is all you get, there's nothing new.\n\nIt is undoubtable a beautiful game. There has been some real effort put into making it authentic looking and pretty to the eye, but unfortunately that's where the good bits end. Sure it's pretty but you don't explore because A: There's no point B: The controls and smoothness of the game make it annoying.\nThere's plenty of walking around all these beautiful rooms but little or no point in actually doing it as theres nothing to pick up and what you do pick up is useless. The bow is slow, so by the time you've fired, you've missed (even when making the video the guy misses).\n\nThis game could be really good if finished but I doubt that will happen, so as it stands it's a short runabout lacking basic functions.\nToo much effort has been put into making it look nice and not enough into making it run nice. Walking is slow and heavy and holding down shift to run all the time makes your arm ache. A simple tap on/off system for both crouch and run would be better.\n\n\nFix it, Extend it and I might be interested in buying.","February 21","false","0.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I am super terrible when it comes to horror games (couldn't even get an hour into Amnesia: The Dark Descent without having to quit) and I found nothing about this game remotely scary. There were a few times that a sound made me stop sprinting from room to room for half a second but only because it was so much louder than everything else in the game. The threat of having the torch go out makes no sense because they give you like 10 of them and they take what seems to be 5 minutes for them to go out and the game is about 15 minutes long. The bow and arrow make the "minotaur"  and the "stealth" useless since you just 1 shot the "minotaur" and if he does end up slapping you once you just re-spawn 10 feet away from him and get a better shot. The word "labyrinth" in the title seems very generous since it's very linear if you don't include the 20 or so 10 foot dead ends. Lastly the ending tricked me because I wasn't sure if that was the end but it was. If you get to a part where the credits randomly show up that IS the ending. I just saved you 5 minutes googling or youtubing the ending to make sure you didn't miss anything, you're welcome.\n\nTL;DR: The game takes 30 minutes tops to beat and isn't scary at all so if you have poopy internet or have to decide to delete another game to play this you may want to think twice.","February 25","false","0.5"," 8 of 19 people (42%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","42","8","19","4","0"

The level design of the game was boring, I was going in hoping for something much more interesting due to being a fan of greek mythology but most of the tunnel system was bare of any interesting details and is simply boring hallways connecting mostly empty rooms.\n\nThe main gameplay elements are not fleshed out very well, you are given a bow but the only use of it is to shoot a rope 10sec after you're given it and it's quickly forgotten. The active inventory for the game was pretty neat, as you could look into your quiver to see arrows and torches left rather than an inventory screen - but since arrows and torches were mostly useless so was this feature. The game has this stupid thing where your screen pulses every time a monster might be near and it throws you out of the moment completely, making the horror side of the game mostly a joke as it is just not scary.\n\nThe writing and story of the game are not really good either, a kind of interesting story is told left in notes throughout the labyrinth but not something that hasn't been seen before in dozens of better examples, and the notes themselves are mostly poorly written. The plot lacks a solid ending and it cut off in a very cheap feeling way.\n\nFor a free 30min game it's not horrible, just not really worth spending your time on.","February 16","false","0.4"," 5 of 17 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","5","17","0","0"

What have you got to lose other than a short amount of time?  With that question in mind, I would argue that it's easily worth the amount of time it takes to beat.  A very atmospheric game with calming music that occasionally takes a subtle, dark turn (to good effect).  The graphics are fairly pleasing for what it is, but particularly worth mentioning is the aesthetic style, with the first scene being quite memorable.\n\nI have read other reviews saying that the protaganist lacks any depth or backstory, but I don't see that as a bad thing.  In my opinion it actually added a sense of mysteriousness to it, and I enjoyed the manner in which the story was portrayed.

After crashing a few times, I was finally able to get the game to work. Then, I had to move the window around in order to set the resolution to something tolerable. And then it was only after clicking “New Game” that I was able to put the game into fullscreen. Then I decided to try using my controller, and, surprisingly, it worked! However, at least half of the controls were actually mapped to the controller, and I couldn't fix it. And all of this was before I even got into the actual "game". Countless times, I fell through the floor because it hadn't loaded yet-- a few of those times being in a place I had already been in. Fighting the enemies took me several tries, because the game never taught me how to actually kill them. And who could forget the few times I walked into a hallway and suddenly became stuck, because it was blocked off and only decided to load the stuff once I was already inside. The last time it happened, it also gave me a "Fatal error" and crashed. The story is...interesting. I found several ways to manipulate the AI, which really helped in learning how to actually beat them. Upon dropping a torch to ready my bow, the torch would sometimes justt disappear into thin air. One last thing: with a title of "Medusa's Labyrinth", one would expect SOME mention of Medusa-- or at least a LABYRINTH! But, neither of these were found before the game came to an abrupt end and the credits rolled.","March 23","false","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Having said that....when it does get going it's pretty effective at being intense, and making the most of a basic setup.\n\nIt's only an hour or so long, and is more of a proof of concept than a full on game  - which I think the creators have admitted to (?) and it's free anyway.....If they do make a complete go of this they've certainly got a lot right here.\n\nIt sets up a foreboding atmosphere in the first half an hour, as you wander deeper into a very dark temple / catacomb area, with little happening except for a few nicely paced jumpy events to unsettle you. There's some well written notes that you find lying about that build up the experience quite well as they give a bit of backstory, and lessen what would otherwise be a little bit boring.\n\nBut you'll soon find out that the place you're in isn't deserted, and the occupants are none too friendly, or human for that matter.....You have a torch and a bow, though these don't help much as (a) the bow is only for distracting enemy, and (b) torches burn out, and also even with the brightness turned upto full this is a dark game with your light not extending very far. It also gives away your position, meaning you have to chuck it away and move through the darkness if you want to avoid getting your head bashed in.\n\nIt's at this point that the slow build up really pays off, and the last half of the "game" is fairly nerve wracking.\n\nI think they've got the atmosphere nailed, and it controls reasonably well (I got stuck behind some scenery once), has good AI, sound effects and decent graphics. Whether or not a full game traipsing through dingy almost pitch black environments would be as interesting, or sustainable, is up for debate. But this is a freebie, and quite spooky, so if you like to be put on edge you could do worse than check this out.","March 18","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphics are fairly pleasing for what it is, but particularly worth mentioning is the aesthetic style, with the first scene being quite memorable.\n\nI have read other reviews saying that the protaganist lacks any depth or backstory, but I don't see that as a bad thing.

It doesn't take long to beat. I beat it in just under an hour, but I also spent time exploring when there wasn't anything to see. The story of the game is told through pieces of paper that you will find in various places. You have a bow and a torch, and you pretty much just make your way through a.. crypt or dungeon would probably be the best way to describe it. There is one set path, but a few little rooms that you can check out. There are a few monsters in the game, and they can be killed with your bow and arrows, but there are very few arrows in the game. I think I found like 6 arrows in total. You don't really need more than that though. The atmosphere is very good, along with the sound design. The only thing that I felt was wrong was that the sound for the main character's footsteps were slightly delayed. I would say that it is worth giving a try. It didn't really scare me, but I don't generally get scared. Alternatively, if you don't want to play the game rather it be you are too scared or just don't feel like playing it, you can check out my playthrough of the game on YouTube at https://youtu.be/XNT-vqCHGnA","February 16","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Would love to see it get finished and have the story fleshed out. What the game has is very intriguing even though I missed a couple of notes. I didn't find any use for the bow, however, and the stealth elements are very very basic. Still, I enjoyed myself as much as I can while peeing and can recommend it for a play through.

I havent really seen games much like these so when I saw it I immediatly said "Why the ♥♥♥♥ not?" and started my download. I really hope this become a larger game since it has so many quality features. Even though it doesnt give you too much of an introduction like who you are or what you are doing there, that made me wonder more as I kept playing and I just kept pondering about it. Even though this game ended with such a cliff hanger it made me want more of it, like what happened to the character that was leaving behind the notes or her father that said he was going to go find her, things like that make me want to invest in this game. I throughly enjoyed this game even though I am not that big into horror games since I'm such a big wuss when it comes to these things I still give this game a 8.7/10 would ♥♥♥♥ again.","February 17","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It seems like the monster cannot be harmed by the arrow, you have to play hide-and-seek with it, one blow from him the player character is dead.\n\nIt is obvious that it's an unfinished game, but great gameplay so far. from the game description sounds like the full game is no longer in development, what a bummer!

It seems like the monster cannot be harmed by the arrow, you have to play hide-and-seek with it, one blow from him the player character is dead.\n\nIt is obvious that it's an unfinished game, but great gameplay so far. from the game description sounds like the full game is no longer in development, what a bummer!

This game would be a fussion between Amnesia/Soma + Age of mithology ( :D ). This is the kind of game that i would love to spend my money with no doubt. I hope this project keep forward and reach the peak giving to all of us the opportunity to feel the ancient fears while we'll run in these catacomps. Very good hype.","June 5","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The character walks too slow, which in my opinion, makes the Medusa's Labyrinth last longer in a cheap way.  Even so, it is less than half an hour of gameplay.  In fact, I'd argue that a really slow character makes death less scary since the player is practically asking to die, and at the same time, the monsters have to be slow along with the player so that the game is playable.  That's my idea.  I'll be honest, I died once, but only because of the poor mobility that I said before, and the poor aim of the bow.  After missing my shot, I looked straight at the monster for a good ten seconds, and said "Well, I'm gonna die."  Then the beast slapped me good, and I picked restart.  The checkpoint was nice.  Oh, I forgot to mention that the monsters initiated an erie ambience when they were close by that got old fast after seeing nothing for five minutes.   If you've played "Among the Sleep" then you know the exact sound, and overuse, that I'm refering to.  Lastly, the game was easy, but not because it was short.  Clearly, the reason being that this was supposed to cause fear throught the atmosphere more than the difficulty, like other horror games, but it fails to do that even when it uses such clear and common noises which aren't chilling at all.\n\nYes, this was free, but that does not exempt it from criticism, which may actually help future games (and their possible revenue) in the pursuit of the perfect (horror) game.  I didn't think that Medusa's Labyrinth was in the right direction to make a good horror game, and I refuse to believe that many of these reviews would be helping by encouraging others to play a game for the sake of someone's feelings.  Saying "it's not great, but it's free" is not going to make something like Medusa's Labyrinth or its future titles better.  To be clear, I do care about other's feelings, because if I didn't, my review would be one, incomprehendable sentence along the lines of "your dum."","June 6","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
