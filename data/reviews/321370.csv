It feels like it is still in early access, and can use some work, but theres a lot of potential. As a full game though as it is right now, I would not recommend it.\nThe controls seem slightly delayed, and are sloppy. Jumping is a huge issue, as well as running.\nYou tap slightly to make your character move and NOT fall off, and your charater doesnt move. So you hold down for slightly longer, and your character goes flying off the sign.\nI've died so many times because I hit spacebar to jump and because of the delay, the character doesnt jump, just runs straight off the sign. It is very frusturating and unrewarding. You have no control over your jump, once you jump your charatcter will jump at whatever speed you were running at, and you have no control of the jump while in the air. So quite often you'll jump from a sign right into the abyss.\nThe idea of the game in general is very creative, but as a platformer, there are much more polished games out there you can get for a cheaper price.\nThe controls are just so sloppy that it ruins the game for me. I'd recommend this game once the controls are fixed.","October 24, 2014","false","1.3"," 125 of 177 people (71%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","71","125","177","3","6"

I reviewed this game a while ago, and gave it a negative review – based on its original controls, which made the game unplayable for me. A few days ago, the developer Midnart contacted me, informing me that the game has been patched, including the controls. So I gave it a second chance – and I am glad I did. The game is now controlled smoothly and after beating it (which took me, I do not know, 2 – 3 hours maybe? ) I can see its other positives:\n- Good atmosphere – from tense moments like running from poisonous gas, through adrenaline riding moments to overall melancholic feeling of the game (loved the end – no one left behind :) )\n- Fine music fitting the game\n- Clever puzzles – some of the puzzles seemed frustrating at first, but once you realize the principle of solving them, you will feel a sense of accomplishment (at least I did) – the puzzles are based mostly on perceiving the physics of the environment and interaction with it\n- Stylish graphics – although minimalistic (based on sign infographics), they serve their purpose and benefit the game\n\nThe game is basically one continuous trip (not classic levels) with checkpoints on the way. The one negative that comes to mind is its length. On the other hand, if you want to spend an evening or two with something interactive (rather than watching stupid movies), Sign Motion is a good alternative.","December 8, 2014","true","3.4"," 38 of 43 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","38","43","2","0"

The signs in the game provide clues as to what puzzles or challenges you will face, ranging from sliding cars to falling rocks, explosive crates, and poisonous gas that chases through through a large portion of the game.\n\nYour progress is saved after each major puzzle or challenge and, if you 'die,' you restart at the most recent save point, ready to begin the challenge again.\n\nAlthough the game is not overly hard, it provides a hint system for the slightly more complex challenges that explains in three individually revealed images how to pass the challenge.\n\nThere are a few visual treats in the game as you go along, including indicators for how much is left to travel before you finish by way of US destination milage signs.\n\nSign Motion is ultimately a game on level with mobile or console gaming that was ported to PC.\n\nReplayability\nAll in all, Sign Motion is a really cute, creative, fun game that will entertain you for a few plays.  Realistically, you could get 2-3 fun iterations of this game before you've successfully completed all of the challenges without issue.\n\n\nGeneral Accessibility\nAccessibility Options\nOptions are limited in the game, which is a design for both console and PC games.\n\nFor HoH gamers, you can choose volume between master volume controls, game sounds, and game music, allowing you to tune according to what is best for you.\n\nAs a side note for mobility challenged gamers, this game uses either A and D or left and right arrows to move forward and backward, left control to push/pull objects, and space to jump.  These keys cannot be changed.\n\nSubtitles & Captions\nThis game can be complete and enjoyed entirely without sound, so no captions are needed or provided.\n\nChatting/Communicating\nThis is a single player game; no chatting.\n\n---\nVisit Games Reviews for the Deaf/HoHhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/gamereviewsforthedeaf","January 28, 2015","true","1.9"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","17","22","2","3"

It's the story of the kid who escaped from the school crossing sign.You can choose if you want to play as a girl or a boy - I would suggest a girl - you can use the ponytail to tell what direction your character is facing.\nThe music flows with the game and really completes the immersive experience. The character design reminds me of Limbo and Deadlight - you're a shadow in a moderately colorful surroundings. The whole world of this game is composed out of all kinds of street signs - and when in doubt what to do - always check the signs in the background - is the way the game gives you hints.\nThe game mechanics are pretty simple - run around, you have a jump that's heavily influenced by momentum, and you can pull/push things around. The physics of the game can get frustrating at the time (or maybe that's just me), but produce a very unique gameplay in comparison to other puzzle platformers.\nThe game progression is separated in street signs, that represent the different levels and, as long as I can count correctly (as you can choose your starting point in the menu), there are 32 levels in the game. The level length is very different (as your street lengths are very different :) and as far as I can tell (my progress is 18/32) there are no checkpoints, so failing can get somewhat frustrating in the longer levels.\nThe game introduces new mechanics every now and then and keeps the gameplay interesting - from tough jumps to driving a motorcycle, gliding in the air or getting chased by a poisonous fog - and those are just the ones I've experienced, who knows what the future levels hold.\n\nI'm not sure how I feel about the price tag, maybe wait for it to go on sale.\nTL:DR or want to see some gameplay - check out my first impressions video\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=331109340","October 24, 2014","true","5.2"," 32 of 59 people (54%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","54","32","59","3","0"

You cannot adjust the game volume (there's an option, but as soon as you exit it re-adjusts back to the default setting: blow your speakers). The puzzles are very easy to figure out, but sometimes difficult to do because of shoddy controls, or time-limits. Both of which are a platforming no-no in my world. It feels awkward to control at times, funky things happen that (I'm assuming) shouldn't, like getting stuck on corners of platforms instead of landing on top of them or climbing them which the controls call for. For the 75% off price I bought it at, it's worth it; about two bucks. At the full price, it's not worth it.

I like the simple graphics and overall look of the game, it's just what it needs to look like, signs. The timelimits on the puzzles killed the little satisfaction I got after finally beating the umbrella course. Would appreciate a walkthrough because right now I can't seem to figure out what to do before the poison cloud kills me. (All I can do is get a suitcase stuck between two signs.) It doesn't always read that I want to jump so I ran into death too many times, and sometimes I just get stuck on boxes/signs. I hear rumors of a Sign Motion 2 so I hope that one fixes the few but annoying faults of this one.","April 24","false","1.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"
