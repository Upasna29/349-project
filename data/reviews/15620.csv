As you can see the 2600 hours that i played this was one of the longest games i played and if you like more tactical and up close RTS rather than mass production and watching everything explode, then this game is for you.\n\nIn my opinion they also improved alot of the Warhammer 40K models/characters to look more badass, Space marines look more heavy/bulky and...well they just made every faction look more believable and cool looking compared to DOW1\n\nIn terms of following lore they did try their best and improved alot compared to DOW1. but really how can you balance things in a legit game when 1 Marine has the potential to take out a small army in lore wise\n\nIts a good game.","October 2, 2014","true","662.2"," 127 of 142 people (89%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","89","127","142","19","0"

The store page is pretty accurate in describing what it is.\n\nIs it good?\nDepends. Some people enjoy making a massive army and steam rolling the enemy. Others enjoy having a smaller amount of units and managing them using their unique abilities. If you fall into the second of these two, then give this game a go. If you prefer large armies, I'd say pass on this.\n\nThe Warhammer 40k universe is incredibly well presented in this game. The gameplay is mostly focused on smaller squads and managing their abilities. The combat is great with it's array of animations (which you can catch repeating a little too often sometimes) and solid sounds to back it up.\n\nThe single player campaign is good, although I think most people will be attracted to the multiplayer more than the campaign.\n\nWhat I would add to this game if I could would be to add more races (I miss Tau and Necrons) and have more maps to play on.\n\nA solid buy if you enjoyed previous DoW games. Just be aware it does differ from the first and although the addition of Tyranids is awesome, they've left out other races.","November 26, 2013","true","93.3"," 92 of 98 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","92","98","0","0"

You have workers to build up your base so that you can train more powerful soldiers. Resources must be harvested, but there is a finite amount of them. Indeed, this is how the first Dawn of War functioned.  However, the sequel takes a much different approach.\n\nIn the single player campaign, you are given 6 unique squads, and 6 only, to take on missions. No base building whatsoever. These squads can be upgraded with weapons and armour, and can level up to gain bonus abilities. It is a extremely well-executed combination of an rpg and a rts. The story is fairly linear, but you are free to explore the planets and do side missions at your realative leisure (that is, until the space bugs show up. Then you need to be quick or else the bugs will eat the planet).\n\nThe multiplayer is also a genre-masher. Each race has three different "heroes" which act similarily to champions in DotA or LoL. They level up, can be upgraded, and can oftentimes turn the tide of a battle. All of your other units are spawned from you one and only building, so if it dies you're out of luck. There aren't any workers, and you must collect resources by capping points. A capped point will grant you the resource constantly. The more points you have, the more resources you'll consistently obtain.\n\nThe other huge change in DoW II is the "Last Stand" game mode. Three players, each controlling one of the heroes, must survive wave after wave of enemies (top-down horde mode pretty much). You're heroes level up, get more powerful, and eventually die because Last Stand is hard.\n\nIf you enjoy RTS games, but are tired of the same-old same-old style that most RTS's follow, then I would recommend this game (or DoW II: Retribution the stand-alone sequel).","March 23, 2015","true","75.9"," 63 of 67 people (94%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","94","63","67","4","1"

I am also loathe to call it an RTS because it departs from all of the core bits of that game type. There is no base construction at all, or unit construction. What it DOES do well is act more like a real time adaptation of the tabletop game. You command 4 squads on a map to take on various objective. Which squads you take are up to you, within the ones the game makes available, and you can go after 1 optional objective per run. Missions are scored by how you do on several factors, the better you do overall the more XP your squads get. As you level up your squads you can customize their skills and gear. The story is fairly engaging and the voice acting doesn't suck, but also feels like they tried to appeal to a more generic audience than a hardcore Warhammer 40k fan.\n\nReally it feels more like strategy roleplaying game and less real time strategy.  3 out 5 stars imo.

However, it's very different. Basebuilding is nonexistent, you can only have around ten squads or vehicles, and the graphics look better. This is not to its detriment - the small scale of this RTS makes it much more tactical. The Eldar are also far less overpowered, so this is a plus. You gain resources by capturing requisition points and power nodes on the map. The HQ can be upgraded to gain more powerful troops. Squads can only be reinforced when near the HQ. This game is, so I'm told, much closer to the original tabletop than the first Dawn of War.\n\nIn the campaign, you have four squads of space marines each led by an important character who levels up, gets wargear, et cetera, which gives it an interesting RPG aspect. And yes, I said "space marines", because they're the only faction you get to play as in the campaign. Moving between planets does have a great loading screen, though - you see a fleet of Imperium ships shoot off into the Warp.\n\nAnother feature, although this is common to all Dawn of War games, is the army painter - for the fashion designer in you! It brings the whole "custom army" appeal of the tabletop to the PC, albeit in a much more limited form.\n\n\nThere are only five factions in the game. Space Marines, Tyranids, Orks, Eldar, and if you get the expansion, Chaos. Space marines are generalists, Tyranids are basically Zerg (to be more accurate, Zerg are basically Tyranids - 40k came first), Orks have strategy that can be described with the word "WAAAAAAGH!", Eldar are the gorilla geurilla warfare guys, and I don't know what Chaos does. Dawn of War II's Chaos army seems to be somewhat Nurgle-focused, from what I've seen of other players.\n\nWhile some complain about how it's not enough like Dawn of War, it's still a great game in its own right. If you like 40k, I highly recommend this game, since it's great for short battles. The campaign does leave much to be desired for us non-Space Marine fans, though.","March 4","true","55.3"," 26 of 27 people (96%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","96","26","27","8","1"

Fear its divine power!\n\nIf you're looking for incredibly zealous outcries to inspire your daily actions, then this is the game for you. Dawn of War II is the sequel to the original Dawn of War and all its expansions and it delivers in spades.\n\nFor starters, this game is built on the rich lore and backstory of the Warhammer universe. After their disasterous defeat on Kaurava, the Blood Ravens are down to but a single star sytem from where to recruit their new members to fight in the Holy Emperor's name. One problem; the Tyrannids are coming and they have an appetite for planets and everything that lives on it. You control the Force Commander. A nameless, and voiceless avatar who leads a small taskforce from planet to planet to stop the Hive Fleet before it devours the precious planets of the aurelia system.\n\nContrary to the original Dawn of War, this game is focussed on tactics rather than strategy and plays out on a much smaller scale. Instead of base building and massing armies you control up to four units, each with their own abilities and weapons. The game also introduces an RPG element that allows you to customise your squads with new armour, weapons and other items to smite the enemies of man.\n\nIt is therefore such a shame that there is only one campaign to play. This game offers four different races to play as, but does not allow you to play them in the same narrative context as the space marines. That said, this game's campaign is no slouch.

So big "props" to them about that!\n\nAs I have mentioned before I am a big fan of the Dawn of War series, and I have played most of the games. Dawn of War 2 and Dawn of War: Dark Crusade are probably my favorites out of all of them ( I have not played Soul Storm, Retribution, or Chaos Rising).  I like the Direction Dawn of War 2 went with the single player Campaign, and have enjoyed it a good deal. I am also a fan of the multiplayer of course, but I have got to note I am really liking the Last Stand game mode alot!\n\nI am hoping Sega ( and Relic of course) sometime in the future further the franchise with another Dawn of War game. We Warhammer fans dont get enough "good" games. I have got to say if you are a fan of Warhammer, RTS games,   Sci-fi, or any genre in thereof it would be a shame if you did not look at the Dawn of War series. It may seems a little confusing at first with all of those stand alone expansions, but if you have read this far into my review, do it. Go look at them I am sure if, like I said above, you like any of those genres I mentioned there will be something in these games you will enjoy.","November 17, 2014","true","40.3"," 27 of 34 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","27","34","0","3"

Now the UI is cleaner. You can easily navigate around during the heat of the missions.\n\nThe only minor grip is that you can't really hear the voice acting too well during the mist of a heavy firefight. What's funny is that once the battle is over with it goes from low sound to high sound in an almost instant. There is also the issue of lack of saves unlike the original one. This game offers online co-op which is cool. The details are much more improved since the last game. Although, some of the last game's mechanics seem to be more "needed" here rather than just the one game.\n\nAll in all it's a good Warhammer game.","September 24, 2015","true","4.6"," 26 of 33 people (79%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","79","26","33","3","0"

However, the resources you where defending where completely usuless to the actual gameplay, the arena was an interesting idea but I didn't care for it.\nI missed the base building where you could create an army where you could actually flank and use actual army tactics, yes the old one had its mistakes but it actually felt like you could build an amry and have massive, exciting battles. Even in the skirmish mode where you are meant to build armys it takes far to long and the battle generally goes back and forth and comes off as boring, with no obvious units that are clearly meant to be used agaist others and even the ones that are useless for the task they were intented for. The campaign in no way prepares you for skirmishers and multiplayer with completely different rules appling for the each type of game mode, I know there are meant to be differences but I feel that there is too big of a gap and so puts people off playing the other game modes.\nSo yea over all point, this is not the amry building game that it claims to be, expect small squad combat that is slow and tedious where you mircomanage your squad. You can do better than this game, my advise play the older one, as I said before they have plenty of mistakes but are a hell of a lot more fun.","December 6, 2013","false","160.5"," 46 of 71 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","46","71","0","4"

For me personally, it easily beats Starcraft 2, as far as the singleplayer mode is concerned, though. It has a brilliant mix of strategy and light RPG elements that all work together quite nicely. Find some random loot, give it to one of your units and you're all set to kill those damn orcs. It adds a certain layer of personalization. Plus, there's quite some loot to be found so there's always an incentive to explore the levels.\n\nThe levels are set up with a cover system. Green means you get the best cover for your squad and yellow is 50/50. You actually have to set up your units carefully and not rush them towards the objectives. They'll only get killed. You *have* to use the cover properly in order to survive some of the tougher levels. Some of these levels even end with a bossfight, which are epic and awesome, even if they're not all that focused on strategy, but more on action.\n\nThe graphics are, even to this day, beautiful and colorful. Just don't zoom in too much. The voice acting is also still solid.\n\nNow the story I can't remember so that hasn't made such an impression on me. But I admire this game for trying to bring new stuff to the strategy genre. It was really in need of some new and fresh ideas. Relic has done this beautifully.\n\nAbout the multiplayer; I must admit that I haven't really given that a shot, but the survival mode is addictive and hard. I've played that for hours and never once got bored. I don't think any other game before Dawn Of War II has ever introduced that, for the RTS genre that is.\n\nAs of this day I'm still waiting for that Dawn Of War III announcement. Just don't make the same mistake as with Company Of Heroes 2, Relic. Make it refreshing and new once more, just like you did with this gem of a game.\n\nHighly recommended !\n\n[Rating: 92/100]","November 28, 2013","true","42.9"," 24 of 33 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","24","33","0","1"

Likable characters, good level design, neat cinematics, great progression system but it's not the reason why im down voting this. Its multiplayer is flawed. Not only is it not balanced It's really just a MOBA in my opinion. You have a base which is a single building and if you loose that building you loose the game, you have your hero, and a few other controlable characters that you can build. the squads and vehicles you build, yes, they are the backbone of your force but not as valuable and frequent as the first game. When I play as Chaos (playing Retribution) I didnt build some huge army like in DOW 1 one most strat games, all I did was build 2 Chaos Space marine squad, 2 Heretic squads, an Unclean One, and upgrade my hero and I win. In DOW 1 you would throw up to MILLIONS of of Guardsmen, Cultists, Space Marines, Baneblades, ect untill one side fell giving me the Warhammer 40k vibe.

Dawn Of War was an amazing game, and the three expansions only kept me playing it. To be quite honest I was also annoyed when I found out the base building is now no longer an aspect. That immediately switched all the original fans off to buy this game, I almost did too.\nBUT. The graphics are amazing! Usually I'm not one to play games as long as they have good graphics but DOW2 is a stunning game.\nThere is also a loot system similar to Diablo which you can use to upgrade you heroes, yes heroes. We now have actual main characters with a story. You can upgrade all of them with difefrent weapons, amour and abilities. You also get "skill points" to selectively choose what you want your character to get better at. e.g There is a badass scout calledd Cyrus, you can upgrade his stealth to get better.

Unlike its predecessor, Dawn of War 1, the base building concept is thrown out the window with this one. Instead it's squad-based, like Company of Heroes for example, which happens to be a Relic game as well.\n\nIt ends up playing more like an Action RPG really, with you using the specific skills of each of your unique squadmates, each with their own personality and class, collecting new armor, weapons, to change up your playstyle as needed, and last but not least, leveling up and boosting your characters. Hell, even the boss fights keep you on your toes, with their own abilities having you to keep moving around in order to take as little damage as possible. I enjoyed that, and I also enjoyed Relic's streamlined approach to ye olde RTS.\n\nAnd no, streamline does not an easier game make. It very much punished me for getting my priorities wrong when it came to focus fire on the wrong unit. Wasn't a complete cakewalk on Normal difficulty and I'm thankful for that. Though perhaps that could have been because I largely ignored the cover mechanic, which is strongly stressed in these games, yet seldomly did I feel the need to jump into cover.\n\nNow Relic knows how to make good RTSes. Not only that, they also know how to give the amazing Warhammer 40k universe the epicness it rightfully deserves. Now I'm not too familiar with the 40k lore at all, but this game got me curious to want to learn more about it, because it just reeks of awesome. The voice acting's awesome, the music fits right into the mood, and the ambience and atmosphere is spot on.\n\nThe campaign mode isn't Starcraft 2's levels of inventiveness and non linearity, but it's not slouch either. You get all kinds of optional missions to do, special persistent buildings that you can capture that maintain passive bonuses for you throughout the game, that you have to keep defending every now and then against invaders. Though honestly, the missions do get a bit repetitive eventually, and by the end I just wanted to go to the ending and get it over with. Again, it's not because I found this a bad game, I liked it a lot, but I played the Campaign mode only, and RTS single player campaigns are hard to get right. While the old school RTSes didn't care at all about their level design, (build base, kill other guy's base, repeat) Dawn of War II at least gets points in effort for trying to mix it up.\n\nAs for the story itself, it was admittedly clichéd but again, the epicness of the Warhammer 40k universe is so compelling by itself that I actually want to get Chaos Rising and Retribution eventually just to see how it all unfolds. Dawn of War II was a nice ride, but not one I'd keep coming back to for more over and over again.","March 15, 2014","true","28.6"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","13","17","0","0"

You get to play with Space marines, scouts, force commaders, devastator marines, terminator squadrons, assault marines, and even a dreadnaught! "I have come to destroy you."\n\n+A very intersting non-linear storyline. A story you can get invested in, especially towards the ending. Many choices to be made in terms of "Shall I defend this, or shall I let it fall and pursue a more-important objective?"\n+What I think are amazing graphics, a huge step up for DoW 2, pretty dang good for an RTS in 2009.\n+The sounds. The sounds of glorious battle. The sounds are great.\n+A huge variety of weapons and armor to equip you 6 squads with.\n+Each mission has a "boss" that challenges you once you fight through hordes of their minions, keeping things challenging.\n\nUnfortuntaely due to its age its multiplayer is nearly-dead, I could not find a match. Though I could find a match to the arena-based 3 player coop mode.That is fun but not many people are still playing that either. It plays just like the singleplayer game except you control one unit rather than a squad or several squads. Speaking of that, the singleplayer campaign allows for 2 player coop as well, I didn't have a friend to try it with though.\n\nI've got to give this game a 9/10, easy. This game trumps almost all others in its genre. It is not perfect, but it is a hell of a lot of fun. I definitely recommend anyone pick it up. $20 seems a bit steep since the multiplayer is dead but if you enjoy singleplayer and coop, maybe you have some friends that will play it with you?

I have played first Dawn of War when it was released + DLC Winter Assault and I really liked it a lot. Dawn of War II graphics is way better, gameplay has been changed but I enjoyed this one as well. Missions are now divided into 3 types - story missions, "normal" missions and defend missions. Story and normal missions are basically the same, story missions just drive the story forward. Anyway, it gets repetitive after some time, as its always the same during whole game - deployment of troops into sector, destroying the enemy, capture all strategic points on map and at the end kill some boss - stronger enemy unit. Together with limited number of maps it gets boring sometimes. At least devs included defend missions where cca 3-4 waves of enemies is trying to destroy your acquired strategic point and you need to defend 3 generators. The best way how to enjoy the game is keep some time between playing it or play something else until you have again need to play this. Why? Because its fun! Its fun to watch how your Space Marines troops are crushing your enemies, its fun to listen to their comments, its fun to improve their skills (yes, there are some RPG elements here), to equip them with better weapons/gears etc. Anyway, I would definitely recommend this game. My personal rating - 8/10","September 24, 2014","true","50.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The missions are challenging, the atmosphere is great and the cutscenes really add to the atmosphere (and I am not a fan of cutscenes). Highly recommended. Plus Relic are definitely good guys when it comes to long term support.\n\nFull marks to Relic for patching out the awful Games for Windows Live and replacing it with Steamworks. They did not have to, but chose to and for that I think they are very cool and it makes me far more likely to buy future games (Dawn of War 3 please!)\n\nDawn of War 2 is a really great adaptation of the 40k universe - it strips out the base building of Dawn of War 1 and focusses on small units and heroes, which is much closer to the fiction and the miniatures game. Some people did not like that, but I definitely did. You control up to 4 squads (or 2 squads each if you are playing co-op) and fight a variety of foes each of which benefit from different strategies of attack. There is also a larger meta-game element of controlling various resource sites and that works pretty well too.\n\nAll in all I highly rate Dawn of War 2 and Chaos Rising.","July 27, 2014","true","40.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Dawn of War II has more in common with Relic's Company of Heroes series then it does the original Dawn of War, in single-player games anyways, as you are only in command of small groups of Space Marines. No massive armies of vehicles, fliers and Squiggoths in this one.\n\nDespite the reduced scale, Dawn of War II is still one of the best squad-based RTS games available. The graphics still look good, the music is the typical "epic" soundtrack and matches the grim dark setting. Control is perhaps the largest issue as it can be hard to get your squads to go into cover and it gets tough to pick out enemy characters.  Keyboard hotkeys help but it's still annoying.\n\nAll told, for the price, Dawn of War II is a great pick up if you want a small scale RTS or just a decent game in the 40k Universe.","October 31, 2014","true","30.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The squad based nature of the game and customization options allow for a tactical depth that the first game only barely scratched the surface of, and the campaign missions are consistently entertaining.

Somewhere between the two games, Relic released another stellar RTS (Company of Heroes) that fundamentally changed the way RTS games play; it was a game less focused on base building and throwing huge armies at each other, but more focused on advancing technology and tactical engagements.  Dawn of War II takes over from there, and iterates the formula into the 40K setting.  Gone are the micromanaged bases and huge armies of Dawn of War fighting Epic-like battles.  You will lead smaller and fewer squads and named heroes, with ability progression and customizable wargear, choose your battles on a campaign map, receive rewards/loot, customize your hero and ultimately stick it to the filthy Xenos.  Don't jump in expecting Starcraft/C&C type of RTS gameplay, keep an open mind, and you will be rewarded with an incredibly rewarding campaign experience leading the Blood Ravens and their familiar heroes to victory and salvation.  Dawn of War II has graphics that still measure up to this day, and its requirements should be a piece of cake for any modern system.  Its campaign coop is incredibly fun, so I strongly suggest that you nag a friend into buying it with you.  Final caveat: Do not buy it for its multiplayer; for that, buy the standalone expansion Dawn of War II: Retribution.","December 7, 2015","true","73.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The Campaign is the best mode in my opinion or the online area modes and you won't be constructing buildings at all, all you will do in the regular 1 vs 1 mode is producing units. Controlling units, bases and manage economy but there are no build orders you just upgrade your current base to build more units.\n\nA lot of people, myself included did not like this change. I am a big fan of 4X, strategy and RTS games, but this is more of a RPG, I would say the campaign itself is totally worth it if you buy it on a sale, then go ahead, and get ready to gear up your own space marine squad.\n\nAnd the customization in the campaign is awesome, you want to give Terminator Armour to Assault Marines? They pick up the Thunder Hammers, give it to your marines and they turn into regular old Terminators, want some extra range for your assault gun-carrying Termies? Then give 'em the good cyclone missle launcher and let loose havoc.\n\nThe campaign really is the peak of this game and it lets you play from many different angles, but do keep in mind from an RTS point of view, Dawn of War I is the better multiplayer online game. But DoW also lets you play co-op in the campaign so if you just want to enjoy the Epic Space Marine bad assery with friends then totally pick this game up.","October 11, 2014","true","30.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Here the player relies now more than ever on using terrain for squad, and structures as vantage points. This creates the pacing for multiplayer matches to become more about capture points rather than destruction of your enemy base. They have also removed creating tech tree structures, and streamlined the tech tree onto a single building.\n\nYou still have your unit upgrades per squad, and your race specific Heroes. But the cost for upgrades have increased, thus putting more weight onto fewer decisions. Replenishing squad units aren’t on the fly anymore, healing is only available at base. And, since there’s no mention of constructing a new base, you have only one location to heal, your starting point.\n\nA match last about 30 minutes. However, the balancing feels a bit tilted. On a classic destruction game mode, if you control all the resources on the field within 10 minutes, you’ll find yourself spending the other 20 minutes trying to just break their base... unless if the AI happened to obtain unlimited resources, it appears they can heal almost indefinitely without any resource nodes. This is why they’ve probably added and defaulted the game mode to Capture Points, where you win by controlling the nodes.\n\nIf you want to compare this to other game genres, this would be similar to playing a DoTA/MoBA but with a single player controlling all the units on the field. While enjoyable to play, Dawn of War 2 is not my cup of tea.","September 26, 2015","false","2.0"," 25 of 45 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","25","45","0","4"

The quick and easy answer is of course a most definite YES!, and I think for two very good reasons.\n\nI will go ahead and put as the #1 reason is that, given how long this game has been out, the developers Relic Entertainment is in my opinion one the best video game development studios to have ever come along. They have done such an incredible job with the way they made this game. Everything from the production values to the voice over acting is just a perfect example of putting big budget resources to good use.\n\nAnother thing about this is, if you take a moment to look at the news and announcements pages for these games, Relic  is supporting this series and franchise to its fullest extent. There are lots of updates and general postings being made about these games on a constant basis to this day. Good communication with your player base goes a loooong way to helping people make good decisions about what games they should buy.\n\nThe #2 reason I could recommend getting this series and games, is that the level of polish and overall feel of the games themselves is very top notch. These games run extremely well across a huge variety of PC configurations, low end systems to the very latest PC's. Along with this is that these games play very good without huge game-breaking bugs ruining your playing experience, seems like Relic did a great job with making sure as many bugs were taken care of before they released this series a long time ago, in general I found that all of Relic's older games including CoH, The Homeworld series, etc. were done very well.\n\nSome of the other things I enjoy about this series is that while I don't know a whole lot about the Warhammer Universe, I thought the story and characters are good enough to be interesting. Great campaign play, Good multiplayer action, and just altogether a solid, nicely done game series.\n\nAnd lastly, I should go ahead and mention specifically that the DoW II games are just slightly different from the original W40K DoW series. The original DoW series had a classic C&C base-building, resource gathering model while the DoW II series switches over and gets rid that in favor of a squad based, heroes model.\n\nSome people were surprised at the change, some liked it while others didn't, in my opinion it looked as if they wanted to go the other direction and that was fine. I would recommend in fact that anybody who wonders what the big difference is, is to maybe watch a youtube game review/let's play video that way you could see for yourself and decide that way because no one but you can decide if you would like that or not.\n\n","March 27, 2015","true","11.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

While it tossed out Base Building for a more streamlined approach, it did so with flying colors combining Diablo style loot drops with an RPG leveling system and an extensive skill tree.\n\nPros: +Decent story with likeable characters\n+Excellent loot, weapon, armor, and class variety\n+Great graphics and animations that still hold up to todays standards for RTS games, especially for 2009\n+TONS OF CONTENT! On top of a 20+ hour campaign that is highly replayable, you have Co-Op on top of that. (The online modes should be played exclusively on DoW II Retribution though as that has ALL the factions and the majority of the community.)\n+Fantastic combat with great enemy variety, boss battles, special enemy types, and lots of guns, powers, and toys to play around with\n+Huge open maps meant for exploration to find loot and other goodies as well as mop up any enemies to rack the experience points.\n+Decent mission variety with story missions being the most focused with optional Assassination and Defense missions to spice it up\n+The voice acting is SUPERB with some of the best game actors in the biz working it, including Steve Blum, aka Spike from Cowboy Beebop in this game as a grizzled Sniper expert\n+ITS WARHAMMER 40K! If you love the franchise like I do you will be splooging at all the detail, lore, and awesome stuff that helps build upon the license and makes you giddy just to feel like youre in the universe of W40K\n\nCon: -Graphics are great overall, but there is some serious texture quality that is left to be desired, like the ground for instance\n-While the maps are expansive and fun to explore they repeat them CONSTANTLY in the game. It gets repeitive doing the same maps over and over, but it's the quality of the gameplay and the map design that save this unfortunate problem\n-Cant respec skill tree :(\n-Still suffers from bugs. Nothing major, but there are occasional animation bugs where units may get stuck or cant move, and enemies who get killed may fly in circles around the map. It's actually kind of funny when you see that one though\n-Along with repeating maps the missions themselves feel very repetitive after a while. It's the differing enemy types and awesome loot drops that encourage you to play these and save this unforunate repetition\n-While the writing is passable by W40K fans, most people will see it as stock and cliche. It really is the setting and license that hold it up. The characters are memorable and likeable enough, but fairly one dimensional in personality and you really need to listen to a LOT of their dialog to feel invested\n\nOVERALL: Fantastic\nI mean no exageration when I award this a 9.5/10 as a W40K fan. As an RTS/RPG fan, I award it an 8.5 for those not familiar with W40K. An excellent game none the less and one of my favorite games of all time and my favorite RTS alongside StarCraft II.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/drmircow/recommended/15620/","drmircow","Dr. Mircow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/drmircow/","677 products in account","Heresy!\n\nWhat do you get when you take a different, albeit risky, spin on a popular franchise? You get Dawn of War II, a squad/tactics-based strategy game set in the Warhammer 40,000 universe which is also the first proper sequel in the Dawn of War series.\n\nWhat is striking in Dawn of War II is how Relic decided to throw away all of the base-building and army management mechanics - staples of the strategy genre - and focus on squad/tactics-based mechanics instead where you can control of up to four (out of six) unique squads and capture points throughout various missions in the campaign. In other words, it is something like taking exclusive control of heroes in Warcraft 3. On top of that, light RPG mechanics were seamlessly implemented to give a bit more depth to the gameplay by allowing the player to level up their squads, assigning attribute points, unlocking new abilities, collecting dropped loot and customizing war-gears to their will; essentially a character progression system. These RPG mechanics, while basic, do provide some diversity in tactics when preparing for a mission.\n\nWith no prior knowledge of Warhammer 40,000’s lore, aside from these Space Marines worshipping this Emperor of theirs and barbarically killing Tyranids (and other races), as if they are BJ Blazkowicz on steroids, Dawn of War II is actually capable of providing an interesting and somewhat immersive story, albeit nothing new to this genre though, with a fairly strong narrative even to someone who knows absolutely nothing about the Warhammer universe, like myself. About an hour or so in the campaign, you will quickly familiarise yourself with the lore in no time. However, this time around you are allowed to play whichever mission your heart desires in the campaign, with each pick having a certain consequence depending on its objectives. If you want to take a break from the main story-missions, distress calls act as secondary missions for you to complete within a limited time, despite most of them getting generic after a time. At least this creates a layer of non-linearity in the campaign, even if it is all just an illusion. And once again, unquestionable high production values all around coming from someone like Relic, especially in its visuals and voice acting. Where do they find these voice actors?\n\nRelic has been known for making good campaigns in their games, even memorable ones as seen in Company of Heroes, but ultimately everyone plays these games for the multiplayer. And there is no denying that Relic did well here too, again. With co-op added, it is possible to play the campaign with a friend and/or battle against each other in either the Victory Point Control or Annihilation modes. But the real meat of the multiplayer is in the Last Stand mode where you have to survive waves of AI controlled units. It is simply addicting and so much fun to play in this mode, especially with a group of friends. No wonder most current servers just run the Last Stand mode, because it is that popular.\n\nSadly where Dawn of War II falls short is in its small and quite uninspiring map designs, repetitiveness in some of its mission objectives and levels, underwhelming boss-fights, squads’ poor path-finding and the lack of other playable races in the campaign (see the expansions packs); having different perspectives from different factions is always a bonus in a story. Also, once you clear out the campaign, there is little reason for coming back to it straightaway since the story, while pretty good, is not worth another playthrough for quite some time; unless you want to play on a higher difficulty, collect all of the achievements or maybe delve into co-op with a friend.\n\nAnd frankly, while the gameplay is probably not as deep (as you may wanted it to be), it can still deliver plenty of hours of fun regardless. Come to think of it, the reason why it is fun is because it is simplified, stripped down from its original roots. No more headaches from micromanaging all your troops across big maps. In actual fact, it is almost like playing a MOBA game, minus some aspects and without that overwhelming depth in gameplay. Moreover, due to the small size of most maps, a mission can take can up to around 15 minutes to complete, with multiplayer matches lasting potentially longer depending on skills. This eliminates the possibility of long-winded plays and getting tired by them, although this is fairly subjective.\n\nIn conclusion, Dawn of War II is a good example where a developer took the risk to try something dynamically new on a popular and acclaimed franchise to at least satisfactory results. Whether this might have caused them to lose some hardcore fans whilst also gaining new ones, I personally do not care. It is a solid squad/tactics-based strategy game nonetheless, backed up by a story faithful to the Warhammer universe, a well-written narrative, high production values (as we are accustomed from Relic) and a strong multiplayer component thanks to its co-op and Last Stand mode, but definitely not without glaring flaws. Overall nothing mind-blowing, but it is tons of fun. If you are looking for a straightforward traditional RTS, either pick the original Dawn of War or try any other RTS out there instead, if you are desperately missing the good-old base-building and army management mechanics. Otherwise, this is a solid recommendation regardless if you know anything about Warhammer in general.\n\nAnd who needs to wear a helmet in combat when you have oversized body armours which weight a tonne and have jump packs? Crazy, I know. And very impractical.","June 7, 2015","true","22.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","3"

Every mission is basically just land, kill some orcs, reactivate some things, go find a generic looking orc boss (with generic voice acting and generic video game boss type abilities) and kill him. I played 5 missions, but felt as if I had played only 1 mission because they were all the same.\n\nThe missions are connected by what I would very hesitantly call a primitive "storyline". It basically consists of some voice-acted space marine saying some generic stuff like "ok well there's this big ork guy and he's causing problems, go kill him". Every mission briefing is pretty much exactly that phrase re-worded to give the illusion of unique missions. The mission content itself doesn't differ much either. Maybe instead of fighting shoota boys, you're fighting stromboys. Or instead of killing an orc warboss in a canyon, you're killing an orc warboss on a mountain top. Or instead of killing ork warboss A who did this one bad thing, you're killing ork warboss B who did another bad thing. See where I'm going with this? You would think that RTS games would have learned from the game design which Blizzard pioneered which included vibrant characters and storylines.\n\nThe actual mechanics of the gameplay as lacking as well. One thing that makes squad combat games awesome as opposed to army combat/basebuilding games is that you can focus on more meaningful and deep strategic elements relating to the combat engagements themselves. Ostensibly, with less things to control, the micromanagement of what you do control can be more complex. Not so with this game. What you're able to do with a few squads is pretty much the same thing you do with mass engagements. You activate one or two powers or utlility items for max efficiency and that's pretty much it. In other words, all the boring stuff. It's clicky micromanagement and not STRATEGICAL micromanagement. Think the hero missions in starcraft and warcraft, only slowed down.\n\nNow true, you can take cover. However, most of the time it isn't necessary and doesn't exactly constitute high tactics. It just means that the game is clicky: click for cover, click to shoot, click to activate ability, click to pick up items, rinse and repeat. The only curve ball that forces you to adapt is when enemies throw grenades or a boss marks a circle of ground that he will soon jump on. But all you have to do is micro your squad away from it and move them back. Again, it's the tedious and boring kind of micro (and not that hard either), as opposed to the strategical kind of micro. This game doesn't encourage careful thinking, risk vs. reward, and lot of out-of-the-box thinking. Some tactics that I came up with were immediately shut down by the game. For example, you can't lure enemies into a killzone because they have a leash. Hit and run or guerilla type tactics don't work for the same reason. Scout units are largely worthless because you can see enemies farther away than they can see you. Basically, the player is forced to play the game one way. You don't even need to think about how best to use limited use items either because the game constantly re-supplies you.\n\nMoving on to the other areas. This game has a very rudimentary character progression system. You can assign some stat points. There are only 4 stats though, and they all progress in a linear fashion with little player input. To go along with this system is a gear collection system. It's very incremental and done with the classic white/green/blue scale. Some weapons and armors are objectively better than others, removing any sense of tactical considerations. The right way to do this would to have lots of gear, none of which is better or worse, but just has different tactical implications. Sadly, none of the gear changes the way you approach battles too much, opting to give you better armor or damage or health instead.\n\nAs far as production value, I would say the graphics are fine but the voice acting sucks. The layout of the hud and menus is rather poor as well.\n\nOverall this game is below average standards for RTS games. I bought it for 5 bucks on a sale and wish I could get my money back.","February 24","false","1.6"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","1"

The previous game had some of that too, but definitely a lot of economy and base building too. None of that here though, this is purely a combat game.\n\nYour heroes level up as they purge the xenos (that's Space Marine for killing just about everything) and each level up grants them a passive stat boost, 2 skill points and access to better gear (which drops randomly from enemies you kill, almost like an ARPG, but fortunately not quite as frequently).\nThese skill points (and your choice of weapon type and accessories) are your primary means of customization, and you can spend them on 4 attributes. Health, Ranged, Melee and Energy. The first 3 are self-explanatory, and Energy just gives you more "mana" to use your abilities in battle. What elevates this system to something far more strategic though, is that specific levels in an attribute can give very specific effects. For example, putting 3 points in Energy could unlock an additional accessory slot or allow your units to equip plasma rifles.\nThere aren't enough skill points to get everything though, as the maximum level is 20 (for your units anyway, I've seen enemy AI with level 27 units... I hate it when games do that).

Sub-sector Aurelia is important to every 40k race, and as the Imperium presence is overrun with Orks the Blood Ravens are called in. This quickly escalates into a conflict against the insidious Eldar and relentless Tyranid as well.\n\nIn general I had a great time with this game, and I'd definitely recommend it.\nYou're still only able to play as the Space Marines, and they're still stupidly serious about everything, but as a power fantasy they definitely deliver.","February 28, 2015","true","14.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Yes it’s based in the 40K universe, Space Marines battling Orks etc. But that is it, Dawn of War 2 is a game in its own right, you will not be amassing squads of soldiers capturing strategic locations to earn more points so you can build more units faster. In fact the main emphasis will be around a small group of rock hard units which you will take (or not) on missions amass experience and hopefully pick up wargear. Dawn of War was a RTS pure and simple, Dawn of War 2 is a cross between RTS and RPG. I enjoyed playing the game in its own right and would highly recommend it for both RTS, RPG and 40K fans.","November 6, 2015","true","35.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Along with these modes there is also the Last Stand mode where you and two other players can each take control one of 3-5 (Depends on if you have Chaos Rising and Retribution) different "heroes" and fight off waves of AI controlled units.

The previous game had some of that too, but definitely a lot of economy and base building too. None of that here though, this is purely a combat game.\n\nYour heroes level up as they purge the xenos (that's Space Marine for killing just about everything) and each level up grants them a passive stat boost, 2 skill points and access to better gear (which drops randomly from enemies you kill, almost like an ARPG, but fortunately not quite as frequently).\nThese skill points (and your choice of weapon type and accessories) are your primary means of customization, and you can spend them on 4 attributes. Health, Ranged, Melee and Energy. The first 3 are self-explanatory, and Energy just gives you more "mana" to use your abilities in battle. What elevates this system to something far more strategic though, is that specific levels in an attribute can give very specific effects. For example, putting 3 points in Energy could unlock an additional accessory slot or allow your units to equip plasma rifles.\nThere aren't enough skill points to get everything though, as the maximum level is 20 (for your units anyway, I've seen enemy AI with level 27 units... I hate it when games do that). This means that you'll have to decide how to develop your units quite early on, and with no way to respec them and a total of 6 (steady) party members unlocked as the game progresses it is possible that you screw up your build and will have a harder time.\n\nIn general the game is pretty fair though, and as long as you don't split up your squad or rush into enemy fire unprepared (which will 'suppress' your squad, drastically lowering its movement speed) you should be okay.

The graphics when either zoomed in or out are amazing from the background and buildings to the units themshelves it is clear and prestine and not pixally at all. The fact you can see all the armour and weapon details on your squads makes me feel it is not just about stats. The story is great in how it blends all these different Warhammer races into one amazing story and the converstaions between your squad sergents allows you to get to know them and there personalities. Lastly is the stratagy without the ability to build buildings to get endless units you have to think more carefully about which squads to take on a mission by reading the bonus information on each mission.  Some missions present a hard challange at times which can be both frustrating and enjoyable at the same time. At one moment you could be crusing along plowing down units easily next you could be bogged down reviving your units or redoing a mission for the fourth time in a row. So beside haveing to think more on which squads to take and how hard some missions can be to me this is a good all round game.\n\n","April 9, 2015","true","43.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Aside from a few A.I issues the combat is fun and has some depth to it. Lots of gear, leveling and optional missions keeps the game from becoming too repetitive.

This is a tactical game, not really an RTS. The armies are small and valuable and micromanagement of their positions and power moves dominate gameplay. If that appeals to you, please check it out. While it is true that all of the species have incredibly similar army structures (scout unit, melee unit, support weapons, etc) they actually play very differently and feel very different during the game.\n\nSkirmish mode is best compared to a stripped down, very tactical company of heroes. The campaign is a four man army against a large volume of enemies (imagine small unit company of heroes played out over a fairly long campaign. Last stand is great but does get a bit old after a while. Played the living crap out of every mode and bought every expansion and can't reccomend it highly enough.","July 19, 2014","true","115.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Warhammer 40k: Dawn of War II is the sequel to Dawn of War where the epic tale of the Blood Ravens continues.\n\nControl & Gameplay:\nWarhammer 40k: Dawn of War ll renews the Dawn of War genre by adding some new core elements. The well known base building and creation of armies have been replaced by tight squad control, where the micromanagement of these squads will lead to a successful mission. You control each squad's loadout, specialization, abilities and generally everything about them. You will also need to take heed of the terrain, where to take cover, where to move and so on. This might seem as a giant leap away from the first Dawn of War series, and it certainly is. It takes some time to become accustomed with the new game mechanics, but once you get settled, the game is quite enjoyable. In campaign mode, each mission will allow you to choose 4 specialized squads who gain XP and items by completing each mission. There is a fixed number of squads to choose from. In multiplayer, the goal is to capture points and hold them, while building additional squads to supplement your commander in battle. The only building available on the field of battle is the headquarters, from which you can spawn more troops.\n\nThe controls are accurate and function without any trouble. In multiplayer, however, if a player is experiencing lag issues, it will affect the entire match, thus rendering control of your units more difficult or even impossible, if someone has a high latency. However, this issue is not prevalent, at least not from my experience.\n\nFun Factor:\nApart from the new style of gameplay, which can be a huge turn off for some players, Dawn of War ll is as original in its story as the previous games. The story remains rich and plays a significant part in the game, as you uncover dark secrets regarding the unknown past of the Blood Ravens.\nCurrently, the game is being converted to Steamworks from Games for Windows Live. Therefore, if anyone chooses to buy the game now, beware that large segments of multiplayer is currently unavailable for use.\n\nGraphics & Audio\nThe visual aspect of the game is a continuation from the previous style: still dark and gritty, but with added details.\nThe soundtrack is heavy and it enhances the coarse and gritty quality of the game. For the most part, it supplements the game subliminally. After a while, I did not even notice it due to the constant shooting and blowing up of mines, detonation charges and xeno matter flying around.\n\nReplayability:\nI have spent 100+ hours on this game already, so I would argue that the replayability is indeed high. Even more so with the two expansions: Chaos Rising and Retribution.\nIn the original Dawn of War 2, there is a campaign and multiplayer mode. Additionally, the campaign can be played both singleplayer and multiplayer through COOP, which I would highly recommend.\nFurthermore, another mode was introduced, namely "The Last Stand". Here, a group of 3 commandos are pitted against 20 waves of unrelenting xenos. Definitely worth hours of fun and frustration.\n\nConclusion:\nDespite the fact that Dawn of War ll has moved away from the original Dawn of War games in terms of mechanics, the game still offers exciting gameplay, a well-structed narrative and solid campaign. Where the older games focused on base building and overwhelming your opponent, the new games focus on managing a handful of specialist squads. Terrain, cover and movement patterns play a larger role in succeeding missions.\nThe game does not run optimally online yet, as the whole net client is being transferred from Games for Windows Live to Steamworks. Therefore, this is the only huge minus about the game, for the time being. This will soon change, and therefore, my rating for this game is positive - 7/10.","July 7, 2014","true","151.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

You play a new Force Commander who is put in charge of an operations and must "hold the area" until assistance arrives in the form of a great Astartes fleet. You have no lines and while that normally bugs me in this instance its well done as you listen to your squad leaders speak amongst themselves and then look to you for orders. Good gear customization and tactics really do come into play in this game vs the original where you could just throw the book at them. Boss fights can get hairy and somtimes are stupidly difficult but with proper planning and tactics are winnable.

My first exposure to this world was the original Dawn of War franchise, and I loved how they tweaked the traditional RTS style with a new squad based style.\n\nWith Dawn of War 2 they did it again; the game wasn't going to adhere to standardised conventions. While never fully either an RTS or RPG, it contained the best of these elements. Think party based RPG with loot drops!\n\nThe game allows you to appreaciate the Space Marine as it should be - a small squad of super human soldiers cutting its way through a multitude of enemies to achieve its objective. No hunkering behind defenses, no building a bigger army than necessary. You are dropped in the centre of the action and you have to literally carve your way through with bolter and chainsword.\n\nThe story is relatively straight forward, but you will be constantly drawn back to the high paced visceral action and adrenaline rushing music. Nothing can relieve stress as effectively as dropping your assault marines on top of a cluster of enemies and making them go splash.","September 25, 2014","true","223.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The voice acting in the game is great and the story moves at a  good pace and has nice twists to keep you intrested. The game is mainly a squad based shooter where in you command your squads across the map eliminating enemies and complete various goals. Aside from a few A.I issues the combat is fun and has some depth to it. Lots of gear, leveling and optional missions keeps the game from becoming too repetitive. Multiplayer shines with proper rts elements of base building. Whole game can also be played in coop, where squads are shared making it much more entertaining and challeging.\n\nDawn of war 2 is a great game and is definately worth a look.","July 17, 2014","true","14.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The Retribution is the same thing, but with many more campaigns where you can play any race/faction existing in the DoW universe.\nBoth of these games have also a co-op mode that is called The Last Stand, where you choose a unit from any race (in DoW II you need to buy the Chaos Expansion to play one race, and a DLC to play another unit in the DoW II: Retribution), team up with other 2 players and survive as many possible waves you can, using many skills to either control areas, destroy enemies, support allies, etc.\n\nAnd the last one, "Space Marine", is a fighting game in third person where you'll take part as a space marine in a war against the Orks and Eretics (obviously, you'll be outnumbered here too)\n\nAs i said, every game of the serie is great, but for a new RTS style i suggest you trying this out, and then move on the other games to get the emperor's blessing, like i did.\nFOR THY EMPEROR","July 15, 2015","true","25.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I never expected it to live up to the first. But I have never been to delightfully wrong. If you are looking for a copy past of the first title this isn't it. It's a completely new experience and all for the best. It's less RTS and more action RPG. You take control over a small kill team of Blood Raven Marines that as you progress can mix and match to adapt to various missions. The story was as solid as could be and the game play was fluid and beautiful. I spent countless hours on this one years back. And didn't hesitate to buy it again on Steam.

Simply put, they are by far the best video game adaptation of the Warhammer 40,000 universe to date.\n\nIn diverging from the now stale traditional RTS game model, and integrating some elements from the RPG genre, Relic have created a masterpiece of strategy gaming. Fast paced but refined, it is a far better game than it's launch year competitor, Starcraft 2, simply down to the fact the design of its gameplay is over a decade more advanced in terms of evolution and innovation. By improving on the the original Dawn of War formula by blending its best elements and mechanics with those from Company of Heroes, Dawn of War 2 delivers an experience unlike any other on offer.\n\nWith DoW2, Relic once again demonstrate their repect for Games Workshops most popular setting, creating a 40K game with the love and care of the most dedicated tabletop fan. The story is the typical cheesy sci-fi goodness we've come to expect of 40K. The visuals are still incredible, and stand up very well compared with even new releases. Also, like always with Relic, the sound is flawless, drawing you completely into the setting and story with ease.\n\nBy design, DoW2 is more like three games rolled into one. The Campaign mode (which can also be played co-operatively), a PvP Multiplayer mode and a Co-op Multiplayer mode known as "The Last Stand". The three components are similar in feel, but differ slightly in terms of gameplay, offering a unique experience for each game mode. All three modes are extremely fun in their own right, and combined have provided me with months worth of entertainment.\n\nTo sum up, Dawn of War 2 (plus expansions) are some of the very best strategy games ever made, and if they even slightly peak your curiosity, you should buy them. Now. You won't regret it.\n\nFOR THE EMPEROR!","December 23, 2013","true","159.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

First of all, I have no ties to the Warhammer 40K universe. I've never read the books, I don't have any of the figurines, and I've never played any of the other games. The only prior knowledge I had about the lore was space orcs, with guns. I was never interested in this game. My brother gave me a 75% off coupon and I bought it, installed it, and played it. I can safely say it is  one of my favorite game of all time.\n\nAn outline of the game. Dawn of War II is a Real Time Strategy based in the Warhammer 40K. It is a cover based game where you always have 4 squads on the field (you get the ability to change out squads for other squads with different abilities). This game also has a little bit of an RPG element thrown into it. You can customize the armor, weapons, and accessories, as well as leveling up your squad with XP points.\n\nThe game is centered in the subsector of Aurelia, where there are three planets that you orbit between. There are missions on the three planets. The missions usually consist of go here kill this or destroy this. The missions do kind of get a little bit repetitive but as to where it's a problem *cough PAYDAY2 cough*.\n\nThere is also a multiplayer feature. You can play cooperatively or competitively. In co-op you can either do the campaign, where two people control two squads. The other game mode is skirmish, where you can either fight with or against your friends, as different races.\n\nNow on to the pros and cons of the game:\n\nPros:\nSimple but nice mechanics\nRPG elements\nNice story for an RTS\nSlicing through low level enemy’s with a high level plasma canon.\n\nCons:\nRepetitive missions\nRepetitive missions\nTwo of my squads got stuck on an invisible wall once\n\nDespite its faults, few faults that is, Dawn of War is an excellent game. I would recommend this game to newbies of 40K, like me, and veterans.\n9/10","August 29, 2015","true","18.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kingsigy/recommended/15620/","kingsigy","KingSigy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kingsigy/","526 products in account","Relic Entertainment made some incredible RTS games with the Warhammer 40,000 license. In an era after the release of Warcraft III, many were wondering what else was left to do with the genre. It seemed honed to perfection by Blizzard's creation and no follow-up to Starcraft was even announced.\n\nWhile the initial release was mainly an introduction to the universe for more casual fans, the expansions molded the overall experience into a galaxy spanning, epic tale of betrayal, revenge, violence and Orcs. It definitely captured a few years of my life, to be sure.\n\nWhile the final expansion to the first game (Soulstorm) was a bit of a letdown, Relic's then brand new Company of Heroes showed a different side of an RTS. It was more action oriented, with less emphasis on tactical planning and more on reactionary combat. It felt like an actual war, instead of how RTS games had played out in the past.\n\nWith Dawn of War II, Relic has adapted a similar style to the campaign that they used in Company of Heroes. You no longer focus on building a base, queueing up units and acquiring upgrades. The moment to moment gameplay is about utilizing the abilities of your squad and conquering your foes with minimal damage.\n\nIt makes for situations that feel overwhelming and create a real sense of accomplishment over meager skirmishes. Ramping up the difficulty leads to even crazier encounters, but the game never feels like it's totally out of your control. The RPG-lite system used to level up your units is one way to mitigate any potential difficulty.\n\nAnother comes from the loadouts you can equip your commander with. Things like grenades, shields, medkits, artillery strikes and other weapons give you a lot of control over how you tackle each level. That the campaign missions never start feeling boring is also a plus, since it's fun to mix and match tactics while constantly having to adapt to new problems.\n\nThe only real downside is that the story is particularly drab. I know the names of my units since they love to talk about themselves, but I couldn't tell you the overarching threat or what is even really going on. The ending is pretty sweet (even with the fake out), but there isn't a real cathartic payoff for the amount of effort you put in.\n\nI'd love to comment about the multiplayer (since this game is now free of Games for Windows Live), but I guess everyone has moved on to the second expansion, Retribution. I did find a few matches and Last Stand mode, in particular, is great, but there just isn't that big of a community on the original non-Steam games.\n\nThat aside, the netplay does function and is nearly lag-free, so playing co-op with a friend is a completely viable option. That the prospect doesn't fill me with dread also shows how engaging the gameplay in Dawn of War II really is.\n\n8.5/10","March 24","true","13.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/senorsantiago/recommended/15620/","senorsantiago","(PoA) ¿Señor Santiágo?!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/senorsantiago/","666 products in account",""None can stop the crusade of the righteous."-Captain Davian Thule, Blood Ravens Commander, Sub-sector Aurelia\n\nI recently replayed Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War II from Relic Entertainment & THQ/SEGA.  I can gladly report that it still has the magic it did back in 2009.  Remarkably to this day it remains the most quintessential Warhammer experience to be found in videogaming, arguably tied with the action title, Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine.  I doubt DoW2 will be knocked from that top spot by either Warhammer: End Times - Vermintide or the upcoming Total War entry to the IP.  Not sure whether or not to get my hopes up for Eternal Crusade.\n\nNote: This review is strictly for the original game; I've played the expansions but don't own them on Steam, and I'll make no comment on those expansions at the time of this writing except to say they're excellent; Chaos Rising adds diversity and great content.  I also did not engage the alternate game modes or multiplayer, only the single player campaign, so I make no comment on those here either.\n\nOf the four difficulty settings (Recruit, Sergeant, Captain & Primarch) I did a full playthrough on normal (Sergeant).  At this level, you can pretty much roll through the entire game without worrying overmuch about careful use of abilities or cover.  Not ideal for the RTS veteran but preferable to quickly absorb the campaign story.\n\nIn this mission based campaign you're allowed one or more deployments per day.  Each mission is rated based on your performance in three categories (offense, survival & speed).  Ratings are also affected by certain side objectives.  Overall rating is presented to the player on campaign completion.\n\nCore gameplay is in squad dynamics.  There are: Force Commander, Tactical Marine, Devastator Marine, Assault Marine, Scout & Dreadnought.  I found the gameplay to have a balance of accessibility & depth.  Choosing the right squad composition & gear is half the battle in any mission; the other half requires timely use of cover & abilities.\n\nThere's plenty of RPG progression mixed in, including gear, experience, attributes, traits and skills.  Gear is looted in mission or given as a reward; each squad can equip weapons, armor, accessories & consumables that should be tailored to the needs of each mission.  You'll gain 2 points per level to put into attributes (Stamina, Ranged, Melee, Energy) & earn strategy altering traits.\n\nYour 1st mission on any given day shouldn't be a Defense - those are more difficult to acquire high ratings in for some reason.  It's your performance in that 1st mission that determines how many extra deployments (none, one or two) you receive.  As such, make the 1st one strong to nab extra deployments.\n\nOn that note, prioritize capturing Foundries over Comm Arrays or Imperial Shrines when possible, since of those three resources it's the Foundry that gives bonus to mission rating for the purpose of earning extra deployment.  Your ability to complete one or two extra missions per day is critical to keeping ahead of the enemy, especially late campaign.  As for the other two resources, I found the shrine bonus (a limited use per mission invulnerability shield) to be slightly more useful than the Comm Array (a targeted orbital strike, also limited use per mission).\n\nWhile Force Commander items like the drop pod beacon & other big area of effect attacks are fun & have a lot of flair, they should be used cautiously; they can & will hit squads too close to the target zone, potentially killing them outright (hurting your Survival score for that mission).\n\nSquads that frequently sit on the sideline can & will fall behind your regular squads in level a bit, even with the "Librarium" feature which lets the player discard spare items in exchange for experience.  Being lower in level, they'll also inevitably be comparatively undergeared, so rotate them a bit.\n\nMy biggest issue with the game is no option for restarting a mission, no quicksave or quickload, no manual saving at all except between missions.  Once you load into that mission, you must complete it for better or worse; if you close the game, a day will have passed in your campaign automatically.  It's a bother if you mess up badly, since you have to live with the poor mission rating afterwards.  Of course plenty of players and developers embrace this tough stance towards saving/loading, as it raises the stakes!  Thankfully maps aren't so big as to draw out mission length too much.\n\nStory is very straightforward Warhammer fare, with a fun cast of squad leaders to walk you through it.  Visuals, audio & production value leave little to be said, although it does look a bit better than the average game from the year 2009.  There were no technical issues or bugs that I encountered.\n\nIt's frustrating that the continuation of the Dawn of War series has been complicated by changing ownership & THQ's fate.  I'll believe there's a third installment in the works only when I can click the preorder button on Steam's store page!  WH40K:DoW2 is showing its age visually but is otherwise an admirably well crafted game that holds up to modern standards well enough; I highly recommend it for the excellent science fiction and solid RTS strategy - and obviously it's a must play for any Warhammer fan.","October 31, 2015","true","18.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

First of all, I have no ties to the Warhammer 40K universe. I've never read the books, I don't have any of the figurines, and I've never played any of the other games. The only prior knowledge I had about the lore was space orcs, with guns. I was never interested in this game. My brother gave me a 75% off coupon and I bought it, installed it, and played it. I can safely say it is  one of my favorite game of all time.\n\nAn outline of the game. Dawn of War II is a Real Time Strategy based in the Warhammer 40K. It is a cover based game where you always have 4 squads on the field (you get the ability to change out squads for other squads with different abilities). This game also has a little bit of an RPG element thrown into it. You can customize the armor, weapons, and accessories, as well as leveling up your squad with XP points.\n\nThe game is centered in the subsector of Aurelia, where there are three planets that you orbit between. There are missions on the three planets. The missions usually consist of go here kill this or destroy this. The missions do kind of get a little bit repetitive but as to where it's a problem *cough PAYDAY2 cough*.\n\nThere is also a multiplayer feature. You can play cooperatively or competitively. In co-op you can either do the campaign, where two people control two squads. The other game mode is skirmish, where you can either fight with or against your friends, as different races.\n\nNow on to the pros and cons of the game:\n\nPros:\nSimple but nice mechanics\nRPG elements\nNice story for an RTS\nSlicing through low level enemy’s with a high level plasma canon.\n\nCons:\nRepetitive missions\nRepetitive missions\nTwo of my squads got stuck on an invisible wall once\n\nDespite its faults, few faults that is, Dawn of War is an excellent game.

It's true, it is completely different, through that's no reason for hate or prejudgement. Dawn of War II on it's own is a fantastic game, I risk to say maybe ageless to be picked up again years after for it's campign, and if you don't expect an FPS game to be TPS, you'll realize if everything else other than the perspective is marvelously done, you have a great game.\n\nThe same applies to Dawn of War II. It has left behind base building completely, the entire campign is leading a relatively small elite force, in a gameplay setting that is equal to classic RTS games, plus you have the cover system from Company of Heroes, and a lot RPG elements. This, as is, works freaking great. You expect it be a base building resource gathering army building game, well it's not, and that's no reason to hate it (reacting to the negative reviews).\n\nThe gameplay itself is fluid, smart. Tactics, strategies, adapting to new situations and changing (destroyable) enviroment\nis vital to success, and can be greatly different from playthrough to playthrough, from player to player, depending on the playstyle, RPG build (skill tree and equipment that drasticly change your squad) you choose.\n\nThe graphics are fantastic up to this day, even if the game can be considered "somewhat aged" in 2016, if someone would ask me to pick a classic RTS (classic as in not 10000000000 units at once Total War, more like Command and Conquer used to be)  with the best looks, I'd pick Dawn of War 2 today, even over Company of Heroes 2 that came after it from the same company. The music is great and totally hooks you in, the voice distorsions, the deep bass when an assault rifle with bullets sized like my leg fire, the often seemingly endless swarm of orks and tyranids really support the feeling of a brutal war where 3m tall living warmachine of men punch space orks and locusts in the face with an armored fist that hits like a train. The FEELING is really there, despite the low number of units under our control that are mostly observed from a bird's perspective, and that is proof of professional work. Add that to the excellent gameplay, and you have a great game. The campign is lengthy, and generates endless sidemissions for global terrirorial control additionally to the main missions. The story is really nothing to be bothered with, it does it's job, it's there, but it is the gameplay you'll want to have Dawn of War II for.\n\nMultiplayer. Well... this is much like the singleplayer (for which you should buy this game), and not at all. Hardly traditional, just like the singleplayer - if you usually avoid RTS multiplayer because you get crushed by people with high APM (action-per-minute, how fast they play), Dawn of War II is for you. You don't have to worry about managing home, high APM, it's all about tactics, but also territorial control with the capture points giving resources and different capture points you must hold to win. This mechanism isn't present in singleplayer at all, and you build normal units instead of heroes with a squad. Microing your units may be even more important than in StarCraft 2, but without the pressure of multitasking knowing that if you micro a lot and let your base idle, you lost the next fight. Non of that. Be a good strategist, you'll be good here - though, multiplayer is dead in this version, grab the Retribution standalone expansion for this! Check out my review on the Last Stand, which is a coop hero based survival multiplayer mode, but could be (and even is sold as now) a separate game, but it is included here aswell if you are curious.\n\nTL,DR\n\nWHAT TO BUY DAWN OF WAR 2 FOR?\nIf you want a lenghty campign and you are not bothered by it being repetitive, but rather see the opportunity to battle harden yourself and your heroic squads with various tactics in a great RTS enviroment, supported with RPG elements that change your squad from mission to mission on your choice, to try new compositions. Much like Devil May Cry games, you  replay it for being better at fights, and not look at them as "another same target". It's exciting, challanging, and evolving on the fly.\n\nWHAT NOT TO BUY DAWN OF WAR 2 FOR?\nIf you are looking for the classic RTS gameplay with base building, army building, resource harvesting. These days the best choice you have for that is StarCraft II, and maybe Grey Goo though I have not played the latter yet. If you like it as is, but primary reason of purchase would be multiplayer, buy W40K:DOW2: Retribution instead. While the campign is definitly subpar compared to Dawn of War II + Chaos Rising, the multiplayer is entirely living there.","March 13","true","149.4"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Of course, this was a decade ago and my coordination has gotten better. The primary reasons, though, that I tried Dawn of War 2 out was because there was no base building. This made the game very tactical and my units more valuable. I couldn't just produce more meat for the grinder without risking my important units.\n\nOh and the story is pretty okay. Characters tend to be macho, but since I was using these characters over and over during battle, I've gotten attached to some. Even though your character, the Force Commander, never speaks, you feel like your doing something because the units ALWAYS compliment your leadership rather than their badass abilities.\n\nIt's also a Wahmmer 40k game. THere's a lot of lore and what not, which makes me wonder why there hasn't been an RPG made yet.\n\nSo... droning on....... It's a good game? 9/10.","August 9, 2014","true","13.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you want to just play skirmish with friends, I can't compare it to any other dawn of war 1 games, but soulstorm is much better than this. If you want a campaign that is quite frankly stupid (although still fun), and the last stand game mode, where you just play an HQ, like a sh*t moba, with 2 allies against hordes of enemies, then get this. I have played one skirmish with friends as of writing this. There are no builder units, and a lot of the squads I built started with max capacity. There were only 5 different armies to choose from, although you could change the colour scheme with no other effects I can find, although it was quite fun. Not having any of the other DLC, I can't really judge this game in its entirity, but I can't see it improving it to be better than soulstorm in skirmish (do buy the steam version, as the disk version's online multiplayer isn't nice to use). If you read the entirity of this, I hope you can appreciate how much damage sleep deprivation causes.","September 29, 2015","true","7.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/recommended/15620/","widgetguy","widgetguy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/","975 products in account","TLDR – Dawn of War 2 is real time strategy game that borrows squad type combat from Company of Heroes (same game developer). Despite the RPG elements and seemingly overwhelming odds in each level, the game really isn’t that difficult if you take your time, so don’t let that turn you off. If you like epic sci-fi stories and real time strategy, you should enjoy DOW 2.\n\nIn this game, you play a “force commander” in the Blood Ravens, a chapter of the badass Imperial Space Marines. This isn’t just a story line thing, your commander unit is deployed in every level and you run him around shooting and chopping bad guys like a hero unit in Warcraft 3. If you’ve played Warhammer games before you should recognize most of your enemies this time around. The Orks are brutish thugs (as you would expect from orcs) and the Eldar are high tech psychic aliens (kind of like Protoss in Starcraft). The Space Marines as usual have made it their mission to wipe out all aliens in the galaxy, meaning you fight everyone everywhere. This time around you face a new threat, the Tyranid Hive Swarm (much like the Zerg in Starcraft) which is invading your sector of space, killing humans, Orks, and Eldar alike.\n\nFirst of all, if you’re used to real time strategy games like Starcraft, Warcraft, or Command & Conquer, there are a few key differences you should know right off the bat:\n•	This game is more “tactical” than strategy, meaning you do not build anything (buildings/units). You start each mission with all the troops you’re going to get (except missions where they introduce your new squads).\n•	You can only deploy 4 squads per mission (total of 6 available), and they are all “heroes” meaning they level up and can be equipped with weapons/armor/accessories. They also all have special abilities and “mana” to cast spells. You’re going to be doing a bunch of micromanagement throughout the game.\n•	All of your units have both melee and ranged attacks, and you can toggle which one to use. This isn’t a feature in many real time strategy games and you can exploit it in some cases (suppress the enemy with heavy ranged attacks and then charge in with melee to wipe them out).\n•	Between missions, you often get to choose where you will deploy next. Even the story missions can sometimes be played in your choice of order. This became a problem for me because the order I played the missions unlocked a certain unit almost at the end of the game, and he turned out to be my favorite.\n•	Note that you will be playing on the same 12 or so maps throughout the campaign, but starting at different points on the map. This is because all of your battles are fought in the same sub sector of space, and you’re competing with the aliens to hold ground. Also keep in mind that most maps have special buildings that you can capture, providing bonuses to your overall war effort. Start early and capture as many as you can because holding these buildings offers special “defense missions” where you try to survive waves of alien attacks (more missions means more exp and item drops).\n•	Another thing to note is that you can’t save the game manually during missions, it autosaves between missions. If you quit a mission, you get a loss on your record.\n\nPros:\n+Excellent storytelling and a variety of aliens to pound on. If you’re a fan of Warhammer, don’t miss out.\n+Simplified gameplay, just your 4 squads vs large hordes of enemies and occasional bosses. Don’t just charge in or you’ll be wiped out.\n+The game has co-op campaign gameplay available. You and your friend can play through the single player campaign, each controlling 2 squads (instead of you controlling all 4). This can be helpful if you’re bad at micromanagement, like me.\n\nCons:\n-Like the Company of Heroes games, there seems to be a lot of luck involved in the gameplay, specifically in gun accuracy. Normally you wouldn’t expect real time strategy games to have units missing their shots so much. It’s not really a bad thing, but it can take some getting used to. Also, the ability to charge in with melee units or throw grenades really negates the “cover” system.\n-A minor gripe, but it seems like a bunch of the game’s Steam achievements are for playing ranked multiplayer matches and for the Chaos Rising DLC.\n\nOverall, the game is fun and will last you quite a while (took about 14 hours to beat). Each individual mission is short (you get bonus exp for finishing faster), but the single player campaign is lengthy and you have many variables to choose from when it comes to skilling and equipping your squads. You can’t just mass produce units and crush the enemy like other real time strategy games, you actually have to guide them with some semblance of skill.  Also, if you play the multiplayer, be warned that gameplay is drastically different from the single player campaign. You have to build units and tech up like in standard real time strategy games.\n","August 31, 2015","true","24.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And it's still a great one to have in mind. Probably the best thing is the campaign mode, as well as the coop mode. Mostly, thanks to Games for Windows' horrible matchmaking system.\n\nThis game's graphics are quite beautiful, for its time. And very few games of that time had dynamic environments, in which you can virtually destroy everything. That was amazing, but developers did not only create a modifiable, pretty environment, but they as well made a great job creating a game with so many strategical possibilities, even before the mission has started. You can choose which squads deploy, with which skills do they do it, which loadout are they going to have... And then during game, the cover system is absolutely delightful to use. There is absolutely no way you can play and win this just based on luck. You totally need to think carefully every movemente from the Normal difficulty campaign, let alone harder ones.\n\nBut then, when you have gone tired of playing this game alone (which, believe me, will take a long time), you are going to want to play the multiplayer one. And that's not going to be so pleasant. When this game wasn't so old, it was hard to find a 3v3 multiplayer game. Nowadays it's impossible. The only mode that works more or less as it should is the coop one, and, even though it's fine, long queues and GOW matchmaking system will probably make you stop playing multiplayer soon. Along with some toxic players, as always.\n\nIn spite of all that, this game is one of the best RTS ones you are ever going to find. It gets you plotting plans from the first 3 minutes, guaranteed.","June 6, 2014","true","196.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The resource gathering is all but gone and there are no structures to build, production or defensive. Instead you get to control small squads of soldiers with a variety of abilities in a micro battle against either the single-player hordes or an equally micro intensive multi-player opponent.\n\nDawn of War 2 stands a bit a part from other RTS's by having the single-player campaign and the multi-player battles play rather differently. In single-player you control individual soldiers, heroes if you will, through various maps filled with entrenched enemies and a boss at the end in a very RPG-like fashion. Your heroes gain experience, unlock new abilities and collect wargear to improve themselves along the way.\n\nThe story is great and captures the WH40K feel quite nicely and the story missions are mostly of a fairly high quality, unfortunately all the mission in between the story ones are just repeats of the same maps, the same enemies and the same bosses and it gets tiresome rather quickly. The highest difficulty actually succeeds in making the game a challenge although that dissipates somewhat once you start to max out gear and levels around midway through the campaign.\n\nIn the multi-player you take control of squads instead but the same RPG elements persist even if they are just included within the map and their effects doesn't persist beyond that. This produces some heavily micromanagement intensive battles which will be interesting for some, dreadful for others. I found myself missing the classic strategy base building quite often and as such the multi-player never really grew on me.\n\nThe developers also added in a second style of multi-player that quickly found itself far more popular than the standard match-ups called "Last Stand". In this mode you play together with up to three friends each controlling a persistent hero character that earns experience and unlocks equipment after each battle.\n\nLast Stand plays out in an area, you and your 3 companions must survive increasingly tougher waves of enemies being thrown at you while earning score the better you play. That score is at the end of the round turned into experience for your characters.\n\nWhile Last Stand is essentially a form of action RPG it feels more truer to the style THQ seems to have been aiming for in Dawn of War 2 and as such playing it comes much more naturally to those that do the single-player campaign first. I had a lot of fun in although the matchmaking system and the prevalent lag issues did annoy me quite a bit.\n\nGraphically Dawn of War is a pretty enough looking game and the WH40K art-style works wonders as always. The sounds are as satisfying as ever and the voice-acting is sufficiently competent to keep you in the mood.\n\nIt is also worth noting that this is a Games For Windows Live game with all the problems that goes along with it. Don't even bother if you have an unreliable internet connection.\n\nAll in all Dawn of War 2 was a game I enjoyed despite it's flaws, the single-player was fun albeit a bit grindy at times. The regular multi-player was quite dull but the Last Stand mode made up for it, when it worked. It's a good game and a good buy, if you can stand owning a game with GFWL.","November 16, 2012","true","310.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The single player campaign allows for some solid action and adventuring against a new host of enemies while the new levelling and item equip system establishes some continuity and a more goal-oriented approach than the traditional "Build up and tear down" RTS campaign can offer.\n\nRich voice acting and solid graphics couple with the telltale chaotic pumping of bolters, plasma guns and chain swords to provide a great visceral experience with great ambiance and enough versatility to allow you to customize your style of play / strategize from mission to mission using different units to suit different approaches.\n\nBest of all, a "Drop in, Drop out" mission by mission co-op feature to the campaign makes gaming with friends easy and effective. A great buy if you can get Chaos Rising and Retribution in an package for $10 - $20.","December 9, 2013","true","48.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

Что бы дать достойный отпор живому игроку, приходилось детально изучать понравившуюся расу, использовать сильные её качества и уметь прикрывать недостатки. В Dawn of War II от стратегии мало что осталось(тупой захват стратегических точек + убить босса), развернуться негде, да и выбор, за кого играть, теперь стал не таким уж большим, Зато графон стал очень приятен глазу, смерти - еще более жестокими(за что мы все и любим эту серию), взрывы техники тоже выглядят очень здорово. Кампания хоть и интересная, но не дотягивает до уровня первых Вархамеров.

I liked the way building used to fly from the sky crashing down to the ground ready to be build. After building a base you would create an army to fight off another army that could be from a different kind of race which also got its own abilities etc.\n\nBut the point is, I hoped that Dawn of War II would be the same good game as its predecessor. but its none of the sort.\n\nDawn of War® II gives you an small squad putting you down a path which is making the game more story based and thus giving you less freedom in your decision making. The purpose of this was to make you feel more connected whit the protagonists.\n\nThan i thought "Why would Relic fix something that isn’t broken?". Dawn of War was a good game and a true RTS. Dawn of War II is good looking but completely different from what it should have been. The concept... completely destroyed.

Where should I start? This game focuses on its singleplayer campaign rather than the (rather unattended) multiplayer, but I'm okay with that. The characters are well written (I'm pretty sure we're supposed to hate Avitus, but I hate Cyrus), the story is brilliant, and the gameplay is immensely entertaining. Everything you do has a "feel" to it, as if it matters. Every mission felt like you actually accomplished something; every boss killed giving you a sense of triumph and honour.\nThe final mission was lackluster, however. The final boss in said mission was easier to kill than the first boss. In fact, the whole end was extremely rushed, expecting you to waste time repeating the exact same "defend the array" missions for hours before executing the final mission. Besides that, I would give this game a solid 8.5/10. I would certainly recommend this.","June 18, 2015","true","23.1"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","0"

If you don't know what that is you better look it up before you think about buying something with Warhammer attached to it,  they are not for everyone .\nIt is also a Games for Windows Live Game as well as a Steam game, so if you want a game for its' multiplayer look somewhere else. Now... I'm going to break things down into ratings.\n\nGameplay 9/10\nVery strategic strategy game, tactics will get you a lot more than sheer numbers or unit strength.\n\nSingle-Player Campaign 10/10\nThe Dawn of War II campaign is a mix between Horde Survival, plot and a RTS. And I'll be damned if it doesn't do it well. Dawn of War II is quite different from its predecessors. No longer is their extensive Base Building. Infact, in a Campaign mission you have NO BASE. You may have a location, a base you need to defend for a mission but it isn't yours. You can't build stuff from it. There are strategic locations scattered around the mission maps though. Your 'army' is divided into 4 squads. Throughout the campaign you will end up acquiring more than 4 squads but you can only deploy 4 squads to a mission. Each squad is unique, they have their own strategies and skills. The game has introduced a Experience system. This system is most noticeable in the Campaign. As you kill and kill, as well as complete missions your Squads will gain levels individually (to a maximum of level 20). With each level your squads gain two points to put in a talent tree of your choice. Most squads have certain trees that they can put enormous amounts of points and skill into, while others they can only put a few in because of previously stated differences in each Squads specialization. Also, you may chose the 'wargear' for each of your squads. Some of these wargear provide statistic bonuses and similar to the squad that has that item equiped. Others are weapons that will allow the squad to better fulfill a certain task. At the end of the day though, you can have considerable flexibility with you squads. Invest you points in the right talent tree and a Squad that is intended to fulfill 1 role a certain way can fulfill a different role in a different way. Customization is one of the primary elements that has been introduced in force in Dawn of War II compared to its' predecessors. An added bonus is that the Campaign is two player, so you can play through the Campaign with a friend (who has the game obviously). From experience, doing the Campaign in co-op is loads of fun.\n\nMultiplayer 0/10\nThe Games for Windows Live was a huge hassal, and it was not a hard decision for almost the entire active Dawn of War II playerbase to switch over to Dawn of War II : Retribution. Retribution's multiplayer is through Steam, not Games for Windows Live (thank god).\n\nGraphics 8/10\nThere are games just as old with better graphics, but that being said... the graphics are certainly not an eyesore.\n\nAudio 9/10\nOutstanding voicework all around. Very realistic sounds to be heard on the battlefield. Be it the sound of the last spent shell falling onto the ground or one of you squads talking to each other on the field. Music is good.\n\nAll in all, great game but I would only recommend it for Warhammer 40k fans, particularly ones who have somebody to the play the campaign in Co-Op with.","March 26, 2014","true","95.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

It plays much differently from the first Dawn of War game, which is both a positive and a large negative.  When I first played the game, I was turned off by the fact that it was not like the first game at all, where you could have massive armies facing each other, upgrade your forces, and just summon a slew of Dreadnoughts if things weren't working with your 'subtle' approach.  However, once I examined the game on its own merits, I found that I enjoyed it very much.  You have to be careful with your units and determine what their strengths are (and what you want to be their strengths).\n\nI recommend playing it, at some point, on the hardest difficulty (Primarch).  The loot is better and the strategy aspect of the game becomes much more pronounced than it does on the lower difficulties (where a suicidal assault works because you're awesome).","December 12, 2013","true","110.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

In multiplayer you now have one Building from which everything is produced which you can level up through technologies advances\nNew race - Tyranids (Space dinosaurs)\n-races available - Space Marines (super soldiers in space), Orks (they are Orks in space), Eldar (Elves in space) [chaos rising] Chaos Space Marines (Evil Super soldiers in space)\n\nCampagin - quick overview\nThe campaign (in which you can only play space marines) is now a squadbased/rpg esque series of missions with different characters that you can level up/give different gear to and, in chaos rising, you can corrupt them, turning them to the ruinous powers. The campaign is fun. Missions are often 10-20 minute affairs with varying objectives. The units that you control are powerful and you will smile as 10 Space marines chew through a good 5 tyranids. The campaign is Co-op as well which is fun to play with a friend. Max level for you characters is 20 and chaos rising pushes it up to 30 and adds a couple characters.\n\nMultiplayer - quick overview\nIn multiplayer, mostly you will be playing matchmaking (though im not sure how much of a community there is so you might be searching for quite a while but if you get it with friends it is still fun) with the sole objective being point control. Resources are gained through capturing requisition points much like in the original DoW. Power is now generated by holding power points and building power generators on it. The four races are all unique and fun each having their own strategies. You can level up all the different races with cosmetic details as you gain experience for games.\n\nLast stand - quick overview\nLast stand is where you pick one character, which you can level up to level 20, from one of the 4(5) races (you have access to all of them no DLC unlike in retibution). Then you and 2 other people have to withstand 20 waves of enemies. A simple wave survival game mode but very fun when you get to higher waves and you have to fight 50 space marines with armour shredding plasma guns.\n\nAn exceptionally fun game that i have spent far too long playing. The campaign is fun and quite long. The multiplayer is tactical and quick. Games generally don't take hours and combat can be quite intense. Last stand is a wave survival mode where you can laugh manically as you call in an orbital bombardment or fire massive balls of flame at hordes of poor gaunts.","May 25, 2014","true","220.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The missions are /mostly/ banal, "kill or destroy objective X and survive" types that almost feel like MMO quests, yet the character upgrade system and decent story line compel long game sessions. Multiplayer is solid, if not a one-for-one copy of the Company of Heroes, excepting the fun yet underpopulated "Last Stand" co-op survival mode. Be weary of the "expansions", except for multiplayer. If you want multiplayer only, skip this and straight for Retribution, which features (almost) ALL units while forging the asinine Games for Windows Live side-program that is built in to DoWII and Chaos Rising.\n\nI should also add that the gameplay style is a MASSIVE departure from the earlyer DoW games, which were traditional RTS games. DoWII is much more of an RPG game than RTS, and has more in common with KOTR and Baldur's Gate than DoW1 or Company of Heroes. If you want an RTS experience, look elsewhere (except multiplayer, which as I said earlier, DoW is just a Warhammer 40k version of Company of Heroes - great but not groundbreaking). If you want a decent, perhaps solid RPG experience with acceptable RTS elements, this is a great choice.","October 16, 2011","true","87.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I wasn't quite sure what to expect when I picked up DOW II, but I must say I was pleasantly surprised.  Commanding smaller groups and sheparding them through missions allows me to focus on best utilizing special abilities and keeping my men alive.  My only complaint pertains to the difficulty scale, once you get past the entry level difficulty the boss fights ramp up significantly.  This may just be a personal problem though and more experienced RTS players may find the additional challange enjoyable.","December 22, 2013","true","36.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Unlike the first dawn of war games it isn't a true base building RTS, base building only partially comes into the game in the retribution expansion.  This is honestly one of my favorite games and along with the chaos rising expansion, the best squad based game i have come across. Although this is largely due to the awesome setting of the 40k setting.\n\nBe very careful when buying this game, it originally came with Games For Windows Live (GFWL) and doesn't work without it. The same goes for Chaos Rising unfortunately. As GFWL is now dead the game does not work (As of 1st of march 2014) and hasn't for several months.\nRetribution does work but I found it to be the least interesting of the three games, the campaign involves allot of spamming units and practically no recourse management. It came across to me as some RTS squad hybrid and achieved neither. Not sure about multiplayer in it though could be good.\n","March 1, 2014","true","6.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The developers should have called this Warhammer 40k (insert something other than Dawn of War 2) but they chose not to.

It is the sequel to the Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War video game series.  Dawn of War II features a non-linear interplanetary campaign, as the Space Marines. The campaign can be played either as single-player or cooperatively with another player through an online connection.\n\nThe game's campaign departs from those of its predecessors in several key features. One of the most notable departures is that there are no base-building elements, unlike in previous Dawn of War titles. Instead, the player chooses the units to be used prior to beginning a mission, cannot build new units once the mission begins, and has only limited reinforcement options.\n\nHas several multiplayer modes of play.\n\nfor more info:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I8Jmh8Nqvw\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKPUhMrNdpo\n\nhttp://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-ii/pc-14243516\n\nhttp://www.gamespot.com/reviews/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-ii-review/1900-6205011/\n\nhttp://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-ii\n\nhttp://www.pcgamer.com/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-ii/\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warhammer_40,000:_Dawn_of_War_II\n","February 20","true","41.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","2","4","2","0"

And the boss is basically a Raid Boss from WoW, complete with rediculous life meter, dodgable attacks, etc...\n\nSo what ends up happening is that you take 10 minutes to get to a boss fight which itself, lasts a boring 10 minutes, as you run around dodge, revivie, heal, etc...\n\nThis game is basically a 2.5D single player MMO.\n\nThe only time this game gets any cool, is when you finally get Terminator armor at the end of the game, and you get to feel badass. Besides that, go play the original Dawn of War if you want a real RTS experience.","May 8","false","30.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

As for story line. i think all warhammer fans think the same way. kill it! it focuses on the space marines, then a latter expansion gives you a choice of race. which is cool but should have been released with the vanilla version. Nothing really pops about this game. after you do 5 missions and meet the eldar you have experienced almost everything the game has to offer, to the point where it feels to much like grinding in an RPG and less like tactical warfare. id give the game a 3/10 and a 4/10 for the latter expansion. i bet if they made a dawn of war 3 and remade the first one they would have a great game, but this... i9 wouldn't give it to anyone. even if they paid me to take it.

This is not a strict strategy game, its a MOBA+strategy, a hybrid. Its good only for 2v2 and 3v3 and that's what most players of this game play. Its well suited for Faction war meaning all 3 heroes of the same faction together in the same team fighting all the 3 heroes of another faction. Playing the game like that its real fun so for i recommend real life friends to get it as this is how i started this game. Dont get the game if you are to play it solo you wont have fun. It would be great if its campaign had 4 player cooperate instead of 2 so that's a big deal negative, if there is a patch  that makes coop campaign for 4 players that would be great. In general i only recommend to get this game if you have a real life premade team lets say or you plan to play it with online friends, its good for that. Its a minimized CoH 1 but its not Warhammer game. If yougonna play multiplayer DoW 2 Retribution then you MUST get Elite mod, if makes the game real good and balanced. The modding team even fixed bugs retail has. The single player sadly has no 4 player coop mode but 2 which is very bad. DoW 2 Retribution is poorly made mini CoH 1 and has nothing to do with Warhammer 40K. DoW 1 mods are WAY BETTER and are 40K SOLID. To a casual gamer i recommend this game, to someone who wants 40K no i dont.

The game is beautiful, I love how they allowed more factions than in the base game, music is nice and still has some 40k authentic this&that, but sadly it's not feeling like the glove is a good fit this time around.  Was enough of a disappointment I it led to not being able to recommend this game.\n\nI was obviously disappointed.  I will try and make this short and give a few examples, but that's it. Dawn of War was great even though it lacked full customized matches (POP, Unit limitations, in-game map maker, etc...).  I love Space Marine; love painting it, reading it and even played some Tabletop, but too many things missing that should be added or not changed from the original.  A few examples are: Unit grouping (Ctrl+# = unit made and should stay within intelligent proximity = This Technology came out many years ago and easily adjusted) and no more unique buildings ....sucks!  Their attempts to lean into a MOBA are more than obvious to disadvantage.  A moba style will kill this game for me and all I know, so hopefully they do not go that route...hopefully.  They will be hiding under the wings of many successful MOBAs.\n\nI am a diehard 40k fan/gamer and I really wanted to give this game a great review, but I just can't.  Biggest disappointment for me was simply no buildings, but we are all different and that one was mine...\n\nSirspoony rating: 5/10 ....more buildings and a couple other major changes = 8/10\n\nI will come back again and again to check up on this game and really hope a few more patches and things will feel right once again or maybe even better, but with their obvious direction I think maybe after their MOBA fails...ugh :)\n\n\nUPDATED REVIEW:\n\nAfter some dicussion and more exploration in suggested DLC and strategy talks, my review has changed slightly.  I can now recommend this game.  When playing in a team based environment the game can be tons of fun over TS, but without that and trying to PUG, it's still lacking; given how small the community is, among other reasons.  In the end though I granted the game a better rating, but deep down inside I really wanted to find a way to give a recommendation.\n\nNEW Sirspoony Rating:  6.25/10","September 27, 2015","true","15.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

So when I saw the discount on the 2nd one I did not hesitate to buy it, but now I am really disappointed. The small changes in UI and gameplay just took away the spirit of the game. The new campaign model and the upgrade tree feels like it is a cheap MMO. So if you expect it to be like the first one I do not recommend it but if you are new to the universe it is a good game to play and this is a fairly good price for it (2,7 euros in Turkey).","July 19, 2015","false","2.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I cant get enough of the campaign.. Even though i now have to reattain all the achievments again, i dont mind.. DoW2 had many, many missions, and loot.. While DoW2:Chaos Rising added the Librarian, and Choas..\n\nEvery other RTS has base building, like DoW1 did.. I loved DoW1, and all the expansions, but, i hate base building, and blobs of meaningless army blobs.. I prefer the way DoW2 handles yoru groups.. 1 Hero, and a teammate or two..Not having the beginning of every pvp match the exact same boring BS finding minerals, building bases, etc is one o fthe major posistives imo.. Theres no  other RTS that does this, and i pary they keep this formula for DoW3, if it ever comes.. I did NOT like DoW2 Inquisition, because the went back to the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ group layouts of no name soldiers.. Not to mention, it boasts having 6 different campaigns, (1 per race) when its merely 1 campaign, played the same, from a different perspective.. Its exactly the same, 6 times.. I played each race once.. It sucked.. I cannot count how many times ive played DoW2, and DoW2:CR... Amazing!\n\nThe graphics, for their time, were pretty good as well too.. And the added plus being, the horde mode, which when people actually playd it, was amazing.. Even added a Tau Commander, and Colonel for it.. Last Stand, thats what it was called..

This time instead of massive C&C like base invasions, now you are given a squad to attack with. This is more tactical and you can't just re-build people to make it less of a concern when your main character dies. Instead they fall incapacitated, but can be revived, though you have to get someone to get back their men for those in squads. I had a lot of fun with this and it felt closer to Warhammer 40K than the previous games and you could be tactical by taking up buildings or hiding behind cover for protection.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tyladhras/recommended/15620/","Tyladhras","Sovereign","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tyladhras/","233 products in account","A fun tactical-rpg-esque game with fairly good writing, some funny lines ("we don't talk about the Kaurava campaign" - Cyrus) and fairly robust gameplay although it is pretty much standard rts fare.  That said, perhaps cover mechanics weren't quite as polished as they could be as squads would frequently move up to cover and then move to the wrong side of it when the enemy attacks but then again, you're mostly playing as "SPHESS MERINES! *tm" in the single player campaign.  Cover is for the weak.\n\nAs much as I enjoyed the campaign, I don't think it's really got much replay-ability.  Many of the missions seemed to be shoe-horned in for filler - although most of them were tankfully quite short - and I don't really think I'm willing to spend the same amount of time again on something that just didn't have a huge amount of narrative substance.  That said, the narrative was perfectly enjoyable but just sometimes took a couple of unnecessary fetch-quests before it went anywhere.\n\nI think I'd rank this maybe a 6.5/10 for being a perfectly enjoyable game that sadly doesn't have much more to offer the second time around.  It's fun, but just isn't the sequal it should have been.","January 1, 2015","true","13.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Ironically enough, they were left out of the first Dawn of War game due to how the Tyrannids "Didn't require any of the resources in the game and would work off their own resource" but that sort of thing wasn't supported by the engine.\n\nGuess what the tyrannids use? Requisition and Power, EXACTLY like the past game. Relic... what in the sh.it were you thinking?\n\nIgnoring that utter failure, the game isn't even really in the same sub-genre of strategy and focuses more on unit control with a tactical edge in real time. There's few units in the game, arguably jsut as many as in the last game, though they all build from the HQ.\nThe game has no base building mechanics and you gain power and requisition form capturing points. You can upgrade power points and your HQ, but that's it, everything's mostly just unit upgrades via previously used wargear systems used in the last game.\n\nFactions other games had, which this game lacks are listed below.\n\nThe Necrons.\nSisters of Battle.\nDark Eldar.\nThe Tau.\nChaos (Gained via the Chaos Rising Expansion).\nImperial Guard (Gained via the Retribution Expansion).\n\nCompared to the last game, this game is a serious 4/10, it's a bit disappointing in comparison, not really even a sequel due to the game focus change shifting from base building and army building to just army building which qualifies it as more of a Spinoff than a Sequel.\n\nOn it's own, the game is easily a 7/10, it's pretty decent. The singleplayer is neat and enjoyable, it keeps you on your toes for sure, and the multiplayer is fun if you can find a game or enjoy playing with bots.\n\nThe "The Last Stand" mode, otherwise known as Dawn of War 2 Horde Mode is also cool and is only enjoyable if you find a game, otherwise, you can't play it if you can't find a game.\n\nI'd buy this game first and play it for a bit before getting the expansions.","February 15, 2014","true","16.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The sequel to the RTS Dawn of War has been turned into an arena combat game along the lines of a MOBA. There is no resource management, no bases to construct, and no squads which are the bedrock of the table-top game on which this series is based.\n\nAdmittedly, the single-player campaign has a pretty good story line, as far as game storylines go, and the art design of the Warhammer 40K universe is always great.\n\nBottom line, if you're looking for a real-time strategy base-building game, this is not that game.

However, very linear, and while it gives the illusion of choice and outcome, none of it makes a difference to the main storyline.  Unlike its predecessors, you can't lose campaign, and replayability is null since it's exactly the same each time.\n\nI didn't have the opportunity to try out other game modes as the multiplayer community is nonexistent at this point.\n\nAlso not a fan of being limited to the preset hero units.  Although they are customizable to a degree, it seriously weakens them if you don't stick to their intended playstyle, thus defeating the purpose of customization.  It's a neat idea, but it should have been implemented as an improvement on RTS unit creation rather than completely replacing it.\n\nFun game for the one shot, but I'm glad I got it on sale, not at all worth full price.\n\n34 hrs on record is because I left it open overnight -- probably got up to get something to drink and didn't come back.","October 13, 2015","false","34.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Here you go!\n\nPros: Dawn of war II is a game that involves you, a force commander of the Blood Ravens space marine chapter doing things for your Chapter (Avoiding spoilers) average space marine stuff right? Wrong. The campaign is a detailed, canon, and fun experience when played alone or with up to one friend and you can never be short of a good mission in the Campaign mode. Multiplayer is largely outdated by Dawn of war II Retributions multiplayer last stand and base multiplayer. Largely due to this you wont find hardly anyone online anymore on this game in particular.\n\nCons: Sometimes I think of myself as repeating the missions but with diffrent objectives and stuff, although the campaign is good it ends up getting repetitive after a few playthroughs this being my 4th. In co-op campaign game ending bugs on connection and during matches is common, not to mention unresponsiveness to commands.\n\nVerdict: This game is a rock on solid for anyone who loves the Warhammer 40k franchise or just likes to shoot xenos in the name of the Emperor. You will find hours of enjoyment and replayability always wondering what new wargear you can earn again and some diffrent choices mid campaign, and you would be happy with the Co-op system that allows for 1 buddy to share Cyrus, Avitus, You, Thaddeus, and Tarkus with eachother.\n\n\n","January 7","true","19.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It felt more like a knee-jerk reaction to competition to Star Craft II than expanding on the previous game. There wasn't much "strategy" involved and it 90% of the time ended up as a really long stalemate game until someone got relaxed enough that they made a mistake. The lack of units and unit abilities like in the previous game made it very boring as well. I liked some of the "newer" units, such as heroes, but it just didn't hit the void in my heart from the first game. Being that it's a couple years later that I'm reviewing this, I can imagine that this game is no longer supported, so I doubt there will be any additions or expansions outside of what is already released for this game.\n\nOh, and GAMES FOR WINDOWS LIVE. Why on EARTH would you include this in a game that you would sell on Steam? It's the most pain in the ♥♥♥ piece of ♥♥♥♥ and you have no other choice but to use it if you want to download updates for the game.","February 13","false","1.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The plot was good and i highly recommend it if you like a dynamic and strategic and tactical games. I think that this is definitley one of my most favourite game series out there so far and hopefully they release more of warhammer becuase i'm just waiting here till the new one comes out. I would rate it 8/10, the reason why it didn't get 10/10 becuase although the plot is good the story is a bit short and is quite easy to complete. Because it only took me a couple of hours to complete which really isn't that long becuase most games with storylines take quite sometime e.g. borderlands and others. This game truely is a wonder but still requires a bit more like most games, you can't just leave it there because there's always more too add.\n","July 20, 2015","true","24.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hyenatech/recommended/15620/","hyenatech","Yeenux","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hyenatech/","179 products in account","I wasn't very impressed with this sequel. It felt more like a knee-jerk reaction to competition to Star Craft II than expanding on the previous game. There wasn't much "strategy" involved and it 90% of the time ended up as a really long stalemate game until someone got relaxed enough that they made a mistake. The lack of units and unit abilities like in the previous game made it very boring as well. I liked some of the "newer" units, such as heroes, but it just didn't hit the void in my heart from the first game. Being that it's a couple years later that I'm reviewing this, I can imagine that this game is no longer supported, so I doubt there will be any additions or expansions outside of what is already released for this game.\n\nOh, and GAMES FOR WINDOWS LIVE. Why on EARTH would you include this in a game that you would sell on Steam? It's the most pain in the ♥♥♥ piece of ♥♥♥♥ and you have no other choice but to use it if you want to download updates for the game.","February 13","false","1.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I had to restart campain since I thought it was to easy even though i just randomly klicked. I now started in normal difficulty: seargant. Wich should be the one evryone should use. I felt like Nah i dont wona achieve al those achievements on such easy difficult :p . So that's why.\n\nNow for the game! -> read first if saving up for difficulty noncense\n\nRealy a fun and dynamic game even in 2016. It's more like a team based rpg fighting hordes of enemies taking cover using skills , items like nades.. etc . And u even have a nice squad that can bomb buildings while being invissible. The interactions are sweet. U can see the enemy trying to shoot u when u trow the detonation bomb to the building. Although you are invissible so they can't hit you ^^ I ended my gameplay for today againt a bossbattle. after boss missions you receive rankings on total enemies killed time and squads alive!\n\nDownside?\n\nWell you cannot replay the missions you did :(\n\n-> be aware I only played 3 hours , but it's on one day .

Here you go!\n\nPros: Dawn of war II is a game that involves you, a force commander of the Blood Ravens space marine chapter doing things for your Chapter (Avoiding spoilers) average space marine stuff right? Wrong. The campaign is a detailed, canon, and fun experience when played alone or with up to one friend and you can never be short of a good mission in the Campaign mode. Multiplayer is largely outdated by Dawn of war II Retributions multiplayer last stand and base multiplayer. Largely due to this you wont find hardly anyone online anymore on this game in particular.\n\nCons: Sometimes I think of myself as repeating the missions but with diffrent objectives and stuff, although the campaign is good it ends up getting repetitive after a few playthroughs this being my 4th. In co-op campaign game ending bugs on connection and during matches is common, not to mention unresponsiveness to commands.\n\nVerdict: This game is a rock on solid for anyone who loves the Warhammer 40k franchise or just likes to shoot xenos in the name of the Emperor. You will find hours of enjoyment and replayability always wondering what new wargear you can earn again and some diffrent choices mid campaign, and you would be happy with the Co-op system that allows for 1 buddy to share Cyrus, Avitus, You, Thaddeus, and Tarkus with eachother.\n\n\n","January 7","true","19.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Aside from a couple of missions, you'll be in control of 4 out of 6 squads of Space Marines - which to me makes them feel more like the elite force and super soldiers they're supposed to be - and you're free to choose which squads you use and what equipment they'll carry. Do you hand your Scout sergeant a sniper rifle or a shotgun? Do you field a Devastator Squad for ranged support and firepower or an Assault Squad to take the fight to the enemy? Combined with RPG elements like skills and loot drops and 3 different enemy factions (Orks, Eldar and Tyranids), I found myself spending an awful amount of time in-between missions deciding what approach to use and loved it.\n\nOn the battlefield, gameplay is about positioning and micromanaging your squads and their abilities and accessories (like grenades and turrets). I felt like I spent more time thinking and planning while customizing their loadouts than during battles, but its still great fun. There're main and optional missions and they're quite repetitive, but altering my force composition and loadouts made each deployment feel sufficiently fresh for me.\n\nMy only gripe is that the cover system doesn't feel precise enough at times. Sometimes your squad ends up in front of cover instead of safely behind it.\n\nAnd speaking of cover, DoW 2 has pretty lovely cover destruction.\n\nI'm not sure how much exactly I'd rate DoW 2, but it's at least an 8.6/10 for me.","February 24","true","15.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Here you go!\n\nPros: Dawn of war II is a game that involves you, a force commander of the Blood Ravens space marine chapter doing things for your Chapter (Avoiding spoilers) average space marine stuff right? Wrong. The campaign is a detailed, canon, and fun experience when played alone or with up to one friend and you can never be short of a good mission in the Campaign mode. Multiplayer is largely outdated by Dawn of war II Retributions multiplayer last stand and base multiplayer. Largely due to this you wont find hardly anyone online anymore on this game in particular.\n\nCons: Sometimes I think of myself as repeating the missions but with diffrent objectives and stuff, although the campaign is good it ends up getting repetitive after a few playthroughs this being my 4th. In co-op campaign game ending bugs on connection and during matches is common, not to mention unresponsiveness to commands.\n\nVerdict: This game is a rock on solid for anyone who loves the Warhammer 40k franchise or just likes to shoot xenos in the name of the Emperor. You will find hours of enjoyment and replayability always wondering what new wargear you can earn again and some diffrent choices mid campaign, and you would be happy with the Co-op system that allows for 1 buddy to share Cyrus, Avitus, You, Thaddeus, and Tarkus with eachother.\n\n\n","January 7","true","19.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You tend to be vastly outnumbered, but good use of your abilities will give you the upper hand.\n\nCo-op is where this game shines. You can give control of 1-3 of your heroes to your friend while you focus on your own. And then there's Last Stand, which I gave its own review.

It's a squad-based top-down shooter. I liked the original DOW because I'm a fan of Starcraft and I liked this unique take on traditional RTS games, so when I bought DOW2 thinking they just improved on the original formula, I was extremely disappointed to find that they didn't improve the original forumla, they scraped it to make an entirely new game. This would better off be marketed as a different installment to the Warhammer franchise as opposed to the sequel of Dawn of War.\n\nIs it fun? Yes, but I can't recommend it knowing that people liked DOW1 for what it was and will be expecting DOW2 to be more of that, which it isn't.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Klingenmeister/recommended/15620/","Klingenmeister","Klingenmeister","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Klingenmeister/","104 products in account","I dont really know, how I should think about this game. While I played Dawn of War for its multiplayer, and Dark Crusade for its campaign (and multiplayer), Dawn of War 2 is like the two side of a blade.\n\nThe campaign was...well...more than great, it was awesome! While you had simple unit progression in Dark Crusade, you had now the control over small squads you were able to level up, skill and equip!\nThe campaign story itself wasnt that great sadly. The multiplayer is a desaster!\n\nPlaying as the Bloodravens again, you have to defend their home system against a big horde of orcs and later tyranids.\nThe campaign works like a round strategy game, where you equip your squads, control your planets and choose missions based on their urgency, difficulty and reward.\nChoosing a mission, the real game begins in RTS style and you have up to four unit groups to control. Every group is lead by a hero unit, that has special abilitys and weapons.\n\nMostly fighting against overwelming enemy forces, you often have to fight tricky and stealthy, use good tactics and know, how to use your forces abilitys.\n\nWith every mission you get XP and items and can specialize your troops on melee or ranged combat, health and ability points. You get new weapons and new equipment, and sometimes gamechanger like the terminator armor, that awesomely upgrades your troops (except the scout of course) and gave me a big wtf with the upgraded Space Marine Stormtroopers, with teleport and big hammers. Awesome!\n\nHaving 4 units in every mission but a lot more usable units in your rooster, you can choose, which units you use in a mission, desiding on their abilitys and firepower and the enemys you will face.\n\nNow two things shall be said:\n\nThe campaign is theoretically endless. You can play as many missions as you want. No pressure to do the final missions. You just have to hold down the enemys enough to keep the Xenos Infection low.\n\nThe whole campaign is coop. Instead of 4 units, each player controls 2. Nothing more to say.\n\n\nNow the big bad:\n\nBeside the campaign, there wasnt really anything useful left in this game. I tried the multiplayer, but was highly disappointed. Buildings are completely gone in this game. You only have a main building and troops. Confusing, frustrating and totaly not RTS like. I played Dawn of War for a long time and I played Starcraft and Age of Empires 2 and I couldnt get any fun in the Dawn of War 2 multiplayer.\n\nI would like to give this game a good rating for its awesome campaign, but it hasnt much to offer beside it. It is like a HD version of Dawn of War without RTS gameplay.

It seldom shuts down cleanly, nor does the steam client always recover. This is likely related, as rebooting completely fixes it temporarily.\n\nThere are multiple places in the various maps where troops get stuck, and without warning 25% of your team is now useless. When it happens more than once in a mission you end up unable to finish.\n\nThis is all made worse because there is no way to restart a mission. The challenge of not being able to replay is great, but when the game itself is this buggy it becomes frustrating, to the point of wondering why you even bothered.\n\nI can usually overlook bugs and other problems when a game shows this much promise, but in this case the promises are empty and I have to give it a thumbs down. Which makes me sad.\n\n","November 9, 2014","false","24.4"," 0 of 18 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","18","0","0"

The visuals and voices also al feel well-scripted and satisfyingly re-create the chaos we've come to expect from the battlefield.\n\nHowever, if you're not a fan of Space Marines you'll probably be disappointed to discover the single player campaign is somewhat frustratingly geared only to this particular race. Furthermore, DOW1 actually attempted to characterise the protagonist through its cutscenes (Including a last minute plot twist that I found truly touching!) and this is where DOW 2 falls down a bit. Nobody has any real emotion aside from heroic anger or angry heroics, the Marines all talk with an irritatingly fake batman voice and the mute protagonist fails to strike any sympathy with me as a player. This is what comes of Games Workshop trying to characterise a race who are all literally clones of one another.\n\nSo you'll find the meat of this game (The other 3 races!) in the multiplayer and custom game mode, and this makes for staisfying, if somewhat repetitive, fun. However you should prepare to be screwed around by EA-level connection issues as the game insists you connect to windows live even if you want to play offline, which earlier games managed to do without and adds absolutely nothing to the gameplay. I cannot fathom why anybody felt it needed this feature.\n\nEven though the game is competant in single player and multiplayer scenarios, it just can't marry the two together as seamlessly as Dark Crusade did. So yes it's a good game, but it's just not as rich with variety as Dark Crusade was. I don't see why it would have been impossible to have a DC-style campaign mode with four playable races, or even a multiplayer campaign of the same nature where multiple players fight their campaigns across a planet. So in the end it's not a terrible game, it just feels like it took away features from earlier games that worked, added features nobody wanted, and somehow makes the already characterless Space Marines feel even blander.","May 14, 2014","true","107.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

RTS games normally bore me a bit and I haven't really been absorbed by the genre since the old Red Alert/Tiberian Sun games.\n\nI do like that they seem to have cut out all the boring RTS stuff, like base-building. Instead, you get to wander around as a gang and just belt the tar out of Orks. It's very much an all-action RTS, and beginner-friendly for a total n00b like me.\n\nThe only downside so far was that I put in a few hours on the demo, to gauge whether or not it was the game for me. After buying the full game, it seemed to wipe my saved game, so I am having to redo a fairly big chunk.\n\nCool game, with nice vivid graphics and plenty of senseless OTT violence to make it both challenging and fun.","December 1, 2014","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Campaign is ok but not great. Fans of base-building RTS's will not enjoy this, it's more focused on combat but retains silly immersion-breaking things like instant reinforcements that magically appear out of thin air when you stand next to a comms relay. Oh well. There is a campaign meta-game, but it's not terribly well clear, you may be 80% through it before you figure it out, WITH having read on the internet about the game a bunch. There's also a problem with choosing and picking what squads (really, personalities lol) to take - choose Cyrus for too long and then realize he's a pain in the butt to use compared to Thaddeus - now Thaddeus is behind the power curve.\n\nWatch some videos, make your own mind up.

It's go a mix of RTS thinking, small unit tactics, and RPG customization. Your troops are not mindless, faceless, indentical low-poly meat shields. Each squad leader has their unique on-battleifeld skills and off-battlefield personality. You get to know the characters as people and quickly get attached to them. The story is intense and full of twists and turns. But all this cool stuff about plot and character developement wouldn't be worth anything if it didn't have a solid foundation. Fortunately, Dawn of War II DOES have excellent mechanics and gameplay. I never felt like the game was "cheating" or that the battles were unfair. If I failed a mission, it was always because of my own poor decision. I could indentify the moment things started going wrong and what I did to lead myself there. What this means is that no mission is truly "impossible." Even the hardest, most crazy-difficult missions are totally doable if you're smart. The flip side of this is that the game will make you WORK to EARN that victory. The game does not spell things out for you, hold your hand, or do much of anything to point you in the right direction. All it gives you is an objective and a team of heavily armed Space Marines--and really, what more could you ask for?\n\nI'd recommend this to everyone.

Set in the deep, rich, and dark Warhammer 40K Universe sets a wonderful stage for the mechanics to unfold. It's a far cry from the base building, micromanaging sort of RTS IE Starcraft, as well as it's prequel DoW I (which was closer to traditional RTS play). Usually managing four squads at a time, the way you use, equip, and level your squads (led by a "hero" unit) add huge amounts of replayability to the single player campaign as you are pitted against "countless billions" (several thousand).\n\nNow that the game is switching over to Steamworks, it actually works.

Starcraft was firstly constructed as Blizzard's ♥♥♥♥-poor attempt at obtaining a Games Workshop license. (Which they failed at obtaining) The result of the failure to obtain the lincense was that most Characters in Starcraft have no depth beneath the surface and the entire plot of the game is a shallow heartless copy of Warhammers themes since Blizzard are babies that claim to know when a product is bad, yet release a copy of every other game, like:\n\nMagic: The Gathering (Hearthstone), Starcraft (Warhammer) Warcraft (Everquest/LOTR) HotS (Every MOBA/ARTS ever made)  Diablo is the only game Blizzard actually makes that's not a direct shallow copy of another game, and let's face it, Diablo sucks ♥♥♥♥ in comparison to PoE or even Dungeons of Dredmor.\n\nI'd like to also support another previous comment I made (circa 2012):\n" you should from point of purchase hate all Starcraft players with a burning passion, even if you consider them friends."\n\nThe thing is, Warhammer is just a better universe, hands down and the hype bbehind Starcraft is due to Blizzards inability to understand how an RTS should work and instead has made everything so linear that starcraft matches last 10-20 minutes. So with that out of the way let's begin!\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\nSo, How was Dawn of War II?\n\nDawn of War II was a terrible sequel to Dawn of War I, but is that a bad thing?\n\nIt was complete tripe that adapted the RTS genre in needless ways and scrapped the RTS staple of Base-Building. Saying this, Dawn of War II had some great ♥♥♥♥ going on. To say Dawn of War II detracted from Dawn of War I isn't fair, Dawn of War II is a game in it's own right that tried to be new and innoative and ended up being good, but not Dawn of War. They should've called this "Warhammer: Tacticus Comandus" or something similar in High Gothic.\n\nThe thing I personally like about Dawn of War II is wargear, and how fleshed out it was. Another thing was the group mechanics, rather than focusing on multiple squadrons of silly spess marines you focused on one teeny tiny group which gave way more oppourtunity for individual thought and individual storylines, rather than just full-scale war.\n\nDawn of War II was more ARTS than RTS and I think it's a damn shame that was the case, but whatever, it's still a good game, miles better than Starcraft, that's for ♥♥♥♥ing sure.","December 22, 2012","true","240.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Usually managing four squads at a time, the way you use, equip, and level your squads (led by a "hero" unit) add huge amounts of replayability to the single player campaign as you are pitted against "countless billions" (several thousand).\n\nNow that the game is switching over to Steamworks, it actually works.

You play as a squad leader of Space Marines, whom if you've played the first DoW games you'd recognise some of them. You then go through the campaign completing the main story arch and doing side missions at the same time, upgrading and levelling up your hero squads as you do. It stays true to the 40K lore and it's a lot of fun controlling and playing as the Space Marines.\n\nHowever fun this game is, there were a few things that brought it down for me. For starters the Games For Windows Live. It's an unecessary program that got bundled into it and it does make matchmaking more of a pain than necessary. Also the maps get re-used, often. Many battles feels like you've fought them before and, in many cases, you have. This can spoil the fun somewhat.\n\nOnline is fun. I highly recommend playing 3 vs 3 due to the team based nature of the game. I recommend this game to RTS fans only if you're looking for something less competitive.","March 5, 2011","true","29.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/beardiman/recommended/15620/","beardiman","Sam","http://steamcommunity.com/id/beardiman/","614 products in account","Not really a sequel, but still damn good. Dawn of War II takes some concepts from Dawn of War I and flips them upside down. The two games are essentially two completely different games that borrow from one another liberally, and should be seen as such. Usually when a series attempts such a drastic change, it can result into a inconsistent mess. Certainly, Dawn of War II has its own share of embitter fans who feel somewhat let down by the switch of focus in Dawn of War II. But at its heart, if seen somehow as seperate as Dawn of War I, DoWII is a really great game. Sure, the series does lose some of the intrique and atmosphere of the original. If anything DoWII seems somewhat cookie cutter, at least at first. But give it time you will find that you may appreciate it's unique strengths. Windows live also brings the experience down some, enforcing its absurdly intrusive UI over the game's menus. Also if you are looking for a traditional RTS you may find yourself a bit underwhelmed by DoW II's single player campaign.  One of the cool things this game does is take the focus away from resource gathering and obnoxious base building, and replace it with character development with RPG elements, and loot. In this sense, the game plays more like a dungeon crawler, with each mission acting as something of a quest in which you need to achieve objectives A, B, and C, and obtain such and such loot. Its fun, and addictive. At least this is the campaign. The multiplayer may be more familiar to fans of the series as it takes a more capture and conquer that people loved about the original. All in all, it should be said that this well made, if somewhat a departure from the normal RTS/RPG type game. If you are looking for more Space Marine action, this game and the corresponding expansions will keep you entertained for some time.","November 27, 2013","true","8.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Instead of riding on the success of the original's fundamental RTS roots, DoW II completely changes the rules, becoming a RTT (tactics) game instead of RTS (strategy). Base building is removed, squads can only reinforce at home, and tactical, destructive cover lies everywhere in each detailed map. This is of course akin to Relic's previous project, Company of Heroes.\n\nWhile many remain divided on the transformation, I believe Dawn of War II is a far deeper and more detailed game because of it. While unfortunately the absurdly large and bloody battles of 40K have been scaled down, the detail is even more impressive and the action is just as visceral, and the destructible environments add to this factor. Perhaps the best addition are the RPG levelling and wargear elements applied to heroes, adding to their grandeur and allowing rich customizability, even in multiplayer.","January 29, 2011","true","175.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
