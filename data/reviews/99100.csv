I was really looking forward to playing this game, because I am a fan of the actual roleplaying game. To say the least, I was thoroughly disappointed.\n\nThe game suffers from lighting errors early in the game, which already establish a bad image for the rest of the game. The annoying lighting errors aside, the actual graphics of the game aren't horrible, but aren't impressive either. I recall some texture errors on armors, in which a glitchy texture covered the entire armor set. In addition, I also recall many of the armor models being reused, so  quite a few of the armor sets look the same.\n\nThe actual game play is accurately described in the description as, "hack and slash", so I can't complain about the mostly tedious game play. There really isn't much room for character development, which is limited to four different classes, each with a set race. I will however say that despite limitations, the concept of leveling up, and upgrading your equipment, is what keeps the game playable.\n\nAs for the actual storyline, I won't spoil any of it, but I will say that in my opinion, the storyline isn't satisfying and the final boss fight is nothing short of frustrating and redundant (and for me, one of the lowest points of the game).\n\nIf all of the bugs were fixed, and there was more room for character development, then with some expansions onto the actual content (like maybe a sandbox mode or more of a storyline, because the actual game is very short), then this game would be a decent game. However, at its current phase, I cannot say I would recommend it, and overall I was disappointed.","November 25, 2013","false","16.9"," 94 of 102 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","94","102","0","0"

In the note Volo spake in words with his famous quill:\n\nSir Spamicide, one best not slip a foot into this false interpretation of our wondrous realm, or thou will surely feel as thou hath been flatulated upon by a Pit Fiend and under compulsion to consume the fecal pie of an Ettin, which is the consistency of packed clay containing various undesirable items such as goblin feet, unusual bones, teeth, hair, mushroom-like gut flora and at least a few fingernails. I know this my dear friend as I have played the game and only Khelben Blackstaff of Waterdeep could restore my sanity. So, I extend this offer to you or any of your companions that hath endured the torturous experience of this game: Stop by Neverwinter any day during Kythorn and meet me at the Sunken Flagon where Sand, a mage of renown and thine own self will cast an "erase selected memory" spell, followed by a "permanence" spell, which are the instruments Kehlben used to cure me of the memory; we perform said services free of charge. With departure I must bestow this wisdom upon you - only play games that have been developed on the Black Isle near Evermeet or by the Biowarians deep with the Jungles of Chult.\n\nSafe travels my good sir,   ~Volo","October 2, 2015","false","0.2"," 55 of 72 people (76%) found this review helpful 51 people found this review funny","76","55","72","51","0"

I think with just one small patch fixing these few things could have given this game more favor and sales. At 5$ or less you'll get several hours of hack & slash + loot out of the experience. no voice acting and a LOT of backtracking make this one only for big big fans of the genre though.","January 7, 2013","true","14.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The graphics aren't that bad, but they ARE bland and the faces are ugly as hell. It's like I'm looking at people with down syndrome (no offense meant). Add some (and now I'm being generous) bugs and glitches and NO FUN whatsoever and this game is the result. I normally love dungeon crawlers, but the combat is clumsy, as well as the interface. The loot is crap. NPC's are (or get) stuck in environments and objects, (solved) quests aren't always triggered, the camera swirls around so much that it disorients me and I could go on and on and on.

Those were fairly uninventive RPGs (no party, no significant role-playing or dialogue) but still enjoyable for all that. I was looking forward to more of the same.\n\nBut Daggerdale doesn't even reach the unimpressive standards of a console RPG. It is a dull and dreary game. The level design is exceedingly linear, and every foot of it looks the same. The music is perhaps the most uninspired I have heard in any recent game, and the "Simlish" speech (doubtlessly used to save on localization costs; why pay for voice-actors when you can just use random grunting in place of speech?) is terrible. The controls are sluggish, the auto-targeting is terrible and the action is poorly paced. Nor is there any redeeming quality in the loot; none of the weapons are in anyway impressive. Story and setting are equally under-whelming. And the savepoints are poorly placed.\n\nTo top everything else off, the game is buggy; textures didn't show up, the game crashed randomly and too often my on-screen avatar just stopped responding to my controls (my favorite bug is how, in the climatic quicktime event -yes, the game resorts to those, too- my character wasn't even visible on the screen! The only possible saving graces to this game was the inclusion of co-op play... but then, I'm not sure I'd want to subject a friend to this game anyway. The four-hour gameplay, normally a disadvantage, was a god-send since I'm not sure I could have stomached more of this game anyway.\n\nDaggerdale sucks. Even at sale it isn't worth the price.
