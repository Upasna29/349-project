You experience her missions in Europe through her dreams.  In those dreams you become the actor and rely on stealth, wits, and weapons to take out enemies and complete mission objectives.  You'll start with a knife and have to be very careful to get to the first objective.  It gets harder and more interesting as you acquire more talents and weapons.  It is very challenging to  maintain stealth and operate with very limited weapons and ammo, which makes it very satisfying when you get to a mission objective.\n\nGameplay was engaging, exciting, and sometimes spooky.  The music certainly sets the tone for you secretative missions and dangerious scenarios.  The atmosphere is close to art and can evoke a lot of emotion!\n\nWhile I thought it was a pretty good game, I have very mixed feelings about recommending it.  So this is a conditional  recommendation subject to some serious "ifs".\n\nThe game is old and relies on the outdated checkpoint system instead of real saves and the controls are sometimes clunky.  It probably won't run without some work on your part.  Unless you are willing to download additional drivers, tinker with file names, and maybe edit configuration files in an emergency; this game probably isn't for you.\n\nIf on the other hand you are willing to fix a few things on your own, if you have the mettle and patience to stalk and kill quietly, and if you can live with some gameplay bugs; then the game is pretty riveting and exciting. It could be a lot better by today's standards, but was pretty good when it was released.\n\nI enjoyed playing for a short time, but decided to move on because of problems with the controls lagging and getting me killed when I played with an Xbox 360 controller with Steam Overlay running.\n\n.....a.  It works flawlessly with the Xbox 360 controller if you can live without the Steam Overlay.\n.....b.  If you want to do screen  shots with the F12 key, then the changes you have to make to get Steam Overlay to work may cause laggy performance with the controller, which makes it harder to play the game successfully.\n.....c.  If you play with keyboard and mouse, the controls are flawless with or without the Steam Overlay - definitetly best played with a keyboard/mouse combo.\n\nFIXING GAME PROBLEMS\n\n1.  Game Fails to Launch Issue\n\n....a.  Install the NVidia Legacy PhysX Drivers at\n\nhttp://www.nvidia.com/object/physx-9.12.1031-legacy-driver.html\n\n\n2.  Steam Overlay Fix needed if you want to do screenshots with F12\n\n....a.  Navigate to your Steam\SteamApps\common\velvet assassin folder\n....b.  Rename Launcher.exe to Launcher2.exe\n....c.  Rename Replay.exe to Launcher.exe\n\nCaution Note:  May cause laggy performance or other game issues\n\n3.  Checkpoint Progress Loop\n\nIt is possible to get to a point where you are encountering overwhelming odds and the most recent checkpoint just returns you to the same situation where you inevitable are killed and returned again and again like the movie Groundhog Day.  In\nsuch a case it maybe necessary to edit the values in the follow files at\n\nSteam\SteamApps\common\velvet assassin\aio\n\n....a. difficulty.cfg (NPCDamage and PlayerDamage - decrease the former/increase the latter)\n....b. weapons.cfg (Adjust damage  depending on situation)\n\nPROS\n\n*  Very chilling look into a very dark time in history through the eyes of a behind the lines assassin\n*  Good story style\n*  Edge of your seat encounters\n*  Offers around 40 hours of lay time - far more than a lot of other similar assassin type games\n\nCONS\n\n*  Predictable enemies and unrealistic situations with enemies facing away from threat vectors\n*  Stealth is inconsistent - in some areas you appear to be hidden, but can be discovered where in another location the same factors would render you invisible to the enemy\n*  AI is weak\n*  Sometimes gameplay is forced to a linear path and slow\n*  Sometimes controller mode controls are non-responsive resulting in you getting killed; e.g. you must be in a precise position to execute a knife kill or you just stand there getting shot\n*  Velvet Assassin was released in 2009.  Later that year the developer studio, Replay,  closed its doors due to insolvency.  As a result there is no developer support for this game.","December 7, 2013","true","3.2"," 183 of 209 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","183","209","0","4"

Also, the checkpoints are placed pretty conveniently\n+ it's a pretty cheap game\n+ protagonist has a nice ♥♥♥ indeed\n\nCons:\n- the AI is stupid sometimes. However it didn't upset me much, because that's the case with most stealth games (remember splinter cell aka "lightbulb assassin")\n- shooting sucks.It's fortunate however that you will stab people most of the time\n- the game is linear for most of the time\n+/- checkpoint system again( for me it's a + however)\n\nThanks for reading.","May 3, 2015","true","10.0"," 194 of 237 people (82%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","82","194","237","7","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/paper-tiger/recommended/16720/","paper-tiger","Paper Tiger","http://steamcommunity.com/id/paper-tiger/","185 products in account","The Good:\n- Great lighting and environment design add immersion and remain consistent throughout\n- Unique protagonist and narrative offer a refreshing perspective of the WWII setting\n- Sound design is good; both music and voice-acting are executed well and add immersion\n\nThe Bad:\n- Very "trial and error"-based; requires A LOT of patience\n- The story is unimpressive and many levels feel fragmented or unrelated to each other\n- Controls feel clunky and restricting (in both moving around and in combat)\n\nIn Velvet Assassin, the player takes on the role of British agent Violette Summers, infiltrating enemy lines to combat Nazi forces during WWII. Velvet Assassin offers an interesting and unique, albeit frustrating, stealth experience. While the game does some things well, it does many things poorly.\n\nTo begin with, Velvet Assassin's story is not very impressive. I found this to be the most disappointing part of the game, especially considering the high potential set in place by the game's unique protagonist and premise. Taking place during WWII, Velvet Assassin sets itself apart from other WWII games through the way in which the story is told.\nAfter suffering a near-fatal gunshot wound during an assignment, agent Violette Summers remains bed-ridden in a state of comatose, recalling her missions through dream sequences. At the beginning of each level, Summers provides a little briefing on her mission, helping along the story via narration.\n\nHowever, while helping to take down Nazi forces is satisfying in its own right, the goals of each level are pretty much unrelated; one level will revolve around sabotaging a German ammo depot, while the next level involves assassinating a key target. While these objectives seem like fairly standard spy operations, Velvet Assassin does a poor job of tying the levels into an overarching story, making the goals of each of the levels feel insignificant.\nThe game's story also finishes off in a sort of strange and unsatisfying dead end, which led me to question whether the developers had a different ending planned originally that was scrapped.\n\nWhile Velvet Assassin certainly has its flaws, it does do some things well.\n\nFirst of all, the sound of the game is great; the voice acting of both the protagonist as well as the frequenlty overheard conversations of patrolling enemies are believable and interesting. The music also does a great job of adding to the immersion and intensity of sneaking around in the shadows.\n\nThe environment and scenery of the game is also another high point. It is clear that a great level of detail was placed into crafting each of the levels, and the striking silhouettes created by the game's bold colors and deep shadows are dramatic and impressive.\n\nThe stealth in the game is suspenseful and carries with it a rewarding feeling when exectuted properly. The lighting really comes into play here; as long as Violette remains in the shadows, she is almost invisible to enemies, allowing her to close in for the kill. Velvet Assassin's lighting and ambience in each of the levels is excellent, helping to create interesting and believable environments. The game also provides ample opportunity for the player to manipulate the environment to create more shadows (e.g. disabling a fuse box to shut off the lights) so as to remain hidden.\nSome reviewers criticize the AI in this game for being "blind," but in reality, I think the portrayal of stealth in Velvet Assassin is actually among the most realistic I've seen in a game.\n\nHowever, the realistic and intense stealth does not necessarily translate well into fun gameplay. Ironically, Velvet Assassin's heavy emphasis on stealth is also what cripples the game in many other departments. First, the overall combat in the game is quite lackluster; aiming weapons, particularly in firefights, feels clunky and unnatural. While the game is obviously focused on stealth, there are several instances when sneaking around enemies is not an option and the player is forced into awkward combat situations.\n\nAdditionally, because crawling around and methodically eliminating enemies one-by-one is so time-consuming and tense, it makes it all the more frustrating when you are caught while trying to take out the last enemy and are forced to repeat the painstaking process all over again.\n\nHowever, in spite of all of its flaws, Velvet Assassin is not a terrible game. It's a game that, unfortunately, could have been realized far better, but is certainly enjoyable at times, thanks to beautiful visual design, unique narrative and suspenseful stealth.","September 13, 2014","true","10.2"," 97 of 105 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","97","105","0","7"

The mechanics are horribly broken. Sometimes they can't see you hiding in a shadow in spitting distance.

It wants to be a stealth action game drenched in gritty realism, but the level of bad game design decisions and massive number of bugs keep me from recommending this game to anybody.\n\n* Don't expect to be able to avoid or sneak past encounters. Several guards and soliders carry critical items you'll need to proceed. Which guards, you may ask? The game won't tell you until they're dead.\n\n*AI alternates between being too dumb to breathe and psychic supersoldiers. Sometimes enemies will spot you even though you're clearly in complete darkness. Sometimes they won't. Sometimes enemy soldiers won't be able to shoot you on full auto from three feet away. Sometimes you'll blink and fall over dead. Sometimes you'll kill an enemy and it will be completely silent. Sometimes it will alert the enemies the next room over.\n\n* The shooting mechanics are bad, supposedly to discourage mindless combat. But then the game forces mindless combat on you, most of the time without warning you.\n\n* The environments look good, but they'll repeat themselves so many times it legitimately feels like you're just playing the same level again and again.\n\n* Checkpoints happen once every 20-30 minutes. In gameplay sections with lots of enemies where most of your time is spent waiting doing nothing, this can get very frustrating very fast.\n\nWhatever this game's strengths, they're far overshadowed by really poor design and technical mishaps that really takes me out of the experience.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zenithsal/recommended/16720/","zenithsal","SirDimples","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zenithsal/","455 products in account","I bought Velvet Assassin on discount, it was very cheap and looked interesting. In the beginning it had all the right boxes ticked and I thought surely this is one of those underrated games. After several hours playing I can confidently say it isn't.\n\nIt's difficult to pinpoint exactly what is wrong with it, it has good presentation and production value as well as pretty good voice acting. In reality I can't really say something is "wrong" with it, just that the designer(s) made a heap of really weird decisions that led to an incoherent downright boring game.\n\nHere's a list of things that I consider to be bad design decisions that hurt the game a lot:\n\nYou're an assassin and obviously level designers have gone through the difficulty of setting up things so you can get in take out your targets and get out without being spotted. Except when the game suddenly expects you to blow up soldiers, electrocute them, set them to fire in order to get the next "rusty key" as a drop from dead enemies which will open the door out to the next area. That kinda kills the whole purpose of being an assassin.\n\nAt times instead of giving you something that a female assassin could use to escape, you get a shotgun. Really? a shotgun.. you couldn't have picked something quieter. I played past half the game and not once did I get a silenced submachine gun, sniper or a cross bow or something like that which all existed during the timeline of the game and more assassin-y.\n\nFirst few chapters I noticed the number of weapons and items was very limited, I thought it's going to get better and surely some new mechanics will be introduced as I progress through the game? No. I just kept replaying the same mechanics with the same weapons, no feeling of progression at all for several chapters. The only time something new happened is when I got to wear an officer disguise to sneak into a heavily guarded place by just walking. This disguise only lasted a segment of a chapter and that was the only time I got the option to do it so far.\n\nCharacter level progression could simply be based on experience gained through gameplay, but that makes sense and the designer(s) of Velvet Assassin don't seem to favor that. There are "collectibles" you have to pick up to get experience and some enemies drop collectibles when killed, which is yet another contradiction to the whole assassin thing.\n\nI played past half the game and I still didn't get any real story. You got a sort of description of your mission at the beginning of each chapter but that's not a story. Then you get some weird morphine-induced flashbacks. Still not a story. Then the game shows you sleeping in a hospital and two french men discussing killing you or something, repeatedly, for several chapters. Still not a story. I'm really confused who am I supposed to be? who gives me orders? what's my goal? None of that is clarified.\nIf Velvet Assassin had a real story, richer consistent gameplay mechanics, and a coherent progression, it might have become a great game.","October 23, 2014","false","6.2"," 102 of 137 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","102","137","0","7"

The game has an incredibly long playtime for a Stealth title, with highly realistic and exceptionally strategic stealth gameplay mechanics. The biggest downside of Velvet Assassin lies within the control scheme during intense combats (which are relatively important and unavoidable towards the end of the game), which is rather stiff, with the disadvantegous camera angles. Although those situations can get real tricky and slightly frustrating, they at least aren't difficulty-breaking, and can be gotten through with a bit of thinking.\n\nAlthough I do feel the protagonist of the game (a female undercover agent) is slightly over-sexualized, I think I should leave that for another discussion.\n\nVelvet Assassin - 7 out of 10 to me. If you enjoy the stealth genre, then this game definitely won't disappoint.","December 4, 2013","true","12.5"," 69 of 86 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","69","86","0","0"

(will mention it a bit later)\n- repetitive remarks from the enemies.\n- the shooting can be at times frustrating. especially the last mission. (will go in to detail later as well)\n- at times enemies know where you are, even when hiding in the dark.\n- HUBs dont really allow you to go around enemies. forceful confrontation is required.\n- the protagonists character is not explained at all.\n- no frontal attacks possible unless in morphine mode.\n- the menu cant be operated with a mouse.\n- must wait for for the counter to show the new number after reloading.\n\npros:\n- very good voice acting.\n- great atmosphere.\n- beautiful lightening.\n- graphics are beautiful as well.\n- the german enemies speak actual german (which should be expected since the company is from germany).\n- the enemies have at times interesting and funny conversations.\n- the english subtitles are very well translated. (i know german).\n- it has its challenging moments.\n- change costumes to walk among the enemy. (but has its cons as well)\n- upgrading system.\n- the game requires you to be careful.\n- you can lure enemies in to the dark by whistling.\n- peak through keyholes.\n\nok, now to the nit picky stuff.\nas i said; the AI has its dumb moments. even when coming across a body, they will look around but then they stop and keep patrolling their fixed root like nothing happened. they dont call for backup or report it, nothing. also, most of the time they know exactly where you are when alarmed, even when hiding in the dark without making a peep or doing anything that would get their attention. and im not talking about enemies who clearly saw me making a mistake, even those who come later to the party where everyone is dead and they still see you in the dark. their weapons already aim in your direction even when a wall, crate is in their field of view. but shoot of course once there is no obstacle in their way.\nin one mission when being inside the gestapo building, the enemies spotted me when i was looking through a keyhole to see if the area is clear for me to walk out. for some reason, the soldier who walks past the door was suddenly alarmed and pointed his gun at the door. also oddly he and the others, who were a floor below, never bothered to enter the room i was in. or the the once below bothering to come up. also when being on the catwalk, the enemy below was alarmed since i walked exactly above him. nothing really happened since i was above him and generally invincible since i was wearing a SS uniform. thats a mechanic that could have been looked in too.\n\nwhich leads me to the change of costumes.\nits a plus of course but it has its downside as well that you cant be too close to the enemies. you have a depleting bar when you get too close to an enemy. if you are too close, you get recognized as a spy. i sure would have no complaints if a good looking woman (and she sure looks good in a uniform) comes close to me. like to know how every enemy would know every single female SS officer. would make maybe sense with officers but not some random soldier. you have no chance of being stealthy either.\n\nthe shooting mechanic has its moments as well.\nespecially the last mission you are forced to shoot instead of being stealthy. her accuracy is not always good. but these of the enemies are very precise and can hit you from a distance with a 98% success rate. also it gave me the impression that an enemy can handle a few shots and the other can handle half a magazine. so the ending led to some very frustrating outbursts.\nthe reloading can be very frustrating as well. you must wait for the counter to display that it is full. if you start changing weapons or put the weapon away, it will not count as a reload. even when she clearly has finished it visually, you must wait a second for it to be displayed.\n\nso much for the picky parts.\nnow to the parts why i ended up liking the game, even after mentioning a lot of the bad things of the game.\nthe stealth was very solid and you get immersed quickly. stabbing the enemy did not get old. she kills them in different ways like putting a bullet through their heads, stabbing them between the legs, slicing their throats, and stabbing them repeatably which are all visually very violent.\nthe game requires you to be careful and i just had to laugh when reading from others that the "checkpoints are too far away". i never thought they are too far away. they were placed very well. if you rush it, of course you will have issues. you have to be careful and observe the enemies what they are doing and then take them out one by one. avoid using the firearm since you will need it by the end of every mission to shoot your way out.\nthe missions are diverse. so not only "kill this guy and kill that guy". you have to find an fallen agent (and the ending of this mission is not what you expect) or plant a bomb.\n\nalso the germans speak actual german and was amusing at times listening to them. since i know german, after growing up in the german speaking part of switzerland, the repetitive remarks they have are these:\n\nHoffentlich kommt bald die Ablösung. - hopefull the replacement comes soon.\n'nen Schanpps wär jetzt gut. - a schnapps would be good now.\nSo viel Spannung is es ja kaum auszuhalten. - so much tension is excruciating.\nHier passiert ja so wie so nichts. - nothing really happens here.\nUnd wer macht jetzt den Dreck wieder weg? - and who is cleaning up this mess?\nHab sie erwischt. - i got her.\nSieht nicht gar nicht mal so schlecht aus. Das Luder. - doesnt even look that bad. the minx.\n\nthats pretty much it.\n\nthe locations are visually impressive to look at. some of them can be a bit dull but you are in a ghetto, sewers, prison complex, church, catacombs, a huge garden or a village.\nalso you see some graphic scenes as well like dead civilians lie around, hanging from trees, being burned. and children are among them too. so this alone creates a very intense atmosphere. plus the very well made dynamic lighting add more to these scenes.\n\neven when violette at times looks like a plastic doll, so as some enemies, but since you will see her mainly from the back (which is a nice looking back) and the HUBs as such looks really impressive, i think i can close an eye on that little feature.\n\nthe gameplay is solid and works really well with M&K. it displays the M&K buttons, you can customize the layout to your liking but as mentioned before; for some reason you cant operate the menu with a mouse.\n\nso over all, if you like a solid stealth game, have patience and can see away from the bad feature i have mentioned, you might find some enjoyment from this game which i think has been underrated.","July 26, 2015","true","10.6"," 44 of 47 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","44","47","2","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/brumbek/recommended/16720/","brumbek","Brumbek","http://steamcommunity.com/id/brumbek/","501 products in account","Velvet Assassin is a much better game in theory than in practice. It has a great premise: a likable female spy who brutally assassinates Nazis to secretly turn the tide of WWII. To be clear, Velvet is a stealth game clearly designed for sneaking, and yet the stealth gameplay can be exceptionally frustrating.\n\nThe sneaking system is woefully underdeveloped. There are no visibility indicators or radars or cones of vision. Trial and error is all you have. Then there’s the painfully slow sneaking speed. If you remain undetected, you get rewarded with truly great kill animations. If an enemy spots you, you have to run away or rely on wonky combat and AI exploits.\n\nThe game is very linear, with a sort of paint by numbers approach to stealth, resulting in you either going about things the developers’ way or repeatedly dying. The checkpoint system can also be irksome, with some checkpoints quite far apart, making you fearful to fail simply because you don’t want to replay things again.\n\nOn the bright side, the story and briefing cutscenes are done very well, building up believability and intrigue. Very strong voice acting by all characters is also a great boon, with humorous enemy dialogue akin to No One Lives Forever being a highlight. Certain mechanics like shadows, whistling, and stat upgrades do help keep things interesting. Graphically the game is bleak, brown, and barren but occasionally looks quite nice.\n\nOverall, Velvet Assassin only takes about 6 hours to finish on Normal, which is good because by the end I was very ready for it to be over. Despite the frustration there’s something charming about its very old school approach, almost daring you to try to survive. The game clearly isn’t great, but it does have some good elements.

The game is technically a "stealth" game but it reminds me a lot more of the survival horror genre (particularly Silent Hill 3 in terms of controls, mood, its lighting/color scheme and female protagonist--the lady protagonist even shares Heather's psychically controlled pocket flashlight). Calculating open combat engagements is a must unless you plan on reloading quite a bit. The game rewards exploration with collectables, health, ammo, and morphine (Violette's "kill bad guys instantly" juice) hence its strong affinity with the survival horror genre. This is a game about patience, perseverance, and doing it the right way--the way the designers intended--the first time, so it might not jive with the average gamer. As far as the story goes, the lady protagonist is arguably not as fascinating as the real life French-English lady spy she is based on but she is more interesting and "strong" than the average female video game character--albeit she suffers the usual treatment of female characters in video games (she is often seen running about in her nightie) and moonlights as a helpless morphine addict incapacitated in a hospital. Ah well, at least she is complex. I just wish she was savvier in a fight and didn't die instantaneously. But In all honesty, I'm glad she is not a martial arts expert or gun toting "bro-girl," I'm also relieved she isn't a victim (though she is certainly vulnerable). She lends some much needed class to female protagonists and her touted desirability is admirably "kosher" in the sense that she is an independent and "full-bodied" woman--although the German uniform thing, I think, is a little iffy (I think of Charlotte Rampling in the Night Porter). I hope she comes back for a sequel. However, I also kind of feel that this historical fiction based on actual historical figures is better handled by Ubisoft. May Violette one day receive a big budget treatment so she can join the likes of Sam Fisher, Solid Snake, the guy from Thief and all the Brotherhood Assassins as a worthy protagonist.","October 26, 2014","true","4.5"," 33 of 37 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","33","37","0","0"

The biggest issue I suppose would be the bugs, the game has a lot of glitchy-ness or at least that is what I experienced. The missions can be pretty long and with an auto save feature a single bug can have you restarting the entire thing just to get the mission/ level to work properly. This coupled with a fragile main character and a hilariously ineffective stealth system makes for quite a bit of frustration. One moment you can be walking three feet in front of an enemy and he ends up none the wiser, the next your spoted in the dark from 50 feet away and killed by the guys shotgun in a single hit. Overall the stealth is pretty "wishy washy". Another issue I have is that the story itself does not portray the events accurately, if you want to know more about Violette Szabo you can find more information on the internet, this link can get you started. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violette_Szabo  Over all I liked what the game tried to do, it just is not that great "mechanically" and fails to deliver in many areas. The price however makes the game a good buy for what it is, it was 99 cents at the time we bought it and I think even when its not on sale as long as the game is 5 bucks or less its worth your attention. but if you want to skip the frustration and just read the story about Violette, that's a good option as well.","April 22, 2014","true","6.8"," 39 of 49 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","39","49","0","0"

The lead protagionist is Violette Summer, who is a spy in German enemy lines. The game is interesting as its an enjoyable game through its refreshing stealth gameplay and interesting storyline that invests the player into Violette.  I am five hours into the campaign and not done yet, however I can't play it.\n\nI would be recommending this game in an instant if it wasn't for a technical issue that makes the game unplayable. According to the developer this game cannot be played on newer Nvidia drivers. This means that if you attempt to launch the game it automatically crashes. The only fix is to regress to previous nvidia drivers, which is unfortunate as its a pain to do so. According to one of my friends, the game can be played on newer graphics cards but speaking from personal experience on a GTX 560 Ti, I can't play this.\n\nOverall, its a good game but its plagued by the driver issue. In saying that, I wouldn't recommend this game if there was no refund policy, but I suggest purchasing the game and if it doesn't work, refund it.\n\n----\n\nThanks for reading my review!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Krocine/recommended/16720/","Krocine","Krocine","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Krocine/","156 products in account","Velvet Assassin is an excellent game, let me tell you why.\n\nPROS:\nYou're an agent behind enemy lines and you have to take out important people or sabotage bases. The gameplay is great, the stealth system fairly simple; hide in shadows, don't walk in front of people, but it can get pretty intense, especially the later levels where there are less shadows to hide in and you need to perform more daring assassinations on patroling enemies.\n\nThe weapons you get are true to the era (no crossbows or whatever), fitting for an assassin: a knife and a pistol. You can't carry around clunky weapons on your back like you're some sort of Wolfenstien. However there are portions of the game where, after blowing something up, you need a less tacticle approach to escape and the shotgun is your friend. It makes sense, it doesn't seem realistic that you can be a ghost 100% of the time. Besides, if you don't go out with a bang, how are the Nazi's gonna know you were there? :)\n\nContent, I've played the game for about 8 hours and I'm not even halfway done. There's also rewards you get for exploring, albiet within the confines of the level. Not every game has to be open world/sandbox. Also, it seems there's a new way to kill enemies almost every level. The levels are also pretty unique from each other, and a lot of effort was put into level design. It doesn't get dull.\n\nGreat voice acting. Excellent grahpics. Nice execution animations.\n\n\nCONS:\n\nYou can't pick up enemy weapons, which may be helpful if you get discovered. But I guess an assassin doesn't want to be loud even if she's getting shot at.\n\nThe story is a little disjointed. There isn't too much of a connection between missions, but it doesn't hurt to use your imagination a little bit and pretend that the British sent you on a new mission somewhere else, leaving the old mission behind you, cause after all it's finished.\n\nVery rarely the character movements and controls seem unnatural, like when you're trying to sneak around a corner and you have your face pressed right up to it. It's not enough to detract from the fun though. And I feel it's due to the Nvidia physix engine (AMD users can still play the game though!).\n\nCheckpoints happen about four or five times during a mission. If you're trying to play a perfect game, be prepared to reload. But, it's challenging! Not a "kill an enemy, save" type of game.\n\nLeveling up is done through finding hidden collectibles, and if you don't find them you can get underleveled. It doesn't make the game impossible, just harder than it already is.\n\n\nOverall, this is an excellent game even for full price which is still pretty cheap. A great way to spend a few bucks and get a lot out of it. 8.9/10\nAlso, she has a nice butt.","April 9, 2015","true","7.9"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","18","20","2","0"

I found this game genuinely chilling and has numerous dark themes throughout. The devs really nailed it when it comes to the enemies in this game - I quickly learned how hostile and realistically powerful they are. This combined with their ferocious barks in German made me genuinely dread running into one around a corner, or being exposed in broad daylight in near proximity. Playing through each of the somewhat diverse levels (all of which are very dark and gritty - don't expect sunshine, mountains and waterfalls), requires logical thinking. I say this in terms of traversing between light and shadow, and studying each guards movement patterns before moving forth, being prime examples. I like this element as I felt even more engaged in the role of Violette, and in the precarious situations with her.\n\nDespite the challenging and what I found to be personally enjoyable gameplay, I found the storyline was Velvet Assassin's greatest downfall. Throughout the game I found myself puzzled as to where Violette's fight for the Resistance would lead, and did not understand the relation between missions during early parts of the game. It was during the latter portion that I developed a better understanding for her purpose and started seeing a connection between the missions. This is the part of the review which will explain how my player-engagement and excitement quickly turned sour. It was only just as I was becoming heavily invested in the story, that I was completely disappointed.\n\nVelvet Assassin, has one of the most disappointing endings to a video game I have EVER seen.\n\nI of course will not reveal why, as I am not going to spoil the ending. But it was incredibly disappointing.\n\nI would still recommend this game for people to play, for all the other gameplay positives I have highlighted in this review, however I am still shocked by this game's conclusion.\n\nSee for youself.","October 3, 2014","true","16.6"," 19 of 23 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","19","23","0","0"

If you have ever played a decent stealth game this this game will feel natural. I find this a lot of fun the enemy patterns are tight so you have to be patient and watch (YAY), Kill animations feel gruesome and hit hard(why the balls man), The game punishes you hard for ♥♥♥♥ing up or trying to run and gun(oh yea). There are a few times your suppose to run and gun but they tend to give you a shotgun and it's in situations where even the best thief is running for there lives(fuel dump is exploding and such). The story is  meh it drives the plot well but other then that wasn't a perfect fit for me might fit better for others. Exploring could of been better while you do get rewarded for going off track with items and hence experience. The  sidepaths are sadly never too far off the main.\n\n*** 9/3/15 I have played  the last level and yes there is one legitimate criticism of this game. That would be the last level mission 12 and the end 1/5 of mission 11. This is a stealth game you are built like Classic Garret from thief. If you are not attacking from behind 2-3 attacks and your dead. So I can respect what they tried to do with the last level, but it fails and becomes frustrating. You do get a decent gun for this sudden change into a cover shooter but your aim is off at about 50 feet while the enemies can nail you with a shotgun blast from the edge of your view. Even with full strength stars(that the stat that lets you take more hits) and a bullet resistant vest You don't stand a chance in open combat. So it becomes a game of getting them to walk around walls ,through doors, ambushes, and such to kill them and move on.\n\nDoes this ruin the game yes and no. The sudden change is jarring and will ♥♥♥♥ you off, but if you can get past that and use stealth shooter mechanics it stays fun. Setting up ambushes and such still remains fun to me.\n\nDoes this change my opinion on the game and if you should buy it. No it's still a ♥♥♥♥ ton of fun from mission one to most of 11 as a stealth game. I played and stealth killed 90% or so of the enemies up till that point, And still found ways to stealth kill enemies in the last mission as well. ***\n\nDo I recommend this game hell yes it's a fun stealth kill game, Not stealth ghost game though the patterns tend to be too tight, and pathways too narrow for you to leave no trace. Even with the disapointing last level I still recommend it.\n\nPs.... Special Note that in good faith i can not ignore. Last section of the last level sucks. 3 waves of enemies rush a point and you have to kill them. They come in 2s and 3s so it's not that hard. You do get decent ammo and med packs to do it, but it may make you mad.","August 1, 2015","true","29.9"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","16","21","2","0"

Beautiful graphics and so cool to be able to play a female hero for a change. The game is based on historical facts and really gives you a feeling what it was like to be an agent in the second world war. If you love sneaking around, then this is a perfect game for you. It's not easy though. You have to be very patient and study the guards before you make your moves. So you can't just run around in Rambo style, cause you'll be dead soon when you get discovered. The music is really good and ads a lot to the entire atmosphere. All the German soldiers speak real German and it's very interesting to listen to their conversations while sneaking around. The story has a very good premise and it's a story you'll never forget. I definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes stealth games, or people who want to know how it was to be a spy in world war 2.","October 15, 2014","true","29.6"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","6"

Velvet Assassin is a stealth game, plain and simple.  You basically solve puzzle after puzzle on a completely linear path with a half-baked story, set sometime during WWII.  The true objective is never really clear throughout the entire game, all the way to the end.  Even after finishing the game, I felt like I really did nothing special and wished I was never tempted to pick this game up during one of those Steam sales.\n\nThe graphics are bland, you spend a lot time in dimly lit environments, and the sound is not good.\n\nThere are checkpoints sprinkled throughout the game, which save your progress.  These drove me insane.  You might spend 20 - 30 minutes within a given area scouting, and trying to figure out the best course of action, only to be killed by a rogue soldier, and then you get to start from the beginning of the checkpoint, repeating all of the progress you've just made.  Craziness.  I found myself having to simply walk away from this game many times out of pure frustration, which I rarely do with any game.  I like games that steadily progress, but in this game, I found myself redoing scenes of play, over and over, until I completed each part exactly the way the designers of the game wanted me to.\n\nI would label this a very mediocre game, with a large portion of frustrating mechanics.  I would not wish this game on my worst enemy.  Do not even start playing this game if you value keeping your brain as a single solid mass, and not a skull full of  scrambled mush.","April 11, 2014","false","16.3"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","13","17","0","0"

The game is trial and error - you just have to wait long enough to figure out the movement patterns (most obvious in the pond - section where you have to cross the small bridge). The tasks are basically to kill two major dudes .... and all the minions that stand in your way to them. Story starts promising - but the end is abrupt and dissatisfying. For a game it is much too tedious and more wait and watch the patterns. Some sections of some chapters are well done - others again draw you out of the immersion because the npcs either walk on one point or they aren´t able to use the stairs, ladders, etc. and forget very fast that they just detected you (not always, but most of the time). Still it´s a good game. Game mechanics aren´t bad at all. Most of the story is ok and believeable. It gets very challenging if you really try to stealth-kill all of the npcs (except at the end....there´s no way you can stealth-kill those for sure). And don´t forget to grab all collectibles because you can improve your sneaking-speed, body armor and how give more damage to the enemy. I played it 17 hours (while about 3 hours was more playing around than following the quest). As a comparison: I finished Bioshock Infinite and the first "Burial at Sea" DLC and playing a little bit around with the "Clash in the Clouds" DLC 19 hours. Definitely get it (on sale or in a bundle)....even if you only play the first chapter...still a joy to watch and figure out how the enemies move.","October 27, 2014","true","17.0"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","1"

There is a leveling up system, but the only way to level up is to find collectibles throughout the game.  So if you don't find collectibles, you may never level up.

She was badly injured, prisoned and executed in the execution alley at Ravensbrueck, aged twenty-three, on or before 5 February 1945, by shooting in the back of the head by SS-Rottenfuehrer Schult, in the presence of camp commandant Fritz Suhren (who pronounced the death penalty), but more about her dramatic life you will learn from the game.\n\nGraphics - 9/10 (for 2009 game)\nAtmosphere - 9/10\nSound - 8/10\nStory - 9/10\nGameplay - 6/10\nControls - 7/10\nChallenge - 8/10\nOverall - 8/10\n\nBut anyway, if you are not enjoying Story based Deep Atmospheric games with hard/challenging gameplay, think you will not like it, but my recommendation is to play it fully and dive in story and realistic atmosphere of WWII and then judge.","April 10, 2014","true","14.5"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","1"

You can install it over your existing drivers. I had no problems running this on Windows 8.1.\n\nThe main sneaking mechanic is very basic. When your icon glows purple you can't be seen. When it doesn't, you're exposed. I wish there was some sort of fading system to this so I could tell when i'm pushing my limits of being in the shadows. It's an on/off switch.\n\nFYI, you cannot replay individual missions. Even after you beat the game. So if you are a collector and missed some items during a level, you better replay it from one of the checkpoints before progressing further.\n\nI had about 3 total crashes that just abruptly sent me back to the desktop. Enough to note but not to complain about.\n\nPros\n+Graphics style is nice.\n+Autosave system is fairly frequent.\n+Assassination animations are always satisfying.\n+Price. I got the game for 49 cents. Unbelievable deal!\n+Multiple ways of solving each mission.\n+No huge difficulty spike. It trends nicely.\n+Interesting and diverse enviornments\n+Smooth constant 60fps\n\nCons\n-Repetitive enemy noises and sayings\n-Morphine is a get out of jail free card\n-Forced to use guns toward the end of the game.\n-Sneaking system very basic\n-I never got into the plot.\n-You need to exploit the stealth mechanics and enemy AI a lot.\n-Pet peeve of spawned enemies occurs several times. Relies on some trial and error.\n-Addition of manual save for PC port would have been nice\n\nBottom Line\nStealth games are surprisingly relaxing for me to play. Sneak around, watch guard patterns and execute your moves. Velvet Assassin was what I expected. The core mechanics for a stealth game are here, but feel like a lot could have been improved.\n\nFinal Score\n6.5/10 - Good game.

Nothing wrong with autosave only, if they put checkpoints on the right places.\n- The AI is bad and without logic. The search mode especially is broken.\n- Kill animations are just boring\n- Its pretty linear. Theres too little room for creativity when "solving the puzzle". More gadgets, bigger rooms, more enemies, I say.\n- The parts where you actually need to use your gun are just terrible. Especially the very end of the game, they just didnt care anymore.\n- Occurring stutter\n- The game isnt that challenging, playing on the hardest difficulty.\n- Crashing quite often (probably just amd racism, like with the constant stuttering)\n\n\nI just dont know. The game is just badass and the way i like it, but if they gave it like 6 months more time to work on then it could have been so much better.

It has been a long time since I first finshed this game when it came out in 2009. Even till now this game is still one of the hardest steath game comparing with today's stealth games like Hitman or Spliter Cell. You are just a secret agent in world war 2 without fancy gadets or a special team to assist you. Hell you don't even have a radar or a proper arsenal. The best weapon that you are going to get is the good ol STG44 and by the time you get this it would be near the end of the game.\nPros:\n1. Gives you the purest stealth experience\n2.Retro gloomy WW2 atmosphere\n3.Who doesn't love to see a sexy agent stabbing nazies.\n4.Stunning graphic for a 2009 game.\n5.It is just a PRICE OF A COFFEE!!!!!!!\nCons\n1. CRUEL and Inhumane CHECKPOINT system.(You can't save manually in this game. Sometimes you have to play a really long time to reach the next checkpoint, and if you happen to get caught and get wasted then it would all be a waste of time= =)\n2.Some scenes are really unforgiving and difficult. Took me 30 tries to get out of the sewer :< and sometimes those nazies can see you from a mile away and once you are spotted you are basically dead meat or sitting ducks. So this game has decent AI.\n\nBtw some missions are designed to let you play the style of Call of duty(lots of ammo and medkits and lots of enemies)\nAnyway, i love this game except some flaws but meh I still recommend you to play it sometimes and if you are a hardcore fan of stealth games you can't miss it.","February 27","true","8.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

Well, that is acceptable.\n\nDuring a mission, you can also acquire a letter or listen to a conversation of two men, to know more information about the story well. One intersting way, worth of metion, to kill an enemy, is to pull the pin out of the grenade on him, and in a few of seconds, a surprising explosion kills him and others around him.\n\nThe graphic is okay I think.\nThe sound effect and music are acceptable as well.\n\nBut there are all I can tell the goods above.\n\nThe story is not that attractive. Most time, Unlike Hitman series, Velvet Assassin is like one-way route game, and you do not have many choices to decide how to pass this current situation. Of course, besides doing assassination, you can also confront enemies to gun them down, but in my opinion, shooting is the big problem of this game.\n\nImagine a well trained agent, good at sabotage behind enemies' line, but she is unable to accurately shoot well with a rifle or an StG44, not even in a still state. When it is mid-range, you have high chances missing lots of shots at enemies, needless to say about long range. That, as well as the vulnerable endurance, will become pain when players are doing the final stage.\n\nI would say Velvet Assassin is kind of like a lite version of Hitman, but it is far behind Hitman which can bring more fun to players.

She's a great character and her model is gorgeous, the soundscapes are great, the enemies actually speak German (it used to be rather uncommon a few years back that any character spoke their native tounge, unless it happened to be English), and the light effects are nice.\n\nBut the fact is, the game is punishingly difficult. Relying mostly on stealth tactics, the fist few episodes works fine to ease you into the games mechanics. You can even feel it is a bit too unbelievable that guards patrolling would spot you only to forget you were crawling into a vent or something a moment later, even for game logic. But then there's a difficulty spike that will have you ragequit the game after a number of failed attempts. It's not that you don't know what to do, it's how hard it is to actually do it in this game. Surely, some will find this challenging and truthful, I can appreciate the fact you don't survive bulletstorms for example, but damn...\n\nI review this game even though I never finished it. I simply couldn't do it. And I've finished other stealth games and shooters. I wanted to play it, I wanted to experience it first hand. And I stuck with "Tomb Raider: Angel of Darkness", getting help with one boss battle, and downloading one savefile, simply because I was determined to experience it!\n\nIf there ever came a patch for this 2009 game to make it easier, smoother and more forgiving, I would recommend it! But as it stands, it's more punishment than pleasure. And if there's no balance in that... It's just not enjoyable.","May 18, 2015","false","4.0"," 19 of 33 people (58%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","58","19","33","2","5"

You play as Violet, a secret agent who really likes stabbing nazis. The story isn't one of the game's strong suits and it doesn't need to be, because the stealth gameplay is quite good and is complemented by pretty well designed levels.\n\nThe challenge is really good as the AI can be quite nasty at times and any mistake will punish you. There's a variety of ways you can take out nazi scum and they're all equally satisfying, be it electricuting them, stabbing them in the balls, or pulling one's grenade pin and turning him into a walking time bomb unbeknownst to him and his buddies he's chatting with. There's even a little bit of Hitman-style stealth where you can sometimes put on an SS uniform as a disguise (which Violet looks quite cute in). For a game released in 2009 it looks quite nice, and comparable to titles released even six years later.\n\nThe game isn't without its flaws though, and they're pretty ugly ones, the worst being the save system being checkpoint-based. To me, checkpoints have no place in stealth games, and this one stinks on ice. Stealth is a genre where you're constantly in delicate situations, and one little mistake will just mess everything up. Having checkpoints be minutes apart is just abusive, and it's not helped by the ludicrous AI. I like a good challenge in my stealth, but it was often that the AI felt just downright ♥♥♥♥ing clairvoyant. If you spook a nazi, no matter how or where he'll just converge on your position. You can make a noise and sneak to the other side of the damn area and he'll keep following you, almost as if he just knows you're there. Another thing I think has no place in stealth games is forced action/shooting segments, and there's more than a handful present. The game really falls apart in the last stage because of this, as it's almost nothing but forced gunfights. There's also the occasional bug here and there but what modern game doesn't have those.\n\nThis game has been undeservedly neglected since its release six years ago. Despite its nasty flaws, there's a lot to like here, and it feels good to play a game that'll push my ♥♥♥♥ in for any mistake I make, especially in an age where stealth has fallen from grace and has been relegated to garbage pseudo-stealth you see in big-name games nowadays. Not to mention it's so damn cheap you'd be wrong not to give it a shot.\n\nHell, if it's too hard for you, you can even mess with config files and make it easy for your casual baby butt to handle.","December 25, 2015","true","10.2"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","8","12","0","0"

If you didn’t like the likes of Thief or the older Splinter Cell titles or need massive freedom in approaching your strategy like in Dishonored, Velvet Assassin will certainly not change your mind.\n\nThe title is very linear and the majority of time you spend crouching in shadowy corners, figuring out enemy patrol patterns and move slowly in for the kill, hoping you didn’t miss any observant Nazi in viewing or hearing distance. The enemy AI is not that good, they follow their patterns and investigate suspicious activities. Your hero Violette is not Solid Snake and there not many gadgets or weapons to be used, mainly it’s you, your knife and the shadows. The difficulty level is high and most of the time there is only one right way to get through a scenario. This means a lot of Trial & Error (and repetition due to a checkpoint system), but it makes success rewarding and the controls are precise enough to almost never make it frustrating. The almost comes from some forced action sequences that can get overwhelming too easily especially toward the end of the game.\n\nVelvet Assassin takes itself serious, there is no humor to be found, the world is dark and depressing, but at the same time beautifully presented. This is very fitting for the World War 2 setting that is relatively fresh for this kind of game. The narrative structure interesting, full of dark themes and delivered by solid voice actors, overall I would call the game emotionally engaging and that is one of the things that definitely make it worth playing, even though the gameplay doesn’t offer that much variety. The campaign is relatively short and things wrap up before they can get boring.\n\nI recommend Velvet Assassin to all stealth fans or gamers that are interested in a darker more personal World War 2 setting, definitely worth playing and the short campaign won’t take that much time to finish.\n\nPros:\n- emotionally engaging\n- solid stealth mechanics\n- good story in a beautiful setting\n\nCons:\n- linear (not much freedom) and short\n- frustrating forced shoot-outs","January 2, 2015","true","5.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thedanaaddams/recommended/16720/","thedanaaddams","TheDanaAddams","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thedanaaddams/","2641 products in account","So, in the '40s there was this little scuffle called World War II.\nAnd during this time, a woman named Violette Szabo joined the British Army.\nShe married a French soldier, worked a number of military positions, found out she was a bit pregnant and took some time off to give birth to her child, then went right back into duty.\nA few months after her little girl was born, her husband was killed in action.\n\nAnd that just ♥♥♥♥♥♥ her off.\n\nSeeking some Nazi-revenge, she accepted a field position, and went into Spec Ops.\nThe only thing she ever screwed up in training was a parachute landing. Once. Pulled it off just fine after she recovered from the sprained ankle.\nHer only weakness was that damn ankle.\nShe had a talent for dead-aim with a gun, sabotage, and undetected assassination.\n\nBasically she was a stone-cold Nazi-stopping machine, and one HELL of a spy.\n\nWhile heading to a mission, she got stopped by an unexpected road checkpoint, at which point an apparent firefight broke out. Her comrade got away, but she sprained the ankle again, and was captured after running out of bullets.\n\nShe was taken prisoner, and almost escaped from the camp, before being moved. Eventually her true identity was discovered, leading to her interrogation, and tragic execution.\n\nThis game is inspired by her.\n\nAnd I must assert INSPIRED BY, since it is not a telling of the Story of Violette Szabo, but a character based on her.\nA strong, intelligent, skilled woman working as an active spy, infiltrating Nazi territory and getting some hardcore Nazi-vengeance.\n\nIf you like badass female protagonists, just go ahead and get this game.\n\nIt should be noted that there are some questionable choices, like the highly sexualised, skimpy gown she wears in "Morphine Mode" and some pre-rendered pinup-style loading-screen images.\nAnd look, I'll forgive the pinup renders in general - it fits with the World War II theme... though it must be said that sexualising a hospitalised woman is incredibly problematic... but the Morphine Mode change felt mostly unnecessary.\n\nGet past that, though, and you're sneaking about in a solid WWII Stealth game, taking down Nazis from the shadows.\nYou do not get the ammo to shoot your way through, so you will rely on stealth executions. You have a very small health allowance, too, adding to the "no really, stealth is the way to go" factor.\n\nThis is NOT a "shoot 'em all" WWII Nazi-killing game.\nGo play Wolfenstein or something, if that's what you're after.\n\nOne of its shortcomings is the AI. Completely incapable, apparently, of thinking "hey, maybe that spy we were just chasing is on the other side of the door we just saw her run through!"\nThey have a very short memory, and attention-span.\nCertainly, the AI is the weakest part of the game, and breaks the immersion, but as the detection mechanics are pretty unforgiving, you'll probably be grateful that all it takes for them to forget about you is to hide behind a door, and watch through the keyhole as they go back to their post.\n\nOne particularly interesting element was its presentation of the Nazi soldiers. Often dehumanised, faceless, evil goons, here you get to see what a spy would have encountered - casual chatter: Feeling sorry for the drunk guy (you just killed) for his apparent alcoholism after the things he'd seen during the war. General complaining about when the replacement next shift will arrive. Arguments over who stole someone's chocolate.\nIt's an unusual thing to see Nazi soldiers humanised, and it really does add a lot to the atmosphere - they're normal human beings; when unaware of observation, they will behave as such. It's a simple thing, but it really adds to the feeling of being a spy; seeing things you wouldn't normally see, like your enemy being so normal - so casual.\n\nPerfect? No.\nGood? Totally.\nRecommended? Yes.","December 25, 2014","true","2.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Then this is the game for you\n\nThis game is a great third person action/stealth game with a fairly good combat system. The game is full of tense moments and tight confined spaces. You can approach almost every situation by either gunning down everything that breathes (you will die quickly) or you can sneak around in the shadows and strike decisively and killing indiscriminately before fading away leaving the remaining Nazi’s to wonder who you will butcher next. Also with the addition of Morphine mode you become indestructible and storm through everyone that stands in your way.\n\nThe story, based rather loosely on real life events, is sparse but enjoyable, not everything has to be massively in depth but here is enough going on to keep you interested and playing. It’s pretty standard for a world war two spy setting, your job is to defeat bag guys and gain intel. It does take place in retrospective, you see what’s going to happen but it’s the getting there that’s interesting. The characters themselves though are rather two dimensional to be honest, it’s hard to pin down why but I didn’t feel particularly connected to Violette, even when the story develops.\n\nPick this game up and enjoy the ride, especially if it’s on sale. The game has not aged amazingly and there were several glitches, none of which game breaking. However I had a good time with it right up to the end before the final mission changed everything. So as with a lot of games from this era I would recommend playing it but don’t feel the need to finish it.\n\nHave fun ^_^","May 13, 2014","true","10.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It is really focused on stealth. You only get a few bullets during each mossion, and if you choose to use them, then you better aim well and keep in mind that all the nearby enemies will hear your shot. And you will not have enough bullets for everyone. And sometimes just 1 bullet from an enemy kills your player. This makes you rely more on stealth kills and forces you to plan your approach. There's no running and gunning here.\n\nSo as long as you know what you're getting into with this game, you'll be rewarded. I picked it up on sale, and I'm really glad that I gave it a chance.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dronak/recommended/16720/","dronak","Dronak","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dronak/","2192 products in account","I tried this game thinking it would be interesting.  I liked the two sniper games I played recently, and although this is a different type of game, I thought it would be good, too.  I understand that stealth-based games tend to be difficult, but I think this one is excessively hard.  Even on the easier difficulty level, after ~30 minutes of playing and making multiple attempts, I was still unable to pass the first pair of guards.  Killing the first was easy, but I couldn't get past the second after that.  I expect the beginning of a game like this basically to be instructions on how the game works and what you'll need to do throughout the game.  The start should be relatively easy.  Here, it's not.  There's little instruction besides wait for the two guards to separate (which is semi-obvious), and you're pretty much on your own to figure out how to pass the second guard after taking out the first, something I wasn't able to do.  Had this happened later in the game, I'd accept it as a tricky part of a stage, but having this happen right in the beginning of the game is extremely frustrating.  Maybe I'll come back to this some day, but for now I've uninstalled it.  It's hard to get into a game when I can't even pass the beginning section without massive difficulty.  More dedicated players or people who like stealth games might enjoy this.  But given what I see as excessive difficulty right in the beginning of the game, I can't really recommend this.\n\nUpdate:  Thanks to a comment on this review, I finally passed the intro mission and got to the next one.  However, I still don't really like that the intro wasn't a self-walkthrough, and I'm still finding the game overall to be slow-moving and rather difficult, even very early on.  That's probably the point here, but I'm not really enjoying it.  Every time I die at a harder part, I have to redo the easier parts before it, and this happens over and over again, making things feel repetitive.  Also, in some sniper games I played recently, I felt like I had a fighting chance if I got spotted, but here I feel like I'm just dead meat.  Maybe this isn't my type of game.  Perhaps in small doses, it will be OK, but I think I'll just end up frustrated if I try to play this for a long time at once.  As I said originally, if you like this type of game in general, you'll probably like this specific game, but I don't think it's for me, and for more casual gamers like me, I wouldn't recommend it because of the rather high difficulty level it seems to have.","July 20, 2014","false","1.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","3"

Inspired by the actual WWII british agent Violette Szabo only adds to this gameplay element (being able to relate to a real world element in video games is cool to boot).  As you play through Velvet Assassin, you get to relive all of Violette Summers missions as she remembers them.  You also get a wide array of different weapons at your disposal which also includes "Morphine" Mode that is a ability to slow down time and either get a free kill or utilize it to ensure a more successful escape from soldiers.  At times NPC dialogue can interfere with moving forward and Violette at times can be overwhelmed easy then die but you can level up 3 different stats along the way : Morphine, Stealth and Strength (from acquiring collectables and completing secret objectives during the missions).  All in all, Velvet Assassin is fun and worth the purchase! 8/10","February 20","true","62.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

The game was surprising. I say if you can pick it up for $5 or less, it is a hell of a deal, if you like Spy/stealth games.\n\nThe game has wonderful music, and the atmosphere is heavy, and the graphics aren't bad at all, lighting is great.  Gunplay leaves a bit to be desired, but the game does not focus on that aspect.  Story is ok, though not its strong suit.  AI is dynamic, meaning that sometimes the AI really shines, and other times its as dumb as a rock.\n\nThe atmosphere was nice though, creeping around WWII as a stealth assassin, and I am usually WWII'd out.\n\nIf they made a sequel I would be happy to get it, on sale of course.\nI recommend this game if you can get it on sale, it really was very entertaining, and rather engaging!","December 8, 2011","true","0.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","1"

The mood of this game is what one would truly expect of war-torn Europe; bleak, fearful, violent and sad.  The opening movie pretty much sums the game up in my opinion, not to spoil it for anyone but it reminds me of that eerie opening to one of my favourite TV series; The World at War were humanity is destroying itself in an unforgiving darkened world.\n\nNow your role as Violette is to infiltrate and end the lives of the darkest and most corrupt seeds in the Third Reich (well you blow stuff up too) in quick and quiet fashion then escape - no charging about like Master Chief, you're an assassin not god with a gun and a green suit because believe me this game can be unforgiving when caught.  Now I very much recommend a Xbox controller or something similar when play this game as the controls are very clunky even on controller, especially when shooting.  The visuals and sound are very satisfying and in-sync with the mood; sombre and eerie would be my quick description.  There is one mechanic that does stand out however and that is the morphine power, to put it simply when injected you enter a slow down mode where you can damn near do anything which does kill the immersion somewhat.  The A.I aren't too bright in the game either, then not many games pull that off but they are not without character.  They have seen war and it has touched them deeply and some of the conversations you hear are truly horrific.\n\nNow this game is certainly not for everyone, but to anyone like me who plays stealthy characters in any game with the option to do so will feel right at home with this game.  You choose the right weapons for your mission, disguise yourself when necessary and gather intelligence when and if you can.\n\nI would give this game a 4/5 for it truly is an enjoyable game with a few flaws.","December 28, 2013","true","10.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I probably enjoyed it more than I should but still, there are few reasons for negative review. Mostly because of stealth: It's much better than more popular "stealth" games but still not a perfect one. You will fail many times because enemy will notice you when they shouldn't. Parts of game when you need to change into SS uniform are most annoying. And last mission... it changes to shooter game. Level designs aren't also good. Running around because there are parts in this game where locations looks almost same. Fortunately there is a map, so you will need to look at it many times. And a things like "finding a key for this door which is behind a door WHICH also needs a key" is kinda ridiculous. I don't remember if it was main part of game or maybe for some collectibles but still...\nGraphics are nice, Violette looks even more nice, german soldiers speaks their native which makes experience while playing even better. BUT if main mechanism of game isn't so good, then it all doesn't matter. If there will be some sale for this game, I guess it's worth at least checking.

Velvet Assassin is a direct port from the Xbox 360 version. It is depressing to see how little effort they put into the pc port. $4.99 is a rip off for the game. The stealth isn't close to being true stealth, the controls are very clunky, and the AI deserves a facepalm. I have actually played ring around the rosey with the soldiers and it is impossible to kill them face forward. I have seen bad games but unlike others this had some potential in it. Oh ya, I almost forgot but when i said the controls were clunky i mean you can't use your god damn mouse in the menus or anything else except for controlling your camera. Sounds insane? Yes, it is outragous and your character moves like if it was pacman. The gunplay is hilariously bad and don't trust the reviews they are probably fake accounts which the developer made.

First time in a decade I see something original like it, and an interesting main character is hard to come by these days. Sad, sinister, cold? Allegory? If war is hell, then Violette might be burning. The gameplay was clumky sometimes and not very realistic (say, like Splinter Cell and its crazy shadow play) but its so mature that you realize how good it is after a while. Lot's of passion was invested on that game I can tell, they gave it lots of well-made details for such little resources and we can all see that clearly. It's a game who obviously depends on its heavy atmosphere and good plot to be spinning. The big question is, how did I missed it back 2007? How did you missed it?

I’m not sure why I went with the unneeded alliteration but I’m not sure why the developers went with velvet. Maybe they were trying to turn Violet into velvet for some reason but…whatever…\n\nVelvet Assassin takes places in the early/mid 1940s. You’re a British assassin named Violette Summer who’s based off, in first name, hairstyle, and background only, of real world British assassin Violette Szabo[en.wikipedia.org]. Violette single handedly either takes out several high ranking Nazi leaders (who didn’t exist) or helped lead to the destruction of several Nazi outposts including the real-life mission Operation Gomorrah[en.wikipedia.org]. She does this with her well placed knife and a Nazi jugular vein. She also uses a silenced pistol but …ugh. More on this unfortunate mechanic later.\n\nStealth is both very good and very bad at the same time. Apparently, Nazi’s were very blind individuals. A light shade in otherwise broad daylight can keep them from noticing you. It seems odd that any darkness can be that good in a, mostly, realistic stealth game. The game does have a higher difficulty so if you want to skip the, “Does Violette have special shadow moving powers?” go ahead play that. I hear it’s painfully real. The game also has ‘Morphine Mode’, which allows you to travel unnoticed or get a face to face kill cam. It might seem like a supernatural power but you learn the first 10 missions are all flashbacks so morphine mode is a foggy memory of how Violette got that kill. The final two are “current time” missions.\n\nAs you go through missions you find collectables and hidden achievements (found through exploration) which, when you reach 1000 exp, allows you to upgrade a stat, either morphine mode; which increases syringe count and length, stealth; which allows you move faster, or strength; which makes you tankier. The collectables are various war medals and paraphernalia, some of which have interesting back stores but I feel like there could have been expanded to allow for more backstory. You might start feeling sympathy for Nazis through. There’s a few instances where the horrors of war appear all too human and you feel a little guilty as poor Gretchen won’t be seeing her husband because of you. They may be literal Nazi’s but they still dream and love like the good ol’ boys in [insert country flag colors here]. That’s one of the things the game does really well. The carnage of WWII is evident in every aspect of the game. Dead bodies litter the streets of Warsaw, Poland. Several children are apart of the body count as they hang in various trees in France. Some enemies are even given a soul when they wish none of this has happened and just want to go back home; not everyone follows the leader in war. There’s even one letter where the writer says he’s ready to die due to the nightmare reality.\n\nVA has 12 missions which average out an hour of play time (not sure if time resets on death). Checkpoints are all over the place but getting to them can be very painful. The slowness of the game is apparent when you have to kill a large amount of enemies in a less than straight forward way where you get caught, die and have to try again. Missions like level 6 might be a game killer if you’re not dedicated. The first 10 levels are wonderful, albeit a crawl at times. “Realistic” stealth mechanics where hiding in the shadows, behind a crate, or disguised as the only female SS officer in the game are the way to victory as there’s not enough ammo to go Rambo. That all changes in the last two levels and therein is where the game devolves into pain.\n\nYou see, Velvet Assassin stops being about stealth and turns into a third person shooter. This would be fine but the shooting aspects are very poor. The crosshair is there but bullets don’t always go where you’d think, enemies can be randomly resistant to damage, and general aim abilities are just awful. You know how many games have ice levels and you don’t stop when you want to stop? That’s what aiming in this game feels like. If you move a little, it doesn’t move but if you move a lot you just turned 360 degrees while barely trying. This can be mitigated by using a mouse but even then it needs a lot of work. To exacerbate the terrible aiming, the stealth mechanic goes away. Enemies are suddenly more likely to see you, even in deep shadows and getting enemies alone where you can get a knife skill is nearly impossible and it comes from nowhere. You can get through all but one or two levels in the first 10 without shooting anyone but suddenly it’s the only way to progress.\n\nAlong with the sudden genre shift, the developers tried to add some sex to the game. Violette stops wearing jackets and black ‘armor’ and now dons only a white negligée (and the velvet in Velvet Assassin) due to story reasons. She’s also very shiny for, uh, ‘plot’. It turns a hardnosed female assassin into a male fetish. There’s no option to get dressed and even in the credit epilogue she’s in her underwear. It’s like the last two levels were done by a different team. The game could have been great but due to the ending levels, it turns itself into mediocre at best.\n\nAs for non-gameplay aspects: Voice acting it nice. Our Heroine sounds smooth and pleasant and at no point do you ever wish for her to shut-up. Maybe it’s the English accent (from a New York born, German for five years raised woman) or the lower tones but I’d like to hear Melinda Y. Cohen[en.wikipedia.org] more often.\nThe German enemies spoke German (with subtitles if you don’t speak the language) so there’s some immersion for ya.\nMusic is…eh. You hear the sound of gunfire too often and in places where you shouldn’t be hearing gunfire. It can also throw you off and make you think someone saw you. Otherwise, it’s all atmospheric. It ramps up when you’ve been spotted and it always makes me feel like I screwed-up when I hear it. Not sure if that was the purpose but that’s the outcome so, to be honest, I’m digging it. There are no official sources so here’s some Youtube videos. There’s actually more tracks than I thought and there’s less than one page in the link.\n\nThe art helps contribute perfectly to the doom and gloom of war. There are no vibrant colors and blue skies are replaced by a dark, dirty, orange. There aren’t even any stars in the sky. Everything else is stone, iron, and ground. No hope, no freedom, no future. Welcome to war. That being said, the Paris skyline from the river Seine (or what I think is the river) circa 1943 looks beautiful even in high overcast and fog.\n\nThe game has its sufferable flaws but for .49 USD cents which is what I paid for it during a summer sale (so the price of 8-16 cards), it’s well worth it. It’s a slow plough through the first 10 levels (which is what to expect from a stealth game) and the third person shooting genre change makes the game way less fun so at full price, don’t buy it; it’s not worth it. I really wish I could recommend at full price but my frustrations at needing to relearn the game 5/6ths of the way in makes It hard.

What does it make me think about? Well, lots of things. Both good and bad. The game really is not very well made, but that's not what it is trying to be. It has some nice touches here and there that come off as very cool. There are moments when things come off just right and you think to yourself, "If only it was like that always."\n\nThere are things in this game that are just down right stupid. For example, I killed three guards outside of a building and just left them there in the open. I go inside the building and change into a disguise, then proceed back outside just to find all the bodies are gone and there are new guards standing there talking.\n\nI am able to deal with almost anything if the story is compelling. Come to mention it, the story for this game only goes as deep as you want it to. You play as a killer, who knows that's her job and is on a deathbed remembering all the horrible things she did. I enjoyed the fact that it was all over the place, even if it was bad writing. It wasn't trying to shove some point down my throat and ended up almost being a surreal experience more so than a coherent one.\n\nNow, do keep in mind this is a very ugly game, with poor AI and too many annoying events that will take place. Still, I enjoy playing it in short bursts whenever I want to get and old-school vibe. I know this is for 2009, still when I play it I remember why I loved Hitman and Tenchu when they first came out. This is not anywhere near as good, but it is like a fever dream from those days. Something I tend to find myself trapped in, then before I know it I want to get back to where it's peaceful. This is that nightmare you might enjoy for a moment, until it's just too terrible to deal with.\n\nSo, sitback, get ready to rage and think of it like a Mars Bar.","August 16, 2014","true","3.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Mind you, if you're spotted, they are above-average shots and will swarm upon you. In these scenarios, you can either shoot back -- with gun-play that doesn't operate well, outside of sneaking head-shots -- or hide -- enemies stay in their zones, you can identify zones by the doors that you can enter but have no opening animation --.\n\nThere are three skills to level up, to help you along as you play. You gain experience by completing secret side-missions and by picking up collectibles. While you will not gain experience for most of your kills, sometimes a collectible can be found when searching the bodies of your fallen enemies.\n\nThe one unique feature of this stealth game is the "Morphine" item. Upon use, time will stop momentarily, giving you the opportunity to run away/past a tricky situation, or silently kill an enemy head-on. It can be a saving grace when backed into a corner, but you also might forget that the item is even there.\n\nGame-play becomes very repetitive, quickly. To keep the game fresh, I can not play more than 1 or 2 missions in a session. Which is a shame, but with a bargain asking price of $5 or less, it's hard to regret this purchase.\n\nOver-all, I'd give it a grade of C+.","May 23, 2015","true","8.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

If you can forgive some functional issues (enemy-proof doors, sparse checkpoints, poorly explained interface), you’re in for a well-written adventure on the macro scale and thoughtfully crafted, varied stealth gameplay on the micro scale.\n\nPros and cons:\n\n+ You have a variety of tools at your disposal.  You can sneak up and backstab a guard, or pull the pin on his grenade if he has one.  You can use one of your very scarce bullets, or use an environmental hazard like electrified water or poison gas barrels.  You can take a shot of morphine and charge an enemy before he can react.  You can stay in the shadows, break a fuse box to darken new areas, or hide in tall plants when outside.  You can also peek through keyholes before you enter a room, and whistle to draw the enemy away from his normal patrol route.\n+ The game looks good, and the art supports the gameplay.  Strong shadows make it clear whether you’re hidden in the dark or not.  The enemies don’t look like clones of each other, which helps you keep count of everyone when sizing up a room.\n+ The story ties things together well.  A large part of the game is presented as the protagonist recounting her adventures.  So she says things like “I had to find a key” which sounds better than her talking to herself in the present.  A major plot point is foreshadowed bit by by bit through flash-forwards.  The enemy guards frequently have long conversations with each other which, along with the collectible treasures, enrich the experience and sound very authentic.\n\n- About half of the doors seem to load a different section of the map.  Enemies can’t follow you through these doors.  So no matter how hot things get, if you can reach a ‘load’ door you’re totally safe.\n- The game only saves at checkpoints, which are often annoyingly far apart.  Most enemy encounters have one of two outcomes: you execute your plan perfectly, or you die and start over.  There’s not much middle ground, so even with upgraded health, most of the medkits go unused.\n- While the game isn’t totally linear, player movement is tightly controlled.  You can only crawl, jump, or climb at specific places where the game allows it.  Invisible walls insure you can never step off a ledge, or even wade through a foot-deep pond.  So basically, don’t expect ‘outside the box’ thinking to get you anywhere.\n- Some of the interface and instructions are confusing.  For example, you don’t use ‘aiming mode’ to backstab somebody.  Even though you raise your knife and it looks like exactly what you’re supposed to do, you’ll clumsily poke the guard, and almost certainly get shot before he dies.  You *can* get more than one morphine needle, but you need to upgrade your morphine multiple times.  There are things like this that weren’t communicated well, which you’ll have to figure out through trial and error.","May 21, 2015","true","18.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You are Violette, a British female spy who attempts to weaken Nazi Germany in World War II.\n\nThe game employs a stealth-based gameplay-style characterised by the following things:\n\n--shadows are your best friend and you can hide without soldiers being able to see you\n--this is a must - once you are seen it is difficult to survive the firefight\n--you have morphine syringes at your disposal: once you use these the game becomes slow-mo and you can easily eliminate the guards who have noticed you; you need to look for these syringes as you can quickly run out of "ammo"\n--wearing a disguise: Violette can pick up an SS uniform which means you can move freely amongst the German soldiers; you cannot get too close to them and you need to be careful as to what action you perform\n\nViolette receives experience points which allow you to upgrade her skills. This is just a minor RPG element and to be honest nothing unusual or exciting. Also, the more collectibles you find the more XP you can collect - it's worth looking around wherever you go on each level.\n\nThe game is OK for its price, especially if discounted (the last time it cost 0.99 EUR). Stealth mechanics are not the best and what I never understood is that if a game wants you to go stealth why does it employ a level which is based on combat? The last level is all about combat and it is very tedious. Putting this one aside the story of Violette seems interesting and the game's art design is quite good along with the music and the German voice acting.\n\nIf you do not have any particular game in mind and are looking for a good discounted software Velvet Assassin should be your pick.","April 8, 2014","true","9.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Violet is beautifully designed and I'll be glad to follow her on more adventures, as the game's 10-15 hours of gameplay aren't quite enough to squeeze all the WWII possible missions, and it's a shame that there aren't different possible outcomes at the end of each chapter, specially during the final one, no matter how fast you play there is no way to save the village from it's tragic fire.","February 16, 2014","true","16.9"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

The game mechanic is simple, going from point A to B to finish level, sneaky or loud depend on you. Sure, the game itself is completely linear which I dont mind being as stealth game.\nStealth is so simple. get behind enemy and assassinate, hide body and shadow is your friend all the time.\n\nThe game surely has potential and very good setup as British spy in deep dark WWII atmosphere. However, the huge downgrade is enemy AI which they can become frustrating. The can spot you from blind spot, spawn from nowhere or notifiaction for player, or even worse. When they alert or found body (you're not spotted). they can locate player position even I hide in the shadow. It's totally non-sense and doesn't feel like playing cat and mouse stealth. Many times, player is forced to fight back or run to previous section to reset AI tracking. Combine with narrow and linear path which force player to do this or pattern which developers just set. No various path to give player choice of stealth. Even, the morphine system is clearly proof that some section force you to use this or run to checkpoint. (The game also has collectable and it force you to become risky rambo too if you want to collect them.)\n\nI found myself have fun and frustrating moments in the game. The story has good setup with flashblack, but totally lose its interesting in the end. Overall, Velvet Assassin is just a decent game, if you dont mind about broken AI and lack of freedom, you may find something fun.","August 27, 2014","false","12.4"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","2"

For one thing it was based in part on true historical events, looked to have a strong female protagonist, and in my book anytime you can fight Nazi baddies... Well, it's a good time! I had the game on my radar for quite sometime, read both good and bad reviews on it, and figured what the heck when Stream put it on a blowout summer sale... How could I possibility go wrong?\n\nSecond, let me make this perfectly clear. I'm not a "troll, hater", or a negative person in anyway. However, at this very moment what I am is vexed. After waiting for over an hour for the game to download, I hit the play button and was instructed to configure the game's settings. I did so, and was met with a frozen screen and a "critical error" pop-up box. Okay, I thought... I'll just reboot the computer and try again... Three more tries later equaling three more crashes, and some sleuthing, I came to find out that in order to play Velvet Assassin, I more than likely have to alter my drives... I run much older games on my system, as well as newer games, and see no reason why I should have to take such measures with this one...\n\nIn short, I really want to play this game and hope that there is a better fix out there then having to alter my system. I would really like to reverse this review at some point.  If anyone has a better suggestion please feel free message me.  :)","June 26, 2014","false","0.6"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

Ammo for the few weapons you find in the levels is rare, but since the shooting mechanics are horrible that doesn't even matter anyway.\n\nMoving through the levels without being spotted requires a certain amount of tactics and timing, but luckily, by whistling, you can lure enemies into dark places to take them out silently with a variety of brutal takedown animations.\n\nThe biggest drawback of the game is the save system. With no manual saves, you have to rely on the rarely placed checkpoints, which - due the nature of the game - can be a very tedious and frustrating task, especially when going for an unarmed full-stealth playthrough.\n\nVA is a game you *can* get, but you certainly won't miss out on anything if you don't.","April 2, 2012","true","12.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I wasn't sure is this a good idea but it's so cheap so why not.\nWell, I really like stealth games and Velvet Assassin is a big suprise for me. It's very underestimated game !\nThe main character is a young woman Violette Summer who is a special british agent during World War II. Her story is based on fates of real spy Violette Szabo.\nAs a spy, we must of course crouch a lot, kill our enemies in a best way we can do or we can just leave them alone and focus on our mission but it's not so easy so I prefer to kill them. Our best friend is Violette's knife, but sometimes we can find a gun and some ammo. These things are not the only things we can do. If we want to avoid light, we can break a bulb or even shoot at it. If we want to explore the level, we can find some interesting info like letters or something..we can also find a collectibles which give us more experience and if we get enough EXP Points, we are getting a 1 point so we can make Violette stronger (I am feeling like in RPG game ;)).\nThe graphics in game is not so bad, it looks nice on full details. Game's soundtrack is also nice, it's very atmospheric, it fits to the game, as I said I am really suprised this game is so good, it's not perfect but it's still good.\nThat all and many more this game can offer You. You should check this out, especially now when the price is so small.\n8,5/10","April 11, 2014","true","3.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Otherwise, would've been a waste.\n\nThis game doesn't feel like a game, more like trying to figure out all the controls for yourself. You can't even get out your gun for your life, nevermind assasinations with guns.\n\nThe storyline is horrible. The entire story is based off of some flashbacks while someone's on a hospital bed, and it isn't even that intruiging.\n\nThe only good thing I noticed about the game was the voice-acting and the artwork. But even that is mediocore. The rest is either pure ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t or it's so dull that I haven't even noticed it.\n\nThis game is based off of being an assassin. This game also wants you to blow up people and burn them alive. This game also gave you a shotgun, but decided not to give you silenced weapons.\n\nThe guards can notice everything but they ignore everything. A simple rule of thumb in this game is that if you crouch, they will not see you if you're far away. It's simple as that.\n\nThe various bugs in this game makes me cry. It ruins the game so bad that I can't even touch it without being reminded of the horrible bugs throughout the game.\n\n\n\nA good game concept and idea, but horribly misused by the creators of the game.","November 21, 2014","false","0.2"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thegamerwalkthroughs/recommended/16720/","thegamerwalkthroughs","TGW Cam","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thegamerwalkthroughs/","496 products in account","In the veins of Hitman (and I mean close enough that 47 would feel uncomfortable) lies this hidden little game. To my knowledge the company that made this shortly closed after the game's release, which is a shame because they could've patched this to be a great game or have worked on a sequel which wouldn't contain the same problems this faces.\n\nLet's start with the obvious, shall we? The stealth mechanics in this game are a massive pain in the backside offering large amounts of frustration and jankyness. Guards that have the inexplicable ability to see around corners, their seemingly amazing eyesight from several hundred metres armed with sub-machine guns that act more like sniper rifles and the fact your silenced pistol will be completely useless the majority of the time add to a VERY perplexingly bad disguise system (Worse than the Hitman: Absolution one) makes this incredibly annoying.\n\nThe level design is often vague and poorly chosen too. Very few times will you fairly have a chance to avoid the Nazis patrolling around and instead have to pick several of them off one by one until the majority have been thrown off a cliff with a knife lodged somewhere in their neck. This leads to ENDLESS amounts of restarts because somehow you were spotted around a corner lodged in a bush and naturally, you can't survive more than a handfull of bullets. Even when things do go your way, checkpoints are few and far between and often after SEVERAL incredibly difficult scenarios in which you'll be beggining for a break.\n\nThe amount of content itself is nice though, you have a decent amount of levels often taking more than 20 minutes to complete in a good run, accompanied by collectibles (if that's your thing). The morphine feature is incredibly useful too. It stops time (removing your clothes too?) and allows you to have a clear escape from the people about to turn you into a bullet-ridden english woman.\n\nAll in all, I honestly wouldn't recommend this to anyone who's not INTENSELY desperate for a stealth game when the Hitman Franchise, Splinter Cell (minus Conviction and Double Agent) and Alien Isolation exist. Go elsewhere for your sneaky stabby fix.","November 29, 2014","false","7.6"," 13 of 27 people (48%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","48","13","27","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/powyz/recommended/16720/","powyz","Fangu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/powyz/","197 products in account","Stealth game where stealth is almost completely broken.\nGame mostly consists of sneaking behind nazi soldiers and performing stealth kills. However, to perform a stealth kill you must stand still, if you walk, you cannot perform a kill. So it's a pain in the ♥♥♥ to perform stealth kills to walking soldiers, because you sneak very slowly and if you catch up to them, you must stop moving, because game doesn't let you to perform a kill while moving. And when you stop, most of the time guards walk too far away from you, so you have to chase them again. So you are chasing after soldiers and spamming LMB hoping you will be able to perform a kill. And when guards stop, they stand for maybe 1 or 2 seconds and they turn around and move again.\nWhistling is almost useless. If you whistle to attract attention, guards always come to your position. You can whistle and quickly relocate to different position, it doesn't matter, guard  will still come to where you are. And if you are whistling when being in a disguise, the guards won't react at all. Yes, if you are dressed up as a nazi soldier, guards won't react to whistling at all, even though they can't see who's whistling. Quite funny.\nDisguise system is a joke. Firstly, you can only change disguises when being inside wardrobes or toilets. In a disguise you cannot sneak, because all disguises have high heel shoes, which "make noise" and if you get too close to an enemy he will recognize you just from the sound, even if he is looking the other way. When you are in disguise, white line will appear showing how suspiciuos you are (the longer it is, the less suspicious you are). But it only reacts to the distance you are from the enemies or if you are crouching. Guards could be looking the other way, still they will suspect you if you crouch or if you get too close to them, even though they can't see you. So it is impossible to perform stealth kills with a disguise. It's funny how guard can recognize an imposter just from hearing the footsteps... So when wearing a disguise, you have to keep 50 meter distance from every soldier, even from those who can't see you or else your cover will be blown.\nEnemy's melee attack does more damage than their bullets. Also enemies move in a weird way when they are being suspicious. They turn by 90 degrees without any animations, and they turn their bodies first, and their heads later. Reminds me of Robocop. And most of the time when a guard is suspicious, he will look and point his gun at you even though he can't see you and don't know where you are.\nAlso, at the end of some levels when you blow something up, game throws at you terrible getaway sections. You are given about 1 minute to get to the end of the level and game throws some guards at you and you have to shoot your way through.\nAt least graphics are nice. Lighting looks good, i also like the brown atmosphere in some levels. Some textures look terrible, but overall graphics are OK. Visuals are no doubt the best thing in this game.\nVoice acting is also good. Voice actress of main character does a good job. Enemies speak german which is a good thing because it makes you feel like you are really fighting nazis instead of some guys who pretend to be nazis by speaking english with their fake "german" accent.\nAlso i have to give this game credit - it stays true to stealth genre (most of the time). You cannot just shoot every soldier in the game if you get bored from sneaking because main character cannot take damage and dies very fast and also you don't get many bullets. Usually you start a level with maybe 1 or 2 clips for your handgun and there are just a few weapon and ammo pickups (1~3) in a single level. Which is good for a stealth game, but it's a bad thing for Velvet Assassin, because stealth mechanics in this game are badly executed and because of that sometimes you want to abandon stealth and just shoot everyone.\nCheckpoints - they are very far away which is a terrible thing. Main character dies very fast (which is a good thing, stealth game after all with female protagonist), but very often you die not because of your own fault, but because of bad game mechanics (i've talked about them earlier). Imagine if the last soldier in the area kills you because you cannot perform a stealth kill while walking 10 cm behind him. And you have to start all over again. And the game is very linear, it doesn't give you any freedom, so when you restart the checkpoint you slowly play exactly the same way you did earlier.\nThis game is frustrating, terribly executed and most of the time you fight game mechanics instead of the enemies. It's a shame, since it had some good ideas. Sure, the game looks good, visuals are great and it creates nice atmosphere, but the gameplay is so frustrating. And no, it's not complete trainwreck like Ride To Hell or Garry's Incident, it's not 1/10 or 2/10 game, it's not filled with bugs, you dont fall through floors, enemies do not teleport or anything like that. But it's just that stealth is so badly executed. And it's a stealth game.\nHowever the price is very low right now. For 0.74 - sure, get it. It's almost nothing anyway. But for 4.99 you can get much better games like Sleeping Dogs, Mafia 2 or Hitman Absolution when they get discounted (and they get discounted very often).","March 17, 2014","false","6.0"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","7"

Running dual Nvidia 8800GTX caused my computer to blue screen on 1920x1080 resolution. Was finally able to stabilize it by running 1280x720.\n\nThis game is a very poor Splinter Cell clone. You will not find any of the great Splinter Cell features in this game. The weak story and cut scenes are the only things it has going for it and maybe the fact that it is controller enabled.\n\nKilling nazis is always fun, but there is no climbing on boxes, you can't hug walls, AI always seems to be setup in the right direction for you to sneak up and kill them removing any challenge, doors squeak, but AI is not alerted and even if you are spotted you can go back through the door and they won't follow.

It's like that one time, when that ok looking girl asked you to Sadie Hawkins, and you were excited to go, but not exactly with her. I mean, you had some fun, she gave amazing head and all, but the overall experience wasn't all that.\n\nHere, the game itself is pretty buggy; the stealth is...*quite* difficult(ie: no hand-holding); the overall concept is...kinda douchey(I mean, they basically wiki'd for a female operative in WW2, created some bs mechanic revolving around her in a nighty, and voila, game)...\n\nSo yea, it's not bad and it's not great. If you can find it for $0.75, then buy it(I did). Just make sure to read the forum, otherwise you won't even be able to launch it on most systems...\n\nPS: Steam won't let me vote sideways, so I'm going to give this a thumbsdown because if I HAD to give it a numerical rating it would be in the ~55% range, which to me, is below mediocre.","November 1, 2014","false","0.5"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

There are games which do this reasonably well. Not this one. You'll find yourself mechanically go through the same bunch of enemies over and over, just to get back to where you slipped up before.\n\nThere are scripted shootout sections, where you will be seen no matter what.\n\nGetting XP through "exploration" does not feel right. Why on earth does the heroine get better abilities by finding lighters and signet rings? Even so, you do not unlock new abilities, merely make the existing ones slightly better.\n\nOh, and your morphine-based abilities are going to get disabled for the most difficult last missions of the game. Hope you had fun upgrading those.\n\nThe level design, objectives and AI behaviour break immersion constantly. Enemies do not go for cover when shot at, they keep walking at your position. There is a fairly difficult mission where the primary objective is to retrieve weapons. You have to play using your knife only. You take great pains to dispatch ~ 20 enemies with it, each fully armed, but cannot pick up their waepons. You then arrive at a shed with the weapons your objective wants you to pick up. Of course they're the same type of weapons your enemies had on them all the time.\n\nThere is no story to speak of, and the ending is an insult to the player's intelligence.\n\nIf you're a die hard stealth game fan, give it a shot. Just don't expect much. It's not even comparable to stealth titles like Thief, Metal Gear Solid or Splinter Cell.\n\n\n\n","January 2, 2015","false","20.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

It can be frustrating.\n\nEDIT:\n\nafter few more hours into the game, I gotta say I CANNOT HANDLE IT ANYMORE.\n\nthis game is not a very bad stealth game, however it has serious design flaw that makes it unappealing over time.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/taebae/recommended/16720/","taebae","YUI","http://steamcommunity.com/id/taebae/","659 products in account","This game is about a British Agent who fell into a coma state after being shot while completing a mission.  During her time at the hospital, she has flashbacks of all her previous missions where she sabotages German plans in WWII (you play those missions).  After all the flashbacks, she wakes up and has to escape because Germans are looking for her and get back home.\n\nI think I got this from a bundle by IndieGala.\n\nAs a serial pervert I loved this game because:\n1. Main protagonist is hot.\n2. There are missions where you strut around in a military uniform and that fulfills my fetish desires\n3.  She also struts around in a nightgown/underwear in a few levels or when she takes morphine\n4.  She wears spandex in a few levels too.  If you look carefully, you can see traces of her underwear too.\n5. When she wears her nightgown, the bottom portion of it is see through, and you can see her crotch slightly.\n\nWhat this game needs to improve on:\n1. Adult scenes\n2. Undercover missions where the main has to pretend to be a sex slave.\n\nJokes aside (or really?), check the forums and download the patch if the game won't load.  This game plays like metal gear solid or splinter cell but don't expect that kind of game.  I played the game thinking it was more of an indie game than big company stuff and I thought it was really nice.  The AI is unpredictable in stupid ways and it can turn people off.  Sometimes they are blind as a bat - you kill his teammate next to him but in the shade and he can't see it but sometimes you stand in the shade and they detect you.  Also, the last 2-3 missions are significantly harder.  The game auto saves only and sometimes between checkpoints there are a lot of things that you have to repeat doing if you die.  One thing about this game is the linear pathing (can't skip mobs) and it is meant to be played stealth most of the time rather than brute force because of the ammo/disadvantage situations you are in.  I thoroghly enjoyed the game though as you can see the hours played (no I did not leave the game open and afk'd).","June 30, 2015","true","24.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

I've played this game multiple times and I can't get over the fact that I must be playing a differeent game than what is being reviewed by others.  I find the stealth tactics to be EXTREMELY satisfyiing in Velvet Assassin.  I found the storyline to be EXTREMELY interesting and I had a lot of compassion for her knowing it was based on a true person!  This is more of an action game in the genre of Splinter Cell, but with a chick at the helm.  I think that turned off a lot of gamers and it shouldn't.  This game deserves more than what it got.

To be fair this isn't the games fault but the whole thing is a bad experiance anyways.\n\nI have never played this game on another system before so I can really tell you how is operates there but as a port from Xbox to PC is can tell what's wrong. You have to use the LMB for wierd static things like jumping (because the game dosen't let you jump normally) and crawling through things.

A example: two boxes are near a enemy but one box is closer to him which you want to use for a stealth kill. If you choose the box near the enemy other enemies can see you in the dark (normally enemys can´t see you in the dark) and shoot you. So you must go from the far away located box to the enemy to kill him in stealth mode. The hard thing is that the enemy walks his fixed route up and down and stays only two seconds - in these to seconds you must stealth from the far located box to the enemy and can´t even kill the enemy quick because you have to wait long until the "A" button appears! Other issues are that your shoots sometimes don´t take damage (headshot is impossible) and that the enemys can see you in the dark although stealth is more efficient in the dark. There are many other logical error and dissents! PLEASE DON`T BUY THIS GAME if the issues disturbs you (the devs company doesn´t exist any more)!

Although there are an awful lot of reasons NOT to buy this game, but there is also reasons why you SHOULD buy it.\n\nI bought it in this summer sale for: £0.39 which isn't a bad price at all, I downloaded it and realised i needed more drivers for graphics and also my hardware, which wasn't a problem on my end but the games instead. After about 10 minutes of playing I was drawn in by the graphics and also the physics of the game. I have to say, not bad for a £3.99 game.\n\nAs I carried on playing I found a few... Cons, so to say, some of the AI / NPC's were lacking well... Realism.\nI could kill someone in plain sight and if someone came over, they would not notice the body. But most of this was avoided as I killed most of my opponents with melee steath then pulled them away for good measures.\n\nAs expected in a 3rd person video game which doesn't involve much tatical thought, was the lacking gun play style, I had countless Issues of which I would randomly change weapon or even not end up shooting at all, which was rather annoying. But I soon conqured this in no time after I had about 3 - 4 restarts.\n\nBut overall I have enjoyed the first part of the game and ver interested in the story and how it will progress. On a rating of /10 I would give it: a solid 8 / 10.","June 21, 2014","true","1.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The AI is undoubtedly the worst part of the game. When they go to investigate anything, be it a body or a noise, they will aim their gun directly at the player the entire time they walk near them, regardless of whether they've actually spotted them or not. This makes it extremely hard to tell how they will act next or if they've spotted you. Worst of all, if you lure them somewhere with a whistle, they will walk over to where the noise came from to investigate, then proceed to walk directly towards wherever the player is hiding.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/excruciate/recommended/16720/","excruciate","Excruciate","http://steamcommunity.com/id/excruciate/","717 products in account","One of the most unremarkable games I have ever played. Very generic. A 4/10 at best. The stealth mechanics are non-existent: you can crouch and sneak, but enemies can hear you or see you or spot you in disguise too easily because their cones of vision are programmed very sloppily. Technically, the game feels very unfinished, because it is. Enemy cones of vision are broken: sometimes they cannot see me when I am crouching in a slight shadow right in front of them in a well lit area, other times they can spot me when they shouldn't be able to, like for instance seeing me in disguise through a wall. The graphics suck balls and the sound is instantly forgettable. The gameplay has a very generic game feel and the controls are very loose and generic.\nHowever I was playing through it for quite a while and there is one massive fundamental flaw that had me uninstalling this, never to be played again: a horrific checkpoint system. You can be spotted by guards very easily and end up dying or encounter a game bug like I did and will sometimes have to replay a massive chunk of the level which is unacceptable by todays standards. Having to replay such large parts in such a bland game is extra torture. I was entertaining the possibility of trudging through it and beating the whole game until the final nail was hammered into the coffin. In the level where you go through the trainyard and have to plant explosives on the train, I planted the explosives, watched it blow up, and then discovered I was stuck there because unbeknownst to me because the game has a total lack of direction, I was, I think, supposed to climb back up where I had come before the few seconds it took before the bomb went off. That's the only thing I can think of because I was stuck and could not progress anymore. The final nail came when I selected "load checkpoint" because I had no other choice and it put me way, way back, and I would have had to replay a massive section of the level.\n\nIf a great game that is a proper stealth game (in which this game is unmistakably not one) like Splinter Cell or the new Thief game or even Dishonored, had only a decent checkpointing system, that would be sort of okay. This game is a double threat because not only does it suck bad, the checkpointing system isn't even decent, it totally sucks.\n\nThis game is a 4/10 at best and that is being very generous.","April 7, 2014","false","4.4"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","3","11","0","0"

It is clear to me that the developers did not test the game enough on the early stages or they would not make a good story (as other reviews state) around these horrible mechanics.\n\nI like stealth games a lot and I read some good reviews saying it was a hard game, so I bought this game on a 85% off, therefore I paid less than a cup of coffee and I still don't think it is worth it. If a game does not give you the tools to work yourself around it figuring things for yourself, then it is punishing, not hard. The game thought me how to kill the first enemy (a drunk soldier) and proceed to a part where there is two enemies that I had to wait to split to get one by one. I get the first one and hide the body. When the second one returns, he turns his back and I chase sneaking. But the sneaking is amazingly slow so I try to run (which is appallingly slow too) but he hears me and kills me. The fact that the controls are extremely clunky does not help either.\n\nSo if you want to make the same mistake as me and have another game in the library collecting virtual dust, buy the game. If you appreciate the value of your money, don't.","June 23, 2014","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is better than I could ever imagine! A must have for any stealth game fan, mostly if you like WWII games also. It is as good as a Splinter Cell game, if not even better in some aspects.\n\nRecently I played the Hitman series and it was obvious where Velvet Assassin got its inspiration; although this game isn't an "assassin sandbox" as Hitman is, that fits the theme very well. Not every game should have that kind of openess, which to be honest, turned some Hitman levels into a chore. You can indeed kill your targets using many tricks, and if everything else fails, you still can rely on your silenced pistol, just make sure to hide the body afterwards. It has some good hide mechanics too, including the good old pick at a corner and hide into or behind bushes.\n\nVelvet Assassin uses a checkpoint save system, but they are well distributed, and even if you must replay a big chunk of some level, it isn't a frustratingly hard game; it has its chalenge bits, but everything is very well balanced.\n\nThe game has a dark tone, which fits perfectly with its WWII settings, it runs very well even with the minimum requirements, and it's extremely solid (I didn't find a single bug within my 2 playthroughs); it has astonishing sound FX too, including weapons sounds, environments, the usual guard-talk and a great soundtrack. I can't recommend this one enough for the stealth game funs.","November 29, 2012","true","22.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The stealth in this game is not like other well known stealth games; Assassin's Creed, Splinter Cell, Thief. But it has it's own charm, I bought the game for $0.76, so I really can't complain too much. One thing I will warn players, be prepared to die...A LOT. The levels are pretty bland, and for a 2009 game the graphics are really good. The last level took me over 1 hour to complete...and if this game does anything right, it makes sure you will work for that ending. The ending is sort of disappointing, but it was a fun and frustrating game for 17 hours. There are glitches present, like you getting stuck when trying to climb a box, or enemies animations getting stuck and then killing you when you try to stealth kill them.

Sure.  On sale?  Definitely!  For the 75 cents I paid for it, it was well worth it.  It's an old school stealth game that runs on rails.  But that doesn't automatically make it bad.  The plot was great and the story development felt involved, even if it was scripted.  The mechanics were a little clunky, but were pretty straight forward and they worked well enough.\n\nIt's got some negatives. Checkpoint saves instead of real ones, artificial limits on weapons & ammo to force you to play it stealthily, and an ending that just didn't work for me (a shift from stealth to forced combat at the end, and an unsatisfactory ending to the game), and other pretty minor gripes.  But all in all, a fine purchase for the price, several entertaining hours of play, and better value than anything else I've bought for under a buck in a long time!  Just don't set your AAA game expectations when you get it - compare it to indy titles or other old games that you paid a comparable price for and you'll be very happy with it.\n\nA worthwhile B- or C+ in my book.\n\n","June 12, 2014","true","14.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I somewhat understand the reason why it might be linear.  The devs may have had little to go on and based a lot of the game on the real-life diary of Violet Szabo.  A.I. while not the smartest, can be annoying when they can spot you if they are super close to you.  For the price I paid for it ($1.25) it was a steal.

Games where stealth is the primary focus are not made that often. However, after seeing the relatively average review scores on Metacritic and Steam, I decided to wait for the price to drop. After seeing it for about $1 on Steam I decided to buy it. Let’s just say it turned out to be worth much more than $1. While the game obviously doesn’t have the massive budget and polish of AAA stealth games like Metal Gear Solid, it’s still a great game. You traverse through a great variety of levels, often equipped with nothing but a knife and pistol with few bullets. You generally need to stay hidden since all the Nazis have automatic weapons and you are rather defenseless making this a true stealth game. Running and gunning is rarely an option when up against multiple opponents. The storyline is virtually non-existent and is there just for the sake of having one. Graphics and audio are above average. The game is about 10 hours long.\n\nBottom Line: If you’re looking for another stealth game to play, then Velvet Assassin is for you.\n","May 23, 2015","true","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Whole seasoned with a wonderful video which are directly linked to the storyline.\n\nRating:\nMusic 10/10\nGraphics 10/10\nGameplay 10/10\nPlot 10/10\nClimate 10/10\nOverall Rating 10/10","July 18, 2014","true","13.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you get the damn thing to run in the first place, which you can by looking at the forums, cause come on, Steam is too ♥♥♥♥ing busy to actually get the games running in the first place, why attempt anything at all. So if you get that going, the game will constantly crash there after, which I've heard you can get it running by doing the right combination of settings, but go spend the money you would spend on this game on a lottery ticket, cause you're probably more likely to win big then get this functioning in its full glory.\n\nAfter that, from what I've been able to play, the game is okish. The stealth element is kinda ruined by subpar abilities and just straight up cheating AI. Using whistle to get someone's attention? Well hope they run directly where you want them to, because if they don't they'll creepily look at you the entire time, and despite any actual location you whistled at, they will run right to you. Quality.\n\nThe Silencer pistol works ok, maybe a little iffy on the aim, but the shotgun is way off, like left for dead off. The part where I started writing this review was a forced shooting segment for a leader, think like chapter 3 or 4. Keeps crashing around that part constantly.\n\nReally, if the game worked at its current price, I'd say grab it up, but since it barely functions due to crashes, RUN AWAY!

It is better than I could ever imagine! A must have for any stealth game fan, mostly if you like WWII games also. It is as good as a Splinter Cell game, if not even better in some aspects.\n\nRecently I played the Hitman series and it was obvious where Velvet Assassin got its inspiration; although this game isn't an "assassin sandbox" as Hitman is, that fits the theme very well. Not every game should have that kind of openess, which to be honest, turned some Hitman levels into a chore. You can indeed kill your targets using many tricks, and if everything else fails, you still can rely on your silenced pistol, just make sure to hide the body afterwards. It has some good hide mechanics too, including the good old pick at a corner and hide into or behind bushes.\n\nVelvet Assassin uses a checkpoint save system, but they are well distributed, and even if you must replay a big chunk of some level, it isn't a frustratingly hard game; it has its chalenge bits, but everything is very well balanced.\n\nThe game has a dark tone, which fits perfectly with its WWII settings, it runs very well even with the minimum requirements, and it's extremely solid (I didn't find a single bug within my 2 playthroughs); it has astonishing sound FX too, including weapons sounds, environments, the usual guard-talk and a great soundtrack. I can't recommend this one enough for the stealth game funs.","November 29, 2012","true","22.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Narration and story is the strongest side of this game and truly shows that war never changes. As a titular assassin your task is to eliminate targets by any means necessary and at all cost - even if it requires sending an air strike on tens of thousands of civilians or planting the bullet in the head of your ally just because he could possibly spill the information.\n\nYour toolkit consists of stealth, knife, multiple ranged weapons and environmental hazards (incineration, electrocution, explosion).\n\nBeing a versatile proffesional you can bypass obstacles in numerous ways - either be it a ghost who goes unnoticed till he reaches his target, gunslinger elliminating enemies with bullets, assassin armed with the knife or a butcher running in berserk and slashing humans like pieces of venison. Game itself is stealth focused so open fight is difficult but possible and fun to master, you can even slash armed enemies to death with your knife if you like so. And the character you play do like it - just look at her facial expression when she slits ones throat - this mocking grim of perversive pleasure of taking ones life gives me the creeps.\n\nControls could be annoying at the beginning. Player could think that developers were lazy and can't give character simple actions like climbing, jumping, crawling etc. but later in the game you see that our heroine is really mobile and can do everything we need but we are forbidden to do so until special situation occurs. Then we can jump between rooftops, jump over the fances, pull up on the crates, climb ladders, crawl under structures and so on. Just the narration of the story limits our actions. Because this game is about narration, not about open world slaughter-fest.\n\nCombat possibilities are nice and as a mixture of stealth, gunplay and enviro-kill are really enjoyable. You can start encounter by blowing some barrels with silenced pistol thus killing one guard with explosion and when others are alarmed and go to investigate you stab one with the knife and finish the last one with the shot in the head with your gun. And when suddenly another one shows up 'out of nowhere' you activate your adrenaline rush, dash to him and puncture to death. Or simply sneak through. It is up tou your taste or score you want to get at the end of the mission.\n\nEvery resource in the game requires you to scavenge the map for its replacement - there is no regeneration of adrenaline, health or armor, no basic gun with infinite ammo and you can't even pick up weapons from fallen enemies. Game gives you strict rules how you should play it and let's you enjoy it in a fair manner.\n\nStealth is really basic, being in the shadow means you are invisible up to really close range. You can move bodies, wear disguise, peek through keyholes and lure enemies with the whistle. Being spotted doesn't mean restart at the checkpoint, you can still take cover, pull out the gun and fight back or use mentioned adrenaline which enables short bullet-time.\n\nAI is solid and enemies, when alerted, will look behind corners and turn around nervously so you can't just make noise in one place and stab them in the back - they will see you if they pass close by, they can turn around at the moment you don't expect and they will wander around looking for the source of noise. In gunfight expect to be flanked so sitting in one spot and waiting for enemies to walk into your crosshair can end up badly unless you have really good camping site.\n\nI'm 7 hours into the game, counter says it's 8th out of 12 missions and I'm curiously looking forward how will it end, but it is already worth its price [regular 5e] so I can honestly recommend it right now.","February 7","true","13.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is presented as a stealth game based on the life of a real English spy although the game itself seems to be mostly made up. The spy in this game is called Violette Summer. You get to steer her through various missions in which you are required to deliver a 'package'. A package could be to kill someone, blow something up or actually deliver something. Usually when the package is delivered the mission ends.\n\nEach mission stands on its own and is unconnected to the others and there isn't something that builds up to a climatic end. While the last mission is highly dramatic, as it refers to a real historic event that involved the deaths of the villagers in a small town in France, it isn't one that follows from those that went before.  There is an overall story told through cut scenes in between the missions.\nThis story isn't really special, but there is some nice use of lighting in the imagery. One weak point of the story is that you never get a good idea about Violette Summer . There are no sequences in which she interacts with anyone or that give you a feel of what kind of person she is and why she is in the spy business.\n\nA mission usually breaks down in two parts. One part is the sneaking part, the other part, usually the latter, is the fighting part.\nThe stealth mechanism is something that no stealth veteran would be thrilled about, but if you are impatient and clumsy like me, than it works in a fashion. You can sneak or kill enemies under the noses of others as long as you do it in the dark. When an enemy finds the corpse of one of his fellows he will pursue you quite relentlessly and only sneaking away faster than he walks and keeping hidden al the time makes him give up. When enemies do see you they are pretty deadly and persistent. Otherwise the AI is pretty simple and most enemies will follow predetermined routes.\n\nThe combat in the game feels deliberately made awkward as you have to change from sneak mode to combat mode and vice versa because in combat mode you can't pick up items such as bullets or medic kit. Some weapons are pretty powerful, like the Luger, while others, like the Sturmgewehr, feel weak.   Again the ai isn't very smart, and doesn't take cover for instance. So it is numbers, your lack of bullets and your weak weaponry that makes them a danger.\n\nWould I recommend this game?\nI finished it in 14 hours of game play. Which means to me that I say yes but only if it is less than 8 dollars/euros and you don't expect too much from it. It isn't worth more.","April 23","true","14.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

I love the voice acting its very good along with the game play,and the graphics are very good. If you like World War 2 games ,or any stealth ,and games like Sniper Elite 1 through 3 that is also set in an world war 2 setting you will like this game.\n\nJust being Pratical if the main character of Velvet Assassin Violette Szabo would get married to another video gamer character it would be Karl Fairburne from the Sniper Elite series.\n\nI think Metacritics 61 percent is Very underated I would of given this game an critic score of 80 percent ,and this game is worth more than the less than 99 cents I paid for it on steam durning a sale not long ago. For an old older game yes it is awesome to get games for lower prices ,but too low for A great game.\n\nmy score 8.0/10\n\n\nCons\n\nWhile Velvet Assassin Violette Szabo is in a comma, and there are times that are alittle bit to dreamy like fansty for a world war 2 game that are in the story cutscenes ,and in game play as she is telling her story about when she was an Assassin in World War 2; however, i can understand because it is showing the state of mind she is in while she is in a comma , and dreaming as she tells her story. Very awesome game a must play of you like world war 2 games.\n\n\nCheers,","April 13","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Charismatic and sexy protagonist.  I enjoyed the gameplay, and felt drawn in by the story.  It was challenging and rewarding, missions were varied and required some thinking (only one frustrating part I recall).  About 10 hours of gameplay if you go for the collectibles/side objectives.  RPG elements in that you can upgrade the main character.\n7/10","May 2","true","9.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Problem fixed for me first time.  I loved this little stealth game on the 360. It's got it's flaws, but if you like a stealth game and WW2 then it's not a bad pick. Just don't be expecting AAA status and you should be fine with it.","April 30","true","11.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is presented as a stealth game based on the life of a real English spy although the game itself seems to be mostly made up. The spy in this game is called Violette Summer. You get to steer her through various missions in which you are required to deliver a 'package'. A package could be to kill someone, blow something up or actually deliver something. Usually when the package is delivered the mission ends.\n\nEach mission stands on its own and is unconnected to the others and there isn't something that builds up to a climatic end. While the last mission is highly dramatic, as it refers to a real historic event that involved the deaths of the villagers in a small town in France, it isn't one that follows from those that went before.  There is an overall story told through cut scenes in between the missions.\nThis story isn't really special, but there is some nice use of lighting in the imagery. One weak point of the story is that you never get a good idea about Violette Summer . There are no sequences in which she interacts with anyone or that give you a feel of what kind of person she is and why she is in the spy business.\n\nA mission usually breaks down in two parts. One part is the sneaking part, the other part, usually the latter, is the fighting part.\nThe stealth mechanism is something that no stealth veteran would be thrilled about, but if you are impatient and clumsy like me, than it works in a fashion. You can sneak or kill enemies under the noses of others as long as you do it in the dark. When an enemy finds the corpse of one of his fellows he will pursue you quite relentlessly and only sneaking away faster than he walks and keeping hidden al the time makes him give up. When enemies do see you they are pretty deadly and persistent. Otherwise the AI is pretty simple and most enemies will follow predetermined routes.\n\nThe combat in the game feels deliberately made awkward as you have to change from sneak mode to combat mode and vice versa because in combat mode you can't pick up items such as bullets or medic kit. Some weapons are pretty powerful, like the Luger, while others, like the Sturmgewehr, feel weak.   Again the ai isn't very smart, and doesn't take cover for instance. So it is numbers, your lack of bullets and your weak weaponry that makes them a danger.\n\nWould I recommend this game?\nI finished it in 14 hours of game play. Which means to me that I say yes but only if it is less than 8 dollars/euros and you don't expect too much from it. It isn't worth more.","April 23","true","14.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

I love the voice acting its very good along with the game play,and the graphics are very good. If you like World War 2 games ,or any stealth ,and games like Sniper Elite 1 through 3 that is also set in an world war 2 setting you will like this game.\n\nJust being Pratical if the main character of Velvet Assassin Violette Szabo would get married to another video gamer character it would be Karl Fairburne from the Sniper Elite series.\n\nI think Metacritics 61 percent is Very underated I would of given this game an critic score of 80 percent ,and this game is worth more than the less than 99 cents I paid for it on steam durning a sale not long ago. For an old older game yes it is awesome to get games for lower prices ,but too low for A great game.\n\nmy score 8.0/10\n\n\nCons\n\nWhile Velvet Assassin Violette Szabo is in a comma, and there are times that are alittle bit to dreamy like fansty for a world war 2 game that are in the story cutscenes ,and in game play as she is telling her story about when she was an Assassin in World War 2; however, i can understand because it is showing the state of mind she is in while she is in a comma , and dreaming as she tells her story. Very awesome game a must play of you like world war 2 games.\n\n\nCheers,","April 13","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
