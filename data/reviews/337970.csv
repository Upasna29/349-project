No, it does not! The game it self is not what I was expecting it to be, however like all games it has its upsides and downsides. Upsides: The animal selection is large enough for a zoo game, and on top of that, Wild creatures has extinct animals you can bring back including two dinosaurs, Velociraptor and Archaeopteryx. Another upside is that you can use a certain fences to make a tank using a water pump. Downsides: Like in all zoo games, the guests are as need as **** ( are real zoo guests this flippin' needy!). One thing that I found weird is that instead of placing animals, you place houses that are specific to a species of animal and then you can buy the animal that the house is specified for (what happens if I want to put tigers in an enclosure with a lion house?!). Overall this game is interesting enough if you love animals.\n\nTotal score: 7/10","April 22, 2015","true","17.9"," 29 of 33 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","29","33","3","0"

I was a HUGE fan of the Zoo Tycoon franchise, and being that it isn't available on Steam (and my laptop has no disk drive) I downloaded the original "Wildlife Park" to see how I like it. I LOVED IT, so I downloaded the "Wild Creatures" expansion. Having loved that so much as well, I play this game more than any others I've gotten from Steam.\n\nBottom line: LOVE the original title and the "Wild Creatures" expansion more than I ever loved Zoo Tycoon and it's entire franchise.\n\nYes, I would recommend this game to EVERYBODY that loved (or even just liked or enjoyed) Zoo Tycoon.","August 7, 2015","true","25.9"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"
