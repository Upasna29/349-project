"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aprofilehere/recommended/379320/","aprofilehere","Gunderson Mallard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aprofilehere/","2360 products in account","Clandestinity of Elsie is a tough game to recommend. It is not terrible, but it is not terribly remarkable either.\n\nThe plot is fairly heavy handed and predictable early on. Which is a shame because other reviews and forum posts had led me to expect something more than something so obvious. Over the few hours it takes to complete the game there is very little story in general, and I don't just mean the direct narration. There are a handful of cutscenes that may have been meant to offer exposition, but they either come across as redundant (the mentally unstable protagonist Warrick is mentally unstable) or pointless (to avoid spoilers, the game details some event far in the past that doesn't really add anything). Despite all of the constant text provided by Warrick, he actually shares very little, often just stating generic thoughts like "what luck, a medkit!" or "There is nothing in the trash, but what was I expecting?" Or "6 bullets, that's great!" (not actual quotes, but similar texts popped up throughout). There is also an extremely small cast of characters here, and that are not so much mysterious as they are underdeveloped. I kept my eye out hoping to find some kind of indirect narration hidden in item descriptions, locations, and so on, but nothing came from it. Even the use of a Nagant seems like a missed opportunity.\n\nThe game also boasts a "psychological story with mind-bending qualities," but I did not really see any thing psychological besides the fact that someone mentions they are not wedding counselor (to which Warrick replies "you sure sound like one," the intrigue! Mysteries abound!). The mind-bending aspect does not really work because we have no relative sense of what's normal or strange in the game, and there is never much believeablitiy on any surface of the game. That is to say, the player has no sense of something mind-bending going on (besides Warrick stating how strange and nightmarish this is, and yet he seems to be fine scrounging around for bloodbags and ammo). No mechanic or element of the story really warps the players perception of the game's story or world. This could be a limit of engine, but even Hotline MIami (through some strange text and dates) and Super Mario Bros 3 (through small visual elements) prod the player to question the game world they inhabit.\n\nMechanics wise, it is nice to see an RPGmaker that is not form of RPG or turn based combat. However, combat feels too limited to be intense. Making the revolver fire slow so that the enemy can hurt the player was a good choice, but that's unfortunately all the game can offer. Again, this might just be due to the engine or something, but your character aims in four directions and enemies run on a grid, so those are two elements that mar the aforementioned solid mechanic of slow fire rate. To add on to this, there are quite a few sections of the game where you are confined to tight hallways so combat turns into you hearing the monsters cue, and then just firing forward. Because the game seems to really reach for a psychological aspect, the lack of some sort of fear mechanic was a bit strange (think Call of Cthluhu: Darkest Corners of the Earth, or Amnesia). There are some areas that do allow you to simply sneak past or run by enemies rather than engage, which, again, is refreshing for an RPGmaker game.\n\nNormally I wouldn't comment on graphics (though I will praise style), but I do feel like the graphics affect the gameplay in this case. The lighting and coloring make it very hard to see. It is understandable for a game  that is trying to be spooky to have low lighting and darker colors, but making a game with all the all browns and greys in the crayon box under dim lighting can strain the players' eyes.\n\nThough it is definitely playable, and at parts enjoyable, I do not find myself easily recommending this. It is a farily short game that gets talked up a bit too much, and offered a decent experience. At the same time, it does not do anything particuarly well or different. I would much rather give this game a lukewarm "might recommend," but Steam only gives me two options so for now I cannot see myself recommending this game. If you plan on enjoying it, you really should go in with low expectations.","September 11, 2015","false","3.8"," 24 of 29 people (83%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","83","24","29","5","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/recommended/379320/","Maxmetpt","Maxmetpt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/","704 products in account","Clandestinity of Elsie was a big letdown, looking at all of the other reviews. They're rather suspicious, I'd say, mostly claiming that same thing. "It's very much like Silent Hill and Resident Evil, true survival horror game!"... It's a really standard game, to me. It had very little going for it.\n\nI have not played those old-school horror games (nor am I that big into horror games in general), but the only similarity I've found is how clunky the controls are. Sure, it creates some tension when you know you have to face enemies, but it's not nearly enough to support the previous claims.\n\nThis is an RPGMaker game, and it looks like one. There's almost nothing to make it stand-out in the regard. However, there are 2 aspects that are above average RPGMaker game. First, it's the lighting system, with actual shadow casting that does a fairly good job in maintaining the atmosphere. Then, there's the resolution fitting my screen, instead of the game misreading my desired aspect ratio and screwing fullscreen up.\n\nThese 2 aspects, however, are present, but not particularly stellar. The resolution is a pure upscale, which doesn't look very good. The lighting system is also very primitive and rough. I think it's a script "outside" of their control, but still...\nIt's 4 directional, which isn't good. Making it mouse controlled would make it actually useful to look around corners and such. But no, it's just a light directly in front of you.\n\nAnyway, my biggest problems is this: the game does nothing new, and the remotely interesting parts of the game are completely outside of the player's control.\nThe game is very transparent as to its story and meaning even before the end, so I'll not be spoiling much (do not worry, I won't spoil the ending).\n\nYou're a person with mental problems and an alcoholic. That's rather overdone, but hey, no problem. What is a problem is that it goes nowhere with it.\n\nThe alcoholism, for example, is a trigger for allucinations. You drink only once or twice in the game, and it's completely scripted. "You will drink because I'm making you drink" is what the game says. Just because we need to keep things moving.\nYou don't even press a button to drink, it's like a cuscene.\nAs a counter-example, I'll mention the game Spate. That game was a 2D platformer about an alcoholic father as well. The difference is that drinking actually changed things and was completely in the player's control. It would twist the environment, but also make the player faster and jump higher. It was a tradeoff. It wasn't needed to complete the game, but it helped. It made you feel more powerful, but certainly wasn't a necessity. That was a good usage.\nThis game has none of that.\n\nThen, there's the fact that, as I said, there's a very distinct barrier between the game and the story. When you play, you're not playing the story. You're just walking through the environment, with the occasional monster appearing.\nEverything that's relevant to the story is told through cutscenes. Everything.\n\nThe gameplay is just """exploring""" every room to find ammo and health packs, killing every monster until the next bit of story. Find key, open door, keep going, rinse and repeat. None of your actions has any impact or influence in the game.\n\nThe comparison with Lone Survivor has been made by a reviewer. I'll have to disagree 100%, as Lone Survivor had very interesting mechanics that affected what happened in the game world. The pills, for example. Even the shooting had significance. Every action had some meaning in that game. In this game, it's mostly filler.\n\n\nThe game also lacks in the "game" department. Ammo is found everywhere. Basically right before/after a monster, you'll find ammo, making the system pointless. Might as well give me a gun with infinite ammo.\nThe stealth aspect of the game (trying to go unnoticed) isn't the best, as it's not very clear when you can be detected or not.\nThe shooting is slow, making it very unlikely that you can escape without getting hit most of the time. Most of the enemies are completely undetectable until it's too late as well! They're near you, in the dark, without any sound. Until they run at you, that is. That's not a good way of doing things, in my opinion.\n\nWhat else?\nWell, the environments have little to no thought put into them. They're just filler. Most of the building have windows with 3 bullet holes in them, just because. The place is filled with trash, mattresses and blood, without any environmental story telling or clues of any sort.\n\nMost of the rooms are just furniture thrown together with no sense of characterizations of any sort (aside from "this generic person tried to kill himself - that's it").\n\nI'm sorry, I realize that I sound very bitter. I didn't hate the game that much, but I just found nothing new or interesting in here. And it isn't a greatly executed game either. It's just a generic RPGMaker game... being sold.\n\n\nHopefully, this review brings another perspective to potential players. If you still want to try the game, go ahead! Maybe there's something in there that just didn't click with me. I just think that it adds nothing to the genre at all.\n\nTry Lone Survival, Knock-knock and Home if you're looking for something more interesting.","August 23, 2015","false","3.2"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","15","21","0","0"

Clandestinity of Elsie is an RPG Maker game hacked into a something resembling Silent Hill 2, pitting you as an unstable World War II veteran against a mess of creepy crawlies standing between you and your missing wife. The design is classic survival horror, meting out just enough bullets and medkits to keep you rolling to the inevitable conclusion. There are a few clever additions as well, such as using sound to lure enemies out and adrenaline doses to let you move faster.\n\nNone of this really gets around the fact that this is an RPG Maker game kit-bashed into something that is not an RPG. Don't get me wrong, I love RPG Maker and there's nothing stopping good games from being made with it. But it's not designed for action, and so the combat becomes my chief complaint about Clandestinity. Your dude scoots around the gridlike maps in a sticky, unresponsive way, which makes evading the far swifter enemies impossible. You have to draw your gun before firing and there are long delays between shots, so if a basic foe gets the drop on you, it's guaranteed to get two or three hits on you. Early on the enemies are sparse enough to sneak around and take out smartly, but by the back half of the game they form a veritable gauntlet of crappy shooting.\n\nThe level design is my other issue with the game, and I feel the only thing I REALLY need to say here is that there are two sewer levels. They're the two longest areas in the game as well, and are bookended by a sewage plant and a warehouse using the same tileset. The other locales are functional but leave little exploration or interaction to fill the void. Most of the game is lacking in scares as well, despite the competent atmosphere and creepy enemies. In fact, almost all the horror hinges on the loud musical cues when enemies spot you, which lose all effectiveness by the damnable sewer levels that run you face-first into foes from around blind corners.\n\nAs for the story, well, there's a reason I brought up Silent Hill 2 early on. I know everyone has a horror boner that's lasted way longer than 4 hours for that joint, but the indie crowd really needs to let it go. I'm at the point where horror games that are all in the protagonist's head feel like they're cheating me, discarding any sort of world-building for an easy it-was-all-a-dream-esque handwave. You need serious writing chops to make imaginary monsters work, and Clandestinity falls far short with a disjointed story almost completely divested from the events of the game. It's an interesting experiment, and it might make you jump a few times, but the secret kept here just isn't worth it.","October 14, 2015","false","2.1"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","10","15","0","0"

Guess I don't play games of this nature (read: old-school, "retro" RPG) too often.  I'm going to put it down to that, though many of the other (unremappable?) keyboard buttons seemed like odd choices also:  A to equip gun, S to shoot, D to reload?  I also had difficulty trying to work out where DOORS and trivial things like that were, but after not TOO long I got the hang of things enough to concentrate on the GAME, per se (hint: always be on the look-out for doormats and red arrows)!  I've also experienced some crashing issues, but it's early days yet for the game's release (so they'll hopefully be fixed), and the save system is fortunately generous enough to render this not TOO huge an issue (once you hit the first save point, you can pretty much save at any time).  Anyway, enough about minor technical issues...with no further ado, let's get on with the review...\n\nA few years back, some guy named Jasper Byrne had the perversity to try and emulate the "feel" of a Silent Hill game with a heavily-pixelated, 2D, side-scrolling point-of-view.  He was surprisingly successful with this, and despite it not being an instant "classic" or anything, Lone Survivor was certainly a game well worth experiencing for those of us with an interest in seeing the horror gaming genre pushed to its debatable "limits".  A couple of years later we got something called Motte Island, which while not as successful, was intriguing in its attempt to use a heavily-pixelated, top-down perspective in a "survival horror" setting.  Now someone has thought to make an old-school survival horror game with RPG Maker software, and the results are...well, perhaps not much better than those of (the definitely dumber, but decidedly spookier) Motte Island, but full points for trying one way or another.\n\nThere's no denying there's some great IDEAS here, and in my opinion, that's where Clandestinity of Elsie's greatest strengths lie:  Ideas and storytelling.  And there's obviously nothing "wrong" with that!  First of all, there's a very interesting twist on the Silent Hill notion of alternating lighter/darker dimensions, seemingly triggered by the main character's ALCOHOLISM!  A very inspired, and thematically valid, idea indeed.  And events are set in motion by the protagonist's wife leaving him due to said alcoholism, which again is very sound storytelling logic (a lot of you budding game-makers out there - and not to mention quite a few of the so-called "professionals" - should probably start taking notes).  Now, there's also a bit of dodgy logic here and there - apparently our hero "never leaves the house" without a GUN, so I don't know what part of America or what-not he's supposed to be living in, but here in Brisbane, Australia I can walk fifteen minutes to my local gym at ten o'clock at night with just an UMBRELLA to make me feel sufficiently safe!  But for the most part, certainly as video games go, this one is intelligently conceived and written, and I'll just give the developer the benefit of the doubt that he lives in a more dangerous part of the world than I do, hence the I'm-just-off-to-the-local-shops-better-take-my-gun mentality (and, in all fairness, our character IS a "mentally damaged alcoholic and war veteran", so I guess the dude's gonna be a little on the "paranoid" side).\n\nNow, I haven't quite reached the end of the game yet, so the jury's still a bit out as regards just how pure and perfect the story will pan out to be.  I believe that I can safely say, however, that this project was something of a labour of love for the developer - that, or he's awfully good at covering up the fact that he's just a cynical hack - and given the (perhaps quite realistic) limitations he has set for his debut Steam product, I'm certainly interested to see what he gets up to next, especially if it's made outside the confines of RPG maker (not really the best medium for making a truly "scary" game, it has to be said).  As for the purchase price, it's a tad ambitious all things considered, but I'll happily recommend this, on sale, to anyone interested in what possibilities the future might hold for horror gaming.  I'm personally yet to see anything as inspired and successful as the "first-person stealth horror" revolution of recent years kicked off by Frictional Games, but at least folks like Cole Neumann are TRYING...and for this I applaud him.  There may be hope for our beloved genre yet.\n\nVerdict: 7.5/10.","July 9, 2015","true","7.5"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","12","19","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheRetroKnight/recommended/379320/","TheRetroKnight","TheRetroKnight","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheRetroKnight/","31 products in account",""Clandestinity of Elsie" is one of those unique RPG Maker survival-horror games which really show the horror of things. This game has a gripping atmosphere and a very well-written storyline, and you should try it out. So if you love survival-horror games, then this is a must buy. If not, continue the review!\n\nThe story in this game is at first very basic, but becomes more complex as you progress through its two hours and a few minutes. It is short, but it's still a good game. However, I did search every corner in an area for ammo, so maybe even less time if you just rush through the game. The story is about a WWII veteran who returns from the war to his wife. He has become a huge alcoholic, and wakes up one day to discover that his wife, Elsie, is missing. So he goes though various environments to go and find her, and he even encounters some horrifying monsters along the way.\n\nAs for gameplay, it's very simple. You equip your gun by pressing a button, and shoot and reload with another. The rest of the buttons are to sprint (only when your gun isn't equipped), to move, and of course to interact with certain objects in the environment. The game has a good system in which objects that can be examined are marked with a yellow exclamation mark, so you don't go through the whole area smashing your spacebar. The fighting is a bit clunky at first, but you get use to it. However, you cannot just waste bullets and healing items. Healing items are pretty rare, and you are given enough bullets to probably kill all the monsters in the game, but I don't recommend it. This is a game where you must make your shots count, and use your healing items when you're close to dying so you don't waste most of it. And you are only given one gun in the game, which is a Russian revolver which can hold up to seven bullets.\n\nThe big question is: Is the game scary? At some moments, it can be a bit dark and creepy, but I never found it to be scary or make me jump.\n\nAfter completing the game, I must say it has a very dark, twisting, but surprising ending. I don't recommend this game to any teenagers who are severly depressed, because this game does not have a happy ending. Not even close to a happy ending.\n\nThis game is a good RPG Maker survival-horror game, and if you can handle the dark storyline and the slightly clunky fighting mechanics, then you will have fun in your (around) two hour journey through the game that is: "Clandestinity of Elsie".\n\n","September 14, 2015","true","3.5"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

Don't mind RPGmaker games? Then this is a buy. It's on sale now for the holiday sale for $1, so now's a good time.\n\nEssentially a Silent Hill 2 deMake made using RPGmaker. Much better than it sounds. Story is somewhat predictable, but fairly well-written and well-made, if depressing as hell. I got it in a bundle at some point, played the whole thing through in one sitting, took 3.5 hours.\n\nPros:\n\nHas a real Silent Hill feel to it, unlike 99% of these other indie horror games. Pretty good story. The art style was knocked off SH quite well. Never really thought you could do an RPGmaker game inspired by SH and it'd look decent. As far as these sorts of games go, I enjoyed it more than Lone Survivor (though I imagine it's going to appeal to many of the same people). If you like this sort of thing, try Silence of Sleep, too.\n\nThe revolver mechanic in combat (there's a noticeable pause after each shot) is a really good idea and keeps the shooting from getting too easy. Knockback after enemies are shot is also well-done. Combat is tense because of that. Combat's honestly not bad. Not great, but not bad.\n\nCons:\n\nNot 1, but 2 sewer levels. I mean Jesus Christ, just cut the level if you're going to give me the same level, with the same ugly tilesets and maze twice. I'll let you get away with one sewer level to pad the game but 2 is a bit much.\n\nNo bosses.\n\nLinear.\n\nLone Survivor had great sound to go with the game. While I prefer this game overall, the sound is a bit lackluster.\n\nThe run mechanic (integral to SH) is kind of pointless here since most of the time enemies wind up blocking your escape path (there's usually only one) and you have to shoot them anyway. Enemies can be lured using sound, but it's easier to just shoot everything. Combat is not that good (not that bad either), but you don't really notice its shortcomings until the park and sewer levels since you start getting ambushed and dying when you can't really run anywhere. Combat is still better than I expected since as far as I was aware, RPG maker has no capacity whatsoever to do this.\n\nRecommended. Easy buy for survival horror and SH fans.\n\nIncidentally, probably one of the better uses of RPGmaker after Space Funeral and To the Moon.","December 29, 2015","true","3.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

You will get hit offten in combat but you will find health kits at a rate where you should not have to worry to much.\n\nThe level design is sometimes open, like in the city where you can enter many buildings at will. But at other times is awfull like in the *two* sewer levels where you just walk around in a dark maze and get lost for 15 minutes.\n\nOverall Clandestinity of Elsie reaches its goals and is a good game if you have played silent hill or most psychological horror games then you will know where the story is going before it ends but it is well told and when you play a rpg maker game then the story is what matters most.\n\n\n\n\n","August 2, 2015","true","3.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The maps are beautiful and the story seems very engaging if not a little clichéd (this is a personal thought but the angsty white protagonist with alcohol problems is getting a little dulled down). Still this game sure had a team working on it that had a lot of great ideas and over all this should set up for a good experience.\n\nI'm saddened to say though that there are a lot of things weighing this game down. For a first, I know that everyone loves the : "Awesome light" script. I use it myself. But a rule of thumb is to not use this script with enormous maps. This has caused me to have massive lagging whenever I play the game, the only time it runs smooth is in the save room. I will point out my compute can play Skyrim on nice graphical settings without lagging so it is sort of an issue when a little RPG maker game is almost unplayable.\n\nThere is also too little damn healing items. I've explored almost everything, since this game takes heavy inspiration from old school horror games where exploration is key. But it has more often than not caused me to get ambushed by enemies and end up with me having to waste whatever health item I find.\n\nPicking up on that last note: the enemies comes out of ♥♥♥♥ing nowhere at the speed of the road runner and with the mapping it is too damn easy for them to corner you and land at least one hit before your slow gun manages to do any damage at all. This has lead me into a situation where I'm now all out of health items and the enemies gang up on me without me standing a chance to defend myself.\n\nOver all there is a lot of good thoughts going into this game but it is weighted down by the too dark environment and the lagging along with the enemies that come at you at 180 km/h. I would say that this game is worth a play but I can't say that my playing of it was the least bit pleasurable.","September 20, 2015","false","1.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I did not like this save scumming but the encounters honestly feel unfair, especially when you're faced with one just round the corner and are expected to run backwards, turn and fire quickly with controls that feel slightly unresponsive: it also felt like just a way to make the game longer without putting actual content in it.\n\nDespite my gripes with the final levels I feel the strong beginning, story and atmosphere make Clandestinity of Elsie a decent purchase for those interested in a dfferent take on the horror genre: just wait for a sale or bundle if the mentioned problems make you doubtful.","September 23, 2015","true","3.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's not amazing or anything, but it's enough to make you want to find out what happens next.\n- It looks pretty. The lighting effects from the flashlight are pretty cool. I appreciate the time and effort that went into making it look good.\n\nBut....\nThe bad:\n- Even though the story is okay, it can sometimes be hard to follow. I understand that it's a psy-horror game that's supposed to be confusing, but it is to a fault in this case.\n- The "darkness" aspect of this game is terrible. It is so hard to see and your cone of flashlight is so small that you can't even tell what's around you most of the time. I can think of a great example: I was on a road in the middle of a storm and all of a sudden a monster was chasing me. I couldn't even see where he was! I eventually had to stop, turn around, and wait a few seconds for it to come close enough that I could actually see it.\n- On that note, the combat system in this game is horrible. You have a 7-shot revolver that shoots only once every 2 or 3 seconds. You can't back up, strafe, or do any sort of aiming, so you just have to take hits sometimes.At least it reloads faster than an actual revolver.\n- The controls also just feel a bit sluggish in general. I try to move and it feels like it takes 1 or 2 seconds for the game to react to my movement.\n- The "music" (if you can call it that; it's more like just vibrations from a digeridoo) is grossly repetitive and actually kinda painful to listen to. It just drones on at an extremely low bass note that is hard to listen to for extended periods of time. There's a bit of relief when you encounter an enemy or when you progress in the story, as it plays something different then, but give it 15 seconds and it's back to the droning.\n- And finally, variety. I will say I've only played for about 35 minutes, but at that point, I had seen about 6 enemies, and they were all the exact same mummy-looking thing. It got boring.\n\nI will say the worst thing on this list is the music. It's just unpleasant. There's nothing wrong with unsettling music in a horror game, but please make it less painful to listen to. The enemy chase music is a perfect example of music that is uncomfortable, but doesn't make you want to take your headphones out for fear of getting a headache.\n\nSpeaking of which, I do indeed have a headache now.","April 21","false","0.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I read the reviews that it is a short game so I decided to finish it.  The background music is so generic and I really only notice 2 kinds of music the whole game: the regular background one or the one when the monsters noticed you.  I'm probably really dumb or something but even when I finished, I had no idea who Hat man, alice or what the zombies/monsters were (or meant).  I only understood what happened with the wife because that was literally the ending.  The game tries to do something interesting by constantly flashing some scenes but I didn't understand what it was trying to say.\n\nThe idea was really cool, to make a zombie fighting game.  However, the slow response time of this game (maybe because it is rpgmaker) makes it very difficult.  If you watch the gameplay of the fighting sequence in the video, I think some of the fighting they make it 2x faster.  When I was playing, it is very difficult to shoot, kite, and then shoot without getting hit because of the response time.  Basically, there is no mechanics to this game.  On top of that, for a zombie/survival horror (not really that genre), it is hard to be scared if you can't kite without getting dumped on by zombies.\n\nEverything about this game was just mediocre and tedious.  I got it from a bundle so it costed me 0.36.  I know people are really into retro and all that old school gaming stuff, but modern games should not confine themselves and suffer from those problems that snes had.\n\nI straight up didn't enjoy the game, but I don't want to ruin someone's career by leaving a thumb's down since a lot of people don't read reviews.","July 18, 2015","true","9.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I've played very little so far, but enough to get really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off when I get constantly stopped for the sake of the main character saying something expository and or stupid. Almost every thirty seconds I have to stop for a scripted event to walk me somewhere, or a "cutscene" of more expository text. I can't really skip dialog, so it gets annoying fast.\n\nFurther, the stuff that is being said is painfully obvious, or painfully pointless. Sometimes both. For example, being forced to stop for the character to comment on and on about how a situation is weird. It added nothing and made me think nothing but "he's saying this because the creator is not confident enough that the scene itself felt truly weird." Plus, when I accidentally click on a background object that is unimportant, but have to wait three-five seconds for the character to comment on it being unimportant, again, it gets pretty painful.\n\nThe game runs well and is competently programmed. Graphics are unremarkable, but by no means bad. I will say the controls could use some work.\n\nOverall, I'd give this 2/5 stars. Dev clearly put effort in, but it is just not an entertaining experience.","June 5","false","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
