It is made in order to make difficult for the player to prevent the history repeating over again (or going worse for the country you are playing with).\n\nWhile instructions would be nice, the internet is vast and has quite a few explanations and tutorials.\n\nYeah, it's an old game, graphics are not impressive at all, but really, who cares? it's not the point of this game. Also as your processor doesn't work much, you can play quite a few hours on your laptop before running out of battery, which is nice.\n\nI totally recommend it, it's worth every dollar and you get tons of hours of gameplay due to it's almost infinite replayability.\n\nOnly advice: don't get frustrated if you get your ♥♥♥ kicked several times, you'll learn more and more each time.","April 23, 2014","true","132.0"," 59 of 63 people (94%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","94","59","63","3","0"

However since buying this game I am happy to say it was not a waste of time or money to do so. The first thing I would like to point out is the fact this game is not ment for the casual gamer there is deep stratagy involved within, economically and also in the combat system.\n\nA strong feature of this particular game is the combat system it is complex however simple to grasp at base level for a better understanding some games will have to be played, or articles and tutorials will have to be delved into. However don't depend upon your militaristic skills for global domination the game might have a few nasty suprises in store for 'badboys' as it is known in game. The greatness of this game is that econimic management can be done quickly if required but fine tuneing is applicable whenever you are not amist a conquest so there is allways something to do.\n\nHowever I will admit that the diplomacy compared to Victoria 2 is much weaker and not as intresting to undergo and power difficult to obtain through the system in place, also some may find the graphics ugly and old fasioned which they are but I assure you you will get used to them and find a unique appeal if you give it time.\n\nThe ability to play as any nation in the world across 4 diffrent starting points adds a lot of replayabilty into this game from either remaining a global power or starting from scratch and building a new economic and military superpower for the world to fear.\n\nMilitarist or economist? New or old power? The world can be your oyster but can you make it?","December 2, 2013","true","349.5"," 32 of 34 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","32","34","0","0"

Fight of the pesky Austrians and French and unify the glory that is the German Empire.\n\nLooking for a bit more, "FREEDOM"!?!? Play the Yanks and have them whip Mexico into submission over Texas, emancipate the crap out of the Confederate States of America, and "liberate" Cuba from the control of the Spanish.\n\nAll and all, this a game that you can play from all fronts; from the great and powerful United Kingdom to the feeble but determined-to-reach-glory Chinese.
