A quest to fix time and save the almighty paper that has the power to rewrite history. I don’t want to give too much away but the story is quite a tearjerker and with more suspense than anything i've played in years. The gameplay is not dated at all, and the graphics look almost as good as the original crysis. The game keeps track of your choices and everything has an impact. The level design is spectacular, giving you many different ways to solve the many puzzles and encounters in the game. The cinematics are also stunning, clearly ahead of their time. The only real complaint I have is that sometimes it’s way to easy to be killed, Dark Souls really took some pointers from Putt Putt, other than that its quite an experience. I would not recommend this for those under 18 because of the dark themes and surprisingly lewd content and language. I’d also like to note that you must be a seasoned gamer to truly appreciate some of the mechanics and get the most out of your experience. All in all Putt Putt Travels Through Time is a justice to gamers everywhere, and deserves it’s place in the vaults of time.","December 31, 2014","true","0.2"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","84","21","25","22","0"

Putt-Putt Travels Through Time is no exception. Colorful graphics, catchy music, fun characters, and overall, is the perfect game for a child. If you're older, it'll no doubt be no challenge to beat (it took me about thirty minutes, even though I have over an hour on my records), but when you're younger, it'll take some time.

A time where when you got stuck on level 3 of Battletoads, you were pretty much screwed (Okay, this game is past that, but I have a review I'm trying to do here.) Basically, anyone who plays this is the gamer equivalent of an Amish. I can already hear the IBM computers.\n\nAll laughs aside, this game is great if you're 6 years old, and I assure you I am. The animation is appealing, the things you click on are varied enough so that you don't slump over dead from boredom, and the puzzles aren't completely mindless.\n\nDon't play this game unless you're really young or have siblings, or you just want to feel the NESTELGUH dripping from your sensitive parts.\n\n8.5/10","June 10, 2015","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Way shorter than Saves the Zoo or joins the circus to me. It has lots of variety due to its multiple areas. Still a good game I would wait for a sale though.

I was definitely five when I played this for hours on end. Nonetheless I learned and gained so much from it I'd recommend to any young child, a simple point-and-click adventure can sure keep lasting values, arithmetic, and humor.\n\nTo the present age of twenty-two every few years I've craved and wondered what a Chewy Fruity Wagon Wheel would taste like, and nothing has  seemed worthy yet. I'll update if I do find something as similar as possible.","January 29, 2015","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
