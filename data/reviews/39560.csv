Or sequel. Hard to tell by now. It adds very few new elements, just few new levels. It started as a fan project, not unlike Overdose, and was released in a whooping 2009, 5 years after original Painkiller. And I am afraid, this game indeed feels like unfinished amateur mod.\n\nDespite running on old engine, it supports wide-screen. HUD will be stretched though.\n\nBut from technical side this game is a horrible mess. There are bugs everywhere. Everywhere, I said! It surely has no problems spawning enemies half-sunk into floor. Or spawning them outside of level, where they will try to chase you until you activate next checkpoint. There is even a glitchy physics bridge in level 3, trying to cross which is suicide. Developers even just teleport you across.\nIt gets ridiculous at the end of level 4. The voice tells you "watch out, there is a huge demon in front" and then boss spawns in. And instantly dies in water, with exit activating the very next second.\n\nNot only that, but due to levels being huge, the loading and performance are beyond tolerable! Overdose already had loading 4 times longer than in original Painkiller. Resurrection's loadings are 4 times longer than Overdose ones! Be ready to spend 5 minutes. Or more. Though, I did notice that loading a save was almost instantious, developers probably changed the way that it works. But they didn't do it properly, as very likely loading a quicksave will lead to even more glitches. At very least some music stopped working. Just fully reload checkpoint.\nOh, yes, and the fact that Painkiller engine doesn't know how to use multi-core processor shows. Get ready for non-stop slow motion, you will have to enjoy it no matter the PC.\n\nImportant: Because game tries to save you from this mess, there are chances that level geometry of level 4 will just refuse to load. It just will not. You will just fall and die in void. Because quality gaming. To fix this you will have to just reinstall game and then restore your map-screen autosave. It works for some reason.\n\nAs for multiplayer, then well. It still has same multiplayer as from Painkiller, that is Deathmatch-based. No new maps. Or maybe those are from Overdose. I didn't check because no one playes this game. And seeing how Gamespy was shut down, you aren't going to find servers easily. Can still connect directly, true.\n\nThe story follows Bill who is speaks of himself as cold-blooded assassin. Who also somehow manages to kill bad people only. And then freaks out and tries to stop the bus full of people exploding. And then thinks that this is the only reason that he is going to Hell. Oh yea, and then he kills many many demons. Ace.\nThe plot in the game is nothing unexpected. But the way that it's given is pretty darn good. Comic-like cutscenes are really good. You will also hear woman's voice explaining you about the level and telling you what you should do, all during game process.\nBut then you will also have to listen to Bill's voice as well, throwing one-liners, not unlike to main hero of Overdose. Only instead of "Tastes like chicken!" you will be hearing "This... is... madness...". More tolerable though.\n\nSo, what exactly is new? New weapons, new monsters, new levels, new music. So, let's break down.\nNew weapons, well, there is actually only one. It's given at the last two levels and it's like a stronger hack of stakegun. But hey, at least original weapon balance of Painkiller is back, so it's goody. Better than Overdose's mess.\nAs for new enemies, there is only one regular enemy plus final bosses. And that regular enemy is just something lazy, being something tough and throwing fireballs. Oh, wait, it's just Skeleton miniboss from first level of Painkiller with changed skin. And his ragdoll is a complete mess, you will be seeing huge body distroction and hands flapping if you dare to stick any of them to the wall with stake. Plus, there are some enemies reused from Overdose.\n\nBut levels is the biggest change here. And I mean level design mindset. Instead of just being locked in one arena after another, you are free to move around level even when fighting baddies. It goes for open-wolrd-like feel, as there may be two paths to the next part. Locations are huge, there can be dead-ends and there isn't always a checkpoint to hand-guide you. It just manages to strike that feeling of exploration on your own and to be honest, I found it strangely enjoyable, even if there are amateurish part and challenge-reward isn't always done right. But as said, all the "wrongs" of level design, liek dead ends or making player find the next way without much signs, contribute to feeling that you are progressing in this big world yourself, while also somehow not being too mazey either.\nStylistically, it uses the feel and style of the first chapter of Painkiller. Actually, I may be wrong. Remember pre-last level of original game, Monastery? If you do, then you will know what I mean there. And music does an awesome job as well. Ambient is strong and moody. It gives a bit of that lost, despair feel. Something for exploring these foggy lost lands. And fight music has metal or similiar things back to it, being actiony enough, yet still somehow retaining moody feel.\n\nSo what this mod does best is atmosphere and exploration feel.\n\nBut what this mod does bad are pretty much bad things that you expect from amateur mod. As said, challenge-reward balance is screwed. Bosses suck. It's not afraid to be cheap either, as you will often be ambushed by melee enemies spawning right on top of your head. Like, dogs that have explosive barrels on their back. Swarm of hitscan enemies being spawned from every side sometimes. Some encounters with huge enemies, that will either be too easy due to you having freeze ammo on shotgun or else they will eat tons of ammo.\nThat and combat itself isn't good. While each enounter isn't as dragged, I feel that they often were placed as "just to have something". No care about flow or anything.\nNot to mentioning that levels can be too confusing for those who just want more Painkiller and don't like games like Hexen. Not that it reaches Hexen puzzles, but you get it.\n\nAnd well... Bugs bugs bugs. Performance. Loading. And progress-halting bugs. Quacksaves crashes and corrupt saves.\n\nAs for Tarot cards, at least they changed screen to show that you can get only six of them. And then you can equip only one passive and one "to use" card. No, trying to get Tarot Cards by fulfilling whatever objectives in these huge levels in this buggy buggy game is not fun, I just didn't bother.\nAs for demon mode, well, to be honest, it was useful, as you are more likely to get 66 souls without paying attention. Levels here can hold up to 500+ monsters after all. If forget that there is possiblity that game will crash on you.\nOh, yes, and game has few endings. Default one is bad. I doubt that you hate fun so much that you will want to beat game on hardest difficulty. Just check on YouTube or something.\n\nOh, and developers added "cooperative" map at some point. You can launch server and choose it, while keeping game mode as Deathmatch. Technically, I heard that it's unreiable, monsters dissapearing and all, so don't bother. And map itself is just red island in lava sea. Which uses tough enemies non-stop so it'sn ot fun for single player. Not to mentioning that you will just get knocked into air all the time and respawn non-stop. Mess.\n\nPainkiller: Resurrection is a amateur unfinished fan-mod in disguise. Or at least this is the feeling that I get. Sure you can enjoy amateur mods and all. But while there are some nice ideas, technical side flopped completely, making it unenjoyable. Horrible. Messy bugfest.","July 5, 2015","false","7.7"," 35 of 37 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","35","37","0","1"

This game, like many of the other Painkiller extensions first started as a fan project until JoWood decided to fund it with a commercial release in mind. How is Resurrection you might ask. To get right to the point: It's abysmal.\n\nThe game revolves around Bill Sherman, a cold-blooded assassin who apparently gives two ♥♥♥♥♥ about a bus filled with civilians that headed right into his bomb he prepared for the Mafia. Unable to stop the bus, he dies along with the Mafia guys and civilians and ends up in Purgatory, where an angel tells him to defeat Lucifers' henchmen and their armies of demons in order to prevent a war between heaven and hell and to redeem himself. It's a very basic story, which is to be expected. The illustrations for the cutscenes are rather well done, unlike the horrible voiceacting.\n\nThe levels are more open than what we're used to with the original game and Overdose. There is a decent amount to explore and I actually like the idea. However, traversing through these levels can be a chore. You often end up getting stuck in the level geometry, you can't climb up stairs because of how steep most of them are and a lot of enemy encounters happen on very tiny pathways (worst case scenario: on a tall cliff).\n\nSpeaking of enemy encounters: Pacing is decent though there are waves which can drag on for quite a while. Thankfully these are still shorter than the average waves in Painkiller: Redemption. Gunplay stayed the same, but this game has hit detection issues, most noticeable with the Painkiller. There have been numerous times where projectiles seemingly travel through enemies without harming them. While this didn't lead to frustration (thanks to the abundance of ammunition), it did annoy me greatly.\n\nYou know what's funny? When a mod released in 2009, based on a game from 2004 features worse graphics. Resurrection looks horrible. Texture work (not counting reused assets) is really bad, draw distance is pitiful and several GFX are glitched. Unacceptable. I also experienced massive screen tearing which is really unfortunate.\nThe game has serious performance issues. There have been numerous occasions where my framerate would tank down to 10FPS for a second or two. On a GTX980!?! How? And don't get me started on the loading times. It can take up to 30 seconds and longer to load a save. This is a total pace killer and brought my blood to boil. I have never experienced such long loading times in any game before. The music is OK, but nothing that will stick.\n\nI haven't finished Resurrection. I have no desire to finish it. Guess what, I can't even finish this turd because Level 4 is broken. I spawn outside of the map, falling to my doom. And I have no idea how to fix that. Something which really amused me was the plank bridge in Level 3. You can't use that thing, it will kill you because of the Havoc Engine spazzing out. Instead of fixing it, the developers at Homegrown Games set a teleporter to bypass it. This is the most ridiculous thing I have ever seen, period.\n\nPainkiller: Resurrection is ♥♥♥♥ing horrible. Don't waste your time with it.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPainkiller: Resurrection versuchte, das Painkiller-Franchise wiederauferstehen zu lassen, und scheiterte kläglich daran. Dieses Spiel, so wie die meisten Painkiller Add-Ons startete als Fanprojekt, bis JoWood sich entschloss, die Entwicklung zu finanzieren um das Spiel im Nachhinein als Vollpreistitel zu verkaufen. Wie ist Resurrection? Um es auf den Punkt zu brigen: Es ist entsetzlich.\n\nDas Spiel handelt von Bill Sherman, einem kaltblütigen Auftragskiller, der aus unerfindlichen Gründen Mitleid für die Zivilisten empfindet, die in dem Bus sitzen, welcher in die von ihm platzierte Bombe zurast, welche für ein paar Mafiosi bestimmt war. Nicht in der Lage, die Katastrophe abzuwenden, verliert Bill zusammen mit den Zivilisten und Mafiosi sein Leben und landet schließlich im Purgatorium, wo ein Engel ihm mittelt, dass er Luzifers' Handlager und deren Armeen von getreuen Dämonen aufhalten muss um einen Krieg zwischen Himmel und Hölle zu vermeiden, sowie auch um sich selbst zu erlösen. Die Geschichte ist sehr einfach gestrickt, was bei einem Painkiller zu erwarten ist. Die Comiczeichnungen in den Cutscenes sehen sehr nett aus, die Sprachausgabe hingegen lässt einiges zu wünschen übrig.\n\nDie Level sind etwas offener als im Original und Overdose. Es gibt einiges zu entdecken und persönlich gefällt mir diese Idee sehr gut. Allerdings gestaltet sich das Erkunden der Levels als aüßerst nervig. Es kommt öfter vor, dass man sich in der Levelgeometrie verfangt, dass einem das Treppensteigen aufgrund der großen Steigungen sehr schwer fällt und man von Gegnerhorden auf extrem schmalen Wegen überrascht wird (im schlimmsten Fall über einer Klippe).\n\nApropos Gegner: Der Spielflüß bzgl. Arenakämpfe hält sich meist im Rahmen mit ein paar Ausnahmen, die Gott sei Dank immer noch kürzer sind als standardsgemäß in Painkiller: Redemption. Das Gunplay bleibt dem Original treu, jedoch hat das Spiel Probleme mit der Hitdetection, was sich vorallem mit dem Painkiller erkennbar macht. Es ist sehr oft passiert, dass meine Projektile scheinbar durch die Gegner passiert sind, ohne aber den geringsten Schaden an ihnen zuzufügen. Dank ausreichend verteilter Munition in den Leveln waren diese Vorkommnisse nie frustrierend.\n\nWisst ihr, was ich lustig finde? Wenn ein im Jahre 2009 veröffentlichter Mod eines Spieles von 2004 diesem von der Grafik her nicht das Wasser reichen kann. Resurrection sieht einfach potthässlich aus. Texturen (mit Ausnahme der wiederbenutzen Assets aus dem Original) sehen nicht gut aus, die Draw Distance ist teilweise erbärmlich und viele Grafikeffekte sind verbuggt. Sowas ist einfach unakzeptabel. Das Spiel leidet zudem an massivem Screentearing.\nResurrection hat große Performanceprobleme. Es ist sehr oft passiert, dass die Framerate für 1-2 Sekunden bis zu 10FPS gesunken ist, trotz meiner GTX980! Ich frage mich, wieso? Und die Ladezeiten, mein Gott die Ladezeiten! Es kann bis zu 30 Sekunden und länger dauern, bis das Spiel einen Speicherpunkt fertig geladen hat. Sowas stört den Spielfluß erheblich und hat bei mir das Blut zum Kochen gebracht. Ich habe im bislang keinen anderen Spiel solch lange Ladezeiten erlebt.\nDie Musik geht in Ordnung, erwartet aber keinen Ohrwurm, der sich in euch festsetzt.\n\nIch habe Resurrection nicht fertiggespielt. Ich habe keine Lust, es fertigzuspielen. Und ich kann diesen Dreck nicht fertigspielen weil das vierte Level nicht funktioniert. Ich spawne außerhalb der Map und stürze ins Verderben. Und ich habe keine Ahnung, wie ich dieses Problem beheben soll. Die Hängebrücke im dritten Level hat michecht amüsiert. Das Ding ist absolut unpassierbar, es tötet den Spieler, weil die Havoc Engine komplett durchdreht. Anstatt die Hangebrücke zu reparieren, setzen die Entwickler von Homegrown Games einen Teleporter um diese zu umgehen. Das ist das lächerlichste was ich je gesehen habe.\n\nPainkiller: Resurrection ist einfach nur scheiße. Verschwendet eure Zeit nicht mit diesem Spiel.","January 10, 2015","false","3.9"," 35 of 40 people (88%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","88","35","40","4","4"

Glitches good too? Excellent, have we got a game for you!\n\nWe've got save game corruption bugs, falling through the map bugs, enemy AI bugs, checkpoint bugs, scripting bugs! We've even managed to add bugs to the process of selecting a tarot card!\n\nYessir, if you enjoy being kicked out of a game and back to your steam library every nearly ten to fifteen minutes, have we got a game for you right here. What's that I hear? Overdose was buggy, you say? Well yes, Overdose was a buggy, slightly unfinished seeming product, glad you noticed. We've managed to more than triple the bugs in that as well as reduce overall stability!\n\nRemember back in the good old days of playing through Painkiller: Overdose when you'd randomly morph into demon mode and it'd boot ya to your desktop? ENJOY THAT EVERY SINGLE TIME YOU MORPH THIS GO-ROUND, FRIENDO!\n\nAnd the level design is unintutive, what with checkpoints that fail to load, enemies spawning on top of each other, on top of you, and on top of a void outside the map! We've got necessary progression points hidden in corners you'd NEVER think to look here, boy howdy!\n\nWhat's that you say? This isn't enough for you? Try a heaping helping of FIRST PERSON PLATFORMING! Yes, the bane of all gamers' existance, the reason nobody liked Xen, good ol' FPS platforming is back, this time in a painkiller game! Nothing goes together like mustard and chocolate cake quite like having to jump up a large spiral staircase very high up with nothing to meet you when you inevitably fail like a fifteen minute load time.\n\nA 15 minute load time that, mind you, will fail to load almost each and every time, simply freezing you on a load screen.\n\nBUT IF YOU'RE STILL NOT IMPRESSED, REMEMBER: Your save games can and will become corrupted for virtually no reason, oftentimes making the game fail to launch and booting you out to your desktop before you even get a chance to see past the main menu!\n\nAll in all, if you don't spend enough time not playing games and not looking at your steam library, highly recommended.\n\nEasily the best rebooting your videogame upwards of twice every 30 minutes simulator on the market today.","June 4, 2014","false","9.2"," 24 of 26 people (92%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","92","24","26","15","0"

It gives the real What-How-Who-Why? feeling.\n\nPros:\nThe level design of the first (weird) and the last level (open-wide overbright depressing). Sorry but that’s all!\n\nCons:\nOnly 6 levels, but don’t think it will be a short fun thingy, not at all! I nearly played it as much time as the whole Black Edition! Why? Beacuse five of the levels are sooooooo big that there is enough space for a mediocre RPG’s whole storytaking. But they are not just big but you don’t even have a clue where to go! The compass that always helped in the previous games are mostly not working (as it seems they only function near a checkpoint), or it just shows a near health item (really, it happened to me!).\nSo the gameplay is: You wander aimlessly in big wide areas or ridiculously hard maze-alikes, sometimes triggering enemy spawns, fight them then toddle further without any clue what to do. The enemy spawns are randomly placed, no chance to find them all. On one of these enormous levels to earn a card you have to kill all mobs, of course i missed a quarter of them. Sometimes you find a checkpoint and you are happy thinking you have found ’The Route’, but soon realize there are more checkpoints when accidentally backtracked because of no directions given and a shortway (again thinking this is ’The Route’) just lead you back there.\nHave to mention here that even if it’s a fan made product (like the mighty Overdose), the several clipping and stucking problems, incomplete areas with missing parts and walk-out-the-map-and-die things are still not acceptable!\nThe new enemies are ugly, some really amorphous, and extremly unbalanced. Most of them are boring easy and some are. . . ehhh: One time i walked into an open area and i’ve been presented with a new chaingun enemy, not one but like twenty. Guess who died . . . 30 times in rapid succession, until i was able to retract somehow with my remaining 4 HP and hide behind a wagon. It took me 20 minutes to clear the area by picking them one by one and of course it costed me again like 30 deaths as the guys use perfect aimbot hitscans.\nOlder Painkillers were famous of that the enemies were in context with the design of the levels and areas they appeared on. In here absolutely nothing. Everything seems randomly thrown into.\nFor the record i was able to earn only one card (first level). Yes, I’m a pretty mediocre player but seeing  how far i was to reach other cards’ requirements i say that’s a joke.\nHere comes the best part: SUICIDAL ENEMIES. Let’s say this is a very unique feature of this product, as i never saw this behavior in other FPSs. It must be connected somehow with the messed up checkpoint system that sometimes (not even rarely) when you approach a new area you see a bunch of puffs meaning the mobs just vaporized themselves. Even better one of the minibosses (or boss? not sure :P) did this to me, really! I was wandered around half-crying in some Gobi Desert size crater when i found a hundred meters high door like wall. I was sure a boss is behind it, but could not open it. Hardened by the hours of playing this game I was a pro at this moment and i knew i have to find some randomly dropped checkpoints to trigger the opening. So i staggered away to hunt for the little red saviours. Periodically checked back and after a while (an hour or so), hurray! it was open. Run through it with readied heavy weaponry but i was only greeted by a big puff and a cutscene began. After it was done i gathered the fair amount of ammunitions around and started shooting at the poor enviroment to lessen my frustration.\nThe protagonist is an idiot for sure. As someone (J.Johnson) in an another review pointed out he (the ’hero’) „calls himself a 'world class killer' blows himself up because he can't read a bus schedule”.\nThe plot itself is chaotic, the conversations tells nothing besides the antipathy between the protagonist and the bosses (but there is no why). Normally i would not care but the big pile of other problems just strengthen this as well. BTW I know i did not see the real ending (again i ’only’??!! played at normal) but i have no intention to play this mess again.\n\n2/10 - Total mess. A wandering for hours FPS.\n\n(Sorry for my English!)","May 9, 2014","false","10.6"," 24 of 31 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","24","31","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wereboar129/recommended/39560/","wereboar129","Wereboar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wereboar129/","3121 products in account","This game is no gem of the Painkiller Series, it is more or less one of the games that could probably rightfully be called a lemon.\n\nGiven there are some things that are good, the game itself isn't - it is a repetition of the original game just with much larger Levels - the first level is huge, as are most of the other levels, and this is causing one of the problems of this game. The loading time also is very "huge" - sometimes you wait for what seems an eternity just to start the level, reloading also takes a lot of time when you die during the level.\n\nThe graphics are as they were in the original Painkiller, but there is not much new about this episode regarding the graphics. The level design is what might also be a great drawback, you are left alone and you will fail - a lot of times just by walking off in the wrong direction or because the level was designed to make the player suffer. A good example is the spiral staircase in the cathedral, another one the chaotic layout of the valley, were you suddenly can't stop a skid and fall into your death. But there are even worse design errors - like the sparsely added new demons and monsters. Off course the huge levels are looking good, but the design errors are unforgiving and regretfully also unforgivable.\n\nThe story starts out nice, in comic style you are told why you are cast into "hell" - but then the game starts and you realize, "Oh, it still is purgatory... Bummer!". It had a lot of potential, which is regretfully left unused. I know some people who love the game as a multiplayer game - but it still is bugging around a lot, and furthermore - the loading time is taking again away a lot of fun for this game.\n\nGraphics: 7/10 (some options have to be customized, especially on some newer cards)\nSound: 6/10 (mostly the old soundtrack, with time it becomes enervating)\nPlayability: 4/10 (This is representing also the loading time and the design errors which can be a mess)\nStory: 5/10 (since this game isn't really making a lot out of the backdrop of the story)\nValue: 3/10 (Even at 9,99 it's too expensive since it isn't living up to the potential - wait till it gets cheap, real cheap)\n\nOverall: 5/10 (This average is a representing my own opinion, the game isn't the best in the painkiller series and as such you could decide if you require it or if you pass and try playing the other games).","November 2, 2014","false","2.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I loved the base game and will probably play it for a long time to come, but I can't say the same for this thing.\n\nSame as with Overdose, Resurrection is a fan made product that later got enough support to get a commercial release. Unfortunately, while Overdose feels well done, has a lot of new content, and few performance issues, Resurrection plays like a Fallout 3 version of the original game. You have all the basic weapons, but the levels are huge and it's full of glitches.\n\nPainkiller has always had little bugs and glitches because it relies on Havok physics so much, but Resurrection just takes the whole thing and makes it way worse. You'll see random flashing boxes on waterfalls, physics-based bridges will spasm uncontrollably, water will reflect inconsistently or not at all, and enemies will sometimes spawn into the floor. You can even have level geometry fail to load and get killed by falling into an endless void. Sometimes bosses even glitch out or get insta-killed on loading. However, the worst performance issue I encountered was huge framerate drops or crazy slowdown, sometimes to the point where I bunny hopped to my death because the game couldn't process a 180 flick of my mouse because it was too busy being slowed to a crawl. It literally made the game unplayable for me. The list of wacky bugs goes on and on.\n\nI like what Resurrection ATTEMPTED to do. It tried to mix up Painkiller by adding a new protagonist and making levels huge and non-linear, so people could explore them. And honestly, I like those new concepts. It's just that the game is too buggy. If there's an unofficial patch ANYWHERE to fix this game's glaring performance issues, it could be good. As it stands, This is so far the only painkiller game I just can't finish.","November 18, 2015","false","2.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

After this moving testimony, ask for their thoughts on Painkiller: Resurrection and recoil in horror as all emotion abandons them and the blood drains from their face, leaving behind a vacant and pale visage while they recount sickening tales of a game permeated with bugs, crashes, dull levels that confusingly branch out and twist on for miles; giving the illusion of freedom, when really every path except one leads to dead ends, more bugs, crashes, pointless excursions with no reward. Ceaseless enemy hordes that offer no challenge, consume exorbitant amounts of time and spawn inside of the walls, the floors, the ceilings, and every other nook and cranny, so long as it isn't in the playable space. Scouring for ammo constantly, in order to defeat bosses possessing a ridiculous number of health points, who never hit you once because the developers forgot to program in some decent AI. As more and more energy is expended detailing the atrocities of Painkiller: Resurrection, you can feel your soul gradually leaving your body and you have to end the tirade.

I got this game when there was a special pre-order bonus with Painkiller, Its expansion, and Overdose. I knew this game was going to be bad... just look at the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ trailer for it.\n\nI am serious; Go look at it.\n\nDid you watch it? See how great the affects were? I want you to guess how much funding this game had been given.\n\nFor a lack of better words, this game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  It got no hype, no advertising, and no qualities. The expansion for PK and Overdose actually added new stuff to the game's mindless shooty fun. Resurrection simple does its name: It revives the original Painkiller, but as a stagnate cadaver that makes games like Metro 2033 look awesome.\n\nIf this game were free, I'd recommend brushing your teeth instead.\n\n\n.....Oh and the guy on the cover doesn't look like the guy in the game if I remembered right.","July 5, 2011","false","0.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I really enjoyed the new, bigger maps with lots of enemies to defeat, and with a huge variety of ways  you can use to engage the enemy. Storyline is also good and well defined, with cool comic-like cutscenes that pretty much explain everything you're doing.\n\nOn the other hand, enemy AI isn't great, and they always try to mass attack you and eventually they always gets stupidly stuck somewhere before reaching you. Also there are some medium bugs that can prevent you from going foward on the map, but you can get over them if frustration doesn't beat you first.\n\nAnyway if the part you enjoy the most about FPS games is the amount of enemies to kill and you like them with a little taste of horror, this one won't disapoint you for sure. It's a 6/10 for me.","January 25, 2014","true","18.5"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","6","14","0","0"

As the only painkiller game, this is really a true simulator of hell.. long loading times, approximately a 3 minutes, frustrating level design, where you have to jump through bad placed textures, and one bad jump leads to game over, or at least 50+-HP down.. some mobs also deal damage as if you were playing on the hardest difficulty while you play on the easiest.. and sometimes enemies (even bosses) just explode and die without any specification about what caused that.. good thing is, if you dont like to fight some types of enemies, or u dislike the arena you are currently fighting at, this painkiller doesnt force you to kill all enemies, you can simply run through the level, and if u run away far enough, the mobs will despawn and its solved.. i also like the "non-linear" design of levels.. u can go wherever you want, but be careful, if u see textures disappearing in front of your eyes, you better go back, or else youll be stucked in the place even worse than the hell, which is the bug between textures.. and what about new content ? One new enemy two "new" bosses (on of them has the exact moveset and attacks like that one new enemy and second is reskined alastor from original game), and one new weapon, with extremely OP primary fire, and extremely useless and bugged secondary fire.. and thats all.. and you know what ? i think this is a great simulation of hell or that idiotic purgatory at which this game takes place.. if i take it that way, and if i exclude the last level, which simulated hell maybe too much and was frustrating as ♥♥♥♥, i can say, that i had tons of fun with this game, because if i just reminded myself, that this game is meant to be serious, i just really had to laugh and thats the purpose of games isnt it ?","November 9, 2014","true","6.9"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","5","12","0","0"

Some levels are open - unlike other Painkiller locations you're not forced to basically walk through narrow linear corridor without ability to backtrack, and can freely roam around the big location. This part of the game is executed brilliantly - such locations are very interesting to explore, and it's a huge pleasure to discover the landmarks.\n\nEach level has unique memorable features - magnificent architecture, dark part and stairway to Heaven of the Cathedral, amazing variety of locations and buildings in Haunted City and Forgotten Valley, nice industrial scenery and cool fight against whole army of enemies with new strong weapon in Hangar, depressing atmosphere of Dry Sea, stunning vistas of Gloomy Mountains and Tower of Power. In the mountains I didn't notice a single tiling texture, which is very impressive considering the fact that this engine clearly isn't megatexture-wielding IdTech5.\n\nFans of standard Painkiller game type won't be deprived - two levels are in classic style where the player follows a linear path and is blocked by slabs during battle.\n\nOn top of that - story which features very entertaining witty dialogues.\n\nAnd don't think that it's going to be too short. Even though there are only six levels, for the most of them each one is as long as 4-5 regular Painkiller levels, and variety of the design ensures that it won't feel like you're stuck in the same decorations for too long time either.\n\nIt's too bad that this game didn't reach its full potential due to JoWood publisher who forced the developers to release it too soon. It's amazingly entertaining how it is, and with more levels, more new weapons and monsters it would definitely become the best part of Painkiller series.","December 28, 2014","true","23.1"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","1","4","0","0"

Of course leave it to Homegrown Games to step up to the plate in that regard. While it has less levels than the first two games, it makes up for this with massive landscapes and multiple ways of completing the level. A smart idea I feel that definitely keeps the series fresh. The storyline is emotional and awesome, as you play William "Bill" Sherman, who must navigate purgatory after committing an atrocity that haunts his memory. Bill is a tortured man but, unlike Belial and Daniel, understands his place in the script of things and fights simply because he must, not because of any other ulterior motive.","January 20, 2015","true","5.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Ever. Don't be tempted by the "fan made project" tag, from what i can gather the only painkillers the fans involved in this project were familiar with are more than likely illegal to possess. The level design is farsical and much of the game looks like it was made by a stoned priest in an community editing program. Oh and for some reason, unbeknownst to mankind, the control key has been remapped to the shotguns primary fire as opposed to the melee weapons alt, which is 15x more useful. I was too busy being furious at the game to try and remap the key. I think i tried once and you cant change the weapons key map layout, which wouldn't be that much of a problem but the weapon order changes every ♥♥♥♥ing game. Oh and the weapons are all pretty much the same as from the original painkiller (and by pretty much i mean exactly the ♥♥♥♥ing same) only the weapon key mapping layout is different for some reason.
