But it makes quite fun.\nMostly 4 players play in small arenas with or without some obstacles for the win (arena chooses randomly). It has several game modes like deathmatch, last man standing and capture the flag. You can distinguish the players by color. Each player starts with 5 shoots which will be reloaded after time. The bullets fly around unless they hit someone or each other. Ofc there are some little AI issues but they didn't disturb me much. Also you cannot quit a match in the middle. You join the arena by space and add the bots by return. Thankfully the dev added those bots lately because practically the MP is dead. But now you can do all achievements with them. It's an entertaining game for one or two hours.\n\nGameplay Video - Last Man Standing\nhttps://youtu.be/_0dI4WG9jUQ","August 13, 2015","true","1.7"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","15","20","3","0"

You can shoot up to 5 bullets at the same time which bounce off the walls to kill your opponent (or yourself).\n\nAn indie multiplayer game like this often comes with the problem of finding enough players to play with. "Butsbal" is no exception to that problem, you either need a few people at home to play with (and the equipment obviously) or try to arrange some people online to play with. The game does not come with any bot support so if you are like me and you haven't got any friends you are not able to play this game (unless you want to play with yourself ;) ).\n\nOverall the game seems fun to pass some time and it's fairly cheap but I can't recommend this game simply because of the lack of players (bots) and content.","September 20, 2015","false","0.2"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","1"

It is not a bad game at all but needs some attention.\n\n1. Game doesn't have very good gamepad support. You can get through some menus with controller but you cant restart or go back to menu after a round. Also with my xbox one controller to add bots it says to use select unfortunatly select doesn't work but.. left stick button does add bots.\n\n2. My second complaint is a bit more major.. exiting a game once already in a match... it doesnt allow it. I think alt f4 works.\n\n3. Can't choose color of box/player icon thingy. also can't make profiles or add a name to your bot in local mp.\n\n4. Not sure if you can even select the 3 diff maps manually or if they just rotate randomly. A few more maps would help... I don't think it would be that difficult, yet I am by far no means a game maker/developer lol.\n\nThe good is it has several different game modes and the capture the flag mode is fun even with just 2 players. Can't wait to try it local with 4 players. It has online multiplayer and overall its pretty fun playing with others. For all the negatives that I mentioned the short while I played it with a friend online was fun so I do recommend this game. Fun is what its all about.","July 12, 2015","true","3.0"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

The maps are simply too small for the amount of balls flying around. Capture the Flag in particular is an absolute nightmare due to the necessity of going over to the opponent's side and back without dying. The hitboxes are also somewhat buggy; I spent a solid 10 seconds walking through and around my flag, trying to get the game to register that I had scored a point.","September 2, 2015","false","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, it would definitely benefit from a couple more maps, player customisation and more responsive controller support (not to mention lack of options in setting up certain gametypes, i.e. time/score limits). It would also be much appreciated to have a pause menu in-game, rather than having to force quit out.\n\nThat aside, works well as a local multiplayer time filler, but does feel like you're just fullscreening something off miniclip.","July 26, 2015","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Woo for that! Anyways, the game has very simple looks and very simple gamemodes. Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Flag and Last Man Standing I think. The bullets you fire bounce around like crazy and they won't stop until they come back to you or magically hit someone else. Or hit another bullet. The game has few different maps, bullets love to bounce on all of them. All in all, you probably won't get that much out of this game, but the time you will squeeze out will be most likely worth it.
