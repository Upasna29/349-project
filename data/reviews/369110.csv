"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/369110/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2818 products in account","The Swindle is a stealth based rogue-like heist game, being developed by Size Five Games and releasing in July 2015.  The game can be related to a combination of Spelunky and Payday of sorts.\n\nGameplay premise is simple, break into a house and rob as much money as you can whilst remaining hidden from guards and avoiding traps. You have 100 days to reach your goal of running a final heist run called “The Swindle” on a police station. The 100 days counts down each time you complete a heist. In between each heist you are able to upgrade your skills, equipment and purchase access to the next stage of stages.  All of your purchases stick with you right until the end, so it doesn’t matter if you die or get caught on one character, as you will just get a new one with the same skill set as before. This is my favourite aspect of any rogue-like as it always feels like you are progressing.  In each building, you will come across a variety of enemies and traps, such as mines and electric fences, and flying bots that will shoot you if you get close. You have one ability to attack said enemies, but it isn’t always easy enough to get close to them to be able to kill them.  After a couple of heists collecting smaller sums of money, you will need to upgrade your skills in hacking; this allows you to hack computers and disable traps and use them against your foes. The hacking side of the game has its own mini-game of sorts as you have to follow the QTEs on screen in order to complete a hack, fail and you will probably find your self-splattered all up the wall.\n\nThe Swindle’s art style is very steam punky. The blacks and browns suite the setting very well and lighting is also a key part of any stealth game; whilst it is only basic lighting it does its job very well. Animation of your character and enemies is really well done too, with some really smooth and fluid movements to be seen when you are jumping from wall to wall Spiderman style. Whilst the game isn’t voice acted, the sound effects are nicely done, with a lot of focus being put on the amount of sound your character makes to try and catch you out by being heard by a guard, the footstep sounds are probably the best effect in this game.\n\nThis is a really difficult game. Even the first stage of heists is really difficult and you really need to take every move you make into serious consideration. Do you break through this window now or is there a better way? Do I try and take out this guard so I don’t have to worry about him on the way out or shall I try and sneak past? Every action you take in this game will have consequences later on in the level.  The skills and equipment choices you make throughout the run will also have a huge impact as to how you play out the later levels of the game.  The last heist on the police station is essentially what the whole game comes down too, in order to unlock the last heist you have to have unlocked every other stage and have a spare £400k sitting around. If you fail the last heist either by dying or being caught, you have to make £400k again, this is often absolutely detrimental to your run as it can take about three or four heists to make that money again. If you are getting close to the last few days of your run, it will often mean failure.\n\nAs each run lasts can last anywhere between 80 and maybe a little bit more than a 100 days (you can purchase an upgrade that gives you more time), and this will take about an hour each depending on how quick you are on the heists. There is a very high replay ability factor for this game though, and one that I will certainly be keeping installed just because of the random factors you get thrown at you.  I managed to complete The Swindle on my third run and even then it was down to the last day or two of the time limit, so you really have to plan your steps carefully.\n\nI played the game with a controller, and I didn’t have any problems controlling the game whilst carrying out the heists, I did however have a little of trouble navigating the menu screens and skills purchasing screens, it doesn’t seem to respond very well to the joysticks motions and had to opt to using the directional pad instead, minor issue though. There are a couple of graphical options you can change, but this game shouldn’t be taxing to any computer nowadays.\n\nThe thing that grabbed me initially with The Swindle would be the art style, and that remains one of the best parts of this game. Once you get past the surface of what seems to be a very samey style game to that of Spelunky, you actually have a really in-depth stealth based game that you will find sucking hours of time out of you. The high replay ability factor really pays off for this type of game, making the retail price of £11, 99 a real steal of a buy.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tgr1/recommended/369110/","tgr1","Kelly Osbourne","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tgr1/","436 products in account","The Swindle is a difficult game, make no mistake about it. Sometimes the difficulty stems intentionally from its design, and at other times it's due to kinks inherent to the way it was designed. Over the course of 100 in-game days you'll sneak, steal, clobber and die your way across a Victorian Steampunk interpretation of London, on a mission to thwart the government's ultimate surveillance tool. Fail and you'll be forever out of the thieving game, succeed, though, and you'll be free to rob from the rich, the poor and whoever else you come across.\n\n\nHaving caught word that Johnny Law is introducing aforementioned all-seeing surveillance technology known as "The Devil's Basilisk" you and your band of thieves resolve to steal it. However, you'll have no chance of infiltrating the Basilisk if you and your crew have no working capital - you've got to start at the bottom to get to the top after all.\n\nStarting in the slums, you'll break into people's homes to steal their savings - you won't make a killing, but the money you earn will help you buy the upgrades required to pull off more daring and dangerous jobs.\n\nJust like Spelunky, each level you visit has been procedurally generated, meaning you'll never know what's coming next.\n\nMoney bags, robotic steampunk guards, banking computers, surveillance cameras and other devious traps will always be in different places, keeping you on your toes . Rushing in for the steal is never the best option - it's still viable, but never as rewarding.\n\nTypically, levels play out in the same fashion:\n\n*Survey the building from all angles\n*Identify surveillance points and enemies\n*Find where the cash and computers are\n*Plan escape route\n\nI found myself using the above formula throughout The Swindle, to varying degrees of success.\n\nEnemies each have their own field of vision, breach it and the alarms will go off and the police will shortly be on the scene. Cue erratic music as you attempt to batter enemies, drain the cash from computers using a button-mashing QTE, and then make your way back to your escape pod. You'll face stiff resistance from the coppers as they sweep the building, and ocassionally crash through it in their airship.\n\nIf you fail a day will pass and another thief will take your place, succeed, however, and you'll return to your airship with bags of loot.\n\nIn the early stages of the game I found myself stuck in a vicious losing cycle :\n\n*Identify cash\n*Identify enemies\n*Identify cash I can't reach because I don't have the prerequisite skills.\n*Trip alarm.\n*Die.\n\nI was stuck in that loop for longer than I'd like to admit, a fact that made me resent the game's core design ever so slightly.\n\nThe beginning stages reward your skill with only paltry amounts of cash, a mechanic which brought me great displeasure. To afford even the most basic upgrades you'll need to successfully drain each stage of as much cash as you can. No easy feat given the lack of a tutorial.\n\nBe it intentionally or unintentionally, The Swindle dangles larger cash payoffs in front of you, despite your inability to reach them. Fortunately, acquiring the hacking skill and a handful of bombs changes things for the better, allowing you a degree of freedom in how you approach things.\n\nNew challenges and enemies constantly shake things up, and you'll need to alter the way you play accordingly if you want to relieve your victims of 100% of their cash.\n\nThe game expands significantly as you acquire more loot. Enemies become faster and more abundent, security fixtures like cameras and drones appear, and more possibilities for mischief present themselves. The Swindle never closes a door without opening a window, so to speak. Likewise, your squad of master thieves also get an upgrade with better hacking abilities, stronger attacks, more bombs and jumping skills. It's up to you where you put your hard-earned (!) money.\n\nSometimes it doesn't matter what upgrades you have though, the game, by its very nature, can be completely unfair. On more than a few occasions I found myself completely unable to access computers due to there being either traps below or exploding/spiky enemies that kill on touch. Your experience may differ, but the game's procedural generation may require some fine-tuning.\n\nWhen I wasn't tossing my controller across the room out of pure frustration, I was having a great time. Once you have breached The Swindle's tough outer shell it comes into its own. With a few upgrades on board you'll be ducking, diving and robbing your way from the slums, to luxury stately homes. Extracting the stealth gameplay of Stealth Inc and injecting it into Spelunky is the closest comparison I can give, and it works exceptionally well.\n\nThe simple gameplay loop of stealing, upgrading and moving on to the next location to pull off even bigger heists was compelling enough to keep me returning for more, even when I wasn't doing too good. The promise of a shiny new toy to play with, and the resultant evolution of each level, meant I never got bored, even when I felt the game wasn't being entirely fair.\n\nIf you can forgive its minor issues The Swindle is sure to make off with a little piece of your heart.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nReviewed with a promotionsal copy.

They're extremely sluggish - sometimes the game will not register that you've jumped, and you'll just walk into a spike pit. There doesn't seem to be an easy way to 'drop' when clinging to a wall, and trying to jump off of a wall and attack fails to trigger pretty often. It's also hard to tell whether you can actually access an area with your current abilities - can I jump high enough to grab this wall? Not sure. The difference is only a few pixels, so sometimes I feel like I can grapple onto something, and other times I can't.\n\nIf the control issues get fixed, I would definitely recommend. Right now though, I can't.","July 28, 2015","false","0.7"," 149 of 220 people (68%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","68","149","220","7","13"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fadedreality/recommended/369110/","fadedreality","FadedReality","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fadedreality/","896 products in account","The Swindle is a game about taking things that don’t belong to you. You enter a randomly generated level, try to get through without being seen, and get out with as much cash as you can carry. You don’t have to get it all, but you get a sizable bonus if you do. If you die, you lose your cash and the thief you were using and get no second chance at that map. You use that cash on a variety of upgrades like more map information, more jumps, faster hacking, bombs, access to harder map types, and smoke screens, to name a few. You get 100 days, each representing an attempt to earn enough cash to get up to the titular highest and hardest map type. 100 days might seem like a lot of time but when an attempt can less than 30 seconds if you slip up or get impatient, it starts to feel more like a doomsday clock.\n\nThe Swindle is hard. Not cheap, not random, just hard. It will punish you swiftly and severely for impatience or poor decision making. It’s hard, but not unfair.\n\nEvery single one of my several hundred deaths were my fault. I jumped too soon, I tried to squeeze in one more hit even when I knew my melee attack had a small cooldown, or I tried to overextend myself in my greed to get all the cash in a level.\n\nNew enemy types and map features are introduced with minimal tutorials, keeping the flow of the game intact and the sense of discovery a reward for the player's efforts. When you buy clearance to visit the second map type, you better have hacking level 2 or you might not even get into the building as locked doors are now a thing. You better have bombs by the third map type because some of the best loot will be sealed behind a wall. The rewards are exponentially greater as is the potential for failure.\n\nUnlike most games that get easier as you get more tools, The Swindle responds in kind with challenges that force you to utilize those tools in split second decisions and ups the skill ceiling. If you like games that constantly challenge you from start to finish, this one is for you.","August 1, 2015","true","13.3"," 38 of 46 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","38","46","2","0"

For a platformer thats about stealth and sneaking around, the controls need to be super tight and responsive (see Mark of the Ninja for an excellent example of good controls). The controls in The Swindle are neither tight nor responsive. There's a bit of "floatyness" to the jumping, and it's too difficult to tell at which point on a ledge the wall-slide will trigger. If it doesn't trigger, then your in-game avatar likes to jump up-and-4-feet-over the edge for some inexplicable, infuriating reason. It is a real shame, because there's a good game here, marred by bad control responsiveness. Even navigating the menus using an Xbox360 controller is harder than it should be.\n\nThe Art Style is FantasticThis is a good looking 2D game, for sure. I really like the steampunk-meets-Victorian-era-London art direction. There's some CRT scanline effects that are fitting for the overall aesthetic, but not overused. The player protagonist and enemies all look good IMO. My only complaint in the graphics department is the visual arc that's represented in the animation of your melee swing. You don't always hit what your avatar's weapon goes across (if an enemy is above or below you for example), even though visually it looks like you made contact.\n\nSummaryA good platformer will make your character's deaths feel like your own fault. The Swindle doesn't feel like that at all. I've died wayyyy too many cheap deaths that were caused by a control scheme that's just not up to par for this type of game. I've been spotted by enemies that should never have had a chance to see me not through lack of skill, but because my character didn't move in a way that you would naturally expect him/her to. It's truly frustrating, because this could be a real gem of a game were the controls better. Hopefully the developer(s) can improve upon this aspect of The Swindle. Until that happens however, I can't recommend purchasing it.","August 6, 2015","false","8.6"," 51 of 70 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","51","70","0","4"

Gameplay (for the most part) is fun, and while difficult and frustrating, is addicting.  I found myself rage-quitting and then reopening the game for another go.\nHOWEVER, the controls are sluggish and on a platformer in general this is rough enough, but on the forums I saw the dev mention (http://steamcommunity.com/app/369110/discussions/1/535151589902560428/#p2) that the controls are deliberately a bit off at the beginning until you buy certain upgrades.  This is unacceptable to me and an artificial difficulty.  I'm quite bad at platformers, and I can fail well enough on my own, thank you.  I don't need intentionally slow/unresponsive controls to help me along.","July 28, 2015","false","3.0"," 126 of 199 people (63%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","63","126","199","13","40"

Playing the role of a masterthief you hear word of an artificial intelligence device Scotland Yard is planning to deploy. Once deployed this device will bring complete surveillance along with ending your career and retirement plans. Considering it's stealth game from a developer who openly admits they dislike the genre, could have fooled me. Maybe it was a ruse? :)\n\nExpands well starting with simple heists in the Slums district that doesn't involve more then dodging a few guards and picking up cash laying about the place (who does that!?). Gradually introducing new mechanics and smarter robots that quickly required both your platforming skills and wits. End goal is to stop the AI deployment which happens after 100 days. Heists use 1 day but if that sounds like a problem or you feel rushed, do have the ability to spend cash on increasing the timeframe.\n\nOther primary goal of course is to increase your chances of success. Banking cash from successful heists can be spent on a range of upgrades, from simple double jumps to backpack steamjets that conceal the thieves presence momentarily. Character abilities can also purchased which included hacking tools, lockpicks, goggles that increase your general perception, bombs for blasting through walls and more. Progress to new zones is made by purchasing security clearance cards. Zones were uniquely themed and given the procedural nature levels designed quite well. Can't say I ran into any 'broken rooms' in my gametime and while most had familiar characteristics didn't feel like I had "Ben There, Dan That!"\n\nGraphically the game is beautiful, supporting up to 4k+ screen resolution along with having options to disable the blur, sunrays and otherwise which should mean decent performance on most systems. Would recommend a gamepad but kb+mouse was responsive and completely remappable. Overall I can see myself spending hours playing The Swindle.

Well, in The Swindle it does but its DAMN hard to pull off! In The Swindle you have one simple task, steal as much you can and get away with it. Between you and your shiny cash is a arsenal of defense bots and cameras, mines, etc. The problem? You don't start out with much at all. Armed with a trusty club, you must claw your way up slowly and arm yourself by spending the hard earned cash you stole. On top of all that you only have 100 days(100 lives/heists) to beat the game. All the elements of The Swindle work well, the graphics, the overall theme, the abilities, the music. The problem lies in the one core mechanic of this game. The Roguelike nature of this game is extremely unforgiving and downright unfair at times, placing defenses and traps in areas that simply cannot be overcome, Either due to lack of ability or placement. The early game is perpetuated with this type of problem and it isn't exactly gently explained through tutorials, because there really isn't any. The game gets better after you have collected quite a few of your gizmos/abilities but you always feel like your in a race to keep up with timer/enemy. Which once those 100 days are up, its back to the beginning.

It touches on the same feedback loop of learning that Spelunky did to earn my love.

But if you're the type of person who won't be frustrated by losing at the last second, and rather see it as an opportunity to improve, this game will reward that behavior.\n\nIt's not without "flaws", of course, but certain idiosyncrasies can give something like this personality.

It has a nice aesthetic, accepts some failure, and has a pleasant feeling of momentum once you become good enough to consistantly correct for mistakes.

The Swindle requires patience, timing and skill. Traits that I am sadly lacking. But I am learning. I'm getting better.\n\nThe Swindle is a steam punk accidental death simulator in which you guide a motley crew of thieves to their inevitable demise, and each death is more hilarious or frustrating than the last. Your mileage may vary.\n\nThe overarching goal is to steal the Devil's Basilisk, an omniscient survellaince device that Scotland Yard are planning to activate in 100 days time. Each time you venture out on a heist, the doomsday clock ticks ever closer to game over. Why yes, you can actually fail in the Swindle, and many of you will do so on your first run.\n\nEach day you will go to work, statrting off in The Slums, pilfering money from the poor London folk until you acquire enough upgrades, skills and forged documents to take on richer, and more secure locations such as casinos and banks.\n\nThe procedurally generated levels ensure that you'll never burgle the same establishment twice, although you will start to see general themes and patterns in the level layouts, every heist is a fresh and unique challenge. For the most part, the rules of each level are laid out in front of you, the enemy's fields of vision and capabilities are clear to see at a glance. Patrol patterns are consistant, and security cameras scan specific areas with precise timing. Patience is key to progression, watching for a weakness that you can exploit and then doing so will net you consistant rewards.\n\nInterestingly, some levels may even be impossible depending on the upgrades you have acquired thus far, I'll get into upgrades a little later, but it's a very real possibility that you will be unable to 100% many levels in the game if you are not prepared for every single eventuality.\n\nIt's a risky design choice from Dan Marshall, but it highlights the problems that you will face throughout your financial reallocation career and encourages you to delve into the progression system and have a good look for tools that may help you out in the future. It also teaches you a very important lesson: Abandonning a heist is very much part of this game, in fact it is as much a part of The Swindle as any mechanic or feature.\n\nYour thieves are not warriors, one hit, one mistake, and they are dead. Risking a gauntlet of guards, landmines and spike traps to hack one more terminal may not be worth it. Grab what you can and get out alive and the multiplier is integral to this.\n\nFor every successful heist your score multipler will increase and this nets you a juicy cash bonus at the end of every level. The more successful heists, the higher the multiplier so sooner or later you'll reach a stage where you really REALLY don't want to die. The Swindle makes you care about the lives of you little tea leaves and the exponential increase of risk/reward is the reason for this. It's a stroke of genius. Giving in to the temptation of hacking one more terminal is potentially fatal, but if it's a casino terminal worth £50k and then combine that with a triple multiplier... it's awfully tempting isn't it? Just bear in mind that carelessness and greed are your bigest enemies in The Swindle.\n\nThe problem for me however, is than in games especially, I am careless and I am greedy. I want ALL the things and even now, will try and clean out a level whether it's a good idea or not and I believe the this game has been constructed to deliberately punish gamers with that kind of impulsive habit. I love the Swindle I really do, but not necessarily when I'm in the same room as it. Sometimes I do have to literally walk away or switch to playing something more forgiving. Like Dark Souls.\n\nLuckily, there are several abilities & tools to mitigate one's incompetance. You can unlock multiple jumps, the ability to cling to walls, a remote detonator for mines, dynamite to blast through walls and EMP device and much, much, more. There is an incredible depth in how much you characters can improve. Luckily, your upgrades carry one from one hapless thief to another as I dont think I could take having a thief with £500k investment in him getting eviscerated by a robotic Bobby.\n\nAh yes, and that brings me to the police. No, not the godawful band with Sting in, I'm talking about London's robotic law enforcement. Normally when you get spotted in a stealth game, that's it time to restart, in The Swindle the game turns into a frantic platformer where everything is trying to murder you adn you have to get out before the cyberfuzz turn up and REALLY make your life a misery. Or do you have a couple of seconds spare to grab a few extra quid on the way out?\n\nThe way the music kicks up a notch when you are spotted is delicious, as is the music in general. The score really is excellent and you can see for yourself how gorgeous the art is in this game.\n\nThe Swindle is like a splinter in my head, I find myself constantly thinking about it like on the next run Ill do this differently or I'll prioritise these skills. It's infectious and magnificent in equal measure. It is something rather special indeed and scrathes that "just one more run" itch perfectly.\n\nIn conclusion then, I really, really, really, want to buy Dan Marshall a pint.","August 4, 2015","true","10.2"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","15","20","2","0"

Which is disappointing because I really, really like this game. I love the setting, the music, and the design. Please bear in mind that these problems I'm having are, for the most part, subjective.\n\nFirst, the controls are not as responsive as you would need for this genre. Comparing it something like Spelunky, Super Meat Boy, or Mark of the Ninja this game, unfortunately, does not come close. Which brings me to my second point.\n\nYou don't have much control over your character. For instance, you cannot control your jump height when you're either clinging or sliding down a wall. This is incredibly important when trying to take out enemies that have been generated in an area that's difficult to get to. Sometimes the jump will accidentally put you in front of a window sounding the alarm. The controls, I feel, is the biggest hurdle for me to get over.\n\nThe randomly generated levels can be irritating. I've experienced mission 1 that does not yield enough money to get the hacking skill. This skill is what will net you most of your money in the early game and is an imperative skill to have. On more than one occasion, without being able to see the entire layout of the building in the early game, if you don't have the double jump, a triple window can really screw you over and force you to terminate your current employee and losing your XP bonus. To mitigate this, however, you could get bombs. Again, these are subjective complaints.\n\nLastly, I don't like that there is instant death from fall damage. Personally, I don't think this is something that's needed in this platformer, but hey, I'm not the developer.\n\nIf you do decide to buy this game, regardless, make sure you get hacking from day one. Be careful with your jump. Learn how it works and what you can do to work around it in order for you to be successful in your heists. Take your time to understand the enemies' pathing. Find the right cycle to strike and remember to be patient.\n\nTL;DR - wait until you hear about an update outlining a "fix" for the controls or if they address something about their random generation.","August 17, 2015","false","43.7"," 22 of 34 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","22","34","0","0"

I had no issues in that vein.  I beat the game using the keyboard.  The default controls worked just fine.  I had 2 or 3 failed campaigns where I figured out the potential of the abilities and an effective strategy.\n\nThis isn't a game where you conjure up some some controller wizardry and defeat highly complex situations.  It's a game where you figure out how to not have to do that sort of thing in the first place.  There are the sticky situations of course, but that’s why you buy the abilities.\n\nThere's no time limit to the stages themselves.  There's no rush to blaze through a level so quick.  This game is a test of patience and nerve, not necessarily your prowess behind a controller.  The game rewards meticulous planning and opportunistic play, not courage.  You are a thief after all (or, probaby a series of thieves by the time you're done).","August 1, 2015","true","49.1"," 16 of 24 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","16","24","0","0"

The exciting, tense gameplay draws you in and the somewhat unique risk/reward system is very compelling. The proceduarally generated levels ensure infinite replayability and are challenging, but sometimes generate inaccessable rooms or spawn things in such a way as to make the room impossible to traverse. The Swindle is an exciting, tense, difficult, beautiful stealth platformer.\n\nThis is all ruined by the controls.\n\nThe controls are abysmal. In games like Mark of the Ninja, controls and actions are pixel-perfect. You know exactly what will happen when you press those buttons. In The Swindle, you do not. Will I grip onto that wall? Will I make the jump in time for the guard to not see me? Will I be able to jump down there? Will the wall slide work this time? These are questions that I cannot answer. I have genuinely seen internet flash platformers with more useable and responsive controls. It makes me very sad to say that, because this game could have been one of my favourite games this year. It's a terrible, terrible shame that things are this way, because if this game had Mark of the Ninja's controls it would be truly exceptional.\n\nAlso, no mouse control in any menus.

It presents you with obstacles and challenges that require specific gear to overcome (gear which you probably won't have when you first encounter them), never tells you how exactly you screwed up, and on top of that includes a ticking clock mechanic that as of my fifth attempt at the campaign has made it impossible to win the game proper.\n\nOn top of that, your thief's lack of a health bar makes it impossible to track damage-over-time things, or things that I believe are damage-over-time things as shortly after they happen my thief will drop dead for no reason at all.\n\nAnd now the Top 5 Reasons Why You and I Died in The Swindle:\n\n5) Miscalculated how long that drop was and fell to your death.\n4) The police hovercraft dropped in and deus ex machinegunned your sorry ♥♥♥.\n3) Miscalculated how far a jump would take you and subsequently got spotted and clubbed to death (meaning hit once).\n2) Some enemy feature which you were not aware would result in your death resulted in your death.\n1) Elroy Blues' word for "lies" when discussing them with his brother Jake (see "The Blues Brothers" for details; great flick).\n\nI kid you not, this game keeps inventing new and creative ways to royally screw you over, from blowing up a security console that you thought your bomb was far enough from to not touch, to putting enemies with ridiculous lines of sight on a single block so they keep going back and forth with no way to effectively deal with them, to enemies killing you when you swung first at point-blank. The game's lack of tutorial on the controls and enemies means that you'll also encounter many, MANY things that will take two or three deaths for you to fully figure out how they work, and since the game only gives you 100 heists to make money from before Game Over, those are deaths you cannot afford to have happen to you. I'd think that as the Master Thief that you are (as declared by the opening text) you would've done your homework on these kinds of things so at least you'd go in knowing what you're up against.\n\nBut you don't. This game takes a lot of bad cues from Dark Souls 2, from the ticking clock ultimatum to the lack of any significant amount of health to the heavy penalization for dying when dying is the only way you can effectively gauge what enemies do and how they can kill you. If any one of these issues were addressed, particularly the latter two, I would probably enjoy the game a lot more.

But fun.\n•	Procedurally generated levels; not really a roguelike but had a lot of RPG flair to it\n•	Start from the ground up; sneak around and steal the cash needed to buy upgrades in order to pull of heists in more challenging maps for bigger rewards\n•	Levels change as you replay them and do amp up in difficulty on subsequent playthroughs.\n•	If you don't make it back to your airship (yes, airship) alive you lose any money you found in a level.  There are no rewards for failure to be found in The Swindle.\n•	Unique randomized characters - If you fail a mission your prior character is "terminated" and replaced with a new one.  There is no loss of your already purchased upgrades.\n•	Upgrades are useful and can be quite expensive.  You really earn your way up the ability ladder in this game. (*ahem* Buy the $100.00 Hack upgrade first)\n•	Over 50 skills and tools to upgrade each with different prices\n•	You start out being able to blackjack cops when their backs are turned.  If they catch you with their flashlight the alarm goes off and you have to bail.\n•	Falling to far and dying is a very, very real threat.\n•	You have 100 "days" (Mission attempts) to complete the last heist AKA. "The Swindle" but you have to work through the first 5 missions and earn clearance to get there\n•	You can get in an inescapable situation.  If you fall into a room and can't double jump out because you lack that ability, for example. The only option is to self-terminate and start the next day with a new thief.\n•	Sometimes the procedurally generated levels are a little... weird.  This part of the game could use some fine tuning and it could be great.\n•	Would be nice if the skill tree showed skills you could afford as the menu is difficult to navigate.\n\nGraphics:\n•	The main appeal of this game is it's art direction and setting.  Everything looks really cool, is true to the genre and is animated well.\n•	I really enjoyed each new character that was generated.  They all look really unique and fit in with the overall aesthetic of the game.  I even had fun with the new names that they were given.\n•	If you liked how Don't Stave looked then The Swindle is going to be right up your alley.\n\nSound:\n•	FX: The sound effects in The Swindle are really, really good. The crack of your blackjack is satisfying and the alarms going off is nerve wracking.\n•	Music:  I was really impressed with the score in this game.  The music is suspenseful and when you get caught it is super exciting.  It amps up the gameplay to that next degree.\n•	Voice Acting: The is no voice acting (at least in the levels I played) in The Swindle, but it doesn't detract from the experience.\n\nFinal Verdict:\n•	The Swindle is a very fun and often frustrating game to play.  So of course I really loved it.  You get really invested in surviving when your entire paycheck is on the line!  Its a neat take on the genre and I think it holds it's own.  It is priced appropriately and seems open to a lot of new content opportunities if the developers choose to go that direction.

The dreaded "mixed" average rating that The Swindle currently has in no way reflects the quality of the game in my opinion. The Swindle is a tense platform game, with roguelike elements that delivers in a unique way the sense of accomplishment with every successful heist. Moreover there's a great balance between the money earned and the available upgrades, in such a way that you never feel like you have much more money than needed. The aesthetic of the game is great and it constantly convinces me to try one more heist. Really addictive.\n\nTruth to be told I played the game with gamepad. With gamepad the responsiveness is great. I suppose that the complaints about the gameplay are coming from people that plays with keyboard, which maybe makes things more difficult than it should.","August 3, 2015","true","7.0"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","11","17","0","0"

You break into randomly-generated houses swarming with robot security guards and attempt to steal all the cash. Eventually you can move up the socio-economic ladder and break into richer buildings like banks and casinos. But it's all moving towards one goal: hack into the AI that is about to be unleashed on the city in 100 days.\n\nThere's two levels of failure in this game: You can trip the alarm, or you can die. If you trip the alarm, you get a frantic little while to scarper before the police show up. If you die, you lose all money on this heist and a day towards the deadline.\n\nIt's an interesting game. Not as refined as, say, Spelunky. The platforming is a little awkward, and occasionally the level can provide you with an impossible house. There's a nice upgrade tree that you need to climb, but probably cannot get it all before the deadline.\n\nThere's lots of great little elements. The heists themselves are neat, with steadily increasing dangerous foes. The atmosphere is great - footsteps change as you go from rooftop to floor, and the rain pattering on rooftops dulls as you go inside. And my favourite, Big Ben chimes when it hits the top of the hour in the real world!\n\nThe controls and feel need a bit of polish, but overall it's quite a neat game. It's a good colleague and counterpoint to Spelunky - a campaign rather than a run, upgrades instead of items, patience and care rather than running to the finish.","August 23, 2015","true","54.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Difficulty ramps up when you upgrade, so don't bother upgrading. You've got to grind ♥♥♥♥♥♥ missions to afford anything, and often the levels will be impossible if you don't have the ability the game randomly decided you *must* have. As if the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ going on the missions picked the wrong ♥♥♥♥ing houses. Oh, and you can't continue onto the next house either. You waste a day (and minutes waiting for transitions) on a house with nothing in it. Gee, thanks game.\n\nThe game might technically be in 60fps, but characters move so damn slowly, it's wasted on this game. Which makes the stealth gameplay so much worse, because you're waiting for robots to inch along the screen, or worse case, waiting for their individual patrols to sync up so you can actually do something. This game is way too slow. Comparing it to Mark of the Ninja like the other reviews do is criminal. Jumping controls are floaty, and often gets stuck on edges of the platforms. Early on you can get trapped in rooms if you haven't got jump upgrades.\n\nIt's beyond stupid. It's very aptly named, I guess this is the next trend for steam games - avoid the "Early Access" caution that players have and just release the game unfinished anyway.\n\nAnd to be clear: This is not the "difficulty" of the game. A door you simply can't go through is not hard - it blocks off part of the map and makes the grind longer. A computer with a camera facing it that will force the alarm isn't hard - you have to trip the alarm if you want to progress. Procedural content at it's worst.\n\nOh yeah - and navigating the upgrade menu is just garbage. No mouse navigation for menus? This wasn't originally an XBLA game was it? Actually that'd probably explain how hot this game runs.\n\nFinally - the devs are ignoring any criticism of their precious child, and are banning criticism from the discussion board. Refund is processing now.\n\nThe real shame is that the concept was not approached by a competent developer with a QA team, to fix balance issues, and generate levels properly.","July 28, 2015","false","1.4"," 34 of 62 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","34","62","0","0"

Smash a window, grab the loot and get out. That sort of thing. Well, this will probably get you killed.\nIt's all about being patient, calculating your jumps and using your abilities as best as you can.\n\nAnd that's exactly where The Swindle is a brilliant game. Each ability is usefull. Some don't seem that usefull but it's all about how you play the game. Knowing where the computers are seems like a waste of resource when it's that or a tripple a jump, but information makes the job easier. Tripple jumping to, sure. If you are unlucky and face a lot of empty void between too ledges.\nAnyway, managing your money, establishing "the best buying plan", min/maxin risks and rewards while in missions, figuring out how to get that heavily guarded chest...it's not just a action game, it's a puzzle action game. And with procedural genereration of terrain, the same situation is hardly encountered again.\nAs for how it's proceduraly generated, well, don't expect the same few rooms over and over. There will be similarities but a small underground map can be as easily encountered as a huge 3 storys with a one tower or two. The map are diverse, there may not be enough sort of level but the increasing difficulty and payout rewards make them just the right amount.\n\nOne last thing, the music and sounds are good.

Also review too long, check the comment section for my conclusion. Its the first comment.\n\n[/tr]\n[/table]	The Swindle	Official Website: http://www.sizefivegames.com/games/theswindle/\nDeveloper And Publisher: Size Five Game\nGenre:Heisting, Platforming, Stealth, 2D	What is The Swindle?[/td]\nThe Swindle is a 2D steampunky british inspired swindling game where you play as a criminal mastermind watching over a single minion as he proceeds to rob houses and swindle money from computer terminal. BTW you are playing as that thief.\n\nThe game features roguelike elements where any hits your character take or any spike he drop into will cause him or her to die a painful death and voiding all loot and any bonuses they might have had.\n\nAlso part of the main point of the game is that it features randomly generated rooms.\n\nGame was made using gamemaker engine.\n\nOnward to the review I suppose.	Option Menu And Performance	It has options for the following regarding display settings: Resolution, Vsync, Effect Control.\nThere's no colourblind option in the game.\n\nAs for sound you only get Global Sound Setting and Music Setting. No individual slider for effect and such.\n\nControl Option: You get to rebind the keyboard control and the controller as well plus it has deadzone adjustment for controller. The mouse isn't supported much though.\n\nRegarding performances, prior to patch 1.04 the game tends to spike like crazy whenever something happens although that isn't much of an issue anymore and I am able to maintain steady 60fps with no issue.	Graphics	Everything as it usually is happens to be completely in 2D except for that rather jarring swinging effect which is 3D.\n\nFor most parts the game design looks good enough to pass off as 19th century steampunk Britian with short sighted robot cops patrolling within the homes of everyone but eh. Enemies and traps are easily differentiate from the background elements mostly because it has none.\n\nThings does a get bit messy once you tripped the alarm though since EVERYTHING will be bathed in red floodlight.\n\nThe general UI received some minor improvement update but which greatly increased its usability. The upgrade screen for instance now only shows buyable upgrade with a star.\n\nEverything also looks like it was made in crayon now that I think about it. Also if your screen looks a bit too dirty its in the option menu to adjust the dirt effect. I simply left it off because it got in the way.	Music and Game Cue	After 6 hours of listening to the music yes you will get tired of it save for 1 or 2 tracks and you might turn it off. Until you do though the song is alright for a game such as this since its not some fast pace tempo tune like you would find in MGS Rising rock theme no sir, its all tuney stuff.\n\nMeanwhile for the sound effect, thankfully its clear to hear the enemy, hear the terminal through walls and other gameplay enhancing things. Which is might as well since enemies do have ears, least for some of them.	Controls	A bloody ♥♥♥♥ing mess if you use a keyboard even though you can rebind it, you might be able to get used to placing both hands on the keyboard but I did not.\n\nThankfully the controller works as well as you expected, not terrible. Full support for Xbox controller this was tested using the logitech F310 and it was nearly flawless.\n\nPrior to patch 1.04 game was pretty hit and miss with its control and like an asthmatic cat it often cough up and cause you to freeze up, lags, glitches or straight up won't respond which has been slightly alleviated in patch 1.04. Which is to say it is less likely to murder you now and jumping no longer looks as if you are phasing through the sky 60 times per second.	Gameplay	Ok so here is the general flow I will talk about:\n\nPre-Mission>Mission>After Mission>Extra Note\n\nPre-Mission\nYour designated thief is in his space craft high above the earth atmosphere powered by steam. This is where you buy upgrade, do a few shenanigans with the remaining day and where you choose which mission to go to. Since you start the game here its a good idea to get your bearing by jumping a bit.\n\nDuring Mission\nDuring the mission you will encounter guard robot, floating lamps, traps, shooting robot, security station and of course, money and terminal station.\n\nThe gist of it is that you arrive via the droppod, proceed to steal everything not bolted down while avoiding the pesky traps, camera and robot guards and escaping unscathed. Easier said than done, guards have clearly defined field of view which you must avoid unfortunately so does the camera and the floating camera and to add insult to your criminal abilities there's also listening robot forcing you to sneak past slowly.\n\nGuards are not 1 type either, each location provides new ones differing in ability, sizes, power, endurance and speed in which they dash across the room. Not to mention those horrible traps scattered all over the place which can take a hit on both your money and health.\n\nThankfully you can disable/destroy the traps and guards with upgrades. Using your nightstick/baton on the robot will reduce them to an oily scrap and bombs+ hacking ensure that you will get past those traps but its not to say doing it will always give you an advantage, sometimes you will just die due to a terrible idea you thought was brilliant.\n\nLet say you triggered the damn alarms, you have around 30-60 second to GTFO before the cops arrive and they do not mess around. Those boys in blues do not appreciate having their tea time ruined by sending overspecced police robot after you.\n\nSay you survive all that and got all the cash and hacked all the terminal its time to get back to the droppod and GTFO of there.\n\nAfter mission\nChoose either to go back to the ships for upgrades or straightaway do another swindling business. The results are tallied up and provided you swindled half of the total amount it will count as a successful heist and you get more bonus the more your current burglar have more successful heist titles under his belt.\n\nThen you use the money for more upgrades and to unlock more profitable locations teeming with tougher enemies.\n\nExtra Note\nEach heist counts as a day whether or not it was successful and you only have 100 day to complete the ultimate objective: Steal a single item from the toughest location in the game, The Police Station itself. Completely doable. [Sarcasm]\n\nAlso the world generator will absolutely shaft you in the stomach because it often gives you location with weird as heck architecture. This is the single biggest complain of mine regarding the game since you can very easily fail a heist due to the world generator itself BUT it is passable with the correct upgrades so not a total Con but still a Con.	Patches And Issues	I would have given this game a complete thumbs down had I tried reviewing it back when it first released but Dan the Dev seems pretty responsive to the community so I waited for some updates before reviewing and I am happy to say most of my grief with the game has been addressed which includes the UI, controls and general game tweaks.\n\nThe game controls wont actively murder you now and the UI is actually usable at last. The last remaining issue is still the weird as heck world generator but it seems that it is intended so I will chalk it up to a +/- case.","August 14, 2015","true","6.4"," 19 of 34 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","19","34","0","4"

You go into a mission and steal what you can, but it is up to you when to leave.\n\nPros:\n-Procedurally generated levels!\n-A real sense of progression\n-Lots of variety in the enemies and environmental hazards\n-Great art style\n- Lot of interesting and useful upgrades\n-The 100 day limit really pushes tension and urges you to try things you might not otherwise.\n-It is tough, but always fair.\n\nCons:\n-The jumping can be a bit....finicky? I often mean to do one thing but do another. Its not floaty like littlebigplanet, but its also not solid and predictable like mario. Its inbetween.\n- There are weird issues about jumping on stairs. It just doesnt seem to work on a frequent basis.\n\nNeutral\n-You will fail. A lot.  Like a whole lot. You will have an amazing run completing 5 levels in a row, only to have everything go wrong the 8 tries in a row after that. It can be the biggest feeling of satisfaction to rage quit and (voluntary because I am sorta OCD) total restart. Get used to restarting the game. After a while, you will be able to breeze through areas much quicker and get further and further.\n- The last mission costs 400,000 to do. If you fail, you must pay it again. Even at the endgame, this is a bunch of money. That said, when I got to the final mission, I have over a million.\n- You might be afraid of running out of days (which is possible), but at the endgame, you are so capable and have so many upgrades, you can make up the money to extend the game or try the final mission again in just a few levels.\n\nTIPS:\n- Dont be afraid to just bail out of the mission. It is better to get some money than none.\n- Some areas are inaccessible in levels unless you have certain upgrades.

It is basically a cross between mark of the Ninja and Spelunky. I personally loved Mark of the Ninja, but wasn't a huge fan of spelunky. but that being said, it takes the best components of each and makes something beautiful. Now I might be exagerating, but I still love thisgame. It is extremely frustrating and unforgiving, but it always has me coming back for more.\n\nPros:\n-Amazing art style\n-Soundtrack is great\n-Brutal but rewarding progression\n-Rogue lite elements (done well)\n-So satisfying to complete a heist\n\nCons:\n-Sometimes the movement can be clunky. I sometimes find myself arguing with the screen when I lightly graze some spikes and die immidiatly.\n-The UI could use a little work, but is definetly not bad\n-This game is BRUTAL and UNFORGIVING. Now that might not be a bad thing for some people, myself included, but I could see it as being a turn off for many casual gamers.\n\nTo sum everything up, I feel that this game is something that I will spend a lot of my time with. It punishes me when I do something wrong, but I always learn from it. When I do something right, I am definetly rewarded by the game, and it makes me feel like a bad ♥♥♥. The game is definetely worth the money and your time if you are someone who enjoys stealth games with rpg elements and platforing, but is not afraid of a challenge. You'll get better as I have, and will find yourself coming back for more. Just hang in there, and try not to skim your ♥♥♥ on those spikes.

My first playthrough was tough and really left me, for lack of better description, sour. I'd describe this game as a rouge-like, for the fact that dying is both common and educational, so you'll be better next time.\n\nThe main premise of the game is that a security software is being produced, and will be complete in 100 days. Your goal is to steal it before it's public release. Everytime you go on a heist, one day goes by. As you progress, you buy upgrades to be stronger, faster, and more effective in securing money. Death comes increadibly easily, but your upgrades aren't wiped on death. There's no time limit to the levels, so you can progress at your own pace. Even getting seen isn't impossible to escape from, as you can avoid the police long enough to get back to your airship, or stay and get more moolah.\n\nIf you're not into rouge-like, stealth games, you most likely won't like this game.

There's some game design flaws here with some imprecise controls at times, but at the core of the experience, once it gets going, is a fun game where you sneak around and attempt not to get caught. When it gets going, it's pretty good, as you try to figure out the best path to make it through the level, and the randomly generated layouts can help in keeping up the variety. Those who don't want stealth are going to have a problem here, but those who love the genre, you've got a great match with The Swindle.\n\nGameplay Footage and Video First Impressions: http://youtu.be/j0UlR3zGLus\n\nLists:\n\n+:\nWhen the game gets going, it challenges you to the best of it's ability to take a situation, break it down, and find the optimal path.\nThe TNT mechanic helped open up things in particular and was good for the random generation.\nThe stealth does feel at least at a faster pace then others in the genre at times, especially when between elements.\nGood mechanics for a risk/reward regarding when you are caught, whether to stay around or to get the hell out of there.\n-:\nVery, very slow start. Lack of starting equipment and abilities hinders the player very early, and it can be a little bit to get “fun” while it gets up to speed. Needed to start with more then you did.\nLack of tutorials and basic mechanics will lead to unnecessary deaths in a game that has a time limit in terms of days. That's frustrating.\nInaccuracy on line of sight cones and melee range due to visuals can lead to moments where you sit there going “how did that not hit him” or “how did I not get caught?”\nThe procedural generation can be problematic with making elements that the player can't honestly deal with in a good fashion, like putting a mine at the bottom of a cavern for example (at least a GOOD way of dealing with it). Can also create rooms that literally have no good purpose (nothing but enemies, no cash.\nBalance problem as terminals are the only worth while target.

And don't worry if you are, like me, not a big fan of hardcore stealth games: this one has exacly the right amount of stealth so that you cannot easily rush through levels but you don't have to be planning each move for ten minutes either.\n\nAs a steampunk crook, you have a hundred days of heists to prepare for the big one. Through these 100 days, you will, ahem, "earn" money from every (procedurally generated) house you visit, and then use it to buy upgrades that will make you much better at your job. Those upgrades range from athletic ones, like double or triple jumps, to gadgets like bombs or bugs to help you steal more money, to ones that make the police take more time to appear when you set off an alarm during a heist. Which you will do, like, millions of times.\n\nAnd yes, you will get caught. And you will die. A LOT. And you will curse at everything around you. And then you'll say to yourself "okay, just one more heist". And twenty heists later you will still be there, telling yourself that it will be just one more, and still playing. Remember Spelunky? Well, yes, that.\n\nThe graphics, the music, the whole ambientation of the game are just fantastic, and add up to the great feeling of immersion The Swindle has.\n\nDon't be scared of reviews mentioning that controls are bad: even if that might have been the case for some people on the release date version of the game, sucessive patches have made them much better. In fact, the tweaks that are being added little by little by Dan Marshall on every patch are making the game even better and more fun to play while making the learning curve much gentler for first-time players.\n\nSo, long story short: go buy The Swindle!","August 11, 2015","true","23.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This, to me, is like complaining about Dark Souls because you can't cancel any moves. If it were easier to walljump up from under a ledge, or take a flying leap over spikes to hit a guard before he turns around, or fire your EMP at just the right moment as you crash down on top of a sea of baddies, then this would not be the game it is, and I, for one, think it would be far worse. Likewise, if failing to perfectly execute such complex moves didn't have such dire consequences, it would not be the game it is. If the controls made no sense - like, if they were inconsistent, or it wasn't possible to learn the timing given the animations - then I could understand the hate, but I guess a lot of people just didn't know what kind of a game they were getting. My prediction is that a lot of the people who are leaving negative reviews are gonna return to the game, get used to it, get better at it, and love it like they should.","August 12, 2015","true","30.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

That said I can definitely relate with the complaints that are being made in the majority of the negative reviews. Those are:\n-Wonky controls\n-Impossible levels\n-Inconsistent glitches\nFrom what I can tell, The Swindle was built with the same controls design as Gun Monkeys... and quite frankly that was my biggest gripe with Size Five's previous title. These are definitely not your typical controls and it'll take you some time to get the hang of them and understand them. My biggest frustration was figuring out that when you stand close to an edge and turn around you end up sliding down the wall, resulting in many unfortunate alarms being set off without knowing why until you figure out this mechanic. Second biggest was learning the rules of mounting a wall from below. For some reason just colliding with the bottom corner is not enough to hang on but jumping directly underneath it while facing it is. It's inconsistent but it works. And that's the thing, while not intuitive it was built by design and it is a clever way of mounting a wall (although I'd prefer to push down to slide down it like every other game)... it's just you have to figure it out by yourself that that was built into the code and I can see why that would put off a lot of newcomers. As for me, it didn't take long to get the feel for things and I was able to feel in control in no time. I would suggest that there be some kind of tutorial that forces you to learn these things so that you don't go in blind not knowing the controls of the game. There are plenty of puzzles a game should present, what your controls are should not be one of them.\n\nBeing procedurally generated instantly brings on more scrutiny about fairness and with this game it's definitely easy to pass it off as short-sighted in design when in the first level you can sometimes only get 1 lousy percent of the loot because you don't have any of the upgrades needed to do certain puzzles yet. With the time restraint of 100 days, each day you lose to a lousy RNG dice roll seems like quite the unfair price to pay. I couldn't say whether or not it actually is always possible to beat the whole game despite the seed you have as that would take a lot more meticulous research of the game's underlying code to determine that but I can say that more often than not the levels are fairly generated and it's just you not doing well that's the real issue. Again, for someone new to the game, this will probably push you the wrong way and might make you feel like it's not worth the time but for me, I like a game that spits in my face and calls me mean names and waves in my face my flaws and that I could and should do better. I like to be pushed and be given levels that rub in my face that my upgrade path I've chosen was the wrong one. It's brutal and not very nice but in the end I play games for the challenge of figuring out how to beat it and The Swindle by design is a puzzle to figure out in every inch of it.\n\nNow there are against-the-grain design choices, and then there are is just plain broken. Climbing a wall and having an enemy's sightline clip through and set off all the alarms is just not fun. Being clearly behind an enemy that doesn't spontaneously turn around suddenly turn around without cause... is not fun. But these bugs are few and far between and I imagine they'll get cleaned up.\n\nThe game is playable by all my standards and the bugs aren't bad enough that I shy away from itching for more. Losing your cover in a heist is not the worst thing to happen, the game let's slip ups and bad level generations happen and you can still pull of the final swindle with time to spare. It is brutal in the sense that you can lose 10-15 minutes of your time if you screw up at the end of a lucrative heist but you don't lose the game, something that Spelunky tended to relish in doing.\n\nThat's what I love about The Swindle though, it makes each successful heist count big time and each one that you do in succession count even higher. The game expects you to die and so when you don't you feel like a god and the game let's you relish in it. By design, this game was meant to be for those who wanted to dive deep into it and learn it's nitty gritties and tell you to go grow up if you don't. It's a bold move for sure but I love it.\n\nSo should you buy it? Depends on if you are going to take the time and have the patience to get to know it. This is not a game for those that are easily put off by failure. You'll be frustrated with it and want to kick it across the room plenty of times but as a result when you do pull off that final swindle the reward is much more grand and delicious.\n","July 28, 2015","true","21.2"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

Yes, sometimes the levels are "broken" because you haven't got the skills to open a locked door or make a door with bombs.  Sometimes a level locks one of the money terminals away in a sealed room you have no hope of reaching.  Sometimes enemies are in places that make them impossible to avoid or take care of.  I've definitely had my share of controller-twisting-frustration moments, but part of what makes "The Swindle" fun is that some of those are (maybe) the game's fault, and many of them are obviously my fault: hitting LEFT instead of RIGHT, misjudging a jump into a spike pit, etc.  Failure isn't just "the game is broken," it's frequently "I need to do better," and that's a great way to do gameplay.\n\nA lot of the stuff I would have whined about was recently fixed: the upgrade tree makes it obvious what you can and can't buy at a given moment.  The scrabble move is easier, so a lot of the early levels where you haven't unlocked skills are more navigable.  The first level more consistently gets you enough money to buy the essential hacking skill.  The prices for a lot of the "essential" initial skills/upgrades have been adjusted so you don't get to day 50 before having more than a thousand pounds handy.\n\nI've been obsessed with this game for a couple weeks, and really enjoying the challenges, foibles and all.","August 8, 2015","true","34.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The art style is very cool, the music works well, too, because if you get caught it really ramps up and makes it feel like a desperate situation.\n\nI'm only part way through the game and the things I figured out so far to make the heists successful are to be *VERY* patient during the heists themselves, get a lot of upgrades before attempting the next level, and some money just isn't worth stealing.\n\nThe only major problem I have with the game are the controls (especially pertaining to jumping and wall climbing/hanging). They don't seem tight enough to my liking after having played games like Mark of the Ninja.

The amount of grinding time before you unlock enough abilities to make the game fun is agonizing, especially because you will have to do it over and over again (since it's a roguelike).  The random level generator frequently puts together bizarre combinations that just seem cruel and is made all the more difficult to navigate because of the somewhat shoddy jump and wall-grab mechanics.  A poor example of a heist game, you don't so much as sneak and steal as much as you just wait for robots to turn their back to you before hitting them in the head then playing a tedious minigame.

This is mostly, I'm not afraid to say, down to my incompetence, which this game isn't afraid to remind me of. Regularly.\n\nTo describe the core of the game - steal as much cash from each procedurally generated level as possible, without dying - makes it sound simple and repetitive, but that's sort of the genius. Your goal and the way you achieve it often is simple, but your one small mistake will cost you and you will hate yourself for it every time.\n\n"I just need to drop down, whack that guard and the jump over those spikes," you think, just before mistiming your initial drop, getting spotted by the guard, and jumping into those spikes in a state of panic. Of course, you then try and make up for that mistake by doing something more risky next time (you need to make up for that lost cash somehow!) and, well, you can probably guess why I've barely scratched the surface in 11 hours.\n\nThere are a huge amount of upgrades available for you to vary your approach and tactics for the inevitable sixth and seventh playthrough, which often leads to those confidence-dashing moments, too. Y'know, just as you found that perfect combination of upgrades that means that this guy is no longer a threa--oh, he got me.\n\nI've read a few comments saying that it needs a tutorial of some sort. It really, really doesn't.

You have 100 days to gear up for the big heist by breaking into buildings to hack computers to steal money in order to buy upgrades to help you circumvent the increasily secure buildings with a variety of new enemies at every turn. The levels are procedurally generated so you have to be equipped to handle any number of situations.\n\nIt's a tough game that will require multiple play throughs because you have to learn about all the new obstacles and enemies as you encounter them and as you're figuring out the systems you're rapidly running out of time. I barely made it to the 3rd "area" in my first run before I ran out of time and had to start over again.\n\nBut as you improve it's a lot of fun trying to get that one really strong run where you're figuring out the best way to most efficiently purchase upgrades while also unlocking new areas. Do you save up for a new tool or do you risk going to the next area knowing that hacking even one computer will give you more money than three computers from the previous area?\n\nI still haven't beat it but I've come oh so close and happily started a new game hoping that the next run would be better. If you're looking to beat a game in one sitting this isn't for you. But if you want to play a game that you gradually get better at playing and optimizing how you unlock your skill tree as you play then by all means play this game!\n\nOnce you get into the groove of successful heists it's very easy to get into the "one more try" mentality and easily burn away hours at a time.","August 2, 2015","true","32.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I personally love hacking the enemy ai bots and having them turn on one another.  It's also a blast to blow them up with their own bombs.\nThe game is challenging, and in this particular case that adds to the enjoyment as it feels like an accomplishment when you complete a mission and it's a real delight when you can get the Ghost accomplishment (getting all money in level undetected).  The difficulty is similar to Spelunky in that you can die instantly by falling into spikes or being rammed by a bot or hit by one, death comes quickly as it's 1 hit and you're out.

This is mostly, I'm not afraid to say, down to my incompetence, which this game isn't afraid to remind me of. Regularly.\n\nTo describe the core of the game - steal as much cash from each procedurally generated level as possible, without dying - makes it sound simple and repetitive, but that's sort of the genius. Your goal and the way you achieve it often is simple, but your one small mistake will cost you and you will hate yourself for it every time.\n\n"I just need to drop down, whack that guard and the jump over those spikes," you think, just before mistiming your initial drop, getting spotted by the guard, and jumping into those spikes in a state of panic. Of course, you then try and make up for that mistake by doing something more risky next time (you need to make up for that lost cash somehow!) and, well, you can probably guess why I've barely scratched the surface in 11 hours.\n\nThere are a huge amount of upgrades available for you to vary your approach and tactics for the inevitable sixth and seventh playthrough, which often leads to those confidence-dashing moments, too. Y'know, just as you found that perfect combination of upgrades that means that this guy is no longer a threa--oh, he got me.\n\nI've read a few comments saying that it needs a tutorial of some sort.

It must have un-reviewed it when I refunded it.\n\nThe game claims to be a very difficult roguelike stealth game. What it turned out to be for me was a poorly designed action platformer with unresponsive controls and little to no room for creative problem solving or advancement through mastery.\n\nThe levels are procedural, but rarely-if ever- will you see something that you didn't see your first time through a given map type. While the levels do branch, they branch like the roots of a tree: splintering off into an eventual dead-end, offering you the chance to backtrack -a lot- instead of providing alternate routes through a level.\n\nProgression through these levels is so harshly gated by ability unlocks that it feels like a metroidvania more than a roguelike. Your abilities don't HELP you solve difficult problems, they simply decide if you can solve the problem or not. You see that branch of the level with LITERALLY NO ENTRANCES beneath you? Better already have teleport or explosives at your disposal, because there’s -no- other way to get to that  room (and the loot therein) on foot and no coming back to specific levels after you leave. This might be less frustrating if abilities unlocks were somehow tied to player skill, instead of simply purchased with the currency that you grind/collect at a infuriatingly slow pace on each level.\n\nAbout the currency collection: It’s incredibly frustrating. Money is easy to get and hard to keep, as any loot a character has when they die evaporates with the character. An understandable mechanic, weighing the risk of death against the allure of additional treasure, but that relationship falls the pieces when the character is killed so often, and so quickly, by things they can't control:\n-Jump button doesn't jump and land in spikes.\n-Attack fails to register and the guard turns around and kills you.\n-Wall jump is misaligned by a few pixels and you jump out a window.\n-Get stuck in a portion of the level that is INESCAPABLE.\nThe game is rife with bugs and design flaws large enough that paired with the level of punishment for each player death it turns money collection into a slog.\n\nI guess my statement about skill in regard to skill usage carried a sentiment that can be applied to gameplay as a whole. It would be far more tolerable if skill played a larger role in it. The only skill (other than winning arguments with the awkward and unresponsive controls) that I found useful was patience. Not once did I run into a situation who's solution wasn't immediately apparent, instead the majority of situations I encountered were instead challenging because their solution was (while obvious) tedious to solve, and the same as the 14 before it.\n\nWhen compared to other any other modern game in either genre that the Swindle claims to be part of, stealth games, or roguelikes/roguelike platformers, The Swindle's lack of refined design, nuanced gameplay, and functional controls stand out like sore thumbs.\n\nAlso there's no room for any stealth in the game by the way. No sound or light mechanics, enemy guard have a sight line of only a few units, and there is liitle to no way to "sneak" past guards. You just wait for them to turn around and hit them with your hitting stick.\n\nI will say the game looks and sounds very nice, which it should considering how resource heavy it is.\n\nWait for an 80% off sale and decide for yourselves, but I wouldn't give this game away. It sullies the roguelike and stealth genres in my opinion.","July 28, 2015","false","0.8"," 19 of 39 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","19","39","0","0"

Each heist you can steal more and more money, getting to higher security levels as you do. The game only gives you 100 tries to reach the end, which I couldn't do on my first run.\n\nIt's a really fun game and it's got a lot of replay value, especially from choosing different upgrades and priorities as you upgrade your thieves' skills.\n\nThe characters and their names are also randomly generated, with a lot of random elements.

Looking at the keybinds, the M button is default for attack, but everything appeared to be rebindable (the E and F keys appeared to be unused default as well, so these would probably make for better attack keys imo).  It does not appear that the camera can be moved at all but now that I think about it I did not really test this functionality.  If the camera is static then maybe with M as default, you can use both hands with the keyboard to play?  In any rate, onto the meat of the game.\n\nThe art style is enjoyable, some of the animations sometimes come off a bit weird to me though?  Kind of hard to explain but I was having a good enough time playing it for my first hour.\n\nThe gameplay takes a bit of learning to get used to how movement in this environment works, and there did not seem to be a lot of tutorials.  I am fine without the game telling me every tiny little thing and learning for myself.  The progression can be interesting in this way as well as you encounter various different security measures and the trial and error in figuring out how to deal with them.\n\nI failed a lot.  I have gone through a good amount of characters, as when you die you get a newly picked character to play as.  When you do die though, you keep all the upgrades that you painstakingly progressed to.  There is a "bank" and "haul" system.  After completing a mission successfully you bank your money and it seems to be safe.  You use the money to upgrade your characters' abilities and to unlock different tools.\n\nI enjoyed the music in the game as well.  There can be some difficulty spikes in the randomly generated levels but taking your time and using your resources prove to be the most effective ways of winning.\n\nFor the price, I think you can get a lot of content if you're interested in what they're advertising.","July 28, 2015","true","1.7"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

You'll be beaten by guards, you'll be shocked by generators, you'll set off alarms and be crushed by the security shutters and you'll misjudge distance and fall off the roof.\n\nThe combination of procedurally generated levels and difficulty scaling (though new areas and new enemies) really comes together in making you use the most of your skills and tools. With your increasing income from successful heists you get access to more powerful tools to increase your options in facing the more secure venues.\n\nThe tools and upgrades themselves are all useful, from remotely detonating mines from a safe distance to being shrouded in steam for several seconds to evade a patrolling steambot. There are a lot of different enemies in the game and with each new area you unlock you'll find a large amount of new enemies that ensure you have to adapt your playstyle to get all that sweet cash.\n\nLastly the art and atmosphere is really pretty with each area having a distinctive style, not to mention all the little touches like when the grime and moisture effects on the screen (that thankfully don't go too far and obstruct your vision).\n","August 11, 2015","true","16.1"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","1"

You must aquire money to get the best skills which will make heists easier and unlock more places to heist at.\n====================================================================================\nGameplay\n====================================================================================\nIt's a 2D platformer where you must hack computers, pick up cash and beat robots to destruction. To do this you must aquire skills which will make it easier such as double jumping or better hack speed. There isn't anything complex but it is a challenging game mainly due to the random generation being a pain and creating rooms in ridiculous places. Get caugh inside a building by a robot and the alarm bells will ring and you will have a limited time to get out before the advanced police force come to beat you up. It's 'permadeath' in a sense since you get a new character each time though the only thing that gets reset is the amount of heists you have accomplished.\n====================================================================================\nConclusion\n====================================================================================\nI give the game a 9/10 for being fun, unique and plain great fun.

While the game has a very unique style to it and a lovely bit of core gameplay, there is a level of responsiveness that a game like this demands from the controls. The unfortunate truth of it is that the game does not have this in the slightest. The character feels oddly "floaty" and you don't have much control over your jump height. Additionally the walls are awkwardly sticky for my tastes, and combined with the inability to control jumps this will leave you flailing ineffectually at a window while trying to avoid line of sight.\n\nThe game is fun, but it needs a lot of fine tuning.

I was lucky enough to get access to it day before release. It brings some fresh air into a genre and has some interesting mechanics. I like the steam punk feel without it being to overwhelming for casual player not into this sort of scenario.\n\nThe biggest concern with a game I have is that it's severely punishing for mistakes made early on in the game. If you don't do well in your first 10 days your remaining 90 days will be nearly impossible to complete as a game difficulty increases with each passing day.\n\nDespite being unable to complete a game I enjoyed it immensely and I see a game having huge potential for replayability.\n\nThe game looks like something that be good material for speedrunners. I made a video showing gameplay and adding some extra thoughts about the design, you can see it here:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4M_FH4bU28&list=PLCZleGQiTyuBsq-orc3Nclo_CkoMgeT8z&index=15","July 28, 2015","true","4.7"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","4","10","0","0"

(And you really need to be using the controller.)\n\nThe difficulty scale gets completely out of hand if you don't have basic upgrades, and even though there's a fair amount of upgrades in the airship, you run out of time before you can probably buy five of them, let alone fully upgrade them.\n\nThe gimmick of this game is that it keeps getting harder to scale, but it's too easy to die. If you miss one level you're completely screwed and will lose when you run out of time. Oh yeah, the time function in this game.\n\nThe way "days" work in this game is that you have 100 of them before all your stats are reset. Yeah. Every bit of progress you achieved is deleted after a small amount of time. "Oh, but I only managed to buy hacking, bombs, and no fall damage upgrades! How am I supposed to get all those cool gadgets that allow me to see where things are faster, and delay the police?" Well, you don't. It's completely impossible. If someone actually managed to beat this game and get all the upgrades, I would be amazed.\n\nBut hey, maybe you want a game that's completely unbeatable, but I like feeling as if I'm a god at the end of games, not trip on my own shoes and die when I find the final boss.","August 11, 2015","false","3.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I'm really not a fan of the bots being able to 1 hit you or the fall damge (which kills me 50% of the time). When i bought the game it seemed like a stealth game but's not. The controls are just absolutely terrible! It took me 5 minutes to figure out how to get into a level then another 3 minutes to figure out how to kill a bot. You don't use your mouse and B/M works as your left click. A lot of things cost a lot of money too. After you buy hack everything is pretty much over $2,000 which is hard to get with these controls. The graphics look great and i want to play this and have fun but right now i can't. If they fix the controls in future updates i could recommend.

Wonderful.\n\nTries, being the keyword. More often than not the controls are sluggish, your character doesn't respond. There's no way to easily fall off the edge of a ledge, instead prompting you to begin sliding down it - which is ruinous for most runs.\n\nYou can be having a perfectly fine run, killing all the robots as you explore the house - only for yourself to realize that every computer is underneath four layers of concrete, disjointed from each other - which effectively makes the level entirely worthless because Computers are the main way you net cash. Thank you random generation!\n\nThe start of the game is -very- rough, where if you don't do the first area for at least 10 days, and buy Hacking for electrical doors, as well as double jump - you'll face many warehouse missions (I wasted six days in a row, on three different new games) where you simply cannot enter the facalities at all, or if you can it's begging for immediate death. In an effort to keep things fresh, there's lovely randomly generation - you more often than not get scenarios that are simply unbeatable, where computers are swarmed with two robots on a 1x cube, with spikes on either side of them with a camera scanning the room - and the computer to turn off said camera? Is the room directly past it. Where every window inside is guarded by a camera, that you're lucky at best if the controls work with you well enough to allow you to break through it, and jump onto a wall out of it's Line of Sight quickly enough.\n\nThis could be construded as 'They're just whining about the game being too hard!' but it really isn't. There's very simple things, and very simple mistakes that you'll be cursing at yourself over, and over, and over again - suddenly realizing you're on Day 20 with a handful of upgrades and fewer results from broken levels, half-broken controls, and awful enemy AI. Sure, I can be immediately noticed while I'm falling off the side of a window at escape velocity. Sure, the camera that saw me with less than three pixels wide of Line of Sight (It's clearly and physically marked) knew for certain there was a burgalur.\n\nIt has heart, but the mechanics just aren't there. They need to be tweaked and refined. Maybe if there's some updates? That'd be great. Before then? It's fun, before you hit your first randomly generation mission that calls for an immediate and outright alert, or death to get -anything- from, resulting in yet another wasted day.","July 30, 2015","false","16.9"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

A stealth game, and a roguelike at that, where 90% of the time I am ♥♥♥♥ing agape at the controls ♥♥♥♥ing me over is an instant failure. This should not be happening. Characters should not be grabbing onto ledges for no reason and launching themselves randomly in the air. I should not be able to ledgehang jump (which is the same height as a double jump) over one side of the level and get STUCK because the other side requires you to unlock the double jump because there is no ledge on this side to jump off. Really a game like this lives and dies on four simple points.\n\nHow are the controls?\nWell they get a 0/10 because I got caught by the cops because my character jumped up on a ledge when I tried to jump over spikes right into their field of view. You think you are hanging off a wall? think again, you weren't drilling that key into your desk so guess what the game decided it's just going to act like you released it. How about that difficult jump that requires pixel perfect jumping......... oh wait you were pressing a key? The game just wasn't paying attention, happy fall to your death!\n\nHow is the level design?\nWell again it gets a 0/10 started a game with 93% of the money in a sealed room I had no way of getting in. If this happens, restart. Literally just restart. All the money is in vaults, if you can't get 100$ in the first level it's a wasted play through. It is 100% luck based. Levels are random which means the RNG can ♥♥♥♥ you hard. Don't have bombs? Lets put 50% of the money in two vaults inside this walled of room. Don't have mine disarm? Let me just put two mines around the vaults.\n\nHow fun is the gameplay?\nA solid, massive, never going to change 0/10. The game takes 20 missions to get started unlocking basic skills. Then all your annoyances with the limitations and movement system slowly dissapear as you unlock skills. The game takes about 30 mission to even approach being fun. I am not playing Final Fantasy here. I don't have the patience or the masochism required to grind a game into becoming fun. There is a reason why Human Revolution gave you a bunch of free skills, there needs to be a base of functionaility that can be expanded. The swindle literally has you picking up cash off the floor and only evolves past that if you work for it and I do mean work.\n\nHow is the challenge?\nWhat's even less fun than gated basic skills? A game that tells you no when you want to try a hard mission with the skills you have. The final nail in the coffin of 0/10. A stealth game where you literally have to earn the right to unlock higher (read actually fun) difficulties despite random generation giving you things you can't handle. Enjoy 10 missions of basic bots before you get to the better but still random level design.\n\nWrong mindset. Wrong ideas. Wrong execution. Back to the drawingboard. Money back in my pocket.

Controls and stealth wise, it falls short from Mark of the Ninja. However, the random levels give it some replay value, and completing a level to 100% gives a nice feeling, part because of the game's proper difficulty, and part because of the bad controls.\n\nI gave this game a positive review earlier, but after playing some more I changed it to negative. Sometimes the character refuses to cling to the wall after a wall jump, or it just doesn't pick up momentum, and if you get really close to a ledge the character begins to skid down really slowly, making it impossible to jump. If there are spikes down, you're dead. And if you fall near a ledge while sneaking, you'll probably just fall to your death, because the character becomes irresponsive.\n\nMaybe someone forgot to test the game?","August 8, 2015","false","19.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The Swindle is a steampunk cybercrime caper about breaking into buildings, hacking their systems, stealing all their cash, and quickly running away again before the police show up.\n\nAll the buildings you’ll be robbing are randomly-generated, so you’ll never get the same level twice.\n\nMeanwhile, from the safety of your rickety airship up in Outer Space, you can modify your thief with new skills, tools, and all manner of advanced technological horrors, allowing you to take on bigger buildings with better security, for gargantuan rewards!\n\nHave you got what it takes to pull off The Swindle? - Highly Recommended!","October 27, 2015","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Well, slip on your red cap; this is the game for you! Christmas is under attack, and only you can save it! The Devil’s Basilisk is an evil machine that would make it impossible for Santa to infiltrate people’s homes and deliver presents. As such, you, Santa Claus, have devised a plan to restore joy to the good girls and boys. You are going to steal the Devil’s Basilisk. Commanding your elves, or “thieves,” you will jump, bomb, and hack your way to a Merry Christmas. Also, the world is run by robots.\n\nThe Swindle’s art and music are very festive, and set the mood for some platforming action. But don’t be fooled by vision cones; it’s not a Mark of the Ninja clone. This is not truly a stealth-game. More than anything, this is an arcade game. The rigid, deliberate controls recall games in the vein of Mario Bros, and Donkey Kong. Additionally, much like an arcade game, you are most likely going to fail in your first playthrough. Christmas wasn’t built in a day, and this game is challenging. However, unlike most classic arcade games, you do not have a set number of lives before you are forced to restart. Instead, you have 100 days (referencing the song “100 Nights of Christmas”) to reach the last level, perform the ultimate heist, and save the season.\n\nAccess to the last level is expensive, so before you can win, you will need to amass money- and they only accept British Pounds. Fortunately, after the apocalypse, the British Pound was the robot’s currency of choice. Robots cannot love; surely, it is okay to rob them. Using, your Santa infiltration know-how, direct your elves through the slums, banks, and casinos, to take them for everything they’ve got. Every attempted heist costs one of your 100 days, and a successful heist will bring you money and experience bonuses Fail, and one of your elves is banished from the Winter Wonderlands- Santa Claus does not accept failure.\n\nHave you got what it takes to save Christmas?\n","December 11, 2015","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As I got into the game I warmed to the idea, even with there being no New Game+ or what not.\n\nHeres the first issue, the start of the game is a SLOW SLOG. Its great the first time around, as you open new stuff and work out what you want, but on subsequent playthroughs it becomes more than a chore, if becomes infuriating.\nYou will be rerolling a lot too, as your time ticks down and you realise that there is no way you are going to make it.\n\nThis is another issue, the idea might be that you need to race to the end, but all too often you get 3/4s and just shrug and say 'bleh'. You know you aren't going to make it, and have to go through all that slog again, before you can get to the cool bits where you are nimbly jaunting around.\n\nThe main reason this feels like a slog, is due to the fact you are going to feel cheated. Quite often.\nAt the start it will be things such as being placed in buildings you just cant escape. Fine, you arent outfitted for it, but your only option is suicide. Its particularly frustrating when you hit two or three in a row.\n\nThe enemies will sometimes spawn in such strnge ways, and once again early on that it makes stuff impassable. Enemies that will appear on single blocks, with a mine on it also, with a camera above it. Thats one example and by far not the worst, where it feels less like you dont have the skill so much as... well there werent enough variables set up for building the levels.\n\nIt all too often also feels as if the AI bugs out, floating cameras move slowly for most parts, then sometimes will turn on a dime, in a split second.\nYou cant get out of the way, and thats another GG.\nThere is no rhyme or reason to their patrolling either, nothing you can guage, and often, you will spend five minutes just waiting... waiting for the cameras to all align.\n\nI remember reading that the dev hated tropes of stealth games, this one is the worst, and then some. You simply cant read certain situations, and have to just sit on your hands.\n\nThe controls are fairly solid, yet then in minor places fall short. The biggest example of this is when you run into a spike pit, with a roof directly overhead. Sometimes youll make the jump, other times youll smash your double jump to oblivion and still fall in. Tbh, I think there should be a variable not allowing a spike pit in this situation, its just kinda ridic.\nYoull also often find yourself in a situation where you will cling to a wall at a bad time, you are lining up a jump attack or what not, and you dont THINK you are close to the wall, then bam.\n\nAll of this mixes into a milkshake of frustration, where it steps over the line of so many Rogues before it. In all the games of this type I love, I never feel cheated, theres always something to push me to try again, and the knowledge that the next time I will progress a bit further, with the aid of extra exp, or cash, or whatever.\n\nThe opposite is true here, and the fact is you avoid going to new areas due to a lot of these things. People seem to stick to farming Zones 2/3, which once you work out how the bonuses work seems a legit strategy.\nBy putting a time limit on it, and not giving any boosts on subsequent playthroughs, most people wont see the majority of the game. Thats a damned shame.\n\nI've been fairly critical here, so I want to reinforce that I really like this game. It has a lot of heart, the fact is I just dont know whether it will have enough to keep bringing me back.\nThe dev has said they are happy with how it stands, and have no plans for adding an unlimited mode. If I could at least aim for a mode that let me just continue to enjoy and play through the gameplay (thats really why Im here, not the story, as good as it is, sorry) I think I would be happy.\n\nBut the thought of having to do that slog over and over? Often because I feel cheated? Eh...\nThis is one of those games that seems like it could have done really well on EA, with a wider demo giving feedback. Im not sure how they tested this, but it feels like it is a mere month or so of tweaking/feedback away from absolute brilliance.\n\nAs it stands, its just pretty good.","August 2, 2015","false","11.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/riotAlice/recommended/369110/","riotAlice","riotAlice","http://steamcommunity.com/id/riotAlice/","138 products in account","I love the central idea that this game is built around.  But I don't love the heavily flawed controls, and constant bugs and glitches. Just in the last few days of playing, I've encountered many glitches. I've gotten stuck in the scenery, I've had the Teleporter ability completely glitch out and freeze my character in mid-animation so I had to terminate them, I've had enemies somehow see me through solid objects and instantly kill me. When it plays well and how it's supposed to, it's really enjoyable, but when you die several times from glitches and terrain weirdness beyond your control, the gameplay feels cheap and unsatisfying.\n\nThe controls are not tight enough to serve a game which demands constant careful traversal. Sometimes I've slid down stairs onto mines, or had the jump button suddenly become unresponsive. Many of the commands sometimes feel like they're not responding. The game simply does not give you the control and polish you need for the level of skill it wants from you. I love the idea, the challenge, and the look, but the shaky controls, and frustrating glitches make it too flawed a gem for me to recommend. When I die in a game I want it to be because I screwed up, not because the game suddenly decided to get my character stuck in a wall.","May 30","false","70.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
