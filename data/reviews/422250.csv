Shield. Forcefield. Damn that f..king forcefield isn't recharged"\nIt's a violentless roguelike quick-reactions 2D sidescroller quasar collector asteroids avoid game. That means you fly in space but don't have any shooting abilities. Your only 3 (defense) weapons are a ship protecting shield, a pushback forcefield (damn it needs about 3 secs to loadup) and a magnetic-like quasar autocollector. The aim is to collect about 110 quasars (diamond finish) in each of the 15 levels and beat the 3 challenging bosses in a chooseable difficulty. It's highly recommended to use a controller for that. The challenge rises during the level process. So it turnsout the game forces you to strategical thinking like "When do I activate the shield?" If every power ability coolsdown after very long 25 secs you cannot reuse it in the meanwhile. But you can improve your values in the upgrade screen after each round. Payed with in-game gained levelpoints (max 6). The background graphics look very fine. But the gameplay can be quite repetive if you must try over and over again the challenging levels and collect all of the needed quasars. Escpecially challenging are bossfights which are like a bullethell or dodging around sucking-in blackholes.","December 19, 2015","true","4.5"," 31 of 40 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","31","40","3","0"

Being an on the rails shooter bullet hell type game without weapons, you can imagine it became incredibly frustrating, very quickly. That frustration amounted to full blown hatred of the game, the 120 second timer, the lack of weapons and only 3 special abilities... but... after about 3 hours of game time, I realized that although I wanted to smash my head against the wall, I was actually enjoying trying to get 100 Quasars on each level (the white orbs you collect to win the level.... you need 100 on each level to fight the bosses). Sometimes the game seems impossibly unfair and about as challenging as walking to the moon on glass shards but when you finally succeed, you feel like you truly accomplished something that not every gamer would be able to do.  At this point, I've beaten the first nine levels and I'm on the second boss and I think I've met my match but considering I at first despised this game and now I've come to respect it, I'd say it's worth the money.\nPros:\n-Hard, omg it's so hard\n-Pretty nice graphics\n-Winning feels like ejaculation. It's just wonderful.\n-Easy to learn, with abilities that can save your ♥♥♥... a lot.\n-Lots of unlockables\n-Later levels become insanely fast\n\nCons:\n-Oh my flying spaghetti monster, this game is so ♥♥♥♥ing hard!\n-No weapons (you're meant to survive without getting hit, even in boss fights)\n-120 second timer. That doesn't sound very long but when you've got about 5000 rocks about to smash into you, it is.\n-It'd be nice if there was an "easy, normal or hard option" because this game defaults to ♥♥♥♥ING INSANE\n-I know the story isn't a huge focus and from a fiction stand point is fine but scientifically it's like what? No more suns in the whole galaxy? Coooooome ooooon.\n\nFinal Verdict: If you like to rip the veins out of your arms one by one using a Toothpick then this game is for you. Bullet Hell types will find a lot of enjoyment here, especially out of the boss fights which really add in variety to the base gameplay. And if you're going to buy this game, don't judge it based on the first couple of playthroughs, get all the abilities and play to the first boss and then judge it. Recommended for the masochists out there.\n\nGameplay Footage:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65QaMgjknVQ","December 5, 2015","true","9.7"," 24 of 29 people (83%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","83","24","29","7","0"

Story is simple, but interesting.\n\n\nGraphics: 7/10\nThis is a 2D game, so there isn't much to talk about, effects are nicely done and backgrounds are pretty. I didn't notice any weird designs or graphic glitches. I have an AMD Phenom II X4 3.4 GHz and Nvidia GeForce GTX 650 Ti, and game is working on 60fps without frame drops.\n\nGameplay: 6/10\nGameplay is fast-paced and kinda hard, you have to collect quasar while avoiding meteors and enemies. Controls are simple, you move with arrow keys and you use shield with Q, slow time with W and use gravity with E. You can upgrade those powers in the upgrades menu, upgrades are nicely balanced so you are not OP. There are 3 bonus levels that you unlock as you progress in the game. The thing that bothered me is that ship feels dull and unresponsive so it's hard to steer it and avoid meteors and stuff, it would be easier if this game had a Xbox 360 controller support. And when you start the level, there is an intro and game suddenly starts after the intro, I think that it would be better to have something like a 3 second countdown before the game starts because it's a really fast-paced and all sort of things start happening suddenly.\n\nSound: 7/10\nSound effects are nicely done, voice acting is really good for an indie game and soundtrack is ok, nothing special, but it fits the game nicely.\n\nEnjoyment: 7/10\nI personally enjoed this game, it's hard, it's fast-paced so something is always happening, but it gets repetative after some time, but I got back to it after a break.\n\n\n\nFinal score: 6.8/10\nI don't like games like this, but I like this one, it has some things that can be improved, so I hope that developers will get to it and make this game even better. I recommend this game if you like stuff like Space Invaders, Ballpoint Universe and Really Big Sky.","December 3, 2015","true","6.1"," 17 of 24 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","17","24","2","0"

Instead of focusing on combat, the main goal is to collect an energy source for Earth called quasars. Gameplay is mostly dodging asteroids and activating skills to make that task easier. There is a shield that lets you smash through the asteroids, a time freeze, and an auto-loot skill that collects all quasars on screen. Collecting certain amounts of quasars awards points to spend to increase the duration or reduce the cooldown of the skills. Ranking in the platinum and diamond tier on each level will unlock new ships which each grant additional cooldown of the skills. After 4 levels collecting quasars there is a boss round where you dodge the attacks until an asteroid hits them.\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/422250/\n\n═══════════════════════════════════\nPROS & CONS\nPros\nAtmospheric music is very relaxing\nThe graphics are rather good\nThe hitbox is very precise enhancing the skill based aspect of the game\nController compatible and responsive (recommend using a controller)\nControls can be reconfigured\nCons\nDeadzone on the joystick could be better to prevent ghosting\nThe difficulty increase from level 4 to the bossfight on level 5 was unexpected\nOnly 15 levels\n═══════════════════════════════════\nSUMMARY & FINAL RATING\nThis game is rather fun, and the choice to leave out combat makes for fewer things to distract the player. Rather relaxing play. Avoid if easily frustrated. While it has only 15 levels there are bonus levels that are endurance focused with steam leaderboard rankings. This game is listed at about $8 USD and personally I would value this game at $5-6 USD. If you absolutely love bullet hell then this may be a great deal for you, otherwise add it to your wishlist so you can be notified when it goes on sale.\n\n8/10\n═══════════════════════════════════\nFor more recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow  Lot's O Giveaway's  group curations  here !","February 29","true","2.2"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cylarne04/recommended/422250/","cylarne04","Lord Cylarne","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cylarne04/","44 products in account","The game shiplord has lots of potential. It has boss fights, tons of missions, tons of upgrades to upgrade your ship, and if you live long enough, the game might be really enjoyable. As it stands below:\n\nStory/campaign: 7/10\nGraphics/art: 9/10\nAI: 10/10 (Simplistic which is why 10)\nFunctionality: 10/10\nContent: 8/10\nGameplay/mechanics: 5/10\nControls/navigation 6/10\nReplayability: 5/10\nWorth the buy? 7/10\n\nNow, this game has a lot of potential indeed. All it needs is more beginning game gameplay, getting new players hooked, and you're onto something. Surviving though through the first say two missions is not a piece of cake. So here are my suggestions:\n\n1. Instead of making it so you die in one hit, restart the game, implement LIVES or... health? Like you get hit once, you have a chance on living, twice, you go "oh no, one life left!", third, dead. Right now, it is frustrating, especially what I am going to tell you about below.\n\n2. Level requirements. Moving to level 3 requires 71 quars (or whatever they are called). If you don't have 71 quars, you cannot move on, that is it. Even if you get through this level at current alive, you cannot move on and you are stuck. What I recommend, PLEASE make quars a side quest. Say you get 71 quars? You get a GOLD MEDAL or you get 3 new upgrades, then move on regardless. Right now you can't. If you have a rough time surviving the mission and you achieve the 71 or so quars and then DIE... you'll get pretty mad.\n\n3. Shields. Needs some rework or a displayed timer on it or increased time value for how long your shields are up. Right now, you have like two seconds to destroy rocks. If you run into a rock at 2.1s without any upgrades (mind you, you only get ONE per level) you die. Like immediately. The shield mechanic is very wonky and along with the one hit you die system, the shield is more hazardous than useless.\n\n4. Upgrading needs to be reworked. You only have 1 upgrade per level (if you make it with required quars). And if you DO upgrade? It's pretty lame of an increase. Like 1 second recharge of something to .999 second recharge? Or use of shield is increased from 2 seconds to 2.1 second use? Pretty underpowering. Either give the player like 4-6 upgrade points (or maybe an upgrade after every 30-50 quars you get) so replaying levels will be worth it. Maybe add sounds or experience bars for making the player WANT to collect white dots (quars or whatever they are called).\n\n5. The controls. So far you only have the arrow keys. How about implementing movement with your mouse? Yeah? So far, the controls steer you off in hasty directions. Using the arrow keys can sometimes confuse your brain or whatever and I think the mouse integration, even better: THREE movement options, arrows, mouse, AWSD keys would do the trick quite nicely. Especially when your shield is the Q key and right there next to the WASD, very good. Just work on movement a little more if you want WASD and arrow keys really functioning.\n\nIf you improve those 5 points, like patch your game, update your game, and make good gameplay out of this, it will double or triple your player base. I know because gameplay is everything, not graphics. And with decent graphics like this, it will make people want to play this game. But not only you have to achieve the 5 points above. If you want to be super famous, you will of course have to do more, but that will be easy if you complete the 5 bullet points above. With all that said, and your content, and your over the top multiple missions, this will be a great game.\n\nHopefully this review will help the developers. For standard readers, I'd give the developers a chance to improve this game a bit more, I know I would if I was the owner. Is it worth the buy right now? Maybe for 5 dollars. It is worth a look. Will you have fun? Maybe after you get past the beginning, keep in mind though, dedication is key in this game.","February 23","true","0.3"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

Since it isn't the main goal of the game, I'm gonna forgive it for its simplicity.\n\nGRAPHICSThe game looks surprisingly really good: the design of the ships is neither too detailed nor too simplistic, and the asteroids are mostly varied from one another. The background is gorgeous, with planets rotating and stars shining. However, more than once I confused an asteroid for a background planet, and vice-versa, resulting in my instant death, forcing me to turn off the planets from the Options menu to avoid further dying.\n\nGAMEPLAYYour goal is to collect as many Quasar as possible while avoiding asteroids. You also have three abilities to use: a energy shield, a force field that stops the massive rocks in their tracks, and energy collection that instantly attracts every Quasar that has spawned. You will also battle bosses, which consists in avoiding their attacks for a certain amount of time.\nAs you can see the gameplay is very simple and easy to master. It is very reminiscent of some good old space games that managed to be both fun without requiring complicated mechanics and big variety.\n\nCHALLENGEThe game gets harder and harder the more you play: the speed and amount of asteroids increases, and each boss has a precise pattern that you must follow to avoid being insta-killed.\n\nSOUNDThe electronic soundtrack is pretty decent, and both sound effects and voice acting do their job. For being a first-time developer, it's pretty good.\n\nREPLAYABILITYThere are 15 levels, as well as bonus ones, different skins for your ship, upgrades that feel a bit useless, and 9 Steam achievements for completionists. However, I believe that once you've beaten the game, you won't feel the need to go back to it again.\n\nOverall, the game is a good space avoid-er that fans of the genre must play. If you aren't familiar with them, I recommend waiting for it to go on sale, since it is pretty good in it of itself, with some good-looking graphics and easy gameplay.\n\nStory: 6.5\nGraphics: 7.5\nGameplay: 7\nChallenge: 8\nSound: 7\nReplayability: 7\n\nENJOYMENT: 7\nFRUSTRATION: 7\nFollow me on Twitter: @nickygra97\nSubscribe to my channel\nLike on Facebook\n{LINK REMOVED}Check my official website\nJoin my Steam group","December 17, 2015","true","4.9"," 14 of 23 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","14","23","2","0"

I also like challenging space shooters. I like the concept of this game as well. What I don't like is that it only supports keyboard functionality. Yes I know that it's meant to be that way to give us that retro feel but personally I think it makes the game way too challenging for my taste. Making a game challenging for diehard fans is ok in my book but making a game impossible for the vast majority is not something I agree with.\n\nI used the Xpadder 5.7 app to even get the scores that I did. This game definitely needs game controller support.\n\nUPDATE: There is controller support now but it still won't work in Boss fights. Hopefully the upcoming updates will fix this. I like the tweaks that have been made to make this game very enjoyable so far & I like the fact that we are being heard. The continued improvements the dev team is making on this game have made me change my vote to positive.\n\nShiplord gameplay video:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=567887193","December 3, 2015","true","3.7"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

I try to only review games I think I'll enjoy.\n\nShipLord is a side-scroller with a novel approach to level progression. Put simply: no weapons! Instead, you must quickly and carefully manoeuvre your spaceship to dodge incoming asteroids and enemy projectiles. You will be rewarded if you collect enough energy orbs along the way too.\n\nHelping you to survive the onslaught of asteroids are 3 abilities: a shield which provides temporary invulnerability, a force field to slow down time and repel asteroids and a tracor beam\n\nthat pulls energy to your position. They're all upgradeable too, which is a nice reward between levels. Unlockable ships and bonus levels provide some extra incentive to score highly.\n\nIt's simple, addictive and exhilerating gameplay which quickly becomes challenging, not only because of the tricky asteroid projectories (and sneaky ultra-fast moon rocks!) but also due to\n\nthe lack of mid-level checkpoints. They wouldn't make much sense here however, because levels consist of surviving for "only" 1 minute or so. Expect to repeat some levels a few times until you learn when and where the troublesome asteroids pop up.\n\nLike the regular levels, ShipLord features inventive boss encounters too. For example, you must defeat the first one without using any abilities. Better hope your dodging skills are well-honed!\n\nMusic and sound effects did not have much of an impact on me, but some of the voice acting is done well.\n\nGameplay is very smooth and it feels nice piloting the sapceship in and around the obstacles while collecting enough energy your nerves can risk going for. The 3D planets orbiting in the background are a pleasant distraction.\n\nTo summarize: the presentation is very nice and good attention to detail is evident throughout. Just1337 Studio have conceived an original game and executed it very well. This is only their\nfirst release, so I would keep a close eye on Just1337 Studio if I were you!\n\n\nGiveaway here (ends December 31st 2015): https://www.bobmanbob.com","December 15, 2015","true","5.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It would be better if you are able to play this game with a Mouse or a controller.\n\nThe arrow Keys on the keyboard is not working super great. Esepcially if you have to avoid things in a fast paced game\n\nYou are able to upgrade your ship by reducing or increasing some time.\n\nMusic is calm all the time, but it doesn't feel there is alot of variety into it.\n\nThe graphics are okay, background is interesting.\n\nThere are multiple Ships and challenges.\n\nThere are "power abilities" Like shields, slow time, or energy collecting.\n\nThere are some lack of additional information, like What each uprades really do or meant. Or how many you need to earn a medal.\n\nSome of the Texts has a very small font.\n\nThe game always start at 120 seconds (2 minutes) and can't be increased.\n\nThere is a notification speech when a ability is ready for use.\n\n\nObjective about the game\n\nYou are a Ship and you have to collect white energy cells around space and avoiding incoming projectiles and asteroids.\n\nThe game does feel repetive after awhile, because the only thing what you are doing is collecting energy cells and avoid projectiles.\n\nYou need to get Gold medals in order to proceed further into the game. Gold medals are required in order to start the Boss.\n\nYou need to get all gold medals or higher in the previous levels in order to unlock the boss.\n\nDuring a Boss Level you will encounter the "Mini bullet hell". The boss will spam projectiles and you have to avoid this.\n\nBut above all, You have to survive until the timer is up. That counts for every level!.\n\n\nAbilities/upgrades\nThere are Several Abilities and upgrades in the game.\n\nDecrease energy Spawn time - This will increase the white energy cells spawning. (although 3 is max on the screen each time\n\nDecrease Shield cooldown - I think this is one of the most powerful ability. This should be one the first upgrades to be maxed out.\n\nIncreases shield time - This will increase your shield time duration.\n\nIncrease Slow time - I find this ability of slow really useless and i rarely use it myself, but your slow time will be increased once activated.\n\nDecrease slow time cooldown - Once again, i find this ability useless. But You can use this more often once upgraded.\n\nDecrease energy collector cooldown - Once used all current energy on the screen will be teleported to you. Upgrading this is useful.\n\n\nOther things\nSometimes i feel the hitboxes arent that connected. and other time they are pixel perfect.\n\nOn Level 9, at some point the level seems to stop moving in the background.\n\nThere are no difference in other ships, All ships are exactly the same beside the color and name.\n\nAsteroids will be bouncing and rotating when they bump up each other. Which can slow them down or speed them up. or make a lined up barricade which is impossible to go through without a shield.\n\nSlowing down the time, will have effect on asteroids, while standing infront of them, they will get pushed back.  once below , they will stop moving. They will get pushed from the opposide u are - so if ur left, they will get pushed right.\n\nThere is a skip button to skip the chat/speech text but not automatically you have to do this manually everytime, let alone turning it off, which could be annoying at bosses sometimes.\n\nThe projectiles from the second boss is very difficult to see, because of the background color. They are even blackhole proof.\n\nBlackhole sprite isn't actually correct, if it is a small black dot, growing slowly. The hitbox of the little black hole is already big, which could be confusing by the actual graphics.\n\nBoss 2 is almost impossible to beat. Because of heatseeking missiles, especially when he is doing the second projectile wave spam. So using a shield is a requirement here.\n\nThe last row of levels seems to be very luck based and they are extremely super difficult - nearly impossible. What i mean with luck based. That you are not getting a line of asteroids from top to bottom and you don't have a shield to go through. (look at the screenshot below)\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=569319753\n\nI will give this Game a 6/10","December 5, 2015","true","5.9"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

I started playing this just to kill some time, but then it became something much more.\nThe game develops nicely and with the time you put in, it becomes more and more rewarding. Story is catching, mechanism is nostalgic and old-school (in a good way ;)) and all this combined with today's graphics and design makes it into one of the best available games in this category.\nIf you like easy, time killing, monotone games - this is not for you. It takes skill and finesse to get to the higher levels and when you do get there, it gives you a special kind of satisfaction that only a few games can provide.\n\nTo sum it up; It's originality and clever development make this a fine addition to Steam. Calling this game just "an arcade" is not descriptive enough to explain even in the slightest what this game provides.\n\nBest advice I can give to anyone who's even a little interested in this is to give it a shot - you will not be disappointed.","December 6, 2015","true","0.4"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

If you're going for Diamond on every level you'll be in for some ride, though... A ride that's not really worth it. The boss fights (on Diamond) are frustratingly hard, and not for the right reasons. In order to win, you need to combine skilled gameplay (good) with memorization (not that great) and some luck (bad). This would not have been so bad if the controls were better, but they are not suited for precise maneuvering. Many good bullet hell games will let you slow down your movement by holding a button, but ShipLord doesn't let you to that, which means that you'll crash into projectiles that should've been easy to dodge.\n\nA lot of the time I felt like I died not because of error I made but because of flaws in the game. Sometimes astroid formations are nearly impossible to dodge, and sometimes astroids spawn just as you pick up a point at the edge of the screen. Oh, and points sometimes spawn inside of astroids, making them hard to spot until it's too late. If you're unlucky they will spawn at the opposite side of the screen, thus not giving you enough time to pick them up unless you use "Energy Collector".\n\nThe graphics, story, and voice acting are all below average, and there are a few grammar and spelling mistakes in the game. The game would've been better if it were in 2D and it would've been better without any story or voice acting, though that's a minor complaint.\n\nI give this game a 6 or a 7 out of 10. It is not entirely without merit, but there are so many better games out there, and unless you really like the genre I recommend you skip it. I had some fun with it, despite how frustrating it could be at times. It might be worth picking up on a game, but it's a very unpolished game that has a lot of flaws.","March 4","false","7.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

With upgrades, you can incrementally improve your ship's various abilities to complete levels, such as increasing your shield duration or decreasing the time it takes for each ability to recharge. At the start, you only begin with your ship and no abilities at all. This made the first couple of levels a little boring to play, but things quickly ramped up in levels after that.\n\nIt seems like a bit of a big download at 8GB, at least to me. But, there are literally a TON of levels to unlock and progress through. Over all, I think this was a really fun game to play, and well worth the cash.","December 3, 2015","true","5.2"," 8 of 16 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","8","16","0","0"

Level after that is the same thing.\nHit something and restart the level.\nIt seems really repetitive and not much fun at all.   There does appear to be a couple boss levels, but I didnt play that far because after my ship exploded randomly for no reason for the 5th time, I just didnt want to replay these tedious levels anymore.   Nothing hit my ship, it just blew up... random chance isnt something I can improve on and definitely not something I want to rely on here.","December 23, 2015","false","0.5"," 8 of 16 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","8","16","0","0"

It's a dull collect-a-thon where you dodge random dodgy looking rocks and collect white stuff until a timer says you can stop. It's "boss fights" are frustrating too thanks to float-y controls.\nIt also looks and sounds  mediocre. Definately not worth the full $9.99, spend your money elsewhere.\nOh, and for transparancy the developer offered me a free review code.","December 25, 2015","false","1.4"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","0"
