I will update this later after a couple of full seasons.\n\nIs this game fun? Yeah I would say so. If you like Motogp then it does what it needs to (just).\n\nIs it much of an upgrade to Motogp 14? Nope, not really. Cosmetics and small tweaks only (so far).\n\nShould the die-hard Motogp fans buy it? Absolutely, it has a nice feel to it and obviously it is updated with this seasons riders and such. It is still very much lacking in features that other driving sims have, hell even other sport games. But for the motogp series, it is slowly getting better...very slowly though.\n\nShould casual players buy it? That depends on if they have any previous instalments of the game. If they have 2014 I would say no, wait for next year. It is another of those games that only get small adjustments each year so just buy every other one or grab it on a 50% sale later in the year. I do not honestly think It is worth shelling out all that cash each year for a casual player on a game that always seems much like it could just be a DLC to the previous year.\n\nPro's\n\nThe bikes seem to be a little bit more responsive this year in cornering(motogp at least), it is fun to leave some black lines out of corners and pull wheelies on the  moto3 bikes. Nothing you would really notice unless you have played motogp 14 within the last couple of days but it is there.\n\nSlight wind wobble on the camera at high speeds, that seems to have been updated for this year and gives it a more realistic feel.\n\nCustom bikes in career mode. It's not all singing and all dancing but it's about time we got this feature.\n\nSeeing dry lines appear towards the end of a drying out qualifying session is nice. Yeah it may be 2015 and this should not be a surprise in this day and age but it still gave me a little lip curl.\n\nCon's\n\nThe AI seem to fall off very easily if you bump them. I have noticed this while giving the game a try on medium AI so I will update this a little more when I try out the pro settings a little later.\n\nIt really isn't the best racing sim out there, it's more aimed at giving the motogp gearheads their fix for the year and making milestone some money. The same company also make Ride and the MXGP games and they are all pretty poor bike sims so dont get your hopes up for an amazing game.\n\nMy rider looks way too shiny in the wet. Graphics wise this game is still pretty poor, I don't see much of a difference on last years edition and some tracks look pretty empty.\n\nSome strange sound effects... like crashing for instance, it just doesnt sound like it should.\n\n--\n\nAll in all, Milestone need a good kick in the butt. Motogp still doesn't have a brilliant game like it should. If you like Motogp you will enjoy playing this game. It is not total crap like some would say but it is not much of an improvement on last year, just as last year was not much better than 2013. For me, it feeds my need for bike racing and as I said before, if you are a casual player, just buy it on a sale or every other year.\n\nFor what this game is, i would say 8/10 this year. Milestone need to try harder next year though.\nJudged against other racing sims, pfft 6/10\n\nI will recommend for now\n--","June 24, 2015","true","36.4"," 94 of 125 people (75%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","75","94","125","4","12"

Now the problem is that the bike creates the slide, and I try to avoid it"\nin my case, in GP14 i create that slide/skid into the corner, but now GP15 bike creates that slide then i crash, lol\ni still prefer GP14's physics, but yeah its a good game overall...\n\npros :\n- better graphics, effects, so on. but color is kind of strange in shadow (assen starting grid), & in the rain\n- AA is back but not great, 8x AA the jaggies still present tho\n- more detail circuit, but Laser scan circuit on Project Cars & GRID/F1 is more acurate\n- wet race is more easier & fun\n- tyre wear is more forgiving than gp14 on 5 laps race distance (online race) didn't tried on 10/15laps yet\n- trading cards :P\n\ncons :\n- its Milestone, we need Codesmaster to takeover MotoGP\n- no steamworks\n- MotoGP bikes strange corner crash (eg: Brno turn5 right handed, PI turn6 siberia..) Moto2/3 is fine\n- weird start > gear one, i just pull the throttle 100% (tcs off), the engine seems to cut the power instead of wheely? the start isnt challenging anymore\n- the transmission doesnt feel seamless, just like RIDE's production bike\n- crash on wrong place & still got penalty (i dont have any intention to take a shortcut, doh!!!)\n- 1.5gb vs 4gb texture, dont notice any diferent\n\nupdate :\n- if u hosting a lobby, randomly freeze during the race still present (since gp13-14), if this happen on the long straight is np, but if in the mid-corner its disaster, ur bike go straight into the wall/speedtrap gravel or high side crash instantly!! (u loose the battle with other rider or even the chance to fight for the victory/podium at least) not happen in every race but can happen 1-2 times in single race...\n- uh uh one more thing, my question just got answered by the recent event (Assen race)\ni'd been thinking for a long time if this stuff really happen in the real race, but hey it does!!\nIts kind of failed 'superman' freestyle trick on x-games then stupidly hanging off the side of the bike sooo clumsy & nothing u can do really (need to wobble 1st, but u know what i mean :P).\nMoto3 rider Niklas Ajo shows stunning commitment, crossing the finish line on his knees after a spectacular save.. Happen a lot to me tho since gp13, but after fantastic Ajo's happening, its a big relief (i thought milestone was trolling about this) fiuh...","June 27, 2015","true","171.6"," 37 of 43 people (86%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","86","37","43","4","4"

I use onboard view and in moto 3 I cant see a thing through the near solid grey flyscreen. Basically its impossible to ride in this view. I have been using this view for years. So far this expirience has been terrible for me. Also the graphics are just as bad if not worse than the last motogp. Engine sound is terrible too... maybe slightly improved? Comparing anything of this game alongside the detail and sound of games like project cars its just terrible. I really dont know what to say! Milestone never help the people who have had problems yet give them the money for these games. I think most importantly Milestone are the issue here.

The ducati motorcycles are known for there power, but they are unstable. and the suzuk motorcycles have good handling, but down on power.\n\nOverall Its a good good espically at this time being that its  a few bucks off original price.  RIDE was a good game but it had a good set of problems, even know there were more selctions of bikes the problems did not out weigh them. For instince the online racing has yet to be fixed from glitches, so after you play the story mode. (which will take about 60-70 hours) I was wanting to play in the onlime servers, but they were so glitchy, and there was only a total of like 10 people online so it was impossible to find a match. I was worried Moto gp would follow in the footsteps of ride, but I have NEVER experinced a glitch on moto gp 15, I had some timing problems when exiting the pit, but thats it.\n\nGood buy, would recomend espically for the price.","September 14, 2015","true","105.6"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","16","19","0","1"

Handling is also a bit better and it isn't as forgiving as last year's game. Apart from that there's a few new game modes but nothing really spectacular.\n\nAll in all, if you already own MotoGP 13 or 14 I wouldn't consider it worth the £35 since you're basically getting a slightly less buggy and better looking reskin of 14. If, however this is your first Moto GP game, definitely pick it up. It has a really fun career mode which will keep you entertained for a long time and a bunch of other fun gamemodes if you get sick of career mode.","June 24, 2015","true","10.8"," 37 of 57 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","37","57","2","0"

If you're interested in racing games, be sure to have a look.\nIf this review is too long for you, I suggest you to only read the first paragraph about the game's content and the final verdict at the end.\n\nWhat is happening in the game:As you probably know, the point of this game is to race and, if you're good enough, win the race. With diverse customisation, you are able to modify your vehicle just the way you want. There are a lot of tracks to drive on and also games modes, including instant race and championship. Well, it's exactly what you would expect from a racing game.\n\nPros:    I can't go past the graphics in my review. You might think that the screenshots are much better than the actual gameplay (as publishers usually make screenshots look astonishingly good), but in this case, the truth is not far behind. On several graphic options, from low to high, the game looked good.\nThe driving feels nice. I had some issues with controlling the vehicle (will be described in the Cons section), but when I fixed all the issues, my driving experience was excellent.\nThere are 18 tracks in this game and, as I understood, all of them are also a part of the real 2015 championship.\nIn case you need one, there is a pretty decent tutorial when you first start the game with the announcer guiding you through the game mechanics.\nSome AAA companies these days are obsessed with DRM, but that doesn't seem to be the case in this game. You can freely play in offline mode any time you want.\nBoth your motorcycle and your outfit can be customisable with different colours, numbers and texts.\nThere are also different weather conditions.\nCons:    The controller is a driving device by default and the game wants it to stay this way. When I make the keyboard the default playing device, this setting is reset every time I turn on the game.\nIf you have a QWERTZ keyboard instead of QWERTY, as I do, you should know that this game detects Y, when you press Z. I had quite some problems with that, as the default braking key is Z and I couldn't even brake before I figured this out.\nAs I've heard, there is not much difference from this game and its ancestor (MotoGP 14).\nSometimes, bots fall of their bikes very quickly on contact. No biggie.\nNo MacOS and Linux support? Come on, we're not in the 19th century!\nThe final verdict:This game is awesome and, truth be told, I didn't expect anything else from an AAA game. Graphics are great, the feeling is great, the maps are great and controlling is great (after a few tweaks, if you have a keyboard). I had a lot of fun playing this and I don't consider myself the biggest fan of racing games. This game makes you excited when you play it even if you're not among the first on finish every time.\nBuy it if you can. You won't be disappointed.\n\nGreetings,\nBirdCute\n\nNote that my copy of this game was obtained for free for reviewing purposes.

The motogp series has always been worth a look at least. This version of motogp is one of the best so far over all.\nSure there are the odd niggle here and there , but i don't think I have ever played a perfect p.c game.\n\nConsidering motorcycling is not as main stream as car racing , no big company has reallly tackled motorbikes and racing to make a truly awsome masterpiece like grand turismo did etc. ... there was tourist trophy on Play station 2 but that was years ago and that game didn't have enough bikes really.\nI sure hope someone will produce a true bike sim , something like 'Project Cars' on p.c where the physics / graphics and sound can all be pushed to the maximum.\n\nThe sound could be better in this game considering we are in the year 2015. Over all though i would recommend this game to anyone who likes racing motorcycles and motogp. The graphics are great! the physics are not all too bad and the sense of speed and the smoothness of the game have been greatly improved.\nThe Rider animations have been improved on - now the Riders head moves properly in the turn and there is even more body movement - what this does is it gives you more scope to push every last drop of performance out of the bikes.\n\nThe edition of the old 990 cc Motogp fourstrokes dlc was a good idea , i loved thoses bikes when they came out and milestone has made a good model for these monster race bikes.\nAlso of note , there is a good difference between the years of the bikes in power and handling and in this version of the motogp game ALL bikes go really fast and are quite aggressive . In simulation mode it is easyer to highside the motorcycle.\n\nAs of writing this, i have put in well over 24 hours with this game and it still feels like I hav't scratched the surfice of the depth of the game as there are a lot of bikes and riders in this game.\n\n\nHey Milestone ! .... how about and upgraded version of your World Superbikes Race game sim.

So, I am highly impressed and recommend this game "IF" you like to play in first person view with no riding aids. There are always room for improvements, specially on the visual quality. But despite all the critisism Milestone developers get, they are indeed the masters of simulating motorcycle racing successfully. As they are the handful of guys creating such games, I am thankful to that :)\n\nPROS-\n- Handling is near perfect and refined. Physics feels really good as you progress from lower classes to higher ones. Handling is challanging but still fun.\n- Visually not that demanding and looks decent at fluid 60fps.\n- The game has high replay value. I find mastering corners and improving time in time attack mode quite satisfying. After nearly 80hrs, I am still about to start in moto2 from moto3 in career mode on simulation difficulty.\n- AI is quite good and competitive to play offline. Online community is quite challanging as well.\n- motogp madness experience...visually :) Loved the included multimedia videos as well\n\nCONS (so to say)-\n- It feels as if the PC version is not a priority and has been ported from ps4 version. Visually it can be more refined.\n- Online latency can be an issue sometimes. Also lobby rules and structure can be improved. Things like showing time left for qualifying sessions, ability to join qualifying in progress, skipping session and host transfer can be very helpful.\n- Inaccurate leaderboards. Times way lower than real records takes away the sim factor :P\n\nBoth "Ride" and "motogp" are good games. I play these games with xbox controller and have my G27 eating dust since I bought these. VR might change that. So I hope Milesone are also working on next version of their games with driveclub quality graphics and VR support.","March 28","true","156.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

Handling is challanging but still fun.\n- Visually not that demanding and looks decent at fluid 60fps.\n- The game has high replay value. I find mastering corners and improving time in time attack mode quite satisfying. After nearly 80hrs, I am still about to start in moto2 from moto3 in career mode on simulation difficulty.\n- AI is quite good and competitive to play offline. Online community is quite challanging as well.\n- motogp madness experience...visually :) Loved the included multimedia videos as well\n\nCONS (so to say)-\n- It feels as if the PC version is not a priority and has been ported from ps4 version. Visually it can be more refined.\n- Online latency can be an issue sometimes. Also lobby rules and structure can be improved. Things like showing time left for qualifying sessions, ability to join qualifying in progress, skipping session and host transfer can be very helpful.\n- Inaccurate leaderboards. Times way lower than real records takes away the sim factor :P\n\nBoth "Ride" and "motogp" are good games. I play these games with xbox controller and have my G27 eating dust since I bought these. VR might change that. So I hope Milesone are also working on next version of their games with driveclub quality graphics and VR support.","March 28","true","156.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

Selling ,as usual, full priced updates as games, to fix bugs from last year edition.\nOne of the most horrific aspects of the game is the sound engine. It's ear bleeding,far from real counterparts (alot far exept for Yamaha wich is "kinda" there) plus let me tell you one thing : Honda and Suzuki have 2 different engines and trust me, they don't sound the same...Milestone had the brilliant idea to put the Honda sound samples (that is not even accurate) for both bikes (wich btw suck hard). I really don't know where milestone wants to go with this policy but for sure they won't get anywhere close to their objective.  The controls are UNRESPONSIVE. The rider takes ages to lift from the lowest position when it's time to break hard before a turn making the back wheel lift all the time as the game engine recons the center of balance still in the front. And that's only one aspect of what's wrong in this game.\nIt seems the devs absolutely don't get how exactly a bike handling works, nor the physics around it. Poor set up options are also extremely frustrating, having a bar with no value for reference is a no go for a wannabe sim.\n\nToday I played sbk generations...I wish those days will come back. EVERYTHING about that OLD game is better than this crap and I'm, once again, extremely disappointed with Milestone.   Refund for me.\n","November 1, 2015","false","1.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

You are stuck and can't progress in this game.\n\nKnowing your game is litterred with bugs, I just dont have the effort to go look for a solution. Can I get a refund? NO.\n\n11/10 would crash again with MotoGP16.","April 21","false","6.9"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

The driving experience, the way to surf in the turns, MotoGP really provides a unique sensation of driving.\n\nThat sensation is still here in MotoGP 15. Great !\n\nBut, I remember in MotoGP 11 (on PS3) the very nice skies..., that is gone. No matter the sky condition you set (except for sunny) you end up with that boring exact same grey on cloudy, raining, lightly raining... no difference. No more of those beautiful sunbeams shining through the very nice big and scary clouds.\n\nThe Bike and some aspects of the tracks may look better, but might be only due to higher resolution.\n\nMultiple bugs... from sound bugs, making you stuck with the ugly startup line's engines for the whole race, to the ones making it impossible to properly go back in time : if you fell, and want to rewind, you can, except that sometimes, you'll automaticaly fell back as soon as you reset it... and you are not able to rewind again after that of course.\n\nAt the end of the day,\nI really enjoy MotoGP for the great driving and racing sensations, but it is in no way a game worth it's full price, it looks quite unfinished in some aspects. And I can't shake the idea that the 11 on PS3 gived a better visual experience than this one. Bying it at half price is a good compromise.","December 30, 2015","false","7.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I am not exactly sure what to say about this game exept that is an average racer. There is nothing exciting about it. Although the game is fun, it is a dull kind of fun if that makes any sense. There are sooo many things that you can do to this game to put it over the top to make it a one of a kind bike racer unlike any other! Everything about Moto GP 16 is just to freakin average. I haven't played any of this games predicessors other than the every first one and that was years ago. I do not need to play any of the older games in the series though...

There are only a few "custom" pre-rendered logos to choose from and they are some of the lamest logos that I have ever seen! I have seen high school logos with better appeal... Even worse... I have seen little league logos that ot class the lame cartoony logos of Moto GP 16! Custom logos was a big selling point for me when I was considering to buy this game. I am a graphic designer and I was hoping to God that I would be able to upload my very own custom logos, but nope! I'll say it again, the logos pffered in this game are horrible... HORRIBLE!!! YUK!!! A cartoon shark... C'mon man... Really?\n\nI haven't gotten far enough into the game to really experience the "custom" livery selection yet, but I am afraid that if they are comparable to the logos I am in trouble! Moto GP 1 offered some extremely cool liveries for the bikes and the gear. All of which you could manipulate the color scheme any way you wanted. Not just one color of one part of the pattern, but every color of the pattern. Enabling you to create several million different color combinations! It was highly unlikely to see anyone with the same color scheme and pattern wehn you raced online... Everyones was different... All of the time!\n\nOnline racing was also spot on in Moto GP 1. I haven't raced online with 15 yet, but I hope it is just as good. In 1 you could take your custom bile with your custom set up and race with it. If you are stuck racing a prefabed bike online I will be extremely dissapointed. If this is the case I will hang it up and put this game in the virtual garbage.

What a fantastic game. If you're into racing (watching F1 etc.) but you haven't played any serious games (I had invested serious time into arcade racing like the need for speed series) then you're in for a treat. Graphics are excellent. The tutorial is helpful. The career mode is compelling. All of the detailing in the game goes a long way. I really liked the race engineer. During your race weekend, when in the pits, you can speak with an engineer about the handling of the bike and he will suggest tuning a particular way to solve certain issues. It's a really fantastic way of teaching an inexperienced player which variables affect which characteristics. I'd recommend playing with the physics on pro but leaving the racing line on until you get the hang of it.","February 11","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And I do enjoy it, but playing with a gamepad or keyboard is almost impossible.  I need some settings for game pad to adjust dead zone as well as sensitivity.  Even if I partially push the stick left or right its all or nothing in steering.  This makes it very difficult to play with any kind of realism.

I assume most people genuinly interested in this title would have played the previous games as well. However the game runs smoothly as I've had no game crashes and my framerate is fully stable on medium settings.Visually it looks good, I always race with a helmet cam so how pretty the trees are does not concern me. In terms of physics the game is more forgiving than MotoGP 14. In some respects I really miss the challenging physics of Milestone's early SBK games, however this is still challenging enough.

Could have used a bit more animation scenes before/after the race and mre cosmetics for your racer, but it's good for what it has as well.\n\nDifficulty? Well, lets just say I was so happy that after a few hours of trying I started getting better at the game, and taking 1st places just to learn that the AI is set to Very Easy and I've been always playing with assist mechanic, meaning it automatically slowers my bick on corners and thucks for extra speed when I don't need to do any turns.\n\nIn other words, the game is well worth the price and if you're a fan of racing games, then you'll most likely enjoy this one too.","May 10","true","12.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As someone who rides motorcycles, the physics are solid. Must start your lean into a turn early, can't brake hard (esp back brakes) or pump the throttle hard while in turns or you will wipe out. Good learning curve and sim feel. Its very similar to game "Ride" by them as well, but they have some scenic routes.\n\nThe reason I am usually hesitant about the yearly racing/sport games, is because NOT enough changes from the previous years version. It would be good if companies gave discounts to those who own the past year. I have MotoGP14, Ride and MXGP/MXGP2. For for those with NBA 2K15 should get 16 for like 15% off same with NHL, Maddens imo.\n\nAnyways, this game is the best yet as should be expected and along with Ride is the best in its genre that I have played. It is a bit annoying to shuffle the track selections. I like how they added some hills or slopes to the tracks rather than all flat surfaces. I say its a buy, if you don't have the earlier versions and esp if on sale.\n\nI have been riding motorcycles (not racing) for over 15 yrs and this game seems to have that feel and physics down well.","April 18","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
