It uses the unity engine, but (because of the multi-platform release maybe?) looks a little bit like a flash game. You don't really drive, but you fly around a (magnetic?) pipe that represents the track. You can't fly off the track or get your plane to explode - if you hit a wall you're slowed, sometimes significantly, and that's all that matters.\nAs a mobile port - you need to gather stars to progress in the game, while you gather coins on the tracks to upgrade your plane or buy a new one. There are quite a few coins on the track, but I think there is a cap on the reward you can receive upon completion (250, 350). The music is reasonable, but, I think, I only heard like 2-3 tracks, so there is a room for improvement. The controls are fine, I used keyboard, and it worked great. Maybe an option to rebind the keys might be useful, but the default keys work just fine.\nThe gameplay modes are nice - the classic race is "ok", as the opponents are not the brightest, but Time Trail and Time Extension is where the game shines in my opinion, as you can always try and do better. A steam leaderboards for those modes will greatly benefit the game.\nAt the moment all available planes are the same tier, so I don't see a reason for buying a new one, instead of upgrading your plane with the money you get, but more planes and tracks are coming, according to the developer.\nWhat I personally really dislike, is that the game spins up all your available hard drives before start, and I find that really pointless and super annoying.\nComing off a Halloween sale and into a Christmas one, I really can't recommend the game for the full price tag, but then again I really do enjoy it, so I feel this dire need for a "wait and see / wait for sale" review option in Steam. Once the VR support comes and other cool features, I'll probably rework my statement.\nTL:DR you can see my overview / first impressions  video here :\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=337900202\n","November 6, 2014","true","2.1"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","1"

Using WASD to control you plane, you are some how magnetically tied to a spiraling pole that curves around the mini world you are racing in and forms a track. On this pole, there are powerups that you can use to boost you forward and away from the pole for a little time. The first race consisted of the classic, you against the bots, I was able to defeat it easily, but at the end, all of the bots behind me were throwing some kind of fireball things at me that when they hit hit, caused me to spin in a circle and lose speed. They only managed to hit me with this "power" at the end, but once I was hit once, I was an easy target for everyone, and all the bots were hitting me with it, causing me to spin endlessly, luckily, I was near the finish line, so I still finished first. That being said, I could not find where was my ability to use these "fireballs". Also, all the bots aiming at me got a little annoying, and it was only luck that I managed to spin myself over the finish line. The second race was a time lap. As I mentioned before, there are boosters on the 'pipe' or track that speed you forward, and in order to win, you just have to hit all of those and non of the walls rocks, or things surrounding the track. This immeadiately showed me that the controlabilty of the planes was just awful, however, it didn't matter since I think it was meant to be that way, by the beggining of the third lap, I was able to complete the course with the max 3 stars by memory, which was what the game wanted I think.\n\nOverall, not that bad of a game, for a pricetag of $2, there could be worst things on steam you could buy. You will get that "mobile port" feeling when you first start to play, but its not a bad game. Though I think i would pay a dollar for it.","November 28, 2014","true","0.1"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","2"

The tube is basically your 'road', you can't 'fall off' the tube but you can fly upside down and get boosts and ammo like most other party games like Sonic Racing Transformed. There are the usual kind of modes like Time Trial.\n\nThe game looks good and is pretty fun aswell but I *did* say it was a party game, right? This is suppose to be a game you could play with some friends or at least online and that's exactly the problem of Tail Drift at this point. There's no option to play multiplayer or even local with some buddies so basically what you get is a race game that's pretty fun but to me there should be multiplayer (and/or local), online leaderboards or at least some achievements, this game doesn't have any of that.\n\nHowever, the game is still in Early Access and it has the potential to become a fun game if the developers add the things I just mentioned and I will happily update this review.","December 17, 2014","false","0.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

A plane race game where the movements are only in the angle of 360ยบ on a tube seems nice and stuff... Anyway, it didn't catch my attention but I know to recognize the game's quality. Probably should be better and more enjoyable on tablets and smartphones.\nBy this price in comparison to the fun it provides I don't recommend,","December 3, 2014","false","0.2"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"
