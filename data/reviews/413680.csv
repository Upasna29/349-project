M'aiq enjoyed being chased by shy creatures who do not like eye contact. It reminded him of his sister, who also does not enjoy eye contact. It is a sore topic, do not bring it up.\n\n-Enough of a storyline to keep one's mind going. Not as deep as it could be, but it is well.\n\n-Khajiit thought that the game might have gotten repetitive after awhile, but the game threw new things at M'aiq and M'aiq was pleasantly surprised.\n\n\n\nCons:\n\n-The game was simply too short. M'aiq knows this is an indie game and indie games are short, but this could have gone on longer.\n\n-The blinking system is a good concept and necessary, M'aiq thinks, but it is more tedious than anything. Do not worry about playing on higher difficulties for a challenge, it only makes you blink more than a drunken Nord.\n\n-The carnival level. Khajiit actually stopped playing because it got too tedious running halfway across the land and back to get 8 firework boxes to which you can only carry one at a time. M'aiq thinks he can carry more than one box of fireworks at a time. M'aiq once carried three cases of skooma through a swamp, but you did not hear that from me.\n\n-The "statues" were not creepy. In the least bit. M'aiq has seen scarier things come from the Imperial Sewers.\n\n\n\nAll in all, with the cons of the game, M'aiq still finished it to the end. It is definitely a game worth playing, although wait for a sale. The length of this game does not warrant 10 septims.\n\n\n\nOne more thing, this game will make the player VERY aware of their own blinking.","December 15, 2015","true","3.8"," 122 of 163 people (75%) found this review helpful 143 people found this review funny","75","122","163","143","12"

No, not at all. This is just a horror game based off the Weeping Angels. If that has a better name, I don't know it. No idea if the assets are prebought, but they're not exactly a result of a lot of effort. All of the tables are copy pasted with the same objects on them. Everything looks like it's in plastic wrap, animations make no sense such as you sprinting while having the flash light on, implying that you are DOOM3MAN, a car crashes into you in the intro and it's just both vehicles stopping, and the whole thing reminds me a ton of Afraid of Monsters. It's creepy as sh*t, though. Buy it on ♥♥♥♥♥ or while on sale just to have a quick shiver down your spine.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sashadarko/recommended/413680/","sashadarko","Sasha Darko","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sashadarko/","1062 products in account","Status: 100% completed (on Easy)\n\nFirst of all, it's a modern horror game without a single screamer (kudos to developers for that). It's all about thrilling and intense moments, unexpected sounds somewhere near you and a constant fear to be captured by a statue.\nIt's a quite ambitious game, with some of most epic boss fights you could see in a horror genre (think of the last scene of F.E.A.R. and imagine if it was interactive). It can be a VERY frustrating game (mostly because of those boss fights), but it still hooks you and you want to beat it (which says a lot). Still, it has some flaws which may drive people away.\n\nLet's start with...\n\nPresentation:\n\nThe design is excellent: good font choice, clean and polished UI, nicely done note textures, etc.\nBut the graphics make the game look like a remastered PS2 game. Very low poly models and everything has a shiny parallax shader applied to it (i.e. even some garbage bag shines like it's Christmas). If you ever played Overcast then you know how it looks like.\n\nLevel design:\n\nSome levels are huge and feel like an open world (unlike many other horror games), some are just a straight line (with a boss chasing you). As for the open-ended ones, there are many copy-pasted segments, but if you pay attention you can see that they're still different. Despite having limited resources, there's a lot of care put into designing all levels and it shows. Probably the only complaint here is the placement of colliders and the last level would be the best example. It's very easy to get stuck on the rocks there while trying to run away from the enemies. One of them actually had the same problem, he couldn't past a statue blocking his way until I destroyed it.\n\nStory\n\nPractically non-existent. You have one mission: escape. And throughout the game you do just that – escape by any means, from everything: statues, Death, clowns, etc. You start in the hospital, but once you leave it, it's the whole city for you out there: mall, streets, park, graveyard, etc. Some of the things you do don't make any sense, but the ending (which is quite cliché) could explain why.\n\nSound & Music\nEvery sound sample in the game sounds fine, no complaints whatsoever.\nThe music is great and it always fits the events in the game. My personal favourites are the themes from Chapter 1 and 7.\n\nGameplay\nThe major part of the game is a blinking system. Some statue appears and starts following you, and then you blink, it supposedly teleports very close to you. If you just stand and it's very close, it starts to look at you back and it's game over. But playing on Easy mode and constantly running, I didn't really notice anything like that – statues teleport however they want and don't move only when you look at them. First version of the game didn't have any difficulty levels and was pretty much unplayable due to constant blinking (it just drives you nuts and you can't focus on what's happening around you, the screen fades to black for some time every 3-4 seconds, imagine playing like that not just one part of the game, but all of it).\n\nAnyway, you need to run. The game tells you if the statues are nearby by using the heartbeat sound. If it's slow, you still have the time (to run to some other place, for example). If it's very fast, you're probably already screwed.\nLately in the game you get a weapon which can destroy statues, but you still need to avoid all other enemies. It's not clear when you have the time to destroy the statue and when you don't – one moment you successfully destroy it, but then some other time you can be killed just a second before you make a last hit. If it's just one statue, most of the time it will be OK to destroy it. If it's 2 or even 3 (especially if it's 3-4), just run.\n\nEvery open-ended level has an objective for you, which is always the same: collect X items or activate X things before you can proceed.\n\nSo, the experience on these levels is like this: you're looking for objects (or switches) in the darkness with your flashlight, while trying to avoid the enemies (statues spawn indefinitely and it becomes a standard situation lately in the game to be followed by about four of them). The objects you need to collect are placed randomly, so you never know where to find them. It adds to the tension, but also can be frustrating, because they can be placed at some places you wouldn't think to check (like power boxes being in the clothing shop). But they're always highlighted and it helps a lot – if the angle is right, you can see them meters away in the darkness.\n\nNow, the major flaw of the game: it shows you an objective, but never explains HOW you do it. Most notable example which is impossible to figure out would be the first boss fight. The game tells you to run to the subway (the event takes place on the street). The problem is that there's a huge statue behind your back which pursues you and destroys everything in its way. OK, you run and for some seconds you're fine, but then you die – the statue grabs you and kills.\nOnly by watching a video on YouTube you can see that you need to hide in small spots behind the buildings waiting every time for the statue to suck in all cars on the street and make a massive “boom” (and only then you run). And even knowing this is still trial-and-error, in the end there's a moment where you need to run longer than before (which also will take some time to figure out).\nThe spots are not highlighted anyhow, there are no hints at all. You just need to know the way it works, there's no other way.\n\nTechnical\nAs for the technical aspect, the game never crashed and you can use Alt+Tab without any problems (the game also will stop the sound until you get back to it). The framerate is stable and mostly 60+ FPS, expect the second level, it's pretty laggy there (nothing game breaking, but just be prepare for it). There's also a constant unresponsiveness of the Action button, you need to press E several times on an object to trigger it, even if you're very close to it (you can see it in many walkthrough videos on YouTube). This one is actually can be a fault of Unity itself.\n\nOverall, it's a very solid horror game. Ambitious and captivating, sets to be epic and actually succeeds (despite the primitive visuals). It doesn't have screamers and relies on the atmosphere, sound design and overall creepiness. If only boss fights would have more hints what to do.\n\n\nReview key provided by the developer.\n\nSasha Darko for Game Obscura","January 5","true","6.7"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","9","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/supahjames/recommended/413680/","supahjames","TheGreenJacket","http://steamcommunity.com/id/supahjames/","225 products in account","To start, I have some mixed feelings about this game. First off, it was fun and interesting, not to mention scary, but there are certain things that this game has some problems with.\nFirst off, when it boasts "different types of enemies" mostly it means different designs. There are only really four different types. Some of the "7 various locations" you are in, you are in for less than a minute or two. Another problem I experienced was that I would get stuck in random places. For example, when I ran into a supply room I rubbed against some debris on the ground and suddenly I couldn't get out of that spot and had to restart my checkpoint. This happened several times, but sometimes this is unpreventable in games and it really didn't happen too often. Then there was the blinking. The blinking was a very interesting concept, one I have seen in several other games, but it's duration is much too long, almost two seconds. I don't know anyone who blinks for two seconds. But I suppose if they wanted to add it to the game they needed to make it to where it could really make a difference in your meeting with a statue. Another problem I had was the lack of information. For example;\n\n*SPOILER*\nAt one point you have to escape a massive statue, which I have nicknamed "The Divided," and as you run away from him he will every so often jump into the air and suck up everything in his path. If the player fails to be in an alleyway they will get sucked up and killed. I discovered what to do by complete accident after dying several times. This lack of information frustrated me and really took away from the game's experience. Plus the whole giant statue battle(s) really differed from the main game in an unattractive way.\n*SPOILER END*\n\nNow for the pros! This game was very scary. The first "statues" you encounter are skinless medical mannequins. These terrifying creatures will follow you, banging down doors until they catch you. The gameplay is very similar to Slender, but it does it very well. There are indeed several levels, each with similar but differing objectives.\n\n*SPOILER*\nOnce you are given the hammer, however, it becomes less scary and more of a challenge. You avoid the statues while collecting the necessary items, only now you can destroy the statues.....temporarily. I loved that addition and it certainly made it more challenging.\n*SPOILER END*\n\nThe game was also very beautiful. The graphics were smooth and everything was shaded very well. It is obvious that they tried very hard on the appearance of the game and it really sets the atmosphere.\nI bought this game on sale, but I feel that 10 dollars isn't too bad of a price for this game. But maybe buy it on sale. Again mixed feelings. I enjoyed certain moments, but quite a few took away from the experience. I suppose I would recommend it.\n\nFun 3/5, Scary 4/5, Originality 2/5, Mature 3/5, Graphics 4/5, Worth the price? 3/5","January 12","true","4.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The concept of the game is quite  interesting in the sense that the monster chases you  when you turn your back to him but when you face him he becomes immobile like a statue. Now you cannot face him constantly because each 10 seconds your eyes blink  for a few seconds and this is when he can snatch you. That being said  the main objective remains to avoid being caught by the monster and escape the premise.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDmF__e5p-Y&feature=youtu.be\n\nConsidering the price point of around 9-10$, I would not recommend this game. I would recommend buying it at around 5$ which seems like a fair price to me. However, if you are a fan of the genre and have money to waste be my guest.\n\nPositive:\n- Interesting gameplay.\n- Sound FX.\n- A few scary moments.\n- Saving check points.\n\nNegative:\n- Death is frequent and annoying in the first level.\n- The "e" use key feels unresponsive at times.\n- Blinking every 10 seconds becomes annoying in the long run.\n- Annoying low stamina.\n- Subpar graphics, no guns, no plot and no killing monsters.\n- Price","October 27, 2015","false","1.3"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","11","20","0","3"

And I don't mean an insanely obscure, highly illogical one such as that sported by another recent release such as, hmmm, let's say Bleeding Border (look it up if you're in the mood for a laugh)!!  No, this one is actually well-conceived AND well-executed, the agonisingly simple yet terrifying concept being that WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T TAKE YOUR EYES OFF THE MONSTER, OR IT'S GONNA GET YA!!!  Now, that might not sound so hard to master to all you smart-arses out there, but there's a catch...like all human beings, your character has to BLINK every now and then, and when you do...well, let's just say you want to keep your enemies at substantially further than arm's length, or it's COITAINS for you...\n\nA quick look at the other reviews on the Store page will tell you that not all players have been happy with this blinking mechanic, and while I'm inclined to agree that it maybe lasts a TAD long when you do actually blink, I can't really think of how the devs could have handled this premise much better.  What many of these reviews don't seem to address - now, perhaps it was something which was added after the game's initial release, I can't rightly say - but you're actually very much in control of WHEN you blink, so it's really a time management task of deciding when it's safe to do so, and in the meantime you'd best keep a vague eye on your blink-o-meter to make sure the game doesn't do it for you at the worse possible time!  It's all quite manageable, though, and basically requires two things of the player:  Strategizing, and NERVES OF ♥♥♥♥ING STEEL.  Good thing I was raised by wild wolves, in the forests of Transylvania no less.  Ain't NOTHIN' scares this wolf-boy...er, except really bloody creepy VIDEO GAMES like this one!!\n\nLook, it's not perfect, and it's not the single greatest horror game ever made, but if you play anywhere near as many horror games as I do, you'll surely be able to tell that it's several cuts above a lot of the sheer and utter DRECK which passes for "horror" product on Steam these days.  It's well thought out, sincerely executed, and while it's maybe a tad repetitive after a while, it at least it shouldn't attract much undue attention from the "this game is too short" crowd (a group who, as much as they ♥♥♥♥ me, do unfortunately have a point when it comes to a lot of recent horror games).  Nor is anyone - certainly not I! - liable to finish it all in a single sitting, 'cause the tension is so thick you could stifle puppies with it.  I personally found myself having to have regular breaks, 'cause it really is quite exhausting and nerve-wracking to never let your enemy out of your sight.  Oh, and the ending just flat-out SUCKS...it's too hard and almost rage-inducing in its sheer lack of save points.  But the first four-fifths of the game is frankly excellent.\n\nRecommended to anyone who likes horror games which require BALLS.  Personally, mine are pretty small, but I do have two of 'em, and that still puts me one ahead of Hitler.  Speaking of twos, it just occurred to me that this game can be summed up in two words:  Grandma's Footsteps.  But the scariest ♥♥♥♥in' game of Grandma's Footsteps you WILL EVER PLAY.\n\nVerdict: 9/10.\n\n(PS ♥♥♥♥ that ending, though...)\n\n(PPS No, seriously, the ending can suck my sac.

The statues are coming for you, but listen - your life could depend on this - don't blink. Don't even blink. Blink and you're dead. They are fast, faster than you could believe. Don't turn your back, don't look away, and don't blink."\n\nMy thoughts up to this point? Well, this may not be a truly terrifying game, but it's definitely a tense one. In a way, it's a terrible find key and escape style horror game, but a LOT of strategy is needed sometimes to keep your stalking foes at a distance. I spent a good hour looking for the key to move on to the next floor of the hospital, which I passed multiple times and missed due to the pursuing "statue". I actually resorted to mapping out the level in order to figure out where I had to due to all the additional rooms available to search.\n\nI do have some gripes at this point though. The walking is a bit awkward, and the blinking is abnormally long. I'd also love some key rebinding, as x to blink is oddly placed. Considering how key the dynamic is to the game, it really should be the right mouse button (since the left mouse button is to attack). Finally, the stagnant image on screen when you are caught/killed is just too long and should fade after two maybe even three seconds max.\n\nQuick hint, when trying to escape the wanna be weeping angels from Doctor Who, double or triple press the "e" button when going through a door. This closes the door behind you as you go through.\n\nOther than that, at this point, I do recomend this game if you're looking for an actual challenge. I also think the game itself is fairly simple, it's just the fact that you can't NOT look at your pursuers or die, mostly due to how fast they come at you if you turn your head or blink, is what makes the game seem difficult or impossible. Once you figure out how to navigate around these "statues", when to blink, and how to make the doors work in your favor, you'll be fine.\n\n**review key of this game provided by the Room 710 Games for all editorial coverage purposes**","October 29, 2015","true","4.0"," 11 of 22 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","11","22","2","0"

Meanwhile, inanimate manniquens or statues are coming for you while your back is turned. This creates an intence level of stress as you cannot leave your back turned for too long. It gets really hairy when you have to complete objectives that are on the wall so you're forced to keep your back turned, always looking over your shoulder.\n\nThe visuals are really well done, and the darkness creates a very creepy atmosphere that makes it difficult to see the oncoming threat. The auido is great as well, as you can hear (very faintly) the footsteps of the statues coming for you if you listen well enough. Overallm Statues is well done and makes for a very scary experience that is best when in the dark and wearing headphones. Just like any good horror game. I look forward to finishing the game soon.","December 3, 2015","true","1.7"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

I was only able to put in a couple minutes before I had to quit because of motion sickness.\n\nSomething about the FP in this game was nauseating and I couldn't continue past the hospital. I really wish I could continue, but completing the game isn't worth vomiting and a severe headache. So if you have rather bad motion sickness like me (as in, so bad that simply moving your head while sitting in a car is enough to induce dizziness), this game may not be for you.","April 6","false","0.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

You have a perpetually draining blink meter which will make you blink automatically, or you can refill the meter on your own.  The blink lasts for a full second, which is seriously immersion breaking given that you are doing it constantly.  I didn't even get past the tutorial section before that one thing annoyed me so much I had to uninstall the game.\n\nOn the plus side, this developer did include essential control options such as rebinding your keys and mouse inversion, which seems to be increasingly uncommon for indie developers.  Kudos for that :)","May 4","false","0.1"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

It seems like you'd just run around upon each level, avoiding the statues and quit the game once you get bored. Suprisingly, this isn't how Statues functions. The game is much longeer and much more elaborate than you may think at first glance of this game. Although, I don't wanna stray away from the reality of Statues, which unfortunately crumbles down over the time of playing.\n\nGameplayAlthough you may think that Statues is just another survival horror game, with barely any story or gameplay it really isn't. It's not the type of game whereby you simply selecte a level to play and just go and run away from these statues without any reason to do so. The stroy is a very simple one to understand and is told through sevral chapters of the game. The game starts in a very grab opening way. The player begins the game in a car, driving down a highway, when suddenly a cell phone rings. The player looks down to see who’s calling, blindingly bright lights direct our attention back to the road ahead. We see the car drive straight into a head-on collision with a large truck. Soon after, we awake in a hospital bed in pure darkness, adn this is where the gam starts off. At the end of each chapter that you finish, you are given a short inner monologue from the main character through journal entries. Although this is only the bare bones of the stroy of the game, there are additional hand-written notes that you can find scatted around each chapter to build upon the story more. It is to be noted, that finding these notes are entirely up to chance if you find them or not, unless you search them up on youtube to where they are. There is no indication to where any of the notes are as you play through the levels so finding them is completely optitional. The main mechanic of the game isn't exactly original, inspired by the 'weeping angels' from Doctor Who the statues won't move when you are looking at them. There is however a blink meter to prevent you from just staring at them all the time to win easily.\n\nGraphicsThe game itself isn't known all that  much, and that may be for the fact that the game looks like a normal horror game. When you first start the game, the game really shows you and puts up how well the graphics will look through the rest of the game. The graphics are gorgeous looking, from the lighting of the game to the detail of the cracks that you can see in the wall as you ply through the game. Although some of the textures seem to stand out to be slightly unrealistic going through the park the cobblestone path looks a bit unrealistic compared to the gorgoues graphics shown beforehand. You will unfortunatly notice though that the rooms in the hospital look almost the same as the rooms in the builidings in every other location of the game. So while the game can look spectacular sometimes, there are sometimes graphics that are repeated and get a little bit boring.\n\nMusic & SoundThe game is really good at setting the atmosphere of playing this game. There are some nice features in which when a statue gets near to you, the players heart beat begins to beat fast and their breathing gets louder and faster. This also combinded with some seriously tense moments that can occur throughout the game can really put you on edge and give you a nice atmospheric feel to the game. This also helps you get used to the mechanics of the game as you will be hearing that sound a lot if you are dying a lot in the game. Although, it does seem to string on a bit and you lose the tense sounds to the game itself.\n\nConclusionStatues is a seemingly unknown indie game title which seems to be a normal horror survival with minimal mechanics, but it is actually rather well done. The gameplay has its tense moments when you are near these statues with fast hearbeat and loud breathing, although this does wear off a bit once you have played the game for a while. The graphics are beautiful, although some textures seem unrealistic compared to other amazing looking graphics that you'll see throughout the game.\n\nFor more reviews on a wide range of games, go and follow Sometimes You Playing curator group here.","March 20","true","2.1"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

Bottom line, I took a chance... and well, not all that impressed at first glance.\nI get the point of this game (ie. patience to some degree and basically timing your moves); but for me, I just can't stand using a keyboard for controls.  I knew that going in with this game; but I'm a controller guy.  It feels like less of a game to me having to use a keyboard.\nI have to say no on the recommendation unless you buy it now for the $4.
