It has obviously been made with love and even though I only played it shortly I liked the voice acting and the whole atmosphere. The drawing style is just precious.","January 26","true","0.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

As long as it does'nt crash, I highly reccomend this! Hopefully there will come a day when it wont crash and I can give a proper review.","January 31","true","2.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Loved the atmosphere it created.\n\nPuzzles are not too hard, but very varied so not boring. They won't give much challenge to veterans, but at the other hand it makes game accessible to genre newbies.\n\nAs for other reviews mentioning constant crashes - I only encountered a single crash during my playthrough after alt-tabbing, so maybe it's already fixed ;)\n\nOnly bad thing I found about this game is that while it's story idea seems very intresting we're getting almost no backstory until almost the end of the game when we no longer care that much. Story has potential but should be developed through whoe game, not only in last 30 minutes.\n\nAnyway - it's still worth a try! :>","March 1","true","3.6"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","3","6","2","0"

I can see based on another review that it's a common problem with the game.\nI love this series and I think I may have accidentally purchased it on steam after already playing it on BFG. Oh well.\nIt would be nicer if it worked...","February 12","false","0.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","1"
