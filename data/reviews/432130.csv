With that said, I can offer an honest review of the game.\n\ntl;dr The game is great. The amount of content, quality of writing and artwork, along with an engaging story makes it easily a great game to pick up if you enjoy the genre or a good story.\n\nPlaytime/LengthThere is so much content in this game that your first playthrough will take you about 5-6 hours to get through alone. And with several routes to choose from, getting through all the main content will be thoroughly engaging and get you so much value for what you put into the game. I think a good way I’ve heard a way to describe the amount of writing in BCM is that its total length is about 3.5 Great Gatsby’s long. The game is filled with content.\n\nMusicThe music is open source, but it is used very well. The choice of song for any given situation is fitting and matches the ambiance of a scene. With a soundtrack of 33 songs, you will find a great amount of distinction between songs and it lends itself to framing a scene just right when you hear the fitting background music.\n\nVisualsThe artwork in the game is all stunning. From expressive character art to CG’s to backgrounds, the game certainly isn’t lacking when it comes to its visuals. BCM has gone through several visual updates during its development and the finished product shows how polished it is as a result. The user interface is sleek and appealing, fitting to the game itself. All art assets are incredibly done, deserving of high praise.\n\nWriting/GameplayI’m not very good with words myself, so I probably won’t do it justice when I say the writing is extremely well-done and high quality. The cast of the game avoids common archetypes and each person feels separate, yet complete in their characterization. You will undoubtedly find favorites and traits you love about each character since they reflect real people so well. The story flows fluidly and smoothly. Reading it is first and foremost, enjoyable. I could take my time to appreciate the details as well as things like the character development. Before you know it, it becomes engaging and gripping. Writing of this caliber is something more people should treat themselves to.\n\nAn important part of a visual novel such as this are the choices that are presented to the reader. Immediately, you can tell that choices matter and they make sense. You won’t ever find something arbitrary as deciding to go left or right and that making the story change on its head. Your actions have very reasonable, realistic consequences, which is something I think more works in this genre could adapt.\n\nI’ll fill in more details later, but do yourself a favor and get the game. It really is well-done in every aspect and it’s one of the best stories I’ve had the pleasure to read.","February 12","true","44.0"," 34 of 41 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","34","41","2","0"

I can't say that I fully understand every minor detail of what's going on in this game, even after playing through the whole thing multiple times. Might be tiny plot holes, might be my own stupidity, but nevertheless I'm not bothered by it in any way.\n\nThe story, the characters and the art style are brilliant. And while it might not be a romance focused game (although there's a lot of that too), it's definitely relationship and character developement focused. It's supported by a great story, but what ultimately got me hooked for hours were the relationships between the various characters. Every single character feels like a real person you can easily get attached to. My first playthrough took me around 6 hours, but it left me wanting to see everything the game has to offer. And yes, it got me to spend 4 hours trying to get Yuki's ending. Yes, I can see that by looking at the time of my achievements. 4 hours.\n\nI can only recommend this to everyone, and especially if you're into Visual Novels and / or relationship focused stories. Get it, seriously. It's so amazing.","February 18","true","28.3"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","11","11","2","4"

A bit complicated though, which is nice. Though it feels there are small, super tiny plot holes. But barely visible, if you do not focus on them, are they invisible. But it was something that gnawed in my mind, not much since everything else was dazzeling. The story as whole was amazing, and well thougt anyway!!  I really liked it, it was awesome and intressting!\nIts a bit tricky to get all the endings, but its still easy to solve too in the end. Also that there is a lot one can experience in it! To look around to find and see! A lot of scenes to get between Shuuki and the others, due to different requirements and mementos. That makes it replayable, though, the beginning gets a little bit tiring if you want a specific endig and fail, and then you have to go throug it again. Luckly there is a skip button, and it stops when a new scene occour, so you wont miss anything.\nThe writing is easy to follow and do not use many difficult words, and it still  manage to sound clever and pretty in the language, as it paints the situation in a simple, understandable way. But some sentences could have some rephrasing, but they are very, very few. And some things gets repeated,  its not often, and does not stand that much in the way either. Since the overall text is, as mentioned, well written.\nThe art is very pretty!!!! The shading is nice and smoot, and the lightning really highligts their details in a gorgeous way, like Shuukis hair. <3  And Shuuki is almost irritating pretty (in a good way), since my brain could almost not comprehend it, haha ,long wonderful hair <3 and I just stared at how pretty drawn he was. The colouring is beautiful everywhere! From the characters to their surrounding! The bakgrounds are also well drawn! I really like the style the artist have!\nThe characters are deep in personality, and nice <3 I like all of them <3. And they speak in a natural way, not forced or anything. And they can say really funny things to one other. xD And act in different ways, yet very caring. Also following Shuuki's personal change is nice!\nThe music is good, but I did not always pay attetion to it, it does not stuck in my mind or anything. It just nice for the moment. At times I listened, then it vanish from my thoughts, even if the music is still played in the game, it lost is grip. ( Can also be that I was mesmerized by Shuuki... haha. )\nBest of all ( In my opinion ), its boy x boy!!!! I have not seen this sort of VN on steam before! I have only seen Girl x Girl, and wondered, is there some VN with BL here on steam? Well here is one! And its awesome! They do not show anything, except for kiss scenes. And the relationships goes in a good pace. And can be very cute. If that is not your suit, then you do not need to pursue anyone! ( But you wont get all the endings if you avoid it. )\n\n10/10, is my say in this. I do recommend this! For its story, art, and .. BL, heee. <3","February 18","true","29.2"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","8","8","0","0"

I strongly recommend that people try it. It's got interesting game mechanics and I found it quite beautiful, story-wise, music-wise, and graphic-wise.\nIt took me a about five hours to play through the first time, and there is still so much to do, so many endings and extra things to unlock, so many things to see that I missed the first time around, that I'm going to be playing it for a while yet!\nI just really enjoyed this game, and I think if people gave it a chance, they would too!","February 17","true","13.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

On Steam I think I've only logged a few hours in BCM, but between testing previous patches and playing the itch.io build prior to its Steam release, I've logged 40+ hours of play and I'm still looking forward to more.\n\nSo!  With that said, if you're looking for a thorough, exhaustive review of BCM's strengths and weaknesses as a visual novel, Hanged Hourai's got you covered.\n\nFor my part, I’ll talk about BCM’s synergy between tight character writing and emotive character sprite design, because the characters really make this game something special.\n\nBetween the Amamiya brothers and the friends that orbit their complex familial dynamic, BCM presents people that are at once familiar in archetype and refreshingly unique in execution. The script is deceptive in its simplicity because BCM is a VN that doesn't outright demand more energy than you're used to committing to the genre. Character interactions are charmingly relaxing right up until they’re not. And while the game is built on the drama of death and time travel, it's the quieter moments that had me sobbing.\n\nEach character receives defining moments that reveal their three-dimensionality.  But it wasn't until much later that I realized I'd fallen in love with each one long before their respective interpersonal dramas came to a head.  And if you’re into shipping, there’s plenty of that to enjoy here — not just because the game itself facilitates romance, but because the characters are so well-rounded that practically any pairing here can make for pretty cool headcanons.\n\nAll this is not to say that nothing else is impressive here — the game feels effortlessly complete in no small part because of how the music, backgrounds, and UI complement the script and character design to create a bold, thematically coherent experience.\n\nBut the character revelations and conversations have stayed with me for months, and for me, that’s what makes this game more than worth its price.  Please buy it when you can!","February 20","true","2.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

I promise it will be worth your money.\nLong version of my recommendation:\nJust a note-I originally bought this on itch.io so even though it says I have not played much on Steam I have played pretty much all routes previously.\n\nVisual novels are a genre of game that I so want to love, but often feel disappointed or even borderline ripped off after playing them. There are some inherent flaws that I find about many of them including the fact that the characters often seem to be generic and personality-less and the "choices" you are given are either so obvious it is boring OR so random it becomes boring in another way.\n\nThis one does not fall into any of those traps. The main character is one of the most unique I have seen in a VN and, by the end of a scene or two, I really loved him. Halfway through the game and I was willing to play for hours to make him happy and eventually play a romantic end for him (which, the romantic ends are a bit tricky to achieve which I count as a positive. I like a challenge and, hey, its sort of like real life romance, right?). The other characters are also unique and likable. I like their design, their personalities, and they feel believable to me.\n\nWhat this game also does well that many other VNs do not is the process of making choices. You do have to think about some of your choices and your choices affect the routes in a way that is clear, but not so obvious as to be boring. It is a lot of fun to get some bad endings and then retrace where you made a wrong decision along the way that caused it. In a way, it feels realistic where choices have ripple effects and consequences, negative and positive.\nWhich brings me to another reason I love this game. So much playtime. Seriously, I have played through most of the routes by now, but I spent hours doing it, enjoyable hours. Sometimes I blow through a VN semi-bored in one night. Not this one. I feel like I got my money's worth and then some.\n\nIt is just a gorgeously designed game with characters that the creators obviously cared about and the design of the choice system is one of the best I have experienced in this genre in quite some time. It revitalized my interest in Visual Novels though now I feel bad for the next one I play because I have high expectations!","March 28","true","9.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

They all contain emotions, hopes and dreams, interests and quirks, and personal demons that they try to defeat in their own ways. (some more successfully than others) And you may find yourself surprised as you uncover their pasts and secrets.\n+ The main character grows and improves himself as the story progresses.\n+ 56 CGs. Including some cute chibi ones!\n+ Great morals about the importance of family, forgiving yourself of your past mistakes, accepting others despite their flaws, and trying to move forward one day at a time.\n+ You are able to rewind, meaning that you don't have to restart the game or load your last save if you missed something or want to click a different dialogue option.\n+ The characters blink, have different expressions to fit the dialogue and situations, and their outfits sometimes change.\n+ A Q&A with the creators.\n\nNeutral\n\n= At the beginning of the story, some people may find the main character unlikeable. Though he does become a better person as his life begins to drastically change.\n= While I personally love it when stories aren't afraid to talk about these topics, this visual novel contains dark themes that might turn some people off. (abuse, suicide, etc.)\n= Some think that the sprites look a little off in areas, but the artwork is quite good considering it was made by two people - one writer and one artist. (And a lot of the CGs are beautifully drawn)\n\nNegatives\n\n- Two of the CGs are a little wonky in the Gallery. The 7th Natsume image changes to a different one when scrolled over (though it does work when clicked on) and the image of the cat worked at first but now goes to the next image after it is clicked. Though I’m not sure if this is only with me or not.\n- I think I remember spotting some minor typos, though they were few and far between.\n\nFinal Verdict\n\n8/10 - A beautifully written story with complex and relatable characters and plenty of secrets to discover. And the demo contains 2 out of 5 chapters, which gives you plenty of time to see if you like it.","March 22","true","38.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Most visual novels cause you to feel like a bystander, but Break Chance Memento makes it seem like you have an active role. I actually started to emphathize and like nearly all of the characters.

Annoying dialogue, a mediocre half-♥♥♥♥♥ story and only two characters you can romance (who are by the way much less appealing than the main character's two brothers). What a waste of 20 dollars!\n\nThis visual novel suffers from what a lot of Western and English-translated visual novels are prone to; that is, pseudo-Japanese style dialogue. I understand why things are kept relatively close to their translation for visual novels that are originally Japanese, but is there any reason to choose to incorporate the Japanese style of speaking in a completely Western game? It just looks dumb. Real dumb. It bothered me throughout the whole game.\n\nAlso, there were soooo many instances where the main character found himself overhearing other characters speaking to themselves about conveniently crucial things. Nobody speaks to themselves out loud that much nor in such detail. It's so stupid! Those were my main issues with the dialogue in the game. The plot is a different story.\n\nTime travel as a plot device is extremely tricky, it has to be done just right or else the plot ends up being too convoluted to believe or follow. This was the case with Break Chance Memento. There was just too much going on for any of it to really matter; just one big cluster♥♥♥♥. The only death that really mattered was the first, because it was such a shock and so unexpected. But once you realize you can circumvent any bad situation that arises, the rest of plot complications are just meh.\n\nThe relationship with your brothers is pretty touching but you can't even romance either of them so who cares. The two non-brotherly routes were two missable characters with unappealing personalities and designs. I kind of wish the main character's brothers were like, step-brothers or something so you could actually romance them. I feel pretty jipped.","April 17","false","5.1"," 1 of 9 people (11%) found this review helpful","11","1","9","0","0"

To an extreme extent.\n- Seemingly open world is limited in exploration\n\nIf you love characterization and familial relationships, this game will tug on your heartstrings. The characters stay with you long after your last playthrough, and the different endings and missing mementos provide additional playtime.  Yukinari, in particular, stood out to me because he's unexpected in the every way, and it's refreshing. Although the price is a little steep, if you enjoy the visual novel medium, this game is definitely worth the investment. Don't be squicky about the gay romance part of the game, either - the story focuses more on rebuilding broken relationships and coping with tragedy.\n\nFour out of five stars.","June 3","true","13.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
