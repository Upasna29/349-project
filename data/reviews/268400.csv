This is basically a direct copy-update of the game.\n\nWhat you REALLY want though, is the Grand Campaign. That alone is worth the full price twice over, it's literally what it says on the tin. A grand campaign from 39-45 and it is much better paced than the stand alone game. It's also very good at representing what went on in the war and provides a nice learning curve. You'll stomp through Poland with ease, bounce up through Norway, smash the French as if they weren't there (after some minor resistance from the Belgians) and you'll feel epic as a General after having all those conquests. More so when you raid the Balkans.\n\nThen you go off against Russia, and it's easy, you smash them, underequipped, out of supply, un prepared. And you're laughing, over your German beer and with your fraulein sitting in your lap, you're one of the best army generals in the Nazi Regime.\n\nThen reality hits. The Russians mobilise, they get their airforce at you, their tanks roll towards you and the legions and legions of infantry just won't stop. Your puny Panzers' shells can't even stand up to their tanks, your anti-tanks get steamrolled, and its here, right on the battlefield in mother Russia that you'll find out whether your skills as a General are up to scratch. By the end of it, Poland and France will seem like a distant memory.\n\nReckon you're up to the challenge? Prove it! This game will push you to the limit.","September 25, 2014","true","470.8"," 187 of 197 people (95%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","95","187","197","8","0"

This game has great ratings, so you can read many other reviews on why PC is a good game. It does many things right - a neat branching scenario structure, solid foundation and some good voice overs to introduce the scenarios. For me, thats not enough and thus I'm going to explain why I don't think it's good enough to get a thumbs up.\n\nSimply put, PC is a remake of the old Panzer General games. And after playing this for 20 hours and playing those, I still think they're better games for one main reason: the Panzer Corps scenarios are usually very flawed.\n\nPanzer Corps makes the mistake of having too many units on too small of a map. There is little to no room for manuever. Thus the game is more puzzle-based than it is tactical. It's just a matter of figuring out that at "x" chokepoint I need 3 infantry, 1 arty and a tank to bust through. Once I know that, it's a matter of going to the next chokepoint. The time frames are always very tight, which rewards perfect unit usage and not necessarily good tactics. Seriously, whether you win or lose in any given map is often decided by your first half dozen combat results - if they're very favorable you're golden. If not, you're probably totally screwed.\n\nThere are two types of battles - you're on the offense and you're on the defense. If you're on the offense, the AI is going to just sit back and let you come to them. There's no ebb and flow here - it's all a matter of finding the "right" way to knock down yet another brick wall. After playing a number of these scenarios, I felt like the Allies trying to fight through the German hedgerows - frustratingly slow, brute-force combat tactics because you can't manuever. It gets old, fast.\n\nIf you're on defense, you can expect overwhelming odds since the AI isn't as effective as a human. So those scenarios are gamed up to present a challenge in numbers since the AI can't do it otherwise. They were, in a nutshell, disappointing.\n\nThere are other issues as well. I find the map to be muddled and not attractive. It's a wargame, I know, and it doesn't need to be beautiful. But I'd personally rather have counters than the muddled color scheme presented here. The branching campaign is pretty neat but has some real issues - for instance, if do well enough as Germany and you're going to presented with an almost unwinable scenario in the USA. Do slightly worse and delay the US invasion by two years and you'll have a far more winnable scenario. That's just bad design. Sea power has almost no part in the game as well, so it's all ground and air combat. Combined arms need not apply in most scenarios.\n\nBut it all goes back to scenario design - too many units, too small maps, no manuever and thus no imagination. I found them constricting. So why would I advocate paying for Panzer Corps (and don't get me started on the absurd DLC prices) when the old Panzer General II does it better? I can't. I'd rather play PG than PC and therefore PC gets the thumbs down. For those who are interested in the genre, I recommend Order of Battle: Pacific. It's a very similar game with larger maps, more fluid combat, combined arms and the maps aren't as muddled. To me it's a far superior game and easily worth the price difference.","December 6, 2015","false","21.4"," 234 of 274 people (85%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","85","234","274","5","5"

It was the first time I enjoyed a wargame on a computer, while my first grognard experience happened some ten years before when I was "inducted" through Avalon Hill's Third Reich boardgame. So, yes, I like my wargames.\n\nSince this is a videoGAME review, I will try and wear the gamer's hat, rather than the hardcore grognard's helmet.\n\nThis review is based on a playthrough of the Grand Campaign, Afrika Corps and Allied Corps, so all the "DLCs", the full enchilada.\n\nPros:\n- While the replayability is quite low, if it takes 650 hours to play through: even at full price, the cost opportunity is pretty good like 10 cents an hour.\n- Each scenario is different and there's never a dull moment.\n- The game is easy to learn and quite hard to master.\n- The number of units (and the very different way to employ each and every one of them) as well as the historical research to build the scenarios is quite impressive.\n- The game is virtually bug free. This should be a given, but it's worth mentioning considering the amount of junk that is unleashed on customers these days (Football Manager 2014, Rome Total War 2, and so forth).\n- It runs smoothly on pretty much every rig / OS / graphic card.\n- Far from being flashy, the graphics do their job.\n- The addition of heros makes the experience more personal.\n- The heavily scripted AI does its job at keeping you challenged.\n\nCons:\n- Increasing difficulty beyond General level, rather than giving you more challenges, just increases the number of enemies  / or their equipment quality (to very ahistorical levels).\n- The basic game feels like a demo compared to the Grand Campaign. definitely get all the DLCs.\n- The hero traits are too random (ok, this is the grognard talking, but, seriously, Artillery units with "spotting" traits and Air units with "movement" benefits are really useless / non-sensical).\n\nSo, whether you are a gamer with a casual interest in World War 2 tactics or a tough wargamer who looks for something more relaxing, this game is damn near perfect.","August 24, 2014","true","976.9"," 85 of 93 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","85","93","0","2"

At the same time however, the hours spent (not only on this but other wargames as well) trying to beat the campaign on Field Marshal, testing my skills with people on multiplayer, exploring the game on many levels, do grant me a well thought out opinion of this game, I hope :P\n\nOn with a brief presentation of the game!\nPanzer Corps Wehrmacht (PC) is a light, turn based (Igo-Ugo) strategy game and a reimplementation of the old school Panzer General (PG). If you liked PG you'll almost definitely enjoy PC and the opposite of course. The idea is simple. You start the second world war commanding part of the German army, starting from the invasion of Poland and decide its fate with possibilities ranging, depending on your performance, from its historical demise to a *minor spoiler* glorious blitzkrieg through the entire US.\n\nThe fun of the game derives through its tactical simplicity though it leaves a lot of room for depth—for those willing to look for it.\nAll you have to do is move and fire your units in any order you desire. Simple enough, huh?\nSure, but in order to master the game, you have to grasp many subtle mechanisms. Panzer Corps features: a variety of terrain with unique characteristics, unit suppression, an interesting initiative system, unit retreat/surrender, a weather system, supply (albeit in an unrealistic form due to the lack of supply lines), entrenchment, zone of control, strategic redeployment and many more interesting elements.\n\nFurthermore the game comes with many units that, besides chrome, offer many tactical opportunities. Will you plow the battlefield with slow moving King Tigers or blitz with Panther tanks? Will you dominate the skies with a combined fighters/dive bombers force or follow a fighter-bomber doctrine? Due to the many different unit types offered, the efficiency of combined arms really shines.\n\nAnother aspect of Panzer Corps is its subtle yet engaging strategic element.\nYou are given command of a core force that you control through the entire game, in contrast to a couple of secondary/temporary units that are provided for a single scenario. This core force can be expanded by buying/upgrading units between or during the scenarios but, friendly note, don't try to figure the scale; units may represent divisions, corps, or even armies, depending on the scope of the scenario. In addition, every unit gains experience through combat and the dilemma of how to replace loses, through regular (inexperienced and cheap) or elite (battle-hardened and expensive) replacements, arises. This of course means I have to explain prestige as well...\n\nPrestige (the game currency) depends on your performance on the scenario. That is the capture of objectives (primary/secondary) and the battle outcome (normal/decisive victory or defeat). A decisive victory may have to come many times through attrition which may cost in the long-run. Even more choices!\n\nHowever not everything's great...\nTo begin with, the A.I. is relatively uninspired. It doesn't act terribly ahistorically or plain silly (besides two rare situations) but the difficulty of most scenarios comes through the numerical advantage of the enemy. Then we have the repetitive objectives, at least in Wehrmacht, "Capture all cities in X turns". A few people nag about the lack of replay value as well but I beg to differ. Besides the branching campaign and the multiplayer scenarios (can be played both online and hotseat) there are a lot mods at your disposal for free!\n\nAnother thing that bugged me is the fact that, although there is an option of a detailed battle sheet both before and after each combat, the game lacks detail both in the tutorial and the manual. This leaves those eager to dig deeper no option other than to go through many forum posts. For example artillery has a rate of fire stat that isn't mentioned anywhere in the game! Every basic piece of information is covered however and the interface, in most cases, is intuitive and elegant.\n\nFinally, the realism issue arises. Due to its abstract nature this game is far from a simulation at a strategic level. The lack of many important details make it unrealistic at a tactical level as well. At its heart however every decision the player makes is realistic, in a sense that the same dilemmas arose to WW2 generals as well. Somehow, through the careful deduction from realism, this game manages to remain true, as much as a light wargame can, to the nature of the war.\n\nAll in all, Panzer Corps is a strategy game I would recommend to everyone; both the uninitiated who wants to discover the joys of wargaming and the grognard who wishes for a less complex game.\n\nRating: 9/10","September 18, 2015","true","469.1"," 68 of 73 people (93%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","93","68","73","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/strategikal/recommended/268400/","strategikal","Strategikal","http://steamcommunity.com/id/strategikal/","1935 products in account","Panzer Corps is a modern version of Panzer General, and I have to say that it's been improved in every way. Although it's new to Steam it was originally released back in 2011 and I've been playing it for over two years, so don't let my Steam game time fool you.\n\nGAME MECHANICS\n\nOne of the best things about this game is that it uses what I think of as "chess-like" or "rock/paper/stone" mechanics. While there are many hundreds of different units in the game, they're all grouped into specific types (infantry/tank/recon etc.). There are 9 different types of land and air units, each of which has distinct characteristics (just as different chess pieces move differently). Using those characteristics to their best advantage is key to success in the game, especially in combination with other units.\n\nFor example, infantry are best for attacking a city, but the city may be defended by an artillery unit behind it which gets a free attack against the infantry. So you could send a tank around the city to take out the artillery, but it's protected by an anti-tank gun. So then you send a tactical bomber in to bomb the artillery, but guess what, it's protected by an anti-aircraft gun! A successful assault against a city therefore, can often be a "chess-like" puzzle to solve. It's not just the strength of the units that counts, but the type of unit. Combined arms warfare is a must.\n\nGRAPHICS\n\nAlthough it still uses the classic 2D interface, the unit models are now displayed with a semi-3D look rather than side-on as in the original. They're higher res and detailed enough to make the many different unit types easily recognisable. The map graphics are still pretty basic compared to modern games but are a lot more detailed and pleasing to the eye than the very plain original. There are now two levels of zoom as well as the strategic map.\n\nSCALE\n\nThe game is operational in scale, rather than tactical (individual battles) or strategic (whole war), and the actual scale is variable depending on what's being represented. So a scenario may cover the invasion of the whole of Norway, or just the island of Malta. In spite of the big difference, it works well. Tanks and infantry have to be adjacent to attack, while artillery can typically fire 2 to 3 hexes. Planes have a large movement area and need to be refuelled so can't stay in the air indefinitely.\n\nSCENARIOS\n\nThe 26 scenarios cover the main battles throughout the course of World War Two in Europe. They can be played standalone as either side or as a complete campaign from the German perspective, allowing your core force to gain experience and upgrade throughout the war.\n\nThe scenarios themselves cover mostly the same battles as in the original Panzer General but they've been redesigned, often at a different scale, so the maps are not identical.\n\nUNITS\n\nThere are many more unit types available in this version, including some very rare units not often seen in WWII games, giving considerably more tactical diversity. The AI has also been improved. New terrain types have been added, for example railways, which allow quick transportation between cities once you control them, which adds an interesting extra dimension to the transportation possibilities.\n\nCOMBAT CHANGES\n\nThe combat mechanics are basically the same as the original, but have been tweaked to be more user-friendly. For example, whereas a unit had to both move and fire before selecting another unit, now movement and firing can be done at different times during the turn. For example, previously if you moved a unit then selected another unit before firing the first one, it would lose the ability to fire. Now it doesn't, so you can move unit 1, then move unit 2, then attack with unit 1. This gives you a lot more flexibility in how you organise your combined attacks.\n\nAlso, artillery can now be fired after moving. Perhaps not so realistic, but a lot easier to manage. Previously, when advancing, the artillery was always playing catch-up and often took a long time to get into position before you could actually use it. Now, you can move a melee unit forward, advance an artillery unit into the hex it just vacated, fire with the artillery, then attack with the melee unit once the defenders have been suppressed. Much more convenient! Additionally, many artillery units now have a longer range, 3 hexes instead of 2, making it even more useful.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nAs a long time wargamer (starting with Panzer Blitz in 1979), I'd have to say that this is possibly the best ALL-ROUND wargame I've ever played. It's a lot more polished and bug free than most other turn based wargames, it has enough depth and strategy to satisfy experienced wargamers, yet it's still accessible enough for newbies to the genre to enjoy, which is quite a brilliant balancing act.\n\nIt's definitely not a grognard's game, it doesn't contain complex spreadsheets and have hundreds of units to move every turn, but that's a good thing IMO. I've played overly complex strategy games in the past and quite frankly, the depth of detail can become tedious and take much of the fun out of the game. This game has relatively small numbers of units in each scenario and is quick to play. It has a very high fun factor that more serious games lack, whilst still containing plenty of strategic depth and a lot of detail and accuracy for the history buffs.\n\nCIV V SIMILARITY\n\nIt's been admitted by Firaxis that the new combat system in Civilization V was partly based on Panzer General. Therefore all those Civ 5 fans who enjoy the new 1 unit per hex combat system would probably find this game very appealing, since there are a lot of similarities there. The big difference is that Firaxis over-simplified the combat system, whereas in Panzer Corps it's more detailed and realistic (and thus more enjoyable if you're purely in the mood for combat rather than developing an entire civilisation).\n\nVERDICT\n\nI highly recommended this game for all turn based strategy fans, especially those interested in historical recreations of actual battles in World War II.","March 12, 2014","true","59.5"," 111 of 144 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","111","144","0","6"

You know, one of those old strategy games from the 90's! It's actually an attempt to recreate Panzer General, which is a strategy game loved by many. By ME, anyway! If you don't know what Panzer General is, it's a virtual board game with hidden dice rolls, pretty basic audio and very minimal animation.\n\nSome of you might be turned off by the sound of that, but I think that this game incredibly immersive. I get frustrated when my enemy scores a rugged defense that thwarts my planned attack! I am fillled with joy when one of my units decimates the enemy and a hero emerges. I'm quite confident in saying that when you lose one of your units either due to a bad roll or just poor judgement, you will consider loading an older save to try and keep them alive.\n\nSome mechanics of the game:Each mission begins with specific set of auxilliary units. Auxiliary units are specifically set for only that mission so you won't have control of after them after the mission is finished. You could use them for dangerous situations because there's no real consequence for losing them. I wouldn't suggest just throwing them away, but sometimes that's what they are there for. Auxiliary units are represented by a grey color around the strength box. You are given "Prestige" at the start of each mission which is the currency of the game, used to buy your core units and reinforcing units (you also gain prestige by defeating enemies and capturing strategic points). Core units are what you will have throughout the campaign so take good care of them! They have a golden ring around the strength box.\n\nCore units will perform better than auxiliary units in almost all occasions due to having higher experience which gives your units bonuses. Throughout the campaign new units will be unlocked and it's a good idea to upgrade your units. Upgrading your old Panzer II's up to Panzer III's for example. Your units gain experience through combat, medals through participation or deeds, and like I mentioned before, heroes through excellence. When you reinforce a damaged unit you can either use fresh recruits which are cheap but it reduces the experience of the unit as a whole, or veteran replacements which cost significantly more, but alow you to keep your current experience value.\n\nYour units are represented by an icon and a strength number. The strength number represents the number of men available in the unit who can fight (it isn't literally 10 men or tanks, it's just a representation on a scale of 1 to 10+). Over time, through combat, your units can gain experience and levels. When they gain a level they can be reinforced to be an 'over strength' value. Over strength meaning that they can be brought up to 11, 12 or even 13 strength value. They will perform better of course, but the trade off is that it costs substantially more to reinforce the unit above 10.\n\nYour units have more detailed statistics which range from:\n\nAttack values against soft (infantry, some artillery, trucks, etc), hard targets (tanks, half-tracks, bunkers, etc), air targets (.. planes, planes, etc) and naval attack (against ships der)\n\nDefense values for ground or air attacks and also what type of defense your unit uses (soft, hard, air or naval).\n\nView range (how many hexes they can reveal)\n\nMovement distance and what type of movement they use. Certain movement types travel over certain terrain types more easily than others. There is tracked, wheeled and good ol' fashion 'Leg'!.\n\nClose Defense is how well the unit defends itself in urban or forest areas or when they are ambushed.\n\nFinally, 'Range' is how far the unit can attack from. Your standard infantry or tank unit can only attack enemies next to them. Artillery on the other hand can attack from a distance usually 2 to 3 hexes away.\n\nUnits also have an ammo count and if applicable a fuel count which both need to be resupplied after a while. Ammo is  how many attacks or defensive shots you can make before needing to use a turn to be resupplied (a unit without ammo cannot return fire which is something you can exploit!). Fuel is fairly self explaining, a unit uses 1 fuel for every hex it travels. Resupplying restores both ammo and fuel, so it's got that going for it..\n\nTLDR; The game, while it may look fairly simple by it's screenshots or videos, has a lot of complexity to it for you to use to your advantage and I find it highly rewarding.\n\n\n\nSomething about the campaigns:\nYou start out with having tutorials teaching you the basics (you'll have to come up with your own strategies and tactics to get decisive victories!). Then you move into the campaigns. You can choose from 4 with the base game which determine the time you want to start the war at and the battles you'll take part in. Some of the missions overlap in the campaigns but it depends on your choices and victories / losses.\n\nSomeone made a neat chart that tells you which missions are in each campaign: http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/3318332566192367118/183E683584A5430315E3D95789E1D0CE1F7DE724/\n\nAs you can see on that chart, the base game has in total 40 different missions. Add to that that you can change your core army around which can make the same mission play very differently and you have yourself a lot of replayability! Want an army heavy with panzers and mechanized infantry to flank and destroy enemies from behind? Or how about one focusing on a large number of pioneers and artillery to break through ANY defense? The choice is yours and there are a lot of choices.\n\nThe game follows history to a certain degree, like when the war began and certain historical battle dates, but you can drastically alter history. For example: you can go as far as conquering the United States after conquering Russia.\n\nI'd say that the 'Grand Campaign' DLC's are the way to play this. The base game is great, but it's sort of a 'lite' version. The GC goes into further detail with the stages of the war. Instead of 4 missions conquering Poland it's 10 or so (14 all together but there are branching choices and situations) but this is straying into a review for the DLC now.\n\n\n[h1TLDR again?;[/h1] This game can be simple yet complex. Bland yet immersive. Yet, yet yet! Honestly, I think it's worth well over $20. It goes on sale once in a while so if you're on the fence just wait for one of those. This is definitely a game no strategy fan should miss.\n\nI apologize for this poorly structured novela of a review. This is my first real 'review'  and any feedback or discussion is greatly appreciated. Want me to never write again? I'll see what I can do! Thanks for checking it out!","February 11","true","31.8"," 26 of 27 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","26","27","0","1"

If you're looking for graphics and flashy animations, look elsewhere. This is old school "Just one more turn as the hours go by quickly" gameplay. It's pretty basic, but quite strategic. Move all your units during your turn, then the computer does the same. The great thing about this game is that you can customize your army as you see fit. If you like a massive airforce with a few tanks to use blitzkrieg tactics...do it! Do you like to use artillery to soften up city defenses before sending in the troops...it's there. some strategies work better than others, but no matter how you play it....IT'S FUN....and so addictive.  Change history...invade England...invade the USA...if you're good enough. Spending your prestige points after battles is like opening presents at Christmas. Pay no attention to my hours on this game...I purchased it a long time ago from the original producers and have over 1500 hours logged in. Purchased every expansion and to this day I still play it weekly...my most played game ever.  One of the things I really like is that periodically a unit will get a bonus modifier applied to it as a reward (+3 Attack, +1 defense, +1 spotting, etc.) These modifiers actually make the unit noticeably better so it truly feels like a reward. As units gain experience in scenarios, you can also overpower them making stronger as the war progresses and when new technology arrives you can even upgrade them! I personally like the campaign modes and I like to try and rewrite history. Difficulty is adjustable as well as prestige points which allows you to upgrade and purchase new units. You can set it to be hard as hell or make it so easy that you just annihilate the enemy. Love the navy units as well! If you ever played Panzer General II and liked it, you'll feel right at home here.

Very good graphics and simple input makes a user friendly game which anyone can master in no time - a real jump right into game.  This allows for you to fight a scenario or campaign and learn the little things which make it a great game as you learn the system.  The use of core and non-core units with experience gained for combat makes a player utilize his forces differently - thus modifing scenario play once again increasing replayability. I have the most time ever invested in this game 3000hrs of Steam time and at least another 2000hrs before Steam added the game and time became tracked!  I have left the game alone for a month or two then keep coming back - once again because no other WW2 game offers so much satisfaction, simplicity, and great multiplayer.  Plus - for the price no better value!!  The developers did not stop with the game but supported it with DLC's and several other versions - Allied & Africa Corp adding even more challenges!!\nI am disappointed in one thing - muliplayer does not give the option of tracking wins and loses.

Panzer Corps is a nice clone, but there are several drawbacks from the original.  Graphics wise there have been SOME improvements but some nice features of the original PG were left out.  Such as cut video scenes from WW2 and also during gameplay there are no battle boxes in the corners of your screen showing your troops fighting.  Minor details that might not be important to some but I think add a lot to the experience.  The objectives in Panzer Corps also are really difficult to acheive if you play with the fog of war on and anything above easy difficulty, which is really unfortunate.  In the original PG you had enough moves to achieve your objectives and have a decent shot of getting major/decisive victories, but not so in Panzer Corps.  I'm not sure what the developers were thinking as most maps you have between 10 and 13 moves to capture all objectives (for decisive victory) which on most maps is impossible.  Lastly, as a lot of reviewers have noted the game has only a fraction of the scenarios the original PG had, so you have to buy all the stupid DLC's to get the full package, which is a TOTAL ripoff.  My advice is to try and find a copy of the original PG for free and play that.  However you might like Panzer Corps for brief nostalgia.","August 9, 2015","false","60.2"," 48 of 74 people (65%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","65","48","74","5","0"

I am at Operation Sea Lion 40' after demolishing Poland, Belgium, and France in decisive victories. Its a great game for many other reasons. One being that it has the minor countries in it as well as the large ones. Romania, Bulgaria, Canada, Hungary, Belgium, and others. The only one it doesnt have is Finland but in the Soviet Corps that is coming out soon I saw it in there. I love this game so much now.

You can get more for your money on steam. Save your money and buy CIV5, Unity of Command or TW instead if you are into turn-based strategy games.\n\nAs a fan of the classic Panzer General, I bought this game three years ago. It comes with just 26 scenarios, some of which are nearly identical. If you play a campaign, you won't come across all of them. I finished the campaign in less than 10 hours and I'm sure there are players who play faster than I. It's clear that Matrix wants you to buy its overpriced dlcs. In the end, you would end up spending 80 bucks on a game which is nothing more than a blatant clone of the classic Panzer General. It appears that because the original PG creator company SSI does not exist anymore they can do it without facing copyright infringement claims.\nIf you are not used to the old Panzer General this game might be boring and dull to you. The graphics cannot compete with newer titles, the gameplay does not offer a lot of depth. All you have to do is drag your units from A to B. Even if you're fan of the original hit Panzer General, you should not touch it. There are several free ports and countless campaigns available for free.","April 7, 2014","false","3.2"," 118 of 205 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","118","205","0","17"

And it was a thoroughly enjoyable experience.\nThis is first and foremost a “game” rather than a “simulation”, yet the game has plenty of historical chrome and details. It is really easy to get into the game even if you are not familiar with WW2 tactics. However there is plenty of room to showcase your skills whether tactical or for managing your corps. For those reasons I'm glad to see this game coming to Steam and a wider audience.\n\nPros:\n- Simple 2D game engine with neat gfx and convincing sound fx, that efficiently support gameplay. Multitask easily, no crash in 300 games! However I had a few problems on MP while uploading or replaying turns, it might be due to poor connection or security programms.\n- Easy controls and clean UI, short loading times.\n- The game was already good on release in 2011, but the developers made a number of improvements and refinements which make it even better today. Plus Steam achievements.\n- The strongest game asset is probably the campaign game, where you develop your Corps scenario after scenario, your units gaining experience and heroes, you can also upgrade units with new equipments as the war progresses. Building you very own Corps, not only adds a layer of meta strategy over the individual scenarios, but it also awake the RPG fan in you.\n- Plenty of scenarios with the DLCs.\n- Over 800 unit types database, and easily modable, which is great for scenarios designers.\n\nCons:\n- I wished the AI was better not necessarily in sheer strength but in adapting its behaviors to the various situations. It is not a problem when you discover the game, but with practice you'll note that the AI repeatedly uses the same pattern, and it is not so good at using combined arms.\n- Basically scenarios outcome are: defeat, minor victory, major victory. I would have liked either finer grained, or better calibrated, victory conditions. As it is, it is too easy too achieve a major victory on most scenarios.\n- Same for the difficulty levels. With 5 difficulty levels there should be something for everyone, however even the hardest level is relatively easy for experienced players. Nevertheless with the latest releases, there is now an “advanced settings” panel which allows to increase the difficulty to suit your skills.\n- The scenarios of the original game are OK, but those of the DLCs are better, in particular the scale of the battles depicted works better with the game mechanisms.\n- If you are looking for historical accuracy, you might get hurt.\n- Most MP scenarios feels too much like a RTS rather than WW2 battles.\n- Despite being very good on release, 4 years later the development is rather disapointing, the devs merely added more scenarios, they never cared to improve balance (especially in MP) or to add some gameplay elements (Actually most gameplay community requests were implemented in Order Of Battle: Pacific).\n\nOverall I rate the game 85/100. I think it could easily appeals to strategy fans even if they are new to WW2 gaming, or to the grognards looking for a lighter yet very thematic recreation.\nRecommended.\n\nPS: note that the base Panzer Corps game at 19,99€ is a fully featured self contained game, the numerous DLCs only add more campaigns. It is not like , say Civ V, where DLCs add significant game play elements you wouldn't want to play the game without.\n\nI think it would take over 100 hours to complete all campaigns and scenarios of the base game once. And you'll probably want to play them several time to try new strategy. Plus many free quality mods already available.\n\nCheap maybe not, but very good value for money.","March 12, 2014","true","282.4"," 46 of 75 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","46","75","0","0"

The game's main feature is the dynamic campaign, each scenario has specific parametres to achieve "decisive victory" these are like "S" ranking a mission in other games and it is actually quite hard to achieve a decisive victory even in the early levels.  I often found myself getting a decisive victory on the last turn.  If you win through any other means it is a mere "marginal victory" and this is where the game gets really interesting.  A marginal victory is cause history to play out normally, but a decisive victory will lead into scenarios like Operation Sea Lion.  Furthermore, your core units (as long as they survive) will persist between scenarios in the campaign, they can also gain medals and have heroes added to them depending on their performance.

Simply put, it is an equal or better to the old Panzer General games. So many indie games have tried to copy Panzer General, a seemingly simple task, and failed. Unit experience, branching campaigns, over strength units, huge numbers of individual vehicles and infantry types, and a simple and clean interface. This one ships with small campaigns and a full grand campaign that branches in alt-history directions, but once you play that you will want to start picking up the add-on packs, which imho are worth the price of admission. Just buy them as you play them or wait for a big sale. My advice, after you've played through the main game, pick up the Afrika Korps campaign. It's long, with more alt history twists and turns if you succeed at your objectives.\n\nI have spent a lot of good money on lame pretenders to the PG throne on Steam over the years.

Its roots reach all the way into the 70's and AH's entry into the wargaming world, and has preserved all that is good and playable in a turn-based WWII game. The Best. Ever.\nThe DLCs work flawlessly, and each one adds significant depth to the games and dozens of hours of enjoyment. The 128 hours I've played so far are just on Steam; I've owned this game since it was first announced, and I've owned all the games it is based upon, all the way back to AH's Blitzkreig.\nI really can't say a single bad word about this game, as for me it is perfection (well, if it made breakfast that'd be great too.) It is not for the FPS guys or the RTS guys; however, if you can slow down and learn to enjoy a games depth and thoughtfulness and comprehensive presentations of conventional warfare in the 20th century, you will learn to love this game series.\nThe controls are elegant, the options are varied and make for an excellent adjustment to give you just the gaming experience you desire. The entire game can be played with just your mouse, although you can set and modify many keymaps. The game contains a wealth of historical and technical data and will allow the user to satifactorily recreate any time periond, battle sequence, or campaign from this massively important time in human history. The map has two levels of zoom and a strategic view as well, easily shifted between ground and air units, which is all the divisions you need to play this game seamlessly. This can be a casual, quick scenario game, or a deep and long-lsting campaign with units developing heroes, increased combat strengths, and upgrades. Most all military units are represented, easily identifiable, and movement and combat are simple click/click movements. It has a nice musical background and great yet simple audio battle sounds. You can save at any time, you can review a battlefield after conclusion, and it has more than adequate support for most all resolutions. It is not a computer hog for resources, and can run on older or less robust systems than most games.\nI've never really had a technical issue, other than it getting a little sloggy after playing for 8 hours or so, and a simple save/restart cleared that up. With the release of the Soviet campaigns/scenarios, I can't wait to experience them from the Russian perspective; I will add to the review when I've played it a lot.\nIn case you glossed over it, this is the BEST turn-based WAR GAME EVER. Replayability is infinite, as is the enjoyment. It is not for every single person on the planet, but only for the intelligent, patient players who enjoy a brilliant design and a flawless execution of an elegantly simple, yet deep combat system. Forget to combine your arms in the proper order, and an easy victory will turn on it and defeat you. It can be played solo, hot-seat (both players in the room but each player only sits at the PC when it's their turn, or multiplayer and PBEM.\n\nPERFECT.

That has been the BEST part of the experience. After we ran out of multiplayer scenarios after about 4 years or something, we began downloading custom scenarios.

It is not difficult to learn and if you ever played Panzer General you probably don't even need to read the manual.  It falls into the beer and pretzels style of wargame.  My only real complaint is that you have to buy a lot of DLC to complete the game.  However that gives you hundreds of scenarios if you do.  You do not have to worry about things like supply lines, only what you are going up against and replenishing your ammo and fuel.  Weather is a big factor in success and so it the time limit.\n\nIt is an excellent game if you like WWII style top down play - if you prefer more complex wargames such as Hearts of Iron (  I was totally bored by HOI III )   this is not for you .","September 24, 2014","true","142.0"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/schutzenbauer/recommended/268400/","schutzenbauer","-=Schutzenbauer=-","http://steamcommunity.com/id/schutzenbauer/","2136 products in account","Cons:\n- EXPENSIVE ($80 for a collection !!!)\n- Repetetive (click, point, click, point, click, point, etc).\n- While overall the graphics are fine, some aspects remain problematic.  Trees are extremely tiny, look like bushes on the map, forests or trees adjasent to forests extend over tiles which are classified as fields making strategic planning often burdensome\n- Simplistic.  Units health = 10, what does this mean?, why not show actual numbers of soldiers, equipment?  Supply map is not well explained/shown/integrated/conceptualized by the player, while supply is very important in grand strategy games in Panzer Corp you can be encircled over a wide area and still be fully supplied, how is that possible? Simply run on the map to the marked points (usually cities), knocking out enemy units on the way without worrying much about supplies, partisants or any other side-aspects of a typical 20th century warfare.  Very limited focus on units morale (all units generally have high morale, I guess German morale in Russia in the 1940s was generally good <-- NO IT WASNT, look at historic photographs and battle statistics)\n- No understanding what the units actually represent leads me to form a very poor bond with my\nunits.  Are these units divisions, armies?  What are these formations? (for exmaple, AT gun unit, does this mean its several platoons with AT guns?, but then how can this be when the map streches over 100s of kilometers and there are only about 60 units on the map).  When a unit reaches 0/10 its destroyed (kind of an arcade time count)\n- No battle/war statistics displayed at the end of each campaign/war (this is a historic grand strategy game so tables, graphs, performance charts is a MUST HAVE! )\n\nPros:\n- Decent selection of equipment from the era.\n- Decent graphics with well visible/recognizable unit icons\n- Awards to particular units for bravery or other special achievements\n- Simple click, point and click strategy game on a hex-based board layout (this might be a drawback for some, see below)\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\nMore about the problems:\nThe collection is EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE, the game is basically the old Panzer General series, its a simple hex-based board game, with slightly better (its a 2D graphics so you shouldnt expect much in the graphics department), maybe a few new units and mostly just new maps.  I mean COMMON $80 for dozens of new 2D maps for $80, REALLY?  Skyrim with its excellent 3D graphics and a much more complex engine was not even as expensive as Panzer Corps Collection is now.  Yes the developers state that this is a BRILLIANT REMAKE or some crap like that on their website, however they dont justify that argument with neither specific explanations about why its presumably so much better than the old, nor have I experiance anything new playing this game.  Considering that you can get Panzer General 2 for several dollars online and there hundreds (if not thousands) of FREE maps/campaigns made over the last 20 years or so which can be downloaded online, the games price is simply out of norm at the moment.  Also, some aspects of the older games were actually better than in this most recent one.  For example, I actually preferred the terrain in Panzer General 2 over this game (e.g., vegetation type, such as tree cover, was far more pleasent and recognizable in the old one).  Automatic switching between ground units and air units (e.g., when you move an air unit to attack a ground unit) is very clumsy and in some cases does and sometmes it does not result in an attack (you have to execute the command once more after you place the air unit of ground unit to attack).  There are other problems with the game, but these do not neccessarly reflect a sole problem of Panzer Corps but rather a general design flaw with hex-based war games (e.g., AT guns = if these are inf units equiped with AT guns, why are they weaker than regular inf units which lack AT guns?).\n\nPublishers Censorship:\nAside from the game itself, the developer has been known to block/censor people on steam forum who complain about aspects of the game, such as the extremely high cost of the game.  Basically someone posts a message stating that the game price is overblown, then some other users (potentialy someone who works for the developer as this has been repeated numerous times on steam forum) posts a comment criticising the original comment with some unpleasent remarks (not even swear words), then the original poster responds to it with more unpleasent remarks (again, no swear words) and then the publisher quickly blocks the post and bans the original person posting the comment criticising the high cost of the game PERMANENTLY stating that the person has made an unpleasent comment !  Simple corporate scheme to block critique against the buisness strategy of the company.","December 26, 2014","false","95.7"," 70 of 129 people (54%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","54","70","129","5","4"

I know, I know hexes are scary but don’t let that deter you too much. If you can put up with a little sparsity in its presentation Panzer Corps is an engaging and expansive strategy game.\n\nThe base campaign sees you taking control of the German army during WW2 and you will visit most of the fronts in the European war. The game also uses a semi dynamic campaign which will give you access to new missions depending on your performance.\n\nIt also features my favorite thing in strategy games, persistent units. througout the campaign your units will gain experience and perks that in the end can have a big effect on your units survivability. It almost goes without saying that your dead units will stay dead. A more personalized core force might have been even better but what is there is engaging and fun.\n\nIn the end Panzer Corps is fun and easy get started in and I reccommend it to anyone who likes a bit more challenge in their strategy games without going full Hearts of iron. The only thing I can really say against it is that it might be a tad over priced without a sale and that its simple presentation makes the ipad version more attractive than the PC.","December 2, 2015","true","57.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I love them. I am not an expert, but I am not bad at all.\n\nIt is extremely uncommon for me not to find any flaws in a game. There is always something wrong.\n\nI have been thinking about buying this for a long time, because I have bought some games before, and just after that I have lost my motivation to play them.\n\nBut now, after 11 hours of intensive playing I think, that this game is PERFECT. I am really amazed how everything has been thought out. UI is extremely useful, intuitive, and everything, what you would expect, is shown in the right place.\n\nAI is amazing. Many times, I just wanted to rush and moved my artillery (or support units) ahead into a theoretically safe area. And every time some AI units jumped in and slayed them like little kittens. AI behaves almost exactly like a human. It will exploit all your weaknesses. All of them. No regret, no remorse.\n\nI have skipped built in campaigns and have bought Grand Campaign '39. And, if you think, that conquering Poland is piece of cake, you are SO WRONG. 7 hours of playing and I have just came into the third scenario. Campaign is thought out very well. The map is not 100% accurate, but it does include all the terrain features that you would expect, type of units (lots of Polish infantry, but not a match for Wermacht, lots of AT guns, and great Polish cavalry), and strategic objectives of that time (ie. bridges in Northern Poland). It also features successful Polish counter offensive near Bzura river - in that scenario you really need to be careful with every move you make. I live in Gdansk, former Danzig, the place where IIWW broke out, so I know what I am talking about.\n\nTutorial is just great and very informative. It doesn't treat you like a child trying to learn you how to click with your mouse. It focuses on the most important stuff.\n\nIf I had the opportunity, I would come back in time and SLAP my past-me in the face. Just for thinking too much.\nWell, I don't have an access to a time machine, but don't do the same mistake... because the future-you could have...\n\nDo you remember, what I said at the beginning? It is extremely uncommon for me not to find any flaws in a game. This is the first time. Panzer Corps has no flaws at all.\n\nJust buy it.

If you like old Panzer General games you will probably also like Panzer Corps. If you never played Panzer General-kind of games bear in mind that it is not typical RTS style game. You will spend lot of time on planning each unit deployment and each unit move to eventually win the battle. Your main concern might be the price, but truth is that you really no need to by everything at once. If you get only base game, you will spend at least 50+ hours on higher difficulty in main campaign plus there is tons of free content. Later on you might consider to by DLC’s, which are also great, especially when they will be on sale.\n\nIf you into turn based strategy games with historic background this might be good choice.","August 22, 2015","true","191.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Looks and plays very like the old Panzer General from back in the day.\n\nI played through PanzerCorps on an iPad some time ago and now I've started replaying it on PC with all the DLC that was not available when I played on iPad. I mention that because, from what I've seen so far, its pretty much identical to the iPad version.\n\nGraphically its functional, but not pretty. Running at 1080p, the graphics look drab/blurry/grainy. Its like they took an old 640x480/800x600 screen and just upscaled it. The UI is messy and clunky. The boxes look the wrong size, menu icons look too small and theres a lot of 'wasted space' that could be used to display useful ingame information like terrain type/effects that aren't necessarily clear from the map. The 'clunky' feel applies to the whole thing, from save games to scernario editing. On the upside you get a lot of maps/scenarios for your money. At £35(ish) for the complete set, thats a good deal if you like 'basic, turnbased, hexmap WW2 wargames'.\n\nAs for the battles ...... the combat results seem to have a wide range, so predicting the outcome of a battle is always uncertain. You think your unit of 109s should be able to take out the unit of Stukas in the tutorial mission? You may be surprised and find you need all three of your 109 units - and they end up taking more casualties than the Stukas! And don't trust those computer generated combat result predictions, they are downright fantasy.\n\nThe AI seems to have some abilities you don't, so it happily reinforces its units in circumstances you couldn't, marches out of nowhere to attack your rear echelon units that it couldn't 'see' beforehand ..... etc.\n\nThe AI is neither stupid nor particularly competent - but its unique 'abilities', your limited unit choices, scenario time restrictions, combat result uncertainty .... etc .... usually make for a challenging game.\n\nAnyway, I bought it again! Partly for old times sake, partly because I like it despite its glaring flaws, partly because theres a lot of game for your money, partly because its so undemanding it runs on just about any old PC ...... and the hex based ww2 genre isn't exactly crowded.","April 24","true","8.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","6"

That was over 40 years ago and how things have changed... After progressing through the ZX Spectrum and Atari ST, I finally arrived at a 386DX and MS-DOS 5, a platform that was to develop into the best and most versatile gaming system the world has to offer.\n\nThere was Perfect General, Panzer General, History Line to name a few. I loved the simplicity of Panzer General 2 and Battle Isle 2 over the wargames with more complex rules, preferring to play than read rule books. Last year I discovered Panzer Corps and was amazed at how easy it was to pick up and play, it must be the most accesible wargame ever.\n\nI've now played through the base game, and went back and replayed it a couple a times to make sure I had a go at all of the scenarios. I read a few tips to sharpen my game and have worked out the whole combined arms thing. I've moved on to Africa Korps on my laptop but I'm replaying the original game on my desktop on Field Marshal diffculty (my first go was on Colonel). I've bought all the DLC up to and including Sea Lion as I know it's going to take me a long time to tire of it.\n\nFor the hard core wargamer who likes a thick book of rules and calling up off map artillery and air support, ensuring tanks are facing the right way and every realism nailed down, Panzer Corps might be too simplistic. But for a more casual wargamer who wants to flick through a thin rule book and do his learning on the battlefield, it's perfect. There's a great support community on the Slitherine website, and DLC keeps getting released. Highly recommended for those who want to play a solid wargame without having to go on a course first.","February 4","true","297.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You get to command a mostly persistent force through a number of historical and hypothetical WWII campaign scenarios that unravel depending on progress and success in prior battles. It's thanks to tactical depth, freedom and replayability as well as an unprecedented scale of campaigns found in both the base game and especially the numerous DLCs that Panzer Corps deserves in my mind the title of the best turn-and-hex based strategy game of 2014.\n\nAccessible for even those players completely unfamiliar with the genre conventions, it's a gem worth checking out even at the current steep price.

There are many (mostly visual) improvements and as many additional complications, but the game remains fundamentally the same-a somewhat simplified tactical wargame worthy of many classic board war games (thanks to TTG, WRG, SSI and their pioneering predecessors) and the original PG itself, born of those little cheap boxed map-and-counter games those of us old or keen enough to remember started with. I would recommend the basic game at the start-veterans may miss the irritating arbitrariness of the original (weather and supply reducing the game to a perfect and deeply aggravating historic re-enactment are still optional, thank goodness!), but I believe as a veteran tabletop wargamer of thirty years that you will still find the challenge inherent in the original game, but with some shiny extra features that may please you. I must add that I am currently ploughing through the original game, crrently on sale (24 Feb 2016) and as such I must also add that DLC is also available. However I have chosen to avoid the DLC for now until I am familiar with the main game, in order to ensure that I know what I am letting myself in for. Feel free to do as you like, but as an "old sweat" familiar with long drawn-out military campaigns fought from the safety of my own four walls, this will do and saves me hours of setting up a table and putting it all away afterwards.","February 24","true","42.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The victories are the only real differance as they can add little things like destory trains or lead these small country units threw the capital or save some cut off units behind enemy lines while still capturing or holding certain objectives. I do like this game with these added victory conditions. The dlc to the grand campaign do add alot more battles then the original panzer general game had. Even with expierenced and battle hardened units its not as easy to roll over all units like in PG. Which I also enjoy.\n\nCONS: To enjoy the full game you really need all the DLC. And to buy it at regular price it just isnt worth it for a 2D startegy game. The AI seems to be dumb sometimes. Units with entrenchment will move off cities to attack and for no real purpose other then a chance to weaken an advancing unit.

A dream becoming reality, as i have always been a PG fanatic and finally i no longer needed dosbox to play the best turn based strategy game every devised. The main game of Panzer Corps comes with a tutorial campaign (for new players) and a basic campaign, spanning WW2. Single scenarios can be played as well and not to forget, the possibility to play multiplayer games.\n\nAfrica Korps and Allied Corps are two great add-ons where in Africa Korps you can command and purchase a mixed force of Italian and German troops and where Alllied Corps offers the opportunity to start either as the Americans or the British. The British campaign of Allied Corps kicks off as a tutorial, in which difficulty augments slowly but it does feel good to kick the Italians big time in the butt, but when Rommel finaly arrives, you will need all your command abilities to outsmart the Desert Fox. For every campaign, you can make a lot of choices in terms of difficulty (very detailed), terms of game play and you can built and expand your army with a whole variety of units. You can even be rewarded an extra unit from time to time, SE units called, that do not count towards the number of units you can have in your army. Africa Korps and Allied Corps are guarantees for many hours of extra game play. It is not only while playing Civ 5 that a little voice says...one more turn please.... Hopefully your Africa Korps will march into Egypt :)\n\nThe Grand Campaign (the DLCs 39-40 and 41-45 East and 42-45 West) offer over a hundred new scenarios. Each year of the war is a campaign on its own, but oh so special, that when you finish for example DLC 39, you can carry over and import (by prompt) your army in DLC 40! You can also start any DLC of any given year, with the pre-placed army. You will experience Stalingrad as General Paulus or D-Day as FM Rommel.\n\nPanzer Corps which is now finally available on Steam, is not the same game as it appeared three years ago. It became twice as good by several patches, new content, and surely by the tremendous feedback by the Panzer Corps community. How many games are out there, where the community has a say in the development of a game?\nI gladly admit, I have never enjoyed a community as much as the Panzer Corps community and as such to be part of a great family and i made a lot of new friends in the process.\n\nSo, if you decide to buy the game on Steam, keep in mind that you reap the fruits of three years of game improvements!\n\nAnd in the meantime the PC community awaits with great anticipation, the next installment, namely, Soviet Corps!\n\nBy Nikivdd (Panzer Corps beta tester and modder).","March 12, 2014","true","717.5"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

Each unit has its' own advantages, strengths and weaknesses - a King Tiger is truely a powerful tank, but it cannot win the war alone! With the original prestige system the game forces you to adapt your strategy around the battlefield: if you're taking heavy losses, should I pull-back, give them green reinforcements, or veterans? As you push through the campaign, with a choice of five starting years, your core forces follow through, gaining experience, and eventually medals and heroes.\n\nThe flexibility of tactics allow your preferences to come out in your core and mission results. Choices such as those between ground attack and fighter-bomber aircraft: early in the game, you have the Ju87 Stuka and the Bf110. The Stuka is a more reliable source of damage, but more vulnerable to enemy interceptors and anti-air fire whilst the 110 can engage other aircraft, typically used to finish off shattered aircraft or mop up craft that cannot do much back like bombers, as well as faring better in air combat, but at the cost of less performance in ground strikes.\nAnti-tank, artillery, or anti-aircraft weapons on a tank chassis make for faster, more reliable defence and offense, but at a higher price and losing out on the bonuses crewed non vehicle weapons obtain - as they are not armoured, they fare better in close terrain and hold better ambush advantages, amongst other things. Sometimes a mix is better - keeping general support weapons with main attacks whilst giving mechanised AA, AT and artillery to tank groups to better support their attacks can benefit both. But now you're dividing your forces into two distinct groups and you have to weigh up whether the advantages are enough!\n\nA range of scenarios are present in the game: relive the humble beginnings in Poland, to the start of the turning point in the Caucauses - from all the major operations in the war, but also covering hypothetical situations - what would be the real outcome of a German invasion of the British Isles, or even an invasion of the American east coast?\n\nA strong variety of units are present. Progressive models of vehicles like tanks and fighters give you the oppertunity to upgrade as history produced each - even the late-war Panzer IV J has it's roots in the D model! Is the cost always worth it for the battle? Much of your choices may reflect necessities found in the real war, such as the shock of heavier armour in Barbarossa! Different types of each group present theirselves - infantry are diverse: light, heavy, mountain, paratroop, engineer, bridge-laying, cavalry, motorised and so on, and this type of diversity is continued in the unit groups. Upgrade your units! Infantry, anti-tank, artillery and the like can be given transport. The first option is the classic Opel Blitz truck, which gets you where you need. However, as a mere truck, it is highly susceptible to attack and as such many choose to upgrade some of their units to use the sd.kfz 251 or 250 halftracks which also benefit from the ability to fire when under attacked (or when the risky commander chooses to engage enemies!) Throughout the campaign, you also have the chance to obtain prototype and unique units, from the tremendous Schwere-Gustav railgun to the infamous Maus.\n\nFinally, if you wish to continue, the devs have bundled up new content in the form of two expansion packs, Allied & Afrika Corps, for a new experience, and the Grand Campaign which allows you to progress through all notable battles in the war: 1939 is now split into fourteen seperate scenarios! Carve your route through the war - your successes or failures will decide factors such as whether your force attacks through the Danzig North or Danzig South corridor in Poland, or whether to obey orders or mount an assault on the Dunkirk evacuation! Many of the scenarios have been bundled with unique objectives. For instance, one scenario in 1940 challenges you to assault positions to extract a French general and take him to the rear of the map, whilst one Polish situation requires you to halt troop trains to gain a decisive victory! Now get out there herr oberleutnant, and turn the course of the war!","November 29, 2014","true","151.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Like many other reviewers, I was a big fan of Panzer General and the Steel Thunder games back in the stone age. On the surface, Panzer Corps seems like a pretty straightforward reboot of those titles. It has a lot more depth, though. The game seems insanely easy to play at first--the interface is as straightforward and clear as anything. There are definitely right and wrong ways to do things, though.  It's rewarding to find out that Panzer Corps responds in the ways you expect it to, though--if you have a reasonable grasp of what the different unit types are supposed to do, it's fun to discover that your dreams of being an armchair Rommel actually work out.\n\nThere's a huge variety of unit types, and it's really fun to build up the core of your army throughout a campaign. You really start to care about your units. In one campaign I was invading Sicily and feeling way too confident...I let my prized British commando unit (elites that couldn't be replaced) get chewed up by the Germans when I got cocky. It was one of those slo-mo 'no no no nonooooooooooooooo' moments, hehe.\n\nOh, and after a bad day at work and/or with the gf/wife/whatever you've got, PC has the perfect solution to your problems.  Start a Wehrmacht '39 campaign on the easiest setting, and just roflstomp your way through the baby seals.\n\nGreat game.  Totally addictive.

Great fun (assuming you liked PG or turn based strategy in general), incredible diversity of scenarios if you buy the DLC. Gameplay and graphics are solid, never had an issue of any kind. If there is anything negative it is that the more difficult settings are well balanced in the early years of the Grand campaign (playing as Germany), but once you reach 1943 it becomes nearly impossible to maintain a core force and therefore you will also end up fielding units of old men and middle school kids. Playing as the Allies you will roll through later years of campaign. Of course this is what happened IRL and you might argue that the game reflects the historical imbalance of production/manpower and ultimately hopeless situation of the Nazi's. Either way it is fun, there is some replayability in terms of applying different mix of units to the same scenarios, and I keep coming back to it from time to time to try different strategies and increase the difficulty.  If you buy, get the Grand Campaign DLC and if it is ever in a Steam Sale this is a no brainer for any turn based strategy fans, particularly those who have fond memories of Panzer General or enjoy WWII as a setting.","December 21, 2014","true","986.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The default seemed a touch too easy but with the selection of AI 2 and increasing AI prestige I've got all the fight I want from the computer and more.\n\nVery fun. Just what I was looking for.\n\nSuggestions for improvement (or for a sequel) from me include:\n\n1) better color highlighting of units to distinguish friend from foe. My eyesight isn't what it used to be.\n2) better dynamic zooming of the battlefield instead of just  "in and out" with the map (ala sid meyer games)\n3) More detailed battlefield projection tooltips*\n\n*What I mean here is instead of a hover forcast of projection win-loss if I commit to an attack I would like not only those numbers but below them i would like a quick summary of why--i.e. why I am forcasted to lose 5 or half my strength is because my unit has a horrible hard attack and I am attacking a triple fortified hard opponent for example.\n\nI know I can find this information out by clicking each individual unit and will learn certain characteristics over time, but it would be nice to have some of this at hand without the additional clicking and number crunching.\n\nVery much recommend this game!","July 1, 2015","true","95.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Because depending how you play the game, whether you get a normal victory, or get your objectives done quickly to get a decisive victory, will change which missions you are given by high command.\n\nFor example the invasion of Poland; invade Poland efficiently and quickly, and show that you are worthy, and you will be assigned to take on the daunting task of the invasion of Norway.\nBut achieve a regular victory, and you'll be assigned to take Belgium instead.\n\nAlso you have core units which you maintain throughout the game, which can gain medals, have heroes within them recognized (giving a stat boost) and gain valuable experience.\n(Hint: Alt-Click on a unit to see it's war history and status)\n\nThere's just so much to enjoy here, this is a big game and if you get into it like I have been, will chew through your time.\nIt took me 6 hours, just to complete the Tutorial.\nAnd as of writing this I've logged 20 hours, and am only on Mission 3.\nThough mostly that's because I've had to restart each mission so many times to keep from out-right failing.\nIt's good to be challenged in the brain area by a game some times.\n\nAlso the game may look simple graphically, but non-the-less it draws you in.\nThe sprites are all HD and well-detailed, the sound effects make you feel like you're in the action,\nand even the muzzle flashes and smoke drawn during attacks give the game that much more of a 'feel'.\n\nThe downside to the game, if you'd call it that, is the DLC.\nDon't get me wrong, the DLC, from what I've heard, is awesome, and adds a heavy dose of content to the game.\nBut the price-tag is a little steep.\nThat being said I have only heard good things about the DLC and am planning on buying the lot of it soon.\n\nIf you're looking for a realistic, tactical-war turn-based strategy game, I cannot think of a better one out there.\nGet it 10/10, epic.","January 3, 2015","true","36.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

You'll be playing the campaign as any individual scenario is not particularly compelling and definitely is NOT a historical simulation of its respective battle.  The campaign is a blast to play, though as you'll be given a core force of Wehrmacht units representing Infantry, Artillery, Panzer, etc of possibly brigade/division size.  IMO, the units have no realistic size as the game is abstracted and for funsies.  As you conquer cities and finish battles, you'll accumulate "influence" points with which you can upgrade your existing units and buy new ones.  In addition, your units accumulate experience when they fight which will make them more effective and randomly generate leaders attached to the unit that gives them special abilities like +1 Movement, for example.  As the war progresses, new units will unlock as your original units become obsolete.  You'll start the war with PzKfw I and end with Tiger IIs.  The campaign has branching possibilities depending on the victory level you achieve, so it is possible to invade England, e.g.  My beefs with the game are few.  The main one being that the base game is short (but replayable) and to properly enjoy the game, one should purchase the Grand Campaign.  The game overall has an admirable level of polish.  Wish there was more animation. Don't expect depth or realism.  This is War lite, playable while drunk.","November 29, 2014","true","233.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Each scenario you are tasked with deploying your troops and taking a set number of objectives across the map. Units earn experience and can be upgraded during the deployment phase with any new equipment unlocked. This is done using prestige points that you acquire by completing objectives and are also used to reinforce units during battle when they lose strength. Prestige points are persistent throughout the campaign meaning spending all of your points in one battle may not be wise as you are effectively depleting your resources for the next engagement; although you do receive some at the beginning of each scenario, what you have carries over.\n\nThe graphics of Panzer Corps are fairly basic although nice to look at with each type of unit distinguishable from each other. Sounds can also said to be somewhat basic as each unit type has a single sound that is played during movement and attack. This may sound repetitive however after 18 hours of playing Panzer Corps I can say this has yet to bother me. The interface is effective at doing the job and gives you access to all of the information you need without being intrusive.\n\nPanzer Corps strikes a great balance between depth and accessibility and offers a great entry point into wargames for the uninitiated. The gameplay is addictive and the visuals and audio serve the game well, while the multiplayer uses a play-by-email method so multiple games can be played at once over the course of a few or more days.\n\nPanzer Corps has quickly become one of my favourite games and I would happily recommend it to anyone.","March 30, 2014","true","68.3"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

Large variety of units to build your core army with throughout the game, there is nothing like having an early panzer crew survive long enough that they are a vetern Tiger crew by the games end.  Only downside is the Afrika Corps and Allied Corps are not stand alone because the original Panzer Corps is made obsolete by the Grand Campaign DLCs.  The Grand Campaign DLCs are by far the best value in each being a whole campaign in which your core units are saved and can be carried over to the next chapter of the war.  Allied Corps is great and allows you to play the western Allies starting in North Africa until victory in Western Europe.  Afrika Corps is great and featres some of the more challenging battles in the series while focusing on DAK and Italian forces in North Africa.

The game allows the same feel and design as the original series which was a extremely popular turn base WWII game way back in the day.\n\nYou have the ability to buy units, upgrade them and go all out war with them. There isn't much else to say as it's very simple to understand and follow once you get in.\n\nThe only issue I have with panzer corps which has been something appearing and disappearing from the Panzer General series is the more detailed outcome of engagements. In Panzer General you had the ability to turn on/off a small animation that is played on the top of  your screen which shows you two cycles one being the attacking force and the other being the defending force. This animation was extremely interesting as it showed you what your units were attacking and how much damage they are doing in a visual appearance instead of the basic fly over a target and see a smoke cloud appear and numbers go down.\n\nOverall the game is extremely fun for those wanting a turn base game as well as something that doesn't really need much thought just mainly which units can effectively counter the other. If your really 50/50 on it just wait for a sale the price is extremely cheap during this time...as well as it won't laugh at you for hating it so much.......I really hate you brink...you simply just sit in my library mocking me....with all bugs...one day I will have my revenge","December 31, 2014","true","3.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

This has taken the great gameplay of the original and made it better by adding some new features (such as railway movement).\n\nThe base game lets you play a campaign as the Axis where your core army survivors are taken from mission to mission through the historical battles of the war.   Its quite compelling to see your army gain experience over time, units gain medals and heroes occassionally appear.   Most missions involve capturing set objectives within time limits and if you are very successful then "historical what if" missions appear like the invasions of Britain and the USA.\n\nThere is a lot of hours of gameplay in the base game alone, so dont be put off by all the DLC.   I cant comment on the Grand Campaigns as I havent bought those.  I do own the Allied Corps expansion which is a meaty expansion of the game allowing you to play the WWII campaign as the British or US.\n\nYou also might like it even if you dont normally play wargames as it is not complex and the battles are fast and fun.","March 14, 2014","true","100.9"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","1"

Certainly for players who remember Panzer General and any of it's successors. This is the ultimate version.\n\nFor player who don't know this legendary game: this game keeps it simple in graphics and sound but that is also what makes you focus on the tactical gameplay of the scenario's and the strategic building of your army core.\nOn the surface this game looks deceivingly simple but once you get to know all the game mechanics, you will soon understand how much planning and thought you can put in this game on the higher difficulty levels. The game mechanics are sadly not all super transparent at first, but using CTRL Click on a unit give you a detailed combat prediction and "L" give you the actual combat result from the last combat.\n\nDon't be misdirected by the many DLC's, keep in mind that this game was released in late 2011. The Grand Campaign let's you replay historical scenario's. As the basic game give you more a revisit of the original Panzer General scenario's with extra's (heroes) and some improvements like interface and gameplay settings.\n\nI haven't played Allied Corps or Afrika Corps but those two games bring a whole other twist to the game.\n\nAnd I haven't even talked about all the cool Mods and custom scenario's that have been build for this game. Just check out the forums of Slitherine if you want to get to the bottem of this game.\n\nFor me, as a fan of the turn-based tactical and strategic games, this is the perfect WWII game. It focusses on the main issues at hand: how to succeed in combat. Logistics seem too simple at first glance but you will learn that if you don't keep your troops together you will soon be out of supplies and find that your units can't perform any more.\n\nSo this game get's 9/10 from me.","March 12, 2014","true","25.6"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mcdonis/recommended/268400/","mcdonis","McDonis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mcdonis/","631 products in account","Easily my favorite war game on PC was the SSI classic Panzer General (1993).   PG went on to have 4-5 sequals and generally was a fan favorite for a decade.   Luckly for us Slitherine decided to dust off this classic with a bit newer graphics but the same old fun gameplay.   If you loved PG then stop reading this review buy the game and play.  If you are new to the series lets go over what makes it fun.  First unlike many other war games its very easy to pick up learn and enjoy.  Most gamers should be able to pick up most of what they need to learn in under 30 minutes of play.  Next for those of us who like detail but dislike horrible interfaces Panzer Corps has an easy to use interface that is nearly perfict.  Finally the depth of the historical missions are fun and exciting.  Eventually you will get attached to some of your brigades and be pitching a fit if one gets nailed in a bad spot.   Now for the bad....\n\nOne area that really could use some help is music, its ok but after awhile you wish you could just turn it off.  Its not cheep but its not well done.  Also while they were faithfull to the old PG game they really didnt try to bring in something new that would wow the audience.  Perhaps a research element, perhaps better naval options, perhaps better ways to manage air cover who knows but they really didnt change any core gameplay.  Yes this isnt necessarly a bad thing PG was a darn good game but that was 20 years ago.\n\nAll in all the game is easily worth 50 without the DLC.  If you are a wargamer this is a must buy if there ever was one.  If you are on the fence or just havent played a war game before I would say there is no other game that could possibly be a better game to try.","March 15, 2014","true","685.3"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

Then this just might be for you!\n\nDespite a somewhat elderly appearance, this game offers quite a bit of depth and does (especially true with its expansions and Grand Campaign) allow you some degree of choice. Also your units follow you from fight to fight (IF they survive).\nIt also has a fairly alright difficulty editor for those of us who might not exactly be Eisenhower, Rommel or Montgomery, in terms of strategic prowess, so to a degree you can tailor your difficulty!\n\nMy recommendation, if you like strategy, and would enjoy taking it online, you should indeed give it a spin!

Many people will remember Panzer General from many years ago and you can still download it for free! The game might have been dressed up a bit but it's basically just the same limp excuse for a wargame - at least many years ago it seemed acceptable as there wasn't much else available because of the pc's being basic. At best it was an ok boardgame type game but doesn't have the realism of Battle Academy or Close Combat, or Combat Mission either. I don't know what scale these battles are supposed to be represented in, certainly not at the small scale seen in BA, CM or CC. In PC the battlefields are on a much larger scale which makes the problem of infantry not accompanying tanks in the same hex laughable. The Devs have also DLC'd it to death and if you buy the lot then you're going to part with a small fortune. I tried just the base game and at once I could see it was the same old game just with new window dressing.

The frustration comes from almost winning the scenario with 2 moves to go, the enemy gets some inexplicably lucky hits and boom..you lose!  That being said, it is one of the few games you really dont mind having to repeat your battles until you find the right "puzzle" to win.  I t really makes you careully strategize your moves.  For example..do you overstrengh and upgrade your elite units, or do you spend  your points on some new units of a type you don't have.?  The choice is yours, and you will find out, painfully, that it may not have been the correct one?  Does the AI "cheat?"  Maybe, or i am just a slow learner.

Panzer Corps is a turned-based 2D game which means that you organise your movements, attacks or other strategic action before the enemy does his.\n\nThe German campaign will lead you in several theaters of the war such as the invasion of France, the taking of Norwegian's Narvik city, the assistance of Italian troops in their invasion of Greece or the famous operation Barbarossa. The campaign offers a continuity in the various operations which means you will keep your units from a theater to another. That way you will quickly care for your troops as they gain experience, medals and war heroes and you will try to keep the best of your regiments alive. Loosing a battle does not mean the end of the campaign or that you will automatically have to start again but you will continue the fight with a scenario according to your defeat.\n\nNow let's see the highs and lows of the game :[/b]\n\n- Good replayability : with various difficulties and numerous strategies possible you will like to start again a scenario and try to win it a different way.\n- The difficulty levels : They really offer a different difficulty which will accomodate the different kinds of players from novice to the master generals/\n- The map is not just there to be pretty: Like a proper wargame, terrains matter. You may not want to attack while crossing a river, forests take longer to cross and units will move differently depending on their transport system ( trucks, on foot,...Etc )\n- Graphisms : Some will say come on we are in the 2010s but I like the graphism. The interface is very good and clean which is not always the case in these games and the units are clean as well. Once you are accustomed you will recognize the unit by their looks easily.\n- The sounds : there are not many sounds but they are correct and not horrible. Repetitive but very correct. The same goes with the music, it's not an epic music but it's enjoyable You may quickly forget that there is music though.\n- Multiplayer\n-Tutorial ( some games forget about tutorials so it's a good point. I jumped right into the game but for novice players it is important ).\n- There are achievements will add some new objectives if you like that kind of things.\n- Very fast, the end turns are quick ( The End of All Wars ? )\n- There is a demo on the official website. Some people don't care but I find very important that games have a demo, only to see if it works on your computer.\n\n- Where are the objectives ? Only when you end you turn and that's a shame. It's either hidden very well and in that case it's a low point as well but I can't find a single button to see my objectives during my turn.\n\nWhat follows is neither a high nor a low point: The DLCs. They had several new campaign ( the base game with the German campaign and the multiplayer already offers a lotn enough to see if you like the game ) such as with the Afrika Corps, the allied or more focused scenarios such as the year 1940,...Etc I bought two of them and I am happy with them. DLCs don't take away anything from the base game they just had new campaigns for those who want more. Some may not like it but at least features were not taken from the base game to be sold after as DLCs like so many games do.\n\nSo I highly recommand this, for old Panzer General and the like fans as well for novice in this genre. It's very intuitive and you will soon get into the game without headaches. During my first play, I find myself playing three hours in a row withou t noticing time passing. 8.5/10","December 5, 2014","true","9.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
