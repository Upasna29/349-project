Your goal is to protect the colonists from the zombies, while they drill for something and paying you for your services. The colonists are actually not visible in game, you know, that they are behind you and you're their last line of defense against the horde of incoming zombies in front of you. In other words, zombies swarm from the top of the map, if they reach the bottom, they'll kill / eat / infect your colonists. For each zombie, that you let past you, you lose 1 colonist. It's very important to keep all your colonists alive, as they are your main income - the more you have, the more you earn after each "patrol". Patrols are the standard levels in the campaign, where zombies will try to breach your base and you need to kill 'em all. Other than patrols, there are "arena" levels - where you just need to survive against the zombies, until the clock runs out, and you have none of the defenses that you have set up for your standard levels. There are also a "rescue" type levels - same as the arena one, but there is a npc and a defensive turret or two, that help you out and you need to protect the npc. If successful, the npc will increase the number of your colonists by 1, so that's always nice. In the rescue levels, you can issue commands to the npc - to stay his ground or follow you, you can give him one of your weapons to use it, and you get it back at the end of the mission with your ammo still intact, so that's pretty viable.\nMost of the levels will still be a "patrol" ones, and you need to be ready for the incoming zombies. Preparing your defenses is where the tower defense gameplay comes to light. You can set up mines( the number of the mines you can use depends on your character's mechanical attribute), save the formation you set the mines in, add turrets, upgrade your existing ones, repair them and so on and so fort - being prepared is half the battle! Mines don't cost you money, but the turrets do, and they are pretty pricy. so you need to keep an eye on them in battle - to repair them, before they explode from damage, to reload them, when they run out of ammo and you haven't researched the auto-reloader yet, and stuff like that.\nThe character progression feels reasonable - I'm 3 hours into the campaign, I'm level 15 and have completed 20 levels / missions, but there are so much upgrades and cool things I wanna try and do - I guess the game is gonna be pretty long. If you want a faster progression you can always go try the survival mode - for highscore glory and to maybe check out one of the perks you want to try in campaign, but it's description wasn't good enough for you and you wanna see it in action (yea some of the perks could use more clarification in the description, or maybe they are intended that way).\nAs for the weapons types - pistol with infinite ammo is your best choice. You have shotgun, SMG and a sniper, that require you to buy / carry ammo for them. You can have one of each weapon type with you on a mission, given that your character can carry the load - I'm level 15 and usually run with 3. I think by now I have unlocked 3 tiers of weapons, the first ones are pretty bad, as you need all the dosh you can spare for buying turrets or a better pistols, instead of weapons that use expensive ammo and don't really do that much damage in battle. I haven't tried the sniper yet, but the shotgun really does feel underwhelming (the tier one at least, did not invest into another one after it). The SMG is ok, I like it, because I can just hold my mouse button pressed and spray, while for every other weapon you need to press LMB for each shot - I really wish they implement something to improve on that, or maybe a later tier weapons have that automatic fire?\nThe enemies could use a little more diversity - for 3 hours in I fought most of the time just 3 types of enemies - a slow walking zombie, a fast moving zombie hound and a "commander", that walks further back and buffs the other zombies randomly. Just recently a 4th type of enemy presented itself - the range shooting zombie and I've seen a zombie hounds with explosives on their back in survival mode.\nThe music is ok, most of the time I'm too busy to notice it though ;) The weapon sounds could be a lot better, but are still reasonable. The story is probably good, I liked the intro, but when you start the campaign you can choose to have a story, have a farce story or no story just pew pew, and I chose the latter :p . Can only imagine how much fun the local coop is, but sadly I have not had the opportunity to test it yet.\nThe graphics are ok - reasonable, but nothing special, its an indie title after all. There are night missions, where you vision will be reduced, but you can throw some flares around, and all your weapons and turrets have flashlight on. There are sandstorms, that obscure your vision and lightnings that mess up your electronics - all looking reasonably well.I would like to see a vsync option though, as I think I've noticed some tearing in rare occasions.\nThe controls are fine, but I would love to be able to assign keys to my individual weapon slots, instead of having to scroll through them. Same applies for the inventory items.\nSo yea, Deadstone is a pretty well rounded game, pretty easy to recommend, even when it comes off sale!\n\nTL:DR you can check my overview video - failing "day 20", showing some survival mode, and going back to beat the level.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=340928336","November 12, 2014","true","4.3"," 29 of 37 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","29","37","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chlorique/recommended/327150/","chlorique","Chlorique Queas","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chlorique/","696 products in account","TL;DR Deadstone, a classic 2D top down shooter where you defend a base against a parasitic incursion, campaign is a bit long but the story is interesting enough to slog through. That and survival mode is good for a quick session. Also has Co-Op mode! If you are interested please read the important note located at the bottom of this review.\n\nGame Info\nName: Deadstone\nDeveloper: Timeslip Softworks\nGenre: Lite-Rpg, Base Defense, Hoard Mode, Top Down Shooter, CO-OP\nPersonal Verdict: A fun enough game even if the story streches on for too long. 6/10\nOfficial Website: http://deadstonegame.com/\n\nWhat is Deadstone? Pretty much your decent game about defending a single line offscreen from being penetrated by hoards of the living dead that wants to eat your colonist's face off. Oh and its set on Mars with a pretty good story decent story but too bad that the amount of levels drags on for a little bit with some levels having no dialogs at all. Despite this the game is still quite fun to play through. Oh and it has survival mode, thats something. Also has co-op mode!\n\nShort Intro\nOnboard the space station Icarus man perform terrible experiment on the very human life. Now that these monsters has escaped it is up to you to protect what remain of the colony below, the colony of DEADSTONE.\n\n1:Graphics\nThe game isn't exactly pretty but considering that it is just a simple 2D top down shooter i say the graphics does its job well enough. Although the effects are somehwat underwhelming for things such as explosion. The menu interface and the rare artwork are undenieably good looking at least.\n\n2:Sound\nGeneric sounding music for everything with zombies grunt, guns shoots and explosion fires. The music is hardly noticeably during gameplay and overall the sound exist for the sake of at least not making things feel empty.\n\n3:Gameplay\nYour character moves around a static map with a weapon status, health bar and a minimap displayed on the corner of the screen. The game objective is to shoot the zombies coming from the top of the screen and prevent them from reaching the bottom screen otherwise in standard game like this you lose a single colonist. The zombies can and will harm you and in the later levels they come in so thick you will find yourself healing, shooting and running away constantly like  mad game of juggling.\n\nColonist serves several purposes, they act as life point where a single number of them gets deducted for every zombies that made it through and at the end of every patrol you are awarded with extra exp and money for every surviving colonist. The game does mix up the game type with 3 different mode, patrol which is the bog standard 'Don't let em come close' mode, Colonist rescue where you defend a location with a colonist for a limited amount of time to extract them and alstly arena where it is just you, no defense no turrets against an endless wave of enemies while being waiting for the timer to countdown.\n\nEXP gained from completing patrols are used to level up your characters in several aspect like speed, accuracy, mechanical and endurance. For every 2 level up you also gain a single perk point to be spend on gaining a single perk but better perks are locked behind a high skill point requirement so planning ahead is rather important.\n\nTo aid you in defending the colony and killing zombies you have guns and turrets and mines at your disposal. You can carry up to 4 different types of weapon at a time although you must have several points in endurance first in order to carry the heavier ones with you into patrol. Mines and turret can be place before every round. New types of turrets can be researched at the lab along with weapons upgrade as well. Everything cost money though and it is a good idea to start saving up money for the later round and upgrades.\n\nEnemies come in several different types and shapes with in order to avoid spoilers the shambler and the runner make up most of the type you will kill. Do note the game has a unique system where every spawn enemies has different stats which results in some of them being able to walk fast, take more hits but during the heat of the battle it's really quite hard to tell.\n\nThe game has campaign mode and survival mode. The campaign mode is a tad long for my taste and the survival mode is basically a strip down campaign mode where the objective is to survive for as long as humanly possible.\n\nThe game also supports local co-op mode but an Xbox controller is required for it.\n\nConclusion\nDEADSTONE, decent top down shooter game that doesn't shake up the formula but it does what it does surpisingly well enough but unfortunatedly the long campaign and lack of diverse background hurts the game slightly. Also please read the important note below.\n\nVerdict: Buy it if you like this kind of game.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE Thankfully i went over the official site and discover according to the faq that some of the game mode and mutation are not available if you chose a lower setting and testing confirms this. Here is the faq in question:\n\nQ: Can you explain how the quality settings impact the game?\nLow: Lower resolution textures, no night missions, no dust storms, limited effects.\nMedium: Medium resolution textures, night missions with lower quality lighting, no dust storms, limited effects.\nHigh: High resolution textures, night missions with high quality lighting, dust storms active, high effects.\nHighest: High resolution textures, night missions with additional high quality lighting, dust storms active, maximum effects.\n\nKeep this in mind when choosing the settings.\n\nTIPS!\nSpecialize early on, if you chose to go with turret + gunner build you wil lsuffer late game.\nYou can very easily survive the first 10 days without actually buying anything but a better pistol. The first shotgun is horrible. Use this info to farm up cash.\nArmor upgrade is kinda pointless for the first 20 days. Go get the bandolier instead.\nFor turret upgrade: Rate of fire + reload time is the most important. Also don't bother with the scatter turret because the machinegun turret is already good enough for all situation.\n\nOnce again i am Chlorique Queas and thank you for reading my review!\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group\n\nCheck out the Original Network Groups.

I wholeheartedly recommend it if you like the genres in question, and want some arcadey fun.\n\nThe writing is solid, the voice acting in the intro is also solid.  We're not talking Bioware here, but by the standards of the indie games I've played, both stood out as better than the average Greenlight.  While this sounds like faint praise, I was actually quite impressed.  When I actually notice the voice acting and writing in a top-down shooter, it means they actually put some worthwhile time into both.\n\nMy two recommendations, gameplay wise:\n* Provide more information on what your levelling decisions mean.  When levelling various stats, or picking certain perks (Headhunter comes to mind) it's slightly harder to make an informed decision than I'd like.\n* I have yet to find a use for the first starting guns other than an emergency second clip when my pistol needs reloading.  My pistol and shotgun seem to take roughly the same number of shots to put something down.  At least the first tier of guns feels underwhelming, especially since you need to pay for ammo.","November 12, 2014","true","4.0"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","16","21","2","1"

There is also a really cool UI Function where you set up ans save defense layouts before a mission adding a nice splash of tower defense to the gameplay. With  that you can better cover all your zones more effectively. All the controls are really tight and responsive the game rewards you for being accurate and efficent.\n\nThe game has a good story with great characters and well written dialogue. The game also features a survival mode as well as co-op.\n\nFor the Twin Stick Enthusiast, this zombie wrecking action is totally worthwhile. :)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/B3kKK0z7W3g","September 19, 2015","true","3.1"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kitswulf/recommended/327150/","kitswulf","Kitswulf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kitswulf/","211 products in account","Overall a rather cute and pleasant game. The controls are smooth, the RPG elements give you interesting synergistic options (in short, are you an 80's Action Hero, Grizzled Demolitions Expert or a Tower Defense Engineer?), and the story has some well-written characters. Shooting zombies feels satisfying, and there are 3 game modes even in the story missions (Patrol, a TD-style; Arena, a survival match; Rescue, what it says on the tin) so it doesn't wear out its welcome. It even has a "Side B" story that's a parody of the main story for added replay value.\n\nI will say I didn't like the enemies growing tougher over time (literally tougher, nothing changed except their HP went up) because it didn't make the game harder, but it DID remove any sense of progress in a lot of the RPG elements. I played on normal, and every time my damage went up, the enemies seemed to increase their HP by an equal amount so that I never felt a sense of progression, but never felt like the enemy was growing harder, either. There are only 5 enemy types; they start off mildly threatening, and thanks to HP growth, they end up mildly threatening by the end as well. I'd also say that the main campaign was wearing out its welcome a bit by the end, you could probably trim 10 days off without really losing a sense of the game's fun. Additionally, the story ended up falling a little flat as you realize it's more a first act of an arc than a complete story, and I kept waiting for a twist that never appeared.\n\nI'm sandwiching my complaints between two positive paragraphs because again, overall, I am quite satisfied with this game. The leveling system was elegant, the weapons satisfying, the controls smooth, and the characters well-written. If you like twin-stick shooters with a pretty heavy RPG component (both in leveling mechanics and having a character-driven story) this game will scratch that itch quite well.","October 3, 2015","true","8.6"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

I was also both impressed and pleasantly surprised by the quality of the voice acting and the dialogue.  There are three game modes available and assuming they each take a few hours to complete a single playthru (I haven't gotten far enough to gauge that yet) then yes, $10 is worth the price of admission.  Just be advised that the main campaign starts off slow and may bore you a bit, but you'll soon unlock enough stuff to the point where you'll need to choose what you'll bring with you into the next patrol.  Pretty fun game, in my opinion.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZCg6mhjGZo","January 22, 2015","true","1.2"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","9","12","2","0"

Hitting zombies in the center results in more damage, and rewards accurate gameplay without being too reliant on it. The progression system makes your character really feel like your own: there are hundreds of combinations you can end up putting together from relying on sentries and the tower defense elements to protect you, to being a speedy shotgunner running around hitting everything.\n\nThe problem the game faces is a very long campaign that goes way too long, and the variety hits a very strong wall ast the environment and enemies don't have that much variety to it. The lack of guns variety hurts too, 4 base types are a little disappointing as the guns have a vast variety to them in terms of available stats. The art style isn't the greatest, and will get boring to look at.\n\nHonestly though, it's one of those games that will be a challenge to see how far you can get, and if you like the top-down shooter genre, it's definitely worth a look. It's not a world changer, but it's a solid average shooter that definitely will appeal to fans of the genre.\n\nI did an official review and video for TechRaptor over here: http://techraptor.net/content/deadstone-review-just-average-exploding-zombie-dogs","November 14, 2014","true","15.2"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","9","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sharpincome/recommended/327150/","sharpincome","Sharp Income","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sharpincome/","1122 products in account","TLDR:\nGood game. Buy it on sale. See conclusion for what sets it apart from other TDS games.\n\n\n\nIt's a simple top down shooter. The main shooting gameplay is simple and repeatative as such is the typical restriction of the TDS genre, but yet also at times pretty intense and challenging. And the gameplay as a whole is a repeatative cycle of mission then prepare for the next mission but keeps the player in a comfortable flow that removes the negative feelings of repeatativeness and replaces it with anticipation. Anticipation for what new gear can I buy, or just waiting to get a break from a very tense, challenging mission. The flow and changes in action to strategy is balanced very well and keeps the player engaged. Missions are challenging so you'll actually appreciate the break from the action and also really enjoy it due to the fact that the player is given so many decisions to make regarding planning the next mission.\n\nAs for the missions, they start with an interesting, well written page of dialogue. Usually I hate having to read through sentence after sentence of character interaction (just let me get to killing something!) but the dialogue is interesting and well written such that each sentence is meaningful. I didn't want to miss any of it! Then the action begins. The enemies come from the top and you're trying to kill 'em off as fast as possible so as to not to let any get into the base (get past the bottom of the map). If they do, you'll loose a survivor and that means your research upgrades come slower. So you've got to keep an eye on your surroundings so you don't get mauled by zombies, also watch your ammo and look for the right time to reload vs switch weapon, and keep a third eye on your radar in case there are zombies elsewhere slipping through your defenses! It'll be a sigh of relief when you finish your mission and you'll definitely be looking forward to the break in the action where you can take your time to plan out your defenses for the next mission. Before I get to describing the strategic part, there are also rescue and survival type missions where you must survive for a certain amount of time. These are on separate maps/areas, where you won't have your turrets, mines to help you out. You can also seperately play survival mode apart from the campaign.\n\nNow, for the strategic aspect. This is an rpg. You gain XP which will allow you to unlock perks for your character from a plethora of options. You also earn stat points to increase things like constitution, speed, accuracy and mechanics. Speed is for movement speed; accuracy is weapon accuracy. Constition allows you to carry more ammo (you can also buy an bandolier which will further increase your ammo capacity), but constitution also allows you to use the more advanced weapons you'll unlock through research. The research is done automatically by the survivors. You'll start the game with a set number and you can loose them if enemies get past the bottom end of the map on the missions. Through the mechanics stat you'll unlock access to mines and turrets and you'll be able to lay them out on the map and save the layout before starting your next mission. As you increase this stat you'll be able to buy and place more mines and buy upgrades for your turrets. An interesting point is that turrets initially need to be manually reloaded (by standing by them) which adds more tactical depth to the missions.\n\nNext the weapons. There are four classes and I think 3 or 4 levels for each weapon class. You have pistols , an automatic type of gun (smg and ARs), a rifle (sniper rilfe/bolt action) slower rate of fire used as your precision, long range weapon, and a shotgun to complete the balanced ensamble. You can equip 4 weapons at a time, so you'll want to have one of each so you have a balanced arsenal on the battle field. But don't try to purchase each one right away. It may be better to spend your precious money on different upgrades or ammo. Instead of upgrading the weapons' individual stats, you'll unlock a more powerful version of each weapon in the class (which gives you the option of skipping an entire tier if you want to save some money). Having these 4 distinct classes keeps the weapons balanced and adds tactical depth to the gameplay as each serves their own specific purpose. Reload times are significant in this game which gives the pistol usefulness as a backup weapon (as it serves in real life), and also adds to the tension. Your move speed is also somewhat slow which makes having a precision weapon important. You can use it to take out that lone enemy on the other side of the map so you don't have to give up your current position that your holding to take out a more numerous threat.  (You don't want to let even one enemy through). Then there's the automatic weapons, probably your most used weapon to mow down the hoards. And when the mobs get closer and you need to deal with them quickly pull out your powerful shotgun whose spread can hit multiple enemies at once and saves you time from having to aim precisely.\n\nYou'll also have usable items to help you in the field. A detpack (explosive, can be used to take out burrow holes where enemies spawn from), a health pack to heal yourself on the fly, and a flares you can place around the map to help you see at night.\n\nThe only negative I have with this is that it still is repeatative. You are on the same map for the majority of the game. There are a few other maps for arena/survival missions and rescue missions, but I think it'd be better if there could've been say 4 different enterances to the survivors' base that you had to defend. And if there could of been some kind of debri or something that you could take cover behind, something you could shoot over that the enemies would have to walk around, or large rocks you could use to hide behind (and not shoot over)... that would be awesome. (And rotating camera view, fixed behind the player like a third person shooter, would be cool too.) Even so, this game would keep me engaged for an hour or so at a time. I'd do maybe about 5 missions in a play session and I thoroughly enjoy it.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nThe excellent flow of gameplay, strategic planning before the action in each mission, the interesting story and dialogue, and the abundant choices in gear/upgrades and options for difficulty (& even choice of which story: serious or tongue in cheek!) and relatively lengthy campaign is what makes this game stand out from the rest of the TDS market.

I finished campaing in 9 hours including restarting once due to incorrect spendings and upgrades. And I don't see any reason to play survival mode or replay the campaign. Probably I return to this game again after several months.\nPros: I was withdrawn from real life for these 9 hours. The game is so addictive, you just can't stop playing... until the campaign is finished and you understand that you had enough of it.\n\nThis game ends sooner than becomes boring, which is rare for present-day games.\nConsidering game's price I highly recommend it and look forward for new games from this developer,\nbtw I don't see much reason in updating this game more, it's already nearly perfect.\n","May 10, 2015","true","11.6"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

There is an extensive array of weaponry available, as well as placeable mines and turrets, with a deep and wholly satisfying range of upgrades for all of them. Likewise, the system of perks and stats for your character and the pacing at which you unlock all of the things I've mentioned are all top-notch.\n\nI'm over 5 hours in, and I'm only just beginning. I'm likely going to put a lot of hours into this game, an hour here and an hour there. Lots of action and replay value.

After each wave of enemies you gain experience points an money to level up your charachter. There is a great variety of weapons and perks to select from. The voice acting and the cut scenes are done well. Unfortunatley the sprites and the menu graphics look quite lackluster. The level backgrounds also are very uninspired, have no detail and remind me more of  tiled desktop wallpapers from the 90s than anything else. Another weakness of this game are the few enemy types. This makes the gameplay feel very repetitive. On the bright side the developer is still improving the game and listens to suggestions from the players. I'm really a fan of top down shooters and despite the weak points I just mentioned I still had great fun finishing the campaign! The game does enough things right to still make it a cool experience. I'm not sure if I would pay full price for it but if it's on sale and you like the genre give it a try!","May 6, 2015","true","8.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fourhorseman/recommended/327150/","fourhorseman","Four Horseman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fourhorseman/","243 products in account","Deadstone is a rather fun top-down shooter with RPG and mild tower defense elements thrown in.  There is a campaign and survial mode, and a lot of replayability even once you complete the normal campaign.  I really can't judge this style of   game on graphical quality...but I have for sure seen better looking top-down shooters.  I would say that my favorite aspect of Deadstone are the RPG elements....you level up your character and weapons with the xp and money you earn while completing campaign missions.  Money can be pretty tight, so I always start out getting the "extra money" perks right out of the gate.\nSurvival mode leaves a little to be desired in my opinion...you start off with a few stat points and perk points, as well as a little bit of money (emphasis on little).  Maybee if you survive log enough you are given additional chances to buy weapons and upgrade your stats and perks, but I have never gotten that far. This means that the little amount of money you start out with has to be used sparingly to say the least.  You are given a default pistol and 500$...but the least expensive weapon is 400, plus you have to buy ammo, med packs, explosives, etc...\nI am recomending this game as I have so much fun playing it...if you can pick it up on sale it's a no loose situation.","May 11, 2015","true","6.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

For $10 I would not recommend, for $1, I might recommend, but it's really up to whether you can justify paying for an experience you could probably get for free from a hundred better games on armor games.\n\nI was going to write a much longer and more detailed review but just read the tl;dr. this game feels like it's from the 90s, the graphics are bad, the voice acting (where present) is bad, the sound is bad, the story/writing is bad, the one level you play is poorly made, the controls are bad, the gameplay is poor when the standard for shooting defense games is so easy to succeed on... I mean there's so much about this game that just screams bad.\n\nOn the plus side the rpg elements are there, you can find perks (which I'm not convinced work, cause the magnet skills didn't work for me????????), stats, a shop, and a building menu that is present between levels. I found it's the only redeemable feature of the game. The rest of it plays very poorly and the low level graphics are not quite pixel cute nor are they full graphics, they're just so-so.\n\nThe game just plays horribly bad and it makes me not want to play it. Also tried to switch to a controller, but even with the rotation speed maxed out it still moves too slow to react. So the only way to play this is on a keyboard and mouse.. Oh and bullets fired from a pistol move so slow you can't hit anything more than right next to you.. no joke.. and I get that maybe they made it that way to keep the accuracy on pistols down after a certain distance, but come-on, the gun already does no damage.\n\nI really don't understand the other 10 reviews (all positive), I found the game to be virtually unplayable.\n\nSo save your money unless you really need steam trading cards, because that's the only redeemable aspect of owning this game.","December 17, 2014","false","1.3"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","0"
