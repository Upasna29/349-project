Developer removes threads with criticism and bans users with legitimate constructive criticism. I was banned for "arguing with moderator" despite there not being an argument or elevated tone even. My criticism was that I had concerns at their ability as a small team to manage creating MP and SP experiences when even large experienced teams know that you have to focus on one then the other. This opinion was in a thread where the OP asked if the game was worth playing. The thread was removed since three people responded that it was not, with supporting, rational evidence. This developer is immature and irresponsible. Trying to remove the evidence of a poorly made and poorly managed game is unforgiveable in a community built on trust.\n\nThe game itself has potential but no population, as do many of these PVP/crafting/survival games that have flooded early access recently. The game is built with Unity and mostly generic assets patched together. The single programmer/dev is a bit too cocky in thinking that you can just slap together an MMO in a few months using pre-built resources. This is a student project level game and they are charging way too much without the ability to deliver a stable experience.\n\nServers are unstable despite twice weekly reports of massive improvements. Walls disappear, inventory moves around or changes completely between logging in and out. A well known chat bug causes a major lag spike but continues unfixed. The servers lag despite populations of under 5 people at any time.\n\nI could list technical problems for another 1000 words, but the bottom line is that there are responsible, dedicated, mature and capable devs out there with similar games. Go buy them instead.","September 7, 2014","false","4.1"," 672 of 699 people (96%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","96","672","699","13","24"

There is an east, west and european server list. 4 servers per. You will never see more than 5 people spread across the servers trying to find one that works. Memory leaks are rampant, you can build a two story castle log for 2 minutes return and notice whole sections missing. Wanna raid your neighbors castle? No problem just log out next to his outside wall log in and before the game can draw anything (5 seconds) simply walk forward a few steps and his castle will eventually build around you. The list of things not working with the game is truly to long to list. If you enjoy building castles only to see parts of them magically disapear, doors that dont open, or walls you place suddenly flip sideways then this is the game for you. Well i made it over 137 hours played of some of the worst gameing garbage i have ever seen. In my defence at wasting 137 hours on this i had an operation that kept me at home for several weeks. The game is garbage in every way and when you speak to them you realize its a "its my dream and its gunna work even if nobody plays it situation". trust me save your 20 bucks even watching Oprah would be better than this mess.

It's thee worse. Be warned, this game is on par with Superman 64. The leather armor I crafted actually made me weaker, not stronger than at start, I craft arrows, they don't show up in my inventory but the ingredients are gone. I try to stack expensive items (that should have been stacked already) and end up with them disappearing altogether in the process. It was only three dollars, yet I've never wanted a refund more, they don't even deserve that,\n\nOh, and I was even blocked from the official servers, meaning I can't play the game. Don't forget that Steam offers refunds now, they hadn't made that change back when I played the game, be sure to get your money back when you inevitably realize that this is the worst game in history if you make the mistake of buying it.

(obviously not on this steam review since they can't remove theses reviews)\nI wanted to warn others to stay clear from this game, solely because of the unprofessional and rude Developer team.\nPlease read the reviews before even thinking of getting this game, and you can clearly see the Developer responding to reviews ( in a rude matter), clearly unable to handle criticism.\n\nI gave the game a whrool, for a little while and just didn't want to play anymore.\nThis game looks as if its was some beta 14 years old. It looks horrific. They shouldn't be charging people for this game, or at least not $20. This game looks like the type of game that would cost like 500 microsoft points on a xbox live marketplace, thats how low qauilty this game is. As I was playing the game, I was cliping throgh a whole bunch of stuff, I clipped through stairs, trees, etc. Not only was I walking through things, so were the enemy AIs, one Ai just ran through this wooden thing and just owned me.\n\nEverything just looks unattartive, and doesn't feel like a finished game. (i know its early access, but as i was reading the Developer's comment about the game, stating this game is going be a finish product in just about two months, and the main things that are going to change is slighty better graphics, ( and some other things)\nThis game looks like it needs a ♥♥♥♥♥on more time than just two or so months.\n\nMan the first time I joined it I appeared  to be unarmed, and instantly got chased down by a few AI and got slaughtered.\n\nMy play time is low, cause the game looks unattartive, (bearly even close to finishing in two months, and seems like they just startted this a month ago)I really don't want to play this game because the developer seems to be a ♥♥♥♥ to everyone. I wouldn't want to play a game knowing the community is going to suck.\nPlease people, don't buy this game. Do not support people like him.\n\n..I want to add some more stuff c:\nThis game should be free to all players...or if they really need the money now, I would say this game is worth like less than $5.\nIts soooo awful, I can't describe it.  It feels like im playing some old ♥♥♥ game, made by some guy who half ♥♥♥♥♥ everything, or at least has beraly any experanice whats so ever when it comes to making games. I think he even stated he had no prior experanice before making this game. Just please guys, don't waset your money on this game.\n\nI did give the game another try, I join back in after quitting and as the game was loading it appeared I was getting killed by the AIs. And i was. This game just seems so poorly made. Some games don't need a tutorial, but this one does. Cause it looks so mediocre, there are no players anywhere, and when you hit pause its only suicide option and a quiting option. I have no idea how to play, can't ask anyone in game, cause no one plays the damn thing. Can't figure much out on my own cause it doesn't seem to be as simple as other games. I just don't enjoy this game whats so ever.\n(in b4 developer  rages in the comment section)\n\nP.S I heard they are trying to have another game green lighted on steam, and they BERALY even finish this one. They are just tyring to steal your money, and hide behind the "its an early acess game" they can't guarentee the game will look good at the end or even finish. Thats the whole point of early acess.\n\nMan all theses early acess games poping up is starting to get annoying. Lot people are just doing it to ♥♥♥♥♥ money. I remember a time when early betas were free because the whole point of early acess was to test out their game with a playerbase while still making the game. They would have some thigns like cash shops (good games only sell cosmetic stuff, no pay to win ♥♥♥♥) to support their game, but thats it.\nNow they are charging people money for an incomplete game that might not even survive.\n\nToo long didn't read? Well what I have to say is, game looks ugly, looks no where near finish product but they are going to magicly get this game finish in about two months, and the Developer team is very rude to their customers.( I got this game for free, and yet I'm still disappointeded. )","October 14, 2014","false","0.1"," 630 of 684 people (92%) found this review helpful 25 people found this review funny","92","630","684","25","36"

Clunky combat, pretty bad and somewhat unintuitive crafting system (more or less direct Rust copy) and cute attempts at creating "castle" themed building modules (walls, pillars, archways) instead of the standard shacks.

I would have understood it if this was still in early acess (and I mean EARLY, like alpha 0.00001) But SOMEHOW this is a "FULL" game. Yeah....Full of liquid cat ♥♥♥♥ with a sprinkle of burnt hair on top.... Sooooo many things bugged. I mean things that shouldent even BE bugs.\n\n- E button to interact with chests, Loot bags, Crafting tables/furnaces, ect. does NOT function UNLESS! you press esc two times after opening any of the UI menus, such as pressing I, B or, G.  then to close those menus press esc x2 or the E key will not work for whatever reason. Like this should NOT be a bug, come on now thats a major key to use in this "game".... -_-'\n\n-I couldent even wear any of the armour I crafted/bought... you can drag and drop it into the gear menu (G key), but as soon as you close out the gear menu, the helmet or what ever you placed is literally still FLOATING on your screen (WTF?!?).\n\n-NPC/Animals all drop the same loot, npc's can drop coins, Leather, Fine sand (cause that makes sence) cloth, and a seed bag and animals can drop meat leather/cloth and a seed bag.(not sure about the undead cause i never even saw one spawn....) Come on how about a little more variety.\n\n-HUNDEREDS of floating objects, trees, placed objects (tables, furnaces, camp fires) stones, npc's, animals, foundations, walls, the list goes on.\n\n-The forge never works...I've tried everything from putting wood and the ore in there, to just ore. I lit the fire first with the F key(suprising that worked unlike the E key, unless ya do what I said above to make it keep working). Maybe I'm doing something wrong with it, although it would not suprise me in the least if it just doesnt work.\n\n-You heal yourself faster than npc's/animals can attack you...yeah...\n\n-Why are there no friendly npc's?! what the hell! Although if I happened to see a naked man with a man-gina running around my village, it wouldent please me either <.<  On the subject of the NPCs, their AI is as good as the movie "AI" which was as entertaining as watching a turd in the grass on a hot summer day.\n\n-You literally have to be right up aginst the enemys to even hit them with your weapon, so you'll always be taking damage (not that it matters cause of the health regeneration speed...\n\n-The graphics are...well there okay...I guess... I can deal with them, but there just typical ol' unity style graphics, nothing special and I doubt any are custom and just imported in.\n\n- During the setup screen right when you click the launch button on steam you can set the controlls for the keyboard, except the E, B, and I keys, thats just... uhg...\n\n- Day and night transitions are about as smoth as "Castlevania Simons Quest" on the nes...\n\n- No single player...really....\n\nI could list probably 25+ more things wrong with this abomination but I feel I've gotten my point across...This game sucks clown balls, However! I could see improvement if the dev's actually gave a ♥♥♥♥ and realeased a HUGE update fixing...EVERYTHING. Ill still check on development once in awhile, but I really think this game should have NEVER left early acess untill it was stable in the first place...

While I'm not much into multiplayer games, that one surely not a "Massive Multiplayer" and hardly a game at all.\n\nMy experience: without any intro I've started in some forest, at the edge of the map and I've seen another edge of that map from my spawn point! Okay, I've managed through some very crooked interface to read a tutorial and equip a stick! With that stick I beat two bears, dozen of people who looked like villagers, and, above all, another dozen of heavily armored troops! Well, at first when I saw two grunts rushing at me, I was scared a bit, in real world or at least in some decent medieval game like Mount & Blade, I couldn't stand a chance against a soldier with halberd or sword and full plate, in plain shirt and with wooden club. But there I've succeeded! I even laughed a bit when I was kicking some elite guard, and two more spawned at my back!\n\nSeriously, you should not start this game. All the interactions in it are luggish, all you can do is running through some very crudely fabricated country-side, bashing everything what comes at you. Multiplayer part? Well, I've met two other people on the server, they were even more distracted than me. Yeah, there is a chat box, but what should we talk about? "WTF?" "Yeah, WTF are we doing here?"\n\nAction part is a major nail in the coffin. There was a time when all we had about medieval combat was Mount&Blade. Now we have some more decent approaches at this theme, some are good, some none, but only "Forsaken Uprising" is suggesting to click down every enemy with a single attack and without any application of any fencing skills.\n\nMaybe crafting part is slightly better than everything else in there, but to do crafting... you need to bash,bash,bash some mobs with your stick and hoping that glitches will allow you to get the loot after you beat some meat. Oh, I almost forgot to tell you: the loot is disappearing quite fast, so if you're fighting with two or more mobs, you'll probably take only the last one box. And that only if glitches will allow you to open that box! After I've opened about the dozen of chests, I suddenly realized I can't do it anymore! The chests just stopped to open to me! So I can't be sure about craft, I just can't get any ingridients.\n\nI must repeat: all the interface is buggy more than useful. Those devs surely needing a decent coder.\nMy mark is 4/10. 2 points for the effort, one for craft system and one for the road. Road to oblivion, where should go all developers who seling an alpha-build like a finished product, and expecting a good treating from the community. At least there are cards, so I can sell them and therefore get a refund.","September 7, 2015","false","8.2"," 200 of 218 people (92%) found this review helpful 54 people found this review funny","92","200","218","54","11"

It does have promise but it should have never been released in the state it is in right now.\n\nThere are three servers. Two of them are EU and one US. I have only gone on the US server. I didn't see anyone log on when I played; however, with the new updates I played less than hour and I only have about 5 hours total game play. Other players comments lead me to believe no one is really playing the game. What it comes down to is that there really isn't an active community.\n\nThe GUI isn't responsive and it is very hard to navigate through it. For example, when you start the game, you have to pick a server. When you select a server there is no response, but if you wait long enough the game will start. A lot of players will confuse this as lag or the game not working. There needs to be some kind of spinning wheel to let the player know that assets are loading or something.\n\nYou would be better off buying Rust, Rising World, The Forest, and etc. which are in the  same price range and will offer you the same type of game play.","December 25, 2014","false","5.2"," 139 of 152 people (91%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","91","139","152","8","0"

Well, I think that is no longer true: It's more like an early access game that still has a lot of rough edges. The developers are issuing rather frequent updates though so it is moving long.\n\nNormally I only rate an early access game "Recommended" if it's in a state were the core features are complete, most of the roughness is gone, and the issues that are left are more about how to improve (rather than fix the brokenness of) of game mechanics. (For example, Prison Architecht is an early access game in this state.) Forsaken Uprising is not quite at that level yet though so I'm not officially marking it "recommended" but I would consider it worth buying for those who are willing to deal with rough edges, are interested in this type of game, and want to help fund development.","August 31, 2014","false","2.7"," 158 of 192 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","158","192","0","9"

The developers are taking hostile actions against anyone that has criticisms or has negative feedback.) I feel my review below is as non-bias as I can get (based on what I just said above) Here goes:\n\n\nThe game just looks and feels sloppy. The combat is laughable. Dropping all items when you die does not make it "hardcore" it just makes it annoying and grindy.  Grind is a understatement when it comes to game play. You would be better off doing work at the fishing docks for pennies a hours.\n\nA lot of free codes were given out, this is most likely why. Scrap the entire system and start over, because that is what would be needed to make this game worth buying.

(Get it? Ha ha, it's a funny joke.)\n\nAs with the other Digital Homicide games on Steam, this would be another interesting idea if the developers would actually put effort into their games and not work on something game-jam worthy and full of $200 asset packs and release it on Steam. However, they don't, and they never do - they basically source everything from Unity Store asset packs, Google Images, and probably elsewhere. Read: they don't make any original content and resell (and steal!) the work of others.\n\nBut enough about Digital Homicide themselves, as if you already haven't been deterred from this game yet. Let's talk about the game itself, what this review is supposed to be about. Firstly, it's laggy as hell. It even shows in the trailer for the game! I mean, if you're going to make a game that lags so much, at least try to HIDE it somehow. The developer is straight out with it. Also, only two servers for the game exist, and they're both empty for the most part! When I play an MMO, I expect it to be a MMOG, not a MSOG (Massively Singleplayer Online Game). Finally, a lot of the buggy components from the infamous The Slaughtering Grounds can be found here: the unnecessary achievements, the glitchy pause menu, and the VERY simple inability to capture the mouse, just to name a few.\n\nAll I can say is that I can and have made better games than this in two weeks using mostly original content. That makes this load of bull-pucky extremely disappointing as a software developer myself.","July 16, 2015","false","3.4"," 31 of 34 people (91%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","91","31","34","11","0"

Well, this game, on all graphics settings, only operated at 15-30 FPS... [Note: I never even got up to 30].\n\nAlso, I'm not one to complain about graphics being bad, in fact I often hate when that's being focused on... but at the low quality this game's graphics are; it should not be so 'frame-laggy' as it is.\n\nOut side the visual sickening movement, the gameplay is... not well thought out.\n\nBasically you have to go into a menu (of any kind) to interact with the tutorial. To top it off, the tutorial is not something that actually teaches you much. Instead of being a step-by-step dialoge that would pop up for each step, it's just one giant string of 'next'.\n\nThere is no indication there's mobs around, I was in the starting area and got jumped by 2 wolves, which I could not defend against.\n\nOh, they use Minecraft esc style of inventory. The video/pictures you see on the store page are pretty misleading, in my opinion.\n\nI only spent 59 cents on this game, it was still a dollar more than I should have spent. (Yes, they should be paying people to play this game).\n\nSteam should honestly REMOVE this game from their library, I feel it's misleading.\n\nHONESTLY:\n\nThe game seems purposefully poorly designed.

How is this game bad? Let me count the ways.\n\nGraphics\nGraphics are atrocious even at "fantastic".\nText is near-illegible and blurry.Sound\nThere are farting noises for cows but they didn't bother to make mining stone sound different than chopping wood.\nNo music.UI\nUI is confusing.\nThe crosshair does not go away when you open interface windows.\nThe crafting categories are not immediately obvious for each item. Stone blocks and wooden boards are in "Component", but could feasibly be in "Construction". Tools like axes and pickaxes are in "Weapons" rather than a separate "Tools" category. Though this might just be nitpicking.\nMany inventory icons are unidentifiable. What is that thing? I dunno, let's hover over it and try to read the name in blurry text.\nYou can make UI windows smaller, but not bigger.Options\nInventory/crafting/activate/etc. keybinds are not customizable in-game or in the Unity popup.\nNo sound options.\nInterface options are ambiguous: does checking "Health bar" turn the bar on or off? (Checked is off.) Does checking "Quest window" turn it on or off? (Checked is on, but it's not checked by default when you open the game, so you have to check and uncheck to get rid of the window.)Gameplay\nCombat and crafting are slow and clunky.\nMovement is at a snail's pace.\nLimited number of spawn points, probably so you don't spawn in a rock.\nYou can't interact with the giant boulders and trees everywhere, you have to mine specific piles that emit red particles.\nIn-game tutorial is wrong and I had to read a Steam player-written guide to figure out how to use a campfire.\nThe Steam video is better than the game.\nSplitting stacks is (1) wrong in the tutorial (it says you hold control and left-click, but you actually have to right-click) and (2) clunky and non-customizable. It always splits the stack in half.\nDead enemies drop a chest. A ♥♥♥♥ing chest just drops on the ground. No carcass, just a wooden chest.\nBesides crafting being clunky, it is also completely non-interactive. You choose the amount to craft then click a button and wait, sometimes for a very long time.\nHow do I remove constructions? I dunno. I saw a bunch of half-finished houses lying around and swung my axe at them for a kick but nothing happened.\nYou can walk through trees. Just clip right through them.\nCan't interact with something? Maybe an invisible menu is open! I have to constantly press escape to bring up the menu and then escape again to get rid of it just so I can interact with things.\nI tried to pick up 140 wood that I accidentally dropped and it took me 30 seconds just to get in the right position and make sure that interacting with it worked (escape/escape like I said above).\nThe game basically freezes when loading a server. The first time I played it and clicked on a server, I had no idea what was going on for a bit and was tempted to just alt+F4. Then it loaded.\nYou can rotate castle foundations, but you can't rotate forges, campfires, offering pedestals, etc. for optimal appearance.\nI was able to continually mine resources just by opening my inventory when I still had my mouse button down.\nI met no one in my half-hour playtime even though I spawned in the first available spawn point.\nI had more fun writing this review than I did playing the game.","March 1","false","0.5"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","91","10","11","4","0"

Here my IMHO on Forsaken Uprising (full release).\n\nThere is no getting away from it, the graphics aren't going to blow you away even on highest settings. Grass for example will rotate, its hard to explain but if you remember DOOM items/dead humans/enemies would rotate to face you, even when you circled them dead. Well its the same for the grass in FU. Textures aren't up to much either, I'm also not sure what is unity bought assets from the developers own work? So on that point I can't comment on. When all is said and done, I can forgive graphics. It is after all a title that is currently £1.99 on the steam store down from £14.99 if memory serves.\n\nThe crafting in Forsaken Uprising, seems the main highlight as there are many items you'll be busy crafting. Not sure on why ground logs and rocks with red glow is the only collectible resources and not standing trees nor rock faces. One corner stone in survival crafting games is how it deals with protecting your hard earned resources, I'll touch on building later but 'hinges' a item for making doors, is a process that requires so many loops to jump through. Doors on the buildings are to my knowledge the only way to hold off new spawn players helping themselves to what is in chests,fires, forges and boxes.\n\nBuilding a base in which to enjoy and progress through the crafting levels should be a joy. Pillars, floors, walls and roofs are easy to craft but placement can be tricky as walls for example can only face one way and need rotating to stay in place. I needed to jump out of the game 3 times in which to find out, that walls can only be placed one way.\n\nNPCs and combat; Combat is without a doubt the weak link, its like hitting thin air as the npcs just continue their animation attack regardless. Npcs are lifeless and will jump into action only when you get close. All act like you've slept with their wifes and will attack and give chase.\n\nBugs are what kills the title in the end, it plays very much like a alpha build should not be full release. Killed NPCs dropped chests that will not open most of the time, chests, boxes, fires in fact any item that players work with will and will not open. I can't count the times I had to jump up and down to get a box to open. Food will disappear on fires, items will disappear.\n\nIts ultimately the bugs that will put you off playing, its makes the title not fun at all. In all my 4hrs time I've only been aware of one other player on the server, its been a solo exp for 95% of my time. Lastly I will comment on Digital Homicide normally I wouldn't be reviewing the developers other then on how active they are in a EA game, but it is well documented. The Youtube PR fall out would in my view have magnified the issues present in Forsaken Uprising dooming the title to one to avoid. The game isn't great but its not the worst I have downloaded on my PC. My advice to DH would to firstly fix the bugs, 2nd place a system to protect players items or doors as easy crafted as walls etc and work on the combat system.","May 31, 2015","false","4.1"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

Graphics are comparable to PS2 era games, yet I cannot get a stable framerate at all. Seriously, Supra Mayro Kratt runs better then this and thats a real POS. The gameplay from what I can tell from the hour or so of playing it is broken. You can beat down fully armoured knights with your club and in the rare event that you do die, you can simply return to the spot where you died  and keep going at him. If you kill a bear, it magically drops a chest about 2x it's size in its place, presumably to quicken development time by removing the need to model all of the bears drops.\n\nOh did I mention that you don't lose items on death? Not to mention the "forest" (if you can call it that) is littered with forges and campfires. Seriously, it looks like complete trash.\n\nThe multiplayer bit? None. I never saw one person, nor did I even know if there WAS someone because of the horrendous UI and the terrible models.\n\nIf you're looking to buy this because it's often ~90% off. Don't. There is a good reason it is so cheap. Buy sometime else, like 4 copies of Orion Prelude for example. Or even just buy a can of coke or a Mcdonalds burger, both will net you more enjoyment then this game.\n\n1.2/10 Would never recommend to anyone, not even my enemies.","February 3","false","4.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","5","5","2","0"

I killed a skeleton and he dropped some coins and some cloth, and now Im starting to think that I own everyones property, because everything I kill now drops no loot, and none of the lootable containers are lootable. Also why do I hear randomly hear someone ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ themselves? The only visually appealing thing about this game is the rocks, they look kind of nice. I'm fairly sure most of the village buildings have no entrances. Im not surprised there was only 1 other person on the server with me, not to mention there are only 2 servers.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Iantagonist/recommended/314700/","Iantagonist","Iantagonist","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Iantagonist/","259 products in account","Let's start off with the settings of this wonderful MMO. There virtually are no settings except for the graphics, and lag is almost guaranteed no matter which graphic option you choose. With my computer that can run Unity games in the highest resolution and quality fine, the fact that this still lags in the "Fastest" quality is baffling.\n\nNow let's talk about the battle system. It is constant left clicking and nothing else. Enemies go through you sometimes, and your health recovers if you jump back for no explained reason. Stamina, Sustenance, and Strength, three components of the game never deplete. Jumping and attacking uses stamina, yet stamina will recover while you're jumping for some reason and go down while you're walking. Why? Beats me.\n\nThe crafting in this game works - sometimes. During certain times of the day, looting enemies, crafting, and collecting materials DOESN'T EVEN WORK in the game. When crafting does work, it's not even worth it. You'll just wonder why you made these weapons if you're just going to have issues with them anyway. Sometimes the sound effects from the weapons completely disappear for no reason.\n\nSpeaking of sound effects, the music in the title screen sounds pretty epic. Afterwards, there is no music. Just cricket sound effects and birds. The sound effects themselves are horrid; the weapon sound effects sound straight out of 1997, and the dying sound effect is the most annoying and horrifying gurgling sound I have ever heard. You'll probably hear this sound because you were randomly attacked by an animal, a villager, or an out-of-place knight. Seriously, they fight you unprovoked and without reason.\n\nOverall, this game makes me cry. There is a lot of space in the game and many crafting capabilities, but it doesn't matter when the game is completely broken and tedious. There's never anyone online, and I think it's better that way. This is the ONLY MMO that might actually be worse with multiple people, because that would probably multiply the problems. What kind of an MMO is that? Don't play this game unless you hate yourself, or you got it for free or extremely cheap (I got it for 59 cents) to mock it or see how bad it is. You might want to do it with a couple of friends though, or you might go insane like me.\n","July 25, 2015","false","2.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","1"

However, the game is quite laggy on a machine than can run Rust at 60 fps, and overall, the game suffers from a lack of content BUT there is some promising material here, so if the developers worked quite hard on some of the concepts that don't quite work and, preferably, on the fact that the game needs to be better optimized. If it had some more content (that worked well, in theory) it could turn into an interesting multiplayer game - but with nobody playing, and the inability to die, I dont see the value in playing it solo. 3/10","June 5, 2015","false","1.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I know the game was only 59 cents but even with the price as low as it was, this game wouldn't be worth it, even if it was free! This is the must buggiest game I have ever played. Once you start playing there are bugs left and right. I spent over an hour trying to figure out how the  their stupid crafting worked. When I want to build a castle like they show in the preview, it shows it working perfectly. When I tried building a castle I couldn't even put a foundation down because the foundation, or the ground was bugged. One of the main controls like a lot of survival games was "e". E was supposed to be used to activate and used to grab things. Well, let me tell you something. Every once and a blue moon would "e" work at all! When you kill animals, they drop loot (killed more than 20) and every time I wanted to see the loot, I would press "e" and you know what happened? Nothing! Absolutely Nothing! Also the game is very laggy. I mean come on? How is there lag when NO one is on playing when this game sucks!!!!!??? If you have played a survival game called The Forest, you know it can be very laggy, and buggy. This game made The Forest look like it was a fully completed, perfect game. Seriously I have played similar games for FREE and they have been better. I also forgot to mention that this game is such a Rust clone! Almost everything, the character models, graphics, game play, icons for items, as well as the same concept. Like I said before, the worst game ever!!!!!! I hope whoever looks at this game doesn't get screwed over and buys it.

I WILL PERSONALLY HAVE A FIRING SQUAD SENT TO ANYONE THAT BUYS THIS! WHY? BECAUSE EVRYONE IGNORES THE REVIEWS ON STEAM "MOSTLY NEGATIVE!" THAT SHOULD TELL YOU THAAT THIS IS AN AWFUL GAME! YOU SHOULD ALSO TAKE NOTE THAT THIS IS A DIGITAL HOMICIDE GAME! THAT SHOULD ALSSO SAY SOMETHING TO YOU!\n\nNow this is another hidden sh*t by digital homicide, developers of the slaughtering grounds. this was released after the slaughtering grounds but was put in development before it. If anyone is confused by this basically this was released in early access  first then they released the 'completed product' of the slaughtering grounds and then they released the 'complete' forsaken uprising. This is an MMO.... wait what? It should be common knowledge that a small development team does not release an mmo as their first game and then put it up on steam and charge people for it. I'll give the guys at digital homicide props as this is impressive as a first mmo and as a first game by the company but that is still not an excuse to release a game with this many flaws.\n\nFirstly ,like other digital homicde games, they havn't made one unique thing in this game. All of the stuff in this game are from the unity asset store.\n\nFor example here is the bear from forsaken uprising https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/4982\n\nThat means that they've basically payed someone else to do all the hard work for them while digital homicide just threw  all of this into a blender and the blender came out with forsaken uprising. It took me forever to figure out what I was even doing, it wasn't until about 20 mins in I noticed that I had a club in my inventory.\n\nThe game dosn't have a tutorial because digital homicide want to personally torture me. When I started hitiing a tree with a club nothing happened because again there was no tutorial system to tell me where to get wood. I should tell you now so the rest of the review makes sense in the server (out of the two that could be chosen) there were 6 other people in the server and they were kind enough to give me a tutorial of how to play the game WHICH THE DEVS SHOULD HAVE DONE!  They told me that instead of hitting the tree stumps that were all around me I neded to hit the already cut down lumber thaat were in only certain areas of the world. I HIT ALREADY CUT DOWN LUMBER THAT ARE ON THE GROUND? IT WOULD MAKE MUCH MORE SENSE FOR ME TO HIT THE TREES, BUT NO I NEED TO SCOWER THE WORLD AND FIND CUT DOWN LUMBER. I'm glad these guys were in the server to help me. I WOULD HAVE NO IDEA WHAT TO DO IF THESE GUYS WEREN'T IN I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW THEY FIGURED OUT HOW TO PLAY THIS GAME!\n\nThey then introduced me to the combat. get this there's no need for combat. ur health regenrates way to quickly for you to even die in combat. THEY CANT CODE THE COMBAT CORRECLTY THE WHOLE POINT OF A SURVIVAL GAME IS THE TASK TO SURVIVE BUT IN FORSAKEN UPRISING THERE IS NO SURVIVAL TASK! U CANT DIE UNLESS THERES 5 THINGS ATTCKING YOU AT ONCE. also when you kill something in the gaame they drop a chest. YES THEY DROP A CHEST EVEN THE ANIMALS THEY DROP CHESTS AS LOOT. another thing that I notice aout other games that I canloot things from is that I find the animals carrying the weirdest things. I t carries on in this as I found a pig carrying wood. THE PIG MUST KNOW MORE ABOUT THE GAME THAN I DO HE WAS SMART ENOUGH TO CHOP AT THE LUMBER.\n\nI reached the edge of the map and the devs don't put an invisble wall or anything the world just stops no invisible wall YOU CAN LITERALLY WALK OF THE SIDE OF THE MAP AND DIE. I gave up on the game at that point and I went back to it and guess what the game didn't work. Thee game crashed when i tried to load up the only server listed. I'll give it a final verdict\n\nPros\n+A good setup\n+A good first mmo attempt\n\nCons\n-gets boring real quickly\n-Boring and useless combat\n-Barely any players\n-Bad crafting interface\n-Bad graphics\n-Awfully textured animals\n\nVerdict: 2/10\n\nSteam Curator group: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/MellowReviews","October 23, 2015","false","4.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","57","4","7","3","0"

Naked man 1, big bad bear 0. The bear turned into a box, and in the box i found meat, leahter, a pouch of seeds and a new club, i had to find a fire to cook the meat. After walking in the woods for some minutes i met "Rastafunken el barbro" as he was lagging away, i walked up to him, told him he looked like a stone, all gray.. than we agreed that the game sucked, and i asked him to put me out of my misery, he killed me, and i exited the game never to return.\n\n- The game was not worth my 0.60 euros\n\n- Got a card drop that i sold for 0.15 euros, if you play long enough and bought the game on sale, you can sell all the carddrops, so you basiclly got the game for free.

(if you aren't willing to)\n\ni love these styles of games , im not dissapointed but you cant play when you\n1. dont know how\n2. are the only player in the world online due to bad reviews\n3. there are minor bugs stopping the game being playable. and could be sooooo easy fixed\n\n\nHONESTLY DEV TEAM .

Bottom line, if you fix the graphics rendering so it's not trying to render the whole universe in one shot, lower the range add "fog of war" and allow players to tweak such settings... might help out a ton.

As I explored my inventory, I found a club! I quickly equipped it, and just in time too!!\n\nSome strange naked (sexless as this is a pg game) man had appeared behind me, so I promptly hit him in the head with my club. Then I ran down the hill to visit the village I found. On the way, I happened to notice I too was naked. So I was hopeful that this nice village would offer me some cloths and an idea on what to do next.\n\nI was approached by a NPC knight, who tried to kill me?!?! Talk about unreasonable, not to let a naked club wielding person into your village. Talk about rude, so I ran past him and further in, hoping to find a helpful hand. But I was met with attacks instead. Everyone in the village was now chasing this naked club holding guy around. I tried to lose them by running around a cow, but it wasn't enough to get away.\n\n10/10 will streak through village again!\n\nNow for the real review. The game is fun and very easy to pickup and figure out without having to deal with 15 minutes plus of boring tutorials.\n\nBeyond that, this game has some great ideas going on here. Build your own castle, make siege equipment, and lay waste to your neighbor's place. There are quests, to do beyond just building. Plus blue prints to unlock for stronger equipment.\n\nAll I can say, is remember, this isn't a finished game, there will be bugs, but if you want to help support a game that is well worth it, and you're ready to have fun, even with bugs, then this game is for you!","November 19, 2014","true","6.3"," 29 of 134 people (22%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","22","29","134","17","0"

When I was playing, there was only a few people and I never saw them.  I got my buddy to get the game, we could never find eachother, no real way to tell who anyone is.\n\nI feel like the core concept is great, but it's execusion is terrible.  Go play some real medieval games before you try to make a medieval combat system, there is no skill in the melee, and the archy sucks but it makes it mildly worth it.\n\nI would say get the game if you are bored with all your other games like me, and see if it picks up and improves.\n\nFix the item duping asap too, because I was able to duplicate almost anything.\n\nNice try but you should seriously add some skill to the combat.","August 14, 2014","true","2.5"," 66 of 247 people (27%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","27","66","247","7","4"

It deff has some bugs but its alpha and I'm sure they will be worked out, I've noticed the controls seem to be a little different when it comes to moving items in and out of your inventory and into a campfire/forge so at first that is a little frustrating but once you get use to the way it wants you to do that kind of stuff the game pops out and shines in its own ways.\n\nOne way this game differentiates it self from the other build / craft / survival games is its point system for learning new blueprints, it gives you quests you must complete for more points in order for you to gain the skills that you need to craft better stuff!\n\nIn my encounters I have only found one person that was not friendly, so that's kind of a plus if your coming from a game like rust ware a guy with a rifle will kill you for your epic loot consisting of a rock and some wood.\n\nIn short, this is already a game you can get your moneys worth out of especially if you get it on sale like it is right now for $11. Don't get frustrated right away if your having trouble moving things around in you inventory because once you get the hang of it, its well worth it!\n\nThanks Dev's and i look forward to the future of this game!","October 31, 2014","true","20.5"," 24 of 128 people (19%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","19","24","128","0","3"

It is enjoyable and actually can be quite addictive. My issue is I'm working on my master's degree so I  rarely get to play.  It would be nice to see more people but the lack of population gives me time to build up my castle and such before it gets too popular and I get attacked all of the time.\n\nA few neat things about the game - for one, the long list of items to make and outfit yourself with. I love being able to design and build my own castle as well as fortify it! And the maps are large so it was easy to find a place to place the castle. You can even place it in an area where it overlooks the ocean and there are beautiful sunsets.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Seranth/recommended/314700/","Seranth","Seranth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Seranth/","1189 products in account","It's really just yet another survival game in development. Graphics are like Morrowind. Engine is Unity (so very few game options available). You progress by collecting resources to make the recipes. There doesn't seem to be any permanence because when I logged in, the server was going to reset in 3 days (maybe it resets weekly?).\n\nI've went through the tutorial and it hasn't been accurate a few times. For example, it says you split a stack by ctrl+left click, but it only worked with ctrl+right click (my bindings are all default). Also, it doesn't say you need to press 'f' to start the campfire so I was stuck there watching nothing happen until I went to read a steam guide.\n\nIt's not a very well polished game. I wanted to use a windowed mode 4:3 resolution but 800x600 had things overlap and/or unreadable/cut off. I had several FPS drops. There's sudden changes in the lighting/sky when the time passes. It'll be blue skies one moment, then sunset the next. Lakes seem to be pure reflections of the sky (instead of water) and you die if you go into it.\n\nYour health regens very quickly so it usually takes a pack of enemies to kill you (at least when starting out). You can afk with one mob attacking and be fine. Armed with only a club, I could easily take out the armored NPCs hanging around camps. Enemies don't seem to have a leash range so it seems like you can make a train of them follow you to the ends of the earth. And when you die the enemies keep attacking you until you respawn so your health bar goes far into the negatives. There doesn't seem to be a penalty for death (I kept my items).\n\nThere is a objective system but the 3 objectives shown were to kill 10 animals, 5 greenskin NPCs (goblins? haven't seen them), or 5 undead NPCs. They each had a time limit and if you fail it just restarts the timer. I'm not sure what happens if you complete them.\n\nI had the most fun letting enemies chase me and trying to collect as many types as possible. I started with a couple bears and a warthog, went to the northeast quadrant and picked up some undead and wolves, travelled to the northwest quadrant and couldn't find anything, then died because I took a phone call and stopped moving for a second too long. If you want to try this, watch out for the ferns and trees: you can run through them but the enemies have to route around them. If you get too far ahead they'll run back home. My sustenance bar never got low enough to find out what happens when you run out (and stamina/strength seem mostly pointless, though they decrease when you run or attack too much).\n\nI was going to say that the server was empty but apparently one guy typed in chat while I was writing this.\n\nI couldn't recommend the game in its current state, there has to be another survival that can give you a similar or better experience. Everything is a work-in-progress but at least the developer hasn't given up on updates yet. It was more fun for me playing to mess with the engine (mob trains, AI, etc.) than to actually grind the resources and do the recipes. Maybe a try if you're the type of person who wants to mess around in an unbalanced and somewhat buggy/incomplete game.\n\n---\n\nEdit: Today when I logged in the screen was mostly black and I couldn't see more than the UI. Relaunched several times and it finally worked after I changed resolution. There also seem to be some inventory/crafting bugs where items randomly disappear when moving them or aren't crafted. It was pretty annoying because it doesn't refund your materials. There's another bug where I couldn't gather any more wood until I respawned. And sometimes you can't open chests/pick up items.\n\nOn a similar note, it also allows you to 'craft' when you don't have the required materials, so you are just watching a progress bar do nothing. In addition, the inventory doesn't let you stack more than 200 wood/stone. However, if you try to create a stack of exactly 200 it will roll over and you'll end up with 1. (For example, combine 192 stone with 8 stone and you end up with one stack of 1 stone). And if move an item onto a slot that is about to receive an item (for example: if you're mining stone in the background while checking your inventory) then the item you're moving will disappear.\n\nAlso, I forgot to mention that (at least in windowed mode) your mouse isn't captured by the game when you check your inventory or alt-tab. And recaptured when you exit inventory. If you find you can't attack/place items and it shows a mouse cursor, you probably need to open and close your inventory to attack. You can also take advantage of this: if you hold your mouse button while opening the inventory, you'll keep attacking until you close the inventory and retake control of the mouse.\n\nThe AI/health regen in this game allows you to easily kite mobs. If you want to grind the quests (which give 50 divinity each- divinity unlocks more crafting recipes) then walk in the middle of a fort/settlement and then move in a circle around them while attacking. I held s+d (to move back and to the right) while attacking and moving my mouse slightly to the left. Eventually they'll die and if you do it properly there shouldn't be any danger unless you get stuck on something.\n\nDeath animations are pretty funny because most of the time there is no animation (the model suddenly hovers above the ground in a standing position then the model lowers to the ground where a chest appears.) However, for some deaths it allowed you to hit them as they were hovering and they'll ragdoll backwards before disappearing.","August 5, 2015","false","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
