Labcoat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LtLabcoat/","1680 products in account","Basically the best turn-based strategy game there is. Except possibly XCOM. That's no exaggeration, this is easily one of my top five games ever!\nAs a single-player game, it's better than the other Massive Assault games, but it doesn't have multiplayer. There's a separate game for that.\n\n\nI'll compare it to two games here:\nAdvance Wars is a turn-based military strategy game. You build units, you attack with them one at a time, and you try capture cities so that you can build more units.\nHearthstone is a turn-based card game. It's selling point is that every turn is a maths-based puzzle, trying to work out the most effective way to attack.\nMassive Assault combines the two. It's a turn-based strategy game with no probabilities and simple figures, so it's possible to work out how a turn will go as soon as you start it. And that's just the START of why it's brilliantly designed!\n\nOh, and it has undos. Because there's no probabilities or unknowns, you can redo everything up to the start of your turn. Which is excellent!\n\n\nThe big downside is the story and voice acting. The story is just another excuse plot, but at least it's not the main focus, and the voice acting.... oh, it's hilariously bad! Seriously, you haven't lived until you've seen a former soviet try to do an Italian accent!\nFor the record, at the time it was behind in terms of graphics and sound too. Sound effects, the music is still great. But, like Mischief Makers, now it just looks like a regular old game. Which is good!","January 22, 2013","true","81.0"," 22 of 22 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","22","22","0","0"

I owned the disk version for years and picked it up on steam just to have it with most of my other games.","December 26, 2014","true","3.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

This has completely ruined it for me, and nowhere does it say parts of the game have been taken out. A quick search on google also seems to show they've taken out hot seat on the original massive assault. Although this is a good game, it's not worth the price if it's only for single player.","September 6, 2014","false","4.5"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"
