The reason I say that is because I feel that you’re either going to love this game or hate it.  Personally, I could not get into it.  I restarted the game about 12 different times, each time seeing if I had ‘missed’ something or simply didn’t understand the concept.  However, even after 12 times, I continued to scratch my head – wondering about the many facets of this game.\n\nI really loved the music, it does a great job driving-home the ‘futuristic’ vibe of the game.  I also love the ‘mechanics’ to the game.  You progressively get better at skills in the game by doing them – don’t like your terrible aim with that rifle, then keep shooting at things (all the things!).  I also noticed that the game included skills such as ‘mining’ and ‘stealing,’ which is awesome!\n\nThough, I believe what ruined this game for me was the story and setting; I think that’s what made me restart the game so times, too.  The, seemingly, inconsistent size of the NPCs, the strange location of buildings (yes, I realize it’s a randomly generated world, but there needs to be some consistency for an RPG), and the way items are distributed to the player (randomly generated on the ground, just sitting there or sold by a vendor – very inconsistent).  I tried to discover the reason, but it didn’t appear to be laid out anywhere obvious to the player, no in-game ‘books’ to discover with clues, no conversation with NPCs to help get answers.  The world needs to be 'plausible,' (not to be confused with possible) and the developer has not achieved that.\n\nI feel that a video game has the same mark that books, movies, and television bear – these outlets have a very small window of opportunity to grab their audience, if they miss that window it’s gone.  For me, ‘3079 – Block Action RPG’ missed that opportunity, and I really wish it hadn’t.","November 27, 2013","false","1.1"," 234 of 345 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","234","345","0","6"

Ultimately, there is enough of a cool game here for me to keep putting time into it.\n\nThe games name is strange, don't worry about it.  Here's what jumps out:  Action RPG.  The game is an FPS action rpg.  It looks like an ASCII Minecraft, but has all the ARPG symptoms.\n\nXP grind?  ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ RIGHT SON.  Your skills increase as you use them.  Pick some pockets dawg, raise that stat.\n\nLoot? Yo, the big guy over there wielding a sword with fangs that one shotted the NPC from your faction?  You take his life, you take his blade.\n\n"... But Proto, this dudes sword SUCKS BALLS dewd!"  Yeah, it happens.  But you can sell that piece in almost any area.  Items scale with the enemies, who scale with the zone.  You're in a level 9 zone, the level 9 enemies drop level 9 ♥♥♥♥ that usually be sellin' for a pretty penny even when they are booty butter.  This is awesome because....\n\nThere's mad cool ♥♥♥♥ to loot in this game!  This is my favorite part:  your character can equip jet packs and grappling hooks that give you crazzzzzzzzy mobility.  You can fly into sky fortresses, or zip around the landscape with non-stop grapple shots.  Thing is, though, these ♥♥♥♥♥es also scale.  Level 1 hooks/packs can be used when holding 40 weight, no more.  Every level adds an additional 40 lbs.   It's cool zipping into a high level zone, on a mad hunt for the shopkeeper or drop zone with the clutch twink grappling hook/jet pack.  You have to get out alive too, because when you die you lose an item.  The game is sadistic, it will eliminate the item you hold most dear.\n\nI suppose I wish the game felt more complete.  I've put some goodly time into it and I'm not sure if there is anything else to do but loot grind.  The building mechanic?  No idea what's going on there.  Completely arbitrary, in my experience.\n\nHowever, I have to say that I haven't got many quests done in the *main* story line.  There's a little bit of RNG involved with quest givers having to give you a specific reward to advance - it can get a little frustrating.   Hunting for the right people always devolved into loot grinding and murdering things.  This was really fun for a bit, and I'll probably sit down a few more times to see just deep the game goes, but it becomes nothing more than pure carrot-sticking.   Still hours of fun.\n\n6.9/10\n\n","December 2, 2013","true","12.1"," 41 of 49 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","41","49","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RexTheTyrant/recommended/259620/","RexTheTyrant","Tyrant Rex","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RexTheTyrant/","56 products in account","I got this game when it was in Alpha from Indie Royale. Please keep in mind that this game is made by one person and is only a few dollars. So let's get to the pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n1. Nice difficulty curve - the farther you get away from the starting town that harder the enemies get, and the greater the loot gets. After you get some pretty good gear you upgrade yourself to fighting demons instead of Neanders (I think that's how you spell it).\n2. Cards - They don't typically sell for much, but hey; buy a cheap game, get a few hours of gameplay and some free cards.\n\nCons:\n1. Lack of random encounters - sometimes you may see a spaceship. You can damage them, but I have never been strong enough to destroy it before it kills me. Other than that, it's just more of the same old enemies over and over.\n2. Uninteresting quests - There are only like, 4 quests possible to take; Protect this herp, destroy that derp, kill that guy, hack this computer. That's literally all the quests I have ever seen, and with as many hours as I have on record, you would expect a bit more.\n\nOther comparisons:\n1. Weapon types - if you want variety, you will be disappointed as there are very few weapon types. Sniper rifle, Pistol, Grenade launcher, Shotgun, Sword, and Demon sword (which is only for demons) are the only ones I can think of. Although you can install upgrade circuits into your weapons and armor to upgrade characteristics that apply to you character, which is actually kind of cool.\n2. You better not ever accidentally shoot one of your own people, 'cuz if you do they all gunna keel you (It's pretty unforgiving). This can be fun though If you ever get bored you can always turn on your own kind and start stealing from people and become a nomad, so there's that (PS if you do this, there's no going back).\n\nThat's about it. Not a very big game, but if you buy it on sale, it's not too much and you'll have some fun. SO, expect that, a few hours of entertainment and some cards.","December 23, 2014","true","18.9"," 27 of 30 people (90%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","90","27","30","3","0"

Not only does the world feel organic and full of dangers, but there's solid gameplay utilizing the best parts of both the building of Minecraft and item-searching in dungeon-diving of rogue-likes.\n\nAlso, it looks good 'n artsy. None of that Minecraft monotone but rather some creepy and original style to it. Randmization really makes stuff interesting in this game. There's definitely lots to see, meet and explore.\n\nAs to the difficulty, it's the game's strong point. This world is relentless and does need you to take it seriously.

I was attracted to this game due to the Steam Reviews, which seemed to indicate a very unique game, with lots of replayability and exploration. I have played this game for about 4-5 hours, not the 7 minutes reported, due to the game not reporting to the Steam Client as it opens up in a Java window....\n\nUnfortunately, my experience has not been very good. Initially, the game would not run, and required 2-3 reinstallations from Steam to ensure it would open as expected. Once in the game, there is not a lot in the ways of a fluid or organic flow to the game. You sort of just walk around, hoping to figure out things as you go before you die. The monsters are not that exciting to look at, and the animations are very poor. I have attempted to play with a friend, and even then, the game was not any clearer.\n\nI would describe this game as a cult-classic type favorite, where you either LOVE the game, or you HATE/DON'T UNDERSTAND the game. Unfortunately for the developer, I easily fall into the "Don't Understand", and "Don't Like" side. Since the game is cheap I find it hard to give a bad review, but this game unfortunately goes into my 'Pile of Shame'.\n\nTLDR; not a great game, not well developed. very cult-like following, but was not able to enjoy.","August 21, 2014","false","0.1"," 42 of 68 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","42","68","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/recommended/259620/","somebody336","somebody336","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/","2760 products in account","3079 is an Open World FPS set on an alien planet where you are sent in to stop a never ending war between two species. At least that's what you’re told to do but upon landing you instantly pick a side of the conflict and work as a mercenary for hire. The species friendly to you at the beginning are the humanoid looking aliens but you can switch sides by killing enough of them to please the other side. It may seem like a good idea to immediately head out of the city and hunt some aliens but as you will soon find out they are soldiers that only know war while you on the other hand are the space equivalent of some random dude running off to the battlefield with a Nerf gun. You will immediately realize how useless you are at fighting at the beginning and it is an important lesson to learn since dying means losing a random item. I say random but most of the times they seem to take away your grappling hook or your most used weapon.\n\nIt is a really rough introduction to the game and even if you manage to knick a weapon off of an enemy killed by someone else you will not be able to use it. There is no ammo in this game, instead everything relies on your energy meter and the more powerful a weapon is, the more it uses. At first you may as well be carrying a broken gun as you will not be able to fire off a single round without it overdrawing your energy and harming your health. This game features skills like stealth, energy and charisma to name a few, which get more effective as you use them in a certain manner. Unfortunately the way to improve them are usually insanely tedious. You'd think that by using energy its stat will go up but the way it works in this game is that by using more energy than you have and harming your own health it will eventually increase. Since in the beginning you can barely fire off any rounds at all that means you will spend most of your early adventures staring at a wall and repeatedly firing just to get your energy up. Enemies regenerate health so by the time you have enough to fire again they will be mostly healed meaning you must use the better weapons with heavy energy usage.\n\nHonestly, this energy thing is what harms the game the most and will be a problem for the entire game as you need more and more energy. Stealing is pure RNG and requires you to get caught in order to increase its stats while being hit when you are camouflaged makes you better at Stealth. The progression system is a complete, nonsensical mess sadly and by that logic I'll become a mathematician by failing my math tests. Seems like a petty thing to complain about it but it is honestly no fun and means you only get better by either doing tedious things or getting shot in the face. The only thing you really get for killing enemies is their weapons to sell to a vendor later on. Vendors are the same as any other alien but with a ”$” symbol on their shirt. You could buy useful objects from them like grappling hooks, armor or generators that increase your stats while active. These generators can have some rather cool effects such as increasing your jump height enough to be able to jump houses and walls which makes you feel pretty awesome as you take down several enemies midair.\n\nYou can tell any none busy ally to follow you around and gather up your own posse to hunt down the enemy if you so please. It is a really handy feature, especially early in the game when you are pathetically weak. The AI is not all that great so they are only useful in open fields, don't expect to be rescued while in buildings. AI is embarrassingly bad for the spacecraft that fight like if you had a giant magnet to your face and will stick right on you until one of you is dead. You can attempt to hijack which is a pretty cool feature and lets you zoom around the skies though it is rather weak and likely to get you killed if used in a fight. It's also a bad idea to go too far out as the further you go the stronger the enemies are. Along with the two species at war there are also demons that look like red gummy bears out to kill everything. These are a very annoying as they will pull you in near them no matter the distance between you two. They are not rare and it is not unusual that you have to fight with the controls just to escape their gravitational pull any time you want to go somewhere.\n\nDemons can only be killed by a very specific kind of sword which brings me with another issue. You can only equip 4 weapons or items to the hot-keys at any one time. The rest of your number keys are useless and you will always want to have the demon sword and grappling hook equipped so you only have two hotkeys to work with. This adds completely unnecessary micromanagement whenever you need something else like a satchel charge, your drill or your construction tool. You can mine the randomly generated world for gems though they offer very little money compared to simply scavenging guns from a battlefield. This game does feature destructible environments but only with the satchel charge unfortunately. Building your own base is possible but ultimately pointless as the point of the game is to move further and further out into the map while staying in a low level area is useless.\n\nGrappling hooks in this game are a ton of fun to use and have a pretty long range making you feel like a mix of Spider Man and Rambo as you quickly navigate the environments. There is an anti-gravity device that allows you to float around at the cost of not being able to recharge your energy. It is really useful for reaching the floating buildings and did lead to an insanely awesome moment where I was near death & surrounded at the edge of a cliff, jumped off and managed to activate it a few feet from the ground. 3079 does have its moments and incredible potential but seems to sabotage itself at every turn. Like the previously mentioned grappling hooks an anti-gravity device can only support a certain amount of weight from your inventory. It sounds reasonable enough but as you head to a higher level area which happens quite often, everything starts weighing more and more. That's not anything unusual in video games but it feels so artificial here where even the health packs start weight over 30 pounds. One area will have a grappling being sold with up to 400lbs usability and the next one will have one with 440lbs. You don't think “Wow, I can carry more now!” instead you're feel the need to facepalm as everything suddenly gets heavier in order to make your gear obsolete  time and time again.\n\nYou receive missions from allies with stars on their chest but they are rarely worth the price. There are main missions that revolve around the fight against demons and you will need to do at least one of those to get yourself a demon slaying sword. At the end of the day 3079 implements a ton of ideas into one package but fails to make the overall product fun. As an example you turn on your night vision and grapple onto the top of a tall tree with a sniper rifle to take down some enemies. Multiple things keep this from being fun. For one your night vision goggles only pick up enemies of a certain level so you will have to keep buying new ones every time you enter another area until you can't be bothered. Second your sniper uses up a ton more energy while using the scope yet has no added damage, so you may as well use it without the scope which defeats the purpose of a sniper. And finally, it is not unlikely there will be a demon in sight that will cause you to fight with the controls just to keep your footing in the tree even if it is far away and unaware of you. 3079 has a ton of ideas and a ton of heart no doubt but I'm afraid its progression system, annoying mechanics and combat heavily hampered by energy make this a game I simply can't recommend.","April 25","false","20.9"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","1"

There is not much to tell about the story, you were dropped on this planet to investigate life, and wound up left there to fight for your life.\nI strongly recommend you go through a guide first because the game doesn't explain much at the start, nor throughout the game.\n\nThere are two 'races' in this game called the Humoids and Neanders, you start friendly with Humoids, but can become an ally with the Neander race if you start killing Humoids. There is also a third race aka the Demons, which are enemies to both races and can only be beaten using a demon smiters, which can be obtained by doing quests for leaders (they have stars on their body). So at the start of the game you might wanna avoid those guys, because you will die...a lot.\n\nEnemies drop loot which you can sell for money (to merchants, they have $ sign on them) and buy better weapons for yourself. Best features of this game are a grappling hook, which is used the same way as in Just Cause, and an Antigrav pack, which lets you float around so you can avoid terrain obstacles. But both of those have weight limits and cannot be used after you pass the said limit.\n\nWeapons are plentiful and everyone will find something they will stick to, from quick blasters, to shotguns and rocket launchers. There are also mini fighters in the game that you will use to bring down the big ships, but I found them a bit too slow for my taste.\nAs you fight you level up and increase your stats: Strength - carrying more items, Stamina - health, Firearms - weapon damage and Energy - used up for shooting, represents ammo capacity in the game). Skills you can develop include: Mining - getting gems to sell, Charisma - more likely for NPC's to follow you around, Engineering - efficiency of upgrading armor or waepons, Stealing - pretty obvious).\n\nAnd one thing that annoyed me a lot is that every time you die you lose 1 random item from your inventory (so you can lose that awesome gun you just bought in a split second)\nSo to sum it all up:\n\n+ satisfying shooting\n+ grappling hook and antigrav pack\n+ lots of fun\n\n- takes a while to get familiar with the game mechanics\n- losing an item when dying is annoying (you will die a lot)\n- repetitive quests\n\nAll things said, I still had fun with the game, but certain aspects stop it from being a really good game. 7 / 10","March 16, 2014","true","13.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

The top post is "NOT a ripoff of Minecraft."\n\nThe whole post is wasted on just the graphics. 3079 is a minecraft clone in that it moves, feels, and acts like Minecraft. Being a Minecraft clone is not a dirty word. In the 90s, if you were a FPS, you were a Doom-clone. If you were a 1vs1 fighter, you were a Street Fighter-clone. Tetris-clones were everywhere. But then there was Dr. Mario, and Tetris Attack, and the block-puzzle genre was born.\n\nNow that we got that out of the way, let's review 3079. It's a big open world with a randomly generated properties. There's a lot of the same. Once you've seen one building, you've seen them all. You're exploring and doing quests that surrmount to basic fetch quests. This is a game where you get out there, and shoot stuff and watch your numbers get bigger. I spent the next few hours scratching my head, wondering, "What am I supposed to do?"\n\n3079 is sparse. With a better tutorial and more interesting 'ah-ha moments', there could be something here.

It offers no real insight to anything you do, the quests are confusing and make little to no sense, and you die about as often as you  click the keys in a button masher. The gameplay can be good, if you know how to fight, and you have good gear, but in that sense, getting good gear is almost impossble without googling how. Refering to how this game had potential, since the begining of the development of 4089, its all you see on this page, there hasn't been an update on this game in months, and the developer continously keeps posting about 4089 on the 3079 page, its rather infuriating, seeing as I'd like to see news about 3079 on the 3079 page. Beyond that, if you want a good time waster this can be pretty good, but in the long run, its not gonna suit you for long.

Minecraft with guns and a grappling hook! Like Just Cause 2 in Minecraft. What's not to love?\n\nIt is like Minecraft with guns made in Java. Before the developer was done with this game, he was already hyping up the sequil. This is great for a first time developer. It is a simple Minecraft with guns. The guns work well enough, the enemies are giant and easy to hit. When you die, that's it. You crash back to the launcher. Speaking of the launcher, that's the only way to adjust the settings. Including controls. This is probably the 2nd worst button configuration I've ever seen. You select what the key does, then you find the key from a drop down list. When you set a key, chances are it unsets another key that has nothing to do with the key you just set. Such as if I set something to use the 'Right Key' then I set something to the 'Enter Key' it will set the previous 'Right Key' to the 'F2 Key.' Huh? Again, this is clearly someone's first game.\n\nWith all that being said, the game generates a random world and yet always starts you suspended high above the ground in orbit, suspended. When you find out the gravity button to drop you from the sky you might die on impact. It is quite unforgiving. If you survive the fall through the use of the gravity button, you're immediately in hostile territory. Sometimes the floating red monsters will murder you before you even land. From the start, the guns are underpowered. When you run out of ammo, you start losing health when you shoot. An understanding of enemy levels would have been nice, such as a beginner enemy should take one or two bullets. Then as you progress they take more bullets and then you find better guns or upgrade so they take less bullets.\n\nThe only redeeming factor about this game is multi-player, but really, if you're playing with friends any game will be fun, because you and your friends will always have fun. That's why they're your friends.\n\nThere are far better FPS games, which this is a FPS. I can't even call it Minecraft, since there's not much crafting or world craftability as there is with Minecraft. I just can't recommend this game. It is also very telling when a game took so long to be Greenlit.","February 17, 2014","false","2.6"," 23 of 43 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","23","43","0","1"

While I like the premise of a story, and that the grappling hooks are much more responsive, its next to impossible to complete any quests given right off the start. Partially because players are tasked with either killing an enemy without being detected (which is next to impossible in both the killing or being undetected portions), or being sent to acquire an item in the battlefield without killing anything (where ships seem to have a perfect knowledge of the players whereabouts, and drop immediately down to shoot them into a fine dust). Demons are also scattered about while trying to complete quests which allow you to actually harm them, killing you in the progress. Dying in the game results in automatically failing a quest, and losing a sometimes vital item from the inventory.\n\nI've tried on several occassions to prep as much as I can before even beginning a quest, but it always ends the same: I get killed by something stupidly powerful with no way to gain aid in game, die, and suffer a huge setback by losing some vital item. At least in 3089 the friendly NPCs were actually helpful against opposing forces...","February 25, 2014","true","1.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

What I am getting at is, barrier of entry to this game is very high in terms of commitment to get to the good stuff, and after running around in circles, getting killed and restarting the game because I did not want to suffer a permanent disadvantage long term for a game while I am still learning how it works, I ended up quickly burning myself out and wondering why this felt like such a chore.

The game has a lot of replayability and a campy feel to its visuals, setting and even missions.\n\nThe thing stopping me from playing more of the game though, is its lack of instruction. I couldn't find any weapons so was unable to do any missions. I'm sure I'm stupid and there's some easy way to figure things out, but I wasn't hooked in enough to keep trying.\n\nThe coolest thing I saw in the game was the random NPCs wandering around the world, fighting each other in unscripted mayhem. It felt weird, in an awesome way, to be standing so close to these different armies at war with themselves almost completely unaware of me.\n\nI do not think I will be playing 3079 again any time soon.

However, I felt a lot was based on luck and building your character past what wepons you wanted proved difficult. It is a very fun and addictive game but if you get stuck over encumbered and very far from any npcs it gets very dull very quickly and when you die you have no idea what might be lost untill it's far too late.

But from my experiences unless you are THE MOST CAREFUL PERSON IN THE WORLD you just get shredded! Even on easy that's right EASY I got teared apart by any enemy regardless what weapon they were using. It's fun the first minutes sure, but when the difficulty kicks in you are in trouble. I played this game once before it came to steam and i had one heck of a good time with it, but as with all games updates arrive and i found it more and more difficult to survive more than 5 minutes without having to run and gun or spam health packs. The quests in the game are good, but there is almost no variation to them at all. From what I've played i've done killing sprees, protection, hijacking, assassinations what else can I remember? Almost nothing as I don't see this game as memorable in the near future at all! The trading/byuing in the game is good though, but having to destroy crates and digging for gems to get a lot of money or just to earn a few extra credits just to be able to afford that one item that you see as life saving isn't worth it.\n\nBack to what I said about run and gun. This game has you either run from your enemy that quickly reach higher levels than what you might be prepared for, or it has you fight until you die in one spot with close to no help or followers that just die almost right away. Unless you're playing with friends it's almost impossible to win this game.\n\nIn the game you have three bars, one health, one stamina and one that I have no idea what the hell it does. You also have strength which you can increase via melee weapons or carrying way more than what your character can handle, and then there charisma, thief and so on. Try just walking right in to a cluster of enemies with some friendlies mixed in there and look at your health bar, unless you're ignored that bar will go from max to minimum in less than 10 seconds. Stamina! Don't even bother!! If your weapon can't be used because you have to little stamina and you try to shoot it you lose health to slowly up your stamina. Want to find generators or batteries that increase your stamina? Good luck! Any good generators/batteries are a long way north, west, east or south! You also use stamina to power your jetpack(Game calls it ''Anti-gravity pack''), your night visors(NVG, Night vision, Night Vision Goggles whatever you prefer),  I do believe it's also used for your radar? Not sure about that, and also camoflage! Yeah camoflage! Good idea right? No... From my experience everyone can see you if you have it activated! Enemies or if you have accidentally attacked a friendly they all see you! Oh and friendly fire is more of a b**ch than gravity it self! And I forget what else it's used for, oh yeah! YOUR WEAPONS REQUIRE A LOT OF STAMINA!!!!!!! Assualt rifles and blasters not much but any other type (melee weapons don't count as they use 0 stamina for some reason) demands a lot of stamina! And as I said good luck finding any good generators or batteries!\n\nI do not reccomend this game if you were expecting good variety, easy challenges, good experience, good shooter or a good RPG system (something close to or similar to Mario RPG, Final Fantasy, Chrono Trigger or something like that). Oh and it has a good open world system but it just doesn't have a lot of different terrain. It mostly consists of a few hills every now and then, mostly flat ground, oh hey a lake! every now and then otherwise the lakes are just what I call puddles, and a WAY to huge dessert that you get way too quickly lost in.","November 14, 2015","false","5.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Example: I haven't beaten the first mission yet, (which I think is kill a demon king from the info I collected, I still don't know yet) because the game doesn't give me any feedback at all where to go, so I have to wander around the big world aimlessly until I find it.\n\nPros:\n+Good Music\n+Good Gun System\n+Good Gameplay\n\nCons:\n-No Explaination\n-Overdone Concept\n-Empty World\n-Bad MiniMap\n\nIt's Probably better with multiplayer if you can figure out how to work it, but I give this game a...\n\n5/10\nCOULD'VE BEEN BETTER","March 11, 2014","false","6.6"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

The best way to describe this game is a girl that is everything you like in a girl both looks and personality. But therre is one downfall she is moody and is a pain to deal with but when you get past the bad it is amazing fun but with frustration.\n\nWhen first starting this game you are a level 1 in every sense. No weapons,weak,poor, cant complete quests right away,etc. But when you level up and are able to finish your first quest and get some money and loot you will become more powerful. Eventually you will do a quest that offers a demon smiter. Now you can finally kill those unfair ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and continue the story. After killing more demons and completing more quests you will become even stronger and able to explore now. At this point the game is beyond amazing but you are not invincible. Cheap deaths will happen still or demons will get you when you have low hp so keep that in mind. This game is just ♥♥♥♥ing amazing if you can make it through the brutal begining the game opens up to one of the most refreshing action rpg's I have ever played.","November 5, 2014","true","9.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Anyone can pick it up and play and enjoy it somehow - rpg fans, sandbox fans, or shooter fans. However, some of the controls can take some time to get used to. For example, I am used to "E" being inventory in Minecraft, but also "E" being use in Valve games, and I couldn't bind them both to "E" or we would have a Zelda CD-I issue. So, I have to reach all the way over to "I" for inventory. This issue is minor though. 10/10","July 8, 2014","true","0.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I'm sad to say unfortunately i wasn't particularly blown away, I got through to the end of the story, and I really wasn't interested in the game anymore. I didn't like the graphics, i felt they were just patchy and weird. I found the combat, maybe a little different because of the gun variety, but still to be a bit floaty and not so riveting.\n\nDon't get me wrong, i never really cared about negative things, since they aren't as bad in this game, i felt it just didn't have anything really positive. Its a mediocore game that was slightly dull and a few strange decisions within the art style and gameplay. I felt everything was very clunky and nothing was exciting to see or do. I found the building capture missions quite clever and the stealth system doesn't exactly suck, just as said before, not to exciting.\n\nI hope in the future the developers learn from their mistakes and make something more fun. I felt they tried to keep everyone happy and doing so dulling out their game. As a famous quote is said "You can please all of the people some of the time and some of the people all of the time, but you can't please all of the people all of the time."\n\n3.5/10","February 11, 2014","false","7.8"," 1 of 9 people (11%) found this review helpful","11","1","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cannedfeces/recommended/259620/","cannedfeces","ploq","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cannedfeces/","255 products in account","UPADTED REVIEW!!! THIS IS A REVIEW OF 3079 - A Block Action RPG AFTER PLAYING ON A MORE CAPABLE COMPUTER. THE ORIGINAL REVIEW CAN BE FOUND BELOW vvv.\n\n3079 -- Block Action RPG is an RPG in space. It is a voxel-based game as well. While the graphics style is almost alike, the two games (Minecraft and 3079) are significantly different. In my first review, I hadn't had the capability to play really any of the game, but once I upgraded my entire computer, I realize the framerate issue i had was simply my original graphics card.\n\nAt this point, one of the only complaints I have with 3079 is the gunplay. The starting pistol is next to useless, and its inaccurate as all hell. There are no iron-down sights, but I don't feel the game would benefit from it anyway. Now that 3089 has been released, I think complaining about this is pointless anyway, just avoid all enemies.\n\nI still can't recommend this game. Even after playing at a stable framerate, I still didn't quite understand what I was intended to do. The "storyline" isn't specific enough, it's too broad and it honestly doesn't tell you much. Tell you what, if you enjoy games that are just a f!ck all shoot-em-up, by all means, buy this game. But if you're looking for an experience, an in-depth storyline with lovable characters and great gameplay, I'd sooner recommend Postal 2.\n\nFinal scoring:\nStoryline: 5/10\nGameplay: 3/10\nReplayability: 6/10\nCreatveness: 9/10\n\noh yeah, about the price. One of the comments said I shouldn't be telling a dev how much to charge for a game. They were right, I shouldn't be. I've had plenty of failed Kickstarters and failed Greenlight projects, so I understand the frustration of someone telling you your hard work isn't worht what they thought. I apologize for saying what the price should be, $7 is a good price if you're into games like this.\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW:::::\nLet's all be honest here. This game, like Ace of Spades or Guncraft, looks exactly like Minecraft. Difference between Guncraft and this game is that the theme/idea is executed a whole lot better in Guncraft than in this game.\n\nLet me give you in introduction to this game. You are an astronaut (I believe) who spawns in the game roaming through space. You're told by an unknown "commander" to reach a base. Naturally, you land on a planet and think things out for a few minutes, because there's NOTHING ELSE IN SIGHT. You're told to avoid evil red creatures, but if they catch you, you (obviously) die.\n\nThere's an introduction. That's all I got out of it. When you die, you go to an unknown place. Not just any unknown place, a laggy unknown place. On low graphics, I got maybe 15 FPS at best. I get better FPS when playing Borderlands 2, and I don't play that much because it's too laggy.\n\nLet me ask you this. Based on the infromation I gave you, do you really want this game? When I first bought it, it wasn't in Early Access, so I figured the game must have been finished enough to play. But I was sadly mistaken, I seemed to have wasted $7 on a perfectly useless game. Once I left the laggy unknown place... oh wait, you can't! When I died, my jetpack was taken away.\n\nOverall, 2/10, 15/100, 47/1000, 127/10,000, etc\n\nI get what Phr00t is trying to do. Don't get me wrong, an open world block shooter game is a great idea, but it needs to be executed in such a way that is doesn't cause lag, and so that the storyline can somewaht make sense. Also, this game was made using Java. A game made by a free software, and he's charging $7. To be honest, you should only pay maybe $3 for this.","January 28, 2014","false","0.8"," 2 of 12 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","2","12","0","8"

While playing I found myself consistently frustrated at tasks that were nearly impossible to complete (due to the fact that everything, missions and terrain, are procedurally generated). The controls are fairly hard to get used to (especially in the aircraft), and the only tutorial is a screen with control mappings. Because the game is significantly different than most other games out there, a fully realized tutorial would be immensely helpful.\n\nWhile there were parts of the game I really enjoyed, I thought some serious polish was still needed to be playable in the long term. I will certainly try out the sequel (3089) and see if they've polished these issues, as the concept is quite excellent.","December 25, 2013","false","4.1"," 5 of 24 people (21%) found this review helpful","21","5","24","0","2"

The idea is interesting. The system seems well thought out. Yet, the insane difficulty is a complete turnoff for me. 2 hours of trial and error and I finally got to the surface with all my gear (which I don't think was supposed to happen). But that's okay because it still didn't matter. It didn't matter which quest I took, I inevitately failed miserably, each death resulted in one less item and soon I was essentially defenseless. The final straw was a mission to sneek out and retrieve something without being seen. So I turned on my camoflauge (slow movement) and crept to the area. As far as I could tell there was nothing nearby it should be a cakewalk. I ended being blown up by ??? I don't know there was nothing there! I wasn't spotted (which would have ended the mission) before hand, I was just dead. But of course death ended the mission. This follows a series of equally inane and frustrating mishaps where I found myself slaughtered and useless over and over and over again. If I wanted insane difficulty I would play a rouge-like, but even then there is a sense of progress - not here.","January 18, 2014","false","2.4"," 0 of 14 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","14","0","0"

For a retro feeling? All it did was make everything look ugly! THe people look freakishly deformed, as the human generator just changes the design of the charaters by adjusting their BODY PART SIZES!\n\nYou can die in so many ways, it's impossible to play. The Enemies bigger than you, logically, can step you you. But there's no warning of that, you just GET CLOSE AND THEY DAMAGE YOU! YOu can Hijack the incredibly OP fighters, only to find they're made of paper and explode if you GRAZE the ground. Enemy Fighter, though, are made out of Diamonds, they can ram into you and never blow up! Capital ships can wreck you with one hit, Demons suck you in and you need a special sword to kill them, ect.\n\nYou guns? They use the incredibly stupid function of an ENERGY BAR in order to fire. This is absolutely the worst ammo Idea in history. You CANNOT CHANNEL YOUR SUIT BATTERY INTO A SEPARATE GUN THE MOMENT YOU PICK IT UP! This is one of the things that annoys me in Starbound, but at least THAT'S playable!\n\nQuests are annoying as well, there can only be ONE active quest at a time, and if you die ONCE, no matter what killed you, you lose the quest. Terrific. What tops it off is that you lose a random Item every time you die.\n\nThe game's AI is terrible. If they're not swarming eachother, they are aimbotting their way to killing you.

After restarting the save I finally figured out what to do, and it was honestly painful to keep playing.  Not because of what I had to do, but simply because the graphics discusted me, there was no explicit tutorial, and it required me to memorize very abstract names of everything, without any clear story.  4 hours into the game, I finally figure out whats going on, and what I need to do.  With level 8 gear I set out and defeated the final boss without knowing it, expecting there to be more afterward.  Needless to say, there was nothing afterward, and this sandbox of a world became even more useless.  It is clear now that this game is specifically designed for a younger crowd who would enjoy the odd graphics and objectiveless gameplay through a multiplayer experience.\n\nIn all honestly, if I could get a refund, I definately would.  And I do not recommend this game to anyone unless you are 12 years old and have several friends of similar age you can play this game with.  In which case, you'd probably get a solid kick out of the game and maybe log 400 hours on it.

I think the negative reviews are a result of people not understanding what type of game this is, as someone else pointed out it's somewhat like doom meets daggerfall (purely in a genre way), the game isn't particularly doom-like, but it is a "primitive" fps with old school rpg elements. There is alot of content in this game despite it's small download size and the simplicity of the graphics of course.\n\nOverall I recommend this game if you like the genre and style, and want a game that isn't the typical multiplayer nonsense, or AAA bad game with good graphics waste of your time. It's a good way to kill a half hour, or ten or twenty minutes of your free time, and doesn't overdo itself, or take itself too seriously. I just bought another one of "phr00t"'s games, because I like this one, and I hope you keep on making better games. I feel that this format and the developers game making style could potentially make the perfect old school rpg, or first person roguelike rpg..with a little work and improvement.","January 21, 2015","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You'll probably die 1 or 2 times at level 1 but once you figured out how to get gear you can take on enemies that are 2 levels higher without to much of a problem.\n-Many playstyles available. You want to be a thief? No problem. You want to fight with guns? No problem. You want to rush to enemies that are 100m away in 2 seconds and kill them with your sword? Good luck but no problem.\n-The ability to place your own blocks. You can build your own house, storage and place several blocks that are both helpful in your home and on the field as long as you have the ingame money to afford that playstye.\n\nBad things:\n-Horrible ai pathing. Don't expect the ai to be any good. You can yell at an ai when there is a straight path to you and they will still have difficulty reaching you. The movement of the ai is pretty much random making it difficult to aim. In general the enemy's make for easy targets while friendly's are mostly useless.\n-Boring graphics. Even when it comes to block based games the graphics are not impressive. They are not bad enough to ruin the immersion but they definetely don't help it a lot.\n-Very few options to customize your house. You have 2 types of building blocks, 1 type of door block and the only options other than that are home blocks and storage blocks. The only reason to actually build a house is to get protection from the demons but you might as well set up in an existing building.\n-Many types of humanoids and neanders should just not be in the game. Many of them are way to big to do anything other than be a target or shoot a target. While there also are clearly jetpacks for sale there are only 2 types of neanders and humanoids when it comes to movement. The floating ones and the ones that never leave the ground.\n-The map is pretty much useless. You can only set 1 waypoint at a time which gets removed when you reach it. Meaning that you basically have to write down coordinates if you're building more than 1 house or find something interesting. And even with the coordinates you're looking for a while because they only indicate a big area and not a single location.\n\nMy conclussion: It's a nice game to spend a few hours on every now and then but don't expect to play it for many days in a row. There are plenty of better games that you can buy for this price. Only buy this game when you have a few hours to waste and can't find a more interesting game to buy.","March 20, 2014","false","10.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

First off, I don't know if I would call it a role-playing game at all, it's more of an adventure FPS that has quests, equipable items, and skill increases...well, maybe that's enough to be an RPG.  Either way, the engine and music in this game are very good.  It's a very fun, sandboxy experience; however, as far as it being a game goes, it needs some work.  The game is in desperate need of a tutorial, and it takes quite a lot of trial and error to figure out what you're supposed to do.  Even after reading all the help menus and tips it took me three new game instances before I figured out to go into my inventory and turn of my jetpack to land instead of flying around aimlessly until I got killed by demons.  The quests are also recycled a lot and it's pretty difficult to get anything done without dying.\n\nThat said, if we don't look at this title as a game and instead look at it as a sandbox engine and tech demo I'm pretty impressed.  As stated above the music is *really* nice, and it's fun to play around in the engine for an hour or so (the grappling hook is my favorite).  There's also a boatload of settings to go through (anti-aliasing, field of view, completely customizable controls - always a big bonus!) and a pretty simple multiplayer feature that hosts a local server with the basic game client.\n\nAlthough I'd pass on recommending this game (unless you're looking for a well put-together sandbox game engine) I'm impressed with what the developer has created so far and am looking forward to future, more gameplay polished releases.","July 6, 2014","false","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Many of them are way to big to do anything other than be a target or shoot a target. While there also are clearly jetpacks for sale there are only 2 types of neanders and humanoids when it comes to movement. The floating ones and the ones that never leave the ground.\n-The map is pretty much useless. You can only set 1 waypoint at a time which gets removed when you reach it. Meaning that you basically have to write down coordinates if you're building more than 1 house or find something interesting. And even with the coordinates you're looking for a while because they only indicate a big area and not a single location.\n\nMy conclussion: It's a nice game to spend a few hours on every now and then but don't expect to play it for many days in a row. There are plenty of better games that you can buy for this price. Only buy this game when you have a few hours to waste and can't find a more interesting game to buy.","March 20, 2014","false","10.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When you explore theres more to explore and where I'm currently at feels like some high level mountains all high level stuff. Yet still a long way to go for the leveling on my gears and such. I honestly say you should try it for how much it's worth is awesome.\n\nI think what you really need to know the only lacking for this game that MIGHT feel lacked is the way the npcs look from super sized and small, it could be more better and then with a nice improved normal sized npcs then it may look more improved. As I worry that people don't take the game because it's a decent fun cheap game but the npcs looks obvious to some people that it's "urghh.." I hope you understand what I mean but umm besides that, it is an epic game. Play it for a week or so and keep trying to try harder and lvl higher and so on. I personally think you should play this for a while then play the newer version.","April 4, 2014","true","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Der Spieler strandet auf einem hart umkämpften Planeten, wo er den freundlichen Humoids in ihrem Krieg gegen die Neanders und böse Dämonen zur Seite steht, sowohl zu Lande, als auch in der Luft. Die auf Voxel basierende Grafik ist stark von Minecraft inspiriert und dementsprechend besteht die Landschaft aus Blöcken und ist extrem verpixelt. Ebenso können manche Blöcke zerstört und neue Blöcke oder auch Fahrstühle und bewaffnete Türme mit dem entsprechenden Werkzeug gesetzt werden, allerdings nur in begrenztem Maß, ist das Werkzeug aufgebraucht muss ein neues her. Das Spielprinzip erinnert stark an Titel wie Borderlands: Es gilt dutzende Items zu sammeln, darunter verschiedene Arten von Schilden, Medikits und Radars sowie diverse Arten von Waffen, wobei manche wie bei Borderlands durch zusätzliche Effekte entweder mehr Schaden austeilen oder dem Spieler z.B. durch schnellere Energieaufladung helfen. Auch das Levelsystem erinnert an Borderlands. Die Waffen verbrauchen keine Munition, sondern Energie. Je stärker die Waffe, desto mehr Energie wird pro Schuss verbraucht. Ist der Energiebalken leer, muss einen Moment gewartet werden, bis er sich ausreichend aufgeladen hat. Dem kann der Spieler durch das Sammeln und Aktivieren von Generatoren und Batterien entgegenkommen. Seine Aufträge erhält der Spieler von den sogenannten "Leaders" der Humoids, welche mit einem Stern markiert sind. Überschüssige Items können bei den mit einem Dollar-Zeichen markierten "Merchants" gegen Credits, die Spielwährung, verkauft werden. So findet man sich ratzfatz in einem absoluten Sammelwahn wieder, immer auf der Jagd nach noch besseren und schlagkräftigeren Items.\n\nFAZIT: Man erhält hier viel Spaß für wenig Geld und Festplattenplatz. Für Fans von Minecraft und (vorallem!) Borderlands ist dieser Titel definitiv einen Blick wert! Vorallem aber auch, weil es durch sein Oldschool-Spielprinzip und die verpixelte Grafik an die guten alten Zeiten erinnert, als ein Spieler nicht nur kurz in Deckung gehen musste, um sich zu erholen.","November 16, 2013","true","0.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

If you can get it cheap, you might want to pick it up, esspecialy if you like the rest of the series.\nYou can explore, and as you go farther out, the higher level the 'bad guys' get, so you can stick around areas that you find not too tough at your point in the game.\nThe fighting is fairly simple. Weapons come in a nice varity, from swords and daggers, to sniper rifles, and even a few rocket or grenade launchers. Weapons for every kind of person!\nThe various enemies are separated in 4 types most of the time, Walking melee, walking ranged, flying melee, and flying ranged... and sometimes the 5th type, spaceship. You can guess what each one does. They all have somewhat randomized body shapes, the team you start on has 2 legs, and the other has 4. That is the main way to tell who you're with. Though flying people don't have any legs...\nIf you decide to build... something, you have to find or buy a special item. Even if you don't want to build a house, it can be useful, because you have healing blocks, and turrets in the building section.\nMissions have a small bit of variation, some you have to pick up an item, others you have to kill a thing, others you have to protect a guy, and they give various rewards, usualy money or weapons. Some you also don't want to be seen, and/or kill anything.\nOn the subject of stealth, you mainly use an invisibility... thing, and... ok, it's been a while since I played this. I never used this much tbh.\nOverall, it's a decent game. Give it a shot if you can get it cheap.","March 17","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/burshoo/recommended/259620/","burshoo","Bushro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/burshoo/","155 products in account","Playing this is both very enjoyable and incredibely frustrating. It's a somewhat difficult first person shooter with a bunch of RPG elements. Procedural generation and randomized aspects, such as algorithmic quests and unscripted faction battles that will certainly change the topography of the map, give the game a majestic feeling and some replay value. At that appraisal, I should have nothing but love for this game, but unfortunately it frequently dips into the realm of taking otherwise good ideas and implementing them in the most extreme, unenjoyable ways.\n\nFor example, simply starting a new game is a matter of chance, as the starting equipment you receive may not match your play style, and it is very easy to die in the beginning of the game even with desirable inventory, often due to low-damage, low-accuracy weapons. Meanwhile, enemies get very accurate weapons that are often scaled far better than your own. 99% of better weapons can be found on dead enemies.\n\nIf you survive your first several hours, you will discover that the difficulty and shop scaling is based on how far away you go from the initial spawn point. This makes some sense, to keep the player from constantly being bombarded by overpowered baddies, but it also turns the beaten paths into a tedious slog with little reason to ever backtrack, except maybe for a quest.\n\nThe difficulty is the most noticeable problem, however. Apart from inaccurate guns, there is also the constant issue of rules that just don't apply to enemies, but do apply to the player. Enemies don't get hurt by their own explosions. Their ships never crash. Friendly fire is off for them.\nThe biggest problem is the punishment for dying. Upon death, the player loses one random item, and this can absolutely cripple a character build if the item in question is particularly useful. For example, if I die and lose a powerful antigrav pack, which allows the player to fly, then replacing it with an equally strong pack requires a trip back to the intense enemy territory where can be found the only stores which sell items that useful. In the worst case I had, it was a 20 minute round trip. Long story short, the punishment for dying is really just that, punishment, not really fun or interesting at all. I did find a bit of a way to circumvent this, by filling my inventory with crap that I don't mind using, but, surprise surprise, I can't fly like that either.\n\nAs much as I've complained about it here, this game is actually quite worth the money. It's addicting, and it provides a decent level of depth. There are the parts that make me want to tear my hair out, but that's balanced out by fun.","April 1","true","11.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I gave up on the story after it asked me to take down a borg cube-lookalike demon ship with a flying vehicle that explodes after just one hit and me trying that for an hour. The demon ship requires like I-don't-know-how-many hits as it keeps healing back up and I can't avoid not get hit long enough while I evade enemy fire from multiple sources at the same time. I assume this is likely me doing it just wrong.\n\nI kept walking West instead as I noticed earlier enemies become stronger if you keep walking, hoping to find a vessel that lasts more than one hit, but nope. I bought armor instead, did some of the neverending skirmishes around town, sold all loot I didn't need, walked West again, more skirmishes, shiny new weapon... and so on and so on, until... till after everything was around level 80 and capable of killing me in like two hits - that's because of the way your character improves: it gets better as stats and abilities are frequented. So, if you don't take damage from enemies as you move up in levels your max life won't increase. This requires you to stay in an area, work on your skills (as in take damage on purpose, for example) and only then move on.\n\nIt doesn't help when you think, you could just travel far for a shopping tour, come back and enjoy the game that way. Yes, you can do that but the progress remaining is the progress itself. If you can make it far and survive somehow in higher areas there's no point in going back as everything from back there is also right where you are - always. Except the little Minecraft-ish things you can build, like /home, chests, lamps and a few blocks. THAT does not move with you.\n\nThen it came to me: This isn't going to stop, it keeps on rising, so yeah, 3079 is incremental!? I bet, someone already made a Youtube video of how far he could make it and end up in like level 3400 with 12400 stamina, or something. It wouldn't surprise me. If not, it should be made but I won't be the one doing it.\n\nWhat I do love though is the grappling hook that turns you into Spiderman, tons of fun to use and the soundtrack is b!tching too. This kept me playing for a few more hours (as I was looking for plot) than just the two it takes to see it all. What the game lacks is a proper story, sturdier flying ships (!) and maybe a few bosses, then it would be a decent game rather than just a fine one that feels unfinished.","March 29","false","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
