The mechanics are so easy to pick up and play but it way more fun than it seems. The gameplay is just so satisfying, pick up fist, throw fist, avoid other fists. It's so easy to understand, but once you start playing you realize it has a lot of potential.\n\nI've been playing the singleplayer and that part really solid as well, and it's quite challenging as well. you encounter enemies and situations you would not normal see in multiplayer so it really is worth checking out. The last boss is just hilariously fun, Uncle Knuckle, like c'mon, UNCLE KNUCKLE is such a great name, he even has his name "tattooed" on his knuckles.\n\nI can't wait to play this with my friends when they come over. This is perfect for local couch multiplayer.","May 12","true","4.1"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Bots, where the chat was able to vote for effects to happen in the game. Like Superspeed, Slowmotion etc.\n\nAll in all it was an absolutely amazing experience, and i encourage both casual players, speedrunners and streamers to pick up this game!\n\n(I played the game in a Alpha -Pre Release and expect the game to be even better when it drops May 12th)\nVideo from Version 0.9 = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ep6MadWKnF4","May 12","true","6.0"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

It reminds me a lot of bomberman, only you get to hurl rocket propelled fists at people! It's great! I love the fact that this game also includes LOCAL multiplayer! Not many games have that feature anymore and it's just sad. I also appreciate the level editor to the game. That should make multiplayer even more interesting with having custom maps! I really also enjoyed playing the single player part of this game. There are 5 sectors and at first, they are a breeze. Then you get to sector 4 and it feels like a completely different game, and that's on normal mode! I really enjoyed this fun little game and I think many others will as well.

I'm loving this game.\n\nSingle player: If you fly through on easy wont take much time at all. Bump it up and the npcs and bosses will give you a fun challenge. Boss Fights are amazing and well thought out, They are not reskinned NPC's each boss is its own individual appearance and mechanices to challenge you.\n\nLocal Play: Hella fun to punch(fist) your friends and family. Kill shots can be saved as .gifs so you can forever remember the time you owned them.\n\nOnline Multiplayer: It's in Beta. Still fun, Kinks are still being worked out, just like any other online game, if someone has a crappy connection it can cause major issues.\n\nTwitch Intergration: Amazing. Simply Put if your a streamer this game lets the chat be apart of the fun. In single Player the enemies take on the viewers names. In Local multiplayer Chat gets to decided on what gets added to pump up the action. Slow motion, bubbles, etc. Just fun.  Like mentioned above Online Multiplayer is in beta but im positive once the kinks are worked out the twitch love on online will be just as awesome.\n\nOverall: Really fun to stream. Check it out.

Despite being an indie game Rocket Fist presents a lot of characteristics that can make this game a rival of a lot of bigger games out there.\nStarting from the graphic is really cool: something like 8/10. The character constuction seems pretty solid, with quite a good amount of customization. The mechanis of the game can be a bit tricky at the beginning (I needed some minutes for actually understanding what to do) but once you know how to move everything becomes much easier!\nI suggest you to play this game because it's really cool.\nI also made a LP video for a first impression of the Adventure mode and I had a lot of fun!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTs8uwq0kU","May 12","true","0.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SavrinDrake/recommended/413500/","SavrinDrake","Savrin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SavrinDrake/","211 products in account","Product received for free\n\nRocket Fist is exactly what it says on the tin- fast paced robot dodgeball. Super simple control scheme, quick deaths and restarts, and catchy music by Thiago Adamo get you into the rocket fisting groove. The story mode is basic, but consists of a series of challenge rooms culminating with a boss. I managed to get up to the 5th stage in my solo playtime and while the enemy variety is not the most vast each of the different opposing bots presents their own challenge. One annoying thing I found was the bomb cannon enemies- their projectile will kill you if it hits, but once it stops you can pick it up and throw it back. I occasionally had some issues with knowing when it was ok to touch them, so my ProTip is just avoid em.\n\nOnline VS was not available before launch, but I had my recording partner James over so we engaged in some local vs play. We only did 1v1 but it was a series of short brutal games. It was quite a lot of fun and I hope I can get some 4 player action going here soon. Survival and Deathmatch modes are both available, but with it being only 1v1- we didn't turn on bots- we didn't really see much difference.\n\nAs a bonus to PC users, the game also includes a level editor that's fairly intuitive. It even includes multiple symmetry options, so you can make mirrored maps quite easily. That will greatly increase the longevity of the game and if it gets Workshop support for sharing them it'll help things along.\n\nOption wise this game has a massive amount of supported languages, the usual array of resolution options, multiple AA settings, vibration on/off, and 3 different graphics settings in case you have a potato.\n\nOverall, I had a lot of fun. You can see my video preview here if you'd like to see some gameplay and hear the in-game music.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cjoUntSB1k\n\n\n","May 12","true","3.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I love party games. I wish I could have a party for people to play party games more often. Or at least have friends...but at least I was able to play this game with a few roommates for a half hour. And really, that\'s what you\'ll find, you\'ll play this game with friends for 30 minutes and really enjoy yourselves. You don\'t have to get all wrapped up in it and get stuck playing it for the entirity of the party, it\'s definitely a pick up and play, drop-in, drop-out sort of game. The game is pretty much as simple as it gets. It\'s basically like Ricochet if Ricochet didn\'t suck...and was top down...and...aww screw it, you just throw fists at each other and can bounce them off walls. The gameplay is so hectic at times you need a replay to be able to figure out what happened.\n\nThe developer sent me this to try out (a very ecclectic dev at that) but would I spend $15 on this game? Probably not. I feel like the real draw of this game is the party multiplayer, not the rest of the game, despite it being full featured with a single player campaign and a level editor. So I would say this is a good buy on sale, especially if you\'re looking for a fun time killer for a group of friends (I only played local which worked very well, but there\'s an online mode as well).\n\nIf you want to see some gameplay, check it out here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3J♥♥♥IwCPio\n\nHappy fisting everyone!","May 31","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
