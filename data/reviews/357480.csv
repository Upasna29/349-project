Frozen FF:SBF is clearly a game supposed to play on Pads/Tablet PCs. But who ever had the idea to bring it to Steam FORGOT TO INTEGRATE MOUSE CONTROLS.\nThat can be gamebreaking. For example when in higher levels there is a timelimit and you cannot reach a powerup in time because of the WASD & Spacebar controls. Apropos powerups: You see many at the beginning which are just for the tuorial levels. You will loose them after and get 1 powerup per each earned 75 stars. That's just ridiculous.\n\nIf you fail a level you also loose a life symbolized as a red heart. You start with 15 lives. But if they run out quickly you have to wait for your daily award and be lucky or BUY them in the store. This store is marvelous well integrated into Steam. 70 Hearts = 8.90 EUR, Powerups 1 EUR each. After click you land directly from this awful graphics in the last checkout screen of Steam. Don't click there wrong! No sane man would buy this crap even accidently. Btw who is the target group for this game I wonder. Little kids? With this incorporated perfideous microtransactions system certainly not. Grownups maybe. But only if you have enough time and nerves.\n\nThe game itself is divided into two parts: Firstly the Free Fall (FF) is the SP and used to unlock stars and characters. Something tells me that you are barely able to unlock all characters for free. It gets  harder fastly because at lvl15 there are time limits introduced like 60 secs to reach 40k points. Your lives go away like cat lives. And the three star goal is even higher.\n\nInteresting find: The game gives you the illusion everything is random. But I figured out the starting position in each level is always the same. So it's more like a puzzle which you have to solve quickly in time. That can be useful but also shows the bad quality of surprise. The game just knows if you are unable to make any further move and then randomizes slowly the map new.\n\nThe second mode is the Snowball Fight (SBF) which is MP (haha it's just local MP. You would not have expected here any ingenius netcode). You should have unlocked all characters in SP and already know how to play this game basically. Then you are able to puzzle again and do 50 snowball fights against yourself.\n\nSo if you are still interested to checkout this partly unfair & unbalanced, perfideous microtransactions using, awful graphics & storyless masterpiece of negativity then go on.","September 16, 2015","false","34.7"," 122 of 132 people (92%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","92","122","132","9","3"

Not worth it. FTP is locked behind "lives", and I expected to be able to play long enough to unlock the characters for multiplayer, but no such luck. Once the timer is introduced, the random nature, and smaller field size (and yes...I see what you did there), make the game essentially unplayable without "timeouts" like I'm stuck on a cell phone or something again. No thanks. PC port of a mediocre game + gametime "lockout" + random "unwinnable" smaller playing fields on a timer = No thanks.

The levels start out easy to get you playing, but after a certain point (about an hour or so) you have to pay to win/progress. The later levels are designed to be near impossible (if not impossible?) without spending real money on items.

The other minor difference from candy crushers is that you get aan auto win in the form of a freefall, where after a certain point the game gives you powerups based on your moves and blows up your board with them.

Microtransactions for another life or another powerup are naturally a part of this game.\n\nThe Gameplay used to be only controllable with the arrow keys and the spacebar which didn't really bother me at all. Now they've updated it and gave it mouse support and also added in some Trading Cards, which you can only aquire if you ever bought anything in the game or via Gems.\n\nThe Game itself is a mobile port and is as such a pretty nice 3-match game with good graphics and a cute animation next to it. The only new thing there is to the PC Version of this game is the Local Multiplayer. No online Multiplayer only local and only on the same keyboard / PC. No Lan connection.\n\nI personally find that the game is alot of fun but at the same time I think the Microtransactions are rather annoying as it breaks the game. What I mean by that is that the game is on purpose unfair because it wants me to buy as many lifes or powerups as possible to be able to pass the levels. Although ones a day you can win a powerup by Chance. But we all know that the most expensive powerup will not be the one you click on.\n\nI do love Match-3 Games but I am not a fan of those kinda methods.\n\nAnother annoying part is the achievements, as they seem rather easy to get. They are actually not. At least not without spending all your money on it. Which I find personally sad, I would rather work to get an achievement or even play for a long time but not buy them.\n\nIf you are a fan of Match-3 Games and like to spend lots of money than I do recommend you to get this game. If you just want to have fun on a local PC to play together, than I also do recommend to get this game.\n\nI do not recommend this game to anybody who likes Match-3 Games and doesn't want to spend any money on the game, you will have a hard and annoying time. I also do not recommend this game to anybody that doesn't like Match-3 Games.\n\nPlease Note that this Game is from Disney, Disney makes alot of money and I do not understand why they have to destroy such a beautiful game with their greed.","October 8, 2015","false","1.6"," 30 of 36 people (83%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","83","30","36","10","4"

Big ol' Candy Crush ripoff sloppily ported from mobile, has a versus mode if you want to set the kids at each other's throats. If you want that, go for it.\n\nThe rest of the story: this is one of the weirder slapdash mobile ports I've seen. Usually people make you use the mouse like it was finger for swipe controls, but this game is, as far as I can tell, entirely mouse-free. Thank god it's a slow, plan-your-moves based title and not Bejeweled, eh? The big problem is it's got a f2p energy system which can also be asked to charge you for bonus powerups, lives, the works. Straight up the only thing that separates this from a Candy Crush or the like is the license. It's not amazing, but if you're the sort who plugs away at those because "hey, it's free" and are willing to put up with the occasional recharge cooldown or what-not, go for it. I'm not.\n\n(Also there's some other technical fiddliness. It doesn't fit on my screen. The lives counter is cut off, I had to go into the cash shop to actually find out how many I had left.)","September 15, 2015","false","0.4"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

I can finally write a review.\n\nFrozen Free Fall is a matching game at its core and can be compared to games like: Candy Crush, Soda Saga, and Bejeweled. The only main difference is that it's based on the world of Frozen.\n\nFirst things first, if you don't like Frozen, you will NOT enjoy this game.\n\nA few quick things before I list the Pros and cons:\n\n1) You don't have to pay anything to complete all levels, I didn't so you shouldn't have to either.\n2) This game will make you want to buy stuff, trust me.\n3) All characters can be unlocked for free.\n4) There is now partial mouse support.\n\nPros:\n+Lots of Levels\n+Based in the world of Frozen\n+Free to play\n+Beautiful Unity based game (I was actually suprised at the character design looking so good)\n+More content in the future (Hopefully Free)\n+A well made port from the web based version\n+Devs listen to the community for the most part\n+Lots of variety in the levels\n\nCons:\n-3 songs in the game. 1 song you hear so much that you will want to rip your hair out.\n-An Obvious cash grab. I don't blame the devs for this though. Blame Disney.\n-Some levels are so stupid hard that you are ALMOST forced to buy items without playing the levels over and over.\n-Sound glitches when getting too big of a combo, its actually very funny XD\n-No actual Songs, or voices from the movie.\n-Only partial mouse support. I ended up not using the mouse anyway.\n\nIn conclusion, the game itself isnt all that bad. Yes it is a cash Grab for people that don't want to try hard. I give props the the Developers for making the game look so good on the unity engine! There are definitly better matching games out there though and I recommend you play them. Unless you really like Frozen. I will Recommend this game solely on the fact that its free and you dont have to pay anything other then your time.\n\n-Okami","September 30, 2015","true","655.3"," 58 of 101 people (57%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","57","58","101","22","12"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thisisbanhammer/recommended/357480/","thisisbanhammer","dokkan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thisisbanhammer/","79 products in account","Frozen Free Fall: Snowball Fight, a game based on the 2013 American 3D computer-animated musical fantasy comedy film produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios, Frozen, is a deep game that has to do with the life of Elsa and Anna. They go on throughout the game, as the title suggests, snowball fighting.\nFrozen Free Fall is on many consoles and devices including PC, Playstation 4, and mobile devices.\n\nStory- Many fans believe that Frozen Free Fall: Snowball Fight has to be exact with the movie rendition, yet it is so much better without connecting the movie with itself. The deep backstory for why Olaf and Anna must fight with snowballs makes the player ponder at life. This storyline is one of the most in depth stories I have ever seen in a video game, very near that of Mario Kart Wii.\n\nCharacters- A wide variety of your favorite Frozen characters are available for you to use and unlock. Although some are for real life currency, I guarantee that it will be worth the spare change.\n\nGameplay- A crazy puzzle to get through level to level, main menu to the actual game, Frozen Free Fall: Snowball Fight challenges the player to think creatively and act thoughtfully. The act of misclicking could end a game quick, whether it be the x-button to close the game or the jewel that could do absolutely nothing. Multiplayer is also an option if you want to play the game competitively. There may be a few balancing patches, for a skilled Olaf may beat any Elsa. Elsa may be the strongest character in this game, if not fiction as a whole.\n\nOverall rating- 10/10\nThe game is an amazing example of how a game should be made for a movie. A game free of bugs, Frozen Free Fall: Snowball Fight allows a joyful time for everyone, besides the friend who is getting whooped in multiplayer. Items are given to the player to enhance their gameplay and give the game a more competitive nature. This game is honestly high in the rankings with Super Smash Bros. Melee for the Nintendo Gamecube, League of Legends, and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. I highly suggest that you get this game immediately even if you are not a fan of the movie Frozen.","April 19","true","143.9"," 16 of 25 people (64%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","64","16","25","14","5"

Thankfully there's already a note regarding it being in the next upgrade(s).\n\nOverall, it's not a bad time killer if you don't care about the store, and really don't want to spend anything on the game itself.

I probably started off like you, reading some of the 5 to 6 word reviews and thought to myself, ehh I will just give it a try and see for myself. Here are my thoughts on this game.\n\nWhen you start up the game, you will quickly realize that you do not have mouse support while using this game. You are to solely rely on the keyboard to navigate throughout the game. For me, this was already an annoyance, but I still wanted to give the game a fair shot. Once you continue through the story portion, you can then begin the actual game play. Like you can gather by screenshots and other reviews, it is a simple “match three items” kind of game. Once you match certain items on the board, you can either cancel out the items and make room for new items to drop, or you can create a special item that has special powers that may in a later turn cancel out multiple items on the board. (Very much like Candy Crush) However, what you may not have thought of is that you can only use the keyboard, so what used to be a simple task with the mouse, turned into a confusing mess.\n\nSince this is a free-to-play game, I opted to give it a fair shot. I do think it is a cute game for young gamers, but it can be frustrating and even confusing at times. One other quick thing to keep in mind prior to installing this game is although it is free-to-play, once you run out of lives, you will have to purchase more lives to continue.\nThe pricing is as follows:\n5 lives for 99 cents, 32 lives for $4.99, and 70 lives for $9.99\n","January 9","false","1.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

You can buy them.\nNeed extra lives? You can buy them as well.\nWhat's funny is that Oaken is the shopkeeper for them - which reminds me, didn't Kristoff call him a "crook" in the film?\n\nAll in all, it feels like little more than the "House of Mouse" making a little cash grab and tainting the Frozen franchise to do it.  It's a damned shame too, I really enjoyed Frozen.\nMy advice?   Play it for a little and then, when you get bored of it or sick of the game hitting you up to buy stuff.

Point scoring is based off of the basic "3in-a-row match ups" system. You can always score more points using combos as usual, and a certain point limit is needed to reach the end of each level. This is another text book definition of slapping a theme over another game.\n\nFrozen Free Fall also comes included with a cash shop! The most you can spend on value packs for useless items and to ruin in-game progression is at least $50-$80 for the one time buys, and the items will absolutely have no mercy on your wallet. Wait, what's that? You simply won't buy the items? Well I hope you're ready for pain like nothing you've ever felt before!\n\nAs for Multi-player, I can't even connect to the servers. Isn't that swell?\n\nDisney, this isn't Andrioid/iOS. This is a very popular VIDEOGAME platform where users can purchase and download ACTUAL games. This isn't the platform to upload your cash-in mobile games.","September 15, 2015","false","0.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Similar to how the original movie did. Then once starting a game it has player progression, starting with young Kristoff, similar to the movie. It also has a very good tutorial, showing you the basics and the advanced moves.  As you progress through the first couple levels, you are greeted to two more characters. And with this detailed tutorial, you will understand quickly what to do.  It then introduces something new, moving objects from the top, to the bottom. What they do fine with introducing this, is that it is very easy for newcomers, as it progressivly gets more and more difficult. Losing at level 9 will then result in how unclear the tutorial was, and you then become angry at it. You then try to play it again, but result in more failing until it asks you to buy more lives.

Let alone let them on steam without parent supervision, you know why I got this game, because of the cards, because I need it to level up.\n\nThe gameplay is just a bejewled only I will have a better time doing much more better things, like you know, going outside. Go get them something like, hot wheels or barbie, not this. Even with its tag of quote unquote, "FREE TO PLAY" if your kid is dumb, then your money is going out of your wallet, no questions. Even if your kid is smart, then they should read the reviews and say, hey, this game is bad, I'm not playing it.\n\nAlso, why do you need a keyboard to play multiplayer, let alone navigate through single player. If your game is for kids, don't try to make them spam the keyboard, and don't let them see the artwork, its not child friendly all the time.\n\nSoundtrack, nothing really to say, I just got the second world, its pretty much the same 15 second loop. Even Bejeweled had a better soundtrack, and its sometimes mute.\n\nCharacters, with pretty much everything, I think Olaf has more appearances then the main character, speaking of which, is that character keeping the frozen cancer is because of that damn tooth.\n\nIn frosty the snowman, do you see a buck tooth on him, no, you don't.\n\nCASE CLOSED\n\n3/10\n\nEDIT: Remember when I talked about that cards? Yeah, um, I don't its worth it, in order to get a card, you must pay 9.99 in microtransactions. AND THE CARDS COST 36 CENTS EACH! DEAR GOD! I  also find that the badge names are long, and can look embarrasing on your profile. I don't have the money to waste on this "GAME" because there is better things I could buy, like you know, a better game, 5 packs of cards that can get me a level 5 badge, a key from Team Fortress 2, or here is something better, THERAPY!\n\nI need therapy for how much things this game got wrong. There is no snowball fight, there is no fun, there is no cutscenes, they could of done something better. STOP MILKING IT FROM ALL OF ITS WORTH, LET ALONE YOU GUYS WENT BEYOND THAT!\n\nYou could of done a steam version of Disney Infinity. Think about that next time, would you rather have a good game on steam, or a bad game on steam. I'd pick a good game, because good games DON'T SUCK!

But the fact of the matter remains, its an iOS port to PC. There is no Mouse control like people mention, but its not hard to actually play with your arrow keys, most of the levels are not timed, so It shouldn't actually effect you in anyway. If you look at the image and video on the purchase page, you already know what your signing up for. Its a 'Candy Crush' styled Frozen game. It's not very exciting on the PC, and probably not that thrilling on the phone either, but it's not that bad. Something to mess around with if your bored and litterally have nothing else to do.\n\nEDIT: Playing it a lot more, I've actually found a lot of other issues, mainly being the multiplayer. There isn't really a point to 'pay' for more characters to play in a game where only local multiplayer is offered.\n\nThe game isnt too bad, Its pretty generic and it's nothing to write home about.

Vibrant graphics, amazing UI controls, stunning mechanics, this game is the whole package. This game provides the practice of self control by showing you the characters you COULD buy, but would rather not to. Children these days need to practice self discipline to increase independence, responsibility, and self worth. Not only are these characters unlocked through microtransactions, but they are shown with vibrant colors and interesting gestures making the player feel absorbed into the world of Frozen. These amazing visual effects are the tiny things modern games need, as they provide an overall thrilling experience to the player, resulting in some delicious eye candy. But it doesn't stop there. The amazing orchestral soundtrack is another plus to this already truly beautiful game, as the melody provides a melifluous, enthralling sound to help the player feel as if he/she are playing in the soft powdery snow. The stunning soundtrack includes about 3 different songs, looping about every ten seconds to clearly portray the mesmerizing experience of winter. The game made me feel like I was a child in the winter again, hot chocolate with Jumbo Marshmallows, fireplace roaring, smell of delicious sweets being baked, and seeing the smiling snowmen outside my bedroom window. If I were to describe the atmosphere of the game in one word, I'd choose, "Captivating."\n\nNow, the game holds many different hypnotic (In a good way) features that engross the player into living the "Winter Wonderland." The mechanics aren't complex, and very easy to learn: Using the arrow keys, match 3 or more of the same color/type to clear it off the board. The basic instructions make it easy for a player to jump into the game, and almost instantly begin improving player skill. The elementary mechanics allows the player to waste very little time learning how to play, and spend more acutally PLAYING the game. After that, the player is free to learn/play whatever they want, and set goals for themselves. For example, once you learn how to play, the game quickly transitions you into gradually progressingly difficult stages. These stages allow quick thinking and cognitive excercises to help train that funny thing inside your head. Now here's the best part. Ever find yourself really tense, agitated, and anxious? Well, once you go through your MANY attempts (Or "Hearts" in this case), they provide a 30 minute life regen time. Now what does this do, you ask, well patience of course! The simplicity of this game along with it's relaxing atmosphere and gameplay makes it a wonderful stress reliever after work, school, and stressful moments. This is why I love this game.\n\nFrozen Free Fall Snowball Fight is a game worthy of my Library, and I highly recommend it.\n\nBut in all seriousness, don't get this game. It needs a TON of work.","September 28, 2015","true","9.7"," 44 of 85 people (52%) found this review helpful 52 people found this review funny","52","44","85","52","8"

Let's beat it!" - First levels as easy as you'd expect from a game directed at children. Emphasizes how your first one or two bonuses are free, buying more works with microtransactions of real money. Before you fail you're always encouraged to buy more time/moves with said bonuses. As the difficulty rises, it feels more like Pay2Win.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nMultiplayer is only local (wasd+space versus arrows+enter) and unlocking the playable opponents depends on singleplayer or real money, for me it just stopped syncing with the rest of the game so I cannot play unlocked characters and my played games count doesn't increase.\n\nSingleplayer gets way more challenging at level 30 until the point around 40 that I'm pretty sure the chances of beating a level are entirely dependent on the RNG creating and feeding the level. If someone was to hypothetically pay all the bonuses you'd need to finish every level without failing, that could easily result in thousands spent while the randomness is still involved. Should the Disney brand be judged by this game alone, departments would get fired and investigations might be started.\n\nUPDATE 2:\n\nThe characters for multiplayer and singleplayer are unlocked separately in singleplayer. There, half their purpose seems to be pointing at their bonus skill suggestively. (I'm still talking about the kind of bonus that must be paid for with real money once all free samples / daily prizes are used up.) The new mouse support occasionally seems to misinterpret input so if you have no time limit, better stay with the keyboard.","September 17, 2015","false","203.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The microtransactions on the iPad version are pretty annoying but you leave it for a while and come back and play when your hearts (lives) have regenerated. That's fine. That would be fine on PC too if that's what happens (although a true free to play would have been even better) but there's no mouse control! You have to use the arrow keys and spacebar! Sure the levels have a move limit instead of a time limit, which means you can spend time stuffing around with the arrow keys, but I'm pretty sure some levels are timed and I think using the keyboard for these levels will cause a lot of frustration.\n\nIf you want to play this game and have an Apple device, go download it from the app store and don't bother with this PC version!","September 17, 2015","false","0.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's an alright Match 3/Bejeweled type of game, but the lack of music from the movie, rather poor graphics and last but not least constant pushing to spend money sour it. Especially can't recommend it for kids, since it's very easy to accidentally go into the shop or get stuck in the game and feel forced/tempted to spend money.

Also, Disney adding mouse support.\n\nWhat I did not like: The idea of in-game purchases being mostly one-time use items, save for multiplayer characters. Daily reward makes up for that by giving store items for free each day.\n\nMy recommendation: I think Frozen fans will enjoy this one, personally, I have fun playing this cute game.","December 11, 2015","true","24.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I thought as I unfolded the secrets of Frozen. The game teaches you about the lore of the Frozen Universe hidden between the crushing of gems and the scoring of points. Anyways, after I click on Play Game, I was brought to a new screen. Single-player, or multi-player? Which one will  I choose next?  A click em' up game with a multiplayer?! Truly a sign of a masterpiece. Since my "friends" are on vacation, I clicked single player. I forgot to mention the immersive music that played in the backround which helped me enter the world of Frozen. The game brought me into a new screen, which brought me into the main game. It lifted my soul to see the child on the left side of the screen clapping and dancing, for what reason? I don't know, but he was there as I learned to slide the gems, left, right, up and down, scoring thousands and milllions of points throughout my journey...my destiny.","September 18, 2015","false","0.4"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","55","6","11","6","0"

Strange right? If you don't have a gamepad laying around you'll have to get used to using the arrow and space keys for movement.\n\nThe game itself is actually alright playing a lot like bejeweled. You match colored tiles and rack up points. Some levels are just straight up beat a score. And other levels have objectives like clear a number of colored tiles or special tiles and sometimes a mix of both score and objective.\nSo there is variety and fun to be had here.\n\nBut since this game is an obvious moble port you get to have all the fun that comes with that.\nThe fun being micro transactions. To play a stage you need to have lives. Lose a stage lose a life. That is fine. However there is no real way to earn extra guys that I have seen so far other than getting a few for a daily bonus log in. Of course there is a store to purchase extra lives. We'll get to that in a second.\nThere are also power ups to use while playing. Which does add some fun. The game gives you a few free ones to try out as you play. Of course when you get the power ups the game urges you to use them right away. Out of power ups now?\nNo problem, just like extra lives you can by power ups in the store.\n\nLets talk about this store now. The store has all type of things for sale. Lives, power ups, and even characters.\nThe prices are gross. By that I mean one life cost one dollar. Power ups? One dollar per power up. Characters cost three dollars to unlock. Now by playing I have unlocked Hans... but really who wants to play as that guy? Don't know if you can unlock all characters by playing or not. If you can I'll be sure to update saying so.\n\nThe game plays alright and I have not run into any bugs yet. I can't give this game a recommendation because of the obvious cash grab. Sure the game is simple enough and I have gone through fifteen levels so far without losing. But to be honest this game is marketed for children. And I can see them spamming power ups and running out of lives rather quickly and then asking their parents to pay for more of everything including asking for their favorite characters.\nIf you really want a fun match three type of game and don't already own Bejeweled 3 (one of the best match three type games in my opinion) I would have to recommend giving a look or purchasing Tomb of Tyrants, Hunie Pop (not for children), and 4 Elements. If you don't have the cash to buy a new game at the moment there is a free to play game called Battle for Blood - Epic Battles within thirty seconds. Now there is a bit of a grind in that game since it is free to play. But, there is no time restriction or need to purchase anything to beat the game.\n\nThanks for taking the time to read this review. Have a pleasant day.","September 15, 2015","false","1.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Strange right? If you don't have a gamepad laying around you'll have to get used to using the arrow and space keys for movement.\n\nThe game itself is actually alright playing a lot like bejeweled. You match colored tiles and rack up points. Some levels are just straight up beat a score. And other levels have objectives like clear a number of colored tiles or special tiles and sometimes a mix of both score and objective.\nSo there is variety and fun to be had here.\n\nBut since this game is an obvious moble port you get to have all the fun that comes with that.\nThe fun being micro transactions. To play a stage you need to have lives. Lose a stage lose a life. That is fine. However there is no real way to earn extra guys that I have seen so far other than getting a few for a daily bonus log in. Of course there is a store to purchase extra lives. We'll get to that in a second.\nThere are also power ups to use while playing. Which does add some fun. The game gives you a few free ones to try out as you play. Of course when you get the power ups the game urges you to use them right away. Out of power ups now?\nNo problem, just like extra lives you can by power ups in the store.\n\nLets talk about this store now. The store has all type of things for sale. Lives, power ups, and even characters.\nThe prices are gross. By that I mean one life cost one dollar. Power ups? One dollar per power up. Characters cost three dollars to unlock. Now by playing I have unlocked Hans... but really who wants to play as that guy? Don't know if you can unlock all characters by playing or not. If you can I'll be sure to update saying so.\n\nThe game plays alright and I have not run into any bugs yet. I can't give this game a recommendation because of the obvious cash grab. Sure the game is simple enough and I have gone through fifteen levels so far without losing. But to be honest this game is marketed for children. And I can see them spamming power ups and running out of lives rather quickly and then asking their parents to pay for more of everything including asking for their favorite characters.\nIf you really want a fun match three type of game and don't already own Bejeweled 3 (one of the best match three type games in my opinion) I would have to recommend giving a look or purchasing Tomb of Tyrants, Hunie Pop (not for children), and 4 Elements. If you don't have the cash to buy a new game at the moment there is a free to play game called Battle for Blood - Epic Battles within thirty seconds. Now there is a bit of a grind in that game since it is free to play. But, there is no time restriction or need to purchase anything to beat the game.\n\nThanks for taking the time to read this review. Have a pleasant day.","September 15, 2015","false","1.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The graphics are also weirdly low res and blurry.\n\nOther than that, Frozen Free Fall is everything that makes Candy Crush a horrible game (except for the plagiarized art assets, there's none of that here):      Timed lives/credits/energy\nCompletely luck based on the later levels (unless you use purchased power-ups).\nExtremely repetitive; the description boasts "195 FREE levels" as if making levels for this game is some sort of achievement\nShort. I didn't obviously finish the game, but I played ~45 minutes and  reached level 20. Extrapolate from that and if you just straight up purchase the "needed" power-ups and blast through the bland, unimaginative levels of this "game" in 5 hours\nThe effects and icons aren't intuitive at all. Appart from the horizontal and vertical clearing ones, I had trouble remembering which of the nondescript decorations on the block was which.\nAll in all this game is very derivative, but doesn't even do that well. If you wan't a better free match-three puzzle, there are plenty available on Steam, and if you don't mind paying a few bucks for one, you can just get Bejeweled and play the good one.","September 16, 2015","false","0.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BasherGaming/recommended/357480/","BasherGaming","Basher Gaming","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BasherGaming/","102 products in account","The fire crackled, radiating against the couple’s skin, creating an angelic glow around their intimacy. Letting out a content sigh, Anna rested her head on her husband’s masculine shoulder, nuzzling it slightly. In reaction to her gesture, Kristoff put his arm around her and gave her shoulder a squeeze.\n\nIt was hard to believe that the royal couple was celebrating their 5th wedding anniversary. Such a special occasion caused for an equally special celebration. Kristoff had decided to surprise Anna with a trip to their cabin where they had shared their first night together as husband and wife. Seclusion and a warm fire: the perfect mixture for romance, as Anna had put it.\n\n“This is so nice.” Anna murmured, breaking the silence. “The fire, the quiet. It’s nice.”\n\nKristoff pressed his lips in her strawberry hair. “Just nice? Is there something I’m missing?”\n\nPulling her lips into a smirk, Anna glanced back to her husband. “No. I’ve just been thinking about Kristian.” She looked out the window, exposed to blankets of snow coating the earth, thinking about her three year old back at home in the castle. “We usually aren’t away from him. Not this far, at least.”\n\n“Oh, don’t worry about him. He’s a brave boy.” Kristoff reassured, rubbing Anna’s bare shoulders.\n\nA ‘hmm’ escaped Anna’s mouth. “Just like his daddy.”\n\n“Besides,” Kristoff said in a husky voice laced with lust. “It’s just us right now. And unlike being at home,” Scooping her petite body in his broad arms, Kristoff placed Anna gently on the carpeted floor and hovered above her, supporting himself on his hands. Anna roared in laughter as she placed her hands on the chest above her. “We can be as loud as we want to out here.” He whispered with a devilish smirk.\n\nRetorting the grin, Anna pressed her rosy lips to his slightly chapped ones, arching her back so that their stomachs met. Kristoff’s tongue took dominance, as it glided along her pearly teeth, savoring her taste. They moaned into each other’s mouths, a little a first, gaining volume when their kiss intensified.\n\nAnna was the first to pull away, sitting back up straight, Kristoff soon following.\n\nWith a deflated look on his face, Kristoff pouted. “Why’d you stop?”\n\n“I need to take this off, silly.” Anna teased lowering the thin straps of her light blue dress further down her shoulders. She turned her back to him. “How about you help me.”\n\nGrinning, Kristoff caressed his wife’s nimble shoulders, her skin as soft as a first snow. They crept down to her back as he began to work the intricate laces of her corset, having become more experienced with ‘helping Anna out of her clothes’ for the past five years. As they loosened enough, Kristoff slowly pulled the cage over her head, exposing the final layer of her clothes.\n\nIn return, Anna eased Kristoff out of his shirt, adoring his rippling muscles as they continued the kiss. She ran her small hands up and down his naked chest, Kristoff mimicking the behavior on her back. As his lust for her grew, Kristoff took an ice-harvesting worn hand and grabbed her breast, giving it a gentle squeeze. Anna jumped a bit at first, but didn’t pull away. She merely let her hands slide down to the waistline of his black trousers and stroked his manhood from underneath the fabric causing him to moan at contact.\n\nFilled with passion, the couple removed the rest of their clothes: Anna tossing her skirt and undershirt aside, and Kristoff kicking off his pants. Both admired one another in the flesh.\n\nKristoff was engulfed by her beauty. She had filled out ever so slightly after bearing a child, her breasts a bit larger, and her hips at a perfect thickness. Her creamy skin was splattered with freckles, even in her most intimate areas. She glowed with a unique kind of fire, composed of lust and excitement, only enhancing his growing desire. As his eyes trailed down her naked figure, he reached a patch of coarse auburn locks that created a path to her precious, pink sex.\n\nAnna, too, had adored her husband’s nakedness, becoming wet in the region between her curvy thighs. From his smooth blond hair on his head, to the trial from his stomach to his lovely manhood, Anna treasured every inch of his beautifully sculpted body.\n\nThis time, Anna pushed Kristoff to the ground and spreading herself on top of him, her nipples pressing into his chest. As their lips embraced once again, the ice master’s hand stroked the princess’s thigh and buttocks.\n\nFinally, Kristoff’s  desire became too great to ignore as it began to press between their abdomen. Anna mounted her mountain man, his hand running along her slit that was crying with want. She shivered and gazed down at him with desire pouring into her blue orbs.\n\n“Are you ready for me?” he asked with a sexy husk.\n\nAnna smirked and took his length in her hand, his great size making her palm look so small. “I was born ready.” She flirted while batting her eyes.\n\nSlowly, Anna eased herself onto Kristoff’s erection, and he tenderly pushed into her fleshy folds. As her inner walls enveloped his length, both gasped in unison as they became one in the flesh. Anna’s tightness and wetness caused Kristoff to toss his head back and involuntarily buck his hips further into her.\n\nAnna’s lips contorted into an ‘o’ shape, a whimper slipping through her mouth. She then began to raise her hips up and down, bringing Kristoff’s ♥♥♥♥♥ in and out of her. Kristoff arched his lower region up and down, syncopating with his wife’s motions. Their speed began to increase just as their volume did, a chorus of ‘ohs’ and ‘ahs’ rising from the bundle of naked bliss on the floor.\n\nKristoff sat up so that Anna rested on his lap. He began to pepper kisses along her craned neck, and gently played with her breasts, allowing the nipple to dwindle along the grooves of his fingers. Anna moaned and pulled his face into her bosom, coursing her fingers through his blond locks. Using her thighs as leverage, Kristoff began to thrust deeper inside of her cervix, hitting her g spot each time he pulled out.\n\n“Oh God, Kristoff!” Anna chanted, her voice climbing a few octaves higher.\n\nKristoff ate up her squeals of pleasure, longing to make her beg for more. He loved how he made her feel this way, equally how she made him feel. “Oh, Anna.” He gasped, dazed by the ecstasy.\n\nIn one swift movement, Kristoff lowered Anna so that her back was on the floor. He hung above her lovely and bare frame, his large muscles embracing her.\n\nAnna eagerly redirected Kristoff’s length back to her beseeching opening. He slid back into her, and stifled a groan as her warm folds lapped against him. Inching closer and closer to their climaxes, Kristoff draped Anna’s legs over his shoulders and commenced to thrust into her.\n\nAnna tossed her arms back as her breasts bounced with each thrust. “Oh, Kristoff! I-I’m gonna-“ Anna stammered, balling her hands into fists.\n\nKristoff’s cheeks turned a red hue as he felt a familiar pressure in his lower abdomen. Wanting to satisfy his wife’s hunger, he thumbed her sensitive nub right above her opening. She gasped sharply at the contact, and flung her arms around his neck. With one final push against her g spot, Anna wailed his name in ♥♥♥♥♥♥ic bliss, her juices coating his stiff erection.\n\nHer inner walls clenched around his shaft, introducing the familiar pressure. Anna’s exiting climatic trembles triggered Kristoff’s ♥♥♥♥♥♥, and he roared as he released his seed deep inside her womb.\n\nPanting heavily, the couple collapsed on the floor, dazed by their climaxes. Anna rolled on top of her husband’s body, both covered in beads of sweat.","September 16, 2015","false","0.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

The graphics are also weirdly low res and blurry.\n\nOther than that, Frozen Free Fall is everything that makes Candy Crush a horrible game (except for the plagiarized art assets, there's none of that here):      Timed lives/credits/energy\nCompletely luck based on the later levels (unless you use purchased power-ups).\nExtremely repetitive; the description boasts "195 FREE levels" as if making levels for this game is some sort of achievement\nShort. I didn't obviously finish the game, but I played ~45 minutes and  reached level 20. Extrapolate from that and if you just straight up purchase the "needed" power-ups and blast through the bland, unimaginative levels of this "game" in 5 hours\nThe effects and icons aren't intuitive at all. Appart from the horizontal and vertical clearing ones, I had trouble remembering which of the nondescript decorations on the block was which.\nAll in all this game is very derivative, but doesn't even do that well. If you wan't a better free match-three puzzle, there are plenty available on Steam, and if you don't mind paying a few bucks for one, you can just get Bejeweled and play the good one.","September 16, 2015","false","0.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This game delivers. It brings 2015 graphical fidelity into the movie themed game play, optimized extremely well for all computers, Audio is top notch with a custom soundtrack that makes you want to keep playing. On the contrary though, there were some very minor flaws. I felt like the game deserves mouse navigation through the menus and settings to change the individual graphical prompts. This game made me cry of joyous tears as I played through the amazing campain with very complex character development and captivating nudity in the story of the game. I would give this game 9.5 out of 10 satanic demons.","September 15, 2015","true","0.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","1","4","0","0"

It's a casual game. A bejeweled clone. A bejeweled clone with Disney elements. As per usual for phone app's it has microtransactions (normally when it comes to lives and powerups) allowing the game to be presented for free. If you don't like bejeweled or Disney then this is not the game for you. If you like either one of those give it a shot, it's free. Also contrary to what previous reviewers think Microtransactions are completely optional.\n\nNext people are complaining about mouse control (understandable since it is PC) but fail to comment on how easy it currently is without a mouse to play this game. Spacebar is Enter, Arrow Keys to move around, ESC to go back. Plus they remind you of the controls on nearly every page. IMO you don't need a mouse whatsoever. But they will be adding that (and Enter key functionality) sometime soon.\n\nFor a phone to PC port the game functions fairly well. The screens load nice and quickly. The graphics have also been adapted nicely that they look like they belong on the PC. Though they are also not the best of the best.\n\nTLDR: Its a cute little game that functions well but is nothing we haven't seen before. If you want to play a casual game of bejeweled that also has Disney characters then give this a shot. It's free and honestly try it before you diss it.","September 18, 2015","true","0.4"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","20","1","5","0","0"

The majority of the game takes place in war-stricken Afghanistan, a desolate and barren wasteland torn between military mercenaries and armed insurgents. You play as Captain Elsa McTavish, an American Forces Captain turned renegade after the loss of your dog 'Boner' in a midnight raid gone wrong.\nThe game claims to be open world but really this is a facade, in fact you spend all of your time in closed mission areas or a main base from which you can move out. The missions themselves usually consist of taking out military targets by force or by capture, and a few have driving sections at the beginning or end which can provide a frantic and thrilling chase. The vehicle mechanics are good but unfortunately the thing that lets this game down is the FPS element itself.\nI have to say in my experience that combat just did not feel satisfying. There is a gratuitous amount of gore in this game which although realistic could be a bit over the top. The 18 rating is justified as often things come down to hand-to-hand combat, with Elsa using knives, hammers or even mislaid pens as deadly weapons.\nAnother important part of the game is the 'interrogation' mechanic. Sometimes to progress in a mission Elsa will take a hostage and question them for information, letting you use the environment as a weapon with which to torture your captive. The way the dialogue unwinds here is quite subtle and believable, the intense story being very well written, and smashing out somebody's teeth on a urinal to find out what they know somehow manages to retain the atmosphere of drama without seeming too funny or out of place.\n\nOverall the game is a massive improvement on Frozen : Reckoning, but in the end it can never bring the series back to the glory of Frozen II. I'd recommend this if you want a game that's casual in terms of difficulty but still carries a heavy plot. Otherwise you'd be better sticking with the previous iterations.","October 15, 2015","true","0.7"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

The lack of mouse support is a bit off putting but so far it is a game about number of moves and not time.  So, using the keyboard isn't really a problem.  Though mouse support would be nice as it would be much more natural.  My biggest complaint is it takes several screens to exit the game.  You can just hit escape and then say yes.  You have to go through this process on several screens.","September 15, 2015","true","0.4"," 5 of 14 people (36%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","36","5","14","2","0"

I only wish you could've used your mouse instead of the keyboard, but I don't mind using the keyboard. And I don't understand why everyone is complaining. This is a free to play game and you only have an amount of hearts to use, and if you ran out of hearts you just need to wait for the game to fill more hearts.

Should not we all be respectful to other gamers, and their heinous choices?\n\nSo what if this may open an irreparable windfall of other terrible mobile ports which will saturate the market home page?\n\nI think we should all take a step back and realize that this may be a great step forward for steam. Perhaps Valve will begin to work on projects similar to this one instead of wasting time on games that no one will play, such as Left 4 Dead 3, Portal 3, Team Fortress 3, a new Counter-Strike, or, of course, the ridiculous Half-Life 3. This may be one of the best and most important games on the Steam Market ever!

The "power-ups" are introduced on a level to try each one, but you never get to use them afterwards (unless you pay for them).\nAbsolutely one of the worst UI interfaces for a PC game.  Everything is keyboard driven, including moving through the menus.  Not mouse interface of any kind, and you can't remap any of the keys.\nThe multiplayer is "shared keyboard" only, and they don't even tell you what the keyboard commands are for each person.\n(Edit: A recent patch now allows a mouse interface.  Even with that, it requires two clicks to move backwards through the menu selection system.  The first click to say "Go back" and a second click for "Are you sure?".

So you buy stuff. And if you don't pay attention, soon you'll be paying way more than this game is worth.\n\nPersonally I've tried to get as far as I could, buying as few objects as possible (for about 5 € in total and yes, I am ashamed) and now I'm stuck in Level 32 which always has the same order of gems.\nEverytime I lose a level or just discontinue I get told that I lose a life. And somehow I always have 5 lives, they won't get fewer. Is it a bug? Well anyway, at least the pressure about buying lives (yes, you also buy lives) is not there.\n\nSo this is what pretty much ruins the fun.\nWhy couldn't the developers say "You know what: Pay us a few bucks and you get a fun game which does not suck more money out of you"?\nOh yeah, THEN they would not get a piece themselves of the cash cow that is "Frozen".\n\nI love playing games like "Bejeweled" but this one I cannot recommend or play much more of it. Screw "free" pay to win games.","December 30, 2015","false","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Your lives are limited to 5 and restore very slowly, all special abilities are gained either through getting them in your daily drop or, again, buying it from the shop.\nAlso, as far as I can say, shop works outside of steam, so that means you will be handing money to somebody else, with all security risks that come from it.\n\nOverall: just a mobile game that didn't really needed to come to Steam. There are much better titles out there that won't outrage you with greedy micro-transactions.\n\nP.S.: It seems like difficulty wasn't adjusted for timed levels, which makes it nigh-impossible to get 3 stars on them using keyboard.","September 19, 2015","false","66.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The world of Frozen Free Fall: Snowball Fight. Nervously clicking the play button I started the first level, euphoria was all around me. I was as excited as a bunny getting molested by your dogs dead corpse. All of a sudden I saw a spider out of the corner of my eye. As quickly as I could I typed in Google "How to kill a spider, for wimps." I clicked the first forum I saw, scrolling to the bottem I saw those words "Grab your Febreeze bottle and spray the spider until it turns into eyelash hairs!" I proceeded to follow the directions. I was too late however, the spider jumped onto my arm. I sprayed him down with my Febreeze bottle but he chomped on my arm before I could mow him down. I knew I was going to turn into a spider, thats what happens when it bites you. I quickly went on my computer again and searched up how to stop the transformation. The forum read "Read the Frozen Free Fall lore!" At that momment I ran upstairs to my secret safe. I opened it up and moved all the stacks of money in it to reach my prized possesion, The Frozen Free Fall lore! I blew off the dust and opened it up to page 7. At that momment the transformation stopped. In short, this game is one of the best games out there. It saved many lives in its past including mine. This game also cured my autism and lead me out of depression. At my ripe old age of 6 billion years old I look back at this game and remember all the great times I had with it, and all the things it has done for me!","September 19, 2015","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","3"

Frozen Free Fall: Snowball Fight  was originally released back in 2013 and was then boasting the newly developed, highly flexible and powerful Unity Engine, it then became an instant classic by making good use of new technology, excellent storytelling, gameplay mechanics and an unrivaled online experience. Alongside its predecessor, both games left a lasting impression, particularly on the FPS genre, as an industry standard for future FPS games to come.\n\nFrozen Free Fall: Snowball Fight puts the player once more behind the thick-framed bulletproof glasses of Elsa , an MIT Graduate of Thermal Physics with an uncanny ability to wield Ice and the person indirectly responsible for freezing the world and exposing Earth to an ice age that is to be known as  'Elsa's Rampage'. Frozen Free Fall: Snowball Fight is set 20 years after the events of Bad Rats and the world is now under the full control of the 'Ice', an interdimensional empire that is currently freezing the natural resources of Earth including the human race which is now close to extinction.\n\nEnter Arendale and step once more into a freezing dress and discover a dystopian future where the only hope of humanity is a small pocket of resistance that refuses to bow down to the Ice rule. Meet old friends as well as establish new ones, explore a vast post-apocalyptic world, fight through impossible odds and stand as the last orange beacon of hope for humanities stand against extinction.","September 20, 2015","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/geekaseltzer/recommended/357480/","geekaseltzer","GeekaSeltzer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/geekaseltzer/","311 products in account","Played this gem of a match-3 on iphone for a few weeks and enjoyed it without paying a penny, though it tended to get a little tedious as levels progressed.  But it's a good family game and since my gaming rig has a touch screen I thought I'd give it a try on PC.  With an XBox-style controller in hand I fire up the game, controller recognized I proceed with gameplay - no surprises, nice.\n\nNow time to try playing without controllers.  What? Neither mouse nor touch support under windows? (Stupifying considering how many of us gamers prefer KB & mouse over a controller!)  Controller support is just fine, but if you don't have one then you'll have to use the cursor keys to navigate the menus, as well as the actual game board.  This reminds me of early arcade games like Tetris.  Spacebar is the select/enter key.  So with no controller it's KB-only gameplay, not horrible but not 2015 either.  Hopefully touch screen and mouse support are in development as the game deserves it.\n\nApart for that, given the nickel & dimey nature of the game I wonder if there's going to be much of a market for this type of game on steam.  The play and graphics are pretty good, at least I thought so under iOS.  But the idea of liking it enough to splurge on perks to improve gameplay, well, it's like perpetual DLC.  This penny-bleeding model seems to work in the personal device marketplace so why not here??\n\nBottom line:  Unfortunately I regret installing Frozen Free Fall: Snowball Fight on PC, even with its small footprint.  It may be okay for tablets and smartphones, but not so much for a PC rig in its present form unless one has a controller (or two for multiplayer).  With mouse and/or touch support I might reinstall it and try it again.  But for now I'm putting this kiddie game to bed.","September 17, 2015","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Nobody has to pay anything. That's simply a shortcut if anyone optionally chooses to. I haven't spent a cent on the majority of "mobile games" with microtransactions (including the supposedly sinister microtransactions of Final Fantasy: All The Bravest or Candy Crush), because it refreshes without having to pay anything.\nI have never had to pay to play whatsoever, it is purely there for an optional shortcut (which people DO have the right to use if they wish to).\n\nSecondly, the claim that it's only controller support. False. I opened it *just* to see what all the fuss was about and was playing with a keyboard just fine. Arrow keys and space bar, really isn't that hard.\n\nIn conclusion, limited lives isn't anything that bad. It's called limiting play. Taking regular breaks from games should be obvious. And you also *earn* lives from playing, I literally gained two extra ones by selecting 1 square out of 9 choices (a daily play selection. You're complaining about something not being in the game when it very clearly is. And you can easily bank up lives for free as well. Again, never had to pay a cent in a free mobile game, and I highly doubt I'm going to start now.\n\nIt's rather sad when the supposed "self-entitled hardcore gamers" of this generation of gaming are actually *more* childish and immature than the kids this game was more likely designed for.

It's... Fun for a kid I suppose? For everyone else, I'd recommend avoiding this game, unless your little one is tugging at your arm and dragging you to the computer to play it, in which case you have my deepest sympathies and you aren't the only one that will or has endured this.\n\nPros:\nGraphics, they're good. Surprisingly good, actually. This is maybe the only positive thing I can think of without sarcasm.\nThe Exit Button.\nIt's "Free."\nThe music isn't blaring "Let it go" on repeat.\n\nCons:\nI had to play every single game with horrifying looking children staring and clapping at me whenever I did something. It was really unnerving.\nNo mouse support.\nMicrotransactions, boy are there a lot of them.\nThe option menu is tiny. And I mean tiny. Like 2 options and a back button tiny.\nIt's overall just a reskin of Candy Crush. And I never liked Candy Crush to begin with.\n\nLet this game go (pun intended) from your steam library and your computer, it's not worth keeping. Besides, if you've got a little kid they'll probably just abuse the microtranscations until your bank comes a-calling.","September 16, 2015","false","0.4"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

As a always, the first levels start out reasonably beatable, then after some you'll be at the mercy of lady luck to get the blocks that you need in order to beat the level, but it's still doable. After that levels become a money-grab, literally.\n\nYou'll be presented with levels, that task you with clearing all immovable blocks which you can only do if you build a combo touching them (frozen solid) or incorporating them (frozen solid with certain color inside), while still maintaining a move limit while ALSO the field is seperated with arbitrary lines, so can only get them from a certain direction  or using a combo that you need to make on the other side of the field to to clear them.  With the move limit, you often would need to clear 2 to 3 blocks with each single move which is unlikely.\n\nThat's where the special powers come in: the characters have somewhat useful special abilities, that let you overcome this near to impossible situations, yet you get only a limited amount of them. If you run out of them there's two ways to get them back: the ingame shop (real money) or waiting another day to have the chance at some chose-1-of-9-game and maybe earn one(!) charge. Charges for special abilites are shared between all the characters, so in combination with levels that require them to be used you'll be running out of them rather quickly. And should you have the audacity to be wanting to reach 3 stars in each level, that will cost you a lot, because stars are bound to score - the score is bound to the matches you make in your move limit. Special powers are not decreasing your move limit, thus making it easier to get matches. And yet the moment you surpass the requirements for a level, the game automatically ends the level, having your remaining turns clear some parts of the board at random - which can result in a higher or lower score based on luck, so you'll find yourself replaying the same level that you need to use powers on over and over again just to get screwed by some missing points at the end, because the randomness just didn't want to give them to you and left you at 2/3 stars.\n\nSo my verdict: stay away, play something else.","September 18, 2015","false","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If so, you may enjoy this retread of the tired match-3-or-more "puzzler".  I put that in quotes because like most games of its ilk, the first 15 levels or so are painfully easy.  After that, though, artificial "challenges" are added that don't require skill as much as they require the game to supply the player with the right gems... er, I mean "ice crystals" at the right time to win.  But hey, it helps them sell more powerups, right?  That's what this is really about, after all, selling additional tokens to put into the slot mach... I mean, game.  All of this for the right to bask in the world of Frozen.  This includes music that is nice at the beginning, but after 5 minutes the loop will make you want cavitate your own head or WORSE... sing "Do You Want to Build A Snowman?"\n\nThe funniest part is, I decided to see what they are extorting people for the privilege to win by checking the power-up "store".  I selected an item, the Steam menu opened, I backed out of the transaction, switched back to the game and it wouldn't let me quit out of the store.  So there I am.  At the store.  All the while it beckons "We can't let you leave...  you must BUY buy buy..."  Alt-F4 fixed that, thankfully.\n\n\nIf this is already installed on your machine, then Alt-F4 and "Uninstall" might be the best move with this piece of crap.    If you haven't installed it, save tje megabytes and do something... anything... productive instead.  If you havfe a family member, young one or friend that likes Frozen, I beg of you hide this from their sight.  The world will be a better place.","September 18, 2015","false","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gameplay is wholly banal. It doesn't even support mouse controls. The only redeeming factor is the quality of the character models, but you won't see more than 3 of them without breaking the bank on micro-transactions. This game is an expression of disrespect and utter contempt for fans of Disney and Frozen.","September 20, 2015","false","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The world of Frozen Free Fall: Snowball Fight. Nervously clicking the play button I started the first level, euphoria was all around me. I was as excited as a bunny getting molested by your dogs dead corpse. All of a sudden I saw a spider out of the corner of my eye. As quickly as I could I typed in Google "How to kill a spider, for wimps." I clicked the first forum I saw, scrolling to the bottem I saw those words "Grab your Febreeze bottle and spray the spider until it turns into eyelash hairs!" I proceeded to follow the directions. I was too late however, the spider jumped onto my arm. I sprayed him down with my Febreeze bottle but he chomped on my arm before I could mow him down. I knew I was going to turn into a spider, thats what happens when it bites you. I quickly went on my computer again and searched up how to stop the transformation. The forum read "Read the Frozen Free Fall lore!" At that momment I ran upstairs to my secret safe. I opened it up and moved all the stacks of money in it to reach my prized possesion, The Frozen Free Fall lore! I blew off the dust and opened it up to page 7. At that momment the transformation stopped. In short, this game is one of the best games out there. It saved many lives in its past including mine. This game also cured my autism and lead me out of depression. At my ripe old age of 6 billion years old I look back at this game and remember all the great times I had with it, and all the things it has done for me!","September 19, 2015","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","3"

Frozen Free Fall: Snowball Fight  was originally released back in 2013 and was then boasting the newly developed, highly flexible and powerful Unity Engine, it then became an instant classic by making good use of new technology, excellent storytelling, gameplay mechanics and an unrivaled online experience. Alongside its predecessor, both games left a lasting impression, particularly on the FPS genre, as an industry standard for future FPS games to come.\n\nFrozen Free Fall: Snowball Fight puts the player once more behind the thick-framed bulletproof glasses of Elsa , an MIT Graduate of Thermal Physics with an uncanny ability to wield Ice and the person indirectly responsible for freezing the world and exposing Earth to an ice age that is to be known as  'Elsa's Rampage'. Frozen Free Fall: Snowball Fight is set 20 years after the events of Bad Rats and the world is now under the full control of the 'Ice', an interdimensional empire that is currently freezing the natural resources of Earth including the human race which is now close to extinction.\n\nEnter Arendale and step once more into a freezing dress and discover a dystopian future where the only hope of humanity is a small pocket of resistance that refuses to bow down to the Ice rule. Meet old friends as well as establish new ones, explore a vast post-apocalyptic world, fight through impossible odds and stand as the last orange beacon of hope for humanities stand against extinction.","September 20, 2015","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
