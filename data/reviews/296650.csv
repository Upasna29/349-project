If there's one thing you could've done before you put it on a distribution platform like Steam...\n\nHandling felt clunky. I think having a huge portion of my screen taken up by the tools frustrated me.\n\nIdea seemed kind of cute, but i'm not really captured by it. The puzzling is quite simple at a glance, which clearly gets more complicated but i'm not sure it's a game anyone would spend more than an hour playing. It just reeks of smart phone/tablet market with little care for PC.\n\nMusic was decent enough, fitted the theme well.","July 3, 2014","false","0.1"," 17 of 23 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","17","23","0","0"

Works for me on Windows 7 64-bit. Only 1024x768 and 800x600 resolutions are available but using a 1680x1050 monitor, I didn't think this made it look too bad, the cartoon style graphics work well. At first I was annoyed by the camera not tracking the "jelly train" but there's a button to toggle this on/off, so not an issue.\n\nReminded me a little of vintage Crash Bandicoot on Playstation\n\nGet it in Humble's German Edition bundle, June 2014.","June 6, 2014","true","0.8"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/amdlo/recommended/296650/","amdlo","amdlo112","http://steamcommunity.com/id/amdlo/","611 products in account","This is what I call a game! Fun to play, an awesome graphics, a great atmosphere and simple to control. Your goal is to get a little jelly (or pudding) riding on a rollercoaster car from an entrance to the exit. But watch out! There are plenty of monsters that are trying to scare the little jelly out of his mind! While your car is constantly moving you can manipulate tracks, scare away monsters and place some traps to stop them. The game offers four worlds each containing 12 levels. The difficulty is of great variability from the first easy straight-forward relaxing world to the last one full of complicated and long tracks. All levels are fun and they never get too frustrating but once you finished them there is no replay value (you can collect the vip coupon in every level but you'll probably collect them in the first run). Overall The Great Jitters is entertaining little game with only one bigger drawback being it's short length.\n\nPros:\n-Great cartoon graphics and animations\n-Spooky haunted house sound desing\n-Fun to play\n\nCons:\n-A little bit short\n-The game would greatly benefit from a widescreen resolution (max resolution is 1024x768, but 1280x720 would be ideal so you can see more of the level)\n-Can get slightly repetitive in the last few levels","August 16, 2014","true","4.5"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Resolution doesn't go past 1024 (hello mobile game). Also the gameplay is simple, boring and repetitive.

You can activate special abilities to neutralize monsters. You have to get the jelly to the end.\n\nIt’s fun and easy to get the hang of. It becomes more challenging and complex.
