Until now it has been fruitless. UNTIL NOW. "Ghost Control Inc." provides such an outlet. Part management sim, Part XCOM combat/base strategy, this is a fun little distraction of a game. You name your starting character (My guy is Fat Indiana... you'll know him when you see him) and start your own paranormal cleaning service (I named mine the Ghost Murderers). Time passes as you sit in HQ, upgrading, hiring, firing, and managing equipment - that is until your cell phone rings and your services are required. Then you load up your vehicle, prep your team, and head out; make sure to beat the competition there.\n\nCombat is deceptively simple. Your team opens doors, turns on lights, and encounters nasty ghoulies. Hit them with your lasers until they're worn down and lay down a trap. It's pretty satisfying to wreck ghosts in a fun, lighthearted atmosphere. Your team will suffer physical (and mental) wear-and-tear, so you'll have to swing by the hospital. Your car needs gas, so you'll get that too. And obviously as your business expands, the ghosts will amp up their game. You'll need to buy more equipment and hire new people.\n\nIf you like XCOM, if you're a fan of management games, or if you have fond memories of a certain iconic franchise, I can recommend this wholeheartedly. I've just got one question: who ya gonna call?\n\nPS: Do NOT call the Ghost Murderers, they are highly unprofessional.","June 7, 2014","true","2.0"," 62 of 79 people (78%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","78","62","79","11","0"

This game has a lot of interesting systems and mechanics from weapon upgrades, vehicle upgrades and even base upgrades. There is a lot to do in this game and a lot to see, but most people will probably beat in a week with casual play times, a few days with more dedicated time and for the truly dedicated it could easily be beaten in a day.\n\nAs much as this game is amazing, and especially with additional content currently in limbo as it's been some time since an update, I would only recommend this game at full price to people who are FANS of all genres this game caters to and fans of the Ghost Buster angle. For everyone else, I recommend waiting til this goes on sale.\n\nPersonal Rating: 9/10 (charming pixel graphics, great audio, good controls, amazing game play and content.)\nUnbiased Rating: 7/10 (short "campaign", aka list of objectives, buggy achievements, unsure future for the game, steep-ish price for the amount of current content.)\n\nAlso, my biggest gripe with this game is how ridiculously overpriced the emotes are, I want to collect them all!","July 28, 2015","true","19.5"," 29 of 31 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","29","31","0","2"

Great music despite not having any of the actual tracks from the movie and the gameplay of running a "Ghost Control" business was fun. The only catch is that there isn't much meat to the gameplay either in terms of running the business or capturing ghosts. But it's a great foundation and something that I hope we see developed further or get a fully fleshed out sequel from.","June 10, 2014","true","8.5"," 27 of 30 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","27","30","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/genoforprez/recommended/280540/","genoforprez","genoforprez","http://steamcommunity.com/id/genoforprez/","385 products in account","In a nutshell, what you're basically looking at with Ghost Control is not so much a business simulation game but something more akin to an X-COM with a ghostbusters theme. Just like X-COM, you have to manage and upgrade your HQ, but the HQ management doesn't really require much careful decision making or strategy. It's more like just waiting until you have enough money to purchase a thing and then purchasing it. So there is base management, but it's not complex enough to really feel like a true business sim, and it's frankly not even as complex as the base management in X-COM.\n\nYou're going to be doing a lot of tactical battles in this game, and this is another area where the game is basically similar to X-COM but a lot more simplified. You have 2 action points per turn, you fire ranged weapons that have a certain % chance to hit or not based on the particular character's aim stat, and your objective is always to eliminate all ghosts. Where it is different from X-COM is that there are pretty much only two weapons at your disposal: beam guns and traps. However the guns can have different effects (e.g. pushing enemies back, pulling enemies toward you, stunning enemies, multiplying dmg dealt by allies' beams, etc). The traps can also have a range of different perks (e.g. some traps require a ghost to be on the same square, whereas others have an AoE trap effect. Some traps can only be dropped next to you while other traps can be slung a short distance toward the target. Some traps only capture ghosts, while some traps can still stun or dmg a ghost even if failing to capture it, etc).\n\nOne thing that is a notably creative feature of this game that makes it more interesting than X-COM or other similar tactical games is the ghost trapping gameplay. This is a truly original idea that in my opinion is the game's most interesting and defining feature. In a lot of these tactical games where you're controlling squads of dudes with guns, you're usually tasked with shooting all the enemies until they are dead or incapacitated. In Ghost Control, all of your enemies are ghosts, so you can't actually kill them. All you can do is shoot them to reduce their "energy level", which can greatly reduce their mobility if low enough, but it also makes them susceptible to being trapped. Your ghost traps have a "max energy level" requirement, which indicates the max energy level ghost it is able to trap. But lowering the ghost's energy level below this maximum makes the trap more likely to succeed. So what you are trying to do is shoot the ghosts to drop their energy level to 0, then position the ghost over a trap to permanently remove it from the field. But remember how beam weapons have certain effects, such as push/pull? This means you can throw a trap on the ground and hurt a ghost AS YOU ARE PULLING it toward you and onto a trap. Or an ally can throw down a trap and you can use a push-type beam to push the ghost onto an ally's trap. Or you can position a ghost on tap of a trap and hit it with a stun-type beam to prevent it from escaping the trap range and boost the odds of a successful trap. This is pushing/pulling ghosts onto traps to eliminate them is an excellent way of capturing the spirit of ghostbusters in a tactical game, and I commend the designers for thinking of it.\n\nOne kinda negative thing about the combat is that many of the maps are very cramped for space. You'll be fighting ghosts in a lot of houses and offices, and it really limits your tactical options when the hallways or paths around furniture only allow one ally to pass through at a time. Based on conversation with other players, though, it seems that some people enjoy the challenge of having their mobility greatly restricted in this way. Another positive is that it also restricts the mobility of many ghosts (save for a few ghosts that will teleport or phase through walls). So it could be that you'll find that to be a positive, but just know that residential/office levels put you in VERY tight spaces. The designers realized that the residential/office maps are very cramped, though, so as a counterbalance there are also park/tunnel missions that are more about battling in wide open spaces.\n\nThe negative of these tight spaces is not just how it affects gameplay/mobility, though. It also means that there is just a lot of.... STUFF...  piled up on the screen. If you are using the default view on residential/office levels, it can be almost impossible to see your characters or where the possible walking paths are. There is some helpful tools in the game to cope with this. For example, walls and furniture become transparent when the cursor is within a certain range. You can also press shift to turn walls and furniture completely off. So there are ways of dealing with it, but some may still be slightly put off by the default view feeling so cluttered.\n\nIn terms of the flow of the game, it does feel like it starts to run out of steam after several hours. There are objectives to meet, base upgrades to buy, weapon upgrades to buy, and of course the ghosts will become more challenging. But the game sort of has the same problem as The Elder Scrolls, where at some point you realize that the game basically boils down to 1) kill everything in dungeon, 2) sell everything from dungeon, 3) use money made from selling everything in previous dungeon to buy better things that let you kill everything in an even bigger dungeon, 4) repeat times infinity.\n\nIf you love ghostbusters and you love x-com style games, and if you are fine with the old school look/feel, then it may be a game worth checking out.\n\nMy verdict using the criteria below is that the game ranks around a 4..\n\n7) A classic, essential, and/or must-buy game that is worth full price.\n6) A good game that is worth the full price.\n5) A pretty good game worth checking out--especially if discounted.\n4) A pretty good game, but I would recommend buying it discounted.\n3) Worth checking out, but I would recommend buying it heavily discounted.\n2) Only worth checking out if you are dangerously curious.\n1) Avoid at all costs.","November 25, 2015","true","10.7"," 24 of 26 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","24","26","2","2"

The closest game I can think of would be XCOM, but in GhostControl you are running a ghost hunting company (think Ghost Busters) instead of running a secret government agency tasked with defending earth from alien attack.\n\nIn GCE you'll have to manage your team, a base, and your car. You can recruit additional members for your team from your home office and must keep their sanity maintained, periodically visiting a hospital to "repair" that sanity. Your base is where you'll drop off your ghost goo and perform various other tasks. And while out roaming the town waiting for calls from new potential clients, you have to remember to keep the car gassed up with a few gas stations around the town.\n\n*[While the game is actually quite enjoyable from my experiences thus far, there are a couple minor issues that can be frustrating. One such issue is the fact that every time you select a team member for their turn, their inventory screen pops up in the bottom middle of the screen blocking your view (they can be moved and if you remember to move them, and not close them, on your first couple turns it's easily fixed).]\n\n*[Edit: 6/10/2014: This issue has been fixed and I haven't noticed any other real issues]\n\nAll in all though, a very enjoyable game. I'd give it a solid 8/10 from my experience so far.\n\n*[Edit 2: 6/10/2014: As you can see from the comments to this review, the devs care a great deal about their game.

Probably not worth the full sticker price.\n\nGhostControl Inc. is a turn-based small squad tactics game. Very small squad. You never get more than three people in your deployable team, and never wind up clearing any buildings larger than a three-bedroom house. The mechanics for laying and picking up traps is kind of cumbersome, but works in the framework of the game.\n\nThe real thing that the game lacks is a sense of immediecy and danger; even the most gnarly of spectors will take several rounds to force one of your hunters to flee, and even mid-level spooks will themselves take several rounds of concentrated fire from your whole team to deal with. This really reduces what makes most turn-based tactical games exciting, being on-edge while waiting to see what the enemy winds up doing, since it could make or break you.\n\nAlso, many areas have so much stuff scattered over such a small playing area that they are effectively reduced to networks of single-file corridors for movement, which is super frustrating.","December 21, 2014","false","6.9"," 32 of 43 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","32","43","0","0"

The game merges turn-based strategic combat with business management to allow you to run your own ghost hunting business while busting the ghosts with the team you put together. As you advance through the game, you'll be able to upgrade things like your headquarters and vehicle, as well as hire (or fire) new hunters that have different classes (such as shooter, scientist and brawler.) With an upgraded headquarters, you'll be able to pay for training for any of your ghost hunters in order to improve their skill set. The weapons and traps are also upgradeable through research, so you can improve the weapons in your arsenal as well as purchasing new weapons and traps (that can also be upgraded).\n\nA typical mission will start with a call coming in on your phone with someone telling you about their haunting, and you have the option to accept the mission or hang up on the caller. If you accept the mission, a ghost icon will appear on the map where the mission is to take place. You'll need to speed your team over there as quickly as you can, as there are rival ghost hunting businesses in the game that will get there first (if given enough time). This is where the faster vehicles come into play, as they will give you an advantage in speeding to your next mission. If a rival company makes it to the mission location before you, then the mission is cancelled out for you, and you'll have to wait for your next call. Once you arrive at the mission, you and your crew will be responsible for rounding up all the ghosts there using your weapons and traps. If a crew member's 'sanity' stat drops too low, they'll go running from the mission, leaving the rest of your crew to finish cleaning up the haunting. Once you've completed capturing all the ghosts on the premises, you'll want to swing by the hospital to cure any fears (lowered stats) that are affecting your crew, then head back to HQ to store the ghosts. Stored ghost energy can be sold, but you may not want to sell it all, as you'll need some ghost energy (as well as cash) in order to upgrade your weapons and traps.\n\nThe art style is decidedly retro, and does a good job of giving you the feeling of playing the classic "Ghostbusters" game from the old Commodore 64 days. While I'm happy with the advancements we've made in graphics technology since the days of the C64, this is one of those games that brilliantly shows that it is the gameplay, and not the graphics, that really make or break a game. A game can have the prettiest graphics on the planet, but if the gameplay doesn't back it up, then it doesn't make for much of a game. Here, the opposite can be expected. Very old-school styled graphics on top of a great game make it a great game, period.\n\nIt took me a little over 11 hours to complete the game, without rushing through. Fortunately, when the game's 'campaign' is finished, you have the option to keep playing so you can keep on busting ghosts. According to the developer, they have two more cities planned for the future (Cologne and San Francisco), so we can expect more ghost busting fun in the future. They have not specified whether the additional cities will be made freely available or if they'll be paid add-ons, though I would expect the latter, and frankly have no complaint about paying for some add-on cities since the price of admission for the main game is so low to begin with.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend this to anyone who enjoyed the original Ghostbusters game on the Commodore 64, and to anyone who enjoys a game with a solid retro vibe that is a good blend of turn-based strategy and business management.","June 12, 2014","true","12.0"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

The graphical style, sounds and music are similar to Theme Hospital. Gameplay is sufficiently deep for a turn based game and incorporates a simple 2 AP system which makes the game flow nicely. Menus and action are understandable and there is enough amount of micromanaging to have variety. The story of the game is humorous and well written.\n\nOn the negative side:\nThere are some minor bugs which have been addressed and worked upon by the developers (a lot of communication from their side)\nThey main story itself isn't that short but by the end I felt it could go on more and the game could evolve more with more special missions. They are planning other cities so I guess I'll have to wait for those.\nThe mechanics and variety of enemies and maps are just at the edge - if the game would get any longer the variety should step up in the future.\n\nAll in all:\nSound: 10/10 - Very fitting for the style and found myself humming the themes later on.\nGraphics: 8/10 - Clear style and fitting, some problems with UI.\nGame-play: 7/10 - Very polished, balanced and quite fun. If there would be more mechanics and moves and tactics the score would be higher.\nStory: 8/10 - Love the story, dialogues and setting. A longer story and a more rewarding ending would get a higher score.\n\nWill look forward to additions and improvements to the game. It has style, nice feel and seems to have potential to be even greater.","June 23, 2014","true","30.4"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

A Ghostbusters theme is really a great idea, the whole running a business whilst catching ghosts in a turn based tactial combat sim is something we don't seem to get much of, although Xcom comes close - it's still not ghosts.\n\nSome ideas I would like to have experienced in this game are:\n- A new city, the game promises another city but as it stands London is the ONLY city.\n- The option to take more than 3 team members. Some ghosts are very difficult to defeat when one of them starts to panic.\n- Strategies that work together, like all team members firing at the same time to trap a ghost (much like in the Ghostbusters films).\n\nI realize this is not Ghostbusters the game, it is Ghostcontrol Inc. but the inclusion of Ghostbusters themes are ineveitable. As such, I would recommend this game, but I am slightly dissapointed that it doesn't quite reach my expectations.

And I admit that it's pretty fun for a $15 title. But it's not perfect.\n\nPros:\n- As mentioned by others, this is essentially a cross between X-Com and the 1984 Ghostbusters game. Your job is to use energy beams to weaken ghosts before snapping them up in traps, all the while trying to limit property damage and stop your employees from being drained of their sanity (the game's version of a health bar). The mechanics seem natural and understandable, and thanks to a wide range of equipment you do have several tactical options availble to you. You also get to upgrade equipment, though it's not a requirement.\n- Graphics are serviceable, and the retro-feel serves the setting well.\n- A wide range of baddies assail you, and there's enough adequate progress and randomized maps to keep the game interesting... for a time, at least.\nCons:\n- Still a lot of bugs, though I didn't encounter anything game-breaking as of yet, or ones that hurt my enjoyment.\n- While maps are varied, they aren't very big, and they often have tight quarters.\n- The game does start to get repetitive (though it takes some time to get to that point), so unless the developers add more content down the road, I suspect this game won't have the longevity of X-Com.\n- The one major complaint: the dialogue. The developers were trying to capture the same comic feel of the Ghostbusters franchise, but... they fail. Your team constantly quips about the situation, and the quips are pretty painful cliches. Thankfully you can turn them off if it becomes distracting.\n\nVerdict: it has its problems, and it could use more polish and content. But hey, I had fun. You want some cheap spirit-blasting fun? This has it.","November 5, 2015","true","15.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","1"

Old pixelated XCOM, not new 3D streamlined XCOM. You start off with a small team of ghost hunters armed with vacuum cleaners and repurposed radios as their tools to hunt the paranormal, and are given a single objective to work your way towards: earn this much money, buy a new car, buy better facilities, etc. Calls come in Ghostbusters-style of locations being haunted, you try to be your competitors to the job (with mixed results), and then the game becomes XCOM where health is replaced with "Sanity".\n\nAs per XCOM, you can upgrade your weapons, progressively buy better equipment, upgrade your car as well as buy better cars, and even expand your base. It's very involving.\n\nBut there's just one thing holding this game back: the bugs. Holy crap, is this game full of bugs. And now, a list:\n-Items not transferring to an inventory slot even though it counts against your Action Points only to show that yes, the item did transfer.\n-Items duplicating themselves and eating another item when you try to swap them.\n-A team member's entire inventory copying itself to another member when you only wanted to swap one item.\n-And, the one that drove me to do this review, a team member getting stuck on a tile while walking from Point A to Point B whereupon the walk animation loops itself and the entire game becomes unplayable. I couldn't move other members, I couldn't issue a different command, I couldn't end my turn, I couldn't even quit the game. The only way I got out was by going to my computer's Task Manager and manually ending the game.\n\nSo, yeah, the game has some issues, but it's still a really fun game. Aside from the last one on the list, none of these issues were game-breaking or eye-gougingly angering.\n\nPick it up while it's on sale, only get it for full price once they've fixed the bugs.","November 1, 2015","true","15.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","1"

Eventually youll get a better car so three people can go ghost bu--- controlling.\n\nThe graphics are nice for what they are, a throwback to the 16-ish bit days, isometric view. A lot of the ghost sprites are simple, and theres only two sprites for hunters, male and female, but over all it works. I really like the beam graphics when you fire a weapon, and the music in this game is awesome in my opinon. I think if you like or dislike the style will depend a lot on if you are used to or can at least appreciate the old school flare, its certainly not for everyone, but I like it. It can get a little cluttered when you have 3 hunters at the same time, or theres many ghosts about, thankfully, you can hit shift once to remove the walls, and once more removes any remaining view obstructing items. be careful though because in this mode you may think theres a path when you are really trying to walk through a wall. one more click of shift puts the objects back and solves any confusion.\n\nThe actual ghost hunting part plays similarly to games like Xcom or Omerta for quick reference. You can do so many actions a turn. Shooting, placing traps, moving, all use up Action Points. Shoot the ghosts to lower their energy, Place a trap below them, and then return to base to empty the traps. repeat. The ghosts can damnage furniture during the fights, and if they break enough you fail, if your hunters sanity drops too far, they will run off from the mission. You can heal and remove effects at the hospital.\n\nBetter equipment unlocks and you have different beams, some suck (that is, they pull ghost towards you, not that they are crap) and some push, some can only be used at a distance like a ghost sniping rifle. There is a variety of traps, beams, and sensors to use. The sensors tell you how many ghosts are in the building, and better ones tell you what they can do, etc. Theres also equipment like jumpsuits and goggles that affect your stats. I gave one hunter a long range beam and a sensor since she wouldnt be getting close to the ghost, for example, and let the other two handle trap placement duties.\n\nThere are other ghost control teams out there, and they dont really do much other than steal your mission if you dally to long.\n\nItems are also upgradable, requiring ectoplasm from your hunting excursions and time and money. You need a scientist, and the money, then let the ammount of time pass. For the asking price, I think this is a gem of a game, its simple, but fun. and has a sort of charm about it, such as how sometimes your people will say something like "Controlling makes me feel good" after finishing a mission.","August 7, 2014","true","4.3"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

The graphics are fun in their own retro style, and the theme works very well with the nostalgia look, but there are some definite rough patches. First and foremost is the cramped level design; I understand urban encounters are the goal, but most of the designs don't allow creative solutions or flanking for strategy. Put a tank in front, give him/her a big gun, and seal the exits. This is not to say the game isn't challenging at times, it's just that most of the challenge comes from conquering high health or high damage monsters.\n\nOn the positive side, the gameplay works well and doesn't try to be an epic adventure. It's a point and click combat mechanic based around a goofy B-movie universe. On that metric, GhostControl is a huge success. There is a charming and easily immersive core underneath a very bland exterior. I would recommend it, but be prepared to play for 60-90 minutes at a time.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/g3s/recommended/280540/","g3s","Nixon Fury: Agent of SHIELD","http://steamcommunity.com/id/g3s/","322 products in account","A surprisingly fun X-Com-style Ghostbusters homage.\n\nThe Gameplay takes the driving mechanic of the original Ghostbusters game from the NES, Master System, Commodore 64 era, adds an X-Com battle element and douses it all with a lot of ghostbusting-themed items. Mostly reminiscent of Ghostbusters, there is some Scooby-Doo and other ghostbusting TV show and film references, such as the use of weird, homemade ghost-hunting items that has been a long-running trope far before the Ghostbusters film was made.\n\nIn the game, your characters have Sanity instead of health. Once your Sanity gets dangerously low, the character will panic (saves vs Morale) and try to flee. If they lose all of their Sanity, they go insane and it's off to the looney-bin for them (they're dead, Jim)! There are 6 attributes: Sanity (health), Strength (carrying capacity), Constitution (affects movement), Aim (shot percentage), Morale (saves against fleeing), and Intelligence (not sure, will amend when I find out).\n\nThere are quite a few items that unlock over time, you can get better cars, your characters level up, you can expand your base, and you can even have your Scientist upgrade certain items to make them better. You will receive jobs through your smartphone, which also controls options, saving, an encyclopedia of the ghosts you've encountered, team management and some other stuff. On the overland map, you have a base, gas stations, a car dealership, and the item store that you can visit. And you're not alone in this map, either. There are two rival ghost exterminators that will take up your jobs if you don't get there quick enough. Basically, you can't just take a job and then sit around. There are linear objectives that will unlock more things over time and present difficult boss-missions.\n\nThe graphics are sprite-based and not that amazing. Very simplistic, very cartoon-like, and very much from the Commodore 64 and NES era. Sometimes, the environments can get a bit cluttered, but there are visual modes to hide walls, hide objects, and hide everything (including doors). Ghost types are varied and there is a bit of tactics that can be used trading off damage to push and pull the ghosts towards traps. Some of the levels are small, and some are bit more open, but there usually isn't too much open space, so you need to plan out your movement well. There is a good deal of map variety. You will, obviously, repeat maps, but enemy setups will change and the variety is fairly large. While in combat, you can sometimes destroy furniture, and certain ghosts will destroy furniture, too, such as poltergeists. The amount of furniture destroyed will affect your payout and if too much furniture is destroyed, you will lose the mission.\n\nSound is simple synth bit-tune stuff, again reminiscent of the older days of games. The music is entertaining enough. It never really grated my nerves, but it is bit-tune kind of music, so don't expect too much. Sound effects are similarly synth-like, and certainly passable. I doubt anyone is going to be knocked over by how amazing the sound is, but it isn't bad and fits with the whole retro motif. The barks from the characters can get rather repetitive, but that's true of nearly every game that has barks.\n\nI've enjoyed the game a lot. It is simple, and there can be times where navigating the maps is a bit more difficult than it should be, but the game does have a lot of depth to it and it does provide a challenge. The sound and visuals all give a solid retro experience, which can be a turn-off for some, but I think it provides a lot of charm and it feels, overall, fairly consistent. The enemies are varied enough that even when you play the same map again, it never plays out the same. Tactics are surprisingly varied, especially once you unlock some of the slingable traps.\n\nI would definitely recommend this title, especially if it on sale.","September 19, 2014","true","12.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The developers were very nice and gave me advice to fix it, but nothing worked, even after deleting everything, including savegames.\nAnother bug I encountered was that the Ghost traps didn't empty on it's own anymore. There's no option to manually empty them, so if they don't get emptied when you reach your HQ, you're in a lot of trouble. The next mission I started failed because I couldn't catch any ghosts. Then I thought I should just buy new traps... but the newly bought traps were full as well. Even restarting the game didn't do anything, so I can't play the game anymore.\n\nI feel REALLY sad for the developers that I'm getting a refund for this game, but it's unplayable for me. I understand that they're in a pretty stupid financial situation and barely have the resources to keep the company alive, so I thought maybe I should just keep GhostControl in my list and they can keep the money as a donation... but then again, I really hope to re-buy this game somewhen in the future, when the problems are fixed. As for now, a refund is more of a statement that I really think this game needs quite a few updates.","July 22, 2015","false","4.4"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","1"

It hits all the high notes, you have an HQ, a car, gear and you can upgrade stuff. You go out on jobs and try to catch ghosts without wrecking up the scene too bad.\n\nIf it had actually come out 20 years ago it would be pretty cool.\n\nUnfortunately, while it covers all the surface expectations the gameplay itself feels really, really shallow. The actual missions are slow and wrote, the commands you give your little busters aren't robust enough to really amount to much more than "Stand here and shoot the ghost until you can trap it" which involves walking up and sitting a trap right underneath it. You will do this over, and over and over again.\n\nIf you really need that feeling of owning a Ghostbusters franchise, this will scratch that it, but it won't hold you attention for long. I didn't even manage to upgrade my car before the 'busting' got tedious enough for me to walk away.\n\nRecommendation: Sims 3 with the Ambitions Expansion has a Ghost Hunter career that, if you stick 4 sims with it in the same house, provides a much more satisfying Ghostbusters sim.\n\nTL:DR - 3 Unlicensed Particle Accelerators out of 5, A diehard fan might get some fun out of it but even then you'll be struggling to keep interested.","December 1, 2015","false","2.5"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","1"
