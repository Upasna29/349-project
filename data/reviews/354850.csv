So you move a cube via some 3d obstacles, and switch its colours - otherways the next block on your path won't let you move forward.\n\nWhat I liked there is noticable better work of designer with the Unity engine. It is still flawed too much - but I'll give them a point for a progress. I also liked some of the backgrounds, the artwork is strange to look at, but not awful. Even decent sometimes. So after some levels it almost felt like I'm touring inside someone's mind... weird, but fun feeling.\n\nWhat I didn't liked is the aggressive tone of the game - like "hey! I'm hardcore here, move aside!" - which in my eyes is not add up with such type of gameplay. Like a thin pimply teenager wearing leather and spikes and pretending he's the 1%-biker there.\n\nOverall, it is one of those games, where you really need to be on the same channel with its developer, otherwise you'll just not get the idea where and how this piece of code is presumed to be entertaining. I tried to like it myself, as I do enjoy puzzle-games and platformers... but alas! It is even worse than the first game, by the terms of fun out of the gameplay.\nMy mark is 4/10. Funny try for a new indie developer, but I wouldn't pay for it.","May 6","false","22.9"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","23","26","0","4"

One of these new mechanics is changing the colour of your cube to the colour of the corresponding platform you are trying to move onto. Sure this isn't a bad idea, but combined with horrid, unresponsive controls, and this game is truly flawed. When you have to be super ninja fast about changing the colour of the cube to the platforms or they fall, the game fails to respond in time, horrible. The levels themselves are usually uninventive and ugly, and the soundtrack is the last thing they need. Especially the "shutdown initiated" every time you fall, WTF? Sure this game is challenging, but the overall game is just executed so badly that this challenge is not worth it.

The main problem with this is that you cannot turn your camera and you can only use WASD to move your cube around. This means that you only have 8 directions you can guide your cube to. If this wasnt enough, in this game you have a cube that bounces of its edges. This sometimes results in you pressing W to go forward but your cube actually just jumps of the platform because it got stuck on a corner. This wouldn't be too bad if you would be allowed to turn your camera so you could work around that.","March 16, 2015","false","3.2"," 35 of 60 people (58%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","58","35","60","3","0"

Unfortunately, the same idiotic and completely inept developers are at it again. Going into this, I expected more of the same rushed and rage-provoking gameplay, with maybe some change in perspective or design. But not rage-provoking because of any challening level design; because of sheer lack of effort in the controls and physics department. This delivered.\n\nWhere do I start? The addition of an adjustable camera was a noble idea; however, it was terribly executed. The camera is in a fixed position, not set on the block you play as. You CAN turn the camera; except that when you do, you just look off into the foggy abyss. You cannot change your angle so you can effectively see the forecoming floors in front of you. So, what was even the point of adding the camera?\n\nIt can also be pretty difficult to determine the difference between red and pink when you have to be quick. It is possible that this was done to add to the "rage game" asthetic; but if so, that begs the question: Do bad game mechanics make a rage game? No, they don't. Plenty of games have successfully labelled themselves as rage games that do not use being a bad game as an excuse for being a rage game.\n\nOverall, this is pretty much the same tomfoolery we got from the previous installement; except worse because they didn't learn their lesson from the last game. This might have been a nice experiment for your college game development class, but it does not make a nice Steam game; and the developers are morons for thinking otherwise.\n\nScore: 3/10 - Very Poor","February 4","false","0.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The second level was never ending. Anyway, his game offers some really challenging puzzles and at times make you wanna rage quit out of fusteration. It takes skill, exact timing sometimes, and just practice really. I haven't gotten to the harder puzzles and even after playing for a little bit it was challenging from the start. I can't really say there are any cons (even when puzzles seem completely impossible). The controls can be a bit difficult at time, but with practice it gets better. If it gets to hard, take a breather, and try again later.

It's good to stop on spot as a cube.   However, rolling as a cube....is limited.  Like I said, you'll feel okay with it for about 4 levels, before things get rough.  Timing between color change and landing on the tile (namely a falling tile) is terrible and it won't register correctly.\n\nI managed to survive to like...level 7 before quitting.  Spinning blades that insta-kill while you're on falling platforms iof the wrong color?  That's my limit.

That is how one day I got a 75% off coupon for a game that already was only $2. I thought to myself "Well ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, I may as well get the game. It doesn't look too bad and it reminds me of that old hamster ball game I used to play on the computer." I went in positively. Today I did. I pushed off playing the game because I was having fun with other games. I went in, chose a smaller window size, and though "This is kinda loud music, better lower it" only to find no option menu in game. I disliked that, but went on to the achievements. There was no exit option and some words were off screen. So I closed it and enlarged the window. This same thing repeated itself until it was practically full screen, and I could see the achievements. So I just went right into the new game option. What greeted me, you may ask? A puzzle game with a simple and overused mechanic and really, REALLY ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• physics, that are probably just the substitution for difficulty. I got through under five levels before saying "‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• this ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, I didn't come here for ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• puzzles and ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• graphics.

So you have to roll to try to stay on your platform AND change colors, after you've completed THAT train wreck, you find that you have to switch to a color, because if you arne't the color of that platform it will FALL, okay that was fine in a regular course, HOW ABOUT ON FULL OF THEM WHERE THERE ARE SEVERAL WALLS MOVING BACK AND FORTH OUT OF SYNC. And to add to that furustration, you basically have to roll constantly or the walls WILL get you, but if you roll constantly your cube will start to move diagonally and flip out and change speeds, which means you have little to no way to survive, as the whole board is random colors, so you have no chance. It's a good concept, horribly excecuted, even for less than 50 cents I do not reccomend. Unless you love being mad at stuff.","August 2, 2015","false","9.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I thought it could be relaxing flash game, made with Unity. Unity is a good start I could say. Ok, now the review:\n\nThingReviewMenuIn 1st part of game I could say there is no menu, you jump straight into the game. In 2nd part of the game menu is more improoved, much easier to choose what you want. But, when you press "New Game" button (haven't tried other buttons except "Load Game"), you have to wait couple of seconds to load the game. If you press "Load Game" button, level's number will appear so you could choose level. It's more interesting I think...LauncherThere isn't much to say about launcher of the 1st part of game, but 2nd part of the game's launcher is... Weird... I could say...? Take a look at it[prntscr.com]. Could someone translate me some words?PhysicsWell, the physics of game are terrible, not finished. I haven't played 1st part so much, so I will talk about 2nd part. In 2nd level of 2nd part of the game there is moving plate, the thing is, when you step on it, you have to manually walk where the plate moves, I couldn't even complete that level. Next thing I could say, when you fell off the plate, it says "Destroy initiated, actually, it takes some seconds to restart, since you fell little long.Controls1st part of the game had better controls, they were more easier, block moved much easier, it felt block is easy. In 2nd part of game it felt block is hard and it was hard to move it, especially when the plates are connected with angles.\nMy final verdict - some people say "Game eats so much ram memory", what I say "Game eats so much nerves".","April 15","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
