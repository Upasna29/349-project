Instead of being a puzzle, adventure, or action title, it is literally an interactive novel.  The only "puzzle," if you will, is attempting to piece together what happened to space vessle Mugunghwa before the events of the previous game, Analogue: A Hate Story.  Because there are some concepts originally introduced in that game, it's helpful to have played it before diving into Hate Plus, but it's not essential.\n\nIf you completed Analogue, however, you have the choice of either importing data from your save files or starting clean.  How the story progresses and the interaction with your on-screen sidekick is completely dependent on which of the two AIs from the previous game you are partnered with--or if you are partnered with both.  *Hyun-Ae is an adorable and somewhat naive girl with a big heart and an extremely tortured history (see Analogue for the whole story); *Mute is a security AI who is much more abrasive and sometimes struggles to fit in but interesting in her own right.\n\nThe "game" aspects of Hate Plus are minimal, even more so than in Analogue.  The only things you do are choose from a series of log files to read, address your AI when she wants your attention, and generally read along with your sidekick.  I'm not a person who likes to read books anymore, but presented in this format, the reading is engaging and fun.  But don't take this to suggest that this is a PG story for anyone to read as there are many mature themes and outright NSFW topics discussed within some of the logs.\n\nBut perhaps the most fun is with interacting with your chosen AI.  She will ask you to click on her from time to time to ask a question or discuss something with you; often, you'll be presented with a wheel of possible responses.  There's no right or wrong, but how you answer definitely can influence her perception of you.  If *Hyun-Ae is your sidekick, you'll even have the opportunity to bake an actual CAKE for an achievement.  (Unlike Portal, this cake is NOT a lie.)  And if both *Hyun-Ae and *Mute are along for the ride, their banter together is really funny at times.\n\nIn a game like this, presentation is everything, and Hate Plus does not disappoint, with charming graphics for the two AI's, a nice, clean interface serving as the ship's computer console, and an excellent soundtrack by Isaac Schankler, who also composed the music for Analogue.  My favorite song of the soundtrack is called "Vision," which is heavily played during the playthrough with *Hyun-Ae.  It's a beautiful song, one I find myself listening to quite frequently OUTSIDE of the game.  I've heard very few video game songs that I can listen to in that way (the theme "Icarus" from Deus Ex: Human Revolution being one of the only others).  It's hard to imagine a better interface or a more listenable soundtrack for the content of the game.\n\nI did find a few minor faults with the game, however.  One is the fact that after you download so many logs, you have to save your progress and quit.  This is a mechanism built into the game design; the number of logs you can pull is directly linked to the power remaining in your character's ship, and when it drops to 1%, you have to end the game, thus giving the batteries time to recharge for the next session.  This takes 12 real-time hours; there IS a way to circumvent this if you want.  It's an interesting mechanic and not entirely artificial as it's linked to the story, but it would be nice to not have to use what amounts to a cheat to bypass it if you want to spend more time reading through the story.  Additionally, I found control non-responsive more than in Analogue; I'm not sure if this is a problem or if it's another mechanic linked to the whole low-power-on-the-ship aspect of the story, but it's a minor irritation, though not one that I would consider off-putting.\n\nAnd then there's the possible red herring of an achievement: Level Four Revive Materia.  To this day, it appears NOBODY has been able to unlock it based on Steam's global stats (I checked this again before writing this).  I've researched this on-line along with a number of other players, and it appears this achievement is not actually possible.  However, there has been no word from creator Christine Love about this that I am aware of.  I don't consider myself an achievement snob, but for anyone who would like to 100% this game on an achievements level, this may be off-putting until a way to unlock it becomes more clear.  In that regard, anyone who considers achievements to be an important part of the experience should approach with a degree of caution.\n\nUPDATE AND SPOILER ALERT, 7-29-2014: A new article on Kotaku confirms that this achievement is 100% IMPOSSIBLE to obtain: http://kotaku.com/the-steam-achievement-that-nobody-unlocked-1610073943\n\nAnother possible turn-off for some is the straight story aspect of the game.  Even Analogue presented one fairly frantic and involving puzzle around the middle of the game in which you used that game's console to enter a series of commands to stop a nuclear meltdown.  Hate Plus does not include any true puzzles at all, with the possible exception of a sequence between you and the two AIs if both are accompanying you; I can't say more without revealing a MAJOR spoiler.  But those looking even for minor brain-teasers or anything other than straight reading and interacting with your AI(s) may not enjoy Hate Plus as much.\n\nBut for anyone willing to approach with an open mind and take a chance on a relatively new gaming concept, there's a lot to love about Hate Plus.  Put it this way: Analogue and Hate Plus are just about the ONLY games on Steam I have paid full price for without waiting for a sale, and the demo for Analogue hooked me on the idea almost immediately.  Granted, the games are not expensive to start with, but the fact that I was willing to pay the release price is a testament to how much I like Love's ability to craft this type of video game.  I'm looking forward to more such games from her in the future.  Hate Plus is definitely a winner.\n\n8.0 out of 10","November 26, 2013","true","24.2"," 98 of 105 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","98","105","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jfietkau/recommended/239700/","jfietkau","jfietkau","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jfietkau/","6660 products in account","Most of us take it for granted that our society is getting ever more liberal. But if you look at various cultures throughout history, there are actually many instances of relatively egalitarian societies slowly morphing into socially stratified class systems, often drastically reducing the quality of life for a large segment of the population. Few people talk about the fact that this is something that can happen, and even fewer talk about why.\n\nThis is just one of the many uncomfortable questions that Hate Plus, the sequel to Analogue: A Hate Story, raises.\n\nOriginally planned as DLC before morphing into a half-sequel, half-standalone-expansion, the story of Hate Plus is deeply interwoven with the one of Analogue. It would make little sense to play this one before the first, and in fact, I would go as far as saying that you should play Analogue before you read this review for the best spoiler-free experience. I will also draw more comparisons than I would for most other sequels, so if you are unfamiliar with Analogue, much of this review might be useless to you. You can find my review for Analogue here.\n\nThe plot of Hate Plus picks up right where its predecessor ended, with you, the space investigator, having recovered the documents and one of the A.I.s from the Mugunghwa. You can either continue from an existing Analogue save file, or you can start a new game and decide right then which of the two A.I.s you brought with you, who will then accompany you on your three-day journey back to Earth. She offers to investigate with you the contents of some mysterious files. As it turns out, these files detail the fate of *Mute's previous instance from before the computer crash and the Mugunghwa's descent from a thriving postmodern society into a despotic and totalitarian implementation of Joseon-inspired principles. They cover several individual lives throughout the years as well as some of the changes in the political machinery and the intentions of the people pulling the strings into different directions, and of course, how their political actions lead to societal consequences. Your job is, once more, to find out the truth.\n\nCompared to Analogue, this game makes a much stronger visual impression. Instead of the black-on-white look from before, it goes with a striking (if still largely monochromatic) color scheme, mostly using lighter text on dark tinted backgrounds. The character sprites have seen an expansion of their palette of poses and facial expressions, making them even more expressive. Long documents are no longer paginated, instead there is free-form scrolling. Texts are imbued with hyperlinks pointing you to "photos" of the important characters, which is certainly a big help in keeping track of the abundance of political actors. You no longer have to activate the A.I. after reading a document, instead she always accompanies you throughout the texts and comments as you go. Even though plot contrivances still prevent you from any bidirectional free-form chat, this change produces a more noticeable aura of companionship and teamwork from which the emotional investment strongly benefits. The soundtrack is unobtrusive but on point and comes with a wacky, ironically self-aware theme song.\n\nThe player freedom regarding the order in which the story is explored is so much bigger that it is almost impossible to overstate. If you felt artificially constrained by Analogue, you might be happy to hear that the game gives you almost no direction whatsoever. You just pick some files whose titles sound intriguing and hope that you can piece together the events and causalities after the fact. I would argue that the pendulum may have swung too far into the "player freedom" direction, as it is easy to ruin any dramatic arc and feel completely lost by choosing the wrong files early on or skipping some important ones for too long.\n\nYour companion A.I. choice has a significant influence on the delivery of the story. Since the events documented in Hate Plus take place while the Pale Bride is still in cryogenic sleep, *Hyun-ae only has a very vague knowledge of the circumstances and a low personal investment, which manifests itself in a more easily distracted and less attentive demeanour. I would recommend *Hyun-ae's route if you are looking for a more playful and cute experience instead of a heavier emotional hit. If Analogue is *Hyun-ae's story, Hate Plus is *Mute's. The former security A.I. has a noticeably better (but still fallible) grasp of society before and after the crash, and she is more strongly invested because her previous instance is a main character in the story. Even if you were initially put off by *Mute's behavior in Analogue, I would recommend her route in Hate Plus if you really want to dive in and get the full experience.\n\nOne interesting mechanic that bears mentioning if only for its controversy is the real-time break enforcement. Since you are reading the files throughout your trip back to Earth, you are twice met with a mandatory break time of twelve real-world hours, to sleep and recharge the ship's batteries. From what I've seen, many people are understandably critical of this design choice. However, I personally believe that I benefitted from the extra time I had to let the details sink in. I also know myself well enough to say that I likely would have binge-played it if this mechanic had not been in place, and I would be remembering it with less clarity right now. I understand how it might feel weird to not be solely in charge of your game pace, but I would encourage you to simply go along with it.\n\nWith much of the game being rooted in plot exploration, there is little of the story that I would want to give away here. It is more or less like Analogue, but even more intense, detailed, and shocking. The stronger focus on political intrigue (which the Pale Bride was mostly shielded from in Analogue), the engine improvements detailed above (even if the scrolling often feels rather jerky), and the overall more competent writing leave me in a position where I have to conclude that I liked Hate Plus even more than Analogue. Both titles have strong character writing and a compelling mixture of moods, but the sequel stands out thanks to the extra effort that went into it. Don't play it before Analogue, but if you liked that one, I can't imagine you being disappointed by Hate Plus.","March 2, 2015","true","12.4"," 53 of 57 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","53","57","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SolitaryCell13/recommended/239700/","SolitaryCell13","Kristoph Gavin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SolitaryCell13/","294 products in account","Hate Plus is the sequel to "Analogue: A Hate Story" from 2012, continuing the story between you and your computer wife, or just a friend side investigator. After loving the previous game, can the sequel step up to the plate and be just as good? Or even better?! Perhaps...\n\nStory: The story is focused on the events after Analogue, with you traveling with your selected A.I. partner to Earth and finally finish your mission, however it's 3 days long and the dialogue option is messed up just like last time. Luckily, your A.I. friend finds some logs about the history of the Mugunghwa before the Pale Bride (events of the first game). The game still has *Hyun-ae and *Mute, luckily not having to complete half the game this time to pick your character to playthrough with like last game. The logs in the game are even better than the last, it focuses on the previous events before the Pale Bride incident and has Old *Mute involved, a previous A.I. security version of *Mute, and your job is to find out what happened exactly to Old *Mute and the ship before the Pale Bride. Just as the previous game, the title sticks through the entire game. Hate Plus. It's a game that you'll find to be sickening with certain events, and it has many hateful characters and moments (In a good way!).\nSame as Analogue, Christine Love shows us how superb she is at writing as the logs you sift through have an emotional punch to them all, and tells a little tale for each of the characters you read about, as some logs are just diary pages or even council meetings. Many logs are hard to read for either hateful reasons, or pure sadness; which Analogue did do, however, I feel that Hate Plus delivers an even more emotional tale with *Mute's side of the story, never before have I had such twisted emotions in a game and long after completing, I was still thinking about the events that occurred in the logs, along with the events that were happening with me and my A.I. wife.\n\nHowever I feel as though *Hyun-ae's side is a bit too...cheery, or off topic. *Mute's side is figuring out what was going on with her old self, and how she's going to cope with the events from the past, however *Hyun-ae consists of cake baking, chatting, and just being lovey to each other. I suppose it's expected since *Hyun-ae was the focus in the previous game, however even *Mute in the previous game was more focused on the story as well. That's the only issue I have with the story here, but with *Mute's side, it's just perfect.\n\nGameplay: Surprisingly, the gameplay here in a visual novel style game, has improved quite well. Unlike the previous game, your A.I. partner reads with you with each log and gives you their thoughts on certain things in the logs while reading it. It gives more realism since in the previous game you would just talk to them after and didn't know if they were reading it with you, or they already read it beforehand...\n\nThere is one other major change than in the previous game. You have a certain amount of energy to download logs each day, ones you've downloaded all you can in one day and read them all, you have to power down and it's a literal 12 hour waiting process. For some, it was a bad choice, taking away the reading from the player for nearly the rest of the day. However I feel like it was a sensible choice and I was able to think things through more, just to focus on one day instead of trying to cram all the info of the entire game in one play session.\n\nWhereas most gamers this year are picking The Last of Us, BioShock Infinite, GTA V for their GOTY. I'd have to safely say, no other game this year has been as amazing as Hate Plus in my eyes. No other game has twisted my emotions this much or had such an impact on me. While Analogue is an amazing game, Hate Plus is just a few steps away from being a perfect title. If you haven't played either, I suggest picking both up. I guarantee you'll be loving every second of it....and hating every minute.\n\n9.5/10","November 1, 2013","true","18.0"," 32 of 38 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","32","38","0","0"

It's a sad little tale where really, no one is happy and the "heroes" lose. I liked that there's not really a big event that's the cause; wheels were in motion before the logs you start reading, and you feel those wheel get a little oiling during the course of events, then turn some more. There's no magic gas or anything behind it all.\n\nThe problem is it's less of a game than Analogue. You have enough power over the three days for every log, every single one. So why make me pick? It's completely pointless, you may as well just have fed them to me in a set order. In the original you had a log percentage and you felt like you were investigating, unlocking new avenues as you passed logs to your AI companion. There's none of that there, you unlock the next six logs, read them, then repeat with the next six and so on until you run out of power. There's no reason not to read them in sequential order.\n\nThere's also a lack of variety. You had the terminal in Analogue to mix things up a little, plus the bit with the reactor added a little drama to the proceedings. Here it's just so... bland. You read logs, then shut down. Repeat for three days.\n\nThere isn't a climax to the story either. You just run out of logs. Contrast that to Analogue where you find out why the Pale Bride doesn't speak, or why everyone on the ship is dead.\n\nIt isn't helped that Hyun-ae's route is so unchallenging. There's no conflict, no drama, no tension. How can a relationship survive between someone in a screen and someone in the physical world? Won't the investigator eventually leave her? ♥♥♥♥ that, here's a message about AI bodies to completely dissolve any potential for dramatic tension. The opportunity is also completely missed to draw parallels between your relationship and that of Mute and her security lieutenants, the way she had seen them come and go. What happened when you died and Hyun-ae lived on? Nope, nothing. What about charges against her for her actions on the ship? Nope, answered, no tension. What about her being part of the contract and thus taken from you? Ignored.\n\nHyun-ae and the story are just completely disconnected from one another, and the new log format doesn't help. She doesn't make any substantive contributions to the narrative, just little one liners here and there, generally along the lines of "harsh" or some such.\n\nI even felt the music wasn't as good this time around.\n\nI hope and pray that when I do it with Mute further down the line that it will be better, because there's someone with a more personal investment in events. There's also that achievement for reading all the logs again on day 3 with her, which would suggest she reviews them in a new light.\n\nI should be interested in the replay, but I can't get enthused. In Analogue I didn't need to re-read logs I still remembered, I could pass them straight to the AI to get the new content. You can't do that here, and I'm not sure I can face the idea of slowly... scrolling... through... every... log... again. It's a game designed to be replayed which isn't designed to be replayed. Or played at all really.\n\nThe game really only does one thing better and that's that it ties the side characters more tightly into the story. In Analogue you could know nothing about the Smiths and it wouldn't change a thing, but here all those people provide a window into how society was changing, and the impact it had on people.\n\nI come out the end of this really disappointed. There's a good story underneath it all, but it misses every opportunity to be more.","August 19, 2014","false","6.5"," 54 of 76 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","54","76","0","0"

Both this game and it's predecessor, Analogue, aren't a tangled spiderweb mess of routes, choices, decisions, Good and Bad Ends. There aren't many branching decision points in these games (Hate Plus doesn't even really have any), which kind of removes a lot of their "gaminess." That's okay with me; the visual/kinetic novel genre exists somewhere in the digital melting pot between traditional literature, comic books and video games. That's pretty great, in my opinion.\n\nI won't go into the story because it would be rife with spoilers, but I'll talk some about the game itself. Hate Plus is even more linear than Analogue, which is okay. The bulk of the "gameplay" is spent reading over recovered logs from the derelict generation ship Mugunghwa. You've got the assistance of whichever AI you either choose or carry over from your Analogue clear data. Depending on the choices made in Analogue or when starting a new game, you may have a different relationship with either *Hyun-ae or *Mute.\n\nThe meat of the game's story is told through the logs and the AI's commentary on the logs. Because your ship was damaged somehow, you have a limited amount of data you can sift through every 12 hours, which forces the game to be played over a period of at least 39-ish real-time hours (though you can circumvent this, but the author will call you a "jerkface"). Every time you read through six logs or read a log that's very significant to the plot, your AI partner will want to discuss something with you. Depending on your progress, this could either be a discussion about your relationship or about the mystery of the Mugunghwa's reversion to a primitive Neo-Joseon culture. Occasionally you'll receive a message from your employer or other people, usually while you are extracting new data from the encrypted logs.\n\nAnd that's pretty much the extent of the gameplay. There really isn't much "game" here; it's entirely about the narrative. And that's okay. The narrative is excellent; Christine Love is a fantastic writer. As a writer myself, she makes me jealous. The logs and your progress through them are carefully metered so you're slowly drip-fed the main story while seemingly being distracted by random bits and pieces that don't seem relevant. They become very relevant later.\n\nThe plot itself, like its predecessor, is seriously messed up stuff interspersed with little rejuvenating isles of humor and heartwarming. While I was going through the game (I was playing *Hyun-ae's route; I intend to finish *Mute's route eventually) there were many points where I desperately welcomed *Hyun-ae's insistence that we stop and chat. Some of the stories you read in the logs are soul-crushingly sad. Spending time "talking" with *Hyun-ae and her generally ridiculous levels of adorable sweetness balanced out the intense tragedy of the story from the past. I haven't completely finished *Mute's route, but her "breather episodes" seem to largely be composed of humor (and that's great, too). As the plot progressed further and further, the hopelessness of many past characters' situations started to press heavily upon me, drawing me deeper and deeper into the self-contained world and its terrible drama.\n\nThat isn't to say Hate Plus doesn't have problems. It has problems. The "real-life" time limit is my biggest personal gripe, even though you can circumvent it. As a general rule I hate it when games try to control the rate at which I play them. I can't stand turn limits, limited numbers of saves, save points, diminishing returns on experience points gain (I especially hate daily quests in MMOs, but that's a rant for another day). My second-biggest problem was the UI seemed to be very sluggish in responding to my mouse commands. Scrolling through the logs seemed to take far more "spins" of my mouse wheel than I would need to execute to scroll a web page in Chrome, for example. I was spinning the mouse wheel so much my index finger started to get a little numb! I tried lots of keyboard keys in an attempt to find some other way to scroll, but nothing seemed to work. Trying to grab the slider didn't work, either. Occasionally clicks on UI elements wouldn't register. I don't think these issues were part of the "interface screw" from the ship's low power and damage.\n\nA lot of people seem to have another major gripe: the infamous "cake" sequence in *Hyun-ae's route. To be honest, I actually loved this part. Partly because I really did find it completely, adorably cute, and partly because it gave me a brief respite from the soul-crushingly depressing things I was reading. I happened to be playing at 3AM, but I still went in the kitchen and made a cake (it was pretty tasty, so it worked out). I understand why the developer chose to add this, and I can understand and appreciate why people would be annoyed by it, but I really loved the fact that it was in the game.\n\nHate Plus is a fantastic visual novel and I'd recommend it to almost anyone, especially fans of science fiction. The plot will make very little sense if you haven't played Analogue, however, so I recommend buying them both and playing them both. Don't let the poor "hours of play per dollar" ratio scare you off; there's some really great story here!\n\nI will warn you though that if you suffer from massive testosterone poisoning, you will probably find both games to be very uncomfortable. Both can be aggressively girly, especially on *Hyun-ae's routes. For me, that's a big win. The gaming industry as a whole is completely dominated by titles that are aggressively hypermasculine. It's nice to have something that more caters to my side of things.","September 19, 2014","true","24.9"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","20","24","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/urganite/recommended/239700/","urganite","Urganite","http://steamcommunity.com/id/urganite/","233 products in account","TL;DR: I accept that this is a sequel worth playing/reading if you've finished Analogue, but while Analogue deserved much praise, this title deserves much criticism. I recommend the game on the premise that you have played and finished Analogue, because you should have no interest in it otherwise. The sexual content is way overplayed.\n\nMechanics spoilers ahoy, I mean, if you care about that.\n\nThe mechanics, interactions, and other minutae that made Analogue: A Hate Story one of the best visual novels are conspicuously absent, and instead replaced with infernal time-gating (thankfully, tied to the system clock) and lonely cake baking. Steam says I spent 5.3 hours to get through *Hyun-ae's path, and that's with me taking frequent breaks, including to make tea in lieu of checking my kitchen stocks since she apparently doesn't trust me to know what's in there (extremely immersion breaking to ask the player to go to the grocery store when they're supposed to be a solo starship pilot). AI character writing direction seems to have drifted away from what I would expect, at least for *Hyun-ae. I haven't yet decided if I will sit through probably the exact same writing to see *Mute's reactions.\n\nWhere the predecessor had many touch points with the active characters for most text entries that let you explore their feelings and personalities, this game sadly just has them looking over your shoulder, mumbling incomplete commentary about the text before you're able to read it. *Hyun-ae had few relevant things to say about most of the events covered, and I felt a lot of what she had to say was unseemly for her character. Compared to the skillful, asymetrical revelations made in Analogue that progressed your understanding of the events in a way that made you ask more questions despite easily figuring out the ultimate end, this game is effectively a linear text with enforced interruptions.\n\nThe discussion of sexuality in Analogue was masterfully revealed and, within context, tense, shocking, titilating, even dismaying and uncomfortable in the way you probably should want it to be. The sexual content of Hate Plus had no lead-up, and I felt it was quite gauche, bland, disinteresting, and way overdone. That's not to mention it was almost wholly unrelated to the main events and characters that shaped them (2 actual plot relevant characters and 1 implied side character involved with plot character of 10 total characters that be doin' it - 7 are "just there"). Given consideration of the supposed origin of the texts in the AI's code, I find the percentage of sexual and unrelated content pretty bizarre and unexplainable. I understand human preoccupation with sexuality as much as the next person, but I don't think I'm alone in feeling that sticking it onto (into?) everything kills the appeal. And I had to talk at length about it just now because it's just so much of the text that it can't go unaddressed.\n\nAnalogue touched on a lot of personal themes and had a tragic story that was difficult to swallow, a setting with mystery, and revelations that packed a punch and really made you feel a lot of different things. Hate Plus's story made sense, but didn't have any particular revelations, after all, we already know the aftermath, but that was the same for it's predecessor as well. I'll not fault it for being what it is, an explanation of what happened immediately leading up to widespread illiteracy and loss of records on the colony ship. But, to be frank, the pre-existing class system made it seem like it was not far off from that to begin with, and more could have been written about earlier events that cascaded up to that point. About how a somewhat 'modern' society could be sustained on the ship despite the decline of knowledge. More about the gradual loss of knowledge and technology, was it related to the fertility issues? Tying more side characters into the main plot instead of leaving them stranded.\n\nI think the biggest take-away from Hate Plus is that I didn't really have any strong feelings for any of the characters introduced by the narratives. Maybe a couple, but not strong feelings. I felt sad for Analogue's passing, and I felt awful having to decide which AI to save, a tense feeling sitting at the command line, wondering if I made the right choices before typing out 'download'. I did not feel much of anything for Hate Plus's passing. I wondered how a starship's engineers couldn't know the deleterous effects of gamma radiation, something every school-aged child knows, something discovered in the 1930's. I wondered how they could still have working computers with that kind of basic knowledge lost. Was this really where the downfall occurred? I guess the answer is no. That said, this could only really be a stepping stone, after all, the Chinese still use Chinese characters. Playing out the plot of Tree With Deep Roots in reverse wouldn't cause a modern society to collapse on its own, so I still feel like there's a lot missing.","February 15, 2015","true","5.3"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

There's a three day gimmick while interesting the first time around, is just a weird barrier that ultimately doesn't mean anything, since you can just skip through it by holding space down in the main menu. On the one route I've played, I played along with the gimmick, and it just felt bizarre having to wait, though I will admit that there was quite a bit of anticipation between the second and third day, so if that was the objective, then I suppose it was done well enough.\n\nThere are a few quirks that are quite annoying - for instance, for some reason you're unable to just smoothly scroll down a page, it has to pause every few seconds. I'm unsure if this was an intentional design decision or not, but relative to the first game where everything felt a lot more smooth and responsive, it's quite annoying. Another thing I disliked is how you obtain the data this time around. Instead of talking with your AI companions and having them slowly reveal the story to you, you instead just select and choose which entries you want to read. Furthermore, the AI companions aren't essential to the plot of this game, and feel more like side kicks than anything else.\n\nThat being said, the AI sidekicks in this game aren't bad, and in fact, it's interesting to hear their thoughts on the going-ons of what occurred on the ship a few hundred years ago. They inject a bit of light heartedness into what is ultimately a tragic story, though *Mute's route definitely has some even darker themes on the third day. I can't speak for Hyun-ae's route, since I never did get around to doing her route, but I'm positive the third day with her won't have nearly the same impact that Mute's did.\n\nAnd that is one of my big problems - this is subjective of course, others may loved it - but the ending to Mute's route is quite dark, as mentioned before. It deals with some really serious issues, and while it was quite effective, and it hit me like a bus, I didn't particularly care for it.\n\nOverall, only buy this if you're a HUGE fan of the original like I was, but make sure to avoid Mute's route until you finished Hyun-ae's, otherwise it'll probably sour your experience.","April 12, 2014","false","8.1"," 25 of 39 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","25","39","0","0"

Not because Analogue was a bad game either, but because this one keeps the story flowing after you wanted so much more from Analogue and I appreciate the creator for resuming the story.\n\nAs for the gameplay, it's still a point and click, message reading and desiphering game. You can carry on your data from Analogue or start over with your own preferences on how you want the game to begin and who with. I carried mine over, so I can't say much about starting with *Mute or a new route.\n\nThe soundtrack is still subtle but very nice to drown out to, and the character development only grows from here. It's a game you will get engulfed in and completely forget your surroundings.\n\nOne thing I'm washy about is the real time effect (waiting 11 hours between intervals to resume the story) but it does stretch out gameplay a lot more and makes it more enjoyable to come back to a greeting from Hyun.\n\nIt's hard to review it in one light, because to each their own. I highly recommend Hate Plus and Analogue though. It's worth at least trying out to see if you like it.\n\nAs Hyun stresses, it's not just another anime harem simulation, but focuses more on the story while balancing your relationship with Hyun and/or Mute (which you can be nice, or a total a-hole to them both, though Mute will probably tell you off).

Labcoat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LtLabcoat/","1680 products in account","So, like, I was just about to write this review when, at that very moment, my doorbell rang. It was my sister. So I interrupted my review, got up, and greeted her with a calm "hello". She was just back from the shops, and had bought me a sandwich, so I stopped to eat and have a chat. Her boyfriend was getting on fine, she was enjoying her job, the usual.\n\nAfter lunch, I wasn't particularly in the mood for writing, so I decided to do something else for a while. I ended up spending most of it on YouTube, where I learned great deals about Blinking and Slamming. It was quite the entertainment, and I felt a lot better afterwards. So I got back to writing this review.\n\n...\n\nIf you thought that was a whole load of completely unnecessary prose, then this game is not for you.\n\nSeriously, I knew going in that it wasn't as well-liked as the first one, but I absolutely wasn't expecting it to be so long and drawn out. It's not that there's unnecessary logs - although some are - it's that they're all way, way longer than they actually should be. Condensed by 50% and not lose anything.\n\nThe other big issue was that the story simply wasn't very interesting. The A-plot, the politics stuff, is fairly well written, although somewhat let down by that it's very predictable. As for the B-plots, they just don't go anywhere. While the B-plots were important in the first game for setting the tone and getting an idea of what life was like, here they're just mediocre relationship stories.\n\nThere's a lot of smaller but important issues too. The time mechanic that does absolutely nothing, that you can read entries out of order basically spoils earlier entries (and sequence breaks dialogue a little bit), there's a lot less AI chat this time, Mute route's badly written plot twist that's just there for the sake of a plot twist, and the goddam awful one-line-at-a-time scrolling.\n\nOverall though, it's simply not a good enough story that I can recommend to anyone.

Although not required, I would definitely recommend playing Analogue before getting this - it will put the characters and the situation they are in into a greater context.\n\nThe main interaction in the game involves unlocking and reading through a small number of log files at a time in order to solve one of the mysteries of the generation ship "mugunghwa," along one of two A.I. companions. It is the interaction with your companion that really makes the game special; Christine Love has a gift for writing interesting and complex characters that don't rely on tired stereotypes. The differences between the companions' viewpoints make multiple playthroughs well worth the time, despite the lack of mystery second time through.\n\nOne of the key mechanics of Hate Plus is the way it only allows a certain amount to be played each day. You can circumvent the system if you really want, but for those who like to get immersed in their fiction this real-world restriction makes the player feel like a more genuine part of the story. Played over the course of 3-9 days (as you're supposed to!) with a couple of hours per night, the pacing in Hate Plus is bang on.\n\nOn the whole I believe Analogue: A Hate Story is the better work, with more interaction and a more interesting mystery at its core, but Hate Plus is a more than worthy sequel. If you enjoy visual novels or are looking for a place to start in a genre you perhaps haven't tried before - there's no reason to miss this game.","November 26, 2013","true","13.3"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

That said, there are many things in this game that were skimped on when you compare it to the first game.\n\nFor instance, no Extras menu.  Not only that, you get the feeling that there should be an alternate route for Mute*.  And the story just felt limited in general.  Like it created loose ends that were never tied together.  It barely explains how the colony ship ends up how it did, with how much pointless filler we had in between obscuring the view.  Hell, and I know this is taking it out of context, but even the AI's were commenting how they failed to see the point of some of the messages.\n\nThat said, I suppose you could say that this game is a step up in terms of content + work.  Personally though, I preferred the simplicity from the first because with this new "HD Interactive" edition, you ended up having to scroll one line at a time just to see the character's reactions to the text.  Since I read way faster than that, I can't tell you how many times I wanted to jump paragraph by paragraph instead.\n\nPersonally, I'm not a fan of the real-life character portraits.  They clash horribly with the colorful sprites.  Despite that, I do admit that I was somewhat interested in seeing the source material for Hyun-ae and Mute's portraits when they eventually popped up.  Or is it the reverse.\n\nMm...but, I do have one positive things to say.  Mute is my favorite character.  So I had to get this anyway.\n\nI'd recommend the original, Analogue: a Hate Story.

It's predecessor Analogue: A Hate Story was really good. Great atmosphere from the start ( story is on a abandoned ship and you have to investigate what happened, music was great and one time you had to hack a console to prevent core meltdown while developing relationship with the AI. ). It brought new things to the table of Visual Novels and it was fresh...\n\nHate Plus feels like a downgrade. Music is not memorable and there is no feeling of supspence and exploration unlike in Analogue: A Hate Story. There are at least two design decisions that I hate in Hate Plus :D. First when you run out of power which can be pretty fast if you aren't intrested in some lousy stories ( of what it appears to be homosexual relationships ) you have to wait ONE REAL LIFE day to progress the game... well thanks a fricking lot.\n\nWhat if you have kids to pick up from kindergarden? You have work tomorrow and then you won't have time in the afternoon? Well this game doesn't give a flying fart. You have to adjust or start New game and try different route and pick different logs.\nImagine that you are playing Call of Duty you have finished first chapter and then game tell you : Your soldier is tired he needs to rest ONE REAL LIFE DAY in order to progress to the next battlefield... ARE YOU FRICKING KIDDING ME??!\n\nNext bad decision is the graphics. They have been slightly enlarged compared to Analogue. In my opinion it looks a bit itimidating and too close ( maybe they wanted players to feel closer to the AI... ). Whatever they thought It doesn't work for me...\nOn top of that navigating through the menues is cumbersome because of the speed that windows appear ( unfold ). On top of that scrolling speed is slow...\n\nApart from that for those who have played first game this will feel a bit like a downgrade but as a curious person I need to see it to the end.

It's also stunning that it heavily binds to the first game: lots of the choices in the first game WILL have some results here (like, if you said you were a female, they'll actually act to you as so). In addition, although I'm not sure, the game doesn't have the harem route if you didn't play the first game, meaning that it's a sort of incentive on getting the first game, which is already a great game on its own.\n\nHowever, as much as I loved this game, I think this game is much flawed than the original.\n\nFor instance, the game is much more linear...and by linear I mean there's really no way to miss any logs and by the end of day 3 you'll basically finish the game: all that matters are the choices and how you've start the game with (Mute, Hyun-ae, or harem, as well as the sexes). This is kind of a big disappointment, since it basically boils down to "restart the game, do the same stuff, but different choice". I know this is the drill in VN games but even normal VN have some depth. This game doesn't.\n\nSecond, the stories are now a little...worse. But also better. But also worse: it's not easy to explain, but essentially the quality is far better and the logs are also much more detailed and much better written...but at the same time they don't always end up being related to the story, with only a few related to Mute and the ship in general. Granted, it gives an idea of the mentality and that's very very good, but I admit sometimes I just didn't get the purpose.\n\nAnd last, but not the least, I really loved the addition of the "3 real days" mechanic...but too bad it can't be turned off. Don't get me wrong if I say that, despite being great and kind of involving, I wish I could turn it off somehow and just see how it'll go with, say, Mute alone. But no, I'm forced to wait 12 hours after each session, which is very annoying. Some might not be bothered, but can get tiring pretty fast.\n\nHowever I really loved this game and I Loved how it ended it in a very satisfactionary way: that's very hard to accomplish nowadays and I applaud how this game has ended.\n\nIn other words, if you loved the original Analogue, don't try it: you must have it!\nOf course, avoid like the plague if you don't like heavy story driven and non-action games.\n\nPS: Also...is it me, or this game has way more fanservice than the other?","November 29, 2013","true","8.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

The gameplay is more or less the same, though a bit improved in a few areas so you spend more time reading the logs and less time poking the AI to ask them their opinions. In fact, they just interject with comments as you read the logs themselves, so you will get their reactions as you are both reading it at the same time. I've not finished the other routes yet, but the so-called "Harem" route where you have *Hyun-ae and *Mute together results in quite a few amusing moments (particularly from *Mute, who basically is the "straight man/tsukkomi" here).\n\nWhile perhaps not as... no, nevermind. The story is still pretty dark and still can be a difficult one to get through, though the end of it honestly was fairly predictable. But if you liked the first game, then check this out too because it answers unresolved questions from the first game and has more crazy, raunchy, and depressing stuff for you to read.

And besides you can't play the Harem route without Analogue.\n\nThere is a real life 12 hour "lock out" period between days. I say "Lockout" with pretend air quotes here as you can skip this time by hovering over the save file while it's on countdown and pressing the "S" key. This does however ruin one single achievement.\n\nAnyhow with that out of the way let's talk Hate. (Possible SPOILERS ahead. I'm not gonna say since I really don't know what some people may consider spoilers. If anything I'm just gonna be spoiling the first VN/game.)\n\nLike the previous Analogue you will yet again be playing the role of Space Investigator reading documents with your cute AI companion(s) who you convinced to come aboard your ship's computer by either accepting their virtual love, friendzoning their hopes and dreams or even possibly unlawfully kidnapping an AI. Either way they're back to make comments while you read documents, but In real time document scrolling action.\n\nWhat's that? You left alone?\n\nWell too bad that's not a route. You'll be scientifically provided with your choice of *Hyun-ae or *Mute if you start a new game instead of starting off a save file from Analogue. The Loner end to Analogue is locked as a grey file that you can not start from.\n\nOnce you do start a game from either a save file or the new game button you well be met with a new interface which will be colored depending on the current route you are on.\n\n*Hyun-ae is Blue.\n*Mute is Yellow-Male Space Investigator.\n*Mute is Red-Female Space Investigator.\n*Harem Route is Pink.\n\nBesides this the command screen isn't in this game so no more comman shenanigans.\n\nDocument acquisition greatly differs from Analogue as you have access to (mostly) all of the documents straight from the get go. However the catch to this is you have to extract them at a rate of 6 documents per go which you can do until you run out of power. Essentially you get around 15 documents on day 1 21 ish on day 2 and day three varies a bit.\n\nThis means you're free to read what catchs your eye first, then either expand on the topic or try something else.\n\nI personally like this system. Replayability is questionable because of it due to the fact that the documents never change no matter what AI you've got. If you're playing different routes you're doing it for that AI's reactions and comments on the documents.\nAnd for their break chat events.\n\nThat isn't to say you shouldn't play all the routes. Each route has different AI specific events which are related to the story for the most part. I personally enjoyed the Harem route because it's hilarious with the AI's bantering between each other even while you're reading a document.\n\nThe story is on par if not better than Analogue's. It's the backstory of how the Mugunghwa became what it was.\n\nThe focus of this VN/Game seems to be more player immersion as the real time comments by the AI's while you scroll through the document and read it give it a more realistic feeling as if you were actually reading documents on a computer with AI's on it. The 12 hour wait periods are supposed to help with the immersion but if they do is questionable as reading all the documents for a day can take maybe 30 minutes to one hourish. Other things are that (MINOR SPOILER) in *Hyun-ae's route she asks you to bake her a cake. if you agree to there are times dialogue options that won't let you use them properly unless you wait about 2 minutes for on and around 20 minutes for the part where you should be baking the cake. You can then take an image with your phone or camera of the cake you baked on a certain screen and then send that to the developer for an achievement. To my eternal shame I did indeed make the 5 minute microwave cake and sent in an image.\n\nAs a side not if you're rushing through routes you may want to turn on "Minimal Animations" in option. For some reason even on a fairly powerful computer the game lags whenever your AI companion has a facial expression change or says something while you're scrolling a document. Which can get very annoying. It's mainly noticable on the Harem route as you have 2 AI's making faces and saying things.\n\nThe music is good although after going through the OST I realized I never really noticed the music changing half the time. Harem Route ending theme is fantastic though.\n\nOverall yes I would recommend this VN/Game/Document Reading Simulator if you're a fan of the author, the series, or just want more cute AI waifus.\n\n","June 24, 2014","true","9.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

It was interesting, it was fresh, it had memorable characters, it had some nice mechanics for its genre. So I bought this game too, a sort of prequel-sequel.\n\nI'm sorry. I hate it already. Let me explain. It shall be my own hate story. Bear with me - for if you played this game, you are so, so used to emotional pain.\n\nFirst, the plusses. You can continue with the ending unlocked in Hate Story. This is good. Either of the AIs or both (solitary route not supported). You get full interactions from the Harem route, and it is also good. Also, you get to know (step by step), what exactly happened before the events of Hate Story. This should be good, but in fact isn't.\n\nAnd now to the crux of the matter. The negatives. Why I hate Hate+. Hate is such a strong word, maybe I am just emotionally exhausted. Playing this game feels like wading through filth. And the game won't let reach you any emotional catharsis, no. You have to suffer through it three consecutive real-time days, because the nasty bugger won't let you continue (except for outright cheating). Smart, eh? No, not so much.\n\nCharacters. Did I like them in Hate Story? Not that much (maybe because most of them were monsters, including AIs), but they were at least believable and played their roles well. Here, in Hate+. they are TRAGIC monsters. Even the worst villains were so emotionally crippled I wondered how they managed to breathe at all. Please. No more. It's like taking a super-concentrated dose of poison. I don't need my old depression back, thank you very much.\n\nThe narrative gets to the point that practically all light is gone, all hope lost, made more obnoxious by zero distance the leading AIs have towards reading the old logs. Yes, *Old Mute was *Mute's previous incarnation, but I dislike how one BIG event in the game was resolved (no spoilers). There should be a limit to self-wallowing.\n\nThis game is bleak to the point of ridiculousness, writing is worse than in Hate Story (*Old Mute and her chief officer are laughable characters, Mary Sue and her faithful sidekick played hammy to the max), not much of meaningful choices in comparison to Hate Story, even the mechanics are worse. LGBT love stories feel forced here - am I supposed to be thinking all the evil stems from unhappy lesbian love? That manipulative, cruel, nasty, controlling people are like that just because their One True Love was doomed because of the evil society? How stupid do you think I am? The artwork is inconsistent (stay anime or not, why stretch my suspension of disbelief even further?). The whole "mystery" is plain worse - *why* is sometimes not as important as *if* something happened.\n\nIf you liked *Mute or *Hyun-ae, don't play this game. Save them stress. Save yourself some stress.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","February 1, 2015","false","3.4"," 15 of 26 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","15","26","0","0"

There is one achievement on here that was added, but purposely not coded in, because plot/reasons. While I can appreciate the statement by the author, I feel this is an abuse of the Steam Achievements system.  So let this warning stand; if you want to get a Perfect game, you never ever will.  If you feel any sense of compulsion to complete things, then AVOID this game, because it will be a permanent itch you can never scratch.\n\nThat said, now I will get into the game review itself.\n\nHate Plus is the sequel to Analogue: A Hate Story.  In the previous game, you are investigating the downfall of a pre-FTL ship with the help of the ship's AI.  Over the course of the game, you -- the player -- can read about some tidbits about the ship's severely patriarchial culture (based on Korea's Joseon dynasty, 1392 to 1897 AD) and the culture shock one of the protagonists in the logs suffers when they awaken from a cryogenic sleep and are essentially thrown back in time (in a cultural sense).  The story that unfolded in the first game and the cultural influences and motivations the player can read about are pretty interesting!\n\nSadly, much of that seems to be lacking in Hate Plus.\n\nIn a sense, Hate Plus is a more of a "prequel" than a sequel, but the term can only be used loosely.  The log files you are investigating in Hate Plus take place before the events of Analogue.  And while it does fill in the gaps as to the "what happened" the previous game left open, it seems to lack the same kind of "why did this happen" punch that Analogue delivered.  The relevant political entries feel dry and perfunctory, and the relevant personal logs somehow lack personality.  As though it all culminates to say, "I do the things, because reasons!"  As a result, the experience feels more hollow.\n\nPerhaps it's the method of delivery.  As in the previous game, you are given an artificial restriction on how much you can read.  However, unlike the first game, you have no restriction on which files you can read first, with the exception of one or more encrypted files that must be brute-forced (meaning the event always occurs at a specific point in the game, regardless of which of the other logs you've read).  This essentially means that all of the other logs cannot contain anything too important, lest the player read those ones first.  The result feels like so much incohesive, dry filler material than actual plot or story, even when selectively extracted by storyline and sorted/read by date.\n\nOverall, I found myself unable to connect or empathize with any of the actors in this story as well as I was able to in Analogue.\n\nI picked this up in a Humble Bundle, so at the very least I can feel some gratification that most of the money I spent went towards a charity. But if you don't have that option, have played Analogue, and are looking to solve the mystery of the Mugunghwa's cultural shift proposed in that game, well, you are better off pocketing your money.  This is one mystery better left unsolved.\n\nEspecially for the achievement hunters.","February 18, 2015","false","18.5"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","1"

Dispatch Control sends their secret black ops team to do their dirty work, the Mugunghwa security team, led by *Hyun-ae. Following Dispatch Control's orders and assassinating those whom they believe are criminals, Mugunghwa security kill a man known as Emperor Ryu, but soon discover he was a civilian reporter, documenting civilian deaths caused by Mugunghwa security. *Hyun-ae and his team realize they have been duped by Dispatch Control and desert, becoming space pirates on the run from Dispatch Control's forces.\nTen years later, *Hyun-ae drunkenly attacks Dispatch Control's battlecruiser, the salvage ship from the beginning of the game, while near the ship of Mugunghwa. *Hyun-ae rams the salvage ship from the beginning of the game, hoping to gain revenge on Dispatch Control. The ships collide, forcing both to crash land on the hull of Mugunghwa. One of *Hyun-ae's men, *Mute, is critically wounded in the crash and *Hyun-ae is forced to find an energy cell to drive the ship's medical equipment. On the ship, a former popular tropical-like resort destination, the population has mutated into feral tribes and carnivorous plants. *Hyun-ae fights through to one of the salvage ship from the beginning of the game's escape pods, and retrieves the escape pod's energy cell, as well as an "instinct leash." The leash, when worn, begins to provide him strange tactile information, such as points for each enemy he kills.\n*Hyun-ae returns with the cell, and while *Mute is under operation, the mutants attack their ship, leaving *Mute a disfigured cyborg. *Hyun-ae and *Mute, the only survivors, decide to work together to get off the ship, despite *Mute's disapproval of *Hyun-ae's thirst for revenge. The instinct leash leads *Hyun-ae to another escape pod, where they find a UNIX command-line terminal, a salvage ship from the beginning of the game security soldier who agrees to work with *Hyun-ae and *Mute, but only after they rescue Dispatch Control. As they battle through the ravaged city, a UNIX command-line terminal explains that Mugunghwa has been used by salvage ship from the beginning of the game security as a sort of training grounds, with the instinct leashes the soldiers wear as a means of ranking those within the test; those that scored kills would be the only ones that could get ammunition and other supplies to survive. When *Hyun-ae learns that a UNIX command-line terminal was Emperor Ryu's daughter, he tells her that Dispatch Control was responsible for her father's death, but claims he does not know who actually killed him.\nThe three make their way to the top of a skyscraper where Dispatch Control's pod landed. a UNIX command-line terminal accuses Dispatch Control of her father's death, but he simply pushes her off the side of the building. Dispatch Control then warns *Hyun-ae and *Mute that there is an armed "DNA bomb" on the salvage ship from the beginning of the game that will wipe out all life on the ship, and they must go and disarm it, as his rescue ship will not arrive in time. As they travel underground, Dispatch Control explains that prison convicts were used as the labor force to maintain the ship; they rebelled when toxic byproducts, created by the ship's solar radiation shields, were dumped in the underground prison. The convicts destroyed the shields, exposing the entire population to mutating radiation.\nAboard the salvage ship from the beginning of the game, Dispatch Control tricks *Hyun-ae and *Mute into arming what was actually an inert bomb, and leaves them to die. As fire breaks out aboard the fallen ship, the two are saved by a UNIX command-line terminal, who survived the fall by catching a power line on her way down.","November 26, 2013","true","5.1"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","11","19","0","0"

It's... mostly successful in what it sets out to do, but there's no denying that it's not nearly as gripping as Analogue: A Hate Story. But it's hardly the first sequel that didn't live up to the original - and that said, it's certainly still good.\n\nFirst up, I should mention that this is NOT a game where you should skip the previous installments and jump right in. You'll want to play Analogue: A Hate Story first. Although you could theoretically skip the first game entirely and still make some sense of the story, it would be... difficult. The story is already complex enough without deliberately hacking major chunks out of it.\n\nNow then, we'll start with the good. Hate Plus is very well written - although this should come as no surprise, since Christina Love (the developer) is a fantastic writer. I loved the writing in the first game, and that hasn't changed with the second. Granted, the story is a bit more... rambling and disconnected, but it's still fascinating to piece together. The sound track is also exceptional, if not revolutionary. The music is generally simple and repetitive, but there are several tracks that really do help set the mood as you wade through dozens of old computer logs that range from innocent to scandalous to horrifying. The interface is also subtly improved, reducing the amount of backtracking and note-taking that you had to do in the first game - most notably by providing a collection of 'Character Files' on all of the major characters that are updated as you discover new information.\n\nAnd now the bad. As with the first game, Hate Plus suffers from the usual limitations of the Visual Novel genre - it's rather short, fairly linear, and only grants you the illusion of choice. Unlike in the first game, there's no muddling your way to five or six different endings. This time, you make your choices right at the beginning of the game (or load your save file from the first game) and THAT more or less determines how things will play out as you progress. There are still four or five different endings, but those endings all require you to start a completely fresh file since they're absolutely mutually exclusive of each other. And, sadly, while each of those play throughs is distinctly different in some key aspects, it doesn't change the fact that you'll end up wading through dozens of the SAME files over and over again (and reading the same plot twists over and over again) if you want to try for the different endings.\n\nBut of special note is the subtle nods to immersion. I appreciated the little touches in the first game (typing into the "ship console" for example), but Hate Plus takes it a step further. This time around you don't just read a file and then ask your AI companion what she thinks of it - she actually "reads" it alongside you, commenting on new twists and reveals as you scroll through the files. She'll regularly interject between files (usually every three to six files), to share her thoughts or concerns about what you've found out so far. And heck, there's even a fake little "spacemail" button that occasionally updates with new letters that are largely unrelated to the game, giving you insight into the world of the far-flung future (the intergalactic variant of the Nigerian Bank Scam is particularly entertaining).\n\nThen again, not all of the attempts at immersion are entirely fun, though. Hate Plus makes heavy use of a "time-lock" feature that essentially locks up your progress between each "game day" (and sometimes during certain special events). The game takes place over a period of three "in-game" days, and apparently the creator wanted that to be represented by having the player actually spend three days on it - so each time you finish an in-game day, your save file actually locks until your computer timeclock reaches the next day in real life. It's simple enough to circumvent, but still more annoying than cute - especially once you've already beaten the game once or twice.\n\nBut for me, jumping through the hurdles (minor as they are) was worth it. For those who enjoyed the first game and want to find out more about the Hate universe, then Hate Plus is a must. It's a good bit heavier on political intrigue and NSFW computer logs, but the story is still fascinating if a bit disjointed. If you're like me, then you'll love to Hate.","February 16, 2014","true","9.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There was a lot of mystery surrounding the first one where you first met your AI companions, Hyun-ae and Mute, onboard the derelict generation ship Mugunghwa, and now you return to what could be considered an afterthought; the ship and everyone on it are gone, you're on your way home to Earth, and you have an AI companion onboard. There's no room for anything to go wrong, so why should we care? And yet, the narration here does something different. It's about reflection.\n\nThe first game was all about choices and the handling of disasterous situations. You found the lost generation ship and had to figure out why everyone was dead (and solve a crisis or two along the way). In many ways it reflected the narratives you found in the logs, where the people living on the Mugunghwa had to deal with awful situations and there were little to no ways for anything to end up well. The best ending you could get (for me) is one that doesn't even appear possible on the surface and requires you to 'cheat' in a sense to get it. The first Hate Story was a tragedy you got to witness. And even though the logs you read in Hate Plus are the prequel to the logs you read in the first game, Hate Plus is all about living with the aftermath of choices.\n\nThis is not a game about choices, but reflections. Did you do everything right? Did you do everything you could, especially when everything goes wrong? The game's design tries to force reflection on the user, and I think the artificial constraints are there for a purpose, take it or leave it. For one, you cannot read everything in one go: through a technical reason the AIs tell you, you cannot download more than six of the old logs at a time, and your downloads are limited per day to how much power your ship has. Don't worry; you will be able to download everything from the logs to read over the course of the game's three days. Your choices here are largely about which logs you want to read first. Having to wait for the game to download the new messages gives the player time to ponder what they've just read. Do they pursue the same story or see what else is lurking in the files? The AIs also contemplate, reading along with you as you scroll through the documents and provide running commentary.\n\nAs a side note, this is my one gripe about the gameplay, which is that the text scrolling is not smooth. Oftentimes it felt like my mouse's scrollwheel was malfunctioning, but using different mice produced the same problem. While this lack of smooth document scrolling is annoying to readers, it does let you catch Hyun-ae and Mute's color commentary better. Their commentary is another source for reflection.\n\nThen there are the days; when your ship is out of power, the game forces you to wait 12 real time hours to read the next set of logs. This is spaced out over 3 real days, so the game shouldn't be a huge time commitment. For some people this will be infuriating and a deal breaker, but I personally think that it gives you the player time to process what you've read, and also throw some curveballs with the narrative. I can't see some events having the same impact without you having to wait, such as when you wait to read the penultimate log about what happened to Old Mute before her memory was wiped. You can download it on the first go but you can't read it first thing because it needs to be decrypted, which takes in game time.\n\nAll in all, this game brought the feels. It's a great visual novel that, while not as involved as the original, nevertheless asks for commitment from the player to give it the time to tell its story. It's got transhumanism elements, society issues, tragic romance, and also cake... and yes, there is an achievement for baking a cake in real life. And the only reason I don't have that one is because I don't have a camera. If this is your first visual novel in the Hate universe, I'd still recommend Analogue first. If you finished Analogue and want to find out what really happened to the Mugunghwa, now's your chance!\n","December 13, 2013","true","12.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Imagine a really good text adventure from back in the day.\n2. Eliminate all the annoying parts that haven't aged so well (having to guess exactly what the game wants you to type, for example).\n3. Carefully build the game world so that every aspect of the interface makes sense within the world, and doesn't break immersion.  One early example: there's a good story reason why you can only interact with the game world in limited yes/no fashion.\n4. Add in enough exploration and discovery to make a Zelda game proud - yes, even in a text adventure.  Bring in a modern approach to choice and characterization possibly inspired by Bioware's best, while never just copying it.\n5. Wrap it all up in a compelling sci-fi... mystery? horror? Let's just call it a story that gets progressively more dreadful and cringe-inducing as you unearth it, but compels you to dig it up anyway.\n6. Season liberally with deceptively engaging art.  I know the screenshots scream out, 'look at me! I learned to draw by tracing Sailor Moon!', but there's a *lot* to the art in this game.  It adds characterization, tension and empathy in ways you wouldn't expect, and subtle changes in expression and posture make all the difference in interpreting the texts you'll come across.  And you WILL need to interpret them, because all the narrators are unreliable and biased.\n\nSo, what's the catch? Three of them.\n\na. This is definitely a sequel. It's entirely possible to play it without touching Analogue: A Hate Story, but you gain a lot by going through the first one first (and it's also excellent).\n\nb. DON'T CHEAT.  There will come a point where the game will tell you to do or not do something, and you will stare at the screen and say, 'Seriously?'.  Then you'll try to Google a workaround.  Don't do it. I mean it.  That game design choice was made for a very good reason, and you'll rob yourself of some of the story's impact if you bypass it.\n\nc. If you're playing both games, try to play them both through Steam. After finishing Analogue, I played Hate Plus through another service, and had to answer a questionnaire about what my ending was like.  If you play both on Steam, then you can just load your old Analogue save and start from there.  It's similar to how Mass Effect imports work.\n\nAll in all, a very worthwhile entertainment experience, and not one you'll forget any time soon.","November 26, 2013","true","2.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

To actually have to wait for a substantial amount of time in order to be able to continue the game was equally frustrating as much as it was amazing.\n\nIt gave me time/forced me to process the story and actually reflect on what I'd read and found out so far, and it also did amazing things to increase the immersion, because well, time would pass, I'd do other stuff and then return to what almost felt as "my actual job".\n\nAll in all, really cool game/VN with some really cool mechanics going on and really nice immersion.

Using unnessacary energy, and being in photos. Well played developers, Well played. Damn you emotional blackmail!"\n\nWell. This game is fairly clever. I'll explain one scene, which is probably the most relevant, to explain the best moment within the game itself. So brace yourself for some spoilers. If you don't want spoilers at all, Skip to the bottom paragraph.\n\nSo, Theres a scene, where *hyun-ae asks you to make a cake. I am far too lazy for that however. So, since I had to head out the next day, I played a different scene and came back to this one with a freshly bought cake. Why? Because I believe you should try your best to get immersed within games, so I compromised. I bought a cake. So, I went through the dialogue, and then after waiting the minimum amount of time while your supposed to make a cake, I came back and told her I was done. Which, she replies with a few lines, then "Did you actually go out of your way to Humour me?" And then three options appeared. "Yes, I did" "No, I didn't" "I bought it". How the hell did this game know I would just go and buy one?!?!? Oh, and I did take a picture of myself, and sent it to the developers, for an achievement, even though I go out of my way to avoid photos. This game made me do two things that go against my beliefs. Using unnessacary energy, and being in photos. Well played developers, Well played. Damn you emotional blackmail!\n\nSo, I ended up enjoying this game. Although, It's abit forwarding for a visual novel, as they both commit to your very quickly, However I've only finished one ending. I did really enjoy this, however it is a lot of reading. Lots and lots of reading. More than the first. Which the first, for those who don't know, anologue: A hate story. Play that before this one. If you did play that one, and liked it, you may like this one. It's fairly similar in all the good ways. They did remove the console thing though. Which really got me immersed. Also they do kinda break the immersion, then go straight back like they never said anything that would break it. That was weird. Anyway, I did enjoy this, and I plan on finishing it. However I don't believe that the price is just. I'd wait until it's on sale. It's actually what I did. But Its a fairer price than some other visual novel/dating game/Digital book types.\n\n8/10 book (A fairly good read, atleast)\n3/10 game (Not really a game to me)","January 29, 2015","true","12.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mikeoliva/recommended/239700/","mikeoliva","Motoki","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mikeoliva/","4613 products in account","This is the sequel to Analogue: A Hate Story which was a politically charged tale wrapped in the framework of a science fiction visual novel complete with cute Anime companions.\n\nYou don't need to have played Analogue to play Hate Plus but I would strongly recommend doing so as it gives you context for what happened to the world the AI came from and in particular really goes into depth about the character Hyun-ae.\n\nWhere the first game was Hyun-ae's story, this game is Mute's story. It's just as politically charged, probably even more so, and deals with the biggest mystery from Analogue, which was how a modern society reverted to conservative Neo-Confucianism ideals. If you're not familiar with Asian culture at all the nearest Western equivalent I can think of would probably be The Handmaid's Tale. This game deals with the events that lead up to that big change.\n\nIf it sounds serious, it is. And it isn't. It's all told through the personal journals and political council meeting minutes. In particular there several different people whose stories you follow over a series of years and get to see how the subtle and not so subtle changes to their society affect them.\n\nThere are also some really fun, light hearted moments with the AI companions including one where you are asked to bake a cake. In real life with a real recipe and then further are encouraged to take a picture of your cake with your companion and send it to the developer to get an achievement. It's all real and I have the achievement to prove it. It was a refreshingly fun meta moment to the game and there are a few others as well like a when the AI cheekily break the fourth wall at rare moments.\n\nThere are three main paths which in turn lead to multiple different endings depending on the choices you made. While the texts you read through are the same, the tone and the events that happen with your AI companion(s) are completely different so it really is worth playing through each of the 3 paths at least once.\n\nThe game takes place what's supposed to be a small spaceship that you, the space investigator, are on with your AI companion on a 3 day trip back to Earth where you both try to piece together the mystery of the Mugunghwa (the ship that Analogue took place on).\n\nEach path is divided into 3 days where on each day you can only extract a certain number of logs before the ships battery is drained and needs to be recharged requiring you to wait 12 hours. So yes the game does ask you to play the game in installments over the course of 3 days. However there is a way out where once you power down and save you can hover your mouse over that save file, hit the 'S' key and then continue. Note if you do this you cannot get one of the achievements though.\n\nAnother alternative is to play day 1 of one path, then day 1 of the other, then day 1 of the 3rd, then 12 hours+ later do day 2 path 1, day 2 path 2 etc. This is what I ended up doing. I think it works well and gives a nice immediate contrast between the differing paths.\n\nOne of the changes in Hate Plus is you now get hyper links when people's names are mentioned that gives an image (in realistic art style) of the person with a commentary description from the AI. This made a big difference for me personally as I not only was able to keep track of the names better but also felt like I connected with them more.\n\nAnother change is that the AI are reading the logs in Hate Plus for the first time along with you and you get their reactions and commentary that really run the gamut. Even when going back through the documents you already read for the other paths you'll want to scroll through all of it to get the AI reactions because they do differ for each path.\n\nIf you do all the paths the game should take somewhere between 9-12 hours, which may vary depending upon how slow/fast of a reader you are, how much time you spend to stop and bake a cake, etc.\n\nOverall I would highly recommend Hate Plus to anyone who enjoyed Analogue, has in interest in visual novels or is just looking for a strongly story oriented game.","August 26, 2013","true","14.2"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

I will try to keep it to low-key spoilers, but be warned regardless.\n\nI'm not as impressed with this game as opposed to its predecessor. The original was a tragedy about how a regressed society can put their nail in their own coffin to seal their ultimate demise by being too rigid in their beliefs. The premise behind this game is in a similar vein; it shows how an advanced society based on future technology can regress down to pre-modern times.\n\nThe story itself is pretty good. The council of the Mugunghwa has a major problem threatening to revolutionize the government aboard the ship. A movement has been gaining steam and will hit a critical mass within a year and what the council needs is a bold plan to make this movement lose steam until it becomes a non-issue. *Mute, the security AI and one of the councillors aboard the ship, has a bold plan in mind. It sounds great in theory, but there's one problem with this:\n\nThe plan involves putting Councillor Ryu, Councillor of Captaincy, to the Chief Councillor seat.\n\nWhy is this a bad thing? Because Ryu is the man who, seven years later, will overthrow the government and create the regressed, patriarchal society that would eventually cause the downfall of the ship.\n\nThis isn't a major spoiler by any means. If you start on *Mute's route, she will make it known immediately that this is the man who became the first Emperor of the new society.  The main story is how this man slowly took over the government over seven long years in order to create the perfect society of his choosing.\n\nThe other main feature of this game over the predecessor is how much more emphasis it places on society outside of the primary plotline. It shows a famous actress who falls in love with a peasant girl, and eventually loses both her love and her career to the changing society. Another woman who slowly figures out why the shipwide birth rate is steadily decreasing despite everything else in her life doing its best to prevent it. A nobleman who falls in love with another man only to have his heart broken. Society and how it changes over these several years causes huge shifts in these people's lives, and the setting feels very fleshed out and deliberate as a result. This is an excellent way to use non-linear storytelling, and I have to commend Love for how this was done.\n\nSo why exactly did I give this a non-recommended rating?\n\nIt's simple. Outside of the logs themselves, the game is a huge step down. The AIs in the original story had very clear reasons for being there and their stories in of themselves were a big part of what made it so deep and enjoyable. The sequel... much less so. *Mute has an interesting storyline since she has no memory of anything that her former self had done in any of these logs, plus all the cultural things that don't fit what she thinks is right (having only experienced the post-government takeover) makes her a much more respectable character than she was in the original. Something happens that throws a wrench in this completely, however, and that ruins the suspence for me.\n\nHyun-Ae... I don't even know what happened. Her personality from the first game is intact and shines through, but that's all there is here. There's nothing that stands out about her that *Mute doesn't already have except for the fact that she takes her relationship with the protagonist investigator very seriously.\n\nThat by itself isn't negative, but it arises with one of my biggest pet peeves this game hits: forcing people to wait.\n\nI personally hate this design choice and I don't feel it was the optimal one here. The primary draw is the story inside the log files, but the story outside of them is still a big part of what made the original game good. Love clearly tries to have the same effect in the sequel, but the forced waiting comes off to me as trying way too hard to force it. The mandatory 12 hour wait between log sessions (of which there are 3; I'm fully aware there is a skip button, but it's very clearly meant to be played without using it) arbitrarily breaks up the story. I'm not entirely sure what kind of emotional buttons its trying to press, which is worrying when annoyance is the primary emotion I was feeling. The other big issue is the very beginning of Day 3 in Hyun-Ae's route, where she forces you to wait several minutes using the subtext of expecting you to bake a cake. It's very clear what Love was going for by having this in the game, but it's extremely awkwardly placed (come on, I started day 3 to finish reading all the logs... I have to WAIT now?) and it feels like a shallow attempt to force Hyun-Ae's route to have some meat to it. It's not conducive to good characterization in my eyes and it ruins the flow of the story more than it already has.\n\nI haven't played the harem route yet and I won't until I decide I want to go for the nine day achievement, so I will refrain from commenting on it here.\n\nAll in all, this is a good sequel if you want just to know the context as to why the Mugunghwa was so far in the past in the original. Otherwise, this isn't worth the money in my eyes.","February 9, 2015","false","8.6"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","1"

It's just... sterile. Poorly presented overall. None of the characters really have any weight in the story, it's all reading about things that happened in the past that neither character was there to experience, so it doesn't matter much who you pick because the end result is about the same. Why couldn't we, maybe, have a story told from *Mute's perspective leading up to the event that caused Year 0? It would make it a lot more compelling than reading through a lot of logs with an AI companion making comments on stuff. Meh.\n\nThe story itself is alright, there's a lot of characters to keep track of and they all have names that are kind of hard to remember but there's a few characters than stand out as more important, so I guess it's fine. Nothing ever really gets resolved in the side-plots though. I mean there are implications given the nature of what comes next, but... ehh. The central story is pretty decent though, a lot of politics but not without a point, and the characters are pretty strong even without any direct interaction between them and the player.\n\nThe forced wait between days is also possibly for the better as I don't know if I could stomach just reading through logs for too long, I'd probably be waiting anyways. It's not a game for long sittings anyways, unlike Analogue which could easily and most likely would be completed in one sitting. But that had a variety of gameplay elements, reading over (shorter) logs, interacting with the console, interacting with the AI... that's the thing, there's not much to interact with here, compared to Analogue. I don't know why that's the case.\n\nOverall I'm left just feeling very meh about this. It feels haphazardly thrown together because the author wanted to continue the story but didn't have any ideas for a game. I'd give it a slight recommendation if you've read Analogue already but otherwise there's no reason to get this one.","January 28, 2015","true","9.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Like its predecessor, it can be strident and clunky, but I still enjoy the basic "gameplay" of reading documents and having an observer comment on them. The "can only play one segment per day" works better than it sounds. Sweet dreams. Don't know how I feel about the scolding "cake" segment, although I might feel better about it if I felt better about Hyun-ae. Carried over issue from the last game: Mute has a couple more shades of complexity, while Hyun-ae remains a bit too cute and victimy. The game wants you to save her and keep her from crying, which, while justified with her actual(?) age, doesn't really do much to deconstruct Hyun-ae as "mai waifu." Liked the documents generally, but felt the conspiracies and counter-conspiracies whiffed a bit by the end. While meant to depict slippery slopeism of eroding rights, the way some things play out make our heroes seem less "not psychic" and more "a touch incompetent," which would be helped by a little more detail, I think. Also, bad guys needed that touch more complexity, and, and. Love's games never quite hit for me, but I always have a nice time, and I'm glad they're out there.","October 26, 2013","true","7.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Following a while after the events of Analogue, you are tasked into another starship known as the White Princess to uncover the mysteries behind the rise of the New Joseon Dynasty that plagued Mugunghwa for centuries. You will go through all of the message logs left by the former crew and population of Mugunghwa, arraging from business meetings to just normal-day cuddling, working and everyday stuff.\n\nThis game should be played AFTER completing Analogue: A Hate Story at least ONCE, since you can transfer your Analogue data (providing you've completed the game within that save data) into the game to stay up to date and have a better understanding of the game's lore.\nOf course, should you choose to start differently as opposed to how you finished Analogue, you can start a new walkthrough with different settings, from choosing between *Hyun-ae or *Mute and adjusting their behaviour towards you.\n\nThe only flaw (if it should be considered as such) is the time delay between each "game day": after consuming the White Princess' emergency power by copying logs and reading them, you will have to wait for 12h of IRL time to advance to the next day, and thus be able to extract more messages. This method breaks the flow and pace of the game, and it really, REALLY sucks, even before the final day.\nThat being mentioned, the game's soundtrack fits really well with the atmosphere, let it be reading a whole dark, novel-sized text log or conversations between you and your AI companion. Plus, if you're an otaku, like me, you will feel yourself even more connected to your partner, should it be either the sympathetic, platonic *Hyun-ae or the wise-cracking, stoic *Mute.\n\nOverall, Hate Plus should be recommended to those who have played Analogue: A Hate Story and want to further expand the storyline, who love Christine Love's handiwork of the story or those that just like visual novels.","April 5, 2014","true","5.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198055248625/recommended/239700/","76561198055248625","prinny fever","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198055248625/","266 products in account","tl;dr: Hate Plus is brilliant, Christine Love is a rising talent, you'll get more out of this game if you play Analogue first.  If you're hesitant, but like scifi, or even just character drama, then you won't be disappointed.\n\n\nIt's hard to define the target demographic for this game.  As a visual novel, it doesn't fit the traditional model of "game" that applies to most games on steam.  However, Hate Plus is one of the most entertaining and captivating "experiences" I've had with gaming in many years, in a similar vein to Gone Home, except profoundly darker.\n\nAs I see it, Hate Plus can be considered in at least three ways.  On the surface, it's a political thriller masked as a scifi story; in this way, it rather differs from Analogue, which was predominantly family drama as scifi, with politics hinted at in the background.  This shift mirrors the change in focus of the game away from *Hyun-ae, onto *Mute.  After Analogue, I wasn't sure I ever wanted to think about poor *Mute again, but Hate Plus has thoroughly converted me on this front: I don't know how much of *Mute's backstory existed during the writing of Analogue, but it's certainly possible Christine Love has executed a feat of retconning.  Old *Mute is among the most fascinating characters in gaming, and her ultimate demise is fittingly substantive and impactful.  I think politics with the window trappings of scifi has become rather more popular in visual media recently, and Hate Plus certainly continues this trend.  Of course, as this is Old *Mute's story, there is some contemplation of the nature of AI longevity (and culpability, as was mostly ignored, frankly, in Analogue); but for the most part this is a story of politics and the systematic deprivation of rights under the rule of a narcissist.  Which isn't to say the game moralizes, and only in retrospect does it strike me how ambiguous the game can be on this front: pre-retro-Joseon and post- are both deeply flawed societies, but simply in different ways; somehow Love for the most part seems to withhold judgment, or at least give the reader room to make their own decisions.\n\nOf course, Hate Plus, as Analogue before it, can be considered a meditation on love, hate, and a surprisingly bleak fatalism: since most of the action takes place in the past, all stories are fated to end in sadness, and hope is ultimately doomed.  I know this sounds bleak, but it does accurately represent my experience with the game.  Nevertheless, the novel is absolutely captivating: it is rare to find more humane and complex portraits of (especially female) characters in video games.  It has been months since I played Hate Plus, and yet characters such as Kim So-Yi and Mae Jin-a have stuck with me: they are so lovingly portrayed that it's difficult to look away from their struggles.  It's a sign of a truly gifted author that this fiction has stuck with me more than most mainstream "scifi"  in many years.  Love is certainly not ambivalent about the personal humanity of all actors in her story, regardless of their (often disastrous) choices.\n\nSpeaking of the author, it's worth noting that Hate Plus is the next in the series of "Christine Love Trolls Steam Users" games.  In Analogue, she tricked everyone into working with a trimmed-down Linux shell; for Hate Plus, time is her manipulation of choice.  Many reviews have commented on the mixed success of the time restrictions of the game (a save file is linked to the system clock, and won't let you continue the game after a certain number of logs have been read on a given day; and cake).  I shared their opinion for some time, but ultimately I think Love is successful at her undertaking: the forced gaps (barring changing your system time; and cake) actually rather increased my interest in the game, by letting me ruminate on the mysterious disasters that strike the characters in the past.  Ultimately, as with everything in gaming, you will get out what you put into Hate Plus: Love asks you to interact with the game in a way that requires time and effort and movement off the couch, and while many people will manipulate the game to skip these sequences, I highly recommend that you participate as Love intends.  It becomes clear after a proper 9-day playthrough that Love has created a game that is more than simply a visual novel; she has managed to overcome some of the limitations of visual novels and Ren'Py by compelling the reader to actually act out a role in her (or "our") story.\n\nFinally, it's worth noting: great music, except for the 45 minutes of cake elevator music which made me want to throw my computer out the window.  And the art is FABULOUS; not the anime-style art, which is fine but rather standard, but the sketches of characters.  What a brilliant addition post-Analogue; they add life and depth to what otherwise could be a tedious stream of faceless names.\n\nIn sum: a great game, which I hope in spite of all odds finds broad success on a platform on which it is a novelty.  I highly recommend.","November 27, 2013","true","12.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The differences between the two with respect to game design are fairly minor but I personally found the story in Hate Plus to be much more riveting, which is no small feat.  Whereas a few story arcs in Analogue fell a bit flat for me, Hate Plus had no such weakness.  I would also say the plot is more intricate, warranting an entire second read just to pick up on details you couldn't have possibly seen before.\nFair warning: this is a tragedy.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/segoli/recommended/239700/","segoli","segoli","http://steamcommunity.com/id/segoli/","1383 products in account","Hate Plus is the most immersive game ever released. I don't say that lightly, and it's not at all hyperbole; whereas other games try to forget that the player character and the player are different entities, Hate Plus actually merges the two together into a unified whole. Christine Love's games have managed to do this in the past, but Hate Plus takes it further in absolutely incredible ways. You're playing a character who is using a computer, and occasionally, your character has to stop doing what they're doing for a while, and occasionally, your character has to get up and do things away from the computer, but in fact, you're the one doing all those things. You're the one at the computer; you're the one who will have to take breaks from playing at certain intervals; you're the one who will have to do things away from your computer in real life. If you enjoy The Stanley Parable, you'll probably enjoy Hate Plus for some of the same reasons, though whereas the whole point of the former is the innovative gameplay, in Hate Plus it fades into the background, playing an important role in the experience without being the whole point.\n\nThat's not even mentioning the storyline, of course, which is one of the most engaging and unique to appear in a videogame ever. It's extremely reminiscent of Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale, while taking the themes present in that in new, interesting directions. It's both a very good work of literature and a very good work of science fiction, and it's all wrapped up in a very good game. It might seem at times like there's really not much gameplay at all in Hate Plus, but that's because it's integrated directly into the naturalistic choices the game has you make, things that normally don't even seem like decisions. It's unlikely that your experience will be anything like anyone else's when you play, and the way the story unfolds is 100% up to how you let it unfold, and yet you might not ever notice this happening. This is simultaneously better than games that give you really blatantly obvious dialogue trees, where the choices you make are completely explicit, and better than games where the story essentially progresses at random. If you find yourself frustrated playing games like (and this isn't to say either of these games are bad, because they're not) Mass Effect for how much the game beats you over the head with the implications of your choices or Dear Esther because the direction the story takes place in, while unique for each player, isn't one that for the most part can be said to be chosen by the player, then you'll be pleasantly surprised by the middle ground that Hate Plus forges between these two extremes.\n\nHate Plus is careful never to make the mechanical structure behind the game totally apparent, so it's far easier to get lost in the experience. The end result is a game that genuinely makes you feel like you're a part of the world of the game without feeling like it's shouting "hey! Look at this! You're part of the game!", and it certainly doesn't hurt that the story it allows you to be a part of is one of the best, most nuanced ones to ever appear in a game. Also, don't fret if you've not played the previous game, Analogue: A Hate Story; while there is a bundle of both of the games that includes the soundtracks, and it's more than worth the cost to get both, there's nothing in Hate Plus that demands that you have played the first game, so if you're unable to get both, don't feel like you're missing out on anything crucial to the experience; while there are obviously plenty of plot points that are continued, they're continued in such a way that you can rest assured that you won't have missed anything that is necessary to fully enjoy Hate Plus.

For all intents and purposes, I completely forgot that I was in fact, playing a video game. If that isn't a testament to how good this game's writing is, I don't know what is.\n\nThis game is also a sequel to Analogue: A Hate Story, so as such, my reccomendation is simple:\nIf you enjoyed the first game, play this without question. If you haven't played the first one, either play that game right now or tell me why you are reading this.\n\nA few thoughts on the differences from the first game:\nI'd actually argue that the writing in Hate Plus is even better than Analogue: A Hate Story. It's certainly better paced thanks to the three day system. No doubt that mechanic was inspired by Majora's Mask, but I think it actually works better here than it did in Zelda... save for the fact that there's no time travel. The game actually locks you out of playing after progressing a certain amount. You are literally meant to play this game over the course of three real world days.\n\nForcing you to stop playing after a certain amount of time causes you to think more about what little plot you know so far, and considering gameplay mostly consists of reading paragaphs upon paragraphs of writing, taking a break is helpful. Also the breaks help immerse you more in the experience. You're not just reading a novel here. This game has so much more to offer beyond just that.\n\nAlso the addition of more art is a major improvement over the original. Nearly all of the characters you're reading about over the course of the game each have a portrait you can view, which again, adds more to the experience of this being more than just a book.\n\nAnd the soundtrack is even better than the original's IMO. Although the lack of a simulated terminal interface this time around makes me a little sad, that would also have to be the only complaint I have.\n\nI love this game. I love this series. I really hope one day we'll be able to see a third installment.","February 19, 2014","true","19.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Continues where the previous game left off (you can even import your save data from it.) The gameplay has been reworked, being more streamlined than the previous game. The AI characters will give their thoughts as you read through each message, rather than having to switch to them. There's also portraits and summaries of characters that you'll read about, which is a great addition. The story focuses heavily on character relationships and political struggles. You can theoretically play this without having played the first, but you will miss out on a lot (especially if you want to get all of the different endings.) Took me ~6 hours to get through the story once (although the game is split in 3 segments and each segment is supposed to be played with 12 REAL-TIME hours in-between.)

You can see some tragedies happen merely randomly, yet some happen due to lack of aknowledgment. We can seem them and their impending doom, yet we do nothing, we don't react. Instead we are often re-active; cleaning up after a great tradgedy while we promise and swear it will never happen again.\n\nWithout spoiling the game I'll try to talk about it with only one spoiler here and now: if you want a complete (note the word complete) happy ending, then this game is just not for you. If you enjoy reading; this game is for you. If you enjoy pressing the space bars during cutscenes in games, this probably not for you.\n\nThis game goes off of the orginal game "Analogoue a Hate Story" with Hyun-ae as your guide. She is pretty much the same but after you read some story logs you kind of get the sense that she is a thirsty bit.... I mean a repectable woman with respectable sexual urges. *cough* She wants the D.\n\nAs always, the ship is in a low-power state which is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ annoying in this game.... Because here is how the game was designed. You get about 30% battery each day, after you extract documents it reduces the battery until it reaches 0%. When it reaches 0% you can't play anymore and have to come back in like 12-24 hours (forget how many, but it's long) to extract more documents because the power needs to refill. While it's a cool concept it's pretty damn annoying. Yes, I know you can change the system time, but I really don't want to ♥♥♥♥ with my computers time because knowing me I wont change it back and miss something important.\n\nAs for the story with this one, it is truly amazing. It is filled with all sorts of different mini stories that seem to have no importance until later on when they all string together. I have to note that this game seems to have taken an erotic twist with the writing. Not sure WHY, but I can't complain or my ♥♥♥♥♥ either. Be warned there is a gay couple that you see that makes you want to turn gay. God.. Where did I put my ♥♥♥♥ing corndog.\n\nI need to play more to see if there are alternate endings, but I beleive there are (hence the different choices you can respond to when promted a queston by Hyun-ae). The first game had some sweet endings which I really liked....\n\nAnyways, I've seen alot of anime fans feature this game in their profiles because its related to anime but they never play it (which is slightly irritating and a waste of $8), to those people I challenge you to play at least 2 hours on the game before you put it down for good. It's a different kind of game from your usual FPS, yes. But try something new and relaxing for once. There are no leaderboards, no timelimits, (more like time-wasters), no co-op, just play the damn thing to enjoy it. The creator put thought into it more so than a typical activision worker and isn't getting half the money.","September 4, 2013","true","10.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","2"

This is the sequel/addon to Analogue: A Hate Story, and, just like a sequel normally does, continues the story from its prequel. After rescuing *Hyun-ae or/and *Mute, you can use your savestate of Analogue and start your journey back to earth with all your gathered information and new waifu. But - because you're a handsome space investigator - you do not slack off during your travel home; no, you go further into investigating instead (and bake a cake).\n\nIn Hate Plus you get to know what happened on the Mugungwha before the year 0; what exactly happened that society got so old-fashioned; the missing piece in the story of Analogue. I won't write how exactly the story goes, in order to not spoil it for anyone who hasn't played it yet. But I'm willing to say that the story is awesome and matches perfectly with the story of the prequel. Everything fits, though you have to be prepared that this story offers a quite different atmosphere, since society hasn't regressed yet; it feels a bit more modern. You may also need to be interested in at least a little bit of politics, since you will read a lot about it here; if you're not, this game may not be as easy to read for you - it could (and possibly will) get a bit boring then.\n\nThe soundtrack is - just as in its prequel - good, absolutely fitting and decent. If you liked the soundtrack of Analogue, you will like this one too, and it's totally worth its money. (Though, Analouge's soundtrack was way catchier)\n\nI strongly recommend this game to everyone who played Analogue and liked *Hyun-ae or *Mute. Though, you have to keep  in mind that this is an addon. It's not really a standalone game, it's an addon. I say this, because sometimes I get the feeling that it's just not as good as Analogue was; so if you ever get this feeling too, just remember: it's basically just an addon. So, everything's fine. Besides, there's no point in playing Hate Plus, if you didn't play Analogue. But I feel like I'm starting to ramble here, am I not?\nSo, if you liked Analogue, get this game in your cart already and continue investigating!","November 22, 2014","true","15.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

A Story of Refinement and Betrayal.Genre: Anime Visual Novel.\nDeveloped & Published by: Love Conquers All Games\nPlatform: Windows, Mac OSX and Linux.\nBusiness Model: Base Game.\nCopy Purchased by Myself Overall Story Thoughts\nThe sequel to A Hate Story is still based on the same concept of the original. You’re an investigator who hacked into the Mugunghwa, a colony ship that lost contact with Earth a long time ago, and you managed to save an AI(s) from the doomed vessel. Like in the previous game, they can talk to you but you can’t talk to them due to an installation error/mcguffin. You do have a few more options in what you can say but they still boil down to: yes/no/maybe. This time around, the AI has more log files from the colony ship that you didn’t get to see in the previous game. These logs have clues into what caused the enactment of the oppressive society and then the eventual events that you read about in the previous title. So, it’s time to find out what happened. This time around, the AI will actively read the logs with you and provide colorful commentary every now and again. This is especially amusing if you rescued both Hyun-ae & Mute from a previous save game. So, read the logs and find out what happened.\n\nThis game seems easier to follow than the previous one. The game provides a photo (for most) and profile for characters to help you keep track of who’s who. Logs are still setup to be read at your own pace and in the order of your choosing. That said, the game makes sure that they’re relevant regardless of when you read them. There aren’t any notes on pronunciation (which I found to be helpful in the previous game) and the two family trees aren’t listed. Probably because it wasn’t the main focus of this story. Overall, the story is about the same as the previous game in terms of how densely it uses lore, name usage and politics. Which is a bit more than the average story. But this time, you have a more solid grounding of what’s going on with the characters. Even if you’re new to this series, you’ll be brought up to speed quickly enough.\n\nReal World Time Mechanic\nThere’s a real world aspect to this game that I haven’t seen before. The store page states that it will take three days in order to finish this game. The in-game reason is that your ship is running on emergency power and has to recharge after every document extraction. So, the game will have you wait 12 real world hours before it lets you continue to the next chapter. You get about 1-2 hours per chapter. I think this will be a love/hate mechanic with a lot of people. I like it because I treat these games as something to wind down to before I go sleep, so, it gives me the right moment to save and shutdown for the night. But on the other hand, you have to wait before you can complete the game and you can’t finish the game in one go. I’m sure if you meddled with your PC’s clock, you could do it one finish. But then, where’s the fun in that? Some will like this, other’s will see it as an unnecessary inconvenience. It’s up to you to decide which way you go.\n\nPC Settings\nExpected genre settings are here. Text speed, animations on or off and English/Korean language. Audio sliders for music and effects are available as well. Resolutions are still restricted to 1024x640 and 1024x600. I still think those are odd resolution choices but the game scales well so I can’t complain. The UI has gone through some UI changes but keeps much of the same setup the previous game had. However, there’s an odd flickering to the UI that happens once in a while which seems to be intentional. I don’t like it because it’s more distracting than immersive. Additionally, scrolling through logs has an odd, frequent pause while reading it, especially when you have two AIs with you while reading. This seems to be caused by the frequent changes in the facial expressions of the AIs and the game checking to see if it needs to display their comments or not. It’s not a big deal. Game is stable and bug free as far as I can tell.\n\nAI Characters\nIt continues where you left off, allowing you to load the save from the previous game or start fresh, letting you set which AI you saved and what their attitude is towards you. Hyun-ae & Mute get even more time to develop their character and backstory, though more of the focus is on Mute and what happened to her. I really like that they get to actively participate in the reading of the logs rather than sit in the background and come out every now and again to give their two cents.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nWhile the sequel doesn't get as dark as it’s predecessor, it still paints a disturbing story of culture change and betrayal. The mystery, the futuristic setting and serious dark tone are still well executed. Maintaining it’s sci-fi atmosphere with the music and futuristic UI glues all the pieces together for a great experience in the AVN genre. Hate Plus gets a recommendation from this Paladin.\n\nRead my review and more on A Paladin Without A Crusade[wp.me]\nA Paladin’s Steam Review: Analogue: A Hate Story","April 11, 2015","true","7.1"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ksempac/recommended/239700/","ksempac","Ksempac","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ksempac/","303 products in account","Analogue : A Love Story was an interesting game, a visual novel that wasn't just focused on romance with a bunch of NPC. It had an interesting, original setting, and the goal of the game was to solve a mystery, rather than pursue a romance. Romance was there for people who wanted it, but it was definitely optional.\n\nUnfortunately, its sequel, Hate Plus, deals with what happened far into the past. Thus, you know the setting, you know how it ends, and it's just a matter of reading about the details. There is not enough to capture the attention, you're stuck reading a bunch of stories which just do not have enough in them to keep your interest alive. Besides the main "story", most (all ?) of the other are related to love and relationships, which are fine subject, but I think they each lose their individual interest when all of them shares the same topic. The game actually asks you to pace yourself, forcing you to log off from time to time, but every time i did that, I was losing even more interest (at one point I forgot about the game for a week before logging back in).\n\nSo you know the ending before you start, and if you're not very interested by the stories, what is left ? The AI from the first game. They are with you, but you already know their personal story. So it now comes down to their reaction to what you're reading and your "relationship" with them. That's where the game becomes really creepy. That's where it goes back to the full romance system of most visual novels, the thing that Analogue had cleverly managed to avoid. Either you approve to what they say or ask, or the game makes you feels like a jerk.\n\nI'm not sure if there is a middle road somewhere, but it's possible. I just can't be bothered to find out due to all the forced steps and pauses needed to do it. Especially when sometimes, there are conversations where none of the dialog choices are what you would actually want to say.\n\nAnother creepy part of the game is related specifically to Mute*. The way she react to what happened to the ship, as it was before her times, and thus she had different values. I know she is extremely conservative but having her disparaging every single story gets tiresome. Page after page about romances Mute disapproves of...Once again the clever writing of Analog has become way too black and white, because the context, of having to solve a mystery and getting away from the endangered ship, isn't there any more to balance things out.\n\nSo while I heartily recommend "Analogue : A True Story" to anyone playing games, my advice is to skip Hate Plus. Despite an improved UI, it has lost the good pacing and the balanced approach of the first game, replacing it with creepy AI, a weird fixation on maids and other visual novels tropes.","September 28, 2015","false","6.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Therefore it is not suitable for children and early-teens.\n\nAlthough I'd highly recommend the first game: Analogue: A Hate Story, I can't say the same for this. First thing first, it makes no sense playing this before finishing the first game.\n\nThis novel is a pre-sequel to the first game, where you read to uncover the mystery of how the backwards society was formed for the first game, and the reason behind the mysterious void in the ship's history.\n\nI hate how the game has a timer that forces player to stop playing after a while. Although this can be cheated by changing the system time, I feel this game mechanic is stupid. Also, the bake-a-cake session also forces you to wait unless you specifically select the bad dialog option to skip the baking session.\n\nUnlike the first game where the story is crafted to unfold based on the "unreliable narrator" nature of the AI, this game lets you choose which part of the logs you want to read without telling you the optimal order to read them. I find myself keep switching between different main characters, making it very hard to keep track of the plot lines.\n\nAs a visual novel, I also hate how the game don't have a place to let me re-read all the logs at the end to get a better understanding at the full story. Unlike the first game where I get to re-read all the logs in an extra menu that are grouped and sorted by the time and setting, this game do not have that feature (or at least I cannot find it anywhere).\n\nThe story itself is okay. They lost the mysterious element from the first game, but added a lot of revelation moment. However the AI partners do not have the same level of personality anymore. In my opinion, this game should be released as a DLC for the first game rather than a standalone title.\n\nFor achievement hunterThis game has one unattainable acheivement. It was intentionally designed to be unachievable by the developer. So if you aim for 100% completion, it is not possible without cheating.\n\nAlso, there is one other achievement requires you to do something outside of the game itself, and is outside of the player's control (you need to send an email to the developer and wait for their reply).\n\nSo you can forget about 100% completion and just enjoy the game itself.\n\nMy score: 5/10","October 22, 2015","false","7.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

You have to walk through Analogue: A Hate Story and continue the save. Or at least play the Hate Story. While the previous game was about.. well, hate and traditional society, this is mostly about sex.\n\nThe previous game had lots of letters written somewhere after Year 300. Now you've found lots of letters before Year 0. Why did they reset the calendar? Turns out... well, politics. Now you have 3 realtime days to read all these letters.\n\nBased on your previous save, you have up to two AIs. Hyun-ae is a girl who's extremely curious about sex. It doesn't help that you'll be reading light LGBT erotica here. She comments every single lewd phrasing. Mute is a girl who is extremely "conservative" and shy about sex, so she also comments each time you're reading something lightly romantic. And also turns out she has a rough past, so her route is much more interesting but that comes in play only on Day 3.\n\nThe VN is good-looking but the look won against the common sense. There are lots of clunky animations. Even with full animation off, you'll have to wait for each menu to fade in. Also you read each text with your AI pals - that's a nice touch, they react to the letters but they also are a big distraction.\n\nThere is also a gameplay aspect that opposes common sense. You play in real time. After you read the first 9 letters, you actually have to "power down" your ship, save and wait 12 realtime hours to continue the game. As a result, you can feel compelled to start two walkthroughs at the same time - that's totally okay but you'll crack open all the mysteries earlier and the game would become just MORE boring.\n\nHate Plus is packed with text and this prose is a lazy one. Every POV character (except two) is gay, bi or asexual. This can be strongly hinted at but mostly you just read it in plain text. The only straight characters write about sex problems and sex offenders. Also every POV character is a tragic one. This comes out the wrong way because the combination of messages "she suppressed her gay nature" and "she lived her miserable life to the end" tells something I don't think the author wanted to tell here. Also I don't reckon much about the future packed with lesbians.\n\nThe game is simply boring, especially Hyun-ae route. There is no big decision to make. You just sit for 3 days, read a lot of text, have some talk with your AI pal, you can bake a cake for her and that's that. It's a weak try to give the previous game some closure, nothing else.","April 15, 2015","false","8.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You should be the one to do this, because you're a man, and men are really smart, while women are dumb! I managed to count the apples in this bowl, even though I'm a woman and therefore bad at math!

If you have not played Analogue yet, stop reading this review right now and go play that game instead. Without the background of that story, Hate Plus has very little to offer you. If you have played through Analogue already, and earned the super-secret harem ending, I implore you to NOT choose the Harem route for your first play through of Hate Plus! Instead, play through *Mute and *Hyun-Ae's stories first. In many ways the Harem route is the most interesting (because you can see the interplay of the two heroines), but tackling that route first is like eating your dessert before your dinner...you'll lose your apetite to go back and miss out on the real meat of the story as a result.\n\nRecommended route order: *Mute, *Hyun-ae, harem.\n\nWith that public service message out of the way, on to my real review. Hate Plus is a surprising follow-up to Analogue: A Hate Story. There's a lot to dislike about this follow-up. For as little gameplay as the original had, Hate Plus has even less. You won't find any command line puzzles to work through, and unlocking and reading logs doesn't feel nearly as interactive or satisfying. Instead of having a dialogue with your AI companion, you merely select the article you want to read from a list, and dig through the records at your leisure. As a result, the experience is less curated and directed, and doesn't have the same air of mystery that the original game seemed to embody.\n\nDespite that, there's still a lot to recommend this game. Hate Plus answers all the questions that the first Visual Novel raised, and adds in the very interesting character of "Old *Mute" who plays a prominent role in the history of the Mugunghwa. And while the flow of the game isn't as tightly curated as a traditional Christine Love game, the story is incredibly fascinating when approached appropriately. (Pro-tip, Try your best to read the logs chronologically.) Moreover, the interactions with the AI really shine, and are really what make the game worthwhile. *Hyun-Ae will make you question the nature of fictional characters and artificial love, while *Mute will open her own can of worms.\n\nUltimately, if you liked Analogue and find yourself thirsting for more info about the Mugunghwa's slide into Neo-Confucianism, Hate Plus will certainly scratch that itch.","June 15, 2014","true","15.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The anguish and betrayal and lost love are written so very well that it's hard not to feel like you're being stabbed in the chest.\n\nBut it's worth it to keep going.\n\nThe story also teaches us, in-story and in a very meta way, that you can't always have everything.

Luckily the forum users have found a way around this one. Another achievement requires you to play the game over the course of 9 days.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/amedeus8/recommended/239700/","amedeus8","Comrade St. Nikolai","http://steamcommunity.com/id/amedeus8/","779 products in account","Following up on Analogue: A Hate Story, Hate Plus is a game about reading the records of a dead spaceship society alongside your female AI companion(s) in order to piece together just what screwed it all up. In Analogue, we learned about why the entire population of the ship died following a stint as a weird emperor-and-male-superiority-centric culture (I am told that this is reminiscent of Korea's Joseon Dynasty; as I don't know Korean history, I will take the Internet's word on this). In Hate Plus, we seek to dig deeper into the ship's history and find out what caused this cultural regression in the first place.\n\nHate Plus was initially conceived as a DLC for Analogue, but quickly grew too large to be contained in an add-on. Thus, Hate Plus became its own game, though still very much connected to the original. If you have a save from a completed game of Analogue, you can continue from it in Hate Plus, with the same AI(s) you ended with, viewing you in the same light that you left them viewing you in. If you haven't played Analogue, or didn't keep an ending save, never fear! Hate Plus will ask you a series of questions to get you going so you can pretend like you've been here, all along.\n\nWhich gets us to the gameplay. Just like Analogue, 95% of the game is spent reading document after document after document. But where Analogue had a cool command line puzzle bit towards the end, Hate Plus is pretty much just reading. When you're not reading documents, you'll be reading what your AI pal has to say, and occasionally picking responses from a dialogue wheel.\n\nEffort has been made to make the AIs seem more natural, this time around. When you hover over a choice, their facial expression changes as they anticipate which answer you'll give. And instead of clicking a button to hear their thoughts after each document, they're ever-present through the full read. This is... kind of good, kind of bad.\n\nWhen the AI has something interesting to say, it's nice to see it pop up on the side. Although it does carry the problem that they react to what's just scrolled onto the bottom of the screen, while I prefer to keep the text I'm reading at the top of the screen. Plus I did accidentally scroll too far and cause the AI's observations to permanently disappear on a couple occasions. But the big problem I have with it is that the AIs just often have nothing important to say. This is especially true of *Hyun-ae, whose observations seem to consist mainly of "oh"s, sentences that trail off before the important bit, and telling me how cute different relationships are.\n\nIn the first game, *Hyun-ae was a major player in the historical plot. She had a lot to say and was sad and hopeful and fascinating and informative. *Mute, on the other hand, had a strong connection to the society and culture that we were reading about, and offered an equally-fascinating antithesis to *Hyun-ae coupled with insight into how everybody who wasn't *Hyun-ae thought and acted at the time. In this game, *Mute is the major player in the plot, more or less, while *Hyun-ae is just kind of... there.\n\n*Hyun-ae's purpose (beyond pointing at things that swear and screeching, proper Invasion of the Body Snatchers style) is to play the waifu, but if anything she makes me realize what a mistake that right-guy-in-the-right-place relationship built over the course of the first game probably was. Despite managing to convince me to bake an IRL cake for a video game character, *Hyun-ae bores me. In Analogue, she was in a position of weakness, and the player was given the opportunity to play the heroic shoulder to cry on. You were given the chance to make a connection and bond with this character. But now it's a year and a half later, and the connection needs to be reestablished, and in my opinion, it's not. Though, I can't help but feel like Christine Love maybe wrote it that way on purpose, to instill all of that doubt about the basis of the AI-player waifu relationship experienced above.\n\nAnd, I mean, if so, I admit I have to respect that.\n\nNow, *Mute, on the other hand, has a much better showing during the frame story. During the course of Hate Plus, you'll read about what *Mute could be, and what she's capable of. You develop an appreciation for her personality, and she becomes a much more endearing character, despite her current misogynistic ideals. For Hate Plus, I definitely recommend taking the ride with *Mute.\n\nActually, no, that's a lie, I just lied to your face. I regret nothing.\n\nIf I have to make a recommendation about which AI to read old documents with, I'm going to recommend both. Since you could get a special ending in Analogue by beating the odds and finishing the game with both AIs, it's possible to play through Hate Plus with both. And I honestly feel like this is the playthrough that Hate Plus was built for. It's the best of both worlds. It improves on both characters' frame stories. Dull comments are largely replaced by conversations between the two. All of the interesting twists and turns from *Mute's path are available, with the bonus that you can still read Block 3 (which is never unlocked when going through with *Mute only) AS WELL AS Block 13 (which is never unlocked when going through with *Hyun-ae only). It also fixes the problem presented by *Hyun-ae being a boring waifu, as *Mute and *Hyun-ae's interactions are about as adorably tsundere as it gets. And as an added bonus, you're presented with a few fun segments reminiscent of Deus Ex: Human Revolution's social battles that are essentially the game's only puzzles.\n\nSo that's the frame story, but what about the meat of the game? What about the documents that you'll be spending most of your time reading?\n\nWell, they range from cute to interesting to pret-ty dang boring. I'd say on the whole, the story presented in Hate Plus's documents does not reach nearly the same "holy ♥♥♥♥" level of intrigue that Analogue pulled off so well. It does answer the question of what happened to cause the Mugunghwa's people to regress to a far outdated way of thinking, but I feel that the answer just isn't as astounding as I was hoping.\n\nThere are some twists and turns, relationships of all sorts, and political intrigue. One block is entirely comprised of logged conversations between important political figures that the AIs find boring. On the other hand, I think it's one of the more interesting bits to read, though that may just be because the format is easier to plow through.\n\nThe logs you'll be reading are definitely longer than in Analogue. The more boring ones can be a bit of a trudge. Block 3 is generally the last one unlocked in any route with *Hyun-ae. As such, it should be the final end-all be-all wow factor ending, but it's honestly the most boring block in the game, to me. On the other hand, *Mute gets Block 13 from the beginning. This block covers the early days of the re-Joseoned age, and I find it to be one of the more interesting blocks available.\n\nThe game does focus on some things for a bit too long. I'm no stranger to writing far too much (I mean, wow, are you actually still reading this review?), but sometimes the documents just go and go and go. Most of Blocks 1 and 2 are dedicated to young people falling in and out of love, and I'd go so far as to say that, while the actual personalities of the people differ, the main relationships of Block 1 and Block 2 are similar enough to be a little redundant (though still cute to read about).\n\nPlease don't let any of that dissuade you, though. Hate Plus may not be quite up to Analogue's standards, but the tales presented are certainly worth reading. Just, you know, they're more worth reading if you're reading them alongside *Mute. And they're the most worth reading if you're reading them alongside both *Mute and *Hyun-ae at once.\n\ni baked a cake for a video game what am i doing with my life","July 16, 2014","true","15.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A lot.\n- Fourth, and the main thing that keeps me from recommending this game whole-heartedly: WOW the narrative's treatment of *Mute's romantic preferences is really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at times. It basically feels like she's being bullied into liking women in certain situations, and while I appreciate how there's a lot of good commentary about how one's preferences are often shaped by the society in which one lives, I still feel like it could've been handled better. If you're a queer person who's ever felt pressured to feel romantic attraction to someone you're not attracted to, you're probably going to spend a lot of time wincing during *Mute's playthrough(s) if you play as a woman. Especially in the harem route.\n- And finally, once again, I recommend picking up the soundtrack.

While the events you're reading about don't require direct knowledge from the first game to understand, its impacts are significantly lessened without first experiencing Analogue.\n\nIf you did play Analogue however, you'll know more or less exactly what to expect, at least in term of its mechanics. Hate Plus, like its predecessor, is a visual novel. Long story short, you're going to spend the majority of your time reading and one shouldn't expect much else in term of traditional gameplay (and if you're going to stop reading here because of this then fair enough. Visual novels aren't going to be everyone's thing, though I urge you to at least give one or two a try if you haven't already). You assume the role of a space investigator sent to discover what has happened to a missing Derelict Generation Ship by reading numerous logs with the help of a female companion AI of your choice (or both of them, if you happen to have achieved a particular ending with Analogue). Unlike in Analogue however, your companion is also in unknown territory here, and as the result, is investigating these logs together with you, allowing her to provide interjections as you read. Once in a while, your AI will ask for a break, giving you her thoughts thus far and asking you for your take on the situation, which is one of the few instances where you're granted "agencies". It should be noted, however, that your influence is minimal, and I'm fairly certain the story will proceed to the same end regardless of your choices. While the story does provide a reasonable excuse, the linearity of the plot is likely to disappoint many people. However, I believe the helplessness that comes with the inability to communicate properly with your AI companion is intended, especially concerning a certain event that you may or may not run into depending on your choice of AI companion. The big addition, however, is that you can only beat the game in no less than 3 days. After reading a certain amount of logs, you will be unable to move on until a certain amount of time has passed. This is to provide breathing room and time to digest what you've read, which I do think is important. Many people will no doubt find this annoying, especially between day 2 and 3. You can very easily bypass this by changing your time, though I still recommend you play the game the way the developer wanted you to play it and just sit down and have a think before moving on.\n\nLess important, but still worth mentioning, are the numerous little improvements to the UI. The visual has definitely been improved, the UI looks better than ever and there are somewhat more animation. More importantly, you can actually see portraits of characters if you click on their names, not only did it create more personality for these characters, it also helped me greatly in keeping track since I'm terrible with names (one of my personal quibbles with the first game).\n\nHate Plus's plot, while taking place directly after Analogue, deals with the events that happened long before the events depicted in first game. In Analogue: A Hate Story, through reading through logs, you discover a society, despite being in a spaceship, that has degraded far from the world we know. The Mugunghwa is filled with stifling gender roles, politically backward ideals and  ignorance. In Hate Plus, you get to see the Mugunghwa before it has gotten to that point and discover how it all happened. Hate Plus centers around the security chief of the ship, Old *Mute, a much older version of one of your AI companion that she has no memory of, and the political games she played as well as her inevitable demise (this is not a spoiler, you discover a log called "The Death of Old *Mute very early on).\n\nFor a character you never actually get to see (beside one or two portraits), Old *Mute is, at least to me, a surprisingly strong character. She doesn't take ♥♥♥♥, has a sense of humor and occasionally oozes an incredibly corny air of coolness that nevertheless made me do a mental fist pump. Moreover, she is neither a villain nor hero. While she is manipulative and borderline amoral when it comes to doing her job, she shows an incredibly human side at times. This makes her eventual death all the more bitter, and *Mute's birth all the more tragic. This is why I personally recommend you play through the game the first time as *Mute, the understandably much less popular character. *Hyun-ae was the cute sidekick that is much more affable and relatable to the majority of the audience. *Mute was the chatty yet dutiful security chief of the ship that while I don't think anyone would deem evil, is nevertheless very much a product of an oppressive and dehumanizing society that she very much believes in. Analogue was *Hyun-ae's story, and Hate Plus is very much *Mute's. Her inability to comprehend a more "modern" and "liberal" way as well as her inability to accept her old self fits perfectly with the narrative and her character development. Thus, I very much believe if you're going to play through the game with *Hyun-ae, let it be your second playthrough.\n\nBecause one is assumed to have already known that the Mugunghwa will inevitably turn into what most of us perceive as an incredibly morally wrong and disturbing society, it gives the game, especially the latter parts, a sense of impending disaster and hopelessness. Whether your AI companion will end the game on a bitter or hopeful note, you know that Old *Mute and the society she lived in isn't heading toward anywhere pretty. This create many depressing moments that are genuinely hard to sit through, especially if you've chosen a certain AI companion. Personally, I believe Hate Plus to be even darker than Analogue, especially if you play through the game with *Mute. Reading through the logs depicting the lives of the Mugunghwa's citizens, the hatred, paranoia and moral degradation is present around every corner and you know it will be present at the end. Yet, thinking back on the game, I also remember moments of lighthearted romance, brief hopes, and Old *Mute's overwhelming coolness. I think that's important. Too many times, depressing stories make the mistake of staying depressing the whole way through that one eventually learn to get used to and cope with it. Hate Plus provides both moments of hopefulness and despair, and as such, when the time comes, the lighthearted moments feel so much brighter and the inevitable tragedies feel so much more tragic.\n\nSince opinions are quite polarizing when comparing the two games (I personally prefer Hate Plus), I can only offer my own take: Don't play this game if you haven't played the first, you're going to miss out on so much of the character development and the impacts of the events. Moreover, there isn't enough direct improvements to justify skipping the first game. Don't play this game if you don't care about *Mute whatsoever, she is the center of the story this time and you'd rather be involved than detached.  Don't play this game if your experience of Analogue is complete and you do not want some questions answered. Hate Plus isn't needed to complete Analogue. It builds off its predecessor into its own story, but Analogue on its own is a complete experience. That said, if you're interested in the slightest in *Mute, the Mugunghwa's backstory, or just simply some more Analogue-style visual novel about moral degradation, hatred and dehumanization, I can't recommend Hate Plus enough.\n\n(Just to be clear: A) This is my first review.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/apathogen/recommended/239700/","apathogen","SSJ4 Cory","http://steamcommunity.com/id/apathogen/","55 products in account","An interesting visual novel, something that I think really differentiates itself from the other 'moe-blob' VNs that you see in the Steam catalogue.\nPros:\n- A unique story that steers clear of simple tropes and explores archaic Asian attitudes towards issues such as sexuality and gender roles. To provide some backstory, it is recommended that Analogue: a Hate Story should be played first, though since Mute isn't exactly fleshed out a whole lot in that game, one can probably get away with playing this first.\n- Art style is fairly generic, though the sepia-photo visuals do provide some fresh realism and believability to the story.\nThe enhanced HUD from the next game is pretty nice, though some people have reported issues with it bugging out and failing to display anything. Windowed mode fixes that from memory.\n- Good soundtrack that meshes well with the material that it supports.\n- Great character development: this ties in with the story, but it's refreshing to see characters who aren't just "I'm tsundere, but really I'm actually really nice, my mum and dad died in a car crash when I was young", or "overly-exuberant moe-blob mk.2000". Both main supporting characters (or protagonists?) are very well developed, and allow NG+ playthroughs.\n\nCons:\n- Game design. The options available to you are so limited compared to the first game. Literally the entirety of the game revolves around decrypting logs, reading through them, and getting your supporting character to interact with them. You get options from a dialogue wheel to choose from, but there's none of the puzzle-solving that was available from the first game.\nThis flaw was probably the biggest disappointment I had with this game, and what really stopped me from doing a NG+ playthrough.\n\nAll in all, a great game especially in the story and visual department. The game mechanics are very bare-bones, though if you haven't played the first game and are familiar with the usual "choose this option" type of VN, you shouldn't find this a problem.\n","January 9, 2015","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I strongly recommend playing that first as the events in this game would not make much sense otherwise.\n\nMuch like its predecessor, Hate Plus has you reading through logs to find out what happened in the past.  If you liked Analogue, you’ll like this.  This time you explore the events before the year zero and find out how the ship’s society changed to a traditional one with strict gender roles.  However, due to story reasons, you are limited on how many files you can read per day.  After reading around a third of the files, you are forced to wait 12 hours before continuing.  This can be cheated by adjusting the system clock, but it is something to be forewarned about.  My biggest issue with this game is the slow scroll speed in the logs.  Since the game has to load your AI companion’s reactions, it limits how fast you can scroll.  Also, one of the achievements is not achievable in any way, so you’ll never have 100% completion.  Despite these issues, I still recommend this game.\n","November 1, 2015","true","9.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A lot more characters and NPCs are in play, so there's more stories to shift focus between and lots more drama to follow.\n\nThis is also kind of the downside. Analogue was pretty much the story of the Pale Bride. Hate Plus is Mute's story, but it's also the story of everyone that gets pulled into the spiral with her. It's great as backstory, and the story is still as engrossing as ever, but Analogue had a more compelling hook, I think.\n\nThis is more like a doomed outcome from the start, while Analogue keeps you guessing all the way.\n\nThese are just minor gripes, though.

I have felt the same in books (Recently redThe Last WereWolf by Glenn Duncan, and found the romance in it to be very captivating and heartwrenching), in films (Watched the Original Old Dog, and loved it), but games...not that much that I can remember.\nAnd yet, this game actually made me grit my teeth and strain my hands and just wish that this kind of pain and misery portrayed in the game didn't actually exist, and yet has and might always will. I have not played the original, but this game...well, I should do the summary.\nYou are a investigator for a company in the far off future, and explore a derlict space vessel that once held thousands of people from Korea. But when all are found dead under mysterious circumstances, you interrogate/investigate the AI's of the ship (Either the ships security Mute* or/and Hyun-ae) and find out what happened and why.\n\nOne keypoint in the game that I noticed early on is how the AI is protrayed as cartoon characters (an anime cute girl), but all the pictures are of very realistic people. This suggests a very clear design choice by not only the programmer of the game, but the programmers of the ship as well to create a world within the vessel. There are many suggestions that are like that which create a interesting but very strange and discomforting world of lies, politics, and failed romances.\nThis game does not try to sugarcoat anything from you, as it goes into the lifes of the occupants of the vessel who range from scientists who are trying to work for the betterment of their generation to a pop idol who falls in love with a poor girl. They all branch into other paths and such, but they all come down to one piece of data that is so visible and yet so mysterious that even the character's themselves comment on it.\nAnother thing that is incredibly refreshing is that the characters themselves comment on the data you read, and show disgust, anger, frustration, enjoyment, embarrasement, and all types of emotions that make them incredibly relatable.\nAnd one thing that makes it so fascinating is that the game actually progresses through three real days; you work one one huge batch of data, and then you are forced to rest for twelve hours before continuing. This creates a incredible plot point in the second day that is so gut punchingly awful to the senses that I actually struggled to not bash the next man's face in due to how it made me feel. But the third day...the third day made the pain smooth over, made me calm down as the AI expresses their own feelings about it as well, creating a rare moment when I actually really cared about what the game told me to do. And no, I bought a pound cake...but I was honest :I.\n\nDo I recommend this game: YES\nOne of the most impactful games I have played in quite some time, Hate Plus reminds us that visual novels are not just click-fests just to get to the endings, but real work that people put lots of effort into. The story the game tells, the images, the understanding of what not to tell over WHAT to tell is shown here, and I am so glad to have played it. Am I happy? No...It is truly a story about Hate. Is it a story that must be played? Oh yes.\n\nSUGGESTIONS(FOR GAME DEVS):\nPerhaps work on a sequel to this where the AI's continue on working with the player character? Just a thought. Even if this is the end, I still highly trust your judgement and writing abilities, and will wait for your next release.","January 4, 2014","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have felt the same in books (Recently redThe Last WereWolf by Glenn Duncan, and found the romance in it to be very captivating and heartwrenching), in films (Watched the Original Old Dog, and loved it), but games...not that much that I can remember.\nAnd yet, this game actually made me grit my teeth and strain my hands and just wish that this kind of pain and misery portrayed in the game didn't actually exist, and yet has and might always will. I have not played the original, but this game...well, I should do the summary.\nYou are a investigator for a company in the far off future, and explore a derlict space vessel that once held thousands of people from Korea. But when all are found dead under mysterious circumstances, you interrogate/investigate the AI's of the ship (Either the ships security Mute* or/and Hyun-ae) and find out what happened and why.\n\nOne keypoint in the game that I noticed early on is how the AI is protrayed as cartoon characters (an anime cute girl), but all the pictures are of very realistic people. This suggests a very clear design choice by not only the programmer of the game, but the programmers of the ship as well to create a world within the vessel. There are many suggestions that are like that which create a interesting but very strange and discomforting world of lies, politics, and failed romances.\nThis game does not try to sugarcoat anything from you, as it goes into the lifes of the occupants of the vessel who range from scientists who are trying to work for the betterment of their generation to a pop idol who falls in love with a poor girl. They all branch into other paths and such, but they all come down to one piece of data that is so visible and yet so mysterious that even the character's themselves comment on it.\nAnother thing that is incredibly refreshing is that the characters themselves comment on the data you read, and show disgust, anger, frustration, enjoyment, embarrasement, and all types of emotions that make them incredibly relatable.\nAnd one thing that makes it so fascinating is that the game actually progresses through three real days; you work one one huge batch of data, and then you are forced to rest for twelve hours before continuing. This creates a incredible plot point in the second day that is so gut punchingly awful to the senses that I actually struggled to not bash the next man's face in due to how it made me feel. But the third day...the third day made the pain smooth over, made me calm down as the AI expresses their own feelings about it as well, creating a rare moment when I actually really cared about what the game told me to do. And no, I bought a pound cake...but I was honest :I.\n\nDo I recommend this game: YES\nOne of the most impactful games I have played in quite some time, Hate Plus reminds us that visual novels are not just click-fests just to get to the endings, but real work that people put lots of effort into. The story the game tells, the images, the understanding of what not to tell over WHAT to tell is shown here, and I am so glad to have played it. Am I happy? No...It is truly a story about Hate. Is it a story that must be played? Oh yes.\n\nSUGGESTIONS(FOR GAME DEVS):\nPerhaps work on a sequel to this where the AI's continue on working with the player character? Just a thought. Even if this is the end, I still highly trust your judgement and writing abilities, and will wait for your next release.","January 4, 2014","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

To provide some backstory, it is recommended that Analogue: a Hate Story should be played first, though since Mute isn't exactly fleshed out a whole lot in that game, one can probably get away with playing this first.\n- Art style is fairly generic, though the sepia-photo visuals do provide some fresh realism and believability to the story.\nThe enhanced HUD from the next game is pretty nice, though some people have reported issues with it bugging out and failing to display anything. Windowed mode fixes that from memory.\n- Good soundtrack that meshes well with the material that it supports.\n- Great character development: this ties in with the story, but it's refreshing to see characters who aren't just "I'm tsundere, but really I'm actually really nice, my mum and dad died in a car crash when I was young", or "overly-exuberant moe-blob mk.2000". Both main supporting characters (or protagonists?) are very well developed, and allow NG+ playthroughs.\n\nCons:\n- Game design. The options available to you are so limited compared to the first game. Literally the entirety of the game revolves around decrypting logs, reading through them, and getting your supporting character to interact with them. You get options from a dialogue wheel to choose from, but there's none of the puzzle-solving that was available from the first game.\nThis flaw was probably the biggest disappointment I had with this game, and what really stopped me from doing a NG+ playthrough.\n\nAll in all, a great game especially in the story and visual department. The game mechanics are very bare-bones, though if you haven't played the first game and are familiar with the usual "choose this option" type of VN, you shouldn't find this a problem.\n","January 9, 2015","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The setting now takes place on your spaceship on it's way back to Earth along with whomever you brought along from the Mugunghwa: either *Hyun-ae or *Mute (or both) and you are stuck with them for the next 3 days. The entries you will be reading will take place before the events in Analogue so your save files from Analogue can be transfered over to Hate Plus if you choose to do so. Although the story feels a bit weaker than Analogue, it's still a good story nonetheless and it's themes shift from traditional society into a more democratic society with political instability, including once again sexual themes with some LGBT thrown into the mix. Unfortunately, this is pretty much a linear novel despite having choices, but sadly it is only an illusion and so the only thing that changes is the dialogue so you can be a complete jerk and their opinion of you will remain the same. Scrolling down log files have been fairly annoying due to the fact that it does pause a couple of times for unexplained reasons and with the AI's commentating while you read can be a bit more bad than good because you can accidentally miss a bit of dialogue and there is no way to go back and read what you missed, but as long as you pay attention, it will only be a minor complaint. Once you run out of power for the day and finish reading all of the entries you downloaded, you will have to wait for 12 hours in order to get back into reading again and it can be a bit irritating if you really want to keep reading, but it can be beneficial if you want to take a break, but can't find a good place to stop (there is a way to bypass the 12 hour wait time, but personally I never did that). Overall, I think this is a nice expansion to an already great novel the industry has to offer us, but again I highly recommend that you check out Analogue before jumping into Hate Plus.","July 30, 2014","true","14.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Loved that the saves were carried, on the fact that we had logs. Wait I kind of disliked was the wait time, the whole matter of mute not being able to change, and currently questioning how to get that four materia one. Either way this game promises a nice addition if you have played analogue. In this game you are put to a different interactive sense which applies to a notable level both nice and annoying. Scrolling through logs and logs seeing feedback can be quick interesting but I warn you skip too fast on scrolling you might miss a great reaction from either one of the AIs. I was satisfied as I played through the routes, read up in interest, and the fact that you learn a bit more. However what I do wish there will be maybe another installment like this. If not continued works from the creators who amde this as it was worth taking the time to play and take part in. However I know a lot are stressing over the achievement hording. What I just hope is that we get the chance to have more clothes for the character. Either way my rating of the game would be a 7.5-9. In general it reached my expectations and past some in dialogue but left out. On average it would be an 8.8-8.9. In it's own right, it attracted me to play it more than once and save like crazy. I know you can roll back for route but that's limited. Either way, great game, good story, and hope for more.","February 24, 2014","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I strongly recommend playing that first as the events in this game would not make much sense otherwise.\n\nMuch like its predecessor, Hate Plus has you reading through logs to find out what happened in the past.  If you liked Analogue, you’ll like this.  This time you explore the events before the year zero and find out how the ship’s society changed to a traditional one with strict gender roles.  However, due to story reasons, you are limited on how many files you can read per day.  After reading around a third of the files, you are forced to wait 12 hours before continuing.  This can be cheated by adjusting the system clock, but it is something to be forewarned about.  My biggest issue with this game is the slow scroll speed in the logs.  Since the game has to load your AI companion’s reactions, it limits how fast you can scroll.  Also, one of the achievements is not achievable in any way, so you’ll never have 100% completion.  Despite these issues, I still recommend this game.\n","November 1, 2015","true","9.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's the equivalent of "required reading" for VNs, and maybe even for all video games at all. Get all three endings in Analogue before playing this, do the Harem route first, then the other ones. ♥♥♥♥ the characters who caused all this, I wrote a huge rant about them, but ♥♥♥♥ it I'm not writing it again from scratch.\nHave fun, and enjoy the emotional rollercoaster.","November 20, 2015","true","18.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Just as before, you need to play two endings in order to get all of the story pieces, which is tedious in a kinetic story.\n\nA new "feature" of this game is that it limits you to a certain amount of content per real-world day. I would much rather choose the amount that I want to play in a day based on my real-world schedule and my mood. This was not optional and it ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off.\n\nI also had issues with the interface. The story panels did not respond to my scroll wheel or arrow keys so I had to manually slide the scroll bar with my track pad. This may seem like a minor complaint but there is a lot of scrolling involved and it was irritating.","March 20","false","11.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's shorter than the first game but features multiple routes and some intriguing gameplay choices.

Unlike in the first game, the developer threw a lot of rules out the window, and the game was better for it.\n\nPros: Beautiful storytelling, multiple choices that lead to multiple endings, very novel 4th wall bending design choices\n\nCons: Really does require a previous playthrough of the previous game in the series to fully enjoy. The game makes a lot of references that would go over newcomer's heads. There's also another ending which is impossible to get without the previous game as well.\n\nBeautiful!","January 15","true","12.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It picks up after the original "Analogue: A Hate Story" via some quick multiple-choice about the way you ended the previous game - however you don't need to have played the previous game to appreciate it, in fact that would probably work better from the mystery angle. There are two possible companions, *Mute who is extremely traditional and *Hyun-Ae who is more flexible and open; both serve just to comment on the text that you read and very occasionally ask questions for a bit of branching narrative. Most of the gameplay is picking which email to read next and then reading through it so that you can work out what actually happened in the central catastrophe which is the main subject of the game.\n\nThe game limits how many emails you can "extract" at once, and once you've reached a certain number it'll declare the day over (this kind of makes sense in-game), encouraging you to literally wait until the next day until playing further. It's conspicuously designed to be immersive, and the wait is an element of that. Each "day" takes probably about 1 to 1.5 hours to run through, so it has an extremely casual pace, and the game takes place across three "days".\n\nThe content includes convoluted politics, a surprising amount of homosexuality, and some mildly explicit content. The secondary characters - the authors of the emails - are pretty interesting, and the pictures make them fairly easy to remember.\n\nYou might reasonably assume that there are romance plots with the companion characters; that's true but they are optional and not very extensive.\n\nSo, it's a somewhat immersive mystery experience. Good if you like mysteries, not so good if you like a lot of interactivity.","January 8","true","10.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lyonesse/recommended/239700/","Lyonesse","Lyonesse","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lyonesse/","202 products in account","This game is a sequel to "Analogue: A Hate Story" and for a better experience, I really recommend you to not play it before playin' it's prequel.\n\nThe "Hate Project" (Analogue + Hate Plus) is pretty different from the usual visual novel formula. It isn't focused in dating or romance, but it consists in a needed and mature cross-cultural reflection with elements of feminism all over the main plotline. It does a perfect criticism of the patriarchal system, which is a needed reflection since a lot of it's traces remain in our modern society - and we should eliminate them as soon as possible.\n\nYou will play as a space explorer who was hired to investigate the wreckage of a long lost space ship whose disappearance has been a mystery for ages. The ship is inhabited, it's crew is long dead. The only remnants of life are two AI programs called Hyun-ae and Mute. Together, you will dig through the archives, records and digital letters from old members of the crew trying to piece together where and why everything went wrong.\n\nHate Plus is another heartwarming and unique Visual Novel experience, as Analogue. If you're a fan of Visual Novels with deep plotlines, I definitely recommend you to give this dramatic masterpiece a try.\n\nWARNING: Avoid this game if you don't like heavy reading, because this game is all about reading (and re-reading) tons of texts and try to put small pieces of plot together. Also, if you are an achievement hunter this game might be trouble for you, since it has one impossible to get achievement.","April 20","true","18.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"Level Four Revive Materia"\n\nThat aside, this game is the second game, and should be played after Analogue: A hate story.\n\nIt's a simple point and click visual novel, with a bit of a twist, the game expects you to wait a significant amount of real life hours before you can complete the game. If you're impatient, you're going to hate this game. (You can change your computer's date and time though, which will work, if you're that desperate.)\n\n10/10 - The animator for this game, and character designs are beautifully done. I can't complain, Mute, Hyun-ai (both my waifu's in the past game waaaat.) are wonderfully designed. The actual in game character art is really beautiful too, and I still really like the color switch depending on what AI you're using.\n\nMy only gripe with this game is up above, and afaik, there is -no- way to get the achievement. The story is really well done too, and I enjoyed playing through the game. Baking cake is however, not good for my thighs so thanks for that, Ms. Love. Lol... And yes, they do blackmail you for real cake. haha.\n\nI'd recommend the game, it's well worth the price, and honestly, there's a LOT of content, so if you're patient - give this game, and Analogue: A Hate Story a shot","June 4","true","11.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
