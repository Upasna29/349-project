Various updates over the 2013 edition, including a 3D (kind of?) Game Day which is a joy to watch compared to the 2D sprites we're used to. Pick your favourite NRL or SL team and take them to victory. Or even pick a lower tier team just for fun, such as a US team and build them into a force.\n\nUpon tinkering with the game a bit more, I highly recommend you read the Starters Guide from the launch menu. It will help you tremendously. I also recommend you take your time to learn the game properly; it's very daunting at first but when you sink a couple of hours into it and fully learn the mechanics, it is very rewarding.\n\nThe only downside I can see is there are a fair few teams/championships lacking proper logos which were included in the 2013 Edition. Hopefully these can be sorted out in the future, I may have to play around with the Player Editor (also a great feature) and see if I can fix some names and player stats manually. The game is also very pricey which may deter a few people.\n\nBut I've sunk 50+ hours into the 2013 edition and with modern rosters I can't wait to sink 500+ into this one. This game isn't for anyone, but if you're a Rugby League enthusiast who wants a Sim game akin to Football Manager, this is just for you.","June 19, 2015","true","27.5"," 23 of 27 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","23","27","2","0"

It isn't perfect but this is a huge day for the sport as we finally have a management game to be proud of. If you are willing to learn the nuances of what you can do here, this title is as in depth as any you might come across in any other sport. It isn't perfect and will need to evolve over time, but this is the first game in a new franchise and is a fantastic effort. I was fortunate enough to have early access and I am addicted.\n\nYou can take a tiny club up and down the divisions (my spell in charge of my local team Blackbrook resulted in relegation before immediate redemption the season later) and the level of detail you can work on is huge. Stadia, academies, training facilities, gyms and so on. Each one will chip away at making your team better and making more available to you.\n\nThe 3D match engine is surprisingly impressive and you can see the calls and tactics you come up with being put into practice, which is a really good feeling when you have success. You can have team calls that work with your preferred style of play. You can concentrate on attack like Leigh or you can concentrate on the gritty, rough defence like a Shaun Wane "inspired" WIgan.\n\nThere is so much detail to go through that you can have different experiences in different leagues. Different tactics prosper in the lower levels when you have less tactical nous at your disposal. The NRL has a higher standard of player and will not hesitate to punish you or your team for making errors or not being fit enough.\n\nI can't praise this enough - it isn't as vast as Football Manager and anyone expecting it to be so is being unrealistic. The difference in budget is massively pronounced. But it is absolutely the king of Rugby League management games, and it is a crown that I have been waiting for a title to take for a very long time.\n\nWell,well worth a buy if you love rugby league.","June 19, 2015","true","47.6"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","89","17","19","5","0"

It's getting there though and I thank you for the effort!\n\nCons\n-Interface is unappealing and a chore to navigate.\n-Hard for a new player to get a handle on what they are doing.\n-Ratings are way off on some players(Adam Reynolds who is South Sydney's number 1 goal kicker and premiership winning halfback is average, when someone like Alex Johnston is instantly World Class on the back of one good season? 2 players in the Souths squad yet to make their first grade debut have more value than Adam Reynolds? If I start a game I may as well sign a new halfback to replace the one I have who is one of the best in the game in real life!)\n-Some players are missing entirely. I understand someone like Kirisome Auva'a being suspended for almost the entire 2015 season might have been hard to simulate in-game but you'd have been better off having him unrealistically available from the start than not to have him in at all.\n\nPros\n-It's a Rugby League Management game.\n-The development team to time to actually make a freaking Rugby League management game and they came as close as they did to getting it right!\n-One of my initial concerns has been changed from a con into a pro and that is the Australian League system is set up unrealistically. Why is that now a good thing? From a gaming perspective, I have come to realise that I much prefer taking teams and battling for promotion and against relegation than like what a more realistic simulation of the Australian game would be. What would be the point of ever managing North Sydney in the NSW Cup(or any lower grade Australian team) if the NRL team I am the feeder club for keeps taking my good players and all I have to play for at the end of the day is the NSW Cup? With promotion and relegation added in, I can actually get North Sydney to the NRL and battle against the best teams in Australia for a competition trophy that actually means something! I now hope they never fix this! (or if they do, there's 2 modes of the game where you can play either a realistic simulation or the current setup).\n\nI understand that some of my examples of cons are rather specific but I've seen similar concerns that people have with their own favourite teams so I think they are valid points.\n\nSome things I'd suggest.\n\n-Tidy up the interface and just generally make it more user friendly for player of all skill levels.\n-Work on the ratings of players. If your development team is small, get some volunteers like FM do. If I had the tech knowhow I'd be more than willing to volunteer for rating for some players.\n-Have more happen at the start of the game to draw a player in. I remember playing International Cricket Captain and you'd go through budget phases and signing players to contracts and setting up training for the next few weeks and so on.\n\n\nAs things are, it's a thumbs down but if you're undecided and reading my review and you can get it really cheap, you love Rugby League and don't mind tinkering with some ratings at the start, it'd be a thumbs up.\n\nEdit: I notice someone marked my review as 'unhelpful' How in the hell was my review unfair? I wasn't needlessly critical, I tried to be constructive with my review and gave suggestions as to what I thought could improve and you'll notice that despite giving it a thumbs down I thank the developers for their efforts and even advise undecided people that this game might currently be a thumbs down from me but it might not necessarily be for you!\n\nYou're a jerk random thumbs down person!\n\nEdit:-I notice 3 people now have given a thumbs down to my review.\n\nIs it because It says 3.5 hours played? Ever thought that because of crappy internet connections in regional Australia that maybe I play steam games offline? Especially ones that don't have any need to be online like this game.","December 28, 2015","false","3.8"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","13","16","2","0"

Team selection needs to be made a smoother process (changing positions around can be a touch tedious). Also contract/transfer negotiations are too simple and easy.\n\nOverall a very enjoyable game that's essential for any Rugby League / management sim fan.

The game is not hugely removed from RLM2013, save for a 3D match engine, some "feats" (special once a match boosts awarded to your team when your player skill counts are better than your opponents) and up to date data base incorporating the new "Super 8" "Middle 8's" and "Lower 8's" league play off structure.\n\nOverall I enjoy playing this game. It is the only decent RL managment sim and if you like RL I would recommend you bought it. Don't worry about "value" - a fairer price in my view would be about £20, but I will happily pay a tenner to the top man who has invested time in making an RL game (Union seems to rule, and I am really not interested in club Union).\n\nFor constructive feedback,  I do think it could be improved with a little more polish. Team names could include background and font colours in tandem with team colours (rarher than just black and white/grey), team logos are not present for international and rep games (if offical RFL/NRL backing held, why on earth not?). These are easy and cheap wins I think.  Better presentation on the 3D engine would be helpful too - though FIFA Football quality is obviously not expected would be good to see something at least as good as FM2014. There's also too many dodgy named Albanians and Nigerians etc created (I know RL has some global reach but never seen an Albanian RL and my London Broncos team now has an international calibre Albanian..really?!\n\nStill a worthy game and worth it if you like RL.","July 8, 2015","true","199.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

RL is quite a small sport, certainly when compared to football, but given the success of Football Manager over the years it always puzzled me that fans of rugby league didn't have the opportunity to enjoy a cerebral, strategic management game given the tactical nature of the sport.\n\nWell, now we do.\n\nThere's a 3D match engine, which you can change to a 2D top-down style if that's your preference, and you can see the plays and tactics you selected being carried out by your players. How your team plays is totally up to you - recruit speedy backs and play a wide, expansive game or construct a juggernaut of a pack to rumble over the opposition. In defence it's entirely your choice as to whether your boys concentrate on conserving their own energy and just make the tackles, or whether it's a case of grinding the opposition players down with bone-crunching 3-man tackles.\n\nThe level of detail is absolutely staggering; there are real people I know playing for tiny amateur clubs who are in the game's database. The research that has gone into this title is truly impressive and I don't doubt that many an amateur player will buy this game and be surprised to find himself in there.\n\nI look forward to this game turning into a successful series and really growing its fanbase.

A mistake.\n\n\nThe game feels like an abstraction of Rugby League, rather than remotely realistic.  The matches don't play out realistically as the match clock ticks over at a speed which means each team only get a handful of sets of six each half, hugely impacting on the scores etc.  A big mistake and one which should not have been made.  A much better idea is to adopt the Football Manager style of highlights or actually watch a complete match with action accelerated at accelerated time, so everything would play out better.\n\nThe playcall system where you can boost defence etc temporarily plays out like a weird card game during a match - again, bizarre and not realistic.\n\nI could list more but I won't. It's not fair to compare to the behemoth that is Football Manager, but compared to deep (yet relatively low budget) management games like OOTP Baseball and Front Office Football, this seems like a lame duck.  And more expensive too.  I don't like bashing games and devs, but I have to say something here.  £10 might be a fair price for this for some.\n\nGame uninstalled after 2-3 hrs play.\n\nSo imagine my excitement when I see that Steam offer refunds (amazingly I'd never realised before).  And imagine my disappointment when Steam tell me my application for a refund is rejected on the grounds that I bought it too long ago.\n\nSo £30 for 2-3hrs of "experience".

The navigation around screens is difficult, requiring a player to enter and exit multiple screens to do simple things - instead of simply selecting a player and being given menus to deal with them (for example, contracts, physio, doctor, etc.) one has to navigate to different pages for each action one wants to take.  This at present is the largest failing of the game in my opinion, and one which I hope is worked on significantly in future.\n\n2. There are inaccuracies in the game which could be easily rectified with some simple research - for example the number of representative games is not reflected by real life (although I do enjoy being able to coach Yorkshire in the War of the Roses series), whilst some players cannnot be picked for the correct representative teams (The Burgess brothers, all Yorkshire born and bred, are only eligible for Lancashire in my game) - Whilst this can be fixed with the editor, I feel it should not fall on the player to input simple correct information into the system.\n\n3. The game, whilst fun, is still one in it's infancy in terms of features and depth - whilst this would not normally be a criticism, it is the main reason I am not giving the game a recommend - the full £30 price tag is not justified by a game lacking in depth as this does. A more reasonable £10-15 would have changed this from a no-recommend to a recommend.\n\nExamples of the lack of depth include player contracts/transfers, the relationship between player and manager (the "morale" system simply seems to be a case of giving players down on morale some game time), game mechanics that allow for a little more in-game strategy and tactics (perhaps creating ones own attacking moves?).\n\nSo, tl;dr:\n\n1. Interface is clunky and hard to manage, and downright offensive to look at if playing with certain teams.\n2. Many mistakes in the database.\n3. Game is not deep enough in content to justify the price tag.\n\n\nIf you are a hardcore Rugby League fan with £30 to spare then it may be worth getting the game to sate your desire for an RL management game, furthermore I do hope that the developers go on to produce further, more polished versions of the game.  This game is not a bad effort, and I honestly wish I was given options other than simply "Yes" or "No" on the recommend front (a "Depends" would be nice).","December 5, 2015","false","12.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The NRL and Australia leagues have been a bit poorly implemented. Also, some of it is rather confusing. Particularly the training etc... I was getting breached for not enough players being promoted and it took forever to work out how to actually fix this.\n\nBy far the worse bit has to be the presentation. I find it awkward and ugly.\n\nHowever, there's definitely some good things within it. I think the games themselves work well and definitely a good base.\n\nHopefully, the developer takes some feedback and works to improve the game itself. I'm happy to support it, but there's still a bit of work to go.","December 26, 2015","true","7.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I played the 2013 version of this game and there is definitely a huge improvement.\n\nGood points:\n- Ability to change between 2D and 3D match views.\n- Realistic Super League Squads (Updated 2016)\n- More Realism\n- Includes the Magic Weekend fixtures & World Club Series Matches (St James' Park, Newcastle. Although not sure whether the 2013 game included this or not)\n\nBad Points:\n- The menu systems can be hard to navigate for new users, however a rough tutorial is supplied.\n- I experience a bug at the end of matches, meaning I have to re-launch the game, and re-play the match.\n\nAs a Rugby League Fan, the game is fantastic and enjoyable. There are a few little things that could be improved, but it's nothing big. I recommend any rugby league fan, NRL or Super League to buy this game.\n\n","May 22","true","13.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
