Most games- if you play them long enough- get boring and tiresome. The people I play with weekly and most of the time daily, have played totals of thousands of hours and yet continue to play weekly/daily. This is because there really can't ever be a round in ND thats the same as another. Each team won't ever be exactly the same, the commanders won't usually be the same, and how the players play in each map will always be different so that you really aren't just going through the motions after hours and hours of gameplay. I know that myself and at least 100-150 other dedicated core players feel the same way. The other reviews of this game that I see are from people who really havent played it all that much and have just taken their first look FPS and RTS aspects. A lot of what they say is correct.. There are definitely areas of ND that need work, and since theres no real developer working on it not much can change.\n\nHowever, even though there is no actual developer, ND is constantly being improved and tweaked to make gameplay better. This is because of server managers and testers in the community itself who have fixed glitches, improved team balancing, made mods, and have organized ND soooooo much in the past 2 years. Nuclear Dawn was on a downswing and playercounts were at an all time low, but now that there are scheduled events, groups, and stats, things are getting better fast!\n\nSo to people who say Nuclear Dawn is dying: It WAS dying, now its only getting better little by little. I highly recommend this game and encourage people to give it a fair chance. Join the group "ND Battles" for scheduled formal and casual events. I truly love this game and will never stop playing it!","August 19, 2014","true","022.2"," 183 of 193 people (95%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","95","183","193","3","7"

It's an amazing concept, and it works really well. It has all of the aspects of the best FPS games, like requiring a balance of different classes (not everyone can run and gun) and communication to win. Matches can completely change over just a few minutes. It's got incredible potential if they make another and perhaps polish it, but I would definitely support this game. Not very expensive for a lot of potential play time.","November 2, 2014","true","37.1"," 85 of 90 people (94%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","94","85","90","3","0"

I suited up in my Consortium regulation support medic armor and headed out from base. Word had come down from the brass that morning that some filthy Empire scum had set up camp in the north end of the ruins, and were trying to take control of several key resource deposits. Another beautiful day in the Consortium!\n\nFor maybe 30 seconds, everybody wildly fired at each other to practice their aim. Like clockwork, before every battle, we fought each other. A couple died in the melee, only to return to the class selection menu. They were good men. They were good soldiers.\n\nWe set out from base towards the primary objective immediately. As we approached the dilapidated building, a monument to Golden Age human engineering, it was quiet. I watched our six - just so I could sneak some hypospray for myself before the storm. There's nothing quite like a hit of high quality government issue painkillers right before a gunfight, all on the Consortium's dollar.\n\nAs we rounded the last corner out into the courtyard where our target lay, I saw an all too familiar sight. A swarm of rockets whizzed down the hallway. Fortunately, my nano skin hadn't worn off yet and I was preserved from the rocket blast. My squad, however, was none so lucky, buried underneath a pile of rubble. And then I heard them - the Empire knew of our attack, and had set an embush! Surly Russian voices cried out what I had come to understand as "attack!", and I set off running back the way I came. I took another hypospray just to be ready for anything.\n\nI ran back outside, and took a full shotgun blast to the face from a crafty assault trooper who managed to get behind me! Broken and battered, I lifted my machine gun and let out a blast at his head and killed him. Okay, okay, I know it's unbelievable, but that nanoskin is good stuff for guys like us. As I scanned the perimeter, I saw them - the rocket trails of Consortium exo troopers laying siege at the far end of the primary structure. Wounded, I ran along the walls of the buildings in the street until I could rendezvous with the big guns.\n\nBack behind my own lines, I threw a medkit on the floor which somehow managed to heal all our wounds just by laying there.\n\nIt was a good day.","December 28, 2014","true","192.7"," 131 of 160 people (82%) found this review helpful 112 people found this review funny","82","131","160","112","2"

So bear that in mind.\n\nSo what's Nuclear Dawn? It is a representative of a very rare breed of video games, which combine classic FPS action as a foot soldier and Top Down RTS style commander role. Two teams fight for dominance over critical locations on the map with commanders providing support in form of abilities and buildings which allow forward psawning of reinforcements, ammo/hp regen and defences.\n\nThe game itself is fast paced, with several classes to choose from: classic Assault with powerful weaponry, able to take a few hits before going down and iconic thermal vision which negates invisibility, EXO with tons of health and deadly weapons, most effective against buildings, Stealth for general sneaking about, either with knives which can backstab unsuspecing players to sniper and unique sabateur with remote bombs, and lastly a trusty support with lightning-fast firing SMGs, shotgun or a freaking flame thrower. Everyone will find something fun to choose from.\n\nUnofrtunately the game does not have a massive following but there is a good server or two, one in US one in Germany to choose from.\n\nAs always remember: there is no middle ground when it comes to FPSRTS matches. You either get a complete stomp of a match, which thankfully does not last too long or you get a very fun and amazing experience, which will keep you coming back for more, day after day.","November 3, 2014","true","36.3"," 68 of 72 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","68","72","2","0"

The way how the is balanced, how it requires a good team cooperation to win, how nicely it blends FPS and RTS... everything is just perfect.\n\nHowever. I've stopped playing it, because of the toxic community. Everyone knows better all the time. Let me give you a few examples:\n\nYou want to start a new server? Nah, dont bother - a bunch of minions will go there, starts ruining the matches, spamming the chat ("YOU SHOULD GO TO THE OTHER SERVER IT IS MUCH BETTER"), crashing it by using exploits, shaming it in a discussion forums, how can they do much better... you name it.\n\nYou reach the developer (which otherwise doesnt exist anymore) and help with releasing a patch fixing a critical issues? Nah, dont bother - they already know these issues before, and have the (crippling) patches for themselves for a long time already, so "this is not a contribution whatsover". Hello? Releasing an official patch fixing gameplay? Well, whatever.\n\nYou release a few plugins for fixing some other issues? Nah, your code is ♥♥♥♥, and they know better. If you'll let them improve the code, they'll break it, so it stop working... which proves their point, that your code is ♥♥♥♥. So... dont bother.\n\n\nNow, if you'll read the other reviews, you'll read a lot of "the community is dead". If you want to know the real reason why it is, it's because the community is toxic af. I spoke to a dozen of people who played 1000+ hours of this game, and the reason why they left is always the same.\n\nSo I'll just leave it here.","November 25, 2013","true","327.3"," 126 of 158 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","126","158","2","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/End-The-Fed/recommended/17710/","End-The-Fed","End-The-Fed [cha0s]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/End-The-Fed/","57 products in account","I purchased this game on a fluke and it ended up my favorite game of all time. I've been playing Nuclear Dawn since the beginning. The game had a surge in popularity, the participation died off dramatically, and saw another surge in popularity again. This is bacause there is no actual game developer, and the Nuclear Dawn community has taken the task of fixing in-game glitches, improved balancing experienced and new players at map startup, created mods, and create gaming events that have brought all the core fans back to the fore.\n\n\n\nNuclear Dawn is a fast-paced Real Time Strategy (RTS) and a First Person Shooter (FPS) game combined in one. One person elects to be the "Commander", enters the team HQ and the view becomes an RTS, for all other players its an FPS. Other temmates are respinsible for capturing tertiary points that bring in income to the Commander to build supply stations, ammunition, turrets and new spawn points.\n\n\n\nThe main challenges for the Commander are: power management, strategic placement of forward structures, and resource management.\n\n\n\nThe main challenge for the other teammates are: capturing tertiary poins, maintining control of those tertiary points and defending the forward structures and power grid the commander builds up. This is accomplished by the teammates evenly dividing themselves into one of four soldier classes: Stealth, Assault, Exo, and Support. All classes have critical strengths and one achilles heel against one type of class. For example: Charge in with all heavy eight Exo gunners, three cloaked Stealth scouts can kill them all with one stab in the back. So a balanced team with all four classes is crucial for success.\n\n\n\nOn that last point is the game's greatest triumph and greatest failure. Your quality gaming experience depends on how well your team cooperates with the commander and with each other. If a commander has a disorganized team, the team refuses to take orders from the commander, or simply the entire team goes ranged scouts with sniper rifles (has happened to me several times)...the game is doomed for that team, and makes for an emotionally intense, grueling, and demoralizing 20-45 minutes of "turtle-ing" at the base accompanied with teammates pointing fingers of blame, general freaking out and some verbal abuse. But...if the team is quick to respond to the commander's requests, has an even distribution of class types, whether win or loose, it makes for the most memorable, magical, endorphin-rush-to-the-brain-gaming experiences you could experience. That is what keeps players returning to this game. That is also why fans of this game are so incredibly loyal.\n\n\n\nThat being said...the less desirable, grueling gaming experiences have driven off many players. When I used to play hardcore 4 hours a day there were anywhere from 10 to 15 servers active with 12-35 players on at any given time around the world. Today there are only two servers with 3-10 active players plus bots at on high traffic hours of the day. The only times there are high numbers are when ND parties are organized and that usually happens twice a month.\n\n\n\nRequirements for pleasant gameplay:\n1. GET A MICROPHONE!!!! - Nobody can play in a fast paced environment without team chat. Teammates or the Commander may request favors, give orders, ask for tactical support, or may need status updates...typing responses is out of the question. Typing is so laborious that all non-microphone players eventually stop typing all together, killing the tactial advantage of communication within the team.\n2. COOPERATE WITH TEAMMATES AND THE COMMANDER - This is not a one person game. It's solely dependent on how well the team can act as a unit.\n3. EVENLY DIVIDE THE CLASSES YOU PICK - Your about to respawn and there's no medic on your team? Man up, stop being a Scout with a sniper rifle missing all your head shots and support the heavy Exos.\n4. LEARN HOW TO BE AN EFFECTIVE COMMANDER - This can only be learned with experience and my video tutorials at:\n\n\nwww.YouTube.com/NuclearDawnHelp\n\nNote these tutorials are very old, but the core strategies remain effective. Do I recommend this game? Absolutely. Would you be playing this game often with other users? At the current rate of participation, unless you have a few friends that don't mind giving ND a shot with you, probably not.","November 29, 2015","true","508.5"," 75 of 86 people (87%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","87","75","86","5","0"

I never had so much fun dying before.  But it lacks in certain elements this offline play isn't that much fun because the AI for the bots is horrible bots get stuck don't listen to commands that well.  But the offline play is good to get a better feel of the Commander Position.  So the breakdown of the game is one of the players gets designated commander.  The commander is the most important position he is in charge of the the RTS side of the game building structures and telling the FPS players where to go.  A great commander will make or break the game.  The online play is FANTASIC. I would of loved to see this game in its heyday because not a lot of people are playing online but it is still so much fun. You can normally find one server with a few people online.  The downside is they have been playing for awhile and its hard to level up your character.  But keep at it and you will get there I almost have my EXO (heavy weapons/heavy armor) to level 10 to get an upgrade.  There are four classes of soldiers, Assault, EXO, Support, and Stealth.  Each class has its unique abilities for the game stealth you can cloak and back-stab for the kill or become a sniper.  Assault just like the name says but you also get the thermal vision so you can see the stealth soldiers cloaked.  The EXO is great for starting out a character in my opinion because of the heavy armor.  Support is paramount to any good game with abilities to fix structures heal players, and resupply them.  This game is well worth it $9.99 price tag and is sure to provide you with plenty of hours of fun.","February 13, 2014","true","28.2"," 58 of 69 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","58","69","0","3"

What a great decision!\nIt turns out this is an amazing and well designed co-op game, it is definitely not what one would expect from a 2€ game, it is rather a 20€ game.\n\nThe gameplay provides a lot of room for in-depth teamwork with a variety of classes and weapon kits, all suited for different situations, and it is decently balanced. Playing this with friends and good communicating commanders on both teams gives quite an intense outcome. You will be fighting for key positions and pushing back of waves of enemies with commander support, you will get behind enemy lines and assasinate their commander or sabotage their power-grid so your fellow players can rush their positions, you will be going after resource points with your squad to ensure your commander gets resources, ...\nEach match is different and highly dynamic, depending on what strategy the commanders and soldiers choose. Playing on the same map is never the same thing!\n\nWhich brings me to another point: maps. I can't stop getting surprised at how well the maps are designed in this game. They are full of detail, full of alternative paths, full of hidden places you can use to get an advantage, and the atmosphere is just awesome.\n\nThe only problem of this game is its small player base. Most of the time there are one or two full servers of 32 players each, and steamgraph says there are 100 players at peak times/evenings.\n\nIf you like the idea of fps/rts hybrid games then you should definitely check this out! It goes on sale very often, and even for 9€ the price is still a joke considering what you get. If you watch the store videos and you think it could be cool, don't hesitate! The game is so much better than it appears in those videos!\nIt is a shame that this game does not get more attention. Only you can change that! Grab your friends and get Nuclear Dawn!

I played 2 hours that night in single player... I made the mistake the next day of playing multiplayer. 11 hours later I looked up to see that It was almost 10 PM and I'd lost my entire day... There is up to around 3 servers with a respectable amount of people at any given time, so it's not hugely popular, but the sale is bringing in more and more people.\n\nABOUT THE GAME\n\nDifficulty- It's fairly confusing if you're new to real time strategies to play as the commander, but the tutorials are very helpful. As a troop it's fairly easy to pick up as it's basically counter strike or a newer call of duty game. Technically this fits in the category I guess- the bots are beyond stupid. Half of them just try to jump up to unreachable places until they are shot. This, however, is hilarious.\n\nVariation- The classes are amazing. You can't switch weapons like in call of duty, you use whatever ones come with your class. While some find this annoying, I think it levels out the game and makes it better. There are currently four types of troops with up to three or four classes for each. Changing even just a class can change how you play, or if your team wins or not. And if you get bored of just shooting people, apply to be the commander and play it like a tower defence.\n\nLevel of fun- OOOVVEEEERRRRR 9000!!!!!!!!! (sorry not sorry ;D)\n\nSome other pros- There are people who use voice chat to be tactical, and awesome and stuff. I have so far only found one annoying person. The weapons as I said are balanced well. Most servers don't allow friendly fire, but it is an option.\n\nOverall this is an amazing game. How I've been describing it is as a super tactical version of counter strike (YOU CAN BE A FRIKKIN INVISIBLE NINJA) but that doesn't do it justice. Nuclear Dawn is so far my favorite FPS (I like being a drone not the leader personally). It's not just I shot Bob, Bob grenaded me, I knifed George, Jeff shot me... You can be a sneaky ninja, you can be an engineer and repair the buildings, you can flame thrower the crap out of people, you can snipe; you can use a rocket launcher, or a pistol; you can just be a soldier or you can lead an army.\n\n10/10 Wasted my whole day and many more to come.\n\nP.S.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/liquidid/recommended/17710/","liquidid","Liquid ID","http://steamcommunity.com/id/liquidid/","131 products in account","Nuclear Dawn has some novel ideas and some solid gameplay, but lacks balance and longevity.\nI like the idea behind the game... one commander building structures and trying to direct the flow of chaos from within a fortified bunker.  I don't like RTS's because I don't like splitting my attention between resources, structures, and every single unit out there.  Nuclear Dawn puts direction of the troops in the hands of the troops themselves.  Beautiful!  With that out of the way, the RTS commander gameplay is actually nice.\n\nOn the field are the grunts of varying classes.  Classes I originally felt played off each other like rock paper scissors with their advantages and disadvantages.  As I played longer, I realized how lopsided things were.\nTo it's credit, Nuclear Dawn presents 4 general classes, with subclasses within them, allowing for some role overlap but retaining unique perks.  You end up with things like infantry marksmen, stealth sharpshooters, heavy weapons, fire support, mechanical engineers, medics, assassins, etc.  It works well.  Mostly.  Some particular subclasses, like the saboteur, aren't provided enough perks to make them useful.  Same goes for most engineers.\n\nWeapons are a mixed bag, and most of them don't feel robust and exciting.  Sniper rifles are extremely jittery, Assault rifle recoil is insane, and grenades are incredibly overpowered.  The big huge armored guys carrying structure destroying weapons are either a rocket launcher that feels like its shooting needles or a big huge square tube that fizzles out a thin beam of blue energy that reminds me of a bug zapper, not a devastator.  The stealth class armblades just whiff through the air even when hitting someone.. no gusto, no grit.  And pistols, my god the pistols.. everyone carries one and every single one is like a sniper rifle.. it seems a common skill to get a headshot from long range with it and it's pretty much an instant kill unless you're heavily armored.\n\nPeople move quickly.  Circle strafe fights are everywhere, and it all amounts to who can land a headshot first because without it, killing anyone takes forever.  I've played games where my stealth ninja class was chasing a huge lumbering Exo-armored enemy... and I had to run full speed just to keep pace with him.  What the hell is that??  Exo is supposed to be slow and vulnerable.  As assault you have a vision mode that reveals cloaked stealths, but even when you can see them a mile off coming straight at you, sidestepping is so fast that it's hard to draw a bead on him before he runs right up to you and stabs you to death.  It feels like a bad Monty Python and the Holy Grail moment.\n\nThe push-pull feel of games is good, but is heavily reliant on team-oriented players.  People who can work towards a goal.  People who can hold a line of defense, even if the kill count could be higher elsewhere.  Eventually the game will tip heavily in favor of one team or another.  From this point, it can take 15-20 minutes before the game actually ends, all while the losing side gets spawn-killed repeatedly.  This is stupid.  The designers smartly added a surrender option, but only the commander can issue it, and most either don't know or don't care because while their team is spawning and dying in droves, they are in their bunker watching it all fall apart, trying to get turret kills until finally the bunker is destroyed.\n\nNuclear Dawn can also use bots.  Either in a single-player-esque mode, or to fill out online servers.  Unfortunately they are stupid.  I mean stand in place doing nothing stupid.  I mean won't follow basic commander directions stupid.  I mean don't react to bullets stupid.  I mean 10 years ago Perfect Dark Zero stupid.\n\nServers are scattered and few.  Players all cluster on one server.  Due to the XP and levelling system, veterans will have an advantage over newcomers in quite a drastic way.  That makes getting into the game harder.  I think it's accurate to say this is a dying game in it's twilight years.  Devs have stopped working on it.\n\nThe graphics aren't bad, the ideas aren't bad, it kind of comes close to being good.  But it isn't.  It's a shame because with proper care, this could have introduced a seriously fresh way to play both FPS and RTS.  I really wanted to enjoy this more, but it simply can't deliver any sustainable enjoyment, only disappointment and frustration.\nDon't play this.  In a short while, the farmer will come out to shoot this lame horse.","December 22, 2014","false","11.5"," 86 of 127 people (68%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","68","86","127","9","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hammer_Man/recommended/17710/","Hammer_Man","DINGUS.Hammer_Man","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hammer_Man/","137 products in account","Nuclear Dawn is one of the best mash ups of FPS and RST currently available on Steam.  It is my impression that the only contender in thei genre on steam is Natural Selection 2, so i will do a little compare/contrast at the end of this.\n\nThe good:\n\n-Excelent RTS gameplay.  UI is basic, and at times a little clunky, but in general it gets the job done for both macro and micro management of building, upgrades, and resources.  The biggest problem is relying on your soldiers to defend your structures and get you resources.\n\n-Decent FPS class based combat.  Each class has thier strengths, and thier weaknesses.  Weapons are well balanced across classes and teams. Certian mechanics can be difficult if you are used to more FPS centric games, and getting used to having to rely on someone to get you better weapons and spawn points can be tough, but in gerneral the FPS gameplay is rewarding.\n\n-A Great community.  The people who play this game LOVE it.  They set up events on popular severs, help out new people, and are very communicative.\n\nThe bad:\n\n-Small base of players. Time has taken its toll on the number of active players.  At peak times there is often a server of 30 players or so, but other than that there are very few people playing.\n\n-Small selection of maps.  Although the community has done thier best to make a wider selection of maps, there are still a very limited amount compared to FPS centeric and RTS centeric games.\n\n***Natural Selection 2 vs. Nuclear Dawn***\n\nNatural Selection 2 has 2 radically different sides.  Although this creates some more variety, thier strengths are appearant at different points throughout a match, which makes the game much more difficult to balance.  At this point in time I would say that for balancing reasons alone Nuclear Dawn is the better game.\n\nNuclear Dawn has considerably larger maps than Natural Selection 2.  This allows for more strategy for each commander, expecially when compared to Natural Selection's closed corridors and small rooms.\n\nBoth games have equivilent FPS gameplay, with the exception that NS2 is only class based for one of the teams.  The other team can custimize thier loadouts (shotguns midgame, grenade launchers/flamethrowers late game, exo suits end game), but thier overall stats are the same.\n\nNuclear Dawn blows the pants off NS2 when it comes to RTS UI.  Because the 2 sides have very similar buildings, the developers were able to keep the key bindings for each side's buildings the same, so it is very easy to play as commander for either side.  This is not the case for NS2.\n\n\nOverall, if you like FPS, or RTS this game is worth a try.  Make sure to sign up with the community groups so you know when everyone else is playing.\n\nA final note:  This game, like many team based FPS, really requires a mic.  You can still be an effective team member if you don't (there are in-game voice commands), but I can assure you that at least once every game you will wish you had it to call out enemy locations accuratly, or request supplies in a very specivic spot.  For the RTS element a mic is a must.","September 10, 2014","true","625.5"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","20","23","0","0"

He can build stuff, e.g. walls to protect his comrades from bullets or turrets that support them on the battlefield.\n\nThe goal for both teams is to secure points of interest that generate resources for the team and ultimately lead to the destruction of the enemy base.\n\nI could go on and on, but I know that nobody will ever read this, so ...\n\nI highly recommend this game.

There was ample fun to be had in the game's myriad roles: you could sit in your team's bunker as the commander and spread buildings deliberately towards the enemy base in a game of chess, supplying and defending your pawns; you could play as the hulking siege, crushing the other team's build-out; you could suit up as the the equivalent of the heavy in "Team Fortress 2" to lock down valuable resource points; you could slip through enemy lines as the stealth, literally turning invisible until you were ready to stab sieges, snipers, or even commanders in the back; you could play as a support, healing teammates, repairing the commander's buildings, or wielding flamethrowers and gas grenades; or you could be an "assault" to hunt down spies with your thermal vision and protect all of the other classes around the map.\nUltimately, the game wasn't just about kill-death ratios, the FPS's typical "gold star" award; it was about cooperating with a commander who linked power plants, relays, spawn points, and supply stations across the map to feed you ammo, while you grabbed and defended resource points to help him or her build these structures. Sometimes the matches were over in an instant, with expert commanders extending a few relays right to another commander's base while veteran players held down resource points. Other times, matches turned into classic trench warfare as expert teams clashed, or new players stumbled. Sometimes, commanders were demoted, either because they couldn't get the job done or their teammates didn't understand how to do the job for them. There was little room for goofing off, but plenty of room for brilliantly-executed plans.\nThe game always suffered from a lack of buy-in; it was rare to find all of the servers filled to capacity, and tournament organization was difficult. However, this was counterbalanced by an incredibly close-knit community which simply had fun together, as well as working on mods and Steam Workshop additions. Even as the developer's support waned and server populations dwindled further, the community remained for some time.\nWhile the subsequently released "Natural Selection 2" was graphically astonishing, I found it to be incredibly demanding on my sub-par rig when it came out. This is still a plus over what some might consider previous-gen graphics in the case of ND, although the innovative gameplay more than made up for the graphical shortcomings. The gameplay styles in ND and NS2 were also incredibly different, with NS2 being incredibly fast-paced; the learning curve in NS2 was nearly impossible if, like me, you had no experience jumping into the game. Again, this wasn't necessarily a bad thing, just a difference. The units in ND's two different factions were somewhat unique, although some of these differences were not as big as they could have been - particularly when one looks at the "aliens vs. marines" dynamic of NS2.\nHowever, these comparisons aren't really fair. On it's own - and for its time - ND was a fantastic blast, and still could be. If you can still find a server to play on, it's absolutely worth a shot. For $10, it's not much of a risk at any rate, particularly if a sale happens along.","May 29, 2015","true","738.4"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","14","14","2","0"

Teamwork is very important in this game as the flow of the game chages as well as the current objectives change too (such as defend this area, capture this resourse point etc). Probably more teamwork is involved in this game than tf2, but if you really feel like it you can just run around and kill people like other FPS games. It also has the commander role, the one person who builds all the buildings for your team and plays on an overview map. The commander role ist like playing a RTS but all the units are actual players. It is the unique blend of FPS and RTS that make this game just a blast to play and every time you play it is different than the last.

The hybrid RTS/FPS style of the game is truly unique and its major selling point. The classes are quite balanced and you are forced to switch to a team composition according to changing RTS conditions. Although there is a limited amount of maps, this is a good thing. Every game is unique because every commander has a personal approach as to how expand his base, and intimate map knowledge is required to counter the strategy of the commander.\n\n+ Commander and FPS equally satisfying and really merged with each other in a smooth gameplay experience.\n+ Classes balanced and designed to be able to respond to changing tactical needs.\n+ Game doesn’t grow stale because of good level design and the way the commanders fill the maps.\n\n+/- [updated: as of april 2016] there are still consistently one to two full servers, depending on prime time (I always had a game to play)\n\n- This is a call for increasing the player base.

There is one designated commander (RTS) player while the rest have to take the role as infantry (FPS).\n\nIf you've played natural selection, it's slightly similar to this. You start a game needing to be either a commander or a player (the nice thing about this game that yes you can play against the computer). The commander builds outposts to either provide more weapons, turrets, armory, health and upgrade stations. The players themselves attack and attempt to move forward and gain tactical advantage. The FPS portion of the game is actually quite fluid and visually appealing. I also have to give it to them, they put grenades into the game! Any game that does this I have to give them props. Having more options as a gamer is always welcomed, but the basic of a gun and a grenade I believe in a necessity. Zooming in is also possible with most weapons. Although being a good FPS player will advance most of your team, if the other team has a damn good commander, you may be out of luck. A strong commander is definitely needed for a victory. I should also mention there are different classes to choose from such as stealth assassin or sniper, assault marksmen, riflemen, and grenadier, support engineer, medic or BBQ (I'll leave this for you to explore), and exos which are almost like a super class.\n\nThe visuals from and FPS and even an RTS stand point is rock solid. Although the game is not that old, it's buffering abilities and graphics on either view is still phenomenal. From an RTS stand point, everything is nicely laid out and easy to manage. There is a grid view system in place to help the commander put buildings in place. HUD on either perspective/view is really easy on the eyes and are another fluid design in my opinion. Passing by these buildings that are being put up in FPS mode is absolutely a beautiful design. Sounds are neat and although not extremely diverse, you won't be hearing the same boom's or gun shots over and over.\n\nI will give it a high rating as it attempts to be a hybrid and pushes the gaming genre boundaries.\n\nMy rating will be a solid 8/10\n\nGeneral Gamer's Rating will be 7.4/10","August 30, 2014","true","3.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I would have never thought of buying a game like this until I played it. I'm not in to FPS very much and this game is amazing. When I saw FPS/RTS I expected it to be like the commander missions in CoD Black Ops II but after playing it, I feel ashamed that I compared such an amazing game to a piece of garbage like CoD. Now for a more thorough review.\n\nPROS:\n♦ Team based combat. None of that I-have-a-better-gun-so-I-win bull. This game takes strategy from all levels. Not just the commander but from the infantry as well.\n♦ The classes are fairly even. Obviously people are going to be more skillful than others at classes, but the classes have a great way of creating a "checks and balance" system. The Assault class is good versus stealth, but not against Exo's. Stealth is good against Exo's but not against Assault's, and Exo's are good against Assault's but not against Stealth. (I haven't figured out where Support goes but I believe they are kind of at a disadvantage with combat due to their huge advantage at team help.)\n♦ For those who actually care, graphics aren't too bad. The buildings that are placed in commander mode have nice animations of being built and don't just appear.\n♦ Commander mode is something that is required. You are likely to fail if you do not have a decent commander or no commander at all. I hate FPS's that are filled with people who want fast-paced combat, since I'm more of a stratigizing thinker. Though this is more of an opinion than factual, I thought it'd be worth noting.\n\nCONS:\n♦ The tutorial mission's are slightly glitchy. You still get the basics you need but you don't always go more in depth.\n♦ The multiplayer is mostly dead. I would love to start up some games though if anyone is interested!\n♦ Offline mode isn't challenging after a while since bots will not become commanders. Makes it almost uninteresting. Though it is a good way to get a feel for both the game and the maps.\n\nI hope you found this helpful.

Why doesn't someone create a game which combines these two genres? Why don't infantry units of RTS can't be alive people who see the game as a shooter? And he answered: there is such a game.\n\nAnd then he sent me this as a gift.\n\nFirst start was very tough. I got to the battefiled unprepared and wasn't able to run more than 2 meters and shot a single bullet without being get killed. Then I left the game and played all the tutorials - learning many things about game goal, controls and abilities of the infantry classes.\n\nSecond start was much better - I was aware of things happened but still had to learn what teamwork is. First I was running all over the map a a stealh - thinking that I do good just but having fun with backstabbing. Then I had started to enjoy playing assault grenadier. But any choice in a long term wasn't good either for me or my team. Why?... the only thing every ND player should understand is the TEAMWORK.\n\n...it's not just killing more enemies for you team...\n...it's not shooting the same target with other players...\nIt's understanding NEEDS OF YOU TEAM AT THE MOMENT - destroying enemy structures, repairing and protecting building of your team, capturing resources, providing supplies. Everything requires you to master all the classes and react to every situation, changing tactics and following orders of the commander (who sees a game as RTS). You can have favorite classes, you can be very good with them - but when the time comes you should be ready to swich.\n\nIf you have enemy at you door, sniping hardly will help your team if no one repairs stuff. If enemy bunker is almost down, your assault riffle is useless unless you defend exos from stealths. If you need to capture resources quickly, you would hardly do that with exo unless you have a spawnpoint nearby. Being medic is useless unless there are some players around to be healed. Should I continue? Anyway, after understanding those I fell in love with this game.\n\nCheck the time when most people play and join the battle!","June 24, 2014","true","968.3"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

So make sure to find a team or clan for you. Sometimes you can get angry because your team play badly and you constanly die trying to win. In such moments you need to relax and don't try to win, find a spot where you can hide and  destroy structures or kill enemies. Even in a situation when your team will surely loose you can have much fun killing enemy Heavies (EXOs) with armblades (invisible guy) or sniper rifle.\nI'm not a good RTS player, so it's hard for me to be a commander. Besides maps are very complex and detailed, there are so many pathes and ways to build in every map that I get lost. RTS gamers will probably be interested in playing as a commander, but for me it's hard. It's also inconvenient for me to use RTS camera, I can't see what's happening on the map.\n\nUpdated 2014.12.03\nThe game has some issues which make it less fun to play:\n- performance problems. Frame rate drops significantly (from 100+ fps to 25 fps)  when there are 32 players and lots of structures on map.\n- sounds bugs. when looping sounds are bugged. for each looped sound there are 3 sounds playing, and even if structure is removed the sound remains. Can be worked around by deleting looped sounds from game's installation\n- misc little bugs here and there. Like structure teleportation, server crashes etc\n- Stuckable points. You can stuck in static props and buildings.\n- The annoying sound when hit by explosion. Can't be turned off. And it can sometimes become permanent. snd_restart removes permanent\n- Annoying effects of blood all over the screen when took damage. Can't be turned off.\n- The FPS part is generally not very fun. I think it's because they wanted to make it Call of Duty(COD) like but added too much HP for most classes. So in COD you have fun killing enemies with 2 bullets, but here you have to use 2 mags. E.g. EXO needs 7 head shots to be killed.\n\nFor me the most annoying thing is the frame rate drops.\n\nIn spite of these drawbacks this game is currently the best FPS+RTS game on the market as for me.","December 3, 2012","true","787.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","6"

Solid FPS and RTS elements, with a lower learning curve than say NS2 (which is also great). The lower learning curve DOES NOT mean that it is easy to win or dumbed down in anyway.

There is also a degree of persistent levelling which allow new gadgets/'perks' to be unlocked as players progress.\n\nMaps are pretty big with different play styles associated with each (some of CQB heavy, others more open sniper maps), all of which still require considerable team work in order to succeed.\n\nGiven Nuclear Dawn is built on the Source engine, the graphics are great and really add to the feel of battling it out in a post apocolyptic environment, with many buildings being able to be entered.\n\nIf you're looking for something different from the faster paced CS / BF / CoD one-man-army bullet fest, with a bit more strategic depth and a great community to boot, I would highly recommend Nuclear Dawn.

So sad. I think it's because they stopped developing the game. Why? Who knows? It's really awesome. So come play, get in on the ground floor man!

I've never played anything like it.  A very fun mixture of FPS and RTS.  Two commanders handle the RTS part, the rest play FPS, however, it is up to the FPS players to defend and repair the assets that the commander deploys for them as they work their way to the enemy base.\n\nAttacking players can tactically and strategically decide which assets to take out first:  Power relay, turrets, spawn points, supply stations.  In addition to destoying enemy assets and defending your own, you must fight over resource points.\n\nThe infiltrator has a cloak, and there's lots of fun to be had there.  The backstab is very rewarding, and you can also cloak to the enemy base and assassinate the commanderr in his bunker, and then hang out on the base and delay his commander efforts.\n\nEach class has a special ability, and each primary weapon choice alters your secondary gear as well.  Each major weapon can utilize a Gizmo, which enhances the weapon.  If you like challenges, this game requires a lot of play time to work up the ranks and unlock various enhancements.\n\nLots of fun to be had here with a unique experience.  Don't miss out!

Nuclear Dawn is RTS/FPS mixture, similar to: Natural Selection 2, Savage 2:Tortured Souls. Regarding graphics/sound game is made using source engine therefore you will not find flaws there.\n\nOn the other hand gameplay has much space for improvement:\nIf you plan playing this game as commander, I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT. Reason is simple, commander gameplay is boring for following reasons: 1. You main job is to build structures and repair, which requires resources. 2. You can affect other players by using powers which are limited and expensive (heal, poison, pure dmg, place barricades which are useless), or by using turrets/artillery which is also expensive. From my experience commanding is building, begging players to cap/defend/attack and if that goes well you push your base forward until you zerg enemies base with turrets (missile and close range-sonic/fire) which can be done only if u control almost all resources on map and that is usually the finishing move. Chances of you being comm are low, and if players or you "suck" that game round is waste of time. Like NS2 and S2TS commander heavily depends on FPS players and is pointless to play game in that mode. If the genre would introduce diff design like: comm making BOT AI soldiers which can be possessed by FPS players, comm could instruct BOT AI to follow his orders, and FPS players could have the role of "Heroes", either it is just my humble opinion.\nGameplay as FPS player is quite fun. You have many classes/subclasses, and if you combine your gameplay with other players you are in for a fun ride. If you plan on going solo around the map, you could do that with stealth class but that would be a downfall with low player count match. Game round from FPS perspective is: spawn, capture resource points, die defending it, respawn. Beg commander to place new spawn gates closer to fighting area. Regarding FPS aspect of game I RECOMMEND IT.\nAs the game launched it was big hit. At the moment of writing this review there are 4 servers active, 2 in NA and 2 in Europe. Game still has some players playing, but not as nearly as much as it had at launch date. Many clans have left ND (like TAW), and if you are new player you will mostly play against hard core veterans (lvl 80). I myself am 74th level, Level diff won't affect gameplay. All that matters is your skill and knowledge, luck and good teammates.\nAll in all it was a fun game, still is. If you are willing to give it a chance try it you are welcome to increase playerbase :D.","January 23, 2015","true","125.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

So I've added my own story and it's true, storyline makes a huge difference. Since I added a story, this game has become much more fun. If you find you need a storyline for this game, feel free to use mine. Here is the story: The red side hates the blue side, because the blue side wins at everything. This war has no end in sight, because red will never give up until they win, but blue refuses to lose. With each loss, red gets a little better and the next battle is a little closer... Will red ever win?\nThis story has added hours of replay value to my game.\n\nGameplay:\nEach side has four classes, each with 2 or more weapon loadouts\n-Stealth: hides so he can shank, sabotage or snipe you. Huh, all "S" for stealth.\n-Exo/Heavy/Demo: a tank with legs, he fire missiles or rivers of bullets.\n-Vanilla: He's great at running, so he can get to the combat and die faster.\n-The Handyman: Part doctor, part mechanic, he can probably resurrect your dog too. Also has the BBQ mode, where he wields a flamethrower.\n\nCommanders:\nEach side has a commander and this is what sets this apart from other games of this type. The commander manages all the RTS elements. He must build spawn points, power stations, resupply points, artillery and of course, turrets. Lots and lots of turrets. Heavies will kill them, stealth will slip past and handymen fix yours while vanilla runs around and gets eaten. To counter this, the commander can build a special station that allows them three godlike powers. The smiting power, where enemies within a small circle all die, a circle of life power, where your minions heal within a small circle and the "I'll help you out" power, where enemies are poisoned within a small circle. They don't die, they're just weaker for your minions to kill.\n\nOverall, great game. I'd buy it for $15.","May 17, 2015","true","13.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","2","2","2","1"

Under good command this game delivers. A tip of the hat to the legendary Comms, (Gay_for_Ellis, [TAU] Black Cat, Muon, Tea, Coeffus, The_Bolt, MitchellJames and JHolman to name but a few) for showing good team handling, sound strategies and outstanding patience while guiding us to glory (or defeat, but there can be only one..). The method of matched classes makes for good even play with each class having nuances worthy of investigation. For aussies, this game is always played on US or European servers so your ping will be high - from Victoria I average 250 in the USA and 350 in Europe, but this is no obstacle to those dedicated to enjoying good team-based gameplay. The sessions, when full, are complex and engaging where changing class quickly can win or lose the match. There is a small problem with inexperienced comms taking the helm but a good soldier follows orders and I'm here to help the team win. 3 thumbs up to the devs - not many flaws here...\n\nI wanted to write a good review and a bad review but I can only do one so ... this is the bad one underneath..\n\nDO NOT BUY THIS GAME\nNuclear Dawn WAS a great game - pity it turned to sh*t when the Beta finished. Back during the Beta, people that got the game were interested in game play but a few days after, Cowardice took most of the players' ego and then never let go. Exo-whoring; the propensity for the more gutless to gang up in armour - pity that meant most of the teams. Team-stacking; The choice of champions - where everyone with high rank stacked on the same team totally outclassing the lower ranked with persistent perks. The devs tried over and over to create a way to balance the play but weasels will always find a way to cheat - cowardly weasels anyway. This could have been a great game and I am sorry for the development team as they tried really hard to get something together only to have it ruined by gutless idiots that were not good enough for Black ops but not so bad at working out the easiest ways to overcome the balancing aspects. Three cheers to the guys that destroyed the game; you'll find that they are the lords of it but they now just use exo-whoring and team-stacking to pwn noobs - after the Beta finished there was no chance for noobs to learn and so develop good strategic game-play because of the giant egos of cowards that wanted pwnage over the uninitiated.\nDO NOT BUY THIS GAME; totally populated with tw*ts - should change it's name to "Cowardly Pwn"","April 21, 2014","true","579.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

This makes the game very noob-friendly.\n\nAlthough the game has reduced community numbers, you can usually find a populated server. Even then, if you can't find a server, the game has offline play modes and working bots/AI as well as a lot of singleplayer maps available on the workshop. This gives it a lot of value even now.","December 22, 2014","true","31.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Teamwork can be utilized in many aspects of the game. Such as VoIP, teamchat and covert preplanning.\n3. The achievements are cool. Which is why, players are motivated to take them on.\n4. Most importantly, the graphics kick my back. They are way too awesome.\n\nCON'S\n1. Uncooperative players are nuisance. Try to play on your style, maybe you might persuade them of the team's     condition.\n2. Partial controller support. Could I play as a commander via controller? Insanely fun?\n3.

This multiplayer community was huge back then, this game is interesting because you can play as the commander for either two different armies, and real players will be fighting as you command and build up to help your team win against the others, graphics are a 6/10 for me, sometimes the game can be glitchy and have bugs on it but those are only minor, the main issue I would have to put out about this game is that hitting targets is a bit challenging since the models are very thin and move clunky. Over the years the multiplayer has shrunk significant numbers, you will be lucky to find maybe 4 or 6 servers open.","September 29, 2015","true","195.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's a class-based shooter with various abilities available as you level up your character. There are initially four different classes, and each team has a Commander (with various upgrades including armor, ammo, etc). Each class has three drastically different loadout sets with various weapons in each one. This is where the TF2 influence shines clear through.\n\nI mentioned Unreal Tournament, as well. Unreal Tournament is one of the most well-respected shooters released, and when I compare this game to it, I feel the need to explain myself. The pacing of both games is identical, with a mad dash to objectives resulting in very short life spans with quick spawn times. This allows you to filter in and out of combat with ease, allowing for you to change classes or weapons as needed during combat.\n\nReally fun game in segments, but if it has a weakness, it would be in map structure. Nothing really sticks out in any of the maps, and they mostly seem to be several small rooms loosely connected to eachother, for the most part. Granted, this can be said of most multiplayer FPS games. Regardless, I don't think it's enough of a weakness to merit a poor review, so I'll say wait for a sale, or grab it right now in the Humble Bundle (Feb 25th, 2016)!","February 25","true","0.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Two teams, and each team has a player controlled captain that can place buildings such as turrets, supplies, teleporters, flamethrowers, and need to have power supplies. The captain has to aid his teammates to help concuer the whole map. Even though there is only 4 classes with a small choice in weapons and upgrades, it has tons of playing styles to choose from. This game provides non-stop entertainment, and can have games that last a whole hour.

Online mostly don't have bots unless you can find a server with some. Anyways The game itself is a whole lot based on teamwork, building etc IT LITERALLY IS A hybrid of Real Time Strategy and First Person Shooter. The Commander is a hard job compared to that of being a lowly soldier. You may die a lot easier than usual It's like Battlefield meeting Command and Conquer. If you are a good commander then teammates need you to build the turrets and other useful stuff such as teleporters but you need them to get some good resources in order to further your reasearch. So this is the literal one game where Teamwork is a must and a key to win the Wars of the game. I'd recommend getting the game with the price it still is for the moment or wait for another discount deal to get the game.","April 22, 2014","true","2.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It should be the other way around, with the team taking over the map and the commander supporting them and defending what's already been taken. However, whenever we played we would see one of two high-level players as the commander on the opposite team, and they would do all of the work and decimate us and spawn camp us with an unending barrage of the strongest turrets.

Dis is my first review and I declare this game is Da BOMB DIGGITY. Not just a bomb, or Da Bomb, but the BOMB DIGGITY! (Put Emphasis on Bomb and DIggity).\nSeriously though omg, I just got this game on sale and I love it. I came looking for some kind of war-like tower defense, but I found something better. A perfect combination RTS and FPS. I bought it on sale and its the best 3 dollars I ever spent, I would have definetly bought it for full price, or more.  First day I punched in 5 hours. I'm actually surprised by the small community you might find. This game has VERY LITTLE bugs,  and glitches of the sort. Find yourself as a soldier on the ground with variety of assault, exo (heavy), stealth and support. Or, if your confident enough, you can be the commander, which is no easy job! Having to keep track of objectives, planting towers, and guiding your soldiers and assisting them throughout battle. So many ways to strategize your attack, or defense. As an FPS itself aside as a strategy based game, it is amazing as well. It has something much different to offer than any COD or CounterStrike style. It is certainly more strategy that one much pick a class that goes along with the effect on the battlefield. Need to take objectives, Assualt. Need to defend or need for tank, or towers that need to be taken care of, Exo. Is there a tank bothering you, Stealth. Soldiers dying in the field, or towers needing repair, Support, (Medic or Engineer). It isnt the mostly mindless Run and Gun one would find among other FPS. If you are starting to hate that style, this is the game for you. If one could get some friends together to play this game would be amazing too, because when one plays with cooperation, the true potential of this game is unlocked as you struggle through the tough battles ranging fro  m, 30-60 minutes long. All in all, I cant wait to plug in tons of more hours and if you're deciding, you should join me.

If it, mostly an FPS but there are a few different ways to play the game :\n\n1- You're a simple soldier, on the field. Like in most of the other FPSs, you target an enemy and shoot him down (or he does it). You can choose to have either a shotgun, a sniper or an assault rifle and can detect enemy camos.\n2- You're an assassin, on the field. You can make yourself invisible (become a camo) and stab your enemies from behind OR you just shoot them down with a sniper OR you use some bombs, kinda C4s ('cause you can activate them from a long distance).\n3- You are a BADASS tank with either a BADASS machine-gun or a SUPER BADASS rocket launcher. And like most of the heavy tanks' infantry, you're slow as ****.\n4- You are THE man of the game. You're the commander. You build stuff, as if you were a player of some of the tower defense games but, also, you choose either to upgrade your team, help them while on the field or just go with them.\n\n\nJust seeing this, you (should) guess it's not an FPS like all the others. This one is a mix between Call Of Duty and tower defense's games such as World Of Empire or Plant VS Zombies while being much better.\n\n\n\n\nNow, let's check out the good and bad things of this game...\n\nGOOD\n- multiplayer and solo player available,\n- not bad graphics,\n- an easy controllable shooter, even with a keyboard,\n- a simple but helpful tutorial (to learn of to really play, even though I never even dated to finish it),\n- no stupid players, just a few games entirely made of bots,\n- the online games are never (well, since I started playing) full.\n\nBAD\n- some online games can be so long and, sometimes, start to get you bored,\n- some commanders can't make your team win and the online servers don't have so much players,\n- you need to know how to really play an FPS.\n\n\nSo, yeah. You really need to learn how to play on FPSs ;)","May 11","true","19.6"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

The early to mid game is much fun, but the mid to end game is tedious.\nAll games i played ended in a turret spam, where one team struggled to survive with no chance to advance. The other team just kept spamming turrets into the enemy lines. FYI: Turrets are hard to kill and require demolition equipment like rocket launchers. And this goes on ... forever.\n\nIn addition to that, the playerbase consist of 1 1/2 30 Slots Servers in Europe while the game is on sale.\n\nSadly, I can't recommend you this game. It's has a tedious end game, plus there is no playerbase/it's dieing.","March 2, 2015","false","2.8"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

First i should go over the pros of this game, and trust me there are plenty.\nNow this game treats the RTS and the FPS as two completly corresponding things. You need your Commander (The one player who has the RTS view) and he needs you. As a normal FPS player, you go around accomplishing objectives and killing the enemy team when possible. However if the Commander feels there is something you should all focus on, he may simply issue a comand, and you can see a position in which he wants to defend or attack. The commander also is responsible for building important structures, such as Teleporters, Supply Stations, Armorys and Artilery cannons, and better yet the Artilery cannons have the option for the commander to own them entirley, or for his troops to be able to call in for some support. This adds yet another unique combination of RTS and FPS.\nA couple of things I found slightly discouraging were the fact that some kits are locked until the commander forks over the resources to reasearch them for your team, and once he does, then you can acess them, but until then you will just have to stare at that Rocket launcer, or grenade launcher until your commander decides he wants you to have it. Another things i find distasteful is the lack of weapon kits, 3 per class(Including the one you need to unlock), yet all of them seem fitting so its not actually too much of a problem. an upside to this is a new player will have the acess to the same weapons as any veteran, which I enjoy, because in many FPS games I have played, veterans usually have an advantage with far better weapons than new players.\nAll in all I would completly recommend Nuclear Dawn to anyone who likes FPS games and RTS games. It beautifully mixs the two and deserves far more fame than it has, I feel if the developers had added more guns and structures this game would be all the rage same as games like Call of Duty and Battlefield, but that is just my opinion, so i will leave it to you to form your own opinion of this game.\nHave Fun","December 11, 2013","true","12.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Fantastic weapons, well thought out classes, tactical maps, and overall a pretty essensial game for only £6.99. I would maybe like to see a few more maps, maybe another class or two, and possibly a bit more weapon customization (there are multiple loadouts for each class which kind-of makes up for it). The only real problem I have is that there is only one game mode (as far as I am aware). This is fun as long as you play different tactics and switch commander (a team leader who builds spawn points, turrets, power stations, supplies etc.) every now and again.","April 30, 2014","true","11.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The game has a RTS element meaning there is a player playing the role of  a Commander who gives you orders and sets points to spawn and supply units and all needed support.\nSo if you don't want to run around not knowing what to do, or feel like learning a lot of strategy, this will help you at playing if you follow orders and help others.\n\nThe RTS part is even better, being a commander you can communicate orders that people might or might not follow. You set up a network of power units, supply units and spawnpoints, those are bought with credits you get by your team capturing points. It's not too complicated but can take some time getting a winning strategy and depends hugely on the players playing.\n\nOverall it's surely is one of my favorite games, favorite FPS and is the one I play when I don't want to think too much, just sit back and follow orders and contribute my part to the team.","January 31, 2014","true","7.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamehoard/recommended/17710/","gamehoard","Jeremy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamehoard/","173 products in account","If you'd like to hear my full thoughts on Nuclear Dawn, you can listen to the episode on Game Hoard Podcast[soundcloud.com]\n\nNuclear Dawn pits two teams against each other as they vie for control points and try to push their offensive into the other team's base. One player on each team takes the role of the commander and views the battlefield from an overhead view, effectively playing the game as an RTS. The commander groups players into squads, issues orders, constructs buildings, and lends battlefield assistance. Meanwhile other players can choose between four classes: assault, exo (i.e. heavy), support, and stealth. Within each class there are also different loadouts available.\n\nWhat makes Nuclear Dawn great is that it really does play well as both a shooter and a strategy game. No team can succeed without both the commander and the other players doing a good job and working together. I was surprised by how much being a commander actually felt like playing an RTS.\n\nOn the negative side of things, the whole aesthetic of the game is fairly generic and uninteresting. It's basically all just slightly futuristic war-torn gray/brown cities and cookie cutter soldiers without that well-defined of a setting. I found that it made it a bit difficult to learn the map layouts since everything just looked so similar.\n\nAlso problematic is that building very often get in the way of the commander's view and I wish that they would have been made transparent for the commander. It often means that you have to do a fair bit of manipulating the camera to see the action.\n\nOverall, Nuclear Dawn is a great competitive online experience. While the game is a bit old, I could still always find at least one server with a fair number of players, so it's still worth getting for that. If you want a game to play online that takes some time to get into and does something a little more interesting than your typical team deathmatch, I can definitely recommend Nuclear Dawn.","April 25","true","1.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

And, it is one of the better ones.\n\nFirst, lets see what is so good in this game. The mechanics are great. The use of weapons feel natural and easy to handle. The arsenal is also acceptable. Core maps are well designed allowing multiple playing styles and tactics to use. The classes felt balanced and competitive against each other. There are some unlockable customization options also which can be used to earn a little bit of advantage, but they are not that much they could ruin the fun. Strategy elements are well implemented requiring a good commander and teamwork.\nI also need to mention the worse parts of the game. The content is somewhat less than it would be ideal, but since release the developers made tools to aid the community, just before they abandoned the game for good. But, you can now have some good custom built maps and stuff from workshop. However, now comes the worst aspect of the game, its current playerbase. To be able to play this game ideally, you would need one applicable commander and at least five people in your team. Also, teamwork is necessary for success. Now, when the game has only a minimal amount of regular players you can hardly play a match in normal circumstances. Bots can be deployed in both online and offline play, but they are only half-solution. Also, they cannot control the constructions, so someone will still need to take care of the commander duties.\n\nThis game had its time in the competitive multiplayer scene, but it is surely one of those games that should not be forgotten due the amount of fun that it can give those who really spend time and effort to it.\n\nMy Opinion:\nOVERALL: 7.5/10\nGraphics: 8/10\nGameplay: 8/10\nSound: 7/10\nReplay Value: 7/10","December 27, 2011","true","15.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Could have been more developed but I feel it's on pair with the most FPS games. However the RTS part... That's the deal breaker. It's interesting. It's new. But it mostly feels like a chore... You don't really control the troops since those are players who most of time won't understand you and their role in the greater scheme of things. So in the end all you seem to do is build stuff to protect yourself and support them... You're not the commander, you're their hoe.\n\nFinally, just like every other indie online game servers might be empty most of the time, and you have to play with other players... Don't take this in the wrong direction, but the thing is this game relies far more on your team and commander than the regular FPS due the RTS elements, so having some players won't just cut it.\n\nBut all in all I guess I should still recommend this game. Despite being a somewhat failure, it tried a new and bold approach on both genres. So play it if you're interested in learning a lesson and try out something different.","April 18, 2012","true","5.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Which is a shame, because it has a lot of potential and is a good amount of fun even at the moment of writing this. It's a RTS/FPS mixup game and the mixing up works quite well. The game has some issues like matches dragging on forever even though the losing team is pushed back to their base with no chance of coming back or using an XP-System that lets you level up soooo slowly without giving you any real bonus for actually doing so. The main problem is the lack of a playerbase, usually there is one server that is populated and one that is half-populated.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/poorboy13/recommended/17710/","poorboy13","poorboy[MH4U]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/poorboy13/","333 products in account","I bought this game with high expectations. Some may judge me for this. However, with the amount of advertising that once flooded the internet for this game, I thought that the extra advertising effort displayed how much work was put into the game.\n\nI am a huge fan of both RTS and FPS games. I had even dreamed of designing a hybrid one day. Then this game came along and offered both. Of course I had to buy it... only to be disappointed. The first of the problems was in choosing the engine; the Source engine is dated and ugly. Things that had potential to look awesome simply didn't. The menu and interface is ugly. The textures are blurry and the lighting is lousy. Not a pretty game.\n\nBut many agree that graphics are not the most important aspect. Okay, granted. Let's throw graphics completey out. How does the game play? There are lots of tactical decisions made, and I appreciated how the game was less "Go out and kill people" and more "Follow the orders of the person who can see what's happening". But what if the person who was elected commander is actually an idiot? Well... too bad. You are definitely going to lose. Playing as soldiers isn't much better; the assasin's blade is supposed to be able to back-stab in one hit, similar to the Spy in Team Fortress 2. A slight miss means betraying your position and unsuccesfully killing the enemy, even if the hit still hits the guy in the back: this glitch irritated me no end.\n\nBut people will always be idiots in public matches. So you want to play alone. How does that do? In a word: terrible. Even worse, in fact. When in commander mode (since AI refuses to be a commander for either team) you face an unmotivated enemy that does not desire to expand their base and spams non-stop uncoordinated attacks at you. If you took the helm as a commander, giving orders only pains you as you watch your teammate's miserable pathfinding get them all stuck before they reach your designated target. After a long, gruelling match you may wind up in victory after expanding your base all the way to the door of the enemy's base. But it won't be FUN. Isn't that what's important? After finally destroying the pitiful structures the enemy thinks is a base, you will sit back and ask, "Did I actually enjoy any of that??"\n\nThe game shows potential, but unfortunately not much else. If you managed to find 9 other buddies to do a LAN party, then maybe it might be kinda enjoyable. But at its current price range, it is not worth the buy. Maybe if it went free2play with cosmetic upgrades, or maybe sank sub-$5 range, it would be more worth your time.\n\n4/10. Avoid.","August 26, 2014","false","1.8"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","2"

Feels more like an unfinished mod than a commercial game.\n\nPoorly balanced. Maps generally favour 1 side over the other. Too many unavoidable insta-kills (commander-ability? wtf?).  "Structure under attack" spammed every 10 seconds. No REAL way to destroy buildings, takes a large group of a specific class to do any meaningful damage to them. A lot of guns are useless and do ♥♥♥♥-poor damage. The most annoying HUD you will ever see. Squads have no functionality (no orders, spawning), they're just there for the hell of it.\n\nWorst of all, the endgame pretty much consists of a drawn-out 5-10 minute spawncamp. Spawn, die.

There's a great deal of glaring problems that haven't been fixed since the 2011 release date.\n\nThe 'Human turret' feature of the exo is bad. A very limited FOM and quick turning speed. It should be 180 degrees turning but with a speed reduction.\nThe EXO is overpowered. You can destroy people at close range and long range with ease.\nChoice of weapons is extremely limited, By which I mean you get about less than 20 in the whole game.\nStealth is just a silly class. You can uncloak instantly and then shoot somebody or stab them, Then go invisible again. It doesn't even OHK on a backstab.\nThe length of the cloak on the stealth is too long.\nAssault shouldn't have constant thermal vision. Have it so that you flick it on sometimes just to give the place a check over.\nWeapons take FAR too long to kill. I have 30 bullets in my MP7 but I can't kill one person with that? Give me some slack.\nGive us health regen. Like 1 health a second or maybe 1 health per 2 seconds. It's so rare to find a medic or a supply station.\nIron sights on all the guns are disgusting. I'd like to track my enemy's head without them hiding behind my own damn gun.\nEngineers should be able to construct buildings. Commanders don't often put them in tactical positions.\nGrenades are clunky. You throw them too quickly and they hardly kill.\n\nThese are just the problems I spotted in my first hour of gameplay.

It's like a car with no gas at the moment so even if you think that getting it for two or three dollar's is a bargain then go ahead, prove your doubts.\n\n(I know, I did)\n\nFinally I'll say dev's did a good job, no 'monie stealez', 'big bad bugz'(the tutorial was a big messed up but I survived), just a simple game on the platter. Sadly it's feels more extinct than a dodo right now.\n\nAnd from here on the TL:DR section or my 'rant' starts.\n\nI was lucky enough to have access to battle zone II, if you know the game then it saves me the trouble of explaining how 'similar' or 'different' it was to Nuclear Dawn  but if not. It was and still is very 'similar' but 'different' to Nuclear Dawn. Google the game if you're interested.\n\nAmazing concept plus theory combined with a fluid-ish game mechanics make's this one hell of a decent competetor on steam for a low hardware spec game. The only problem is that the mechanics of the commander/RTS are overshadowed by the Shooter/fps. Now all this jargon is for the time when the game has a player base.\n\nAt the moment of writing this review, umm... give or take two minute's. I literally counted 7 player's including me, the 6 on a new york server and I starring in horror, remembering the previous reviews about the game.\n\nAn honest message to the devs/owner's. This IP of your's is near death, I payed, played and finally I'm praying that I can get my measely two dollars refunded. It might seem like a really penny pinching move and honestly I won't argue. It is one, though I stand by my thoughts that this game is at the moment broken. Not by design, code or bugs but by ergonomic means.\n\nAll work and no praise make's dev really grinchy, especially the one's who turned this idea into a reality. A really good idea for the record so kudos for that.\n\nI'll end this rant on the note that by no means after getting through the tutorial I felt the urge to rip open the ethernet cable to open the 'Internetz' rift and finding the devs and tickle torture them. I honestly feel sad that this game is in such a remorseful state.\n\nI'd buy this game on it's full price if it was still 'alive'. Oh, for reading till here I have an advice for devs. Make the game f2p.\n\nI know I know, just a penny pinching move by a broke ♥♥♥ guy but I'd say it's words of a 'wise' broke ♥♥♥ guy telling you to throw a Final Hail Mary.\n\nRevive the player base and to make money introduce DLC with different game mode's. Hell charge player's to be able to play as the commander. Introduce skins to make profits or recoup the losses. The game is there, it's either that or just shelve this IP and move on if it's not worth the while.\n\nThat's all folks\n-fin","October 20, 2015","false","0.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/colonsimulator/recommended/17710/","colonsimulator","Hippo Turtle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/colonsimulator/","1772 products in account","Nuclear Dawn is at the end of its life. Even though there are many servers that are running, only one of them seems to be active with human players at any time. The problem with that server is that it's located in Europe, and the ping is around 200 or higher for me. The maps and environments look great. The futuristic science fiction aesthetic works really well with the weapons and special abilities. Each of the four classes offer a varied and atypical approach to combat. The unlocks also seem to help you through the battles, even though it takes a while to get them through the experience system. In addition, there are many weapon kit loadouts available to all classes; making gameplay very different through the combination of classes, loadouts, and unlocks. Resource capturing can be extremely fun while trying to dodge bullets from enemy fire, and if you have a good commander, you will be in an excellent position to push forward against the enemy's main base. Speaking of the commander feature, this can also make or break your enjoyment of Nuclear Dawn. Commanders require experience and know-how of the game. From extensive knowledge of map locations, to the much needed in-depth tactical familiarity required at different times throughout the match, and the placement of necessary strategic structures around the map. Even though the game allows for players to start a mutiny vote against the commander, finding a good player to fill that role can sometimes be problematic. The commander must also be caring, as she or he should not approach the job as a one person show. This commander mechanic is very similar to the one found in Natural Selection 2. While all of these features sound as though they meld together an amazing, thoroughly enjoyable gaming experience, the sad fact that the multiplayer community is basically dead defeats all chances of greatness and playability. Unless you are specifically in Europe, Nuclear Dawn simply cannot be enjoyed to its full potential. Its solitary European populated server whose ping is well in the 200s makes this game completely unplayable for me. Even if you are in Europe, there will be many times that you will join the one server, and it will only have three or four people playing. This is a multiplayer online only game without a community. Maybe the upcoming update that will supposedly also add native Linux support will help.\n\nNuclear Dawn is okay.","January 25, 2014","true","23.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

It's where the fun is truly at and will help you understand what you need to do as a typical soldier on the ground.\nThe game is still glitchy at times, with show-stopping bugs that can keep an entire team from getting access to "advanced kits", which is kind of a keystone to making sure an entire group of game-players can have a ghost of a chance at putting up a fight against their opponents.\nI think the EXO is overpowered in pub play, making their minigun a veritable sniper rifle in spite of the presence of cloakers who can 1 shot backstab anything.

That being said, it needs a lot of work. First and most important is gamepad support. I'm using the Logitec F710 Gamepad. If you're not familiar, it's the gamepad you see in the Controller Support badges on some game's store page. There's no way to operate as commander (rts mode), switch weapons, or select commands for your team with my gamepad. Operating the menu is nearly impossible and you cannot play through the tutorials without using your keyboard. Very annoying. Server selection is moderate at best. Normally there are 2 or 3 servers which have 20-32 players, 2 or 3 with under 10, and the rest are empty. I'm currently running Ubuntu 14.04. The following problem may be isolated to Linux, but it's worth mentioning. After I play 2-3 matches this game freaks out. It starts lagging in the menu (and in game) so bad that I have to close the application from the desktop. The 'quit' button doesn't even work.

I'll revise later if I'm somehow to blame for the lack of information provided.\n\nNow, in training, the assault class is straightforward enough to not be a problem. Point and shoot, use goggles for seeing stealth. Straight to the point, no questions, no confusion.\n\nExo training is where things started getting vague. I'm told that I'm heavy, with a lack of mobility, and am told to use the minigun to eliminate some targets, followed by the class special with lockdown. Right after this, I'm told about a siege weapon, and told to destroy the target using an M95. BUT the problem is that there's NO EXPLANATION about which button to press to get to the M95, or whether I need to change kits, or how to change kits. Nothing is given whatsoever, so I was left to using the chaingun to destroy the remaining structures. I'm not sure if I'm missing it in the interface somewhere or whether there's no option to customize as a level 0, but either way, it's literally impossible that I should or could know this information. They need to specify what the hell I need to do and what button or section does it.\n\nStealth again was straightforward as far as the training, but I can speak as to the difficulty of the class regarding any of the kits since they don't train you with anything but the generic first kit. Which is also frustrating, since I would like to test out each of the sub classes. THAT'S WHAT TRAINING IS SUPPOSED TO BE FOR.\n\nLastly, support training, which seems like it should be pretty easy to learn, if it weren't for not being able to find how to change kits. I'm told to drop a health kit, then to destroy an enemy supply station with my torch, followed by repairing a friendly one. The problem is that I'm put into the medic kit, then not told how to change to the engineer kit. Effectively making my tutorial an impossible cockblock that can't be bypassed.\n\nSo, in summary, more explanation is needed in the training, as well as a more in depth tutorial on kits and at least basics of how to switch between them. Especially in the training sections, where we're learning how to play the damn game for the first time.","May 18, 2015","false","2.1"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","3"

I felt that I should give it a solid chance and so I played the tutorial and a couple games before writing this. Nuclear Dawn has a cool idea.

Can you name a single thing that Source does better than other engines?  I ask because the only reason I can see to down vote my review is my stance on Source (which has such a cult following it'd make Taylor Swift jealous - and it's equally lackluster compared to its competition).  Nothing else I said here is really debatable.  The tutorial IS broken, the achievement IS unobtainable, and the crouch/sniper issues remain.  Even if this was done in Unreal it'd still get a negative review from me.  Of course, then I doubt these issues would happen in the first place.  Anyhow, onward to my review for anyone who still cares to read it...\n\nThis is yet another game held back by the Source Engine.  Yes, you read that right.  I said it.\n\nThe truth is that the Source Engine - much beloved by (nearly) all - is an outdated relic that gained a sterling reputation in 2004 as a good engine - and then nobody ever through to question that again.  Meanwhile, Unreal Enginer 3 (or really even UE2), idTech 4/5, or something like Unity are now far superior in every measurable way to Source Engine.\n\nIf this game has been on Unreal Engine 2 (or better yet, 3) I wouldn't be uninstalling it right now.  But yeah, the engine ruins the game here.  If anyone wants specific notations, here ya go:\n\nThe FPS/RTS hybrid model works brilliantly in this game.  I have played actual RTS games that weren't this good even on the RTS side, the the FPS is your standard near-future military shooter.\n\nHowever, this is where source starts to rear its ugly head.  Unlike every other FPS engine in existance, you cannot stop walking mid-step.  This makes for awkward movement that feels like you're controlling a 9 legged elephant rather than a human, and makes taking any semblence of aim while your character is moving impossible.  This movement is just like TF2, another Source Engine title, and I can't stand it there either.\n\nThe sniper rifles lack variable zoom.  While not terribly uncommon for sniper rifles in modern FPS games to lack variable zoom, this is still a mark against it, and once again this is made worse by the use of Source Engine.  Whereas other games might allow you to crouch and stay there, Source forces you to constantly hold the crouch key to remain crouched.  And unlike other engines where this is the case, the game lacks even an option to make crouch a toggle.  This means you're stuck quickscoping everything, or else not playing a sniper, because the standard Assault Rifle is accurate, when hip-fired, to almost the same range as your sniper rifle is zoomed.  Since you can't really crouch and you have the lowest health, you are left 100% dependant on your cloak just to survive at all with the stealth kit - and it takes 3x as long to recharge as it does to discharge.  Which would be fine, if you could more easily crouch behind cover...which you can't, because Source.\n\nThe tutorial is broken.  While the RTS tutorial works fine, there are two points in the FPS tutorial where the game is supposed to forcibly change your loadout for you...and it doesn't.  The first time you are playing the "heavy" class and it's supposed to change your chaingun for a rocket launcher, but you can reload about a dozen times and still complete that section with the chaingun.  The last tutorial, for the support class, is supposed to equip a repair torch.  Unlike the other bug, there is no way around this and so players who try to get every achievement need to take note - THE ACHIEVEMENT FOR COMPLETING THE SECOND TUTORIAL IS UNOBTAINABLE.  Frankly, once again, I'm blaming this on Source, though in this case I am not 100% sure it's an engine-related issue.\n\nAll in all, great concept, and very good execution DESPITE the source engine.  I'm still not gonna play it any more though, because the problems and quirks of Source bug me too much to enjoy the game itself.","July 26, 2015","false","2.0"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

Unfortunately the claim that it doesn't cripple or dilute either side of the FPS/RTS gameplay is quite wrong as far as the RTS side goes. As an RTS fan I can tell you that being the commander in this game is not at all like playing an RTS. Construction of buidlings is slow and limited, orders are pretty much just always ignored, and its rare that you actually get to do something useful. Very boring. I wonder when developers of FPS/RTS hybrids are going to realize that in an RTS you need to have units to control, not just a bunch of human players who will run around doing whatever they want and ignore you?\n\nMy larger gripe as far as the game overall goes is that it takes a very long time to complete a match, yet the outcome is almost always clear within the first few minutes. You always know who's going to win in spite of a few minor pushes back and forth and virtually the entire match is just a matter of the obvious losers doing everything in their power to delay the inevitable. Very frustrating and boring regardless of which side you're on.","October 26, 2014","false","7.9"," 10 of 26 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","10","26","0","5"

The graphics are suprisingly good for a 2011 game - I was stunned by some of the interiors. There are some flaws though. The guns feel weird (in a bad way) and movement is floaty. The inclusion of ironsights irks me to no end. In terms of size the community is completely dead by my standards (2 servers at the best of times), although at least what remains is friendly. The amount of commander buildings/research is roughly on par with Natural Selection 1 - whch has always been too little IMO. The potental for massive turnarounds is quite low past the first 5-10 minutes, which often leads to drawn out, rather pointless games. With all that said, I am able to still recommend the game, but mostly to people who are already fans of the genre (FPS-RTS hybrid).","January 5, 2015","true","15.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The other Classes such as Sniper and Medic all have different sub classes. How ever I do have to admit that this game is more of a casual mind set to it.

Some of my favorites being Zombie Master, Synergy, and this game. I remember playing the free weekend for this game around 2011 or 2012 and remembering how much I liked it. The gameplay is pretty cool, combines elements of both FPS and RTS, the commander gets an RTS Eagle-Eye view and can place a bunch of structures and so forth. The FPS gameplay is your standard shooter, point crosshairs at baddies, destroy enemy structures and so forth.\n\nHowever, one thing really bothers me about this game: How come there aren't that many people playing? The game is fun, and with the addition of trading cards and Steamworks support, you'd think the game would be a little more popular. That's not to say there's absolutely nobody playing, while the community is small, it seems to be a very dedicated one. You should be able to makes a few friends pretty fast on here.\n\nThe game creates a nice twist by incorporating RTS elements into the mix, anyone who is a fan of team-based, squad combat shooters should feel right at home with this game.

On the other side of things, as a player on the ground, you are in FPS mode as one of four classes, killing the enemy and taking over resources. The more resources you have, the more things your commander can build. It's like currency. They can't build if the FPS players can't get the points captured, but they need the help from the RTS guy, too. This game is amazing with some really unique playstyles.

The game is a FPS with persistant player stats, deployable structes, c&h objectives, seige objectives, a class system, and an array of perks and weapons. And it is a package done on the whole in a very unique manner. On each side one person will enter a command both, and play the game as a RTS overlay, while the rest of the team plays as a fps. The comander will deploy structures, can issue orders (which generate xp for the ground troops when followed), research tech, and so on. A lot of a good round depends on having a good comander... thankfully, there are voting tools that let a team have control over who is running the show. The FPS action can be fast and intense, and is often a good time. The only real weakness of the game is the fairly small player pool at this time. Not to worry, there are games going on all the time, but it would be nice to see more severs with player numbers posted.\n","October 29, 2011","true","13.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Each team has one commander that plays the RTS role. They build turrets, extend their range, drop supplies, open up waypoints. All the fun stuff, but are still a FPS player sitting in a base. On the other side of things, as a player on the ground, you are in FPS mode as one of four classes, killing the enemy and taking over resources. The more resources you have, the more things your commander can build. It's like currency. They can't build if the FPS players can't get the points captured, but they need the help from the RTS guy, too. This game is amazing with some really unique playstyles.

What if... there was a game that could have both in a futuristic enviroment? Well, there you have it: Nuclear Dawn mixes a class-based FPS with the RTS element - a commander who can issue orders, deploy turrets, suplies and reinforcements, only to make your life easier.\n\nThere are four classes in the game, each with their own characteristics: The Assault - that can see invisible enemies, the Exo -  Heavy Artillery, the Stealth - Do I need to say which class gets invisible?, and the Support.\nEvery class has its own "subclasses", that can be medics, engineers, saboteurs, snipers and etc.\n\nMaps are big enough, with lots of controls points and some nice chokepoints.\n\nAlmost all gamers I've met so far are polite - with only a few exceptions.\n\nOnly downsize: There are no Brazilian servers.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nPT-BR\n\nVocê gosta de jogos de tiro em primeira pessoa?

Tudo para facilitar sua vida.\n\nExistem quatro classes no jogo, cada uma com sua própria característica: "Assault" - que podem ver os personagens invisíveis, "Exo" - a artilharia pesada, "Stealth" - Preciso falar quem fica invisível?, e "Suporte".\nCada classe tem suas próprias subclasses, que podem ser médicos, engenheiros, sabotadores, atiradores de elite e etc.\n\nOs mapas são suficientemente grandes, com muitos pontos de controle e gargalos.\n\nQuase todos os jogadores que conheci eram educados - com algumas excessões (todos eram norte-americanos).\n\nDefeito: Não existem servidores brasileiros, mas se mais pessoas jogares, quem sabe alguém não se comove e não ganhamos servidores também?","August 9, 2013","true","17.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What if... there was a game that could have both in a futuristic enviroment? Well, there you have it: Nuclear Dawn mixes a class-based FPS with the RTS element - a commander who can issue orders, deploy turrets, suplies and reinforcements, only to make your life easier.\n\nThere are four classes in the game, each with their own characteristics: The Assault - that can see invisible enemies, the Exo -  Heavy Artillery, the Stealth - Do I need to say which class gets invisible?, and the Support.\nEvery class has its own "subclasses", that can be medics, engineers, saboteurs, snipers and etc.\n\nMaps are big enough, with lots of controls points and some nice chokepoints.\n\nAlmost all gamers I've met so far are polite - with only a few exceptions.\n\nOnly downsize: There are no Brazilian servers.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nPT-BR\n\nVocê gosta de jogos de tiro em primeira pessoa? E de estratégia? E se... houvesse um jogo que pudesse incorporar ambos em um cenário futurista? Bem, aqui está: "Nuclear Dawn" mistura um jogo de tiro em primeira pessoa baseado em classes com o elemento de estratégia em tempo real - um comandante que pode dar ordens, posicionar torres, suprimentos e reforços no campo de batalha. Tudo para facilitar sua vida.\n\nExistem quatro classes no jogo, cada uma com sua própria característica: "Assault" - que podem ver os personagens invisíveis, "Exo" - a artilharia pesada, "Stealth" - Preciso falar quem fica invisível?, e "Suporte".\nCada classe tem suas próprias subclasses, que podem ser médicos, engenheiros, sabotadores, atiradores de elite e etc.\n\nOs mapas são suficientemente grandes, com muitos pontos de controle e gargalos.\n\nQuase todos os jogadores que conheci eram educados - com algumas excessões (todos eram norte-americanos).\n\nDefeito: Não existem servidores brasileiros, mas se mais pessoas jogares, quem sabe alguém não se comove e não ganhamos servidores também?","August 9, 2013","true","17.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Love the industry trend of blending RTS and FPS, which Nuclear Dawn continues quite well.  However, the game does not handle multiple displays, resulting in mouse panning in the wrong direction (that of the extended display) leaving the game window and scrolling to the edge of the game map within the game.  Sure this can be avoided by reconfiguring ones displays before launching the game, but no one should have to do that.  Any game that uses mouse panning should prevent the mouse from leaving the game screen, especially when run full screen.","July 13, 2014","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is a FPS with persistant player stats, deployable structes, c&h objectives, seige objectives, a class system, and an array of perks and weapons. And it is a package done on the whole in a very unique manner. On each side one person will enter a command both, and play the game as a RTS overlay, while the rest of the team plays as a fps. The comander will deploy structures, can issue orders (which generate xp for the ground troops when followed), research tech, and so on. A lot of a good round depends on having a good comander... thankfully, there are voting tools that let a team have control over who is running the show. The FPS action can be fast and intense, and is often a good time. The only real weakness of the game is the fairly small player pool at this time. Not to worry, there are games going on all the time, but it would be nice to see more severs with player numbers posted.\n","October 29, 2011","true","13.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Love the industry trend of blending RTS and FPS, which Nuclear Dawn continues quite well.  However, the game does not handle multiple displays, resulting in mouse panning in the wrong direction (that of the extended display) leaving the game window and scrolling to the edge of the game map within the game.  Sure this can be avoided by reconfiguring ones displays before launching the game, but no one should have to do that.

Some of my favorites being Zombie Master, Synergy, and this game. I remember playing the free weekend for this game around 2011 or 2012 and remembering how much I liked it. The gameplay is pretty cool, combines elements of both FPS and RTS, the commander gets an RTS Eagle-Eye view and can place a bunch of structures and so forth. The FPS gameplay is your standard shooter, point crosshairs at baddies, destroy enemy structures and so forth.\n\nHowever, one thing really bothers me about this game: How come there aren't that many people playing? The game is fun, and with the addition of trading cards and Steamworks support, you'd think the game would be a little more popular. That's not to say there's absolutely nobody playing, while the community is small, it seems to be a very dedicated one. You should be able to makes a few friends pretty fast on here.\n\nThe game creates a nice twist by incorporating RTS elements into the mix, anyone who is a fan of team-based, squad combat shooters should feel right at home with this game.

I've got 1000+ hours into TF2 and I could see spending that much time in this Nuclear Dawn if it had a more active community. The replayability is huge, and with mods there's really no ceiling to how immersive this game could grow to be. Why? Because it appeals to a broader base and it's excitingly multi-dimensional. It's a great shooter, but if you aren't in the mood for gunfighting, you can command, and commanding people instead of sprites adds a whole different dimension. If you care about your soldiers as a commander, you can support one another's goals to huge success. Though I consider it an extremely desireable feature, the Achilles' Heel of this game is its dependence on leadership.\nEven more than the Battlefield series, not having a commander, or following an ineffective one, greatly undermines the team's chances to win. The soldiers rely on the commander providing upgrades, transport, and supplies they need to stay competitive.\nOn the ground, gameplay feels a lot like Battlefield built over the Source engine, which is essentially what it is. Also a bonus, IMO. Squads, lots of adaptations to classes and unlocks, and pretty enjoyable from a lot of angles. If you're a purist in any one area, this may not be your bag. It's  not perfect at anything, but it's really good at almost everything.\nI'd love to see Nuclear Dawn make a comeback. I think this game really deserves a second look.\n\n\n","May 5, 2015","true","90.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unfortunately, lack of support from the developer, lack of advertisements to let people know this game existed condemned this game into being relatively unknown.  When I was playing, there was an obvious balance issue between teams, and the games would boil down to spamming rockets into the enemy base until the game ends.\n\nDue to lack of servers and support, the player gap was huge.  Good players and new players on the same server can be quite frustrating, even more so to the new players who can't even contribute because they die too quickly from a head shot.\n\nI don't know the state of the game now, but I would think that the developer all but abandoned this game.  It's quite unfortunate that this game went relatively undiscovered.  I think EA could learn from this game, and how to evolve the commander position in Battle Field.","May 17, 2015","true","9.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Finally a game where  the efforts of your team really show and make a differnence. One of the more enjoyable shooters i have played this year. ND is a unique twist on the fps/rts hybrid model.  To sum it up, each team has a commander which plays rts style. everyone else plays as a class based fps game. There are 4 classes and each one has a sub class to it as well. Each class feels good and has its own strengths and weakness. The commander portion is a blast, but does have a bit of a learning curve. The gameplay beats out a lot of AAA titles that have been released as of late. My only complaint is that its a tad lite on content atm. With only 1 game mode and 6 maps, it does leave a bit to be desired. However, the developers are exellent with communicating to the community, vehicles and more maps/modes are on there way. For 25$, you will get your money out of whats already here. I cant stress this enough, communication and teamwork are key to this game.","October 15, 2011","true","83.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Dont expect a highly polished RTS part on the commanders side, though it is deep enough to promote strategical decisions.\n\nDepending on class, the pace is very fast (Stealth Class) to medium (Exo Class). Spawntimes are about 10sec and spawnpoints are dynamically build by the commander or destroyed by the enemy. Map design could be better, leaving you confused about blocked entries or dead areas, but overall it is getting the job done of creating main chokepoints and sideway entries where the balance of power can easily shift between the 2 teams, requiring each team to adapt to the new situation created by the enemy commander, like a newly placed missile turret or healing station.","October 15, 2011","true","25.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's not the prettiest graphics wise as it does show a certain amount of age but I do like what it was attempting. The FPS side of things are fairly simple to understand and RTS side, it's not too hard to understand.\n\nBut now onto the problems that I found with the game.\n\nFirst of all, the AI. It was a few patches ago that they introduced the AI System and while it mean you can play by yourself, the game originally was designed for Player vs Player interactions. And as such, the AI opponent will never build any buildings and will just simply run endlessly at your base, guns blazing and probably would only win if you decide to quit.\n\nYour AI teammates are just as thick and one time while I was stuck in my command chair, I ordered my underlings to capture a crucial point that was 5 feet away from the spawner. They gave me the affirmmative and I waited until they moved into the point. Now it takes three to capture this crucial location and there were five of them that had used the spawner. Only one of the bots made it into the capture range. The rest stopped against a knee high fence and stared at their lonely comrade with maybe a longing glance. And nothing I did afterwards could make them move and the enemy AI was pressumably doing the same thing somewhere else as they were notably absent.\n\nThe maps are fun enough, albeit a bit small feeling if you're a seasoned RTS player. FPS wise, the indoor areas are great for firefights but when it comes to fighting outside, things can be a bit one sided if the enemy commander can just hail nukes on you and insta-kill you from the get-go.\n\nIt's a good game, don't take things the wrong way, but the AI do need some improvements. At least they don't complain that you're hacking when you headshot dominate them the whole game.\n\n\n[Original: One of the most awesomest FPS on Steam. Great deal of fun.","December 31, 2011","true","14.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
