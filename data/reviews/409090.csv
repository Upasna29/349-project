With beautifully hand-painted artwork, imaginative setting and puzzles that will have your mind in knots, there is plenty to appreciate in this gem.\n\nThe mayor of a technologically advanced steam punk town has been kidnapped, and it’s up to the player to figure out who is behind the plot and rescue the beleaguered leader.  There’s a bit more to the story with some twists and turns to the plot, but the premise itself merely plays second fiddle to the exploration and puzzles.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=552606426\nThe first thing that impressed me upon starting the game was how similar it plays to the Drawn series of games.  For those who are unfamiliar, they feature minimal story which serves as just enough premise for pretty hand-painted artwork and challenging puzzles.  And the puzzles are indeed challenging, assuming you’re courageous enough to play on Detective difficulty.  There is no hand-holding here; players will come across clues during exploration, though it takes a bit of critical thinking to apply them to the puzzles.  Even the descriptions are rather vague, often giving just enough detail to get you started, but little more.  If you find yourself sufficiently stumped, skipping is an option; however the timer is quite long.  I’d suggest sticking with it, as the feeling of achievement after figuring out that particularly puzzling enigma is reward in of itself.\n\nAlthough the game has some mild HOG-elements, there are no traditional hidden object scenes.  You’re tasked with searching for a number of hard-to-see puzzle items as you progress through the game areas.  This may be disappointing for those who enjoy the standard HOG gameplay, but make no mistake, the items are difficult to locate and may require a bit of clicking around to find.  There’s no skipping the search either, as you’ll need them to complete puzzles which you simply cannot initiate without. This blending of adventure and hidden object play works incredibly well, however.\n\nPresentation is very important in any game, and Big Secret does not disappoint.  The artwork is lovely, with creatively drawn settings that have a storybook-like essence to them.  The music is also pleasantly high quality featuring interesting and atmospheric selections that accentuate the adventure elements quite well.  My only disappointment is that the mouse-over text fades entirely too quickly.  As a slow reader, I often have to hover over items 2-3 times to fully read the descriptions.  There are also in-game achievements that would have greatly benefited from Steam integration.  I realize doing so may be difficult for older games, but this was only released earlier this year.  Perhaps it’s something we can look forward to having added in the future?\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxnT0mdZDLU\nAll said, I really enjoyed my time with this little title. It's nice to see another developer trying its hand at the formula that Big Fish perfected with its Drawn games.  I’d certainly love to see more like it, especially ones with puzzles that do not belittle the player’s intelligence.  And with the seamless blending of adventure and hidden object play bringing in both types of players, it’s definitely worth a look for the price.\n\nBottom Line: Recommended for both adventure and hidden object fans looking for something a bit more challenging than your standard HOPA fare.\n\nNote - This game was provided by the publisher with the request to write an informative review.","November 13, 2015","true","9.2"," 79 of 79 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","79","79","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/el_kemosabe/recommended/409090/","el_kemosabe","El Kemosabe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/el_kemosabe/","1115 products in account","Introduction\nThe Big Secret of a Small Town is a hidden object puzzle game developed by Flenx and published by Buka Entertainment. The mayor of the small town you find yourself in has been kidnapped while giving a speech to the people of the town and it’s your job to find out where’s he’s been taken and who has taken him. As you travel through the town and surrounding area you’ll find yourself facing several puzzles which have to be completed for you to progress.\n\nPresentation\nBig Secret’s presentation is a real mixed bag. The hand-drawn style of the game is nice and fits well with the game itself (the screenshots on the store page looks considerably worse than it looks in-game so don’t judge it based on the screenshots). The problem is that the game doesn’t offer HD resolutions, meaning if you’re playing on a monitor/laptop which is natively HD the game is going isn’t going to look great despite the nice art style. As for objects in the game and such they look pretty nice but again the resolution does lower their quality.\n\nGameplay\nBig Secret’s gameplay is just a mash up between your standard puzzle game and your standard HOG (Hidden Object Game), with more of a focus on the HOG side of things. You’ll spend most of your time in the game looking for objects which will either have a basic use to help you progress or will be used in one of the game’s puzzles. The HOG side of things isn’t overly difficult for the most part though it may sometimes take you a while to find objects, really that just depends on how good you are at HOG games.\n\nThe puzzles are more challenging in comparison right from the first one onwards. There is a lot of variation between the puzzles and none of them are similar to each other, making each one interesting. Generally there are two or three little puzzles in each section of the game and one more substantial puzzle. I would give examples of the puzzles but since they’re one of the main offerings of the game I won’t in order to avoid spoiling it for any prospective players.\n\nThroughout the game you have a hint system as well as the option to skip puzzles at your disposal. The hint system offers you hints (well duh) which usually help you find an object that you need to progress or if you’ve found all of the objects in an area you’ll be given a hint on how to use said objects. Once you’ve received a hint there’s a cooldown before you can request another one, the length of this cooldown depends on which of the two difficulties you select when you start the game. The option to skip puzzles is only available to you when you encounter those more substantial puzzles that I mentioned earlier. The skip isn’t available straight away though so you are forced to at least have a go but after around twenty seconds the option does become available to you (not a huge time to wait if you simply can’t be bothered to do the puzzle). While neither of these have a particularly negative impact on your experience with the game if you use them sparingly, using them regularly will effectively remove the gameplay from Big Secret entirely as there’s nothing to the game, gameplay-wise, other than the puzzles and object finding.\n\nAudio\nBoth the voice acting and the soundtrack of the game are really good. The music that plays on the main menu is particularly good/fitting but I couldn’t find any faults throughout the game when it came to the music. The sound effects were about average, they got the job done but they weren’t worth writing home about.\n\nMiscellaneous The only graphical option the game offers is a fullscreen toggle, nothing else. There are two audio sliders and a Custom Cursor toggle but that’s it in the way of options for the game.\nWhile the story of the mayor disappearing is quite intriguing I found the background information on the Town offered through cutscenes in the game to be rather uninteresting and perhaps focused on the wrong things.\nThe game can be completed in around two hours as other reviewers have mentioned but I’d suggest that it’d only be this short for those who are particularly good at hidden object games.\nThe hints offered to you in the game were occasionally unhelpful and were sometimes hints for objects I had already found.\nThe explanations/descriptions for the substantial puzzles are often unclear and unhelpful.\nI was occasionally unclear on what I needed to do to progress in the game without using the hint system.\nVerdict\nWorth Purchasing on Sale.\n\nThe Big Secret of a Small Town is a fun and often challenging HOG puzzle game with some good features from both genres. While it’s let down by its presentation as well as the hint system at times, any fans of HOG games will probably enjoy the game though perhaps not at full price.\n\nReview Copy Provided.\n\nNo drama, Just Reviews.\n\nEl K.","November 6, 2015","true","5.8"," 40 of 49 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","40","49","2","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BirdCute/recommended/409090/","BirdCute","BirdCute","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BirdCute/","1507 products in account","The Big Secret of a Small Town is a cute little puzzle game that has great potential, but fails at some of the most important aspects of the gameplay.\nIf this review is too long for you, I suggest you to only read the first paragraph about the game's content and the final verdict at the end.\n\nWhat is happening in the game:There is a small town, where the mayor suddenly disappears. You also have to find where the town gets all its electricity and catch the villain.\n\nPros:    The Story and Voice Acting | I gotta say, the story in this game is quite good. Every once in a while, you will encounter a cutscene about what happened with the city. These cutscenes are nicely animated and voice acted, which is, hand on heart, the best thing in this game.\nThe Puzzles | Puzzles in this game are quite enjoyable, but they can also be extremely difficult. Quite a few times, I had to brute force the solution as the game was at some points very unhelpful when it came to puzzle solving. But I still enjoyed the whole thing a lot.\nItem Handling | As in most games of this genre, you have an inventory to store your items. I have to say that you never have so many items that it confuses you (which happens in some games) and all of the items usually make sense and it's clear what you have to do with them.\nHand-Drawn Environment | This game looks awesome, as everything is hand-drawn. You probably noticed from the screenshots that the whole look of the game is nice, moving elements are animated perfectly as well. I have to mention one problem with the graphics, however, which you will find under Cons.\nCons:    Incredibly Hard / Impossible Ending | In the end of the game, there is a puzzle in which you have to hit a villain with an electrical beam while he's trying to avoid you. The rules are perfectly clear and it's even pretty simple to figure out what is the winning move, but he just won't move to that position. If he does, the player is usually too far from the villain to win. Some people managed to do it somehow (that say it was pure luck) but I couldn't do it in 30+ min. This shouldn't be a thing in a video game.\nResolution Problems | The resolution is locked at 1024x768, so be prepared for temporary disturbances when Steam notifications cover a quarter of your screen.\nOS Compatibility and Steam Integration | As you can probably assume this game only supports Windows. Also, there are no Achievements because the dev refuses to implement them. I don't know what is the point of this, there is probably none. Also, no Cloud support. Get ready for a full data wipe every time you delete the game.\nHint System | So, there is a rechargeable hint button that helps you when you get stuck. It's a nice addition since some puzzles are insanely hard, but sometimes, the hint button doesn't help you at all, which is why I used bruteforcing on some occasions. The hints are suffering mostly from being too general and sometimes even from including a bit too advanced English words.\nThe final verdict:It was hard to decide how to rate this game and I wish (as you can also see in some other reviews) that there would be a Meh option. There isn't one, so I decided to leave this game a positive review, as playing this game was certainly a great experience and I want this developer this game to keep making games.\nHowever, this game still has some major problems that should not be in a released game. The puzzle in the end is next to impossible and only solvable with a big amount of luck. Other than that, the game was mostly enjoyable, despite hard puzzles and useless hints.\n\nGreetings,\nBirdCute\n\nNote that my copy of this game was obtained for free for reviewing purposes. However, this did not affect the quality and objectivity of this review.\n---\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","November 15, 2015","true","5.1"," 20 of 25 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","20","25","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Atarikid/recommended/409090/","Atarikid","Atari","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Atarikid/","341 products in account","TL:DR - Fun adventure, puzzle, hidden object game.\n\nThe first thing that struck when when I loaded this game was how much I liked the music and graphics.  My first thought on the graphics where that they were in the style of Steampunk, but upon further reflection, the graphics are more closely related to scenes from DaVinci's workbook.  The voice acting is during cutscenes is, thankfully, very well done.  The cutscenes themselves are pretty fun to watch.  Without getting into spoilers, it is quite fun watching the story unfold throughout the game.\n\nThis is at its core a puzzle game - similiar in style (but not setting!) to games such as Shadowgate or Kings Quest.  This genre of game will succeed or fail, in my opinion, on the quality of the puzzles.  You wander from room to room picking up items, fitting them together and solving puzzles.  Luckily, the puzzles are logical unlike some other games (I haven't run across any "microwave the hamster" puzzles or nonsense like that).  The puzzles from the items you pick up make sense:  sweep up the sand, light the lamp, follow the recipe.\n\nEvery now and then another puzzle opens:  such as fighting blocks into a shape or figuring out a code.  These are all very well done.\n\nOverall, the game is pretty great.\n\nI'll update this review as I get further into the game.\n\n**Steam Key provided by developer**","October 22, 2015","true","6.9"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","12","15","0","0"

You are a detective, and one day the Mayor is kidnapped from the stage and a scarecrow with a bloody knife in it’s chest is left in his place. It’s your job to track down the Mayor and save the day!\n\nAs you progress, you’ll piece together and solve puzzles that will show you short clips in order to learn the huge secret that the interesting little town that you started off in is hiding. The storyline is very sweet and not too complicated while at the same time being very original. You’ll meet cute steampunk characters, play chess, solve maths problems, juggle chemicals and encourage a love story (and even deliver the ring!).\n\nThe gameplay itself is nothing new, but that doesn’t mean there’s anything wrong with it. The game itself lasts for two to three hours, maximum, perfect for someone busy and interested in a short and cute story or for kids who love puzzles. To find what you need to complete each puzzle, you’ll need to thoroughly search each room you’re in. While it’s hard to find some pieces as they’re very well hidden and can be quite small, it certainly creates an aura of challenge. Most of the puzzles are classics that everyone should be able to complete, though whether they take you five minutes or forty-five is up to you and your brain. The game itself has 15 achievements for you to complete, although they’re not steam achievements.\n\nThe artstyle is very colourful, attractive and kid friendly. Once you complete the game, extra behind the scenes images have been unlocked for you to enjoy and further explain why each puzzle occurred. For example, one image shows the villain shooting at the Mayor, missing, and hitting a steam pipe. Later on in the game, you must block the steam coming from that pipe in order to progress. This is a really clever way of adding extra content into your game while tying it all together, and I really enjoyed it.\n\nThe Big Secret of a Small Town also has a very catchy soundtrack. It has beautiful string pieces and orchestral pieces strewn throughout the game to really help showcase the mood and storytelling. I’d honestly recommend this game for that alone.\n\nFinally, the technical aspect of the game. It has two separate sliders for the music and the sound effects. The game has an option to be windowed or fullscreen, however you don’t seem to be able to choose the size of the game when it’s windowed. You also have an option to use custom cursors. Last but not least, you and your family can play this game without having to worry about saving over each other’s progress, as this game allows you to play with several profiles.\n\nOverall, I absolutely recommend The Big Secret of a Small Town to everyone from the ages of 10 and up. This is a wonderful gem in anyone’s steam library and I’d definitely recommend that you give it a go.\n\nIf you'd like to read more reviews from me, join my steam group!","October 22, 2015","true","8.9"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","12","18","2","0"

Brain teasers are puzzles that look immensely complicated but in reality have remarkably simple solutions.  Think Medusa's Knot.  Or the old logic brain teaser of how to get an object from the center of a rug without stepping on the rug.\n\nStoryline:  The Mayor of the Small Town has been kidnapped.  It is your job (as a detective) to find him and bring him back.  Simple enough.  (The opening sequence is actually narrated by the villian and the only one who speaks in the entire game.) Oh yes and while looking for the mayor and chasing after the villian, one learns the secret of the small town.\n\nGameplay: Simple point and click game focused on the brain teaser and puzzle elements.  A note about the point and click find items and inventory.  The find items in many cases are small or very small so search carefully when looking for things like buttons or puzzle pieces.  Some are found in odd places like a footprint or in the smaller puzzle boxes. (HINT: If a box opens, such as the alchemy puzzle, and remains able to be opened the player is missing something in the box.  The smaller boxes close permenantly when everything in that box is found and finished.)  The inventory exists simply to hold items long enough to collect all the pieces for the puzzle presently being worked on.  It is a collect and use in that area inventory.  There are no hold over items from area to area.  There are 8 areas total the detective traverses through each with a main puzzle to solve before the player can move on.  Once an area is completed the player can not go back and the play is limited in scope to just a few places so no map is needed.  Advice: Look closely at everything and do not ignore anything hanging.  Clues and directions are found in these places.\n\nNow about the puzzles: They range in difficulty from easy to extremely hard (and patience testing in a case or two.)  Fortunately, there is a no penalty skip button for when the player gets frustrated or simply does not want to be bothered.  All the puzzles are logic based, the more obscure ones get dialogue with highlighted words to give the players clues about what to do, and most are actually brain teasers.  Plus if the player looks at all the little drawings and posters everywhere, these drawings are clues (One poster is even labelled CLUE) if not the actual solution to the puzzle. (The tangram puzzle comes to mind in that regard.  The solution is actually shown on a piece of paper.)  There are clues everywhere to finding the solutions to the puzzles.  Again search an area carefully for all items and all those little places that are hiding items.\n\nPuzzles include sliders, assembly, straight logic, rotaters, and mazes? (that is all I can think of to call them - those puzzles a player needs to connect something from point A to point B).\n\nFor those who want an extra challenge (and to complete an in-game achievement or two) look for all the extra cutscenes (usually found on tapestries) and the Flenx logo, a stylized elephant.  (For some reason when the game was translated the stylized elephant logo got called a "bishop".  It evens sounds like an elephant when clicked on. Simply shakes head.)\n\nAnd lastly some words about the end game.  It is a puzzle like all the others but with no skip option.  The point is to zap the villian with an electrical charge.  (He deserves it since he nearly kills the player earlier in the game.)  Now there is a trick to this puzzle or the player will be endlessly chasing the villian about.  (Many reviews state this chasing as a frustration and there are discussions about how to catch him.)  I will tell you, the reader/player, this since the hint button does not do more then point out the "trick" area without explanation.  Plus the villian can be defeated in 15 moves, so the achievement claims.  The trick is a DIAGONAL move which can only occur between the two blue squares in the bottom right corner of the floor.  This changes the rhythmn from one of simply following to one of actively pursuing.  (In other words, from being a move behind to being a move ahead.)  Good luck with catching villian, remember it is still a logic puzzle.\n\nOverall, I recommend this game.  A well thought puzzle, brain teaser, logic game that makes one think but not so hard that it makes one mad or frustrated playing.  It leaves the player with a satisfied feeling and for me, after chasing that villian for far longer then I care to admit, I actually cheered when I caught him.  (Of course, that was after discovering the "trick".)","April 24","true","11.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

You find objects that you need to continue on to the next area.  You will need to do a lot of back tracking and searching around carefully.  I would recommend playing this on the easy mode, at least at first, so you can get a handle on how the game play works.  Hints will tell you what you need to look for next or how certain items interact.\n\nYou will also periodically come across puzzles.  These puzzles can involve placing a pattern in the right order, matching symbols, etc...  Some of these are easy and some of them are not.  Luckily you can skip these puzzles if they are too hard for you.\n\nStory has some interesting points and seems to have a solid lore.  Graphics for videos are well done.\n\nThis type of game is not for everyone.  If you like point and click games, like crime solving games, or like visual novels you may like this game.  And in terms of the quality of the game I can give it a thumbs up.\n","October 22, 2015","true","1.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

This game is not so much a hidden object game as it is a puzzle type scavenger hunt that requires you to find items and piece them together to solve problems. It took me by surprise actually as I weekly search for hidden object games on Steam and when this popped up I bought it thinking that is what it was.\n\nI am not disappointed however as the story is good but it does lack some things. The hints button is not that helpful and sometimes you can miss items due to them being so small you pass by them. And if you need to skip a puzzle the loading time for skipping it really drags out.\n\nSo it's a good game but not a great game. And don't buy it thinking its a HOG like I did.","October 24, 2015","true","2.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Not really. It's a point and click puzzle game. Does it have a great story? It's...different, sure, told through cutscenes narrated by the villain. But nothing fantastic. Is it entertaining? I thought so.\n\nA lot of reviewers compared this to a "hidden object game" but I don't really see it that way. Sure, there are hidden objects that you have to find, but that's where the similarity ends. You don't have a list of items in a scene straight out of that show Hoarders. You're a detective looking for clues, so you pick up objects that seem to be interesting to the case, or that are necessary to the challenge at hand. There is a BIT of randomness to the stuff you pick up at times, but everything fits with solving the obstacle, not "Find 2 chickens, 1 red ball and a tire iron." Then, after you find things, you can combine the items you find with whatever they go with (e.g. put the brass key into the brass lock) and there's usually some sort of mind-teaser type puzzle. (e.g. Move these colored pieces onto their matching colored pegs, or connect all these railroad tracks from the start to the finish.) These mind-teasers range from the obvious, to the "I know what to do but executing it is hard" to the "How in the world do you do this?" Fortunately, there are hints available when you're stuck on the level itself, and the possibility to skip a mind-teaser after an obligatory waiting period.\n\nThere's also different difficulties, but all this seems to change is the timeout function of the hint system, so playing on easy is no different than on hard except in the time you have to wait when you've finally given up. Unfortunately, there's only one hint given when you're stuck in an area, and it doesn't always pertain to the thing you're working on at the moment. (e.g. You want to fix the elevator, but it gives you advice on the chemistry set, which you already knew about but hadn't gotten around to doing yet, so now you have to do the chemistry puzzle and wait for your hint clock to reset so you can get that hint about the elevator.) Usually, this helps, if you have to unlock one puzzle before unlocking another one, but it's not always linear, so it's a minor annoyance.\n\nIf you're into hardcore puzzles, this might not be for you. But if you like hidden object games (keeping in mind what I already said about the comparison being iffy) or point-and-click adventures, you might want to give this a try. But it's not worth it at full price. At the $2 I paid for it, certainly.\n\nOverall: 7/10. Nothing amazing, but entertaining.","February 22","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Some were truly enjoyable. The Last "puzzle" if you can call it a puzzle was a deal killer for me.  I realized at this point that the developers ran out of ideas and decided that punishing you for purchasing the game was a good idea.  I like logic not random events when trying to solve. I stopped it there and moved on. Decent game overall but that  killed it for me .  I can't  recommend a game that tries to hard to prove that it is challenging by resorting to monotous, random, time consuming, illogical problem solving.  Too bad since for the most part it was decent.","February 18","false","25.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Yes, it has flaws, such as a heavy reliance of random chance in the puzzles you solve, but I've played worse hidden object games on steam (Demon Hunter comes to mind). Despite that, I haven't gotten around to playing the game to completion, although that might be best put off until some time later, as I have yet to see if full Windows 10 support will be coming to the game or not (At least, if what one of the three negative reviews for this game I read is accurate).\n\nFor consistency's sake, here's the original review that I made in March 2015 (Fair warning, though, the original review is sh-it. Man, that feels more meaningful than reminiscentily commenting about my old laptop):\n\nBefore reading, please note: I was provided a steam key by the dev for review purposes.\nAs I get further into this game, I might or might not update this review. For now, in this First Impressions review, I'll recount what I've seen and experienced of the game thus far, since I sadly suck at reviews.\n\nAs I boot up The Big Secret of a Small Town, I find that it runs great on the crappy toaster that I call my laptop, and that I can't get over how nice the game looks, especially since its set in a steampunk setting. Since I knew I couldn't gawk at the title screen, though, I started a new game and began the campaign. Because I skipped the intro cutscene (Not a flaw in the game, just a flaw in how impatient I am), all I know about the premise of the game itself is that the mayor's been kidnapped, and you gotta find out whodunnit. While some games don't do whodunnit storylines well in the sense that you can guess who the villian is before the game tells you (Looking at you, Artifex Mundi), I hadn't met any other characters in the game at that point beyond the sheriff who was investigating the crime scene and the main protagonist, therefore making the mystery impossible to predict until the game reveals it to you. I would later see that this game had great voice acting and music, which was something I missed out on during my first blind playthrough simply because I often play music on my phone. As I reach the first puzzle in the game, I realize that I suck horrible at hidden object games, having relied on walkthroughs for previous hidden object games I had played before playing this game. I stopped playing for the day when I reached the clock tower in the game, but I like this game enough to continue playing it.\n\nTl:DR Great Hidden Object Game with a mystery you can solve, only wished that the in-game achievements that I found by exploring the extras menu were counted as steam achievements. Well worth the $6.99 price tag!","May 12","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
