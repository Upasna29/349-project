If you celebrate Christmas or are just familiar with the usual festivities then you’ll understand this game right away. It has all the things the holiday has; snow, candy, gifts, cooking and baking, helping out others and of course adorable little old ladies. This game is as if Kris Kringle himself sat down and decided to develop a causal game. If you’re a scrooge then bah humbug to you, try Christmas Adventure: Candy Storm anyway!\n\nThe story is very simple, you’re dashing through the snow  in your red pickup truck loaded with presents when all of a sudden you’re hit with a magical wave of energy. Your car has been turned into candy and you’ve landed in what seems to be a festive holiday land! My first instinct was to eat my new diabetes-mobile but your character seeks help in restoring it to its metal form. It seems these three nice old ladies that live in a gingerbread house made a mistake with their spell and now need your help to reverse it, while they also need help with other mundane tasks. At one point I was getting suspicious that they actually stopped me on purpose to have someone help do things they couldn’t do since they’re old. However, they are very nice and they help you get back on the road again. The game’s store front page says you’re playing as Santa’s Granddaughter, Lisa, but this is never mentioned in-game, which was a missed opportunity on the part of the developers.\n\nYou use your mouse to play the game, clicking on things and people to interact with them. You also collect useful items that will need to progress through certain obstacles along the way. The main aspect of the game are hidden item scenes. You’re given a list of items to find and a chaotic scene of Christmas fun to sift through, in the end finding the one actual item that you needed. There are also puzzles as well but there are not many and most are rather easy. You will mainly be helping the old ladies out and doing quite a few hidden-item scenes in this game which I really liked.\n\nThe graphics are straight out of a Christmas card. Everything Christmasy can be found here, trees and candy canes, angels and bells, so it’s over-the-top festive. The game is very beautiful and full of color, the visuals put an instant smile on my face when I opened up the program. There are beautiful holiday lights, garland, twinkling stars and so much more everywhere. To go with the theme, the music is also holiday inspired some tunes even being old classics you may recognize. There is no voice acting at all, however.\n\nI played this game in April but it felt like mid-December the whole time. This is a bare bones hidden object game, the plot is simple with no twists or turns and the gameplay is traditional. The game is also a bit short, I completed it within three hours. Also, I noticed a few spelling and grammatical errors in the text. However, the game is also only two dollars and has trading cards on Steam so it’s a good value for what you’re given. Christmas Adventure: Candy Storm is a fun treat any time of the year and I fully recommend it.\n\nFor more recommendations and reviews on our favorite up and coming quality games follow Lot's O Giveaway's group curations here!","April 7","true","11.5"," 24 of 26 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","24","26","0","0"

This was a very fun game and the challenges were a good level of difficulty. Not too easy, nor are they maddeningly insane.\n\nThe music, artwork and atmosphere are excellent and I would definitely recommend this game to those who enjoy this style of computer game as well as those who may like challenges, puzzles and of course an old fashioned Christmas or holiday setting. You won't be disappointed!\n\nOne last bit to mention... This game is NOT too long, nor too short. I feel it had just about the right amount of things to do within a decent amount of time. As of now I have 3.7 hours in the game, but that isn't 100% accurate as I was playing on my laptop got about 1/3 of the way through, then decided to play on my desktop PC instead. Sadly, the game doesn't appear to have cloud save capability so when I started on my desktop, I had to start from the beginning which I didn't mind much anyway.\n\nI hope this group releases more games like this. Perhaps based around other holidays like New Years, Easter, Halloween, Thanksgiving, etc...

The music and the holiday feel of it is just wonderful! The challenges are not too easy nor they are absurdly hard. And whenever you get stuck and just can't figure out what to do next, a helpful little snowman provides you with hints at any time! The artwork is incredible too! I found myself smiling through the entire gameplay! I was oddly disappointed when I was done with the game and then it hit me that it's not really Christmas time! I loved the entire experience, from having my room filled with lovely holiday music to admiring the adorable Christmas art. It's by no means an epic game, but I can honestly say it's everything I ever wanted from a Christmas hidden object game!\n\nPros:-Really brings out your Christmas spirit\n-Wonderful music\n-Beautiful classic artwork\n-Fun puzzles\n-Hints available if needed\n-Cute Badges (Christmas ornaments!)\n\nCons:-No Steam Achievements (developers have said they plan to have it added by Christmas!)\n-Some grammar/spelling mistakes (might make it a little harder to find certain objects due to misspelling/mistranslated words, but nothing extreme enough that will hinder your enjoyment though!)\n\n10/10 Why isn't it Christmas already?!","April 6","true","4.5"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","9","9","2","0"

However, you arrive in front of an house, belonging to three old sisters. They apparently messed up and want to help you. However, first, you'll have to help them...\n\nThis is a short adventure game. The story is just "help the sisters for tasks like finding what to make clothes for birds and you'll be on the road again". There is no evil plot, no hidden secret, nothing. In other words, Christmas Adventure's story is just inexistent.\n\nThe gameplay isn't innovative as all, as it's find items, use them, clear hidden objects scenes and solve some puzzles. But there is a little problem with the gameplay. Actions to make aren't always making sense, some new areas are appearing out of the blue and I often existed the hidden objects scenes because while trying to click on an object, I was in reality in the exit area. Besides, you have just 4 locations: the three rooms where the sisters are and outside. You don't visit anything else.\n\nThe graphics are acceptable, they're fitting to the Christmas ambiance. The soundtrack is also reflecting this.\n\nI should have known that for the price, I wasn't getting a great hidden object game. True, it's well polished. But when you're used to play longer games, you're kinda deceived. However, I would have probably given a thumb up if actions were making sense and if I was seeing more than four locations. However, I was disappointed in the end. I didn't really enjoy the game - and trust me, it's pretty rare when I'm thumbing down a casual game.","May 31","false","1.8"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","10","11","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/joecool4279/recommended/456430/","joecool4279","JoeCool","http://steamcommunity.com/id/joecool4279/","4975 products in account","I purchased this game because it was inexpensive and because it had a Christmas theme. While some of the objects were holiday-related, there wasn't really a holidy feel to this game at all.\n\nIt's a very short game at about 2 hours at most to complete. There are only 4 locations. Each one is fairly loaded with puzzles though. Some of the logic on where to put what items you find seemed off at times.\n\nThe story seemed very arbitrary, help a few women do some random stuff in exchange for a magical cure to fix your car.\n\nThere is either no music, or a single track from the Nutcracker on loop (that I can recall hearing). I don't remember much in audio in general.\n\nI found a single typo. Once asked to find a "dool" when it meant "doll."\n\nIt wasn't always easy to discern what all the objects were in each puzzle, but as a test, I started selecting items from the screen that somehow stood out from the base image and was able to find most of them without even reading the item list. So it's pretty obvious what the target items are. When you revisit a hidden object location, it's extra easy to find objects, because they are all new objects that weren't there the last time.\n\nThe hint tips are useful and there wasn't any limit on using them. However, it didn't always direct me to move to a different location when needed. If it didn't point to anything, I knew to visit the other three areas.\n\nIt's okay for $1.39 (the sale price I paid). I finished it. There are better games of this genre out there though.","May 1","false","3.2"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"
