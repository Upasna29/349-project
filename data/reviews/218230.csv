"http://steamcommunity.com/id/basicallyakoo/recommended/218230/","basicallyakoo","Akoo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/basicallyakoo/","30 products in account","(Pre-Construction Update)\n\nWar in PlanetSide 2 isn't exactly hell, though your very first experience of it might be. You create your sexy character and pick a neat faction. Then you're unceremoniously dropped, literally from space, right into the biggest battle the game can find, surrounded by enemies and tanks and pew pews and anything else that happens to be around, with a life expectancy measured in milliseconds.\n\nSomehow beat the odds and things don't get better. You stagger from death upon death in a haze of confusion and unexplained icons, not as some ultimate soldier, but simply one more fleck of a gristle in a planet-sized meat grinder that never-ever stops churning. At some point in time, you will even be run over by a tank.. probably driven by someone on your team.. named Kevin.. *scoff*\n\nIt's nothing personal, though. PlanetSide 2 is far too busy for that. In most shooters, 16 players counts as a party. More advanced ones might push the limit to 32, or 64. In Sony's epic F2P, you're dealing with at the most 2000 players per continent! Thankfully not all on screen at once, but locked in a three-way tug of war that doesn't simply take cues from the likes of Call of Duty and Battlefield, but has a pretty damn good way of stealing their thunder. Those games ultimately win out in terms of feel, but PlanetSide 2, even though being comparable is a stunning achievement when compared to the standards of your average action MMO, is easily one of the most ambitious online games ever - and setting aside some launch issues, one that lives up to its impossible promises.\n\nFighting in an open world does feels strange - not as intimidating as you'd expect, but far more than just a salesman gimmick. For the most part, standard first-person shooter rules apply. Shooting is skill-based rather than reliant on arbitrary levels. If you don't want to be shot, you get behind cover. Returning fire can be done easily from hip-fire, but you generally want to take advantage of weapon sights and sniper scopes to deal out more accurate shots and hit distant enemies. It's the basic rules of a shooter. The twist here is that, instead of existing as isolated maps, battlegrounds emerge organically as boundaries shift. Today, that bridge over a canyon is simply a handy route between outposts. Tomorrow, it might be a vast ocean of tanks, with infantry crawling all over the scenery like ants. Being in an open world, anyone who wants to take part can do exactly that. There is a loading screen, but no queues, no arbitrary restrictions on numbers or how much you're allowed to bring into battle - not overt ones, anyway.. An Instant Action button will spirit over anyone who requests a teleport, but you can just as easily spot something happening and head over under your own will.\nThe longer fights go on, the more people will be drawn to them. Sunderers are brought in as mobile respawn points, fighters strafe the ground and battle for air superiority, tanks take up positions and all hell breaks loose until one side seizes victory. If you're outnumbered, too bad. Reinforcements may arrive, or not. War isn't always played fair man.\n\nThe sheer scale of the battles is stunning - to the point that, while it makes sense for PlanetSide to be a F2P game, it takes longer for that to fully sink in. Sony hasn't so much embraced the model as given it a back-breaking bear-hug, almost to the point of creating a hidden mini-game called "What's the Catch?" Without paying a single penny, you get *shocker* all five soldier classes and access to mech suits, full access to all continents, all of the vehicles, no equipment restrictions, as many pew pews as you want and the ability to join and start your own guilds (Outfits). Never are you made to feel like less of a player for not paying a subscription fee or for earning any equipment you need by saving up in-game currency. It's a similar system to League of Legends and Tribes Ascend, only on an MMO scale and with less in the way of *sadly* boobs/jetpacks. ;(\n\nThe most important purchases are, as ever, boosts that speed up your team's in-game resource generation and cooler-looking guns which are used to shoot people in the head for the crime of wearing the wrong colour armour in a shnazzy style. These are slightly expensive tho, with newer guns costing around Â£4/$5 each (500-700 Sony Points I think on PS4).\nYour starting load-out IS respectable though - and while I'm sure it's not deliberate, any temptation to spend a fortune in the store is swiftly dampened by most of its gear being bland variations on stock themes like 'AR' and 'Pistol'. There's nothing as iconic as the Tribes spinfusor, and nothing particularly sexy if you're not into efficiency. In a nice touch, you're allowed to borrow any weapon for a half-hour field+ test before investing your cash/points (which is neat!)\nIn a straight fight between two players of equal skill and time played, it's true that the one who's paid will usually come out on top - if only because upgrades can only be bought with in-game credits, and outright buying a gun leaves many more of them to spend there. The sheer scale of PlanetSide 2's battles does a lot to prevent any slide into "P2W territory" though. Whatever your gear and however many upgrades you have, you're only one soldier in a rock-paper-scissors showdown - where paper and scissors are represented by the sniper over on that hill and his tank friend.\n\n\nAnywho, whatever role you're playing, the action is very solid, and made a little stop-start by the way PlanetSide 2's body armour usually makes tissue paper look like a trimmed mithril armor set selling for 40k dipped in adamantium, but more than adequate. Its only significant failings are in accessibility and readability. There's a basic tutorial, a UI that comes across as a mess of unlabelled icons, blinking lights and labels apparently harbouring an active grudge against the colorblind. It's a staggeringly bad new player experience for a game that does have a tricky learning curve, but whose raw basics really aren't that complicated. The developers explained that ;(\n\nOh, similar confusion also sneaks into the graphics. Textures are busy, which combined with the oddly muted faction colours can make it hard to spot enemies at even close-range, or to react fast enough to anything. The Vanu are particular offenders here, with their purple colours blending into much of the scenery, though the Terran Republic's combination of powerful red with murky grey comes a close second. (If you play Terran, they also earn bonus confusion points for internally using red to flag up enemies. Cognitive dissonance can kill!) I'd like to have seen PlanetSide 2 take a few more cues from the likes of Tribes Ascend and even Team Fortress 2 in terms of its general readability, colour choice and silhouettes. Back to war itself. Out in the field, combat unsurprisingly varies dramatically depending on your class - which you can change at will. Either at reload stations or between lives, if you get bored or your team needs something, be it. A Heavy Assault soldier's life is one of explosives and endless streams of hot lead. Infiltrators work under shadows and use sniper rifles. Light Assault troopers bop around on jetpacks going pew pew. The more points you put into a class and its gear, the more efficient you get with it, so it pays to focus. Do it for the pew pews man.\n\nLone wolf players are likely out of luck, well, not entirely. It's possible to play solo. You can join groups as you travel, be added to squads at the touch of a key, and contribute to raids and defence along with everyone else. PlanetSide 2's epic-scale battles put tight limitations on what any individual can accomplish though, and being a cog in a silent machine is rarely a rewarding career. To make the most of PlanetSide 2, you really have to gather some friends over voice-chat and set your own goals on the vast battlefield. Good luck~","October 12, 2014","true","38.7"," 1,997 of 2,099 people (95%) found this review helpful 218 people found this review funny","95","997","2","218","57"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/banhat/recommended/218230/","banhat","[EcG] Banhat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/banhat/","345 products in account","EDIT: Construction update is out now, if you've ever wanted to try this game out for the first time, or ever thought about trying it out again after burning out, NOW IS THE TIME TO PICK IT UP. Granted, It's a brand new system so it's a bit janky, but there's already been a huge influx of people so the fights have been amazing. I would put more into this review here, but Joshino has just made a great video that explains the new situation better than I can. TL:DR is this: If you've ever wanted to try out the game, now is the time.\n\n\nRecently got back into playing this game, and have been having a blast. Here's some things I've noticed:\n\n* The new tutorial continent is exactly what they needed for the game, it's a small scale version of the actual continents that mostly keeps the newer players "safe" from veterans, excluding Smurfs, since you must be under BR15 to be able to spawn there. It's still not a full tutorial, but at least it's a controlled environment to learn the ropes.\n* The cert grind is also much easier than before, with ribbon bonuses (first 5 of which are doubled), weapon medals, directives etc.\n* Alerts are no longer the deciding factor for locking a continent with the new Victory Point system. Never did like basically getting the boot every time an alert ended, whether you won or not.\n\nWhen it comes to FPS, nothing comes even close to what this game comes to offer when it comes to the sheer scale of battles, and the only other thing that I can think of that comes close to the sense of scale that Planetside 2 offers would be Guild Wars 2's World V World. It's free to try out, so the only thing you lose is time.\n\nSome tips for new players:\n* Stick to the beginner continent until you hit BR15. You can always leave and come back before then if you want to test the deeper waters, but once you're past that you cannot go back. Take advantage of the smaller scale zones to familiarize yourself with the mechanics before diving headfirst into the zergs.\n* Try out *everything* before you buy it. There are two ways of doing this, VR training and Trials. VR training lets you use any combination of gear and attachments for no cost, but only in VR training (unless you unlock the stuff with certs/DBC while in there) They have target ranges for vehicles, infantry, air, complete with range markings for infantry. Take advantage of this. See how each gun works, how it kicks from recoil, cone of fire, and try out how each attachment effects how it fires. Only problem with VR training is that none of the targets move, they're just static and don't truly show how they work in a real fight. That's why Trials exist, so you can use a weapon, albiet just base without attachments, in a real fight for a few hours before spending those hard earned certs on them.\n* Lastly, Planetside 2 is a game about numbers more than it is a shooter, so go in with friends and find a good outfit. Best way to find an outfit is to join an alert platoon, usually run by an outfit, and essentially trial running them. Most outfits recruit this way, so don't be afraid to ask about them while running with them. You'll find the game much more enjoyable while in an outfit, if only to have people to talk to while running with randoms or while participating in organized operations.\n\nHope this helps at least some people with starting out.","November 2, 2015","true","391.5"," 443 of 460 people (96%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","96","443","460","17","10"

It is free to play, so you should definitely give it a shot. Now here's what you'll need to know:\n\nAre you good at battlefield, call of duty, counterstrike, or other first person shooters? If so, good for you, unfortunately that doesn't neccesarily translate into this game that well. I actually started this game being not very good at any FPS's and have gotten considerably better, to where i can comfortably say i am a decent player in this game. The game is so NOT user friendly, that it's learning curve has been called a "learning cliff" by the game's own producer, David Carey. It is something that is always being worked on however. Now, a little about the actual gameplay\n\nI have never ever played a game that offered me this type, this range, this level of gameplay. You have the option to pick from different classes, and choose different guns for those classes. With some effort, you can be the driver or even pilot of one of many different vehicles in the game. As stated before, the game is free to play, and does a good job of doing so. All of the weapons in the game can be bought with the in game currency you build up as you play. Real money can be used to buy these guns, as well as cosmetics such as helmets for your character or different camo's. I personally feel like there is something for everyone in the game; if you like to snipe, you can snipe! You can jetpack around as a light assault, or go gung-ho as a heavy assault! There are so many different things to do.\n\nThe game takes a decent chunk of time to get into and get better at playing, but in just a few months it became my favorite game. I found a super fun group of people who invited me right in and now i play with as much as i can. There are always periods of time where the game has many (and i mean many) issues that make it difficult to play. And although the community is quick to blame SOE (Sony Online Entertainment) and demand fixes, SOE has truly created a masterpiece with this game. As long as there are servers, as long as i am a gamer, as long as i can, i will continue to play planetside, and would more than reccomend it to anybody reading this review.","October 29, 2014","true","933.8"," 580 of 626 people (93%) found this review helpful 39 people found this review funny","93","580","626","39","5"

Battles are massive, epic, and get the blood pumping like no other FPS I have played before.  The sheer beauty of battle is unmatched by any other shooter I've experienced.  Combat mechanics, customization, and leveling are all done very well, as the advantages they give are not game changing, and they can all be unlocked without purchase.  (Excluding purely cosmetic items, they are for purchase only)  Squad mechanics are extremely deep, and are the most polished I've seen out of any game; it allows for levels of strategy I've never before seen in a shooter, and is all too fun creating a warpath with your buddies.  Planetside 2 used to be extremely unoptimized, and was the bane of all but high end cards; however, thanks to some recent optimizations, I am easily running a solid 60 frames on ultra settings with a single GTX 660.  As for the negatives, this game is very heavily reliant on team work.  If your faction, squad, and individual soldiers are not all on the same page, it can quite easily ruin battles.  My suggestion: form squads with your buddies, whip out your headset, and take command.  Overall, Planetside 2 is quite easily the most polished F2P shooter available on steam, perhaps even surpassing TF2.  If you have a computer that can handle it, definitely give PS2 a shot, it is worth it.","November 25, 2013","true","50.7"," 695 of 805 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","695","805","0","26"

It is set on a world known as Axuraxis and battles are fought across 4 very very large continents. It has three factions, The Terran Republic which is the "Government" for say, loyalists and a professional army. Their guns and technology are all centered on speed over heavy damage and versitility. They possess the fastest Aircraft, Tanks, and guns in the game.\n\nThe Second faction, The New Conglomerate, are a band of Rebels or so called Freedom Fighters. Their theme is that of a rebel band who used to be miners and workers who have repurposed their tools for weapons to fight the power. Their technology is focesed on Defense and Damage. They possess the Hardest hitting weapons and vehicles in the game at the cost of a considerable slower Rate of fire for their weapons and Slow movement for their vehicles  compared to the other 2 factions.\n\nThe Third faction is The Vanu Soveirnty, Like the New conglomerate this faction is also a rebel faction that split off from the Terran republic. However, they do not fight for an idea of "freedom" like the NC does. These rebels have found left over alien technology on Auraxis and have converted them into their own use. They are much like a Cult, trying to spread "Truth and Enlightenment" to the other factions. Their faction is focused on Alien weaponry and Versitility. They do not do  quite as much damage as the NC nor are they as fast as the TR, but for that sacrifice they possess extremely versitile weapons and vehicles. Their Main Battle Tank the "Magrider" is a hover tank with the ability to strafe and scale mountains that the NC and TR's treaded counter parts simply can not do. The weapons they use are unique in how they fire, suffering from very little bullet drop like traditional firearms but as the cost of much more horizontal recoil or "Sway".\n\nThe game is a never ending Ground and Air war that is persistant. Unlike modern Shooters such as Battlefield or Call of Duty, there are no "Levels". It is fought on a gigantic map, the battlefield changing each time you take a base and move to the next. It also offers the feeling of a "real" war. It is commonplace to find battles involving 200 or more people, hordes of infantry advancing across the landscape with Tanks behind them and Aircraft battleing above them.\n\nIt is the only game of its kind to offer this unique experience of being part of a war and it is glorious.\n\nAs for the bad parts of the game, It does unfortunately have a Cash shop and it does allow those who pay real money to unlock new weapons and abilities without earning the XP (or certs as they are called) to get them. However on a game with the scope of battles being on such a massive scale, you do not tend to notice this. There are no weapons that are "overpowered" and ruin the game because you dont want to spend real money. They are all rather suprisingly well balanced, each having their ups and downs.\n\nLuckily as well, unlike most Free to play games with a cash shop, it is very possible to progress and unlock items without spending a literal eternity to do it. Unlike other free to play games as well, it is by far one of the most beautiful and good looking shooters on the market. The Quality of its graphics and engine beg the question "why is this not a 60 dollar game like BF or CoD".\n\nIn all if you are looking to feel like you are part of a real war that actually matters and to experience what no other FPS to date has successfully captured, it is most certainly worth the download, if only to try it. Whether you like to be a shock trooper infantryman, a tanker, a dog fighter or even just a support role such as ferrying troops to the front line in a transport, this game has it for you.\n\nAs Unbiasedly as possible 10/10, may the war never end.","July 15, 2015","true","189.6"," 301 of 328 people (92%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","92","301","328","17","2"

Here you have 500vs500, and such battles are kinda normal. Battle without any rounds, battlescreens, resets. Whole worlds is live and fighting 24h, all day and all night.\n\nAlso this is pure F2P game - everything in the game you can test FOR FREE in Virtual Training mode. Everything, even 90% of premium gear. So, before ingame points transaction or before microtransations you can test everything as long as you want. Cool? Cool!\nHow about pay-to-win or pay-to-play? Planetside 2 is one of most pure F2P shooters. Each weapon bought for $ has the same stats and the same modifications as its free counterpart. Even if you are 5 lvl and fighting in great battles this cool pre-unlocked weapon doesn't make you a god - this weapons ins't killing 50 enemies at once. And has just 50 people is a typical branch of the enemy squad in this game! FIRST SKILL, THAN P2P. Also, you can't buy any character perks for $ - only skill is something that determines whether you are good or noob.\n\nThree fractions. Three huge maps (8x8 km). Near 2000 players per map.

I guess this is what grows me? mom?...no.... After exiting the shielded tube I am now in a room of commotion, 20+ other players are running by in a hurry to go somewhere. I find myself confused and really out of place, like the new guy starting a job and everyone else can't be bothered to explain... sort of a "get out of the way were busy here" vibe. Thats cool, ill just do my own thing!\n\nJournal Entry 2\n\nAfter exploring the first few rooms full of shiny lights and blinking consoles I've decided to head outside the structure. I looked at the doorway leading outside, I can hear horrid amounts of explosions and gunfire and machines moving around. Its quite intimidating... I see 8 troops running out the door into no mans land. I then look to my right hand side to witness a giant walking heavy mech person... my god its beautiful.... the faceplate is painted to look like something out of a Jason murder movie, he has duel Gatling guns on each arm. He stops and looks at me for a second, I suddenly feel like everything might just be alright. He turns and heads out the door.... Now... when I deployed I unknowingly chose a very very violent and war torn section of the map. I walked outside and my Jaw hit the floor in amazement.\n\nJournal Entry 3\n\nUpon leaving the safety of the structure I was now standing on the steel ledge overlooking the most large scale and violent battlefield I've seen in a FPS to date. Above me dozens of ships waged war on each other, firing rockets and lasers through the sky. A larger ship swoops down onto a hill in the back and unloads soldiers.... below me appears to be hundreds of men charging from this structure towards and equally large force of enemies. Dozens of tanks lined up on both fronts exchange fire while smaller armed Suv's and Quads blaze passed each others lines, exploding and fleeing.\n\nJournal Entry 4\n\nOn my level, engineers are desperately repairing turrets and heavy walking mechs. Medics run frantically to revive the downed soldiers that litter the parapets. Mounted machine guns and rocket fire are so frequent that you don't even know who to start shooting at. Standing back from the battle I can only watch in complete amazement at the scale of this battle.\n\nJournal Entry 5\n\nArmed only with my small assault rifle I work up the courage to join the fight. I walk forward on to some type of holographic elevator that takes me straight down to the battle. I look up and can see that there is a large squad of men floating down the elevator behind me. We touch down on the ground and without warning everyone charges forward, I do the same, completely ignoring the tank shells and bullets flying past our heads. Its crowd mentality now, I am no longer thinking for myself I'm just following the flow of this ocean of soldiers.\n\nJournal Entry 6\n\nI can roughly guess that there is about 30 of us in a squad running up this field. The explosions are starting to lower that number significantly as we get closer to the enemy lines. I don't know the men around me but I feel safe knowing that im not alone. The flyers have now focused in on our squad and begin to rain down rockets from the sky, medics are not able to keep up with the casualties anymore, they have to run for their own lives. We finally reach cover behind a large rock, our numbers are now more like 9 or 10 after the charge. We have one heavy mech with 2 engineers constantly repairing him and a couple medics that are keeping everyone alive.\n\nJournal Entry 7\n\nSuddenly 3 guys are dropped from the group, it appears a sniper far off on a hill to the right has flanked our position. We can't run back and we can't run forward, we can only dance around like fish in a barrel dodging a mariners spear. I can hear one of the other guys open mic call out to a friend for support, within seconds 10 tanks roll over the snipers position and we safe once again. We are now down to 6 guys, we are really far from our lines and it doesn't appear that more reinforcements are coming to join us anytime soon.\n\nJournal Entry 8\n\nThe guy with the open mic tells us that we need to try and flank the enemy lines and take out some of their snipers, he says that we are all more then likely going to die but at least we can make a dint. Well... its been a good run, time to go out and make a good last charge.\n\nJournal Entry 9\n\nWe burst from our cover and charge the left side of the hill that is now considered the sniper's line. I'm not in slow motion but if I was I think id be yelling "FREEDOM". We clear the field losing only 1 guy to sniper fire, 5 of us charge the hillside and over the top. We were expecting to see a couple snipers that we could take out easily.... unfortunately there was about 60+ ground troops all crouched behind the hill, I think they were amping up for a big attack. so here is the 5 of us idiots standing at the top of a hill like scarecrows in a parking lot. The 60+ soldiers open fire and within the blink of an eye were all very dead and laying on the hill. Today I learn that being the hero is another mans game, ill stick to hiding in the back with a rocket launcher next time.","June 2, 2014","true","45.0"," 738 of 872 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","738","872","0","16"

Planetside 2 brings unprecedented size of fights to the FPS front, in a format that challenges battlefields joint combat arms set up. You might see hundreds of tanks come over a hill whilst infantry spill through a valley as bombers and fighters weave through flak in the air. Which all happens on a huge continent sized map with no transitional borders. This just isn't possible in any other games to date. But it is not just that Planetside 2 is a one of a kind game that makes it good. The tank gameplay, FPS mechanics and flying are all enjoyable in their own right. And the variation in each loadout can give birth to a wide style of play that can keep you playing for a long time.Oh and did I mention it was free? The weapons are all side grades and almost everything you can buy with money you can also grind as a new player, so forget calling pay to win. It is a little rough around the edges, with patches occasionally breaking the game, but that seems thematic with most â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥mes. But a big plus of being an MMO is the outfits and faction chatter that can also immerse you not just in the battlefield but the community, which other shooters don't have. So if you want to play a game that actually feels like a battlefield, then I would 100% recommend Planetside 2 to you.","January 28","true","759.4"," 170 of 182 people (93%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","93","170","182","3","8"

Pros and cons.\n\nFor a video overview, check this unofficial trailer by Moukass\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5cHAE0eiOE\nHere's a video for new players, courtesy of Wrel\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIu143Si3w\n\n-------------------------------\nPros:\n-------------------------------\n\nâ¦ Unique huge open world experience\nVery hard to find  a game as massive as this. Gargantuan of a world in which every single living being is a human. Heck, even the turrets must be manned if you want them to work.\nOver three continents, each with a player cap of 2000.\nHard to pull off, but they did.\n\nâ¦ Vehicle game\nPlanes are hella fun if you're good. Tanks, buggies and armored are fun too. The vehicles fit well in a world as big as this and they can be specialized for anything.\n\nâ¦ Active dev team\nThe dev team are involved in updates and in the community (which is the whiniest community in decades). They bring out consistent changes, not always imbalanced or bugged.\n\nâ¦ Good graphics and effects\nIt looks good on ultra if you can run it.\n\nâ¦ Good FPS response for a MMO-Shooter\nSurprisingly, shooting works. It works like in any FPS with a max of 30 players, but with 2000 players max. Not as crisp as that, but it works.\n\nâ¦ Great to play in an organised outfit\nThat should be your main priority : Find an outfit (a.k.a. a guild), make friends with them, follow the leaders order if you want to win.\n\nâ¦ Game is fun to play once the battles are evenly matched\n\nâ¦ It's active. It won't die out this decade.\n\n-------------------------------\nCons:\n-------------------------------\n\nCHECK THE COMMENTS FOR CONS SINCE IT SAID:\n"Your recommendation is 789 characters too long. Please shorten it and try again."\n\n\nHighly recommend this game if:\n- you got a good PC &\n- you are a social person &\n- you like FPS's or vehicle play (e.g. flying) &\n- you like fun &\n- you have a big pocket or you don't care about unlockables\n\nIt's a good game. You need to try it definitely, since it's free to play.","July 21, 2013","true","868.9"," 313 of 373 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","313","373","0","19"

Don't believe the lies! More on this below.\n\nPlanetside 2 is unlike any other gaming experience you've ever had.\nThere's a reason why so many people say that Planetside 2 ruined every other online FPS game for them. Nothing comes even close to the scale this game provides and to the many playstyles it has to offer.\nImagine your favourite Battlefield title, only with incomparably larger maps (we call them continents) and up to 1000 players wreaking havoc across them in more ways than you can count.\nYou can try and capture enemy bases in an organized attack with dozens of your friends while preventing the enemies from snatching your own territory in return. You can harvest resources and build outposts. You can even just have some casual fun blowing stuff up. But however you choose to play the game, you will be having the most epic fights of any FPS game out there.\nWhether you want to focus on infantry or vehicular combat, the game has you covered.\nYou can be a dedicated sniper/recon, a medic, an engineer, a sturdy heavy assault or a jetpack-toting light assault that can ignore many obstacles and surprise enemies with their pants down. You can even climb into a MAX, an exo suit designed to absorb lots of damage and break a stalemate. The infantry play greatly rewards skill and accuracy, with a big emphasis on burst firing, headshots, positioning and awareness.\nAre you a tank buff? Look no further: depending on your choice of faction you gain access to 3 unique two-man tanks, each with its own strengths and weaknesses, all featuring projectile drop and giving you much room to grow in skill. A good tank crew can have a massive impact on the battlefield.\nAre you a fan of aircraft? Planetside provides several, from the light empire specific fighters, which work like a cross between a jet and a helicopter, allowing for every manoeuvre you can think of, to the powerful 3-man liberators and larger 6 and 12 man transport ships. Whether you're looking to provide air support to your faction, or simply scour the skies looking for enemy air to engage, you're sure to have fun, epic battles.\nThere are also lighter, one-man tanks, 3-man buggies and an ATV, which can be equipped with an invisibility cloak for surprise attacks and stealthy passage through enemy territory.\nThere is so much depth to this videogame that you can literally play it for thousands of hours without ever getting bored of it, since you can keep rotating through the many different playstyles available in order to keep it fresh. Really, Planetside 2 is like several solid games packaged into one, and all of it FOR FREE.\nThere are some who will argue that the game is P2W but if you pay attention you'll notice that most of them have barely played the game for any substantial length of time. What they are experiencing is simply the learning curve of the game, which is admittedly a bit tough at first, but rather than allowing time for their skill to mature they chalk it up to premium items/features. THIS IS FALSE. The only payed-for exclusives are purely cosmetic. Everything else, you can obtain at a reasonable pace through playing the game. I should know. I never spent any money on it.\n\nDo yourself a favour and try this game out. Have patience, look for tutorials, ask for tips whenever you get the chance. Once you're through the baptism by fire that all of us have gone through you'll start having crazy amounts of fun!","May 10","true","256.9"," 157 of 185 people (85%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","85","157","185","9","28"

PS2 is so diverse and adaptable to so many play styles for each individual person and this is reflected in its felixibility of the class system, the versatile amount of land vehicles, aircraft, weaponry available and also the numerous ways to implement tactics. The game spans over 4 stunningly huge continents where 3 factions have to fight eachother with the goal of total domination of each region in every continant. Its persistant never ending warfare!\n\nPros\n\n+ Immense large scale open world battles\n+ Versatile class system\n+ Visually impressive environments\n+ Satisfying competitive gameplay\n+ Great for teamwork & teamspeak gamers\n+ Nice customisation of weaponry\n+ Impressive map system\n+ Tanks, quad bikes, aircraft, jetpacks, stealth cloaks\n+ Intense and frustrating while very fun and rewarding\n+ You can form your own sqauds, platoon or outfit\n+ Freedom to go where ever you want\n+ Your playing alongside thousands of players\n\nCons\n\n- While this game is free to play, it will feel very grindy and you will need to put in the work and many hours of gameplay like I have to be able to unlock new items and skills using certifcation points, which are basically points you earn in-game for doing various things. :) If you arn't up for the hustle and grind of starting from the bottom and working your way up slowly you can always purchase station cash with real life money to buy everything you desire, but its not cheap be warned. I appreciate that this game is free to play, although I do find everything to be very expensive when you do the math on most items. However, in my opinion its more down to having skill, persistance and patience to be good, I wouldnt really label it as a pay to win game at all, the element of buying station cash its just an easier way to get stuff faster if your willing to pay, but if your skilled, why worry, just play, learn, and most of all have fun, even when dieing! :)\n\nMy Verdict: I have grinded as a 100% F2P gamer earning cert points and it hasn't taken away my gaming experience at all so don't be discouraged, I worked for what I earned and I really enjoy this game everytime I play it and fully recommend giving it a shot, its frikkin epic! 9/10 â\n\nShort Update: As of recent I have actually bought some Station Cash 'SC' purely just for Cosmetics, I had to add some swagger to my characters. xD","September 26, 2014","true","033.5"," 194 of 236 people (82%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","82","194","236","9","1"

Want something more? Planetside is where it's at.\n\nThe game spans across 3 continents on a distant world, and on those continents lies a three way war between factions. The game features multiple vehicles from land to air, and they are extremely fun to operate. Teamwork is close to essential in order to win battles, and it allows you to form squads of 12 players, and a platoon of 48. Battles can be up to 100's of people clashing inside a base with tank rounds flying overhead and enemy fire giving you a new haircut. Things get pretty crazy, which also means you're going to need a pretty good machine to run it. Although there were some impressive optimization updates recently, it still needs a good computer. The game also features in game voice channels to communicate with your teammates. Planetside also uses Certs (Certification points), which are basically the way to unlock things and level up. It takes a while to get certs and things can be expensive and quite frustrating, but IMO it helps from people maxing out really fast and running around with everything maxed out. There is also Station Cash, spend real money and get it (But what can you expect from a F2P game like this?). Aside from money, the game has 6 classes all having something important on the battlefield, from medics that can heal and revive, to heavies who can kill tanks. The game is loads of fun and you will be spending hour upon hour capturing territory and defending bases (Which I forgot to mention is the objective of the game). The three continents are Esamir (Snowy), Amerish (Greenery/Mountains), and Indar (Desert). The factions include the Terran Republic (High fire rates, lots o' ammo), the New Conglomerate (Slow, Hard hitting), and the Vanu Sovereignty (Alien tech, low recoil). I recommend this game more than any other I've played. So, pick your side, and join the fight!","January 12, 2014","true","096.3"," 176 of 212 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","176","212","0","2"

All of this spread across huge maps that span several dozen square kilometers.\n\nAll of this is absolutely free. There is a Membership option, but it by no means provides a game-breaking advantage. You seriously don't have to spend any money at all and you can still fully enjoy this game.\n\nThe downside is there is no 'end-game'. When you spawn, your objective is always the same: Defend the Point, or Assault and hold the point. Even when your faction manages to dominate an entire continent, there is no real significant reward for doing so. You just move on to another continent and do the same thing. There's no story progression, no truly meaningful events, it's all one giant game of lazer-tag.\n\nIf you're just going to start playing, chances are you're going to be a little frustrated considering you're going to be at a disadvantage. As you play, you earn experience for things you do, this experience rewards you with 'Certifications' which are in-game currency. These certifications are the only way (short of pay-to-play Station Cash) to upgrade your weapons, armor and abilities. So you'll start with your factions most basic weapons and abilities, fighting against players who have upgraded versions. I dealt with this by viewing it as a challenge to overcome and still managed to have a great time.\n\nI would suggest avoiding the temptation to buy 'Station Cash' in order to give yourself an edge because most equipment is pretty expensive. You'll be spending $5.00 for a single gun. I was initially offended by the prices, but came to realize it's a good thing as it keeps people from just buying everything and becoming a 'Pay-to-Win' game.\n\nI hear the game is even better if you're playing with your friends. I've been primarily playing solo and still haveing a great time.\n\nWhile this game may not be record-breaking, it's still a lot of fun. Considering how many FPSs are on the market today this one has managed to capture my attention more than most.\n\n"Loyalty Until Death, Strength in Unity"","October 15, 2014","true","690.4"," 146 of 180 people (81%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","81","146","180","10","0"

I put down the shield regeneration bubble to recover my teammate's shields up and I start reviving my teammates. Also our engineers are supplying our teammates in the front. We all know that we're in a pich and that we need immediately some help. I see several friendly inflantrators sniping down enemies from behind, which is pretty much helping us a lot, but not nearly enough. Then I hear something beautiful behind us and from the Platoon chat. Our max crash is coming, and it's going to push the enemies back by a bit. We might be able to turn this war upside down for now.\n\nThis game... It's a fantastic game, especially if you are in a platoon with people who know their stuff and know how to give and listen to orders. It's basically a neverending war in a huge zone, where you capture areas and with some main areas, you will gain bonuses for your faction.\n\nOnce a faction is getting together and making up plans, strategies and orders, this game is an incredible game. It's not just a basic futuristic battlefield, but it's something where you really need and want people to stick together and fight together.\n\nI know several friends though, who love to play this game alone than in a platoon. I don't myself see the interest in that, but I guess it will give you more freedom. I just myself love to move in a huge mass with other people, always managing to make people push back and supporting my teammates with either ammo or heal.\n\nWhen the game was still pretty new (in the first year of it's publishment), it was poorly optimized and gaining certs (which is the free in-game currency) was nearly impossible and a long process. Now though, the game works much better and certs are easier to get, turning the game not to be so pay-to-win anymore. Sure, you need 1000 certs for a gun, but the first guns you're using is pretty much as good as the guns you can only buy with SC.\n\nThis game seriously is a must-to-try. It's an interesting game and really has some decent graphics and an amazing gameplay. When I stopped playing this game because of my low FPS, I felt like always coming back, but never being able to. But now, after getting a new computer, I'm running on semi-stable 60fps, even in huge fights. There still are some minor bugs and minus sides, but those don't really affect the gameplay that much. Only sometimes, but not usually.\n\n9/10, you should try this out, even if you're not into huge battlefield games.","November 13, 2014","true","113.9"," 122 of 146 people (84%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","84","122","146","16","6"

A massive online FPS game? Wow, looks like Battlefield 4 can shove it right up their rusty cornhole because Planetside 2 just blows it out of the water! The firefights are intense, but sometimes I'm left saying "What the everliving â¥â¥â¥â¥ just happened" and I'm left watching my character drop to the floor just to find out from the death screen that "Mr. XX420NoScOpEzXX" just killed me by shoving his gun barrel so far up my rectal cavity that I could pull the bolt back with my tongue, and somehow I still come back for more!\n\nNow, I'm not one of those guys who is quick to whip out the credit card number and demand my insanely overpriced upgrades and weapons, because I enjoy actually earning my stuff! Like, if there is a competition and all you do is just buy the trophy, What did you accomplish? You just bought a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing trophy because you're a lazy pile of â¥â¥â¥â¥ who couldn't run a mile on Wii fit while sitting down! You want to earn that trophy! Run the mile, get the trophy, and go home feeling accomplished! So then you can tell your mommy and daddy that you just did something with your life! Unless you're 35 or older in which case your parents are probably scolding you to get the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of the house, or your parents are dead and your cat is left paying your rent because you're too busy buying â¥â¥â¥â¥ on Planetside 2 and League of Legends.\n\nI digress, Planetside 2's gameplay is far superior to most online shooters especially due to it's HUGE amount of players and it's intense firefights. My friends recommended this game to me and at first, I didn't want to be caught in another online bandwagon because inevitably that wagon either tips over because of the fat guy from 4/chan posting Shrek is Love, Shrek is Life Part 2/Chapter 2/Section 3/Paragraph 16, or the wagon ends up driving off a metaphorical cliff because the damn leader of this wagon decided to jump off and man another wagon, leaving us hopeless sheep in the cart, heading towards our permanent fate. Unless you're intelligent enough to either stay AWAY from that bandwagon, or get the â¥â¥â¥â¥ off when you know that â¥â¥â¥â¥ has officially hit the fan, and sometimes it's not even â¥â¥â¥â¥. Most of the times, it's shotgun diarrhea and it ends up knocking the fan over and killing one of the passengers in this god forsaken wagon, BUT I digress...\n\nWhere was I? Oh yeah, my friends recommended this game to me and at first I was very skeptical. I didn't want to get involved in something that I couldn't handle, but of course I just HAD to be a cool kid for once in my life and say, you know what? Maybe I should try this drug you call Planetside 2. Don't forget the eyedrops! Anyway, I played the game and It was love at first sight! It was an intimate moment with the loading screen and I chose the Vanu race (BECAUSE MY FRIENDS PEER PRESSURED ME INTO IT), and I moved on. I got in game, went through the tutorial and I was immediately thrown into the action! God this game made my â¥â¥â¥â¥ rock hard!\n\nLet me explain the gamplay, ok. Imagine yourself in a peaceful area, filled with gun and explosions and â¥â¥â¥â¥ rock, and then you notice and enemy player in your sights. What do you do? There is no marker on the screen telling you to shoot that guy because he's a different race or color than you, you just automatically assume that this guy is a threat if you don't pull the trigger first, he's gonna lay your â¥â¥â¥ out on a platter. So, you aim down your sights, you've got this guy right in the center of it. You pull the trigger, BAM!!!! Silence....... Then Mr. BLaazinQuIcKScOpEs ends up planting bullets in you like a god damn greenhouse at point blank range. Then the little â¥â¥â¥â¥ has the audacity to say "U ned skilz bruh!" Ok pal, look. I don't know where your parents are, but I think it's time for a parental lock to magically appear on your daddy's PC. The gameplay overall depends on what most online shooters depend on. Who shoots first and who has the better aim. Also who has the better weapon. It doesn't matter if you pump lead into his bullet sponge â¥â¥â¥, if he has a bolt action sniper and he can aim with that thing, you might as well sign your epitaph buddy! Aside from barrel-stuff Bobby and camping Carl, the game can get very enjoyable with 300 tanks rolling down the damn road, just as long as those tanks are on your side, and the same goes for aircraft, but tanks are the primary mode of transportation and destruction so enjoy the brutal butt-â¥â¥â¥â¥ing or the hardcore gun porn! My â¥â¥â¥â¥ is so hard now, it has gained sentience and is now singing the Canadian National Anthem!\n\nFor a verdict, I will leave that up to you people! YOU choose the verdict because this game speaks for itself. You either like it, or you don't. THERE IS NO IN BETWEEN! Just don't jump into the bandwagon with 4/chan fat â¥â¥â¥ or follow the Rump Ranger leader into is other bandwagons. This isn't your mom. We can't just keep hopping from one â¥â¥â¥â¥ to another! Stick to your own path, and if anyone questions your motives, always remember.

Both sides are plausible. It's an action packed realistic first person shooter, but has a huge learning curve. There's also the arguement of whether or not the game is P2W or not. I'm not really going to go into that. I played this game when it first came out, when I had a computer that was hardly capable of anything. A few years later when I had an actual good PC, I got addicted. It's not a game that you would play forever. For me, I play it for a bit, then leave it, then later on go back on and play it for a few more hours. I've personally had a lot of fun playing this. If you're looking for massive open worlds and dozens of player controlled battles to delve into and thats free to play then I would recommend this. If you're not a fan of huge learning curves, then this game might annoy you a bit.\n\nNOTE:\nAll of my reviews are laid out in a particular format that fits the game.\n\nAbout\nPlanetside 2 is one of my favourite MMOs, mainly for how immersive it is. The game is split into 3 factions: Terran Republic, New Conglomerate and the Vanu Sovereignty. People who've played the first game might recognise some of the lore in Planetside. The war is set on a planet called Auraxis. These 3 factions are fighting for control of 4 different continents; Indar, Esamir, Amerish and Hossin. These continents are filled with different bases to conquer and defend. Bases are crucial to conquer the continent, and are hard to conquer without a good number of people. The factions have their own stories behind them. The Terran Republic are from Earth, and believe in law and order. The New Conglomerate are freedom fighters, seen as terrorists, that are against the Terran Republic's control. And finally the Vanu Sovereignty, which see technology as the way for humanity to achieve greatness. At the beginning of the game, you get to choose which faction you want to fight for. You are given 3 character slots, so you can have a character for each faction, (Unless you get membership which gives you an extra slot). As I mentioned before, all the battles in this game are player controlled, meaning there are no NPCs. Continents can have up to thousands fighting, making it a very realistic experience. The game has 5 different classes, each with their own unique role. These are: Infiltrator, Light Assualt, Combat Medic, Engineer, Heavy Assualt and a special class, MAX. As well as battling on foot, there are vehicles that can be brought into the fight. These can range from tanks, to mobile spawnpoints and even to aircraft. The game allows you to set up squads which bring players together to conquer bases or sneak behind enemy lines making this a very realistic yet futuristic experience.\n\nGameplay\nAs mentioned earlier, it's an FPS with a huge learning curve. The game tries it's best to give players the help they need to survive in battle by giving tutorials, and recently, a smaller continent before people of battle rank 15. Some people find these helpful, others don't. I covered quite a bit in the About section. The game is split into 5 classes, the world map is split into 4 contintents plus the added smaller continent, vehicles range from tanks to aircraft and much more. There's just one tip I must give, never go alone. Unless you are really stealthy, you won't survive by yourself. The game prompts you to be with a group of people, or at least be there when a fight starts. The game allows the creation of squads that people can create and invite friends or other random people to join them. For people not wanting to make squads, there is an auto join option which will automatically put you into a squad. There are also groups called Outfits, Planetside 2's version of a clan. Some of these have guidelines to follow before joining, which should be displayed by the owner of the outfit. The game has a vast amount of different weapons for different classes. To buy these weapons, you are given 2 different payment options. Certs, which you passively gain from kills, capturing bases, completing missions etc., and finally Daybreak Cash, which you pay real money for. This is where the arguement for the game being P2W comes from. Some weapons require you to pay Daybreak cash, and not certs. Some people think these are the better weapons, and the ones that you pay certs with are terrible. You can either pay for a certain amount of Daybreak Cash, or get the monthly membership that gives you 500 daybreak cash per month, along with other things.\nAnother note worthy thing, this game requires a good internet connection. A bad one can result in many problems.\n\nDesign & Graphics\nIf you have a good PC, you can see the amount of effort that the developers put into the game. In all 4 continents there is an amazing amount of detail, with the environments, the bases and even things like vehicles.\nGraphics however is a different matter. I can run the game fine on ultra, but I've seen many problems for other people. Running this game on high can give serious lag and Framerate drops. Also having a bad internet connection can affect the game badly.\n\nUI [User Interface]\nI found the in-game hud quite easy to follow. When taking damage, your health and shields appear at the bottom middle of the screen, right above your ability, and ammo. On your left you have a minimap, showing the local area. The top left part of the screen shows the chat, and the top right shows the kill chat. There's quite a few settings when scrolling through the options, nothing that was too hard for me to find. I didn't have any problems here.\n\nPros - Highly Realistic\n- Huge Worlds\n- Dozens of player controlled battles\n- Plenty of content\n- Beautiful design\n- Still gets updates\n\nCons - Huge learning curve\n- Highly graphic dependent\n- Possible P2W elements\n- Requires good internet connection\n\nFinal Recommendation\nAfter getting the gist of it, this has become on of my F2P games. Sure, it ain't perfect, but hell is it fun. Diving into a huge battle, explosions all around me with guns blazing never felt more fun. If you can handle the learning curve, this can be one of the best MMO/FPS game ever made!\n\nFinal Verdict - 9/10.\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/218230/\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41QFL4QB3NE\n\nIf you liked this review, be sure to give it a like!

(we still didn't get any phase 2 to any of the phase 1s that currently ruin the game [like the resource system phase 1]).\n\n- weapon/class balance is terrible and the devs are generally out of touch/base their tweaks on spreadsheets, micro sales or forum/reddit outcries.\n\n- bugs, bugs, bugs, some still existing ever since beta. every patch creates more bugs.\n\n- game's netcode is clientside based, making the game pretty iffy for competitive play, where you die behind walls or can exploit packet loss to your advantage (therum style). the devs support the community with a competitive server you can scrim on (jaeger) doe.\n\n- base design is bad and boring for the most part. recycled assets everywhere makes for a very repeatitive feel to the game.\n\n- the game's engine can't handle big 96/+ v 96/+ fights. infantry starts to not render at normal ranges. mainly a problem for vehicle players.","February 6, 2015","false","034.8"," 410 of 617 people (66%) found this review helpful 65 people found this review funny","66","410","617","65","68"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dicentium/recommended/218230/","Dicentium","Dicentium","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dicentium/","28 products in account","Planetside 2 is a great game that is both enjoyed and hated by many and I am here to tell you why.\n\nWhat is this game about?\nTo get to the gist of it, there are three factions who are fighting for territory and each have their own different reasons. There are 4 continents to choose from All the lore of the game is online on their wiki and is actually well worth the read.\nhttp://wiki.planetside-universe.com/ps/Lore#Plot_Summary\nYou have probably heard about the massive battles that take in Planetside 2, and if you haven't, you are missing out. Each server holds up to 6000 people spread out to have 2000 people per continent. That makes each faction have about 666 people. When you get into the really big fights, trust me, it's a sight to see.\nThere are 6 classes that you can choose and customize. Don't worry, you can switch classes anytime from spawn. Each class has their own specialties, for example, the heavy goes in the front lines while the infiltrator snipes from above. There are many weapons to choose from and upgrades to purchase. Along with that come the vehicles that range from small motorbikes to huge â¥â¥â¥ cargo ships that can hold a full squad.\nFinally there is a lot of exploration to be done. The four continents are huge and even I haven't been to each of the stations yet. Each map is made for a different type of person. For example, Hossin has a mountainous terrain meant for snipers and air vehicles while Indar is a relatively flat continent for tanks and infantry. There are many detail I can go into but you should find them out for yourself.\nIf you already read this far, congratulations! Now I will talk about the pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n- Sexy graphics\n- Massive battles and experiences that can not be had in any other game\n- Moments that feel scripted but they are really not\n- Teamwork capabilities with squads/platoons\n- You can be a leader of up to 48 other players\n- Great range of different weapons to choose from\n- No pay to win aspect (although some could argue)\n- Developers are in touch with the community and make frequent updates\n- Every person makes a difference and affects the outcome whether you are a heavy in the front lines or an infilitrator shooting from a distance\n- Rewarding points gain\n- Rare to no team kills\n- Friendly community that like to help noobs learn to play\n- 3 factions to choose from, each with their own types of weapons and vehicles\n- 4 continents to choose from to fit your play style or to try something new\n- Great game to play with up to 48 of your friends\n- Moving to PS4 soon for console gameplay\n\nCons:\n- Tutorial teaches you almost nothing and then you are dropped into a massive battle with no experience\n- Huge learning curve\n- Will die non-stop for the first couple hours until you understand how to play (best to have a friend teach you)\n- No official online tutorials from SOE\n- No knowledge of any icons unless you search it up or ask someone\n- Large game download\n- Can get repetitive if played alone\n- New weapons cost way too much and takes many hours to get enough money to buy one\n- Bugs (but developers fix them up pretty quickly)\n- Lots of advertisement towards purchasing a membership (obvious reasons though)\n- If you capture a continent, there is no party, barely a message\n- Hard to start your own squad without friends\n- Best squads tend to be full\n- Lots of lag with low-end computer (although you could just lower settings)\n- Only for Windows\n- Less fun without a microphone because you can't ask questions and it is harder to lead a squad\n\nConclusion:\nOverall, the pros and cons balance each other out with the pros being just a bit better. Trust me, it is really fun to go grab a group of your friends and play together. The game is a lot of fun and sharing the experience with your friends is even better. Overall, I would rate the game an 8.5/10 and would recommend it to anyone.\n\nIf this review helped you, please give it a like, thanks!\n\nQuick Tip: If you decide to play with a group of friends, someone needs to be the medic.","October 16, 2014","true","118.3"," 72 of 93 people (77%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","77","72","93","6","0"

Sadly, I don't think it will bring many players back so I'm going to reserve judgement as yet but I'm holding out hope on that. I really want this game to get a second wind, and I can see that happening as development on other projects slows and they can reallocate resources to Planetside. Fingers crossed.\n\n________________________________________________________\n\nGame has been dying for a couple of years, and Daybreak (formerly Sony Online Entertainment) have basically turned it into a cash cow. Game is grindy as â¥â¥â¥â¥, organised BR 80-90+ players completely roflstomp everything that gets in their way, and the lack of population means that one faction is ALWAYS at a disadvantage. Now, winning might seem nice - if you're on the winning team, obviously - but when you're winning by a landslide because everyone dodges you and goes to another continent, you're just moving base to base while not fighting anything and waiting for bases to capture (until, of course, the aforementioned organised high battle rank outfits show up and roflstomp you into the floor). If you're on the losing side, it's even worse - the faction that's facerolling everything because they have 5-10% more population than anyone else? Yeah, they also probably conquered two of the four continents. So you don't even get to play on the continents you like to play (this was the final straw for me).\n\nBottom line is that it's fun for a while. I mean, I played 640 hours. Plus, it's free - definitely give it a shot and see if you like it. However, after a year and a half of â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ updates to keep people happy while they slowly dropped the game, it's in a really sorry state. Do NOT play without friends.\n\nFinally, before you downvote please actually take the time to assess the review instead of blindly downvoting just because you love the game. If you've only picked up the game in the last four to five months then please avoid voting - you just don't know how different the game or the development schedule is now compared to how it used to be. Not to be rude, but that is mostly what I'm basing my review off. Again, I am NOT saying to people simply avoid the game - I would love it if the playerbase improved but a single review will not change anything, and for this reason I cannot recommend the game in it's current state.","November 23, 2015","false","639.6"," 178 of 263 people (68%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","68","178","263","10","0"

I'll do my best to try.\nI started playing about a week after this game's release. In the past year I've been playing off an on.\nPost release, Planetside 2 was, besides poor optimization, the best damn first person shooter.\nI'm sad to say that it has lost much of it's original glory. While it still holds a special place in my heart, I have since moved on. Battles used to rage on for days. Back in the early days of PS2 I seen fights for The Crown last for weeks -- Literally a nonstop bawl for one base. Now, even during it's peak hours, large scale battles are hard to find and just don't last nearly as long as they use to. Now I will admit, I believe this game has turned me into a jaded PS2 vet because fights just dont wow me anymore.\nEnough about that sappy â¥â¥â¥â¥, so here's the facts:\nThe optimization issues still seem to be a thing - 3 years since release and they still can't get it right. Go figure.\nHowever there is some talk about optimization again by DayBreak but I'll believe it when I see it.\nPoor faction balance is still a thing. I'm more of a forth factioner but I do agree that the NC get very little love by development.\nAgain, going into its third year since release, we still have to deal with the same quarks and bugs now that we had at release.\nWhile the game isn't dead (go to the community hub you'll see an average of 2.5-3k players on just in steam alone). It is slowly dieing. Many players have picked upand moved on to other games. This kinda thing isn't surprising when a game lacks depth.\nNo any real new game mechanics. I log in and still see the same old zerging from base to base. Wrel (youtuber and now part of the Daybreak Dev team) has a sizable amount of content covered on his youtube channel that if implemented would bring a refreshing change in the game.  Instead, they throw in new helmets, a shiny new gun, and call it an update.\n\nI could go on, but I'll stop here. Would I recommend it? I think I would, but I say that biasly, because I've had the privilage of playing along side some of the coolest guys around.\nHowever looking at this game from face value, I'm gonna have to say no. There's plenty of other games now-a-days that can get you your clusterâ¥â¥â¥â¥ fix.","October 20, 2015","false","107.8"," 156 of 239 people (65%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","65","156","239","11","0"

In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg.\n2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla.\n3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat.\n4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed\n5.

There's an incredible amount of diversity in what you can do. For infantry, there's a ton of class diversity. Infiltrators can snipe or make good usage of their cloak and SMGs to get up close and personal with the enemy. Light assaults can fly up buildings and take advantage of people's lack of situational awareness to rain C4 on them. Heavy assaults can wreck havoc with enemy vehicles and other infantry, and you also have medics and engineers which perform about as they do in other games. Infantry combat is great, and while it does need some tweaks, it's overall pretty balanced. Then there are ground vehicles, one specific tank to each empire, an all purpose 1 man vehicle, armed buggies, ATVs, troop tranports, and each empire with it's own flavor of weaponry. Again, some small balance issues, but things are largely balanced. Flying in this game is a bit different than others, and while it doesn't take long to get the hang of it, mastering it is fairly difficult. If you can get it down, though, it's easily the best way to make your presence known among your enemies. Again, there are balance issues, especially between the 3 types of combat (Infantry / Ground / Air), but overall the weapons feel pretty good and once you've learned the various quirks the game has it can be a real blast.\n\nThe bad. This game uses client side hit detection, which is not bad in and of itself, but when you combine that with any degree of latency and the game's low time to kill for most weapons, you can often be dead before you are even informed that you are under attack. This can make getting into the game extremely frustrating, as you often die before you even know what's happening. Vehicles can be an utter nightmare to infantry, even infantry equipped to fight them, as most vehicle AI weapons kill infantry so fast that you don't even have time to aim a weapon, much less charge or lock a target. But as a vehicle, if a single infantry gets near you and manages to put C4 on you, it's pretty much game over. In short, everything feels like a glass cannon, Spawn times are so short that people you have killed can be back in the fight and shooting at you before your own shields have even started to regenerate. Killing someone just doesn't feel effective because they're just going to be right back before you can even think twice about them. Logistics and tactics in the game are becoming less and less necessary as you can immediately deploy to any base that is being captured. There are vehicles in the game specifically designed to transport squads, but they're useless for those purposes because they just aren't needed.\n\nBut my main reason for not recommending this game is not gameplay design, but what the develoeprs refer to as "Quality of life" issues. Multiple bugs are introduced with every patch, and many of them go for months upon months without seeing a fix, if they ever see a fix. The game honestly ran smoother for me in beta than it does now, despite my computer being vastly more powerful and having fewer people to render. Around March of 2014, they introduced a hit detection bug which causes anywhere between 50%-80% of my shots to do no damage, even though their server "verifies" each hit as part of it's anti-cheat measures.  Myself and several dozen other players have been reporting this and done everything we can to get the devs' attentions, but as of yet it has seen no fix, or even an acknowledgement that it's being looked into. Try playing a game where you have to land twice as many shots as your opponent does to accomplish the same effect. It's not fun.\n\nIn August, a bug was introduced that caused people leaving vehicles to be ejected into the air, often falling to their deaths. It's hilarious, sure, but imagine playing that way for more than a night. We're more than halfway through October, and there's no fix for it. It had been reported on their test servers for more than 2 weeks before the patch with the bug went live.\n\nThese are just two issues when each patch introduces a dozen more, often the same ones that then get hotfixed a week or two later as if the devs forgot to make it a part of the standard release. Patches recently have implemented half finished resource systems, altered UI elements that made upgrading things more difficult, or changed small notifications about being in a queue to take up 10% of your screen and contain less information with broken buttons. For the UI, it's like they have people changing things for no good reason without any overarching design in mind when the things already there are doing a perfectly good job. Month after month goes by with changes that are supposedly being worked on not being released, in favor of seasonal content which most players find frustrating or annoying.\n\nAs a side note, twitter and reddit are your best bets for information about the game and reporting bugs to developers. The official forums are lucky to even get patch notes.\n\nSo in short, the game has a ton of potential and offers a wide variety of combat that can be a lot of fun. Give it a shot if you want, it's free. Unfortunately, it's in the hands of people who don't understand basic concepts like not pushing out a patch that contains game breaking bugs.\n\nEdit as of 9/10/2015: All of the bugs I complained about are still in game in some form or another, along with tons of new ones, over a year later. Avoid this game if you want a quality experience.","October 20, 2014","false","311.5"," 227 of 359 people (63%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","63","227","359","7","11"

There is so much to this game that it is impossible not to find something to suit you. Are you the type of person who likes to grab the biggest gun out there and destroy everything? Are you the type of person who likes to hang back and pick-off enemies through a high-powered scope? Do you like to play the support guy and provide ammo or healing for your team? Or maybe you're the type of person who doesn't like ground combat and instead you like to fly around in a single-fighter and shoot down enemy vehicles and ships? Do you like to do all of the above? Well you're in luck with this one! You get to do all of those things!\n\nNow, you may be worried that this game is another pay-to-win game since it's free-to-play. Wrong! It's more like pay-to-get-things-faster. But this game is in no way giving the upper-hand to the person with the biggest wallet. So balance is definitely not an issue when it comes to equipment.\n\nThis game contains 3 factions:\n\nThe Vanu Sovereignty relies on energy weapons. The Vanu Sovereignty's weapons excel in accuracy and range while maintaining a fair amount in other things such as damage and fire-rate. The Vanu Sovereignty also has the most agile main battle tank in the game with its ability to hover and strafe. So it's fair to say that mobility and precision are the strong points of the Vanu Sovereignty.\n\nThe Terran Republic's weapons excel in unloading ammunition quickly. A fair balance of accuracy and damage, but when it comes to putting down targets quickly, the Terran Republic definitely has the upper-hand in this one. Chainguns, twin-cannon battle tanks, this faction is for anyone who likes to fill the air with explosions and bullets in a quick amount of time.\n\nThe New Conglomerate knows only one thing: Power. Sheer power. The guns of the New Conglomerate are by far the hardest hitting weapons you'll see. While sacrificing precision and fire-rate, if you have something that just will not die, you can count on the New Conglomerate to put it down quickly and walk away laughing. Enough said.\n\nOn top of having 3 factions, each faction has 6 classes, each with their own specializations and roles to play. The selection of vehicles amongst all the factions, both air and ground, is also impressive. And if that's not enough to impress, then the scope of the game will. Once you take-up a flag, you can take the fight to the enemy over 3 continents... with more on the way. And content is always rolling in as combinations of new weapons, cosmetic items, and game fixes are added weekly.\n\nAnd as a definite plus, the DEVs and administrators of the game are also there to lend a hand as they are ever alert and on the look-out for trouble-makers.\n\nSo if you were looking for a new FPS game that is massive and is no cost to you, then look no  further than Planetside 2. This game definitely deserves a thumbs-up.","June 22, 2014","true","428.7"," 53 of 71 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","53","71","0","0"

This game used to be to good  untill 2012 maybe early 2013 where they made a big patch which just changed the game and alot of its aspects which turned to crap. Big unbalance between Factions, guns and classes have gotten worse. Bugs and exploits are more common as time and new patched go by as well. They keep adding silly things to vehicles and odd guns which happens to be recolors or retextures of guns that are already in the game but for their in-game cash shop instead of balancing fixing bugs in the game. I might be burnt out of this game but I know for a fact that the game isn't what it used to be around 2-3 years ago. Dev's seem not to care (from what I see) about the game. Latency and hit Reg aren't the best at times and bugs/exploits tend to take months to fixup when all it takes is a hotfix. Thanks for reading my essay ehehehehehh.

A massively multiplayer online mmo fps.... and on such a large scale that it will blow your mind.\n\nUsed to the 16vs16 or maybe even 32vs32 large maps?\n\nWell try 100vs100vs100 in one fight on a server with 2k players.\n\n\nBut with that come some setbacks.\n\nSome even call it pay to win, but really it isn't. Yes, you can spend 2-3 days to grind for a new gun or you can buy it right away. This gun wont give you any significant advantage what so ever, but it does save you a lot of time. Evidentally it is flawed.\n\n- Most standard issue weapons really aren't that good. New players suffer a setback for up to 1 week\n\n- This game has RPG elements, so everything you want or need you have to unlock. Getting max lvl is going to take you a year (at least for the average gamer) and even then you will only have unlocked 50%\n\n- Although all vehicles are available to you from the start, any vehicle that isn't upgraded wont pose much of a threat if any at all\n\n- Very low amount of objects (flora, structures, boxes, etc), overall the worlds are very empty\n\n- Poorly optimized, you want to run this game, get a new gamer rig in 2015 to handle ultra settings\n\n- Client side hit detection (you will die even though you make it behind corners or drop to half hp before you even see an enemy player) This works to your advantage as well, but overall this is a truly awful.\n\n- In large fights, making an impact or significance is impossible and that random guy will show up and end your killstreak eventually. It is very hard to make it past 11 kills without dying or super camping.\n\n- The xp gain is extremely slow\n\n- It is next to impossible to recover or counter any attack if you are the first to take a hit (unless you are up against a new player)\n\n- Many items/vehicles are utterly un-balanced\n\n- Lots of glitches and bugs\n\n- A HUUUUUUUGE amount of useless weapons\n\n- Horrible tutorials\n\nIn all honesty, this game is still a BETA and needs a lot of work. But the biggest downside to this is how hard it is to find a good fight. Infantry vs Infantry duking it out for hours over a base.\n\nOften one faction will sit in a superior possition and simply farm the other. Should an equal fight actually appear (which is  very rare) it is typically ruined by vehicles or a ZERG.\n\nA zerg in this game is a big amount of players grouping up in a unstopable horde and just capping base after base. The problem is that there is no fighting going on.\n\nFinding a good fight is really really difficult. Sometimes there aren't any. Because it is all about population in the current part of the map.\n\nIt doesn't matter how good you are, you will never defend a base from 5 players alone. Let alone more. The community thinks that this is the way it is supposed to be, but sitting in a base, aiming your gun at the enemy spawn room or out of the spawn room then moving on after 5min is super frikken boring.\n\nThe game is currently suffering from massive identity issues. As such, as a new player, you will feel like in a real war.\n\n- No idea what the F is going on\n\n- No idea how to get to where you are needed or supposed to be\n\n- Dealing loads of friendly fire and annoying the heck out of everyone\n\n- Feel like everyone's weapons are better than yours (because they are)\n\n- Feel like you don't stand a fighting chance to make an impact on the outcome of a fight\n\nAnd that's just it. You know those games where you, and YOU alone win this for your team? Well this is never going to happen in Planetside 2.\n\nBe prepared for a lot of frustration.","June 24, 2015","false","298.4"," 396 of 644 people (61%) found this review helpful 63 people found this review funny","61","396","644","63","13"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rajada_nab/recommended/218230/","rajada_nab","Xmus Jaxon Flaxon-Waxon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rajada_nab/","148 products in account","I have played Planeside 2 since it was in open beta. Even when the team announced that they had moved the game out of beta status, one could be forgiven for not believing them. While the devlopment team certainly made positive changes since beta, these changes are far too little too late. Everyone in-game has developed the ultimate strategy of rushing bases with overwhelming numbers, and camping the very limited defender spawns. Planetside 2 used to be fun, but it has been slowly degrading, evidenced by the fact that after years of stagnation, SOE was purchased by an outside investment firm. This shouldn't be surprising, but I can't say I'm any more hopeful for positive change.\n\nI thought games being fun was a given, but apparently the Planetside approach to this is to provide the fun to only certain sections of players at a time. This flawed logic stems from the poorly-designed metagame. Because there are usually only one or two options for advancement, there is no recovering from a losing fight. It's not fun to lose, or to stalemate, and it's certainly not fun to have absolutely no recourse against an over-populated zerg wave, crushing you into submission. There is no "going around" the fights, there is no "taking a small team of experts to wreak havoc behind the lines". None of the things that could be fun in a losing battle are strategically viable. If you don't already have a larger force, you have no chance to strike back, as fickle players leave the un-fun losing fights, to find more engaging gameplay.\n\nDon't get me wrong, you can certainly have some fun when you manage to beat back an enemy attack, or take a forward base swarming with opposition. But there's no fun to be had in a completely unfair fight. Saving up the ludicrous amount of experience you need to unlock a decent piece of hardware then getting to use your new toys to improve your game dramatically certainly is a novel concept. But if there is anything fellow negative reviews reveal about Planetside 2 (when they aren't down-voted on the spot) it is that a game can't survive on a novel concept alone. You have to have balance, variety, a predictable foundation with unpredictable elements built on top of it. These are things that Planetside 2 does not have in nearly high enough quantities.\n\nThis game isn't designed to be kind to new players. Being a new player in this came is akin to being chum in shark-infested waters. Nearly everyone has several advantages over you, and getting to the top of any particular class takes considerable effort. This wouldn't be bad if more experienced teammates and enemies weren't stealing all the kills and killing you faster than you can say "spotted". If you didn't play since beta and keep playing, you're pretty much stuck as the cannon fodder for as long as it takes for it to stop being funny. Even as the team adds more ways to gain certs (in-game experience), you'll likely need to save your first 20 ranks worth of certs to buy one of the numerous 1000 cert weapons.\n\nSOE has a bad reputation for rushing out incomplete patches full of new bugs and features that nobody asked for. Case and point,  a patch was released containing a highly controversial overhaul to the death screen that allows dead players to hone in on their killer's location, effectively breaking stealthy or sniping gameplay over its knee with a sickening crack. In addition the patch introduced many issues including:\n\n- Players/vehicles become randomly invulnerable.\n- Certain weapons do no damage.\n- Some bases start auto-capturing for no reason.\n- Stuck in the death screen until rebooting the game.\n- Equipment randomly locks or unlocks itself.\n\nThese are the kinds of things that were resolved in the beta, and should never have been allowed to return. Basic QA testing should have caught this. The fact that the developers can adjust one or two simple things and break four unrelated systems is beyond comprehension. And worst of all, the servers continue to operate and more players are abusing these glitches, ruining the game for everyone.\n\nThis is not an isolated incident. Game-breaking patches like this are not uncommon, and each time the development team slowly fixes them and apologizes. Then they promise this kind of thing will not happen again. Then it happens again in a couple of weeks. This might just be the definition of insanity. The devlopment team asks for help in locating bugs like this, but the amount that they actually resolve is maybe 10%. Hundreds of people still report various visual and mechanical bugs that haven't been resolved since they were discovered a year ago. This is the kind of unacceptable behavior SOE should be receiving the most flak for.\n\nHaving asymmetrical weapon balance sounds like a good idea in theory, but the developer's don't seem to grasp the finer points. Shamefully, the faction-specific weapon balance is so obviously biased. There is a common saying kicking around the playerbase that of the three factions, one of them each fills the role of easy, medium and hard difficulty. It is commonly thought that if you want a fire rate so ridiculous that missing is the least of your worries, you pick VS (easy mode). If you want to kill any opponent in one or two shots, you pick NC (medium mode). If you want fire ra- no, wait, wasn't TR supposed to have fire rate? Now it's magazine size. Oh, no wait, the developers removed the extra bullets because VS and NC whined about it too much on the forums, so forget that. This happens in cycles; someone on the forums whines and mass weapon balance changes are made. The changes always overshoot the issue and make matters worse by shifting the underpowered faction.\n\nLet me give a more concrete example. The developers made new faction-specific bolt-action sniper rifles. The VS got a rifle with a charge versus heat mechanic and infinite ammo. This is new, never before seen, it changes the game for VS snipers. The NC got a rifle with a delayed firing mechanic and super fast bullet speed. This is new, never before seen, it changes the game for NC snipers. The TR got a burst-firing rifle with the ability to select burst fire modes (1, 2 or 3). This has been done on several other weapons, it doesn't change a thing for TR snipers except that due to its poor range they'll be killed by the other two new snipers a lot more. I'm no gun nut, but I am pretty sure that being a burst fire weapon also precludes it by definition from being a bolt-action sniper rifle. I get the impression that nobody on the development team likes TR weaponry because it is too traditionalist and they phone it in when making new stuff for them.\n\nAfter 60 battle ranks of putting up with our boring, ineffective guns, I switched from TR to NC. My first life with default equipment I managed a 12 man killstreak, unheard of for me even on a rank 60 TR. This trend continued for several more lives. It was a terrifying revalation of SOE being so out of touch with its own game.\n\nIt's hard to feel like you are making a difference when capturing a base has no real effect other than allowing you to capture other bases. This game is desperately in need of a larger goal that can't be achieved through zerging around the map(s) alone. Tactics need to be more involved on a micro scale in bases and on a macro scale in continent domination. Bases are designed to ba a spawn-camper's dream with one or maybe two spawn points for defenders. When the tide turns against you as a defender, your best bet is to leave and find another fight or prepare to endure being spawn-killed for ten minutes.\n\nPlanetside 2 has some good concepts buried in the mess that is the current gameplay. I can't say anyone should play it in the current state however. We need to hold SOE to the same standards as any other company with a similar budget, regardless of free to play status. Avoid this mess like the plague, and don't be fooled by less scrupulous players.","January 5, 2014","false","113.8"," 399 of 673 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","399","673","0","20"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/redzy/recommended/218230/","redzy","Redzy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/redzy/","159 products in account","First things first: despite my almost 900 hours on record in Steam, the amount of time I spent in this game is around 2500+ hours between all 3 factions.\n\nAnother premise is that I am not a player of the original PlanetSide, having historically loathed mandatory subscription models over a one-time pay-to-play or micro-transactions model. I have heard many great things about the original game, though I'm not sureâhaving seen several gameplay videosâwhether that is mere nostalgia of a golden age now long gone, or actual objectivity. There are several aspects of PS2 mechanics that are a galactic improvement over the original, which featured mechanics that I am sure felt dated even back in its 2003 heydays.\n\nOf course, that aspect is far from being the main cause of discontent amongst the playerbase, seeing as PlanetSide 2 certainly has well-refined gunplay and vehicular warfare. The real issue concerning the game is whether it really is anything more than one large Battlefield Conquest match that only ends when you log out. Before answering that, I will go into a little bit of my own PlanetSide 2 background.\n\nBack in early 2012, I was one of the many discontent Battlefield 3 players who had been blinded by the flashy advertisement campaign for the game and decided to go for it. Needless to say the game itself was not worth the price, but it wasn't all bad, as I have met friends I have remained in touch with ever since. One of them linked me to videos and descriptions of this game, saying it encompasses our idea of what a Battlefield game should be like, but with much more to it: an open world, massively online multiplayer first-person shooter, can you imagine that?\n\nObviously, the first thing I do is sign up for the closed beta and wait for the moment I would receive a key with trepidation. Real life didn't let things go easily, and the day I received my beta key, I was away from home and only with a laptop that could barely run Minecraft. Meanwhile, the game hits release, and the only way I could experience the thrillâat least vicariously soâwas to watch YouTube videos in excitement and awe.\n\nHaving come back home by early February 2013, I decide to take a bit of dust off my PC by installing the game and playing it. Miller (EU) was the server I'd choose, as at the time of me starting up the game, it was the one with the higher population in my region. I tried all three factions in the space of a few days, creating a character, then deleting it, then recreating it to try the other factions. What caught my eye is that the bulk of the fights would take place in roughly the same areas, namely The Crown and its immediate surrounding areas.\n\nUp until that moment, the game looked extremely confusing and chaotic to me. However, fate wanted that, during one of these test playthroughs, I would hop into a random guy's tank and after a rather lengthy session of killing, we would add each other as "Friends" through the in-game function. He asks me if I were interested in joining his outfit (a.k.a. a guild), and me being a one-man-army kind of player, I was initially very sceptical, but decided to give it a try.\n\nEntering this first outfit, I found that the game's most important aspect was certainly the social one. It's comparable to other MMOs, but me being a FPS player with no real penchant for that type of games, I was certainly astounded by being in a community with over 300 other people! These outfits set goals for themselves that they try to achieve through gameplay, which is mostly condensed into prime-time and special events. This would keep the game alive even when otherwise dead.\n\nAt the time, the continents were still using the now-replaced (warning: game-specific jargon in italic) Hex system, without any closed Lattice lanes like today. This allowed for flanking strategies which made leading a large scale force rather challenging, occasionally causing cases of those infamous ghost captures. The game was nonetheless enjoyable, especially during prime-time and mostly in what is seen by all factions as the main continent to contest: Indar.\n\nThis created many exciting battles, with hundreds of people fighting for one small piece of territory, which often proved to be too much stress on the server's resources. Nonetheless, we were doing something you can't do in any other game at an unreplicated scale. This would not last much longer, however. In fact, two changes were crucial in altering the way the game played: Lattice lanes on Indar, and the infamous, rightfully dreaded Alert system.\n\nThe former solidified the rather fluid and flexible old Hex capture system into a rigid one, forcing platoons upon platoons into an irresolvable, massive grindfest around the newly formed chokepoints. This meant that the game became much more static and easier to decipher on the strategical viewpoint. The system had been requested heavily by the nostalgic PlanetSide playerbase, as it had appeared in the original game, albeit with a wholly different set of mechanics and gameplay tailored to suit it. This was not and still certainly isn't the case for PlanetSide 2.\n\nBesides that point, the game was certainly still playable, even though the other two continents at the time were mostly a ghost land. To change that aspect of the game, they decided to introduce the infamous Alert system. This would consist in a set of rather straight-forward objectivesâinitially capturing a continent, then also specific facilities, either globally or in a specific continentâto be completed in a limited amount of time, with a final reward. Sounds good, doesn't it?\n\nWell, in theory, yes. In practice, this skewed what at the time was normal gameplay in favour of redeployside, also known as rapidly re-deploying from one base to another to quickly defend them. This was mostly at the favour of the faction with the highest population, with each server having its own faction bias. Essentially, we had gone from "capture/free Indar" to "wait for alert, then pour all your forces into x or y for profit". The population soon started dwindling, not only due to these two great development missteps, but also due to the degrading performance caused by lack of optimisation.\n\nTime a few months, the "Operation Make Faster Game" or OMFG was announced. This consisted in a promise by the SOE President, and the developers themselves, to focus entirely on optimisation. After a while, the patch was pushed into Live servers. This brought back many players, as the noticeable degrade in UI look and overall quality of animations was compensated with much better overall performance. This was short-lived, as content started being dropped into the servers, and with it, new causes for overall performance degradation.\n\nThis was the history of my first year as a PlanetSide 2 player. Without mentioning the extremely half-arsed job at balancing the three factions without making them play the same, which caused months and months of the same weapon or vehicle being overpowered without anything being done to it. Moreover, the gameplay remains equally devoid of consequence: you log in, achieve a great objective in the hours you play, log out. Tomorrow, or even later that day, all the hard work you put in is erased.\n\nThis did not even include much about 2014, as I would say it was a pretty unremarkable year for the game's developmental cycle, and I was inactive throughout its last quarter. The most striking aspect of last year is the fact that the servers have since been performing horribly, with nothing being done towards it. This, coupled with the recent layoffs, as the company was recently sold and renamed, honestly contribute to my general disillusion concerning the game's future.\n\nWith all of this in mind, I sadly cannot recommend the game. However, by all means, give it a try. It's free.","March 8, 2015","false","901.7"," 135 of 219 people (62%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","62","135","219","11","8"

I've put in almost two whole weeks playing this game, it is that good!  I've played quite a few shooters in my day, not to mention MMOs, and this game is a perfect fusion of both genres.  In general, your objective is to control the map region-by-region while beating back the 2 other factions.  In addition, every few hours a system-wide Alert goes out to all three factions calling them to act to capture the same specific objectives, kind of like the region-wide rift invasions in RIFT.  These Alerts are great for focusing the war effort, imagine all three factions, 1000s of players, all pouring hot violence into a few objectives - it truly is a sight to see.  This AAA game is free to play!  No reason not to get it, and they recently have done some major patches to optimize the game so that it runs very smooth on less-capable machines (although it ran fine on max settings on my mid-grade system)  The F2P model here is not as restrictive as other games I have played (SW:TOR, anyone?), it's really not P2Win at all.  None of your abilities/upgrades can be purchased with real-money, you must earn them like everyone else.  You can buy new weapons & cosmetic effects with real money, but not the weapon upgrades.  For the record I have spent about $45 on this game just because with so many classes/vehicles to play with, it is a grind to get new weapons for all of them.  But to sum things up, $45 is still less than I would spend for a game of this calibre.","December 29, 2013","true","334.8"," 35 of 48 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","35","48","0","3"

It can have its moments that no other game can come close to recreating, but lacks any real driving force behind the giant battles which leaves you wanting so much more from the game that has failed to deliver for 2 years.\n\nPlanetside 2 features large, 600 v 600 v 600 battles on large 8km x 8km maps with a dozen bases that can easily fit the largest battlefield maps in them. Battles can be an intense fire fight as players use tanks, bombers, and variety of troop transports to gain ground and territory. These battles can be a lot of fun... IF a lot of variables are just right.\n\nBattles often have one side heavily out numbering the other, spawn camping the smaller group in their spawn while they wait for a cap timer. When big battles do happen, they rarely continue between bases. When one side loses the majority of the players scatter as the winning force then swoops in to take the connecting territories with no resistance util they get bored and try to find another fight.\n\nThe game seems afraid to give any direction to the players. this leads to new players wondering where to go or do. Its a game where coordination is required, but gives no tools to the players to do so. squad and platoon leaders have very little tools to keep a squad together or hand out objectives. The devs did start to implement a mission system to help with this, but stopped half way through and theres no word when they'll finish it.\n\nA lot of key features are also half implemented. Resources are used in the game to purchase vehicles and consumables for infantry. however, there is no way currently to get low on resources through normal play for very long. Players gain a steady rate of resources. there is no way to impact that rate when there should be to provide secondary objectives to players behind enemy lines.\n\nI could go on and on on how many things are half implemented or missing from this game that would make it a truly great game. However, the devs at SOE really fumbled it up bad. One of the former leads, Matt Higby, even admitted to some mistakes early on that cost the game dearly in design choices and in handling development of the game.\n\nWhile i don't recommend spending any money on this game, if your interested you should check it out since it's free. just don't expect too much depth.\n\nPros:\n- Huge Battles with hundreds of players\n- Runs well considering whats going on (on some computers)\n- local, squad, and platoon voice chat in game\n- Playing with an outfit leads to some awesome moments you can't replicate in any other game\n\nCons\n- Incomplete game. 2 years after release the game is missing SO MANY features, a good amount of them could be considered key or core features too\n- Lack of direction means battles or a clusterâ¥â¥â¥â¥ as people wander around killing each other wondering what to do\n- No real depth in any of the game's systems. Once you know how to kill efficiently alone or in a group you'll get bored quickly.\n- Runs poorly (on some computers), inconsistent stability across different machines.","May 1, 2015","false","84.8"," 36 of 50 people (72%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","72","36","50","4","0"

I will just focus on what makes this game great.\n\nMoments. That's all. The individual moments are what make and break this game. I've played the BF series to bits, but nothing compares to Planetside 2.\nThere is not a single game out there that can provide these awesome moments the same way PS2 does.\nThe sense of fear, futility, carnage, overkill. Running up a hill with your squad and reaching the top, overlooking a valley, seeing hundreds of vehicles coming towards you. Nothing i can type in here can convey that feeling. Realising you are just a cog in a huge war machine. You cannot be Rambo in here and that is why a lot of people have problems getting into PS2. You cannot just expect to spawn and mow down everyone just because you are 'you'. There are thousands of heroic moments taking place every single day in PS2.\nBlowing up aircraft with dumbfire rockets just because you timed the shot perfectly, taking down transports with 10+ players inside with well placed mines, managing to stall an assault on a base with 5-6 people vs 50, only to be overwhelmed seconds later.\n\nThis is in its core a team game. You join 12 man squads which in turn form 4 squad platoons. There are squad leaders, platoon leaders and everyone has to somehow coordinate with each other. And herein lies the beauty of this game. It is 'realistic' in that sense, you are nothing more than another soldier amongst the thousands around you, you have to do your tiny bit to help the advance or defence. There are times where 12 man squads are there to cover 1 side of a building, a single wall. You must stay on target, be focused, do what you are told or make the decisions yourself for your squad.\n\nThere is no plot, just excuses and reasons to fight. Sometimes you do not even fight on the objectives themselves, on the bases. Sometimes you will have a 1000 player fight over a single bridge, just because it is the tactical choice. There is no single overpowered class you can pick, there is no vehicle that will do everything, no gun that is more superior than everything else in your arsenal. You can work  your way around this game solo as well, but nothing beats joining an  Outfit and a teamspeak/mumble/ventrilo server and working with your teammates.\n\nIf you thought playing BF3-BF4 at the beginning of the map rotation, where everyone spawns at the base and gets into the vehicles and roll out together was cool, then yes, you have seen nothing, you know nothing (john snow). You can spawn your own tanks, aircraft, there is no limit to what the game can achieve/sustain. You will find whole platoons of 48 people using aircraft to maintain air control over a particular part of the map, while other platoons on the ground will consist of tanks only. You do not and will not understand the meaning of the phrase 'give them too many targets to shoot at' unless you play this game. There are a thousand ways to die and a thousand ways to kill in PS2. You have to learn to live with that. You might be sniped and switch to a sniper to counter that, only to be blown to bits by an aircraft strafing run.\n\nI could go on and on, but i suggest you spend less time reading reviews of this game and just download the damn thing and see for yourself. I am not here to suggest this game is the best game ever, neither is it everyone's cup of tea. But when it comes down to the scope, scale, potential and entertainment value, this game is unbeatable at the moment.\n\ntl;dr version :   10/10 for what this game is trying to do. A perfectionist or nitpicker will surely find faults in every title. But for a F2P game this is as good as it gets at the moment. Just download it and give it a go.\n\nps: Terran Republic forever!

I've been playing for a month since and I'll be revamping and adding more to this review in the next week or so.\n\nDon't get me wrong. I really really REALLY want to love Planetside 2. From it's core features, to its colorful environment, to the great soundtrack. I want to smother it to death with compassion and then â¥â¥â¥â¥ its corpse filling it with affection. Unfortuantely, as long as SoE is SoE, that will never happen. As long as The Smedlemite and his greedy little circle of friends at the top of the company make poor decisions based on their incompetence and mismanagement, this game will slowly yet surely die off.\n\nSo let's first make it clear, like so many other reviewers have stated; This game is still in beta despite launching in the Fall of 2012. The past year from the Summer of 2013 to present has had two major issues surrounding the game. The first one being randomly inserting bad ideas nobody has ever asked for. You might ask; well who the â¥â¥â¥â¥ randomly places â¥â¥â¥â¥ in a game without any want or demand by its community? Well SoE does, and as a person who's played SoE games for roughly over ten years (call me a sadist), this â¥â¥â¥â¥ is what Smedley believes will generate more money despite it blowing up in his face. Smedley is the barrel-scraper when it comes ideas in the Videogame Industry. Always two steps behind and always oblivious on how to execute them. Especially when it comes to attracting people (mostly to drain them of money).\n\nThe second problem is the lack of endgame features. Since the game is still technically in beta, so many core features that were prevalent in PlanetSide 1 have yet to make way into PlanetSide 2. These features are almost cruical on keeping the game from dying a slow yet miserable death. It's still an endless Team Deathmatch. You can't kick people off of continents making the point of defending a dead continent (Amerish) utterly pointless. In fact, the game's population has been dwindling since the Spring of 2013 because of this very reason. People get bored fast, especially with an MMO. And sticking around at Indar all day, while fun for the first few months, becomes tiring really quickly.\n\nThe third problem is performance. Thankfully, I never had problems with performance like so many others have. Possibly because the engine running this game is CPU based, and my CPU isn't a piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥. Not the first SoE game to focus on the CPU, and somewhere down the line I assume Smedley completely forgot that EQ2 had years of unoptimization since the engine was based on a single core CPU. PS2 is suffering a fate somewhat similar, yet not as severe. So SoE has chosen to focus on perfomance in the past ten months, which sounds great and all (begs the question on why not releasing it in the fall of 2014 instead?), but the primary reason seems to their desire to get the game to run on the PS4. Had SCEA not have pressured them to get it on the PS4, I doubt SoE would have given the slightest â¥â¥â¥â¥ if their customers are dealing with an unoptimized game or not. There are still problems that I face along with others, mainly if the battleground is filled with 100+ people. For a game that is about MASSIVE battles, having it not even able to handle a population just a little higher then a 64 player BF server on something like a Bio Dome facility isn't a good sign.\n\nThe fourth problem is the focus they attempted to push by attracting the MLG fanbase. For some strange reason, SoE believed that they could get MLG to play PS2. After all, MLG has a large and lucrative community. Of course to do so, they decided to focus on creating instance island skirmashes between contintents. The irony here is that these features have yet to be included into the game....and they were originally announced over a year ago. Again, another alienating idea that backfired onto Smedley's face. Not only has PS2 failed to garner the attention of MLG for longer then three seconds, but they gave a big â¥â¥â¥â¥ you to their original loyal fanbase by attempting to undermine the core concept of the game. No SoE, this is not Battlefield, this is not CoD, this is not Halo. This game should NOT have instances. Want to make a skirmash game? Then â¥â¥â¥â¥ing make one that isn't horribly stiched together to PS2.\n\nSo yeah, this game better pull a rabbit out of its â¥â¥â¥ soon. If not, the game will be dead for good. Populations that die on an MMO don't magically come back. Very few MMO's have ever made a comeback. Again, PS2 has so much potential, but is â¥â¥â¥â¥ed due to poor management and general stupidity that you find at the top of SoE's food chain.","June 4, 2014","false","343.6"," 180 of 304 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","180","304","0","20"

This is a game where you don't want to play by your self since it is a team game, you get the best expierence when playing with an outfit.  I can have fun while playing alone since I know what I'm doing but at first when you play by your self it does get boring since you won't know what you're doing and you know nothing of the game since it does have a STEEP learning curve.\n\nOnce you get the hang of it and know what you're doing it is fun to play by your self when you're in a zerg rush which is basically an unorganized attack where everyone just attacks a base, cap points, hold them, cap the base, etc. which can be fun to take part in since some zerg rushes can overrun a base within seconds which is terrifying if you're on the defending team(I've seen it happen before) but it's even more fun when playing with an outfit or a group of friends.\n\nHow big can battles be? Each server holds about 10,000+ players and each continent holds about 2000+ players, and firefights can be ridiculous to be in as some get as big as like 400 vs 400.\n\nDon't expect a tutorial or story of how the 3 warring factions are fighting or why they are fighting of any kind, it just throws you right in, not giving you any time to set up your controls to suit your playstyle, or even know WHAT IN THE â¥â¥â¥â¥ING HELL IS GOING ON since you have bullets and rockets zipping by you and explosions going off left and right.\n\nThere are 3 factions same as the ones from the original Planetside, there are the Vanu Sovereignty, which use lazors and can be a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ to fight at night, and no bullet drop on their guns. Space Japan right? Yeah, the New Conglomerate which have hard hitting weapons, and a kickass rock theme, cause Space 'Murica right? Yeah.. Last but not least, the black and red, Terran Republic, which also have a kickass orchestral theme, and large magazine weapons, cause Space Russia(Or Europe not sure) right? Yeah. They're pretty balanced as they do have their strengths and weakness\n\nThere are 4 continents, some from the original Planetside. You have the desert heat, Indar, a popular, and mostly played one, the countryside, Amerish, with it's plains and countryside... ish land, the cold and harsh Esamir, another popular one, with it's somewhat rough terrain and lots of snow, and last but not least, PANDOR-*shot* Hossin! this map is very hard to manuever with aircraft due to the dense forest Hossin is, rough terrain, lots of ups and downs, and battles there are pretty heated.\n\nI wish the game explained a story of why the 3 factions are fighting and what they are fighting for it makes you wonder.  It would turn out to be a very good story but I heard that most of it is in books or so I've heard.  I really hope they add the empire's back story in the game on how they were formed, like for example on how the Vanu Sovereignty was able to collect and make plasma weapons.\n\nIs this worth the download? Yes, it is, but the only downside is if you're computer can even run it, let alone handle it. To get the best expierence make sure you look for an outfit through the outfit browser in the game but it's not that reliable so you'll have to look on the Planetside 2 outfit recruiting section on the forums.\n\nThen again, it really is a fun game and I recommend anyone who likes games that require teamwork and cooperation.","October 19, 2014","true","197.6"," 45 of 68 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","45","68","0","0"

I have previously told my friends this game "isnt really" pay to win, as battles tend to involve enough people to balance overpowered players out.\nwhile this is true, any time you find yourself alone, or spread thin, or single yourself out in any way, if you havent spent money, you will die instantly. over and over.\neven in vehicles, as a non-paying player, you stand little chance against any kind of enemy without backup.\nupgrades are EXTREMELY expensive without investment and are necessary to be even slightly competitive.\nyoull be grinding for days to buy even meager upgrades.\n\nof course there is no skill based matchmaking of any sort, as the whole map is a giant battlefield, so what you find is the players with elite equipment have battles, spending the downtime between worthy opponents mowing down new players. if youre reading this, considering getting this game, that means you. you wont be safe in your own bases as youll get experienced, completely invisible enemies prowling your base killing you over and over as you leave the spawn.\n\nI am open, and participate in on-going spending in games if i feel it is worth it, if i feel theres an end goal, but i get none of that with this game. i checked the store and quickly closed it after seeing the prices. its just not worth it.\n\nthis game needs a model more like robocraft that positively encourages premium, but leaves it optional. in its current state, i would only recommend it to experienced players willing to spend money, which leaves it a stale dying game. an excellent concept broken with imbalance. its a horrifically negative experience for new players. expect to consider a kill/death ratio of around 0.1 a goal. if the cost of all equipment was 1/10th of what it is now, i would say give it a go.","May 18, 2015","false","102.3"," 37 of 54 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","37","54","2","16"

You will die a lot, you will be confused often, and sometimes you just won't know what to do. However, at the same time, it will be an awesome experience. This game's trailers speak the truth. There are lots of players of all classes waging war against the enemy. Aircraft of all kinds will be constantly flying overhead, chasing each other in dog fights and strafing the battlefield. There will be tanks and Armored Personnel Carriers dotted throughout the escalating battles.\n\nAnd while it's a cool spectacle, you will be understandably overwhelmed.\n"Where is the objective? What do I do when I get there? Where is my team? Where is the enemy? Why does the announcer keep saying random stuff??? AAAHHH!"\n\nSo I - being a fellow noob - am here to give you some advice.\nYou have to focus on one thing at a time.\nYes, it's ok to take the scenery and the battle into spectacle appreciation, but don't let it crowd your focus. Listen very carefully to everything the announcer is saying. Take a minute or two to collect yourself. Ask yourself a couple things before charging into battle:\n"What is the objective?"\n"What is the lay of the land?"\n"Is my Team's offensive large enough?"\n"What kind of support do they need / how can I help?"\n\nNext, you should try every aspect of combat. Do you want to specialize in ground combat, air combat, or heavy armor?\nAnd just because you aren't doing as good as you had hoped, don't get discouraged. EVERYTHING in Planetside 2 takes time to get good at.\nI for example, decided that I'm very good at a supportive role on the ground and in the air.\nOn the ground, I'm an engineer, making sure all the tanks and other vehicles are in tip-top shape, and that every soldier has ammunition spilling out of their pockets. Or even placing turrets to provide suppressing fire.\nIn the air, I transport troops and other much-needed reinforcements to the field of battle, and that has been one of the deciding factors in battles more than once for me.\n\nThe point is, you need to find some way that you can contribute and make a difference in the battle.\nBut if you let your focus get away from you, you'll develop this mindset of "charging and randomly firing will work"\nAnd that is a bad habit. You'll always die like that. You aren't just another player.\nIf by the time you stop playing for the day, you can confidently say:\n"I made a difference"\nThen you're doing it right.\n\n\nNow get out there! The continents won't conquer themselves! You need to help!","January 30","true","27.0"," 24 of 31 people (77%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","77","24","31","6","0"

Shiny graphics in decent frames even on my average computer. (GTX 560, 3.2Ghz core.)\n\nThen about one or two weeks after came the first patch, and I'm not entirely sure what SOE was aiming at, but it literally broke the game engine. From being able to run the game at a ~70 FPS on high/highest graphics, after the 'patch' was installed my computer could barely start it up. It became a personal war on .dll files to even be able to play the game. This was the first graphical improvement patch that SOE released. This was apparently the kind of work that SOE considered an improvement.\n\nThey then went on to 'improve' the game balance by ruining the class weapons for one race while buffing the same class on another to the point it was the only one worth using. (Example: The Vanu MAX anti-air guns became more useful for shooting infantry with than that class' anti-infantry guns which got nerfed into the ground. The NC MAX anti-infantry shotguns became so powerful they could be used to destroy light vehicles at 200 yards.)\n\nAnd you might ask: "But the alpha and all that happened ages ago, and there have been many updates and improvements since."\n\nAnd I ask in turn: Do you think those improvements are deemed as such by you as a player, or by SOE? The team who within a month of release had managed to destroy their own game by trying to make it better? It's true that they released the Roadmap system to try and combat their own incompetence, but it was too little too late and it's not exactly something they have followed anyway.\n\nIn short, do not recommend. It's a weird situation where I say that the alpha and even the beta were better than the current release. If you want a sci-fi multiplayer combat game, try one of the Star Wars Battlefront games instead.","May 27, 2014","false","220.9"," 55 of 90 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","55","90","0","0"

A better way to keep Veterans over Rank 15 out would be to prevent players with ANY Rank 15 character from going to Koltyr, then make another small continent like Koltyr.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kekerle/recommended/218230/","kekerle","Dahaka","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kekerle/","29 products in account","EDIT --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI am editing my review as I have put another 110+ hours into the game since the original review was posted. I think I can explain the game additionally now seeing every side of the game.\nOver those 110 hours I realized the game doesn't change mainly because of the community.\nThe community, what's left from it is all veteran players that have been used to the system for so long. No changes will be made to the game as its community is slowly but surely dying. On peek times around 4000 players a day, not a good sign, to top that SOE just announced merging of 2 US servers because of low population.\n\nAs a new player:\nthe game is extremely harsh for new players, not only are you put in a significant disadvantage from the start with crappy weapons, you are thrown into the game without a single idea of where, who or what you are doing or suppose to be doing, against all max ranked players that dedicated their lives to farming you.\nOn top of that, anyone trying to get into the Vehicleside 2 side of gameplay is pretty much sure to fail. As all players are on the same map at the same time, your stock vehicle will get melted in nanoseconds, your only choice is to get stomped for probably hundreds of hours until you get it good enough so you can stomp infantry and vehicles alike.\n\nOh but wait! You can always put your credit card out so you can buy better infantry weapons, only 7 bucks each! And they don't transfer over your other characters..\n\nThis section will be for the thoughts of the community, I have spent a lot of time trying to get into the mind of these vet players and even though this is not the thought of EVERY player, it is of the majority.\nGeneral thoughts of vets:\nInfantry is scum, almost being NPCs in a true MMORPG. those NPCs are for farming certs (currency which is used for buying all weapons and upgrades), the only true skill in their mind are massive vehicle battles, (one hand on the mouse, point and click and the other is for you can only guess what), the order is like this, infantry is the worst (almost everyone agrees on that) < tanks < aircrafts. Whole game could be compared to an MMO where your character is in a vehicle and farms infantry - NPCs.\nGood thing this game is an FPS MMO, because that's a complete lie. Being a foot soldier in this game is considered primitive and everyone who enjoys the FPS aspect is an ape in the eyes of the community, naturally SOE gives in to their requests and with every patch either messes up that fragile "balance" or completely throws stuff out the window. For them it is completely fine for infantry to get one shot by almost every vehicle weapon, but vehicles are almost godlike, in firepower and survivability.\nOnly thing in question is which vehicle will be the most powerful one.\nAnyone trying to even suggest a change on the forums is only met with responses similar to "go play cod kid".\n\nOnly thing I got wrong in my original review is the rebalancing part. The whole game requires complete revamp of major game mechanics and design choices, something that will never happen.\nDon't even try this game, I can't recommend it simply as the community is dying and what's left of it is under illusion Vehicleside 2 is how it's suppose to be.\n\nMy old review is still correct and gives good examples of the "balance" in this game, luckily I can put this game to rest once and for all on my part.\n\nOriginal review ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHello everyone,\nWhen I first saw this game I was looking for a casual FPS that could satisfy my need for killing. Sure enough, this game did the job, hundreds of people on the same map, maybe even thousands, who knows.\nThe game cannot be compared to Battlefield or Call of Duty, features unique playing styles with a lot of diversity in weapons and classes.\n\nGood sides,\nmassive online fighting pretty much all day long, 3 major maps on which you fight, each one with around 40 other sub maps for you to capture or defend, open world shoot out, terrain limitation is almost none, you can create your own pathing for the best position and ambushes. Great weapon arsenal, a ton of guns from SMG's, assault rifles, snipers, you name it. The guns mostly perform differently and look differently, 3 factions for you play with and they are all unique.\nCrazy battle moments with vehicles like tanks, light vehicles, air units, the whole idea is to feel a part of something greater than a common soldier and this game nailed it, the feeling when you fight 100 vs 100 is epic, even though you might be playing alone. Probably best of all, you get all these good things free.\n\nSadly, like every game, this one has downsides, flaws that destroyed the game for me.\nThe game with all of the air and ground units has serious balancing issues. Massive battles mostly turn into a camp fest when one side brings in around 20-30 tanks to one base. Camping the spawn point of the other side, pretty much destroying not only their defence but the whole experience of the game.\n\nInfantry is unbalanced as well, out of the daily best players, all play heavy assault or light troops, pretty much 2 classes are chosen all the time because of the weapons and their survivability, not very interesting for the other "weaker classes".\nOthers have decent utility but when it comes down to who can tank more shots, which you might think is important in a 100 vs 100 game...those 2 are pretty much the only choice.\n\nAir offensive is just as bad, like tanks, they pretty much have unlimited ammo, spamming the whole artilery on just one guy that actually made it 10 meters from the spawn. All vehicles beside one or two are very hard to destroy, taking around 7-8 anti-tank missiles, after which they simply hide behind a rock or something to be repaired within 5-10 seconds and the process repeats itself, considering 1 player only needs to press deploy on a console and instantly has a tank or aircraft to drive, not a fun experience at all.\nWhat to say about balance when an aircraft, "Liberator" dives in, sits, yes, lands on 2 tanks and destroys them instantly without taking almost any damage, also most vehicles don't take damage from anything than rockets or flak cannons, found on other vehicles mostly...\n\nGame also has some bugs that makes some players invincible, hackers, almost none, I don't really know, might be a few, but it's a free to play so I don't mind. Also the game randomly crashes several times a day, even has errors with Nvidia graphic cards that makes the card turn off for some time in the game only, causing you to lose the screen for some time.\n\nThe game in general is good for anyone who just wants to shoot something every now and then.  It has problems like every other game does, but these I can't just ignore.\nIt has potential but requires balancing.","March 30, 2014","false","266.3"," 115 of 199 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","115","199","0","16"

However, in my opinion, the game has slowly been ruined over the last 6 months or so.\n\nFirstly, the developers continue to release 1,000 cert weapons which means you either have to grind for around 10 hours to earn a single gun, or fork out real money to buy them. This is not particullarily bothersome after the first few unlocks, but soon becomes tiresome.\n\nSecondly, The developers continue to release a weapon for 1000 certs, than release a new version that is better in almost every way, wasting the money/time people spent on buying the old ones. A Cynic would say that the developers were being greedy. Examples of this in the Tr are the Hailstorm (far superior to the armistice in clip size), and Rams .50 (far superior to the Sr-7 in damage and bullet velocity).\n\nThirdly, the continent lock system now means that most of the time i can no longer play on the continents i want to, because the silly system stops you playing on a continent for a period of time if it has been conquered, taking away the players feeling of freedom and exploration and instead forcing them to areas they may not want to play, this can also be applied to the lattice system that restricts where you spawn on a continent.\n\nFinally, the game continues to be incredibly unabalanced with players new and old repeatedly mowed down by ESF rocket pods unless they themselves use them, and the developers do not seem to intend to ever fix this.\n\nSo Overall i would not recommend this game in its current state, though i will continue to check every couple of months to see if things improve.","October 17, 2014","false","455.8"," 57 of 94 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","57","94","2","0"

The first reveiw was more detailed than that, but that's the gist. I pointed out some sound flaws, and held up the graphics and stability of the engine and server. I basically said it was not my cup of tea. 6 out of 8 people found my review helpful, either saying âHey, I love games that repeatedly kick me in the balls!â and others who say âOh, That sounds like a waste of my time and energy.â Either way- helpful.\n\nThe 2 people who did not find my review helpful took it upon themselves to say I was being to harsh, and also said I âCouldnât review the game after only 1 hour.â I did. He was clearly in denial! But I downloaded the game AGAIN, just to be sure.\n\nAfter 5 hours, I can say, I would not recommend this game to a friend. I just donât think its fun! Howâs that!\n\nVehicles- they are okay. The controls are messed up on the aircraft though. WAY off weirder than anything Iâve ever played were you fly a plane. But hey, Iâve never piloted an aircraft, what do I know? I know this wasnât fun.\n\nCharacter models- They are okay. You can customize them with certificates (or something) you earn or money you pay. Pretty cool. Also hard to tell people apart in various kinds of light. Itâs not so clear cut as red dudes shooting blue dudes, when only small elements on a personâs suit are colored so, and the lighting is a hazy beautiful sunset PURPLE. The high tech futuristic  HUD doesnât know if a guy is friend or foe until its too late. Maybe you can buy an upgrade for that . . . I donât care.\n\nControls- they are okay. They are what I would expect. I like 3rd person with cover mechanics better, personally. I say 1st Person Shooter and honestly, you know most of the controls. Nothing special, It gets it done.\n\nLandscape- You are on a planet with some continents divided up into a bunch of hexagons. There isnât much in the way or realistic geological terrain, overall (like you see in Arma and DayZ- beautiful and realistic). It is more of that sculpty lumpy mountain looking stuff, and here are some really big rocks, trees, a swamp, like that. Some places are better than others. Itâs not bad, itâs just nothing special. There is a base every 100 meters or so, no infrastructure, no towns, no cities, no villages, no civilians, no factories, no mines, no wildlife, no nothing. This is a planet full of military bases and there are three factions of really stupid people fighting over it FOR WHAT!?!?   Honestly, I donât care. I didnât see anything worth fighting for. That brings us to . . . .\n\nStory- The planet should be a desolate wasteland of craters and corpses. Or maybe one of the factions would have just nuked the whole place from orbit? Basically these three armies are fighting each other with guns and vehicles when they have these machines that just SPEW soldiers into the fight. Put them in vehicles or squads, or drop them unrealistically from low orbit. They run about and die, only to be spewed back out of the machines and given weapons and pointed in the direction of âenemyâ like suicidal lemmings!  Why? There are evil republicans, of course, high tech homosexuals, why not, and super awesome rebellious Rock-and-Roll rebels! I don't know what they are fighting for.\n\nThe Action- The most fun I had was repairing stuff. I followed some tanks around and repaired them, used their guns until they needed repairs, repaired them. Me and a billion others took a giant mushroom place. Cool. I repaired some guns and shot at tanks and repaired some AA guns and shot at aircraft. Cool. I climbed a mountain and got shot in the face. Disappointing. Most of it is spawn, turn a corner die, spawn run a half mile, die, spawn, grenade, die, spawn, fall, die, spawn, try to repair some shield generator, get shot in the face, die.\n\nWrap up- This is the longest review I have written. I honestly, just donât really like wild disorganized hari-kari PVP. This is not a team assaulting a fortified position . . . It is three armies â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ at each other as hard as they can, and whoever is standing on the pile at the end . . . wins?\nAfter 30 minutes, I knew it wasnât my thing. After 5 hours, I feel cheated. I canât get that time back and I gained nothing as a human. I already know we are insignificant and conflict is ultimately pointless. This game offers me nothing I canât have somewhere else and have more fun. Does that mean you will not like it? By all means, use that free will, you may love it. I have met plenty of people into S&M. Would I recommend it to a friend? I did, because misery loves company, but I regret it. It was wrong of me in my subjective view of morality as it stands now. I hope he will forgive me one day. NO, I will not recommend this game to a friend. If they ask, Iâll just say âNah, thatâs not my cup of tea.â\n\nIs there anything they could do to change it and make it more palatable to me? No, and I donât think they should. The game has an audience that loves it. Let it be.\n\nUninstalls like a champ, even the second time around.\n","June 23, 2015","false","5.7"," 52 of 85 people (61%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","61","52","85","16","0"

The primary reason for this would likely be because it plays nothing like the first game - it retains the same kind of scope, but for the most part the core mechanics are completely different.\n\nI realise now I was hoping for a graphically-updated clone of PS1, and while I accept that wouldn't exactly constitute 'progress', I'm not convinced that the design decisions made here push the game on in any great leaps and bounds.  As an example, it's worth comparing the inventory or loadout system of the two games.  In PS1, players built their own loadouts from the ground up with overall carrying capacity dictated by the type of armour worn.  The weapons and equipment available were restricted by the branches of the various combat disciplines that had been unlocked - using points gained by levelling one's character.  This approach allowed for HUGE variation between loadouts for individual characters and meant that genuine mulit-tasking was possible.  By contrast, PS2 has a much more rigid and defined class system which will be more familiar to players of 'traditional' shooters and is arguably less daunting to get to grips with - if ultimately more generic and unsatisfying.\n\nLess tangible - but equally off-putting, for me at least - is the feel of the battles.  PS1 often had very clearly defined battle lines and it was possible to sense and react to the ebb and flow of battle.  I don't get this in PS2 at all.  Large outdoor fights give the impression of many self-contained deathmatches all going on at once and seem utterly disorganised.  Is this a result of the pacing of the game?  Possibly.  I believe the TTK may be generally lower than it was in the original and this coupled with the faster character movement undeniably makes the game a very diffeerent proposition to the first.\n\nI'm quite sure than in its own right, the fare on offer is enjoyable to many - just don't expect anything like the slow(ish) pace of the first game and the almost 'trench warfare' scenarios that could develop.\n\nOverall, I really wanted to like this game but the sad truth for me is that it's lost too much of what made the original so special.\n\n4/10\n\nProdigalSon (Emerald)","January 18","false","17.4"," 20 of 27 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","20","27","0","0"

First, you can look at it on its own, and then you can compare it to Planet Side 1.  If you are new to Planet Side, you can ignore this review, as it is an average game for most, but as the follow up to the stellar Planet Side 1, it falls flat.\n\nPS1 was a constant battle to take over land from other teams, but what really set it apart was its pacing.  Sure, you could get tied up in a massive battle, but you could also wander off to a quiet (but not abandoned) continent and earn some points by gathering NAT.  In PS2, there are no non-combat activities, much less ones that earn you EXP and help your team.\n\nPS1, taking part in battle was an immerse experience.  Players never magically appeared out of nowhere, they actually opened doors and hatches, and climbed in and out of vehicles.  PS2 takes a step backwards by switching to the Battlefield-like instant teleportation.  This is a huge oversight.  How would the game feel if you teleported through all doors?  Why stop at vehicles?  Hell, why even have reloading animations?  Nothing shatters one's suspension of disbelief quite like seeing matter quantum teleport en mass right before your eyes.\n\nPlanet Side 2 also removes your home continent, a in-game place you could retreat to, recover and organize a huge raid in.  Nothing can compare to the shear cool-factor of (visibly) climbing into a Galaxy transport, only to join a swarm of others, all marshaling for the invasion of a continent.  Now you just spawn in on the front line and magic-craft your vehicle.  Yet another failure.  In PS1, vehicles actually appeared to be coming from an automated factory, not just poofing into existence because 'nano machines?  Yeah! NANOMACHINES!'\n\nPS2 is a great looking game, but the rest of its content consists of Call of Duty like compromises in the name of instant satisfaction.  These developers think we are idiots, all demanding fewer milliseconds before we can get our first kill.  It is more likely that the impatient ones scream far louder than the rest of us who enjoy a varied and nuanced experience.  Not only will I not die if every second of my time isn't spent killing or being killed, I'll actually enjoy how glorious combat is when it is punctuated amongst quieter moments.\n\nTo put another way, PS1 was like Saving Private Ryan, insane action, but with meaning and finesse giving it purpose.  Planet Side 2, like so many other games these days, is a Michael Bay movie with the human moments cut out, nothing but a non stop explosion-fest without relent or purpose.\n\nHighly disappointing.","August 10, 2014","false","89.1"," 33 of 51 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","33","51","0","0"

This game presents combat on a scale unrivaled by any current title out on the market, and it's done this for 3 and a half years. There is no other game out right now that can simulate the strategic importance of manpower allocation, while simultaneously providing a great shooter experience. You can kiss your 5v5, 8v8, 12v12, 24v24, and 48v48 shooters goodbye because when it comes to sheer size the 450v450v450 over the 64 square kilometer maps of Planetside blow all these games out of the water, not to mention that the game also has a player base construction system as of a week ago, turning this game into the Massively Multiplayer version of a love child between CnC Renegade and the Battlefield franchise.\n\nAll praise aside the game still has issues, the new player experience is awful, the tutorial sucks, mostly because it no longer exists, and the game will not hold your hand beyond a short message each time you encounter a new aspect of the game. Due to the game's sheer size the game is riddled with bugs, thankfully the majority of the major ones have been fixed in the time since launch, but there are still a few stinkers here and there. The game game map's massive size also means that on off peak hours finding a fight can be difficult, but still possible on if you look hard enough.\n\nSo, do I recommend this game? Yes, if you are willing to endure the gauntlet of skill curve of Dark Souls and the level of tutorial of Dwarf Fortress. This game can easily be the best you've ever played, if you take the time to learn it.\n\nHere's a few tips for new players:\n\nDon't be discouraged by dying a lot, lots of people in a fight means you will get shot from everywhere. (Including your teammates if you aren't careful)\n\nStart by playing a support class, (Medic and Engineer) this will allow you to contribute to the team without worrying about getting a ton of kills, and will help you learn how the battles flow so you can understand how to play the combat classes more effectively.\n\nJoin a squad! The game is an MMO, which means playing with other people is the mainstay of the game, good squad leaders will help you learn the game as well as find, or make good, fun, fights for the squad to participate in.\n\nCommit at least 10 hours to the game before you decide to put it down. I know a lot of people think the game should sell itself in the first 30 min of gameplay, but this game almost never does, and if you put it down before you see the depth of the game you will have deprived yourself of one of the best Multiplayer experiences in the industry.","May 4","true","557.9"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","77","17","22","4","0"

All these complaints are, to some greater or lesser extent, true, but I still love this game. The scale is like nothing else I've ever seen: this is a pure PvP shooter where the server is an entire planet with thousands of players rather than a single battlefield with a few dozen players at most. Infantry, ground vehicle, and air vehicle combat are all seamlessly integrated with one another. It's free, and it's perfectly viable and enjoyable to play without ever paying a cent. It has a broad and very helpful internet subculture around it. There are three different factions to choose from, alike enough that skills learned in one faction will be useful in another but different enough that there are clear pros and cons to each. I recommend everyone give this game a chance.

"Is this Pay2Win"?\n\nWell, from my expierence, no, well, you can buy XP-Boosts. But is that already P2W? Some would say yes, I would say no. Sure, you get more "Certs" to unlock new weapons, all of them, to be specific. But it doesn't give you this much of an advantage.\n\nThere are only 4 or 5 weapons, that are only accessable by paying. And that are the same weapons as you already have, just in a different skin. And the default weapons, are usually as good, sometimes even better, than the "premium" stuff. But even if you buy a weapon, you will still have to unlock all the attachments you want through playing, since there is no way of buying these with real money.\n\nWhat else is there to buy?\n-Skins.\nYou want to look cool? Spend some money.\n\nAll in all.\nI wouldn't call this Pay2Win, since you don't get an unfair advantage over other players with buying guns, since even the permium guns are not OP, honestly, they suck, for the biggest part. Money is just a shortcut to getting new weapons, since everything that is important for the gameplay is unlockable just by playing. It just takes longer.

It's just tons of fun to fly in this game once you get the hang of it, which might take a while.\n\nPlanetSide creates such a unique and epic gameplay that I havenât seen before in any other game out there.\nWith the size of such a big game, and the continuous integration of new vehicles, cosmetic items, new game features, new continents (maps), etc the overall amount of small bugs isn't less unfortunately, some of them are more frustrating than others.\n\nThe most heavy bugs are being fixed very quickly, but the smaller bugs, such as the landing gear bug of ESFs (aircrafts), squad team mate is not marked green on the minimap when you shared the vehicle with them and spawned a new vehicle for yourself again, no afterburner bug, UI display within ESF's doesn't display correctly or even completely miss to load, drop pod bouncing off and takes you back to the sky, error spawn at a location you havenât chosen, etc. etc. I don't want to make the list to huge but you get the point, such numerous small bugs unfortunately seem to take the PS2 dev team forever to fix. Some of the bugs are almost 1 year old if not even longer..\n\nPerformance and stability wise it has gotten better over time compared to the state of the release, but I think itâs still far from sophistication and has room for more improvements.\n\nStill, I play this game since its open beta back in September/October 2012 and it does not get old for me any time soon.\nIt's (still) not a perfect game and still does need polishments but as every game has its flaws, the most weight falls into its epic battles where you often find yourself in a big fight of around 100+ soldiers in 1 Hex (that can be comparable to the size of Caspian Border in BF3), hearing all the explosions, gunfire and soldiers talking around you, seeing the bullet tracers everywhere, raining bombs from Liberators (Gunships) which creates every battle to a nightmare, devastating MAX suits (exoskeletons), soldiers with jetpacks on the roofs of building or huuuge tech plants, the mystical atmosphere of Bio labs, Hossin swamp land where the fights turn into a spacey Vietnam style war with just more swag and huuuge trees, dogfights ala WarThunder, being part of a organized Platoon Galaxy drop (huge troop transport aircraft carrying 12 soldiers, 4 of them and you got a the idea) and crush the enemy, and whatnot. The immersion is PS2 is simply stunning, mindblowing, and addictive.\n\nPlanetSide just got a big soul that gives the player a lot of capabilities and stuff to explore and to play in different ways, a cool and open minded dev team, and a very nice community.\n\nAgain, it comes with flaws like every other game, it can be overwhelming and not intuitive at the beginning, offers you a lot of WOW and aha effects, becomes great and mindblowing 'at the middle' and it might happen that you burnout at the end when it becomes stale and just a big "FarmSide" and/or "huge TDM".\n\nIs it worth the prize you might ask.. Definitely since it doesn't cost you a single penny because it's a Free to Play model which is imho perfectly designed towards "Pay 2 progress faster" , elsewise simply unlock the hard earned stuff by your own by progression.\n\nPay4swag\nCosmetic stuff can be bought, some are more or less optical gorgeous, thatâs all a matter of taste;\nBut the real cool thing here is that even the players, the community itself can create cosmetical content and benefit from it. Creative heads can design stuff by their own and if it gets approved by the admins, it find its way to the game and the money earned from the players buying the swag, get shared to both hands, the creator and PS2 team. Creative content creators from the community already earned several thousand $ that way, just impressive.\n\nThis review is already longer then I have expected and I still have the feeling that I didn't even told you half of it what could describe the magic of PlanetSide 2.\n\nGive PlanetSide a try if you havenât yet and let yourself mindblown by this unique unique F2P sci-fi MMOfps game. :)","July 16, 2014","true","18.9"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","9","10","2","0"

At the same time, hundreds of people battling in clusters of anywhere from 10 to 100 on a side means that as an individual soldier, your presence matters far less that in other shooters. Killing one to several enemies almost inevitably reveals your position to other enemies who will rapidly end your life, driving a tank across the field results in all enemy tanks and anti tank gunners to quickly end your life.\n\nThere is no room in this game for solo or lone wolf style play beyond perhaps sniping in a support role. As a team game however, the game does work quite well.\n\nUltimately, the downfall of the game is that every point of conflict ultimately boils down to a very simple formula of attacking and defending capture points. The dynamic aspect is centered around where mobile spawns are placed and how many people happen to be on the attacking or defending side.\n\nNow I admit, I do not have many hours invested in the game on steam but at this point, I dont feel much more time is needed to understand that this is essentially battlefield without the destructible environments and a larger player pool.

Graphics wise the level of detail is truly stunning and on a surround sound system being in the midst of combat really does sound like you are in the middle of a war zone.  Bullets fly, explosions rock the floor.\n\nUnfortunately, the stunning graphics and sound are NOT matched by an equally stunning gameplay or development team.\n\nExtemely repetitive, and VERY slow to advance in this game is more a grind than a game.  Tedious and frustrating in the extreme the game is unbalanced and quickly becomes a chore to play.  When you have to play for several weeks in order to upgrade a single weapon you know something is seriously wrong.   Because it takes so long to progress it is ESSENTIAL to spend real money in order to get the gear you need, making this game VERY expensive to play, and effectively pay to win.\n\nIn addtion many of the players in this game behave like complete jerks.  It is not uncomon to be shot or run down by vehicles driven by a member of your own team (some of which will deliberately alter where they are going to make sure they run over you).\n\nThe game also needs a VERY high spec machine to operate properly, and is unreliable.  Ongoing graphics problems, launcher crashes, this game has it all.  There are even websites out there with lists of error codes and possible solutions.\n\nBut, the worst part of the entire game is SOE who have consistently managed to make the game worse as they continue to "develop" it.   Their latest effort the All Access Pass is probably their biggest failure yet.  With the inability to merge different log in names this pass will only apply to people who have used the exact same login on ALL their SOE games.  If you have different logins you will have to buy a seperate pass for every single SOE game you play.  Sony don't bother to inform people of this of course.\n\nThis could have been such a good game, but SOE have wrecked it in almost every way possible.","May 15, 2014","false","505.6"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","0"

Your KD does not matter. You are just fodder in a grand conflict of hundreds of people being thrown at each other to die in a glorious(or less than glorious) fashion.\n\nAnd that is why this game is so freaking refreshing in FPS market covered with K/D ratio focused shooters that are so obsessed with telling you how great and important you are. Its specifically BECAUSE you do not matter that everything you do can matter - you do not need  to "score kills" to be useful and help your side. Teamwork is rewarded. Objective play is priority. You might not shoot someone in the head but you might heal, you might repair, you might build or you might serve as something as simple as a body-shield for your friend who is doing something far more important.\n\nSo if you are tired of shooters like Call of Duty or Battlefield and want to  take part in a glorious giant battles that last for hours, then grab some friends and join in.\n\nYou might not score "the kills" in your first time playing, but sure as hell  you will have a chance to find yourself in the middle of something mind-blowingly grand.\n\nPlanetside 2 does what CODont.","May 21","true","59.4"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","0"

Attacking with a wide variety of armoured vehicles, aircraft and Infantry. One soldier can make a big difference if he knows what he's doing.\nYou can have a massive dog fight going on overhead battling for conrol of the skies allowing their galaxy (Troop dropships)  to reinforce their team below. Hundreds of infantry fighting for control for individual buildings, in some cases one faction will have the top floor and the other the bottom, being bombarded by armoured convoys / blockades as each faction battles it out for control of the roads to support (Or farm) the capture of a base.\nYou can have intense squad Vs Squad battles for a base that will grow into a full on war, going from 15-20 players to 90+ on either side as your team comes to aid the capture or deffence.\nIt accommmodates the whole range of warfare be it you like to be a sniper or get up close and personal with a shotgun, ace fighter pilot to ground pounding bomber, tanker to logistics.\n\nYes it has "Zerging" issues where 2-3 rivaling forces meet at a fix point and battle it out for hours on end with it only moving on when one side looses aload of players from boredom of fighting in the same area - Or one force just dwarfes the other in size of numbers just stomping over anything and everything that they come into contanct with.\nThere are also copy & paste bases, facilities & buildings but I personally don't mind it so much. There is still a vast array of bases that are completely different from one another and it aids in PC performance.\n\nCould not recommend the Robert Stoneman machinima's enough !\n\nI think this game is underrated and not publicized enough and I can't go back to any other FPS after playing this as they all just feel so small.

The victors get awarded with more XP and bragging rights for the win.\nIn Planetside 2 you can have up to 2000 players on a single continent, ATM there's 4 continents in the game so a server can have up to 8000 people fighting each other, in the future when they add more continents they'll keep increasing the maximum player cap each time by 2000.\nBattles in Planetside 2 are pretty spectacular, huge tanks fights in large open fields, multiple large ships flying up in the air doing dog fights, organized outfits(Clans) working together trying to capture territory for their empire it's amazing when you see it all in motion, there's simply no other FPS Multiplayer game that can do this at the moment.\n\nNow that I'm done explaining the basics to the people who are new or are planing to download the game, it's time to share the large amount of problems the game has, let's begin :\n1 : For a game that's supposedly all about working together as  a team to win, people tend to play the game as more of a large endless Team Deathmatch, only trying to get more kills and higher KDr so they can get higher levels and get more medals.\nYes, this is an issue with the playerbase however the reason this happens is because the game is lacking a reason for you to capture territory and win things for your empire, you get far more awarded if you go to a fight where you can easily get some nice kills than going to a fight where you're outnumbered and trying to defend a base that's required to win an alert.\nThere's a large lack of a metagame and an endgame in Planetside 2, if an empire captures a continent nothing special happens, that empire only gets a 50% discount for vehicles or equipment for a short time which makes capturing continents pretty pointless.\nSo after a few weeks you'll realize there's no point in Planetside 2 except to get more weapons,medals and improve your stats which is really,really sad.\nThe game badly needs a good metagame and endgame so Planetside 2 can finally become that nice teamwork large scale game about fighting for your empire with your friends.\n\n2:The game has serious issues with bugs,low frame rate and constant crashes. The game just loves to crash on a occasion, the frame rate can hit such low levels the game turns into a power point presentation even on a above average PC,the game is infested with bugs where your vehicles might randomly explode because you touched some rock at a bad angle or you're unable to access the map to respawn forcing you to end the game with the task manager and the list goes on.\n\n3:The game reuses a lot of assets on different weapons, ALOT of guns in the game looks exactly the same and some even sound the same, they badly need to update these models so you can actually tell apart which gun is which without having to check a damn description.\n\n4:The game has serious issues with lag and hitbox detection, hitboxes in Planetside 2 sometimes just stop working, you might find yourself unloading all your ammo into someone at point blank range just to find out you did 0 damage to him and you'll die a fair amount while behind cover or going around corners since the game has some issues with lag compensation.\nThis happens very often nowadays to the point where i can hardly play the game anymore, some of the worst dedicated servers iv'e ever seen in a video game.\n\n5: The game has a lot of problems with bug exploiters and hackers, the game has a sewere lack of Game Masters to keep servers in check from hackers and people who bug exploit like clipping thru a floor and killing everyone on a capture point inside a base or a hacker who flies around in a tank or as infantry and headshots you immediately if he notices you and than just teleports somewhere else, Planetside 2 needs to have it's anti-cheat improved and more game masters for each server to keep things in check so these type of people don't ruin the game for everyone.\n\nBottom line, Planetside 2 will make you regret the day you decided to play it.\nBroken servers with extreme high pings, a hit detection that works only half of the time, a toxic,unfriendly and bad player base that turns newcomers into more toxic â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ that keep destroying the community, developers that fail to accomplish anything, lead directors that continuously lie to it's players and so many more things which i sadly can't fit here.","March 21, 2014","false","098.8"," 27 of 45 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","27","45","0","4"

Maps are huge and the game gets fairly dead at most times of the day (they cover it up with a population ratio as a percentage, and it's obviously with huge maps and very few conflicts).  You'll die instantly and repeatedly to people with better gear, hundreds of times per hour most likely, until you scrape the experience and "certs" to buy some of the better gear (OR you can pay them cash and avoid death grinding! :D).\n\nOverally gameplay is tedious, annoying, confusing, and illogical.  Balance is non-existent, base designs are abysmal (fire your â¥â¥â¥â¥ing map designer), and you'll spend most of your time WAITING to capture bases for very minimal experience.  Capturing a facility and there's not an enemy around for miles? Well, sit tight.  You have to wait a minimum of 6 minutes doing absolutely nothing productive while you claim your base facility... a horribly designed compound that has shield generators located OUTSIDE the base.  Oh, and it doesn't really give you anything by capturing it.  Oh, and it's going to get recaptured by an enemy faction shortly anyway.  Oh, and there's no meta-game.\n\nTags: Waiting Simulator 2014, Running Simulator 2014, Dying Simulator 2014","June 3, 2014","false","276.6"," 16 of 25 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","16","25","0","0"

First, it's the type of game where you have to either play a really long time to get anything good to use, or you can pay $$ to unlock early(which is what almost everyone does.) Also, youre almost always playing with veterans who've played since the game was open for play, mixed with people like me who just started a month ago and get killed within 30 seconds of playing. One other thing is that its really glitchy, which i understand its in beta still, but im playing on an HD screen computer and i have to have the graphics on the very low setting. This might have something to do with the fact that i dont have the Nvidia Geforce graphics card, but this graphics problem is still not very attractive. This product does keep you on edge though, because you never know when it will freeze or CRASH AND BURN!!!!\n\nWhile there are numerous problems, there are pros to this game. I like the squad feature where you can join or make a squad and everybody with good logic works together to get to a common goal. I also like the different vehicles, classes, and traveling to different continents. The worlds are really big, creating little conflict. The description of the game says that its a good strategy game, BUT DONT LET THAT TRICK YOU!!!!! The game does not run around strategy at all and its really just players running around shooting at anything that moves. The only time there is strategy incorporated in the game is when a small squad or small part of the squad decides to do something smart, but most of the time that plan fails because someone gets scared, decides to do their own thing, or screws up and dies in some painful way(dropping out of a galaxy and forgetting they're not a light assault class which has a jetpack, or getting a sunderer stuck in between some trees and getting blown to little pieces by some heavy assault class. Both of which happened to me and other squad members.) That is my review, and it wont change until i see a changes in the gameplay.

Or you can look at the map for where the action is and just dive in to the chaos. Alternatively, you can find a spot where you'd like to make a surprise attack and just go for it.  The important thing here is to find out what style of play suits you best and how to maximize your potential in harmony with that. In other words, play to your strengths. Figure out the faction, class, and weaponry combination that works best for you, and then attempt to play in such a way as to take advantage of your strengths and minimize your losses from blind spots and weaknesses.\n\nThe Good:\n\nChoice. You play the way you want, whenever, however, whatever that means. You play for as long as you want, wherever you want, however you want, and then switch it up at the whim or needs of the moment. Vehicles a problem? Go anti-vehicle with the class and weaponry of your choosing. Need to capture a point covertly? Go stealth either as a sniper or stalker. Or if you don't like that option, go heavy and hide. Or go light and be nimble. Heavy casualties all around? Go medic. Allies in need of support? Go engineer and drop ammo or heal vehicles and Max suits. Want to be at the forefront of an assault? Grab a vehicle and deploy a remote base for spawning. Want to be a leader? Devote resources to opening those skills. No matter where you go and what you do, the scenery can, at times, really impress itself on your senses. The music isn't bad either, and reminds me vaguely of the Firefly show. And, if you play a lot, you can earn certs which will help you improve your skills and gear. And if you're really clever and persitent, you can do well at this game without spending tons of money.\n\nThe Bad:\n\nWell, your starting gear is not great. You may get discouraged from getting stomped a lot. There are players who have obviously dropped money on the game, and a lot of it. You will need brains, skill, and persistence to succeed without spending money, although that's not necessarily a bad thing. And after playing for a time, you may agree that paying something for the fun you've had isn't bad either. However, the p2w feel of the game (pay to win) is more than just a subtle possibility. For instance, try playing one-on-one sniper to sniper in a battle with the beginning gear and see how long you last and how many targets you drop. Anyway, if you decide to stick with the game for any length of time, you're eventually going to want to spend somewhere in the neighborhood of $40-60 bucks to begin being on par with a lot of other players. And if you begin looking at vehicle improvements, well, the sky's the limit there.\n\nThe Ugly:\n\nThe only ugly I can really find in this game is the awakening realization that all of this is futile. War is ultimately pointless. Perhaps that's a good thing to teach people about war, but in the end you fight for a hill only to lose it again at the cost of many lives and much time. Boundaries are continually being redrawn, day after day. The battle moves from here to there and back again. And when a battle carries on for too long without much success, you'll find youself abandoned and staring at overwhelming forces alone when most of your allies have bailed because their morale is shattered or they simply don't have the attention span, resiliency, or persistence of a gnat (I'm looking at you, millenials). Of course, gnats get squashed all the time, so there's a time and place for everything I suppose.\n\nGive it a try if you like beautiful FPS games with lots of freedom and choice. Even if it's a bit p2w, you'll still have fun getting stomped.\n\n\nNote: Some aspects of play have improved since the game was first launched. For example, with the sunderer, you used to have to buy the ability to spawn a remote base and then equip that ability to actually use it. Now it appears as though you just have to unlock that ability. Press 'B' to deploy remote base in sunderer (or whatever key yours is bound to). Documentation/help in the game doesn't appear to be of much use. So you can expect to spend some time outside the game looking up certain things to figure them out or playing with them in game to learn by trial-and-error. Mostly, however, things are fairly common sense. Don't forget to look into customizing every little thing on your vehicles, weaponry, and gear to whatever you want them to be useful for. For example, the sniper's cloak can be either good for motionless use and sniping in between uses, or it can be configured to focus on stalking your prey--remaining invisible while moving in short distances, but at the cost of not being able to equip your sniper rifle.\n\nTwo Final Notes:\n\n1. I almost forgot. ALSO, there's a player studio now in effect for SOE games. You make something for players to use and submit it for review. If it gets put in the store, you get a cut of all profits from the sale of that item. I think the percentage is 40% of the take. But if you have the necessary skills and don't mind conforming to their design/style guide, might be a good way to pay for your gear and get your work out there in front of the public. I'm not sure if they pay you cash or just station cash, but either way it's not bad for those who can and want to do it.\n\n2. My advice to you, which I wish someone had told me, upgrade/improve/replace your secondary weapon since that affects all of your classes. No thanks is necessary.","June 11, 2014","true","88.5"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","1"

Maybe you come to realize that you are one of the guys in purple spandex, or that you are one of the Terran nut jobs, or even possibly the shot gun happy hillbillies. Coming to the realization of what team you're on now you need to figure out why every god dang time you set foot out in the open you are either shot, sniped, ran over, or just blown up.\nWith all the random senseless killing that feels as if it always favors you over everyone else, it's hard to understand why anyone woud play this game. And it's true, every time you step out of your giant bubble of a base you are now a walking target. Now it may seem unfair saying that you are a target ONLY by your enemy's standards. It would be far more realistic to say that you are technically a target  at all times (proof being that out of the 1000 deaths, a rounded off number of my deaths at one point, 100 of them were from my own team killing me). And yes, soak that in, there is god dang friendly fire. That means every time some guy hops in a plane, and by the way flying in this is very freaking hard, and decides to go all crazy thinking going upside down was a good idea he will come crashing down into whoever is on the ground. Now if the main explosion didn't kill you maybe the aftermath of the flaming parts will land on you, leaving you one of the many corpses on the ground. But it gets better... Because you may be thinking that if flying is that hard maybe that means the sky's will be clear most of the time. WRONG. Because for every game mechanic that feels impossible, there is some guy that for some god forsaken reason turns out to be MLG pro and literally takes control of the whole god dang sky.\nSo ya next point I'll bring out is that under all this random chaos there is actually a decent amount of organization. Crazy as it may seem there is actually outfits (clans/teams) that are capable of swinging the battle into their faction's favor. There has been times that I felt that my friends and I made that small decision that aloud our team to press forward, and that is one stinking good feeling. But imagine being part of a outfit that is organized and has 48+ people under command of one guy. Because this game is all about teamwork they will always trump any squad (smaller team of 2-12 people) and start to control the game. And that's exactly why if you get even slightly serious about playing this game you should consider joining an outfit, or at the least joining the open squads to be part of the giant zerg pushes.\nBut all in all this is a very interesting game. If you have the patience to learn the ropes I'm sure you'll come to the same realization that most people do, this is actually not just an interesting game, it's a great game. 9/10","August 2, 2014","true","401.7"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"

You rarely get the chance to learn how to play or to get in on the action because the enemy has supped up weapons, and your team does. So you just play support for them or act as their photographer.\n\nThe battlefield progression might aswell be arenas like other FPS games, because rarely do you see mass flanking tactics which could outscale waht you'd say in even older games like Battlefield1942. The battles themselves are usually repetive, though sometimes interesting, but never really satisfying. In addition to my game time here, which is fairly light, I did play in beta some.  There is some potential for you to get in with good, coordinated teams, but its not really a trend.\n\nMost battles seem to turn into shooting at the enemy who hides behind their spawn room lockout doors, or turtling behind berms. Tanks are as flimsy as infantry, because weapons are more rock paper scissors than actually letting vehicles have some durability. That is to say, even though I'm in a tank, all vehicle weapons shred tanks. Forget about actually using tank tactics, because the game is balanced for shooting from range, which makes little sense.\n\nAircraft are fun; I have no real complaints. They take some getting used to, but thats expected.\n\nThere doesn't seem to be a lot of social potential in the form of sharing. You can let your friend hop on your beefed up turret and rack up the kills (realising how imbalanced upgrades are), and that's it. You can't lend them a weapon or distribute power to them in any other way afaik. Squad play without someone you know or who has a mic seems isolated unless you're on their turret, but then when they die you'll generally lose them again and not meet under the same circumstaces.\n\nAll in all, its an interesting idea. But its less than fantastic execution reveals why it uses a F2P model.","June 8, 2014","false","6.2"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"

This is the sequel, with flashier graphics (it can be extremely beautiful at times, especially at sunrise or at night) and a revamped XP and upgrade system. It's free-to-play, but never pay-to-win, but it is hard to resist buying some Sony Station Cash to get cooler helmets and more camouflage options. Nevertheless, this is a game that does F2P right, as you get the entire game and everything in it for free in the first place, with the exception of a few "sidegrade" guns, which you can buy with in-game money anyway.\n\nPlanetside is back, better than ever, and I can't stop playing.

It's very difficult to pull off a MMOFPS like this well, and unfortunately Daybreak falls somewhat short of the bar. In short, this game is ahead of its time. The graphics and sheer amount of activity (there's several hundred players on a given continent at any time, and each continent is similar in size to the Oblivion world) cause many players to be forced to play at minimum resolution and graphics settings, which for an FPS is detrimental because it becomes difficult to aim at distant targets. In addition, the servers frequently lag, you rarely feel as though you're accomplishing anything, and battles for control of an area (especially biospheres and tech centers) can take hours. There are no "bot games" to play to get used to things- you are given a basic controls tutorial for your chosen faction and then dumped into the game immediately. For new players, this can be incredibly overwhelming. Throw in the fact that colors are somewhat muted and NC and TR armor looks similar at a distance, as well as friendly fire being on, and you get a huge clusterâ¥â¥â¥â¥ everywhere there's fighting. It's hard to tell if you're "winning", because there's no objectives other than "capture this area" which can be completed by any faction at any time, provided an area is adjacent to one of their controlled areas. In summary: Too graphics intensive for most players, no sense of accomplishment, no adequate preparation for newbies, and no clear objectives other than "kill everything that moves that isn't [insert team color here].","December 9, 2015","false","48.2"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","10","15","2","1"

The Gameplay of Planetside 2 Varies. sometimes the map will be filled with small skirmishes over key areas. other times massive armies will attack for a large command post. Now, because Planetside 2 is a "free to play" game you might be wondering if the Paying players get an advantage. the answer would yes and no. Yes because paying players can get guns,armor, and upgrades faster, No because they don't get any Paid-only weapons. for example they can't drop $20/$30 and get some massively overpowered gun that is only for them.\n\nPlayers in Planetside 2 can choose from SIX classes. Light Assault,Heavy Assault,Combat Medic,Sniper,engineer, and Mech Suit. Planetside 2 is meant to be a tactics game, and i've had the most fun while storming massive strongholds with an organised unit. In Planetside 2 instead of Clans you have Outfits. now you can join a platoon without being in that Outfit, but joining one lets you quickly find them when they are online.\nVisual-wise Planetside 2 is great, Textures are High-Res, Shadows are soft and lighting is done just right. The best part is that it doesn't take too much GPU or CPU power. The not so great part is that it only runs in 32-bit mode.\n\nGameplay takes part on three massive open-world continents on the world Auraxis. the three continents you fight on are Indar,Esamir, and Amerish. each map has its own theme. one is icy and cold, another is warm and wet, and the last is a dry arid wasteland.\nThe servers are normally lag-free, I've played at least 15 hours and I can only remember lagging out four times, and that was when I was in a 200+ person battle. one bad note is that newcomers will have a hard time fighting all of other leveled up players. but this just means the noobs should team up with the veterans and provide support, like a playing as a sniper,Medic, or Engineer. another bad thing is something that is the fault of the player base, and that is that most players DON'T want to team up and listen to orders they just want to run around like in Call Of Duty shooting people in little killing sprees. thats not how this game works. and if you try to play it like Call Of Duty all you will do is end up killing yourself and hampering your teams attempt to win.\n\nThe only thing i can really say i wished the game had was a story line, maybe a co-op campaign. it just seems to be such a waste to never use all of the epic background the devs put into the factions and areas. i guess that's asking too much for a MMO. Anyways, Check Planetside 2 out, its free,its fun, and its on steam.\n","March 23, 2014","true","81.6"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","12","19","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kinsmarck/recommended/218230/","Kinsmarck","Kinsmarck","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kinsmarck/","244 products in account","I just reinstalled and retried Planetside 2 for the first time since it came out, and I can say with unwavering certainty that itâs one of the very worst new player experiences Iâve ever had with a game.  It was mesmerizingly terrible at giving a positive first impression.\n\n- Despite having just installed what one should reasonably assume was the latest version via Steam, the game still required a lengthy patching process from its own launcher upon startup, as well as a third party registration, without the ability to sync with my Steam account.\n\n- The tutorial is stretched over a needlessly expansive area, and the narratorâs lines frequently bleed into and play over one another if one moves along ahead of the plodding pace it wants one to.  Needless to say, this renders any help such lines could lend incomprehensible and therefore useless, leaving one to flail about and learn through trial and error, rather than instruction, instead.\n\n- The very first thing I experienced upon connecting to an Instant Action is getting spawn killed with an airstrike not one second after setting foot on the ground.  Fan-â¥â¥â¥â¥ing-tastic.\n\n- The UI is one of the very worst Iâve ever encountered in terms of giving mechanical information to new players.  I know it shows information on controlled areas, flashpoints, how many friendlies and hostiles are detected in an area, etc, and thatâs all nice; however, there are some much more practical questions it seems intent on not answering.  Where can I spawn?  How can I change respawn locations?  Why, when I attempt to decipher the help menu tooltips for the map, and find that I must use warp facilities to change spawn regions, am I greeted with an insta-death ârestricted areaâ message upon attempting to reach one of those facilities?  Who knows!  Iâm just constantly told to click the âInstant Actionâ tab, and let the game carry me off to wherever it thinks Iâm needed, regardless of whether I want that region or not.\n\n- When I attempted to ask other players in the game chat for clarification during the respawn interim of yet another spawn kill, I was greeted with the following automated message: âThe dead canât speak.â  I actually uttered an âare you â¥â¥â¥â¥ing kidding me?â aloud in my office at this point.\n\nI know Planetside 2 is a well-respected game, and Iâm sure, once one is familiar with it, that thereâs some reason for that.  This isnât about that.  This isnât a comprehensive review, nor is it a commentary upon the overall quality of the game. This is simply a commentary regarding the initial impression its current version gives to new, uninitiated players.  The short version is this: I felt unwelcome, not by the players, not by my squad, not by my faction, but by the game itself, as a newcomer to Planetside 2.  At every turn, it seemed as though I was getting punished for not knowing things that a proper tutorial should have taught me, for not realizing the answers to questions I didnât realize I even needed to ask.  It felt as if it were deliberately obfuscating critical information that it just expected me to know without proper instruction.\n\nIâll make this as clear as I can: My initial impressions of Planetside 2 were so negative that Iâve no desire to learn the lessons necessary to further understand the game.  Iâm sure the answers are there.  Iâm just left with such a poor impression of my experience that Iâve no inclination to pursue them.

The developers let you try all the weapons and gear before you're ready to spend your certs on them.

Due to the steam version only being playable in the US I had to download an EU version elsewhere. I now have at least 200 hours play time on this game. This is definitely one of the best MMOFPS games out there. There is so much to this game that it is impossible not to find something to suit you. However one downpoint to the game that put me off was that even though it is free to play, it's pay to win. At least half of your deaths will be to a player who has spent a ton of money on the best weapons ect. Now when I say that it isn't as bad as it seems as all purchasable items can be earned by free to play players but it takes a lot longer. The graphics, size and gameplay easily make up for this.\n\nTL;DR\nIf you were looking for a new FPS game that is massive, provides hours of fun and is no cost to you, then look no further than Planetside 2. This game definitely deserves a thumbs-up.","July 10, 2014","true","1.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Why?\n1) It is very unique in way that it puts about 200 people of 3 fractions againts each other on a enormous map, it's a very interesting experience.\n2) It's a FTP (free-to-play) game and it's also kinda PTW (pay-to-win) game, but not as bad as few other FTP games, mostly because you won't really invest it in weaponry, but you'll kick it in customization and cool stuff like "Firework Gun".\n3) It has very good gaming community, there are not many noobs, campers and such. It's filled with standard gamers, which is very important part about this game.\n\n\n\nI hope my comment to this game "Planet Side 2" was somehow usefull, if you think I was wrong at some point please contact me.

Organized mess with about 100 guys fighting over a base, trying to capture it. 20 tanks, 10 jets and 50 armed men on foot. just wow. 3 factions, each with its own indivudal playstyle, weapons, vehicles. Some faction may have better vehicles than others but on the other hand they can lack on the force of their infantry weapons so there is always a balance and you can play faction which you like, not just which is strong. Some people may not trust F2P games, but this example of the perfect F2P game. microtransactions are not needed, shop offers comsetic items, xp and ingame currency boosters and weapons which you can all unlock with ingame currency. This game has a really neat ingame currency system- each 250 xp you gain 1 Cert point (ingame currency). This means the better you play the more money you will have.And theres a lot of opportunities to earn money- killing, assisting, spotting, damaging vehicles, airplanes, killing at longe range, objective capturing and the list goes on and on. It may be a grind but once you will learn to be most effective at the certain situation money should not be a problem.\nComunnity of this game is for me as a lone wolf player somewhat between ok and nice- you can and you will occasionally kill someone on your side, but thats not a problem, just apologise and everything is ok, most people even dont bother with it.\nNo frequent insults and ***holes as far in my 450 hours journey, so thats nice I think.\n\n\nPros\n-Massive scale of maps, battles and continents\n-Nice graphics\n-3 factions with its own playstyle\n-Great community\n-No need to spend real money\n-Sony sometimes gives away promo codes for free weapons, boosts, etc..\n\nCons\n-The game is very greedy, so its possible that people with not so good PC wont be able to play it\n-The ingame currency may have slower income for novice players\n-Sometimes very time consuming as you cant afford to take a dump when there is a huge battle and every single man counts.\n\n10/10\n","August 2, 2014","true","15.3"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","3"

Your warzone is an epic landscape dotted with forts, mountains, canyons and outposts, each of which is constantly changing hands. Your travel includes tanks, hover tanks, planes, transport planes, and more. Your tactics are myriad, and can be done independently or in squads. Will you cloak as an infiltrator and do some forward recon (which really is useful, as unless spotted, you have no idea where your enemy is, and although not quite at real life, bullets still kill pretty fast). WIll you hold a shield line with dozens of other brother and sibling soldiers against a massed charge? Will you perform harrying attacks, leaping and jettting around as a light assault soldier to flank a larger foe before zooming back into safety?

This is the worst part of the game.\n- LAG IS REAL sometimes.\n- Random kids are everywhere with friendly fire.\n- Solo gameplay is not rewarding and boring after a while.\n- You'll have to play hundreds of hours to be able to unlock those special equipments you want.\n- Competing with high lvl players is frusturating when you first start the game.\n- there's a learning curve for every class, gun and vehicle in the game. Can be confusing without proper equipment.\n- it takes a while to be actually usefull in the battlefield.\n- some weapons are poorly balanced and very expensive (thankfully you can test them before buying)\n- Air combat mechanics is not satisfying despite being so fun. It's just so hard.\n- Other than world events, there are no actual quests in the game. Ghost capping is your best bet at this point\n- No story or plot what so ever. (not that it needs to but still...)\n- You'll have to maintain your connection for 2 hours to benefit post world event rewards or else you'll just lose 2 hours with one little disconnect.\n- So much time consuming and so little rewarding sometimes. you won't believe your eyes.\n- so many different enemy player skins can actually trick you as friendly. and some players are headless(?!?) somehow.\n- microphone problems which they should have fixed by now.\n\nall in all fun.

I stopped playing about 3 months since March 2014 and came back during the Hossin Continent update, in hopes of a more fun and balanced gameplay. But it dissapointed me on so many levels. I was rusty when I came back but none the less I still remember the core mechanics and how to point and shoot. I played a few hours and died a lot, but its was to be expected after 3 months of leaving the game. About 15 hours in and not only my PPH (points per hour) was still drop to a measely 500/hr but my kill death ratio per game was more or less 0.2 to 0.1, not that I'm complaining since I'm an objective based player, but there is a lot of scenarios that I would have gotten a kill and survived with heavy injuries, but still alive before this update rolled out.\n\nThe changes are noticeble, infantry shield and hp was lowered , especially noticeble on the MAX suits , weapon damage was also changed for some of them. Some of the utility or special abilities of the class was changed in term of drain/ cooldown/ effect/ power , making a significant improvement in 1 of the classes but a significant drawback for the other. Graphics wise, it still looks the same but something has been change and is eating up my pc's power. Vehicles have been change as well and their weapons as well, mostly buffed. The point system is overall the same , that or slightly better. The deathcam has been improve I guess , but only slightly. The Hossin map is still under testing phase so the constant infantry and vehicles stuck are neglible and the map itself is good , thought that area lacks people playing. The teamwork of the game have mostly been lost , and objective based gameplay is pretty non-existent , most players now just care about their kill death ratio. The factions itself is now very unbalnced as well , it was about 30% TR , 30% NC , 40% VS when I last played , now its around 60% TR 30% NC and 10% VS. Now right now I maybe sound like some VS supporter, but mind you I play as all 3 factions and my favourite is TR because of their increased firerate and magazine size. But now the factions dominance is so unbalanced it's almost impossible for other minority to recover some of their bases. TR can fight on 3 front of the continent and win 2 of them, while the rest fight on the remaining continent barely making progress. As usual SOE still kept their currency at a decent price not too high and not too low. But the charge for most of the in game item is still expensive and the progress of getting cert ( the games earnable currency ) is still very bad grinding no matter how good you are.\n\nThis is what gets me now, for all games I review based on 10 main things, the New user experience, the casual player experience, the experienced player experience, music , art style (or graphics) , price ( in this case in game microtransation items ) , progress (if the game has any) , its main theme ( multiplayer , single player , story telling , etc ) , its community , and  last but not least , the MOST important thing for games, whether you are satisfied playing the game or completely hated it or mutual ( short version : fun or not).\n\nNew user (1 to 10 lvls) : Worst than before, the shield and hp system is very weak for the new user and hence they will die a lot faster and their starter weapons are not as good as they used to be.\n\nCasual players (5 to 40 lvls) : Overall not much has changed based on what I seen , you can play normally without getting 1 shotted most of the time and an advantage will normally guarantee your 1v1 scenarios.\n\nExperience players (41 and beyond) : Pretty much has all the infantry stuff mastered (not sure about vehicles ecause gameplay choices) , has very good gear that can overpower most low level enemy players and a very upgrade suit.\n\nMusic : Hasnt changed from what Iheard from the 3 factions, them songs is still the same I believe with TR a bit sadistic , VS and bit weird and alien like, and NC as um... western texas type of music. Weapons sounds have been change and is sounds much better now.\n\nGraphics : No comment other than cant see cloaked inflitators while using low settings.\n\nPrice : Free but in game microtransactions are a tad bit high\n\nProgress : Utterly slow at all levels unless you become a member, then you have a score system that actually means nothing when you think about it, cert gain is a pain as mentioned before ( exp 30 certs for a scope and 250 score pts to get 1 cert pts, so around 7500 score points to get just 1 scope) as for weapons, even longer as anyone would expect.\n\nMain theme : It should be a competitive multiplayer on a very very very large scale. It does that well at the start but because of the unbalnced faction, its not like that anymore, you either win or lose with a landslide on the normal to large scale battles (not accounting for the 4v4 base atk and def, cuz that's not large scale :P)\n\nCommunity : I chatted with the players in game, allies and enemies, visited the forums, overall quite good for a shooter, much much better than Call of Duty's community.\n\nFun or not: As of the Hossin update no, unless you are leveled with decent suit upgrades and weapons, new users will get destroyed no matter what, even then the unbalanced faction wars couple with slow progress makkes the game a pain to play, statistically the weapons arent overpowered when compared with the dafault ones, but when you play, you will notice that its very different in comparison. For the paid or the one with the heart  to grind throught everything, its an enjoyable experience. At the based level we all deserve a free to play game that is fun right from the start, not after paying over 60USD or grinding 800 hours into the game.\n\nSerious Score: 47. 67 % (Note: decimals dont mean anything)\nNormal Score: 63. 54 % dropped as of Hossin Update","July 24, 2014","false","104.9"," 16 of 28 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","16","28","0","1"

This is truly a massive game. Massive amounts of players fight on massive maps. There is definitely a "wow" factor, especially when you first join.\n\nAll I can really say is that this is a very strategic game, but there is also room for mindless shooting if that's what you're into. Other than that, there isn't much else to say that isn't in the description.\n\nOne dislike, though. The game sometimes feels like it should still be in beta, both glitch-wise and content-wise.

This is truly a massive game. Massive amounts of players fight on massive maps.

But it is still a game for a lot of people. For this game you sometimes need patience because not all battles are great. there is a lot of zerg-crushing and being zerg-crushed.\nBUT if you find the right battle (which isn't always hard) the game shines. During afternoon, after schools are out and in the evening these awesome battles will increase because of more players on the server, and when two zerg-crushes collide there comes a battle that is just awesome to to take part in.\n\nThe game works with two currency's (not sure if i can call it a currency) called certification points (cert points) and station cash. you have to pay real money for station cash and just play for cert points.\nWhile you can buy guns and attachments with station cash this game is (in my eyes) NOT a pay to win game. The guns and attachments can be bought with cert points too and the guns will help for sure but you still need skill and allies for victory. Upgrades for vehicles and your soldier can only be purchased with cert points.\n\nI play the game on low graphics, but the game can look pretty good on higher settings, and the maps are quite big and well thought out. Though sometimes its hard to get to a good fight it can be very worth your time and effort to get there. There are occasional crashes I usually get like one sometimes two per session i play, but since most battle take a long time i'm back in time to still partake in the battle.\n\nI myself love to play this game because through some of the bad things like zerg-crushing, spawn camping and crashes there is always a time a good battle arises.","July 14, 2014","true","540.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This game, however, takes it to a whole new level with 3 warring factions trying to gain supreme control over 4 seperate, massive continents.  Yeah, CONTINENTS.  Not maps... freaking, giant continents.  CS:GO, Battlefield, Call of Duty simply do not compare to the scale of warfarfe presented in PlanetSide 2.\n\nDay one, I spawned in a teleporter... or incubation tube (not really sure on that), and ran out the forceshield door into brillant and beautifully rendered warfare.  I was awestruck at its complexity, scale, and momentum.  I was so awestruck that a sniper killed me... that's ok; time to respawn and go kill a sniper.  Which I did.  Vengence was mine, but I digress.  I took my moment of victory on the mountaintop to look at the field before me.  I saw gunships and Batwing looking jets performing a praticed death dance in the sky.  Tanks, APCs, jeeps, & ATVs were swarming the ground lending their barrage to the base in a sci-fi only version of shock and awe.  Troops were swarming like ants towards the base.  Light infantry using jump jets were taking the parapets above, raining small arms fire down into the interior courtyard of the base.  Heavy infantry, MAXes (infantry in armored suit), medics and engineers were pouring into every openning in the base.  People were dying...\n\nTime to switch to a medic!  Next thing I know, I'm at that base.  Gunfire flying by, explosions all around, and a fallen teammate at my feet.  Don't worry buddy, I'm a medic.  I'll heal you.  I rez him like a pro.  Dagnabit! Someone killed me! Ah, sweet bright light, I'll come towards you.  Wait... that's a medical tool, I'm being rezzed!  Back in the fight!  The impromptu teammate seems to coalesce from nowhere.  Those on your own faction tend to help you whenever they can. Need a ride?  Someone stops to pick you up.  Need repair?  An engineer appears from nowhere to help.  It just happens.  Maybe by design, maybe because everyone realizes that helping you helps them.  I don't know, but it's exactly what should happen.\n\nWhat something a bit more?  Join an outfit, make friends, blow stuff up together.  PlanetSide 2 is a definate 9/10.

As a free player you will have access to all areas from the beginning, so the progression is all about cool new unlocks and customisation (cosmetics & builds).\n\nOne good way to start is to say that it's BIG, and I don't necessarily mean a big map-size (though it doesnt disappoint there either), but more along the lines of a threeway mega multiplayer, with multi-role vehicles and combined arms gameplay. All on an alien world (check out the Hossin continent, I love it!)\n\nThe gunplay (real gunplay, not the usual MMO junk) is more like that in the older Battlefield games, you will have to shoot more bullets to get the kill due to personal shields (ala Halo) on all classes. Which is a good since you are going to get shot at a lot :)\n\nI love the Sciency (that's a word) future weapons, the three distinct factions, and the small tactical fights spread out within the ridiculously large strategic battles. If you like shooters you will find something to love here, guaranteed.\n\nThe payment model is similar to the one used by League of Legends, in that paying money wont give you any competitive advantage ever. Cosmetics and Weapons can be bought, where the weapons arent straight upgrades but alternative 'sidegrades'. Subsription nets you big XP bonuses, some monthly unlock credits, and access to new stuff (cosmetics only) before anyone else.\n\nNOTE: the default weapons are designed to be the most balanced and flexible in line with your faction's philosophy. If you died to someone at a higher rank, it is because you are a worse player. Repeat there IS NO PAY TO WIN in this game.\n\nThe few cons are; that hey its a high end game, you are going to need a really good rig to keep your fps up in the larger battles, and that there is very little hand-holding. Jump on, make friends, squad up, pick your own fights. I hear a lot of people wander around aimlessly wondering what to do - don't be one of those people, it's a game that rewards a little thinking (especially for a beginner) massively.\n\n\nCome join me on the Miller server (RIP Woodman :s ) and fight under the banner of the Terran Republic!","December 15, 2012","true","447.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's an open world FPS with four continents: Indar,Esamir,Amerish and the newest one, Hossin. Each of them are incredible huge and can fit hundreds upon hundreds of players. There are six classes in total:\n\nLight Assault: your standard assault trooper but with a jetpack, so you can easily get to place to place.\nHeavy Assault: Heavy assaults have the 2nd strongest weapons and carry a bazooka with them.\nEngineer: Engineer is one of the most important classes. engineers can repair vehicles, set up turrets, repair MAX units, and give other players ammo.\nCombat Medic: Combat medics heal other troops and revive them, though they cannot heal a MAX unit\nInfiltrator: The Sniper, but he can also turn invisible and hack vehicle terminals. Last, but definitly not least\nMAX: The MAX unit is a mech unit and is the strongest in the game, it's normal bullets have the power to take out tanks, but like I said earlier, then can only be healed by engineers.\n\nNow on to the factions and their benefits:\n\nTerran Republic: The Terran republic are the ones who originally governed Auraxis, the planet you play on. They are authoritative, and conservitist. Their weapons fire incredibly fast, but fairly low damage. Their unique vehicles are the prowler and the mantis.\n\nNew Conglomerate: The New Conglomerate are a rebel faction who wish independance from the Terran Republic. their weapons are the strongest in the game but have incredibly high recoil. Their unique vehicles are the vangaurd and the reaver.\n\nVanu Sovereignty: The Vanu Sovereignty use technology found from aliens known as the Vanu. They believe that humanity can only evolve through this technology. they have fast bullets, no bullet-drop and low reload speed. Their unique vehicles are the magrider and the sycthe.\n\nthere are many vehicles in Planetside 2,\n\nFlash, An ATM that can be equiped with a weapon, they are fast but not really a good vehicle in comabt\nHerasser: The Herasser is more of a car, but still not the best in combat\nLightning: The lightning is a tank, good in combat and one of the most used vehicles.\nSunderer: the most useful land vehicle, this vehicle is slow, but when deployed it is used as a spawn point and you can get ammo from there. It is also used for transport as it can fit an entire squad (12 people)\n\nAir vehicles:\n\nLiberator: a fairly small air vehicle, it is great for attacking land units.\nGalaxy: The Galaxy is a huge air vehicle that is used for transport and can also be used as a spawn point.\n\nThe goal of the game is to capture points in the continents, there are outposts, bio labs, and other kinds are points.\nYou can go lone wolf, traveling to places where there is a lot of combat, or join a squad or platoon or better yet, an outfit. An outfit is what you would call a guild in MMO's. An oufit will usually have a lot of players, and a lot of them pros depending on what outfit. Outfits usually have events are depending on how large it is, a lot of platoons. Joining a good outfit will give you a great experience.\n\nThis is a fantastic game, incredible large, action packed and not even team-based, but army-based. I highly recommend it to everyone who enjoys FPS and open-world games.","July 6, 2014","true","49.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","2"

BF3 is good for what it is; the destructibility is impressive, the shooting is solid. But the sheer scale of PS2 has yielded more "Battlefield" moments in my few days playing than an entire year of BF3. Aesthetically, it's even got that 2142 vibe in a lot of respects. Add twelve-person squads, in-game clan functionality and VOIP to its ridiculous player count and this honestly feels like the Battlefield 3 I was hoping for. Unlike that game, which included hardly any of its predecessor's most progressive features, PS2 provides a sprawling sandbox with an array of tools that--when used correctly or at all--help focus the experience appropriately.\n\nAnd TBH, BF4 is just more BF3 -- not much of an levolution at all.","December 7, 2012","true","137.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

As a free player you will have access to all areas from the beginning, so the progression is all about cool new unlocks and customisation (cosmetics & builds).\n\nOne good way to start is to say that it's BIG, and I don't necessarily mean a big map-size (though it doesnt disappoint there either), but more along the lines of a threeway mega multiplayer, with multi-role vehicles and combined arms gameplay. All on an alien world (check out the Hossin continent, I love it!)\n\nThe gunplay (real gunplay, not the usual MMO junk) is more like that in the older Battlefield games, you will have to shoot more bullets to get the kill due to personal shields (ala Halo) on all classes. Which is a good since you are going to get shot at a lot :)\n\nI love the Sciency (that's a word) future weapons, the three distinct factions, and the small tactical fights spread out within the ridiculously large strategic battles. If you like shooters you will find something to love here, guaranteed.\n\nThe payment model is similar to the one used by League of Legends, in that paying money wont give you any competitive advantage ever. Cosmetics and Weapons can be bought, where the weapons arent straight upgrades but alternative 'sidegrades'. Subsription nets you big XP bonuses, some monthly unlock credits, and access to new stuff (cosmetics only) before anyone else.\n\nNOTE: the default weapons are designed to be the most balanced and flexible in line with your faction's philosophy. If you died to someone at a higher rank, it is because you are a worse player. Repeat there IS NO PAY TO WIN in this game.\n\nThe few cons are; that hey its a high end game, you are going to need a really good rig to keep your fps up in the larger battles, and that there is very little hand-holding. Jump on, make friends, squad up, pick your own fights. I hear a lot of people wander around aimlessly wondering what to do - don't be one of those people, it's a game that rewards a little thinking (especially for a beginner) massively.\n\n\nCome join me on the Miller server (RIP Woodman :s ) and fight under the banner of the Terran Republic!","December 15, 2012","true","447.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Yes, it has enormous battles between multiple platoons all at once.  Indeed, I offen feal that those are the battles that keep me playing hoping that the next time i log in will be the next big one and all the little battles in-between almost feal like the warmup to the next.\nSo, thats what I will talk about.  The little battles.  But first.\nBugs, glitches?  Yes we have them, especially after the game gets updated again.  Witch happes a lot, though most of them will be sorted out within a week...most of the time.....\nLag? Again yes we have that.  Up to 2000 people per map and/or 200 people per side in a three way battle on a piece of land about a mile or two square?  Hit Alt + F and you can literally watch your FPS drop.\nWitch in turn leads back to the small battles.  Less people, higher FPS and offen a more personal feal to the fights, especially if you have a working mic or at least have mics turned on so you can hear what those with are saying (unlike some games our chat isn't full of pre-teens swearing their heads off.  Don't get me worng, we have some of them as well, but for the most part their few and far between).  Or mabe you found an enemy bace with no one home and decided to go for whats called a 'ghost cap' and then some one turns up to flush you out and it becomes a fun little 1v1 till some one kicks the other out.\nYes, this is a game about big, big battles.  But that doesn't mean you can find smaller ones to ether take a brake/work your way up to, the bigger ones.\nStill reading?  Really?  ....Um....ok....  Well if it is your first time heres two tips that the tutorial (for some odd and some what annoying reason).  First, infiltrators have a 'hack' ability you can use on terminals and turrets to turn them to your side, even when an enemy is in them in witch case they will be kicked out a few feet behind them, you also dont need to be always facing  the target solong as you keep holding the action butten for the hack, usefull for being ready to shoot the person that was in said turret.  Also the engineers placeable turret, if you hit "B" before you place it, it will deploy as an amo pack and you can have both the turret and it deployed at the same time. In short, there is no such thing as an engi without amo, just one that has yet to learn that trick.  Also there are very few times when you can't over come with skill what that other person got with certs and/or SC.  Play smart, win more.  Run about like a headless chicken, learn to enjoy getting killed, a lot.  So long as you don't go into this game thinking you're going to be "leet quick scoping them noobs" (or....how ever that sentence is ment to come out) you should be just fine in the long run.","June 1, 2014","true","175.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

First and foremost it is the sheer scale of it that is at times breathtaking. You can find yourself in battles with hundreds of players having at it at once over a base, and thousands in total battling it out over several persistent continents, huge maps that make battlefield seem like a 6v6 CS match in comparison in size.\n\nAnother thing about Planetside 2 is that it is the first really accessible game that features real coordination by its playerbase. join up with squads and platoons, and if it is lead by a competent leader it is better than anything else out there.","January 3, 2013","true","419.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It's strange in some way, due to the fact that I stick to my paid titles a lot more. Regardless, it's interesting to see what works and what doesn't.\n\nPlanetSide 2 has been talked about a lot, probably most notable example would be PC Gamer magazine. Even with that, it took me a while to even decide to pick it up and give it a shot. [Quick note, I don't endorse PC Gamer as a good source of balanced information regarding the game industry, but more of a bulletin for new things].\n\nI was pleased right off the bat from videos to see a high bar set on graphics, effects, and environmental scale. Even PhysX particles added more to the title.\n\nAfter acquiring the core content from Steam, I was a little struck to see a launcher and updater. While not a huge issue, as many other F2P titles on Steam do the same thing, but it's just more junk on the machine. Downloading through the launcher didn't take that long, and the main menu of sorts was presented to me. This is where things starts to get on loose ground.\n\nThe select a server process isn't what it should be. You create a character, decide on 1 of 3 sides, play a tutorial, and then you are let loose into the public game. Unknown to you is that that character has to stay on that server. If you want to hop on a server where your friend plays, you have to create a new character and start all over again. Certainly a bummer when "social play" is to be encouraged. Throw in a maximum of 3 characters, and you can see why this can be a pain.\n\nAnother let down has to be the PhysX particles. They were removed due to some "bugs", which I haven't been able to find the information release that explains who/what/where/when/why.\n\nInformation overload isn't a major problem with most modern FPS titles, but PlanetSide 2 really suffers in this regard. Displaying a "holographic" icon with varying colours isn't new, but with so many different icons, colours, and useless POIs being displayed instead of useful ones, it can give players headaches from the information overload or being unable to find key locations.\n\nViews inside vehicles is also something you have to be ready to deal with. Most FPS titles allow the player to move their camera any which way inside. PlanetSide 2 really clamps down on that, and when dealing with uneven terrain, you really miss being able to move it like most games.\n\n5th and probably most significant has to be the odd partitions of areas. While each environment (or planet) is large, a server may host 3 different areas which require a transition to. This segregation of areas just feels unnecessary and adds more hoops to go through.\n\n\nPlanetSide 2 gameplay feels like Tribes: Ascend with a optional jetpack and without the Ski mechanic, taking place on a larger battlefield where social play lacks. I would certainly give this a go, but you are not missing out on a major "ground breaking" game.\n\n7/10","February 1, 2014","true","7.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It's fun still despite the â¥â¥â¥â¥ storm that came, SOE, might be learning thier mistakes and getting thier â¥â¥â¥â¥ together. For now I will be recomending this game.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nI played over 1200 hours. The NC have gotten nerfs that are not even needed. For example, nerfed the time for the Vanguard shield being up. They decreased teh time from 8 secounds to 5 secounds. Was thayt needed? It's not even worth to get the thing anymore! I swear it's like they put up ideas on a wall and throw a dart with a blind fold to decide what needs to be "Balanced" and by balancing they nerf it. But does the vanu get nerfed? No... they are so biased for the vanu it's horrible. Do they fix they infinite afterburner glitch? No... who does this favor? Vanu Magriders. If the patch is buggy, please dont realise it. Oh and Hossen? Haha! They promised that twice and every time it was delayed. Hell They promised it a year ago? The game is a waste of time. I owned a outfit of 450+ members on Planetside 2: Mattherson server. I did amazing battles of orginzation. This was rare. Mostly it's zerging. Let me just say this game isnt worth your time and you shoudl play Planetside 1. That was when sony was a different company. When they wanted to make a game. Not money. Oh did I mention each gun is about $7? And cosmetics for your weapons and vehicals actually give away your position and make you MORE noticable? This game focused on making money! Not a game. Which I can understand, but please the game shoudl be a higher priority. Now they have signs saying "We're starving programmers, buy membership now!" Like hell I will! They are literally bankrupted on a spiraling downhill death of the game. They screwed up and they know this. They're milking whatever money they can before the game dies. Sony screwed up. SOE is going to die out, I will never play any of thier games because they are rushed out and poorly made, bad bugs, and only want your money they dont want to make a good game they can be proud of. And they are the WORST balancers ever. the buffs and nerfs are as wishy washy as a girl picking out cloths for Prom Night! Save your time and Go play Planetside 1 if you dare press "install" for Planetside 2. Or hell Play a different game. Like I've said I've put over 1200 hours in this game. Ran a Outfit of 450+. Organized with the NCC of Mattherson I was active, one of the Leaders of the Big platoons for alerts. I've told my officers that we were moving to War Thunder. If SOE fixes their ways then I will go back to PS2 in a heart beat.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/midnight357/recommended/218230/","midnight357","Midnight","http://steamcommunity.com/id/midnight357/","85 products in account","Nice concept, I really tried to like this game.. but I can't recommend it. Especially to new players.. since the experienced playerbase (and well armed, balance is a concern and weapons are NOT always sidegrades) will pound you to the ground at this point.\n\nThe gameplay itself is nice and smooth, but it all breaks down to one singular point: Numbers win. That is all and your contribution is completely pointless. Bigger numbers win ten times out of ten and you can do NOTHING about it as an individual. This makes sense, this is how war works and war isn't fair. Unfortunately, this is a video game and some balance has to be made.\n\nSo I'll sum up my everyday experience with PS 2. You log in, go into battle. One of 2 things happens.. either numbers are on your side, in which case you completely roll over enemy defences, often supported by vehicles that will be shelling the everliving â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of enemy base (spawn). So they can't even fight back. In this scenario you sit on the point and wait... maybe revive occasional fallen comrade on your side (if you're medic). Fun, fun, fun!\n\nOr.. you find yourself on the receiving end of the same thing. The moment you leave spawn you die to the bombing or the infantry that is camped around the spawn. Even if you manage to flank the enemy.. it's pointless. Maybe you take down a few.. there's still too many of them, you won't break the siege or anything. So you sit there frustrated or you leave for some other base, in which case you roll the dice again which scenario you end up in. Again, fun, fun, fun!\n\nIndividuals simply don't matter in this game. Progression is extremely slow with weapons being expensive and currency gain low. This is not such a problem for infantry as most weapon are usable one way or another. But the game changes when it comes to vehicles, some upgrades are absolutely ESSENTIAL to being effective in a vehicle. Until then you won't get far in a vehicle... so how do you earn currency to kit out your ride? Yep, back to the MEAT GRINDER. This game seriously reminds me of the movie Starship Troopes... scores of infantry sent to be slaughtered against even more numerous enemy. It would be almost poetic if it wasn't so bloody frustrating.\n\nAnyway, even when you manage to get that new shiny gun (after a looong time) it won't help you anyway when you are taking potshosts at the camping enemy from the spawn room. I tried changing tactics, changing classes, changing weapons.. nothing matters. No tactic, no class and no weapon will ever change anything.\n\nTB said this when he was talking about PS 2: "Planetside 2 is ultimately a game about logistics, not shooting." (Not verbatim). This is the most accurate descripiton of PS2 I've ever heard. You don't matter, noone does. It's about getting the masses to the right place and then completely overwhelming the enemy. Nothing else ever happens.. well, it does, but very very infrequently.\n\nSo if you want to play a shooter, go play something else. If you want to play logistics simulator, then PS2 is a game for you. Get people into it, make squands and platoons and shuffle them around on the virtual board. As an individual or, god forbid, soloist.. forget it.\n\nAnd then there's the f2p model, bugs, terrible optimization, lag and client issues (hit detection is â¥â¥â¥â¥ed sometimes)... oh and terrible design decisions.","September 17, 2014","false","106.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Just 1 of the 3 continents is larger than all the MW3 maps put together. The small skirmishes in this game tend to be 20 on 20, medium ones can easily be 50 plus. But where this game really shines is the big battles. Hundreds of people split up across 3 armies all fighting for control of the same zones with dozens of tanks and aircraft supporting them. If you are a lone wolf you will probably become easily bored, but if you enjoy team/squad based tactics there is nothing on the market that compares with PS2.\n\nThe big battles when you get lots of particle effects flying around can be a bit of a resource hog. You also want a broadband network connection, being a shooter latency is very important. The good news if you are unsure about what your system can run the game is F2P so there is no reason not to try it.\n\nThe one part we need to keep an eye on is the F2P element. While it is nice that anyone can try it time will tell if it becomes pay to win. So far it does not seem to do that. Mostly you buy XP boosts or cosmetic items. You can spend money on purchasing weapons also, so far there are not that many weapons to purchase and none of those that I have tried have been ridiculously overpowered. Most have trade offs like higher rate of fire but greater bullet spread. In the end they so far seem to balance themselves out.\n\nIn the end it is a great change of pace from most all modern shooters on the market. As someone who enjoys being another soldier instead of a 1 man army I find the team based game play to be amazing. If you have the machine to do it the graphics look amazing good at higher settings. The servers also seem to be well made, even in the largest of battles I do not experience any real lag. You will occasionally see the random guy blinking across the battlefield but that is them lagging not the server. I would give it 8.5 if I could but will go with an 8. It has room to improve but so far so good.","December 5, 2013","true","201.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

Games like Battlefield boast about their epic 64 player battles running smoothly, but Planetside blows this out of the water.\n\nBefore Planetside, I had always looked for an FPS that required teamwork and coordination to succeed. Other games may have had some level of this, but none surpassed the level needed to succeed in Planetside. It is not uncommon to find yourself in a platoon cooridinating with over 100 other players in a firefight against another 100 players.\n\nWhile Planetside may take some time to build up your character (unlocking equipment and vehicle upgrades etc) the time invested is definitely worth it in the long run if you plan on playing a lot. You will also need a decent computer and solid internet connection as well if you want to compete in the large battles.\n\nOverall, I definitely reccomend this game to anyone looking for an FPS that strays from the typical mutiplayer experience.","December 28, 2014","true","440.3"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","1"

As with most free to play models it has microtransactions to unlock stuff for real cash and considering it takes a long grind to unlock cert points (xp) it's essentially a pay to win game at times. To unlock a couple of decent attachments for weapons you had to put in a good few hours of playing, that was the downside. The game in it's self is fun when you get into a large skirmish fighting over a key area on the map against the other two enemy factions, these skirmishes could include armor fighting on the ground, spaceships fighting in the sky and infantry on ground, it's this madness that makes the game quite fun. The gunplay is ok at times alot of the guns feel the same more or less and even look very similar which after a grind of hours to earn xp and buy a new gun to find it wasnt worth the time. Overall you can't complain when somethings free but would still recommend it for a decent free to play. 7/10","December 1, 2012","true","89.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The three factions (despite the occasional discrepancy) are balanced in a very clever way that makes it so they have equal abilities but different specialities, without each faction seeming to be the same.\n\nBUT, the most outstanding aspect of this game is by far the dedicated moderators and developers, who are in-touch with the playerbase populace to the point of near-telepathy. They consistently make improvements, take criticisms/suggestions, and then incorporate solutions and new ideas into the game in later improvement patches. The Planetside 2 staff are definately on the ball, all the time, and rarely ever (if so, marginally) make mistakes.\n\nWhen you get on, just make sure to bring some friends, or make some while your there. It compounds the fun.\n\nCertainly well-worth your time. I highly doubt anyone would regret downloading this.

Get a Lasher, Hades, Nova, Ursa, Dalton,  Zephyr,  Sauron, Skyguard,  Walker, Fury's all around.  Armor camo, Vehicle camo, Weapon Camo, Composite Armor, Skull Helmets, and spend your certs on scopes and forward grips.

Though, it's a pain in the â¥â¥â¥ to get good weapones. And it takes time to learn the game, and you will be dying alot as a beginner, since there are those pay to win players that have overpowered weapones and some of them might have a bit of skill too, witch is quite a deadly combo. Though , as you progress through the game, you will get used to it and get better and better, earn certs and buy different items. I reccomend you to get weapones everyday with the trials, 30 mins per 8 hours seems quite ok to test a weapon on the field. Could be alot better, I am expecting some new types of gamplay, not just capturing all day, the same points, on the same maps. And it's not my job to tell you what to actually make =)\n\nPROS:\n\n+ You can test your weapones before you buy them, on the field !\n- Only once per a month for the same weapon, and for only 30 minutes.\n+ Good level design\n+ Great huge maps to play on\n+ Large battles\n+ Amazing tank fights\n+ Good air battles\n+ Good class variation , for diffrent types of playstiles\n+ Extraodrinary epic random player-generated fights\n+ Average experience in late game, repetitive and frustrating sometimes, though it could be alot worse, so I will put it on the 'bright' side\n\nCONS\n\n- Bad new-player experience\n- Very simple combat, not much variation here\n- Unbalanced factions\n- Average optimization\n- Unplayable as an NC newbie\n- Alot of pay to win aspects\n- Grinding takes too long ( it took me over 2 days to get a 250C rocket launcher, witch is not OK)\n\nOverall , I would give this game a 7 / 10 for it's epic battles.","February 3, 2015","true","74.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Well im here to tell you why this is THE best massive multiplayer game of this generation.\n\n*Note: This info comes from personal experience from multiple accounts for several years.What i write is the truth.That is it\n\n\nGeneral Information: SOE brags about planetside 2 has 2000 active players on EACH of the 4 servers,that would make 8000 people online,playing at once EVERY day. Now that is not true since both i and other people have claimed that it is 1500,also depending with holiday and day of the week it is,anyway it is still a hellova lot.\n\nTo begin with,the game goes thrue alot of hotfixes,so be ready for that.Server downtime is common but now an real issue.\nThe game is also a hackers hell,i have in all my years never met someone that used hacks,ever. So dont worrie about hacking in this game.\n\nGameplay: When you begin the game and create a character you choose a faction to fight for and a name. Also choose one of very few faces, so dont expect any change in character. Each faction has its own traits and specialisation. The Sovereign Nation Terran Republic wich is red and black dominate the infantry class while being in significant danger when facing new Conglomerate with armor,since they focus on pure damage and thereby dominate the tank and armor part of the game. The vanu sovereignty focus mostly on tech and have a advantage up in the air in form of air fighters.\nI seriusly recommend playing as TR since they focus on infantry and "brotherhood".You will never feel so close to a faction as you do in the TR.\n\nSpecs: The game runs pretty good actually, if you have better cpu:s then a regular laptop you can play this game on high graphics. But then again,you can only know when you try it.\n\nThe game is fairly balanced although the TR has pretty bad stock weapons and as said, VS has the air, NC has the armor and The Sovereign Nation of The Terran Republic has the infantry, wich is great. The game is in the greyzone of being P2W (Pay to win). You can buy weapons and armor/camo with real cash, although upgrades and certs cant be bought with real cash (wich also is great). But you can get alot more certs if you buy boosts so its kinda in the grey area. Certs are used to buy upgrades and attachments,wich actully is pretty varied in this game. There is a lot of weapons and you can switch turrets for vehicles in the game, if you are in a battle where alot of tanks and armor is involved,you can switch from the standard issue cannon on your tank to a AT (Anti-Tank) cannon,wich is one of the many comcos and turrets in this game.\n\nSince this is a massive multiplayer game,there are very few objectives,you basiclly defend or attack a base that is either very big and hard to defend/attack or very small and easy to attack/defend. This remains true for all the continents in the server. Btw there are 3 continents:\n1. Indar (sandy,large moutains and rough tarrain)\n2. Esamir (Icy, Large moutains)\n3. Amerish (Rainforest like? good sniper map)\n\nThis is a short review,any questions can be sent to me if you wish,or check the planetside 2 info here: http://www.planetside2.eu/pages/overview\n","March 13, 2014","true","358.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's possible to have a huge battle between 600 people (300 vs 300), if not more. There are 3 factions each one having its peaceful as well as broken views of the world. Their ideologies are perfectly balanced and in my opinion, no one is neither better nor worse than the others. The more thought is spend on choosing your faction, the more difficult it will seem to make your choice:\n\n-The Terran Republic (TR): The original empire from which people branched off and created the other 2 fronts. On one hand, they want to create peace through fighting, defeating and uniting everyone into one faction under its rule so everyone can equally share the resources of Auraxis. On the other hand, everyone under its reign must follow its ideology, so freedom of choice does not exist and people that are considered a threat are executed. (Peacemakers / Tyrants)\n\n-The New Conglomerate (NC): Freedom fighters originally fighting against the TR for their oppressive views, yet created from corporation leaders and is based on oligarchy. (Rebels / Mercenaries)\n\n-The Vanu Sovereignty (VS): Scientists that discovered alien technology and legitimately want to advance the human race, but at the cost of humanity itself (brainwashing, toying with unknown tech).\n(Scientists / Fanatics)\n\nIt is definately worth it if you're into these types of games. If you are feeling that your leadership or aiming skills go unacknowledged, don't worry. You can always join an outfit (clan) and play with your buddies. Unlike other games, voice chat communication is constant between leaders and squad members alike.\n\nAlso, not to mention that new features are constantly added to the game like cosmetic items, weapons and vehicles ;)","July 2, 2013","true","433.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Or that you feel that you are not really playing a very important role. Well not more! Planetside 2 is the successor of Planetside (a game I know nothing about). It combines fast-paced gameplay with a variety of classes. Instead of your normal small map Deathmatch, the map is F**KING HUGE! Seriously, you can get lost extremely easily. Now, you can still spend tons of time looking for something to kill, but that is overlooked thanks to Instant Action (a little feature that puts you in a very populated battle). There are 3 factions: The Red dudes with attitude (and bullets), the Blue rebels with tons of damn armor, and my personal favorite, the Purple men with PEW PEW laser guns. The classes include a sniper that can g invisible, a fast dude with a jetpack, a medic that is quite good at combat, an engie that can deploy a turret (TF2 much?), a guy like the fast dude, but with more armor, no jetpack, and a motherf**king rocketlauncher. Oh yeah, then there is the MAX, an overpowered fighting machine, aka the Heavy from TF2. The vehicles are cool, ranging from a little quad bike to giant transport ships. Overall, I quite like Planetside 2. Too bad not a lot of people play. I mean, ONLY 3,000 players on Steam??? Isn't this a MMOFPS?

From piloting, to driving, to infantry combat. I can confidently say that not even Call of Duty will ever come into comparison to the massive scale battles ive been with my clan. I am talking 700 People + pushes to territories, Along with the constant strategy needed and the inmersion including the many variable terrains that the several continents offer. I enjoy this game the most, its free to play, it has some pay to win aspects that arent too overpowered and a fine balance between pro's and whiners. I â¥â¥â¥â¥ING LOVE PLANETSIDE.

The light coming in the doors is too bright to see out and all i can see is white, with a faint reddish glow from the forcefeild keeping out enemy weapons fire. I don't know this battlefield or what weapons the enemy has access to, all i know is my team mates have a habit of getting shot. I walk over to the console in the corner and pull of my class section screen. i choose the medic, with it i am able to heal teammates and revive fallen comrades. Before i head outside i check the map, I'm in the North-East Corner of an outpost at the border between our 2 armies, theirs to the West, Ours to the East.\nI step outside to see snow, everything if cover in a layer of snow. My teammates are running though the outpost headed south, i quickly follow behind. We get near the edge of the buildings when i notice several bodies lying out in the open, and i notice too late the only living people are behind cover. Someone shouts "Snipers!". I die.\n\nI Spawn:\nI know my mistake. i quickly make my way back to the combat and hold to cover, i get lucky and catch a enemy off guard and take him down. Then i start my duties as a medic and start getting people back on their feet. I get a few up and back into the fight, get another kill, then i notice tanks coming up a path from the west. We dont want to admit it, but we're losing this fight. The tanks, along with the snipers covering them push us back slowly. the medics can't keep up with reviving the dead, and soon, they capture the control point for the Outpost, we have lost our re-spawn room.\n\nWe catch a break. Someone had the smart idea to acquire a Mobile Spawn station. It has been set-up behind a hill to the north of the outpost, about 50 yards away. The Enemy has movied into our hold base and we dont plan on going all the way home without a fight. the tanks move on use and are blasting at out Spawn "APC". We are about 30 strong, a few change to Engineers to keep our APC alive until we can kill the tank, 2 guy jump into MAX suits, suits of armor with heavy weapons, and a few change to the Heavy assault class for their rpg's.\nThe tanks go down, the APC is still standing, the engineers have set up Turrets at the top of the hill, snipers have moved up with them sending out pop-shots and Cloaking before the enemy returns fire, the Medics are staying low and keeping everyone standing.\n\nThis battle started at one end of the outpost and worked its way though to the other side. I take a step back and look at the new frontline's, and what i see before me looked like the the snow planet battle of the Empire strikes back.\n\nI kept thinking "where is the air support?". We were holding the line well, they had seemed to run out of tanks, and we had scouts trying to push the line back in. Then i heard the sound of the 6 rounds being unloaded all at once from a Lightning tank. It was one of ours, and it was beautiful. It was followed by 4 more tanks, they came from our rear, North-east by east, we had backup, and the Enemy line started to break.\nIt brought a tear to my Eye, i ran back to the APC and changed from my Medic gear to that of an Engineer, and then i ran after the advancing tanks to keep then it working order.\n\nI think someone Yelled something over the Mic in the distance, but i was deep with the roars of the tanks couldn't hear it. But I'm sure on what everyone else heard. "CHARGE!!"\n\n\nAnd this was only an hour of my day.","November 26, 2012","true","0.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Though on high settings or greater, you're going to be in for a treat with it's crisp and stunning visuals, like a rainbow threw up on Battlefield 3 and put the fight on an alien world.\n\nYou need to want to be a team player.  Your experience in this game will vary dramatically from enthralling and heartpounding to just plain frustrating and rage inducing, and the difference is teamwork.  Find an outfit (a guild) and communicate with them using the robust in-game voicechat.  Hop in a platoon and look for your leaders' waypoints.  Stick with your team and you'll have a ball.\n\nThe last thing you'll need is patience.  You're going to take a while to get used to the game and all of the systems in place.  Familiarize yourself with the map and the different functions around the bases.  Ask questions in voice-chat.  If you can find a friend that can help familiarize you with the icons around a base, they can get overwhelming.\n\nGood luck out there if you choose to play, it's a great game and even more incredible that they're offering it for free, and I'll say that the paid character cosmetic customizations are quite worth it, they certainly make you stand out without being obstructive.","November 22, 2012","true","674.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Her hair grew fast and thick and drew admiration everywhere she went. People who first met Melissa sometimes thought she was conceited about her beautiful tresses and overly concerned about how long her hair grew. Melissaâs friends knew better. They knew why Melissa cared that her hair grew long and thick.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nâWhat do you think?â Melissa asked her best friend Courtney who had come over to play on a rainy Saturday in April.\n\n\n\nâItâs just right,â Courtney said. Holding up the measuring tape she was using to check the length of Melissaâs hair.\n\n\n\nâWow,â Melissa exclaimed excitedly and she and Courtney ran to find her mother, the measuring tape streaming out behind them.\n\n\n\nâItâs long enough again, Mom!â Melissa told her mother breathlessly when she found her making cookies in the kitchen. âCan we do it now?â\n\n\n\nâRight now before the cookies are done?â Melissaâs mom laughed.\n\n\n\nâWell, I guess we can wait for a batch of chocolate chip cookies,â Melissa said as she and Courtney watched her mom drop spoonfuls of cookie dough on the baking sheet.\n\n\n\nâHow about in twenty minutes?â Her mom asked. âI should have everything cleaned up by then and it will give Dad a chance to get the camera ready.â The girls agreed heartily and ran off to Melissaâs room to wait impatiently.\n\n\n\n"They knew why Melissa cared that her hair grew long and thick."\n\n\n\n\n\nCourtney and Melissa had been halfheartedly playing a board game to pass the time, but abandoned it quickly when Melissaâs mother brought a plate of fresh cookies and two glasses of milk to Melissaâs room. They jumped to their feet.\n\n\n\nâNow?â Melissa asked looking expectantly at her mother.\n\n\n\nâYes, come downstairs as soon as you eat your cookies,â her mother told the two girls and left the room. Unable to wait, the two girls trailed after Melissaâs mother munching cookies along the way. Within minutes Melissa sat excitedly on a stool in the kitchen while her mother brushed her beautiful hair into a neat pony tail and secured it tightly with a rubber band.  Courtney stood close at hand as a helpful assistant, passing the measuring tape to Melissaâs mother. Carefully measuring off ten inches from the bottom edge of the pony tail to above the rubber band, Melissaâs mother marked the spot with a bobby pin.\n\n\n\nThe flash from a camera kept lighting the scene as Melissaâs dad shot pictures from every angle. Melissaâs mom accepted the scissorâs that Courtney held out to her, then carefully cut across Melissaâs hair above the pony tail along the bobby pinned mark. Dramatically, she handed the cut pony tail still tied with a rubber band to Melissa, and the room broke out with shouts of joy and excitement. Laughing and dancing from foot to foot, Melissa held her cut pony tail aloft, and with her arm around her best friend, posed for a few more pictures.\n\n\n\nStill breathless with excitement, Melissa ceremoniously curled her beautiful pony tail carefully into a plastic bag, and then eased it into a bubble wrap envelope. They penned the address on the outside, and slipped a completed form into the envelope. The sealing of the package received almost as much fanfare as the cutting and everyone cheered. All that remained was a visit to the post office to send the priceless package along its way with a tracking number to follow its progress and assure its safe arrival at its destination.\n\n\n\nAs Melissaâs mother trimmed Melissaâs much shorter beautiful blonde hair to even out the cut, she stopped and gave her a hug. âIâm very proud of you,â she spoke quietly to her daughter.\n\n\n\nMelissa K. donates her hair to a charity as often as it reaches ten inches, the minimum requirement for a useable donation. Her last hair cut marked the third time she had given her hair to the charity that makes prosthetic hair pieces for children with permanent hair loss. Everyone who knows about Melissaâs donations agree that Melissaâs giving spirit is as beautiful as her lovely hair.\n","August 23, 2014","true","123.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The reason I liked it above other Triple A titles, is that it has a more expansive map. The game is also heavy on the enviroment. Next to the otherwise beautiful landscapes, from desert like to jungle, the game has an added day/night cycle. This is a feature I've not seen in any Multiplayer FPS. Gameplaywise, the game feels like any shooter, but with the extended class customization the game does not feel like one weapon is the best.\n\nI also might add that the vehicles feel smooth to use. The fighter jets do what you want them to do. Vehicle combat feels as if you're the supportive brother, and not OP on any side.\n\nI give an advise to beginner players, players who aren't skilled enough and players who like to know their preferred class to use VR training, which gives you access to all equipment and training dummies, which is a great training.\n\nOne downside I found, is that the microtransactions brake the progress of your character a bit. But if you aren't into any special grinding, (which you do not have to be, because the standard weaponry work fine.), you almost do not notice it.\n\nI've not checked the friends and squads part of the game, but it looks very extensive.\n\nAll and all I would give this game a try. even the Tripple A fans.

The easiest comparison is with Battlefield. It's pretty much Battlefield in a Sci-Fi setting and HUUUUUGE! Each of the current four continents spans 64 square kilometers with many bases and outposts ranging from small forward outposts to large tech plants. Combine this with a unique look to each continent plus three factions longing for control over the territory, most of the time having two or more fronts to battle at, and very good game balancing and you get Planetside 2.\nThe only real downside to the game are the required system specs. The game is pretty performance-hungry, but the devs are working in improving the games performance constantly.\n\nIf you're not a Lone Wolf type of player you might want to grab some friends or find an outfit to roll with tho, because there's only so much you can do by yourself. Sometimes a coordinated air raid or tank convoy is the thing you need and you can't do this as effectively when you're alone.","September 2, 2014","true","486.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bombzero/recommended/218230/","bombzero","Bombzero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bombzero/","161 products in account","Planetside 2 is... in simple terms, a very solid and entertaining free to play FPS game.\n\nPros:\n+Solid weapon variety, yet, almost all weapons are side-grades or specializations, meaning you're not at any disadvantage just because you're using starting gear.\n+Alright faction flavor, unfortunately a bit watered down for reasons I'll get to later.\n+Reasonable weapon customization options, typically allowing you to specialize a weapon towards either hipfiring or aiming down the sights, then with some weapons shifting their damage profile towards close range or long range focus.\n+Very good design on ground vehicles, other than the ATVs that can mount weapons and cloak they all feel rather fun to fight against or alongside, or to drive and gun yourself. They look nice too.\n+The game rewards teamwork strongly and has good mechanics for implementing it, you can even just jump into a random squad by pressing 'insert' at any time if you're playing solo. Solo play is entirely workable in my opinion as well, but requires more map awareness.\n+Massive battles, during busy hours there can be multiple 100v100 fights going on around the very large map.\n\n\nCons:\n-The faction flavor is slightly watered down by the presence of Nanite Systems (adaptation of the abbreviation for "Non Empire Specific or Non Specific" weapons) guns. I would describe these as "Call of Duty guns" to properly capture their role in the game. They're bland, generic, overly easy to use, and sometimes even outright better than their Empire Specific counterparts (mostly unintentionally on the last point). Unfortunately the developers had commissioned the models for these weapons at quite an expense a long time ago, so they're basically stuck implementing and keeping them.\n\n-Reasonably high system requirements. Really this isn't a surprise, this is a wargame with tremendous upper limits of players, vehicles, physically tracked projectiles, and so forth. However, I can run it on mid to high graphics with an i3 processor and a GTX 650 Ti, so it's definitely not "Arbitrarily unoptimized generic FPS game 2015-16"\n\n-The "Air Game"** is entirely isolated and poorly balanced against the rest of the gameplay. Your experience with it if you don't fly yourself will pretty much just be getting insta-gibbed by rocket pods from Empire Specific Fighters when on foot and 1 to 2 shot no matter what vehicle you're in by the Liberator Gunship's Dalton Cannon. the Rocket Pods are an extremely spammable and extremely high capacity explosive weapon with a wide blast radius while the Dalton (main gun) and Tank Buster (nose gun) for the Liberator can kill vehicles before they can even begin to react then the Lib can fly away with impunity. As for your options against air when not in an air vehicle? There's the "Skyguard" for Lightning tanks(which are killed casually by liberators) that can very slowly plink away at an air vehicle's health and maybe kill it if the pilot is asleep and there's two or more Skyguard lightnings around. There's also Bursters for the MAX units, which are armored exoskeletons that cost resources to pull. Same story as the Skyguard. The most effective option is an anti-air rocket launcher for the Heavy Assault, which costs you a fair deal of effectiveness against ground armor in exchange for maybe killing an ESF or Valkyrie(small transports) if there's multiple HA's around or the pilot sits still instead of fleeing, and no chance of killing Liberators or Galaxies(dropships).\n\n**No I don't have any solutions to this, limiting the ammo capacity of certain air vehicle weapons further would probably help, but might be too harsh.\n\n\n\nAdvice to new players:\n1)It's not your gun, it's you. Spending certs(xp) on new guns won't really improve your play early on, as the guns other than the starting ones are often /harder/ to use. Exception: the NC default LMG, the Gauss Saw, is a nightmare for newbies, get the cheap small LMG, it's comparable in DPS and easier to handle.\n2)SPEND CERTS ON CLASS FEATURES AND UTILITY ITEMS. I am dead serious about this, your biggest jump in effectiveness will come from building a class specialized to your playstyle from the available traits, utility items, and so forth.\n3) Find a gun sight from your current faction you like and stick with it. Ironsights are alright but a gunsight that fits your awareness and preferred combat range will definitely improve your staying power. Generally all sights from 1x to 4x are available across most guns (you have to cert it for each gun though, but they're cheap), then there's a separate set of 6x to 12x for some sniper rifles.\n4) Find cover, first, and always. Planetside 2 is a brutally lethal FPS and if you get flanked or caught out while sprinting your odds of survival are very low if you try to stop and fight. Find cover, let your shields recover, and ambush them as they chase you or try to get around the enemy.\n\n\nThe Factions:\nThe New Conglomerate(NC) are miners, laborers, and other "lower class" employees fighting to free Auraxium (the planet of the game's setting) from the Terran Republic, their gear is modeled after repurposed industrial equipment and 'locally' designed and produced firearms. Big emphasis on shotguns. Their Empire Specific vehicles and weapons tend to be bulky, sturdy, and hard-hitting as a rule.\nThe Vanu Sovereignty(VS) are the scientists and engineers, nominally those of the original expeditions to Auraxium and their gear reflects it, focusing on energy weapons and hover technology. They practically worship the alien precursor species referred to as Vanu, who they obviously named themselves after. Their vehicles and weapons tend to focus on mobility, quick reloads, and so forth.\nThe Terran Republic(TR) could be seen as the Big Bad Imperials or the guys just trying to keep everything together, depending on your take on it. They use very classical military doctrine and equipment, their weapons focusing on high fire rate with simple ammunition with an emphasis on miniguns. Their Main Battle Tank has one of the more interesting gimmicks in that it can 'lock down' to increase its fire rate and shell velocity at a cost of mobility.","April 6","true","455.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I've never played or seen anything else that provides an FPS experience with hundreds to thousands of player combatants present. There's no NPCs. Its much more like experiencing a real(ish) war. The massive scale vehicle battles in particular are things you just have to be there for.\n\nThat said, its a cruel game. Time to kill is on average less than a second so its high lethality. You'll die a lot and often in bitter ways. However, the kills you do get are gonna feel awesome.\n\nIts not a newb friendly game and your mad FPS skills won't help ease that much. Pro tip: Get in and use the social tab to join a public platoon. Strength in numbers is vital. Running around with a group of experienced players will definitely get you the best experiences PS2 has to offer. Run around alone and you'll probably just be wasting your time.\n\nPublic platoons are very forgiving and nice. You don't need voip to participate, you can hop in and out as you need and no one will care. Just make sure to stay with the group. No one like a squad-mate who runs off alone all the time.\n\n\n\n","March 2","true","432.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There's guns, there's violence, and finally, there's shenanigans. If you don't know what I mean by that, then you've never found a creative or humiliating way to kill someone in a game (of which Planetside 2 has plenty.) It goes above and beyond by having a balanced class structure, with all six classes having a distinct role in combat. With that said, and the aforementioned insane amount of weapons, attachments, and not to mention cosmetic items, you can play this game pretty much however you want. Want to spear the assault and go in guns blazing? Check. Want to be that sneaky, shady guy in the corner, promoting open-mindedness one bullet at a time? Check. Or maybe you want to be some form of support, either by repairing things or patching up people? Yup, it's got those too. The vehicles are very well implemented, too, allowing you to rule the skies in either fighter aircraft, gunships, or a large troop transporter. Add in tanks, buggies, ATV's, and a combat bus (No, I'm not making that up) and you make for an insanity-fest just waiting to happen. Oh, and the absolutely massive battles don't help this. Sometimes, you're in three man skirmishes, and other times... you just run face-first into an armored column of no less than thirty tanks. It's big, it's scary, and damn if it isn't fun. Even better, it's FREE! (As in, no money, no problems.)","August 3, 2014","true","361.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

To buy a small ship with one seat that goes fast and got gunners its 150 and that is the ship costs the least!\nTo make one thing clear that i did not understand at the moment, the game uses station account. This may sound like something you never ever used, But to make it easyer for you i will say that if you ever got DC universe or the old game star wars the adventure game you can use that account in this game:-) they all use the same account and it is hard to notice.

If you revive or walk all the way back don't kill the person because it'll only make it harder for your team and there is a punishment if you do friendly fire enough times (thank god).

A piece of crap the likes of which no one had seen before! Unfortunately, MOST people who tried this game out had debilitating lag, crippling FPS, and thus a terrible experience.  Since Performance Update 1 (OMFG patch), my FPS with a medium-of-the-line computer are 60+ all of the time, often at 100+.  If you tried it back at launch and couldn't play, I would heartily recommend you fire it up.\n\nAs far as the gameplay, PS2 is insanely fun. The vehicles in this game are fun to drive, the gunplay is very responsive, and overall the progression is very good (You could argue that the game is P2W, but only until you learn how to make certs efficiently).\n\nThe Devs in the game are very responsive on their forums or reddit, and crippling bugs are usually patched next day, with medium ones being patched within the week. This is a huge game, so there are MANY smaller bugs, but they seldom are more than an annoyance.  There are very few hackers in the game, or at least ones that are around for more than a week or so.  Aimbotting used to be very prevalent, but has died down; the only real form of cheating is lag switches now, which are very hard to detect.\n\nProbably the worst part of this game is the balance of both the factions and the weapons.  In essence, one faction (NC) has been at a disadvantage for more than 6 months by almost all statistics, and yet have received very little in the way of major buffs or nerfs. I am not part of this faction, so I'm not just QQ'ing; it's pretty widely known by those who regularly like to peruse stats.\nIn addition, 'cheesy' weapons that allow one to farm certs very quickly are frequently put into the game/made by overbuffing that cause massive unrest in the community (the forums warrior-ism in this game is very strong) leads to a 'flavor of the month', as they are later nerfed. These weapons WILL make you mad, regardless of your rank, but if you stick with it, you can BE that â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥!\n\nIf you can get past your first couple hours, join an outfit, play with your squad, and learn the ropes, you almost certainly will have fun with this game!","November 27, 2013","true","962.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It will blow your ideas of massive scale battles in a video game out of the water, rivalled only by a few select titles. Soon upon entry you will learn that as a singular soldier your affect on the waging war is minuet at best, but your duty as an individual in a faction is as important as the people fighting by your side.\n\nPlanetSide 2 is a game best played when working with others, or simply causing havoc with your friends. There's no feeling that can compare to flying well above the ground in a gunship, firing off rounds from a Dalton - an explosive cannon - upon the unsuspecting targets below. Well co-ordinated attacks see uncountable masses of tanks rolling across the continent, much to the defender's disdain. The sheer scale of PlanetSide is impressive at its worst, spectacular at its best.\n\nBeing a free-to-play MMO, the war never ceases. There is a vast pool of weapons, resources and upgrades at your disposal. Station cash makes for the inevitable real-world currency of an MMO, allowing you to boost your experience or purchase vanity items. Everything else can be bought with Certs, a currency that is earned through play. In the end, the experience you have or wish to have is entirely up to you.","January 22, 2014","true","257.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

For example, you can scale sides of cliffs of infantry while standing on nothing but thin air. But that doesn't bother me at all, because doing that gives me an advantage for good sniping spots.\n\nMoving onto the dynamics... this game is FREE-TO-PLAY! Which is great, having any one of my friends just hop in and play. There are 15$ month memberships and bundles where the per month price decreases the more you subscribe.. And there is also the daybreak cash premium currency, this is mostly useless unless you wish to buy decoratives or armor for your character, and new camos. But everything else that actually affects gameplay can be acquired by Certs (In-game credit points) for every 250 experience you earn.\n\nFor the graphics and optimization of the game... The game itself is poorly optimized but if you do run it at highest settings it does look pretty damn good. On my gtx 460 i ran it at straight up medium settings with about 35 fps, but now with a gtx 970, it is absolutely amazing at max.\n\nNow to summarize this game up, it is a must download and try out for sure.. deff the best MMOFPS i've played, and when it was first released in 2012, i thought it was ahead of it's time, and in some aspects it still is. There may be a feel of repetition and grinding when you're playing by yourself, but once you get a great group of friends going you'll find yourself putting countless hours into the game.","July 12, 2015","true","167.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

This game is many things, but the simplest idea for any new players is the scale. You'll truly feel small when hundreds, I mean HUNDREDS of players fight from futuristic tanks, on jetpacks, heavy bombers, starcraft dropships and from mechanized war suits. In the midst of the chaos, you'll truly feel what a real FPS should feel like, not some tight urban corner fight with assault rifles, but a environmental integration of combined arms combat. Enjoy the thrill of joining into outfits, and join a community of diverse players, from BR 100 elitist players whose KD means more than gold, to the vast ranks of zerg squads to change the tide of the fight through the number of bodies you can throw at the enemy. Enjoy the diversity of the three empires: the Vanu, an unbalanced faction of zero recoil pea shooters and neckbeards so thick you think they are the Canadian Confederacy. The Terran Republic, a militaristic faction of farm flyers and terrifying zerg outfits. The New Conglomerate, whose completely dysfunctional leadership is only countered by their freedom to accuracy ratios on their weapons. Revel in the 4 well designed continents that mostly are never used because only Indar has enough fights. Engage in a highly integral multiplayer experience, from drunk squads lead by sloshed leaders and their even more wasted compatriots, to elite platoon whose only difference from the military is physical activity. In this crazy universe of perpetual war, load your gun, strap on your max suits, grab those frags, and prepare to drop into the most unique FPS of all time.","January 4, 2015","true","438.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CoSM3/recommended/218230/","CoSM3","CS","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CoSM3/","64 products in account","Rewriting because I guess I didn't give enough justice, huh.\n\nPlanetside 2 is a massive game unlike anything you've ever played. If you ever think you've played something like it then no, you haven't. If you think you wil be automatically good when you play it, you won't. The learning curve is incredibly steep, and the fact is that skills you learn in Planetside will not transfer over to other games, simply because the game is unlike anything else.\n\nSOE at times seems like a mindless company. Their executive decisions are questionable to say the least, but they're managed to maintain Planetside as an enjoyable experience. Its uniiqueness is what brings it most of its flavour. That's really what killed it. Your experience playing Planetside 2 will be unlike anything you've seen. Planetside 2 is like the little girl you knew growing up. She was proper and loved by everyone in Elementary and Middle School, and especially by you, but when you got to High School she all of a sudden turned into a crackâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. Playing Planetside is similar in that you become so attached to the game (If you don't quit immediately after getting dominated constantly and refusing to learn the game) and cry when you see the incompetence of the executive team and theoretically watching your true love get â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ by a gorilla in front of you.\n\nThe FPS mechanics in this game are among the highest tier of modern FPS games. The gunplay is smooth and feels right. There are times where you'll be fun policed by zergs, vehicles, liberators, but overall infantry fights, if you ever manage to find any, are very good, And "If you ever manage to find any" brings us to our next paragraph.\n\nPopulations are... fluctuated. I'm lucky because Connery is the biggest server in the game and that's the server I play on. You can find a fight for the most part at any time of the day. This is different from what I've read up on other servers, and from what I've experience playing on other servers. Servers such as Matherson and Waterson (East Coast) Suffer from horrible population imbalances and there's large scales of players quitting due to the lack of fights. SOE's involvement in managing population balance is... Not really there at all.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this game, it is a very good game at its core, regardless of the pessimistic comments you hear from hierarchial players including myself. The main problem of the game is the poor executive decisions made on it. If you can get around that then you will have an amazing experience playing the game. It's truly unique and I can guarantee you will at least have 100 hours of fun playing it if you can get around the initial curve. If you can go hardcore and get 1000 hours in, congratulations, you're a masochist.","January 1, 2014","true","977.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Stop and consider those stars. Each one is a ball of superheated gas, floating out there in space with its own history. It's a staggering realisation.\n\nStop for a second in PlanetSide 2 and you'll see a similar thing, except instead of stars, you're seeing people. Real people, just as out of reach in their homes to you as those stars. Stand and stare up at the sky and you might see a Belgian kid hurtle overhead, chased by a Spanish man in a fighter jet. As the Spanish man's rockets connect with his fuselage, the Belgian kid will wink out of existence like a star going out.\n\nEvery light in the sky, every light on the ground, is another person. PlanetSide 2 is a massively multiplayer first-person shooter, and although it's identical in concept to the original PlanetSide: three factions wage eternal war on the ground and in the air over a handful of continents, it feels like the future of games. PlanetSide was crippled by 2003's technology; PlanetSide 2 has the benefit of nine years of human advancement.\n\nHundreds of players fight across three continents. Indar is red and dusty, Mars with a few scrubby trees. Amerish is green, verdant, and liberally coated in dense jungle. Esamir is icy and beautiful, lit by northern lights at night and reflected sun glare during the day. Each continent is studded with bases of varying size that one of three sides - the militaristic Terran Republic, the self-righteous New Conglomerate and the alien-humping Vanu Sovereignty - can capture. Capturing bases bestows resource bonuses that pay out every few minutes. Those resources can then be used to buy vehicles and infantry supplies from designated terminals found around the huge map, all facilitating PlanetSide 2âs central tenet: a vast, unfurling war between hundreds of players at once, the largest scale of battle yet seen in games outside of EVE Onlineâs wild space.\n\nI never thought it'd work. PlanetSide 2 is an MMO, it has hundreds of players living on a small amount of global servers â but it also has twitchy combat, bullets based on real physics, and the kind of vehicle fights that demand split second reactions. Few games have combined the two concepts well. The original game used behind-the-scenes number-magic that left weapons feeling toothless and combat floaty.\n\nPlanetSide 2's weapons feel neither toothless nor floaty. They feel like weapons, guns that fire projectiles where you aim them. As a heavy assault class soldier, your bullets will slice through the shield and skin of an enemy at close range. As a sniper toting a powerful enough rifle, a bullet aimed slightly above the head of a long-range target will arc down into their visor to score you a one shot kill.\n\nPlanetSide 2 has five classes, including the snipey Infiltrator, the chunky Heavy Assault, with Light Assault, Medic, and Engineer rounding out the group. Spawn as one of these and head to a re-arm station and youâll be able to play in the clothes of the sixth class: the MAX suit. These lumbering beauties pack a heavy weapon glued to each arm, and act like walking tanks - softer targets than their angry house friends, but able to dish out exponentially more punishment than regular armour-clad types.\n\nInfantry combat isn't perfect. Some intangible element â either developer SOE's inexperience with modern shooters or the sheer size of the game â means that PlanetSide 2's guns lack the raw punch of a smaller scale FPS. Call of Duty has this down to an exact science. There, I can almost feel the bullets piercing the organs of my enemies. Here, it's closer to Battlefield 3, and not quite as powerful in sensation.\n\nAlso like Battlefield 3, death is accompanied by pre-canned animation. Snuff it and your avatar flops to the floor, arm out like a bad movie death. Somehow, it makes you feel powerless and frustrated, your own star winking out of existence.\n\nBut these are tradeoffs I'll happily make for the game's scale. I've fought shotgun duels in four-foot wide corridors, but I've also lanced someone in the head from five hundred metres away, ending the digital life of a far off francophone. Infantry combat is wild and crazy and freeform in an intoxicating way, taking place at all distances and in all settings.\n\n","June 28, 2014","true","810.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thecrownhasstolen/recommended/218230/","thecrownhasstolen","KrowH","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thecrownhasstolen/","212 products in account","When it's dark â properly dark â you can look up at the night sky and see a multitude of stars. Stop and consider those stars. Each one is a ball of superheated gas, floating out there in space with its own history. It's a staggering realisation.\n\nStop for a second in PlanetSide 2 and you'll see a similar thing, except instead of stars, you're seeing people. Real people, just as out of reach in their homes to you as those stars. Stand and stare up at the sky and you might see a Belgian kid hurtle overhead, chased by a Spanish man in a fighter jet. As the Spanish man's rockets connect with his fuselage, the Belgian kid will wink out of existence like a star going out.\n\nEvery light in the sky, every light on the ground, is another person. PlanetSide 2 is a massively multiplayer first-person shooter, and although it's identical in concept to the original PlanetSide: three factions wage eternal war on the ground and in the air over a handful of continents, it feels like the future of games. PlanetSide was crippled by 2003's technology; PlanetSide 2 has the benefit of nine years of human advancement.\n\nHundreds of players fight across three continents. Indar is red and dusty, Mars with a few scrubby trees. Amerish is green, verdant, and liberally coated in dense jungle. Esamir is icy and beautiful, lit by northern lights at night and reflected sun glare during the day. Each continent is studded with bases of varying size that one of three sides - the militaristic Terran Republic, the self-righteous New Conglomerate and the alien-humping Vanu Sovereignty - can capture. Capturing bases bestows resource bonuses that pay out every few minutes. Those resources can then be used to buy vehicles and infantry supplies from designated terminals found around the huge map, all facilitating PlanetSide 2âs central tenet: a vast, unfurling war between hundreds of players at once, the largest scale of battle yet seen in games outside of EVE Onlineâs wild space.\n\nI never thought it'd work. PlanetSide 2 is an MMO, it has hundreds of players living on a small amount of global servers â but it also has twitchy combat, bullets based on real physics, and the kind of vehicle fights that demand split second reactions. Few games have combined the two concepts well. The original game used behind-the-scenes number-magic that left weapons feeling toothless and combat floaty.\n\nPlanetSide 2's weapons feel neither toothless nor floaty. They feel like weapons, guns that fire projectiles where you aim them. As a heavy assault class soldier, your bullets will slice through the shield and skin of an enemy at close range. As a sniper toting a powerful enough rifle, a bullet aimed slightly above the head of a long-range target will arc down into their visor to score you a one shot kill.\n\nPlanetSide 2 has five classes, including the snipey Infiltrator, the chunky Heavy Assault, with Light Assault, Medic, and Engineer rounding out the group. Spawn as one of these and head to a re-arm station and youâll be able to play in the clothes of the sixth class: the MAX suit. These lumbering beauties pack a heavy weapon glued to each arm, and act like walking tanks - softer targets than their angry house friends, but able to dish out exponentially more punishment than regular armour-clad types.\n\nInfantry combat isn't perfect. Some intangible element â either developer SOE's inexperience with modern shooters or the sheer size of the game â means that PlanetSide 2's guns lack the raw punch of a smaller scale FPS. Call of Duty has this down to an exact science. There, I can almost feel the bullets piercing the organs of my enemies. Here, it's closer to Battlefield 3, and not quite as powerful in sensation.\n\nAlso like Battlefield 3, death is accompanied by pre-canned animation. Snuff it and your avatar flops to the floor, arm out like a bad movie death. Somehow, it makes you feel powerless and frustrated, your own star winking out of existence.\n\nBut these are tradeoffs I'll happily make for the game's scale. I've fought shotgun duels in four-foot wide corridors, but I've also lanced someone in the head from five hundred metres away, ending the digital life of a far off francophone. Infantry combat is wild and crazy and freeform in an intoxicating way, taking place at all distances and in all settings.\n\n","June 28, 2014","true","810.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The description stating "revolutionary" is precisely what it is; no other FPS can even come close to this and really tosses them out of any competition. Massive scale battles, plenty of different vehicles to choose from, countless hours of gameplay, and a superb class customization and squad system. If you choose to pay to play, that's fine, but it's really all just cosmetics, which really makes this game up to who's skilled and, well, who's not.\n\nThe only thing I would really say that can be seen as a negative point is the in-game currency takes quite a while to accrue, which means you'll be spending a lot of time saving for a single gun, for a single class, for a single character. The game has its shares of strange kinks, but that's honestly to be expected with a game on a scale this big.\n\nVerdict? 10/10","August 21, 2014","true","768.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

The goal: capture more territory for your faction, which is one of three themed teams. Territories are captured by captureing points points in a king of the hill and CTF kind of way. Each territory has between 1 and 3 points that are captured by being withing a ccertain distance of a point. After that, it can take up to 5 minutes for the territory to be completely captured. The only hard part is how you achive this goal and fend off players who are constantly running back from their spawn room or Sunderrer (a truck) Mobile Spawnpoint. This is the hard part about this is the route that you take to do this.\n\n\nFirst off, there are 3 factions who each have their own benefits, art style, and specalizations.\n\nThe Vanu Sovreignty (VS) are a spandex peoples who believe that technology is the most important thing when it concerns the evolution of society. Their weapons boast little bullet drop, and quick reload speeds. They also have some AOE guns (exploding plasma shots).\n\nThe New Conglomerate (NC) are the liberators, fighting for freedom. They have low fire rates with hard hitting weapons combined with huge magazines. Just be prepared for the rediculous reload times. Also the NC are VERY fond of shotguns.\n\nThe Terran Republic (TR) are fighting for something (justice I think???). They have high fire rates and are very fond of chainguns.\n\nPersonally I specialize in being a close range infiltrator (they have lower health but have sheilds). SMGs while expensive, are excellent killing machines. The other classes are the light and heavy infantry, engineer, medic, and MAX. Each class has it's specific guns, abilities, and uses.\n\nThe difficult thing about Planetside 2 is that positioning is vitally important. After about 250 hours I started getting the flow of the game. By 400 hours I was finally starting to mantain a KD above 1. This game has a steep learning curve and will take a lot of getting used to. However, I see the 500+ hours completely worth it and can't wait till summer so I can play this a lot more.","December 7, 2015","true","713.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rottmer/recommended/218230/","rottmer","Rottmer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rottmer/","197 products in account","In terms of gameplay style, this is very much like Battlefield. Several classes, all with unique perks (medkits, ammo resupply, turrets, anti-vehicle weapons, cloaking, jetpacks, and more), as well as ground vehicles and air vehicles made for either transportion and combat, and one of them even acts like a tanky spawn point for spawing in for battles so you don't have to walk all over or drive to where the fighting is.\n\nThe unique aspects of Planetside 2 come from the faction system and the continents present in the game. Every faction is unique in just about every aspect, from voices available, to armor, weapons and weapon functions, and even the sound they make when you coak as an infiltrator. Each faction fights for control of the continents on the planet, and after any faction reaches 15 VP (Victory Points)  on one continent, that continent is locked down and they gain a passive buff, such as health regeneration or reduced cost for air/ground vehicles. Only two continents can get locked down at a time, and they eventually unlock to be fought over once more. Battles in this game are huge, and can get VERY hectic, so expect your FPS to drop pretty fast once the fighting starts getting bigger and bigger (the game is pretty optimized though!)\n\nBeing a F2P shooter, one might expect that its pay to win but thankfully its far from it. The progression in this game doesn't change whether you pay or don't, it only becomes faster. All weapons in this game are considered side-grades, that are only bought to complement a specific playstyle rather than be a straight buff to damage or handling. While you can buy weapons with cash rather than certs, all of it is easily obtainble by just playing. You can get by in this game with just the default weapons with a few attachments of your choosing and do just fine. You buy weapons and attachments with certs, which are also used to upgrade a class of your choosing. The upgrades can be passive, like resistance to infantry arms to reduce damage, increased ammo storage, or quicker shield regen. Active upgrades, such as the jump jets for the Light Assault, allow the class to manuever in air with less downtime at higher ranks and quicker regeneration; or the Heavy Assault to get an extras shield ability that allows them to mitigate more damage.\n\nThe game lacks a proper tutorial, however, which is sort of the downfall of it. Even the Koltyr planet, meant for newbies, doesn't seem to do much as they encourage you to simply hop into battle. Still, the game is basic enough and there are plenty of guides out there to help familarize yourself with classes, their abilities, and much more. This review only glosses over some of the things in this game, there is still quite a bit of things here like base building/construction, vehicle progression (they also take certs and can be specialized!), customization, etc.\n\nLive free in the NC!","May 11","true","43.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

Can be kind of grindy at times\n2. Zergs of enemies can be anoying and frustrating. (feel as it has gotten better since more people are playing the game; thus balancing out the pop of bases\n3. Tank Mines ... Jk :0\n\nOverall i would definitely recommend this game. if you do try it, try to join a squad its loads of fun. And by the way all of the negative reviews are outdated including the ones about hacking. (I have yet to find a hacker in game and ive played the game for a 1 and 1/2 years. the game has changed alot and is being worked on consitiently by daybreak games devs.","May 11","true","295.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

Not kidding. But here is my review for this wonderful game.\n\nI MIGHT UPDATE THIS THE MORE I PLAY PLANETSIDE 2.\n\nPROS:\n1000s of players at once\nFREE TO PLAY\nGood enough graphics for me\nGood gameplay\nNEW CONSTRUCTION SYSTEM\nFun with friends\n\nCONS:\nBad optimization (TRICK: Right click Planetside 2's process, click Set Affinity then uncheck the first core or "CPU 0")\nSome weapons/vehicles are OP or UP.\nSome P2W stuff (What can you expect? It's F2P.\nRequires real good PC (You can't handle 1000s of players on that old PC man.)\n\nGAMEPLAY\nIt's 3 factions fighting it out on a bunch of continents seeking to conquer it all. It plays like a futuristic version of Heroes and Generals. It's weapons are good but some are underpowered or overpowered. If you have some friends who have this game, you could ask them to play with you and all of you can have fun stuff to do as a squad.\n\nGRAPHICS\nIt's pretty cool. It's pretty much from my experience your usual 2012 game graphics.\n\nFACTIONS\nThe New Conglomerate is you can imagine as your typical balanced empire.\nThe Vanu Sovereignty is the tech-savvy guy. Imagine it as that guy who sits on the PC all day and making Harry Potter stuff.\nThe Terran Republic basically is the Soviet Union + Futuristic tech. That double-barrelled tank tho.\n\nCLASSES\nLight Assault is the guy who goes around the frontlines flanking enemies. I picture him as my run and gun guy.\nEngineer is that guy who can build you almost anything. Combine the future with him and you got PS2's engineer.\nMedic is self-explanatory. Run around shooting enemies while healing your mates.\nInfiltrator is that creepy guy who follows you around wanting to know your secrets. In PS2 his job is slightly different.\nHeavy Assault is the light assault big brother. He's more better off in a head-on attack rather than flanking.\nMax I do not know yet. Never played him yet but due to his name I picture him as a juggernaut.\n\nSo I say this game is: (DRUM ROLL)\n9/10: Worth trying.\n\nNOTE! I HAVEN'T PLAYED THIS GAME THAT MUCH YET SO I HAVE TO PLAY MORE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE GAME. LOOK AT MY TOTAL HOURS! 18 HOURS!\nMeh. That's as much as I can think of. As more as I play this game, I might update my review.","May 13","true","18.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","3","4","2","0"

Is it really gonna take that long to download? It's probably gonna suck for a free game...right? Well the truth is no matter how many reviews you see on this game you're never going to be able to clearly depict what you feel about it until you play it. Honestly I thought this was just another fail of a free game. Then I played it...not realizing i was already 12 hours in. This game will completely put you in awe of what it's capabilities truly are. Just when you think you understand everthing and you've "been here", or "done that" you will be surprised by another completely new experience. EVERY.....SINGLE....TIME....never once have I played this game and had the same experience. One time I'm just a lone wolf out in the middle of enemy territory gathering intel for a platoon so I could help thier efforts, while another time I'm in the middle of a 3 WAY WAR BETWEEN ALL FACTIONS. However, the last time I went on I took control of an entire platoon. Nothing really does prepare you for the action packed strategic role of a Platoon Commaner. The bottom line is, this game will blow you away with it's...well...awesomeness. I've never played a game in history like this. There's honestly not even any games I can compare this to. Actually maybe it's like battlefield......on crack. Anyways play this game if you truly want to see something special.

The Vanu Faction is easily more powerful than the other two factions while the Terran Republic is the weakest faction based on stats alone. The prices are too high and every update/hotfix tends to break more things than they fix.

It's the ultimate FPS that throws you into adrenaline fueled battles on an epic scale. Forget Call of Duty or Battlefield, in Planetside 2 you can drop anywhere you want across 4 different continents where there are litterally thousands of players desperately fighting over control with intense infrantry, tank and air battles dotting the beautifully crafted landscape.\n\nAlso unlike other FPS, Planetside 2's starting weapons are actually good, this is no 'Pay-2-Win' game. There are no better or worse weapons, just different unlocks to suit different needs & playstyle. These weapons are free to unlock using cert points gained from fighting. This can be slow for the first week until you get used to the game then they start to flow in very quickly as you find the class or vehicle that suits you best.\n\nThis game heavily relies on teamwork and communication. While you don't need a microphone, it is important that you use the in-game chat system to coordinate with your team and to find a good outfit to work with. There are plenty of outfits out there that take on new players and will even teach them a few things in-game.\n\nBut the best thing about Planetside 2, it's 100% completely free.\n\nIf you interested in trying the game and my review has helped in any way, feel free to message me via steam and I'll pass on a recruitment link to create your account which gives you a free in-game bonus starter gear pack for some free unlocks including 3 extra weapons and an experience booster to get you started.\n\nServer: Cobalt (EU)\nIn-game Name: Gwennec\nFaction: Terran Republic\nOutfit: [K29C] Knights of the 29th Century\nClass: Combat Medic","September 24, 2014","true","739.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

It is special and that makes for interesting content. But it has some very serious and hurting game foundation problems. Firstly, don't expect to play this game on a laptop nor low budget gaming pc. This by far the most heavy resource hogg game i have ever exposed my computer to. It is such a cpu heavy game, and high frames are hard to achieve, even on minimum settings. Besides that, the developers of this do not profit much from the game, due to it's free to play mechanic. Therefor, the penalty for that falls on the progression of the game. There are numerous annoying bugs that have been around since the start of game, and not yet been fixed. The game is amazing when it comes down to it, with alot of variety in game play, all the way from different styles of playing as infantry, or with different vehicles.\nIf you have a clan or play with friends, there is room for alot of strategic game play, or just goof around.\nDo i recommend this game? Yes i do. If you look passed it's problems, the game has way too many possibilites.\nIf you have the specs for it, give it a go!

This game requires communication, cooperation, and teamwork (also a good computer that can run the game) to start doing some real damage to the warring factions. The three main factions are, Vanu Sovereignty, Terran Republic, and New Conglomerate. Each of these factions have personalized weapons, vehicles, and clothing to suit that you are different from them. The Vanu Sovereighnty are the most hi-tech faction from all of them, they have hover tanks, plasma weapons, and scythes which are the most OP air vehicle known to Planetside 2. Terran Republic is a strong faction that wants to reunite all to one flag, they have awesome weaponry (like the burst fire pistol), good mechs, and good tanks. Finally, the New Conglomerate is almost exactly like Terran Republic, but they are rebelling against them calling them tyrants, they do have the same Things as the Terran Republic, but AWESOME THEME MUSIC, that music could switch a battle (it's that good lol).\n\nOnce you pick a faction you will be set off in the world of in 4 continents (don't worry they are adding more), these feel almost like planets because they are so different and are so huge. The first continent is Indar which is a mix of deserts and canyons. The 2nd continent is Esamir, which is just a barren frozen wastland. The 3rd continent is Amerish just imagine this continent as Earth a very green place indeed. The last continent is Hossin which is newly added, and is a riddled with MASSIVE trees and swampy lands.\n\nFinally, you will just be battling in one of four continents claiming all the land against the other opponent factions. Most of the time you will be fighting in large numbers (even ranging from 200 player battles). That's a lot, but the most trickest thing about this game is the weapon unlocking system. If you get enough certification points you can unlock/upgrade pretty much anything that kills anyone or makes it harder for enemies to kill you. It's just that you don't get enough to even get a game, it would probably take 2 weeks to get a gun on this game if you were playing everyday for +5 hours. They really need to fix that too, you can of course buy the weapons with station cash, but that is overpriced as well because a gun may cost $10, just for a gun... So beware of that. Other than that everything is perfect and rememberable.\n\nNOW GO SOLDIER FIGHT AND LIVE ON!","September 28, 2014","true","67.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

This game requires communication, cooperation, and teamwork (also a good computer that can run the game) to start doing some real damage to the warring factions. The three main factions are, Vanu Sovereignty, Terran Republic, and New Conglomerate. Each of these factions have personalized weapons, vehicles, and clothing to suit that you are different from them. The Vanu Sovereighnty are the most hi-tech faction from all of them, they have hover tanks, plasma weapons, and scythes which are the most OP air vehicle known to Planetside 2. Terran Republic is a strong faction that wants to reunite all to one flag, they have awesome weaponry (like the burst fire pistol), good mechs, and good tanks. Finally, the New Conglomerate is almost exactly like Terran Republic, but they are rebelling against them calling them tyrants, they do have the same Things as the Terran Republic, but AWESOME THEME MUSIC, that music could switch a battle (it's that good lol).\n\nOnce you pick a faction you will be set off in the world of in 4 continents (don't worry they are adding more), these feel almost like planets because they are so different and are so huge. The first continent is Indar which is a mix of deserts and canyons. The 2nd continent is Esamir, which is just a barren frozen wastland. The 3rd continent is Amerish just imagine this continent as Earth a very green place indeed. The last continent is Hossin which is newly added, and is a riddled with MASSIVE trees and swampy lands.\n\nFinally, you will just be battling in one of four continents claiming all the land against the other opponent factions. Most of the time you will be fighting in large numbers (even ranging from 200 player battles). That's a lot, but the most trickest thing about this game is the weapon unlocking system. If you get enough certification points you can unlock/upgrade pretty much anything that kills anyone or makes it harder for enemies to kill you. It's just that you don't get enough to even get a game, it would probably take 2 weeks to get a gun on this game if you were playing everyday for +5 hours. They really need to fix that too, you can of course buy the weapons with station cash, but that is overpriced as well because a gun may cost $10, just for a gun... So beware of that. Other than that everything is perfect and rememberable.\n\nNOW GO SOLDIER FIGHT AND LIVE ON!","September 28, 2014","true","67.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

It is special and that makes for interesting content. But it has some very serious and hurting game foundation problems. Firstly, don't expect to play this game on a laptop nor low budget gaming pc. This by far the most heavy resource hogg game i have ever exposed my computer to. It is such a cpu heavy game, and high frames are hard to achieve, even on minimum settings. Besides that, the developers of this do not profit much from the game, due to it's free to play mechanic. Therefor, the penalty for that falls on the progression of the game. There are numerous annoying bugs that have been around since the start of game, and not yet been fixed. The game is amazing when it comes down to it, with alot of variety in game play, all the way from different styles of playing as infantry, or with different vehicles.\nIf you have a clan or play with friends, there is room for alot of strategic game play, or just goof around.\nDo i recommend this game? Yes i do. If you look passed it's problems, the game has way too many possibilites.\nIf you have the specs for it, give it a go!

I have found out, that when I just started, I was simply very very unlucky, with bad player, low pop and some issues. Then I had a whole new experience. It seems I started playing in the middle of some patching and maintenance.\n\nI joined the server. There was a full scale battle with all three factions fighting. I joined a squad, which I didnt even need to, due to the massive action, but I did it, to feel as part of something. Very cool experience. There was teamwork to some degree, and our medic was very awake and useful, even though he was very low level like me (by this I mean, I think he hadn't played for long). There were ally squads everywhere, and it reminded me about the long intro in Saving Private Ryan. The enemy attacked with tanks in the distance, while infantry units tried to move in on us. Apparently, and to my favor, it was us defending a huge base. Seemed like a key point to control. I don't know.\n\nI started out by Infiltrator. What fun gameplay I had. I died a lot, yes, but I am aware this is a game pretty close to the real thing. I was suprised over how well I did. I managed to find very good sniper-spots, and remember this is in the middle of a full scale battle, and i man FULL SCALE battle. Bombs, explosions, bullets and flying light infantry everywhere. I think I was lucky, and the enemy was focused elsewhere, but I managed to use the surroundings, instead of my cloak. I got a lot of kill there. 13 or or, which is pretty much for me. I then went into our base, and found what previously looked, and seemed, like poor building design, suddenly showed huge sniping potential, and great structual design, with a lot of planning behind it. I felt like a coward, just sitting in here, in safety. I shifted to infrantry. Oh boy do they have it hard.\n\nIt is very hard being infrantry, and being so new that you do not know the surroundings that well yet. Yet I stuck to my group, got split up, united again and fought our way over a bridge. I died a lot, but a well praised medic, kept us alive. This was war. This was awesome. The Light Infrantry clearly is better, the more you know how to control the class, and know the enviroment. It is hard, and unforgiving at first, but you then get to know how to utilize the jetpack, and mobility to evade death. You/I most absolutely have to train a bit, but then you should be fine. I got some kills, around 5. Notice that I almost never kill an enemy alone. It is all about teamwork. This can be frustating, but if you like teamwork, it is no problem. Yet I was lucky to be the one dealing the final bullet a lot.\n\nI felt the other Light Infrantry in our squad did a much better job than I. Both at killing and surviving. This might be due to them being higher lvl. This has nothing to do with the lvl, just that they have played longer and knows the game better than me, therefore I felt I didn't do much. So I changed class to be of better use. I mean we already had well trained light infrantry. I chosed medic. Our medic had dissappeared, so why not.\n\nIt is few games where support roles are fun, and even tactical to play, but damn medic in this game is cool as hell. You don't just throw health-packs and sit back in safety. NO you have to go with them straight into battle and grow some soldier balls. We ended up on a stone kind of pillar. We had a bit of shielding from ground infrantry. Yet snipers, and units had a good shot, if we did not crouch. We also took some bad aimed tank shots. I was glued to the ground, crouching and dodging to stay alive. My squad was shooting Rambo-style and doing one hell of a job, also when close-encounter ambushed jump down onto our stone-pillar. Everytime they died, and they died a lot, I would revive them, and try to keep them constantly healed. It worked and I am pretty sure that we were able to hold that piece of the base secure, for at least a little while :) It felt as we did something for the Colony, even though we payed with our lives.\n\nI noticed that high ranking players takes no â¥â¥â¥â¥ at all. I was, in panic, shooting unscoped at a infiltrator trying to melee an ally high rank. I managed to kill the INF, but was executed by my ally high rank, as I had also hit him. I would personally not act like this. It is a bit Eric Cartman-style. Other than that 1 incident, I actually didn't get teamkilled at all. This is wierd since it was all out total chaos. I want to thanks the players online for that. Good Game.\n\nI did not play the other classes, as I still think I need to get to know the game more. Therefore I will focus on 2 classes, maybe 3 with the medic.\n\nI had a very fun time, and will join the game again later. I just kept thinking about, with this little urge to just give it one more try. It worked, and I am beginning to like this game a lot. It really gives some unique and incredible huge battles, that you can safely call wars. You really feel like a little â¥â¥â¥â¥ amongst the total amount â¥â¥â¥â¥ in the world. You are nothing, but as soon as you team up, you are able to at least do a difference. It will never be your name on the front pages, but it could be your faction's name.\n\nThe game can surely throw some players off at first. It is rude and harsh. You have to first get to know the game, enviroment and to control correctly before you are even ready to kill effectively. This can scare off a lot of people. I am still not totally fine the movement in the game. I feel a bit slow, cuffed.. I don't know, it just feels a bit wierd. It is something I have to learn, but it does not annoy me anymore.\n\nYou can be unlucky and join at a bad time, THIS IS IF YOU PLAY ON EU, where there are not that many online. This seems to cause a bit of bad behavior, and team killing seems more likely here. You will have trouble finding action, and what you find might be unbalanced as hell. I don't know how often this happens, but it does not seem to happen that much. I don't feel like weapons are unbalanced. They are more there for a prefered playstyle. An example would be that a sniper can have a high dmg weapon, but very slow firerate/reload. The other sniper has a quick shooting, but low damage sniper rifle. It forces two very different playstyles. So it is clearly not pay2win. I never even accused it of that, but I saw someone complaining about it. It is not.\n\nI am not a fan of the classes easily outmatching other classes, but then I remembered this is not the purpose. You are never ment to go into a base as Light Infrantry and be the hero. This is teamwork. You have to be unfair, and burst in with more men, and smack the ones already laying down. That is just war.\n\nMy biggest issue now is the movement, which is something I just have to learn. Like everything in the world, when you first learned it, it becomes an easy task. I believe that good players have the movement under control a lot, which helps a lot to survive.\n\nI had to change my opinion, this game is really good. If you have friends, and are able to teampeak, then this game would be amazing.\n\n\nPros:\nIntense Action\nNice Loadout system/Class System\nTeamwork is rewarding\nUnique and Enormous battles\nTactical Warfare\nA lot of different Vehicles\nMore Extreme Action\nYou can have air vehicles :O\nGraphics are pretty neat\n\nCons:\nCan at times be low population <- Yet if it is not, I don't really see any cons.\nThe world can feel a bit empty. There are zero flora or wildlife. <- I don't know how much you would pay attention, during a battle anyways, but it is always nice.\nXP is a little slow, which often discourage unskilled players. <- It gives the feeling of no progress.\nIt is very hard to communicate and make plans for the fight.","September 26, 2015","true","16.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","4","6","2","2"

The time has arrived and I wanted a better experience, better graphics so I built a desktop just for the game, the graphics were amazing!!!(everything max.) and I played a bunch of time.\n\nLearning how this game works is important, I mean you can play it but your inical K/D is going to be extremelly negative. (IÂ´m not going to describe every single piece of the game because (1)IÂ´m lazy (1/2)It would take a lot of time).\n\nThe worst thing about this game is the aiming system, not because its bad but because its really hard to control, even with 450 hours i was still an average player, actually when i started playing CS:GO (after playing PlanetSide 2) this game was super easy(CS:GO). If you have played other FPS games this one isnt as easy as it may look, bullet physics and huge maps make it almost imposible for new players.\n\nTo sum up i think this game is a master piece (for a free game), the best game i played so far and its not a P2W GAME!!!

Those of you who played the original may fondly remember getting ground to meat paste in the cavernous hallways of Tech plants, suppressing multiple entries with alien technology and driving around semi desolate continents with a rag tag gang of roughnecks in your back seat will be revitalised and disappointed by this next evolution of the series.\n\nPlanetside 2 does a lot right as far as a first person shooter is concerned. The gunplay is downright meaty and satisfying with plenty of metrics to feed back data on your performance in terms of accuracy, how many people you're killing and how often. While the game has its issues, such as patches occasionally introducing instability which is usually patched out quite quickly, it is overall an incredibly intense and wonderful experience to charge accross a battlefield towards a fortified enemy base with missiles, tank shells and dogfighting aircraft flying over your head.\n\nThe game offers a lot in terms of its gameplay, catering to the gung-ho get me to battle asap style where you quickly respawn and get into the fight blasting enemies away with your triple barrelled shotgun or your 200 bullet magazine miniature chaingun while also catering to a more squad and platoon oriented tactical style where rapid response forces to enemy attacks dropping 40+ players onto a base in unison to storm the control points like some elite special forces.\n\nEach Empire in Planetside 2 share their similarities but also have massive contrasts in their theme, style and gameplay. There is a large pool of equipment available to all factions which are generally balanced and well rounded to the point where you could play without empire specific equipment on any of the factions and still have a large impact on the battle. The empire specific equipment reinforces the strong themes of each Faction, The Terran Republic are well rounded and sleek, favouring oppressive fire with rapid firing weaponry capable of suppressing an entire room with the Miniature chaingun. The New Conglomerate are bulky and favour raw power, their Jackhammer shotgun is capable of bursting someone down instantly provided you land all three shots in it's burst fire mode and beleive me thats no mean feat especially when there is an invisible bugger looking to make mincemeat of your kidneys from behind. The Vanu Sovereignty favour versatility and advanced technology with their Lasher assault rifle, a weapon capable of killing just as efficiently as any other with direct fire but also posessing the unique ability of being able to suppress doorways and enemy positions with its indirect fire splash damage. These weapons are just some examples of the awesome firepower that will be at your fingertips every time you log in. And thats just infantry play!\n\nEach Faction also has thei own specific vehicles with their own strengths and weaknesses, such as the Prowler a terran tank with decidedly low armour but packing two main tank barrels and a high tuned engine makes it a capable fast attacking flank tank or utilizing its deploy seige mode a long range suppression platform capable of laying down massive firepower at the expense of mobility. The Vanguard, a Conglomerate tank is the frontline brawler, it comes equipped with a massive main cannon and a shield capable of blocking an absurd amount of damage for a few seconds which will get it through even the most hairy of engagements. The Magrider, a nimble hovertank that can't rotate it's main gun, but more than makes up for it by being able to strafe in and out of cover aswell as climb all but the most sheer of rockfaces allowing it to get into position to lay down some serious firepower on unsuspecting or unaware foes.\n\nHonestly, theres way too much content to talk about efficiently in terms of the gameplay options available to players in Planetside 2, the best thing to do is try it out - its free, its fun, and it offers a different kind of gameplay for everyone. Whether you're a dedicated boots on the ground infantryman with your trusty anti tank rocket launcher or you have dreams of being an Ace in the sky with one of the empire dogfighting aircraft or even if you just want to play the support role, healing, repairing and ferrying allies from fight to fight. Planetside 2 has a lot to offer, give it a try! You might find yourself hooked!\n\nThe developers are also extremely active and work with the community often, by no means do I want to paint a perfect picture of this game - it is after all a massively multiplay online game, and as such things come with that territory such as occasional game, server and balance instability.","September 27, 2014","true","385.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mizaralcor/recommended/218230/","mizaralcor","Renegade Garou","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mizaralcor/","451 products in account","Still my favorite competitive shooter ever. This is all out war, seriously. The openess of the maps and the base setups create situations you will never experience in single map deathmatch games no matter how many people you pack in them. Lines of troops, tanks, airships punching through an enemy line and rushing the next base in a huge wave of chaos is something like I have never experienced before in a game. It really feels like sometimes I am on a Total War battlefield with how the action takes place on this grander scale. You can feel it when you and your friends are making a difference busting that choke point, and suddenly the tide turns and theres that rush of BOOM, MOVE OUT SOLDIERS!\n\nAs you get to know the maps and how the bases are tied together, you will understand this more. There is a particular area of a map where two bases can see each other with a vast stretch of open land between them. I have been part of tides trying to wave across this field to the next base with utter chaos all over, with gunfire flying from each base and tanks in there positions on either side, hundreds of troops battling out in between hiding behind rocks holding the line. AMAZING. In another area though you may have to fight your way up a hill, creating new situations and different strategies. The maps are varied and the areas have many ways to approach and take on a situation. You can go from these extremes down to going after that base thats available for the taking, but people are not looking at much, creating a smaller deathmatch like situation that can suddenly grow as people see the opening and push it.\n\nThis is truly a massive scale game when it comes to these crazy moments, but there is alot of depth to the classes and vehicles as well. Many upgrades and weapons to get, and alot can be done earning the in game certificates, the free to play model is done very well. Much like a good free to play, you will want to spend the money at some point, but you have plenty to do before, and do not feel forced into it. This game can be harsh, because due to its very chaotic and open nature, you will die ALOT. You as a single player will never dominate anything or anyone for a length of time, its the teamwork that counts here. To me in this game repairing a Sunderer is totally as good as a kill, because ANYTHING you can do to help your teamates will help you win that base. This makes support classes really stand out in this game, but all classes really have a place in the action, with each able to make special contributions to whats going on in the battlefield. The same goes for the vehicles, from the Sunderer mobile spawn point and nasty tanks, to troop dropping airships and fast agile dogfighters, this is a game not to be missed!\n\nThis game easily makes my top 10 list of games to play before you die.\n\n10/10","December 12, 2015","true","658.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Massive amounts of players, all attacking each other at the same time, each with different sides, strategies and weapons. Pretty good maps, as well.\n\nThe classes seem rather basic at first, but then there are all the different weapons, upgrades, abilities and strategies that can be used with each one. A (seemingly) very well thought out game. It also incorporates the social aspect of gaming, by allowing the creation of outfits, platoons and squads.\n\nMy only problems with it are the not-so-brilliant graphics, mainly the player models, and the fact that a great deal of in-game items require game currency that needs to be purchased for real money, or a lot of farming (can you farm PCs, or is it an NPC-specific thing?). The grahics are, compared to those of some games, pretty good, but aren't great, even on the highest graphics quality setting. Overall, however, it is a pretty good game with some good ideas\n\nRating:\n\nGraphics: 6 / 10\nWeaponry (Variation): 10 / 10\nWeaponry (Realism): 9 / 10\nWorld: 9 / 10\n\nOverall: 8.5","December 14, 2015","true","15.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","1"

Yeah well you can't.\n\nSummary:\nThe game is epic and there are moments where you will ragequit because everyone has a better framerate and performance than you, but there are also moments when you stand on a hill and look at the 100 infantrymen running and gunning across a desert or some other flatland while fighters fly above and often get shot down taking a few infantrymen with them when they hit the ground. The game is also very grindy. You need to get good in order to get more certification points so that you can get even better. It's a never-ending cycle. On the other hand the game is also extremely rewarding. Your first NS-44 Commissioner bought for 1000 certification points (without involving real money) makes you wanna brag considering the fact you wasted about 2-3k cert points earlier for upgrades you thought were needed. Lastly, Planetside 2 WILL crash and it WILL have poor performance unless you have a top-notch rig or settings down low.","May 22","true","199.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

There are few other games out there that have this many players involved in the same battle, especially FPS games. The map is huge which means that there could be 3-4 large battles going on at the same time. You can go into battle on foot, vehicles or by air. However, you will have to get into a transport of some sort to get to the action unless you want to run for a good 20 minutes. The developers ensured quick methods of getting to the action by using a pod that lands right into the battle, personel carriers that allow spawns, and smaller base spawns. Once you are there, the battles can be overwhelming. You could have 30 tanks on your side against 100 infantry, or it could be 20 planes against your tanks. Each battle offers something different. Points are required to spawn vehicles and planes, and this is something great because it balances things out. The most impressive feature is the realistic aiming/shooting. The further away your target, the longer it will take your bullets to get there. You have to shoot ahead of your target to actually hit it. This counts for sniper rifles too. Recoil and aim shake are also well done. The game requires just enough skill to make it demanding, but without losing the fun aspect.\n\n5/5\n\nPay 2 Win: The game is free to play. However, people are able to buy weapons and skins for cash money. This is not a bad thing, they created a great game and need money. The only issue is that a lot of people do not like buying points or weapon packs. People would not mind buying the game after a free trial, but getting killed by some kids who bought all the best weapons makes me want to smash the screen. I am sure that a lot of players feel this way. In other words, the first 10 levels will be pretty rough. Once you get closer to 20, you should be racking up some nice points to buy upgrades for your guns and vehicles.\n\nSetting: You are located on some random planets with some random tech centers. Yes, very creative... There are 3 sides, names that I don't remember. First side is human, second is human on roids, third is alien human on roids (I think). They all have masks on so I honestly don't know... To break it down: The humans use cold war era weapons such as flak cannons, rpgs, and revolvers. The alien looking dudes use plasma cannons. I chose humans. Rage on... Other than that, there is not much going on. One map is winter, one is desert themed, and the third is jungle/forest. Some cliffs, hills, valleys and that is pretty much it. In my opinion, they could have spiced up the maps with some random structures.\n\n3/5\n\nGraphics: This game will demand a good computer. Even if you have a decent desktop, you will still need to reduce the settings. We are talking about 2000 people on one map with battles that have 200+ people on. Bullets flying over your head. 40 tanks shooting plasma cannons in your face. This is all pretty intense and it requires a good PC. The main issue is that the game will not load even on powerful graphics cards. This is a terrible mistake by the developers. The settings are automatically raised to high and it stops you from loading the game. Reduce the settings in the game folder to medium and you should be good to go.\n\n4/5\n\nOverall: If you are looking for large scale fights, this is it. Look no further. Everything else is a joke. Playing alone will get boring, so invite friends. Shooting down your first aircraft with an rpg will make you cry crocodile tears of joy.","January 23, 2014","true","179.0"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BrianReddus/recommended/218230/","BrianReddus","BrianReddus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BrianReddus/","353 products in account","When talking about Planetside 2, the discussion eventually becomes "What's the point?" and then a whole intervention is staged and we all ask them to go get help and we're all very supportive and in the end it all turns out that they meant "What's the point of doing X in Planetside 2?" Whoops.\n\nI may sound like an old war vet, but Planetside 1 had a lot of nice features that people refer to as "meta-game" that Planetside 2 seems to be missing.\n\nPS2 is a perpetual war: three distinct factions with their own pros and cons are fighting over the planet of Auraxis and its many continents. What's the end goal? â¥â¥â¥â¥ me if I know. The continents are filled with many bases and outposts that you must take with your faction. When you take that, you move on to the next, and the next, and the next... and eventually the enemy starts pushing back and you lose all those bases you just captured. It's one giant tug of war with no end. Even if you take every possible base on a continent, the enemy factions have permanent footholds on each continent, so they can just push right back with no reprocussions. PS1 had more than three continents and each faction had one permanent sanctuary on another island rather than footholds on each landmass.\n\nThere may be about 50+ bases in the game but it feels like there's only about 5-10 different base designs. Even though this game is still under constant development and base design changes are made often, they still feel like a patch job rather than a permanent solution... but to be fair, the original only had about 1 with very minor changes in between, but still...\n\nHowever - PS2, as a free to play FPS, is very good. (especially after the optimization update!) The community is also really great, and I reccomend finding a good outfit to play with for the best possible experience with this game. There's nothing like joining a squad of other players to give the push you need to get to that second base, or to that one point, or even to own the skies and destroy the ground.  The MMO of this MMOFPS really shines here. You can sometimes even join a group of random people and use the ingame VoIP to really get â¥â¥â¥â¥ done with perfect strangers who just happen to wear the same colors as you.\n\nIf you're wondering about the ability to pay for things, it's a bit all over the board, but mostly good. All weapons can be purchased through in-game cash, but those weapons can also be earned just by just playing and earning certs. Players can't buy upgrades for their classes, they have to earn those (but they can pay to earn them a bit faster.) Everything left over is just cosmetic.\n\nBut hey, it's free. Play it. Try it out. No harm to you. Just give it a shot and you might enjoy it. If not, uninstall and go back to whatever you like.\n\n\n\n","November 26, 2013","true","55.7"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

I spent countless hours in beta and actually counted hours post release playing with friends and strangers alike. But however with all that time to play all I can really do is give you a warning.\n\nThis game is not friendly to the solo and casual. You will struggle to find battles alone. You will struggle to improve your character on a few hours of play alone. You will struggle to play this game the way it is intended outside of peak hours. The monetization of this game is thick, with expensive guns and aesthetic items that will constantly eat away at your psyche. Strangers will be many and many battles forgettable as you continue to fight in a war with no real consequence.\n\nHowever: When you play this game with the way it is intended to be played. Large scale battles with hundreds of other players. Working with a small squad or a large platoon. You will have an absolute blast and I recommend every minute of it. But outside of prime time I really struggle to find something to do that I couldn't already do in the countless other smaller-scale, always available shooters like Battlefield, or Call of Duty, which will always have a nearly-full server waiting for you to join.\n\nSo find an outfit. Find a group of players that match your playstyle. Fight like hell.","December 3, 2013","true","530.2"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

There are times where I get framerates closer to 40-60, however, these times are few and far between, and only take place in desolate areas without players, vehicles, or even the simplest structure. I have other complaints about this game, although I'm sure other negative reviews already cover them, so I'll leave it to fellow dissapointed players to voice their opinions on the matter. I am saddened by my experiences with the game, especially due to how fun it seems it would be, if it were to run properly.
