Developed by Cosmillica and published by Sekai Project.\n\nThe storyReturning to Las Vegas after studying abroad on the island nation of Yamato, Jessica L. Huster comes back to lead her gang, “The 99th Floor,” only to find out that her family is in big trouble with the dominating mafia boss, Big E. Jessica and her friend Anna come together to face trouble head-on, however Jessica’s cousin, Very could turn out to be a “very” big problem for the both of them..\n\nThis adventure is unlike any you have previously experienced, and the girls in Atom GRRRL!! are anything but sweet. On the rough streets of America, scum emerges from the shadows at night, and so do these naughty girls as they go to reclaim their territory.\n\nThe humor is raunchy; the style is right out of a Tarantino film. In Atom GRRRL!! nothing is sacred and there is no right or wrong, it is simply just hardcore, in-your-face America. Follow Jessica L. Huster as she returns home to the crime-ridden streets of America in Atom GRRRL!!\n\nAudio and Visual elementsVisual elements – CGs are cute and are consistent with the character sprites which is a plus for me. But not really a fan of the backgrounds, as the backgrounds are actual images but with some filters applied. Well this is personal preference here as I would prefer a drawn background for sure.\n\nAudio elements – I really love the music used in Atom Grrrl!!! Its really catchy and awesome especially “Atombeat is Lovebeat” though my personal favorite is “Whole Lotta Love”. It features OP and ED videos,music player, and there is also full Japanese voice dub. About the Japanese voice dub it is relatively alright, but a character voice has brought my attention which is “Anna” her voice just does not suit her character overall. Anna looks cute but her voice is low so when I first heard her voice my reaction was ” o.O? Is that her voice?”\n\nTo Sum UpDo I recommend this visual novel? This is a tough one honestly so lets just say, I am taking on a neutral stand for this meaning yes I do recommend it but to a certain extent. Why to a certain extent you ask? it is just not my cup of tea overall. Well the humor value is great and its good if you are looking for something slightly different. But looking from a bigger perspective Atom Grrrl!!! as much I hate to say this there are better VNs out there that has yuri in it. The most it did was leaving a smile on my face and that’s it… I just can’t seem to get into the story despite it having humor value it fails to absorb me into the story. It feels like watching a comedy skit that is funny and wacky at the same time but just not interesting at all\nLastly I would like to thank Sekai Project for providing me a review copy.\n\nEdit: Some phrasing errors\n\nClick here for the full review!

Don’t take it seriously. The opening of the game says it all (if you already watched, you KNOW what I’m talking about. Big E’s “special weapon”, especially. That was… Yeah), so if you feel triggered/angered by racial slurs, tons of rude words, “stereotypical” characters, violence… This game isn’t for you. It will ♥♥♥♥ you off.\n\nBUT if you don’t mind and feel like reading something weird, go for it. Although, I recommend getting this game on a good sale; it’s not so short, but it’s quite expensive for a kinetic VN. Not worth paying the full price, in my opinion.\n\nThe art style is cute, BG and BGM were good. The VA was okay, I just found that men voices were a bit too low than the female voices. Intro and ending songs were also good.\n\n5/10. The story had potential, but I think they focused more on the crazy dialogues than the story itself.\n\nAnd by the way, here is my favorite dialogue:\nBig E: What a boring bunch. Don’t they have any balls?\nLackey 2: They died, so no, they have no balls.\nlol","April 2","true","15.1"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","8","8","2","0"

There is no 'straight man' (and here I mean the comedy stock character) to make it work.\nThe single relationship is rushed and is not really an integral part of the story.\nThe story structure is well thought out but incredibly short. There are a few parallel threads that intersect a few times then they all meet at the end. There I was expecting a big finale but it was over after a few lines. They wasted some good potential there.","March 4","false","2.1"," 15 of 22 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","15","22","0","0"

Huster and a group of crazy people after she makes her return to America from Japan. Throughout the ~2 hours of reading this VN will provide, your perspective will jump all over the place between all of the different people, and will sometimes cause you to go back a bit in the timeframe. This made the story a bit hard for me to follow which lead to a fair bit of confusion.\n\nI both liked and disliked the art style in this VN. I liked the look of the characters, but I did feel like it clashed with the photographs (with an added filter) that made up the backgrounds. The clashing of the text background with the text colour did make it hard to read at times as well, especially when combined with lighter coloured game backgrounds (and if I had it set so it wasn't see-through, I just couldn't see the text very well).\n\nAtom Grrrl is one of those games that is middle of the line for me. There were things that I enjoyed, but some other pieces majorly detracted from it. Do keep in mind that the game does not hold back and does talk about a lot of not-so-clean things, so if that is something that offends you then just stay far away.\n\nI give ATOM GRRRL!! a shaky recommendation, and really just suggest you try it out for yourself to see if it's something you'd like. Try and find it on sale if you can, since as I said it will only last you about two hours.\n\nDisclaimer: I was provided a key for review purposes by the publisher.","April 3","true","5.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Long story short, this is what happens when someone mixes Yuri with Pulp Fiction. Sounds awesome, right? Wrong!\n\nIt seems like a great concept but I'm pretty sure the developer was drunk and asleep when this was cobbled together. To start, when Pulp Fiction jumps around with the timeline, it's not too hard to follow. When I played this, I had to stop and think and try to decide where in the timeline it was with hardly any context. Next, the art is just pitiful. It looks like hentai flash games I played when I was in high school, only worse. I patched the game so I could get the full 18+ experience and half of the H scenes are just randomly thrown in there. I couldn't even fap to them and I wouldn't if I could.\n\nThe background music isn't too bad but I turned it off about midway through because it just grates after a while. There's lots of cursing and slurs used but they seem forced. Almost like the whitest kid you can think of in a slacks and a tie saying, "What's good, my n*****?" Just so ridiculous he wouldn't even get his ♥♥♥ beat. And the overall dialogue? I didn't laugh, I didn't crack a smile, I almost didn't bother reading the damn frames so I could get through it faster. But I didn't. I forced myself to read every word and I was done in a scant 77 minutes that still lasted entirely too long.\n\nThis game is a bigger disappointment than Panzermadels and I was actually aware of that games existence and following the news on its updates. It's just a cheap, boring ripoff of Pulp Fiction that actively tries to be bad. A flimsy script, lousy graphics, cheesy H scenes, and an ending that would fit better in some 80s American cartoon just makes me wish I had never even bought the game. The best part was the announcer at the title screen whenever you would mouse over an icon. Do yourself a favor and go use your money on something else. Don't even pirate the game. Just run.\n\n1/10","April 7","false","1.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
