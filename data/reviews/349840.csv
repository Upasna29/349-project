My view is a bit mixed in regards to this game - the strong core is there, though I do have a few concerns about the sustainability of the title, especially in terms of expanding content (as should be part of the plan for a game like this)\n\nPros:\n- Really nice map variance, with a good mix of layouts for capture points, obstructions, etc. (Each of the maps plays notably different)\n- Decent graphics (about on par with Forced)\n- Solid Gameplay\n- Easy to master controls\n- Fully unlocked camera (those of you familiar with 3d tactics games will know why I put that there, huge pro there)\n- Good Tutorial\n\nCons:\n- Lack of variety in cards (starting set is less than 50 cards)\n- Lacks financial sustainability for future expansions with the "Buy once, free forever" model (I would recommend skins/avatars/etc. as pay unlocks for at least some minor income to allow for additional sets, but I'm just a player, not a creator :P)\n\nNote: There is no single-player campaign to tell the story, I feel this is a flaw, but it may not matter to some people. The "single-player" is random battles vs the AI.\n\nNote: Press is really quiet on this game right now... so I'm not sure what the situation will be with multiplayer on release, but the game itself is fun at its core, just definitely needs more card variety (the map variety is actually fine for release... ).\n\nWhat it needs in my opinion?\n- More Cards\n- Single-Player Campaign (or challenge mode)\n- A steady source of income for sustained development\n\nI give it a thumbs up because the game itself is solid, though be sure to take the above into account.\n\nIf you would like to see the gameplay in action, I did create a video covering the game as well:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=534643331","October 13, 2015","true","15.4"," 36 of 44 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","36","44","0","4"

It's like hearthstone but you get to move the minions around the field and strategies way moore. I like the graphics and i like the whole concept of the game. There is only a couple of things, it's seems like if the other player gets ahead with something like 10 points it's really hard to comeback so the game is basically over at that point. Also it needs more cards, and i do hope they will add some as free DLC or something.","October 13, 2015","true","26.7"," 29 of 37 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","29","37","0","1"

The totems and the movement elements really do play out a chess like strategy back and forth with the opponent. But the interface does have some problems, especially for basics of strategy games that are standard for the genre, and they are standard for a reason. But in the end: the deck building mechanic is what kills it. With only 50 or so cards at this point, the customization that plays out is limited: and that's the bread and butter with card games at their core. They have promised free updates as the game goes along, and that's why this is something that may change my opinion and recommendation as it gets new updates. But as of right now: too little variety in a game that needs it tells me to give it a pass. But like always, check out the footage to see if it's right for you, because there is potential here.\n\nGameplay Footage and Video Review: https://youtu.be/hKejtAFCGcY\n\nLists:\n\n+:\nThe shaman mechanic does change the mechanics of the genre a bit and does work rather well, especially with the addition of victory points for taking the opponents shaman out.\nTotems and emphasis on movement and board control helps make the game have a good base strategy.\nAesthetic works in particular with ethereal themes. Good artwork overall.\nUse of colors draws natural attention to elements on the card you need to know.\n-:\nMissing content. There's a lack of cards, which unfortunately hurts the game in the long run. When you've got a deck customization, you need to this to have significance. It doesn't.\nThe UI needs work. Unable to see what characters have gone or attacked, and that's a standard in this genre for good reason. Seems really basic to overlook.\nAI is rather silly at times, and doesn't feel like a challenge.\nIt feels like an overlook to not have lore apart of this, especially with the Shaman aspect of it.\nSlow experience gain to unlock things, which seemed unnecessary for the amount of unlocks there.\nBugs here and there. Will be fixed in time, but crashed once, and ran into critical bug that stopped a game. That second one was identified to be fixed, but things like the UI sound setting not being saved is an example.","October 13, 2015","false","3.4"," 58 of 91 people (64%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","64","58","91","4","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/stellarcirclefive/recommended/349840/","stellarcirclefive","Stellar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/stellarcirclefive/","140 products in account","I'd like to preface this with something. Though I am the voiceover actor for Simo in Ancestory, I'd still like to write as concise and unbiased of a review as possible.\n\nAncestory is not perfect. It suffers from a lack of content and a dwindling playerbase straight out the door. But does this mean the game itself isnt worth the money? I'd probably say no.\n\nTaking inspiration from the very best TCG games and mixing it with a Fire Emblem esque grid system, Ancestory is a unique game for sure.\n\nGameplay:\nSimple and accessible, perfect to boot up against a friend every now and then. The game itself works with very few hitches, and runs at a snappy 60 FPS. The mix of minions and spells offer decent variety in strategy for the most part. Unfortunately, the overall card count is a tad low, and there are few comback mechanics to keep you invested in the event that your opponet makes a really good couple of plays early on. It's still fun and funtional, and that matters quite a bit.\n\nSound:\nThe music and sound effects get the job done, though they arent anything groundbreaking. The Desert Temple track is one I am particularly fond of though. Voice acting is generally pretty solid overall, with a few standout performances.\n\nVisuals:\nThe game has a cool neon aesthetic that helps to differentiate teams, and the color coded minions have their own unique flavor because of it. Nothing incredible, but it works.\n\nReplayability:\nThis is where Ancestory stumbles a bit. The card count is low, and the multiplayer community is very, very small. Until Kajak adds some more features, the game may be on the backburner.\n\nOverall Score:\n7/10\n\nAncestory is good, but it's held back by a pretty severe lack of content. Fifteen bucks isnt too bad, and will most likely be worth it once more content is added. If you want to buy Ancestory, know that you may need to come back to it every now and then to see the new content. If you want a cheap, neat little strategy game, I would still reccomend it.","October 20, 2015","true","3.5"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"

You capture and maintain monuments on the map to accrue points to win the matches.  Use mana to summon minions from your shaman and to cast various spells. There seems to be a wide variety of cards available.  There is also absolutely NO micro-transactions or any free to play mechanics, all of the cards are available to everyone through gameplay! Matches are available in single player campaign and online matchmatching.\n\nThe graphics are well made and pleasing to look at.  The maps are highly detailed and the entire game has a very polished feel to it.  The tutorial adequately explained the interface as well as the gameplay mechanics.  The camera can feel a bit jumpy, especially when rotating but it is a very minor issue.\n\nI highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed the gameplay in the video!\n","October 13, 2015","true","1.4"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","13","23","0","0"

Ancestory is kind of a combination between a card game and a turn based strategy game. The objective of the game is to gain points. You earn points by controlling totems or killing the other player's shaman.\n\nWhile there are more complicated card games on Steam, I liked that Ancestory decided to streamline the gameplay. The game doesn't require reading a lot of text on the cards or learning complex rules. You can pretty much learn the basics of the game within ten minutes and you can usually finish a game in around twenty minutes.\n\nWhile the game has a computer player to play against, I would highly recommend playing against another person since the AI is not particularly good and you can beat it pretty easily. The camera is a little hard to control at times. I also wish there were more cards in the game and that you would unlock new cards quicker.\n\nIf you are looking for an easier turn based strategy game that uses cards, I think you should enjoy Ancestory.\nNote: I received a free review copy of the game from the developer.\n\nRead My Full Review [www.geekyhobbies.com]\n","October 16, 2015","true","2.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Build a deck, get onto a map, use your minions to capture totems and make sure you keep them as long as possible. Reach the target score first. Rejoice.\nEven after just a few moments, Iâ€™ve already envisioned some specific decks based on cheesing the opponent, or creating huge creatures that are almost impossible to kill, or using spells to get my guys to the totems faster and then to protect them...the list can go on, and with new cards, new opportunities might come.\nBut all of this is in vain if there is no opponent to play against. The bots get tiring pretty fast and due to the small size of the community, the matchmaking takes ages. Maybe a free to play model with decks or expansions for pay wouldâ€™ve been a better idea for a game that absolutely needs a community to take off.\nFor now, I canâ€™t recommend a game in which the main part of it is practically unplayable (and I mean the multiplayer)\nWatch me play here : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyIw3xdEaLQ\n","October 19, 2015","false","6.0"," 4 of 13 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","4","13","0","0"

However, nothing has fixed it.\n\nI suspect this is related to multiplayer functionality or some kind of authentication. If you're going for single player, maybe you won't encounter the same issue.
