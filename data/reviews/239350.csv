On the inside, this is a very complex game.\n\nIn the beginning, you gleefully frolic through a beautiful system of caves hoarding every piece of shining gold or gleaming jewel in sight. "This is great!" you think to yourself as you open a chest full of rubies and emeralds. You start to whistle a tune as you delve deeper into the caverns. Then you see a golden idol. Excitedly, you grab it. The caves start to shake as a giant boulder comes tumbling toward you at high speeds. With a lucky jump, you survive the huge ball of death. A few seconds later, a spider comes out of nowhere and knocks you down a pit, where you're met with an angry old shopkeeper who is maniacally running, jumping, and firing his shotgun. You're struck with a bullet and sent over a ledge. As you slam into the ground, an arrow is launched from an inconveniently placed trap directly into your face. As you might imagine, you're now dead. Adding insult to injury, your lifeless corpse is flung directly into a pit of spikes.\n\nThis experience leaves you speechless. As you recover from this ordeal, you think to yourself "That wasn't fair." Little do you know, the whole thing was entirely your fault. You had failed to thoroughly scan your surroundings before grabbing that cursed piece of gold. Turns out, the boulder had obliterated an altar, causing a swarm of angry spiders to begin making their way to you. After this, the boulder rolled down a hole and smashed into the wall of a weapon shop, sending the shopkeeper into a violent frenzy. This is when one of the provoked spiders jumps onto your unsuspecting head and sends you to your doom.\n\nNearly everything in this game can lead to your death.\n\n\nThere are many lessons to learn in this game. With every run, you increase in knowledge and skill. Eventually you make your way out of the caves, and your in a foreign place filled with all kinds of new things that want to kill you. That blue frog looks kinda cute, right? WRONG. That "cute" blue frog HATES YOU. It will stop at nothing to murder you.\n\nWith every death and every success, you suddenly have a bunch of new questions. "What is that fleshy thing sticking out of the wall?" "What happens if I blow this up?" "Can I safely traverse this terrain?" "Why does that gravestone say 'Ash' on it?" You must find the answer to these questions. There is a great feeling of satisfaction and confidence every time you discover something new.\n\n\nOverall, Spelunky is an amazing game. It will not fail to entertain, and will keep you coming back for more. There is plenty to discover, with lots of secrets and surprises. It's very unforgiving, and you will have to be vigilent and persistent if you want to conquer it. The extremely challenging achievements assure you that there is always another goal to reach.\n\nGo ahead, give it a try. You'll be pleasantly surprised.","April 25, 2015","true","142.8"," 218 of 224 people (97%) found this review helpful 60 people found this review funny","97","218","224","60","2"

I am worlds better at it than I was when I first picked it up.  But on my best run I still haven't even gotten to the final world yet.  More often than not I can't even make it past the second world.  Truth be told, I just died on the very first level on the last game I played.\n\nSo why am I giving Spelunky a thumbs up?\n\nBecause the game is fun.  And fair.  Mostly fair, at least.\n\nLet's get this out of the way: Spelunky is a hard game.  30 hours in and I haven't even seen the final title set of the game.  But what keeps me coming back to it is that almost every time I die, it's my fault.  Spelunky rewards caution and harshly punishes hubris.  While learning the ins and out of the game can be frustrating in the beginning (unless you fear spoilers, I might suggest watching a Let's Play of the game before you start just so you don't immediately get murdered), the feeling you get once you get the hang of the enemies and traps is great.  By the time you feel start to feel overconfident, you make to the next world where the game humbles with new enemies and traps.\n\nTiki traps are still the bane of my existence, by the way.\n\nThe random generation of the levels keeps the game from feeling stale, even as you base your head against the same tile-set over and over again.  As I mentioned before, the game keeps things mostly fair, though I have run into a map generated in such a way that if I didn't have bombs I could not continue, but this has only happened once or twice in 200+ runs.  The traps and enemies are also mostly fair (outside of the occasional off-screen arrow trap that gets triggered before you can see it, and such).\n\nSo, seriously, if you have any stomach for rogue-like games, give Spelunky a try.  Please.  I could use some people new to the game so my score isn't consistantly at the bottom of the Daily Challenge anymore.","April 8, 2014","true","32.5"," 132 of 141 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","132","141","0","3"

Which leads into the leaderboards. With the leaderboards, the game lets you have a friendly competition with your friends, because everyone can compare their high scores. (There's even local coop!)\n\nThere's plenty of replayability in the game, as no level is ever the same. The randomized levels paired up with the different challenges that persist in each level extends the replayability even more. Your choices can have a large impact on your survival as well; Damsel is in the wall? Should you use your last bomb to free her? Maybe you should use the bomb to get rid of those pesky snakes first... Different choices can be life and death for you!\n\nI can definitely say that I'm in love with the game. I've played it once on the XBLA and thought nothing of it, but now that I really got into it, I've fallen in love. From the arrow traps, to the annoying bats, the game has a very charming feel. Even the art is adorable. All in all, the game is very original and not just another platformer game.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics are very smooth. I cannot see anyone putting this game down in the near future. It's just that fun. Why are you still reading this? Go purchase Spelunky now!\n\nHappy Spelunking!","August 11, 2013","true","40.7"," 182 of 217 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","182","217","0","7"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lesalanos/recommended/239350/","lesalanos","Trip Hazard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lesalanos/","382 products in account","At it's core, Spelunky is a precise 2D platformer, with a very simple yet elegant scoring mechanic. Each level through which you descend is littered with treasure, and your objective is to get to the end of the game, beat the boss, and escape with as much gold as you can carry with you. This would get a bit boring if the levels were the same every time, so instead the layout of the platforms, items and enemies changes every time you retry, although the four themed areas (plus one special, secret one) always appear in the same order. Interestingly, in this version, there is a daily challenge: a seed is generated and every one who attempts the daily challenge will play the same seed, and the scores are ranked at the end. Best I've achieved is twelfth in the world. Mind you, the disparity between my score and that of the person in pole position was enormous.\n\nIt probably took me a good twenty hours of practice before I could reliably make it to the second set of levels.\nYou can buy and find a variety of different items to help you proceed but you always start with just four bombs and ropes. Spelunky is a tough game, for sure, and you'll need to put the effort in if you want to see all that it has to offer. Although it is possible for RNG to generously hand you a seed with a few more items and a few less traps, the randomisation isn't so extreme that luck alone is enough to make or break a run. A skilled player will always succeed, no matter what, whilst someone who hasn't quite grasped the mechanics can have all the advantages and still squander them. Death in Spelunky often comes quite quickly, and cautious play is advised. As you practice, you'll learn how to be cautious and plan ahead, whilst still being very speedy and efficient with bombs and ropes. This is important, as levels in Spelunky are timed; when the clock hits 2:30, a ghost will emerge from the nearest wall and if it touches you, your run is over.\n\nIt really put me off at first, the idea that I couldn't take my time and explore all the nooks and crannies, hoovering up every tiny speck of gold as I went. But, the ghost is essential in encouraging you to get better, to find the fastest and most efficient ways down through the level, and skilled players can even exploit its appearance for fiscal gain. Like so many aspects of Spelunky, what seems like a hardship at first gradually reveals itself to be a boon. The angry shopkeepers, a real nuisance, but when you learn how to handle them, their shops become a little treasure trove for you to plunder. Could save you a few pennies in the black market, for sure.\n\nThey say the devil is in the details, and Spelunky is full of little flourishes which really vitalise the whole experience and imbue everything with character. Take the red frogs, for example. They explode on death (a problem, or a boon?) but if they go into water, even in their death throes, they'll transform into a blue frog. It's really neat discovering stuff like that for yourself, so, sorry for spoiling that one :P\n\nThere are loads of secrets too! Most levels have just one way out, but what happens if you try to get the crown from the skeleton in the haunted jungle level, and just what is the deal with that weird, tumorous growth sprouting from the backdrop? Does it have a use? That's up to you to find out, and you'll feel great when you do. Spelunky has produced more moments of elation and awe for me than any other game I've ever played, and I finished Dark Souls.\n\nListen, you owe it to yourself to play Spelunky. It might be the best game ever made.","November 9, 2014","true","392.3"," 111 of 121 people (92%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","92","111","121","7","0"

I kept dying, it seemed like they made the difficulty way too hard for a casual looking game.\n\nI picked it up again a few days ago with the determination to get through the first world, to have a proper idea of what the game is about.  Now I understand!!\n\nSpelunky looks easy.  If you've played it, you'll know it isn't.  The great thing is though, there are no cheap deaths.  Death comes from player error.  There are WTF!?  moments, but these are shortly proceeded by newfound knowledge and understanding of a new tactic or strategy.  The amount of ways to die in Spelunky, I don't even try to imagine!\n\nThis maybe what makes it such a special platformer.  With procedural generated levels and the multitude of ways our hero can meet his end, each playthrough feels quite unique.  It never feels mundane or like a grind.  Any frustration from dying is short-lived and usually accompanied with laughter.\n\nThe graphics are lovely and colourful, with a plethora of cute characters to unlock.  There's a whole host of tough achievements and a nice variety of catchy soundtracks that compliment it all really well.\n\nThis is how to make a platform game.  10/10","June 27, 2015","true","15.6"," 108 of 120 people (90%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","90","108","120","9","0"

I laughed. As someone who started with NetHack back in 1987 (yes, I'm old, thanks for noticing) and loved Moria and Dwarf Fortress, I just could not see how a platformer could possibly provide anything comparable to the same sort of play experience. Spelunky proved me wrong, in a big way.\n\nThe game starts out simple enough: spiders drop from the ceiling when you walk underneath, bats fly at you when you get close to them, snakes slither back and forth. Fine. You can run and jump, use a rope to climb to places you wouldn't otherwise reach, drop a bomb to bring down a wall or make a hole and get to otherwise unreachable areas. Cool. And each time you start the level has randomized elements so the walls and floors and treasure and monsters are in different locations so it's not predictable. Great. That alone would make a good game.\n\nBut as you advance, new enemies and items are added, along with special random areas. Each of these brings new elements that affect the gameplay not just for you but potentially with interaction with other items and creatures in the game. Very quickly your decisions become more complex. See the biggest spider you ever saw? Watch out, it's a lot harder to kill than a normal spider, so avoid at all costs... except if you kill it you can use the sticky webs to make your bombs attach to things they'd otherwise roll off of... which is fine if one blows up a higher part of the wall to get at a more valuable items but is not cool at all when you toss it at a monster who then comes chasing after you with a bomb stuck to its side ready to blow you up along with it... and even if you manage to get away it might accidentally destroy a floor you needed to run across or anger a shotgun-wielding shopkeeper or otherwise make your life more difficult. Do you do it? Decide quickly, because this isn't a turn-based game.\n\n\nAnd then, after many deaths and many hours, you realize that you are having to make split-second decisions about bizarre questions you never thought you'd ask yourself, like "Hey, would that giant yeti be destroyed by a land mine if I threw one just right, and is it worth trying to disarm one by hand to carry it around just in case?" or "How far do you suppose I'll bounce if I jump on top of this flying saucer, and does it change if I'm wearing spiked boots?" or even "Should I try to carry this damsel in distress over to the exit, throw her at the carnivorous plant, go find an altar to Kali, attach this sticky bomb to her while she runs off this ledge, use her as a living shield. drop her on that strange orange globular thing over there, or put her in this pit so I can grab that freeze ray gun and maybe just maybe come back for her later...?"\n\nYou will die. A lot. But on strictly a price of the game versus how many hours of enjoyment you get out of it comparison, this is the best bargain on Steam.","December 23, 2014","true","082.9"," 92 of 98 people (94%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","94","92","98","19","3"

Often a single mistake from certain death, you must depend on your own skills and knowledge to progress through the procedurally generated caves, uncovering the treasures and secrets that lie below. Death comes often, especially to newcomers, but every death is a learning experience that improves your chances of survival in subsequent attempts.\n\nSpelunky is a game that is simultaneously merciless and fair. Even with multitude of threats you'll face, almost every death you experience is preventable and the result of poor judgment or a lack of skill. All of Spelunky's mechanics and enemies follow a persistent and predictable logic, each element a tiny cog in a massive interlocking machine. Learning about the inner workings of Spelunky's world is necessary to venture into the deeper reaches of the caves.\n\nThose that are looking for an easy game to breeze through should look elsewhere, but those that desire a game that will test their skills as well as the speed and accuracy of their decision-making will likely enjoy Spelunky. Like many roguelikes, the initial difficulty is very high, and may be offputting to some, but those that persevere will be rewarded with an incredibly satisfying game that has nigh-infinite replay value and keeps even experienced players on their toes.\n\nBelow is a short story inspired by Spelunky, which may give a potential player an idea of how the game plays and what I find so appealing about it.\n\n/----After carrying both the valuable golden idol and the defenseless pug to the exit, I turned back to recover the shotgun that I had left on a perch high above, but partway through my journey, I felt a shiver run down my spine, and the air grew cold. It seemed that I had overstayed my welcome. Seconds later, I spotted the translucent spectre effortlessly slipping through solid wall, approaching me with single-minded determination. Having dealt with this ghost many times before, I was undeterred. I grabbed my shotgun and nimbly weaved my way through the twisted caverns as the sluggish spirit fell behind. However, as I neared the exit, something caught my eye: a lone supply crate sat at the end of a corridor, begging for its contents to be revealed. My desire for treasures overwhelming my senses, I made a dash for the crate, and within it I found a parachute. “Hardly worth the effort”, I muttered as I turned towards the exit, but as soon as I began to make my way back, I realized what a terrible mistake I had made. My unnecessary detour had allowed the ghost I had previously danced around with such confidence to corner me. I scrambled to blow open an escape route, but the walls that surrounded me were too thick, and the fuses on my bombs too long. Realizing the inevitability of my fate, I turned to face the approaching phantom and awaited its deadly embrace...\n\n...And as quickly as I felt my life being sucked away, I woke up at the cave entrance, no worse for wear. After taking note of my own death in a dusty old journal and etching another tally mark into the nearby stone wall, I journeyed yet again into the mysterious caves below, tightening the grip on my trusty whip as the surrounding rocks and dirt shifted under my feet. “This is the one” I assured myself as I entered an abandoned mine with renewed determination and a newfound respect for the ghost that haunts the caves below. “I just know it.”----/","November 1, 2013","true","446.0"," 121 of 139 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","121","139","0","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/blue_award/recommended/239350/","blue_award","Blue Award","http://steamcommunity.com/id/blue_award/","803 products in account","Very well designed torture 2D platforming roguelike. Superficially simple, but actually has lots of surprises in store and random level generation with randomized loot make for lots of replayability, if you get hooked. And to help you get hooked you have daily challenges to compare yourself to friends and community at large. There's also some local co-op if you fancy that (and have someone to play with).\n\nBeware though, this is truly a brutal game and takes heaps of time to master. It's very easy to lose health and rather hard to replenish it. It's actually pretty easy to outright die on some spikes, too, if you're not careful enough, but there's also a time limit to keep you on your toes. You can't simply crawl your way through checkpoints, once you die that's it, you restart from scratch with newly generated levels. That's the whole point of the game though, not to play some story or predefined levels but to continue playing it even if you've beaten it once already, to improve your score, or take less time, or find more secrets, or accomplish some self imposed challenges, or to compare yourself with others on a daily challenge, all that with a differently generated levels each time you play.\n\nI have to confess I played it for several hours (~15) and I haven't even been able to leave the initial few levels. In comparison by that time I killed mom in Binding of Isaac and mothership in FTL (albeit on easy, but still :D). Obviously the underlying genre in those games is different but I think some comparison is still valid. I most likely just suck with torturing 2D platformers. It's still fun though, up to a point however. You can suck only as much before you ask yourself are you willing to spend plenty of time to get better at this game and feel good about it, or just try a different title that isn't so brutally demanding.","December 30, 2013","true","15.4"," 62 of 69 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","62","69","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/G-Snake/recommended/239350/","G-Snake","G.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/G-Snake/","277 products in account","Murder, theft, kidnapping...how I became addicted to a game whose title doesn’t sound like a throwback 2D platformer.\n\nSpelunky, a game that looks like it was made by Nintendo and sounds like a special move in an adult entertainment production. To an outsider, Spelunky probably looks and seems like another goofy indie game with cartoony graphics and canned gameplay. That assumption couldn’t be further from reality, Spelunky is a brutal, unforgiving game requiring a high degree of skill and patience, while using it’s innocent, unsuspecting art to promote a violent and criminal plot following a degenerate tomb raider who makes Indiana Jones look like a choirboy.\n\nSpelunky is not only one of the best indie games I’ve played, it’s one of the best 2D platformers I’ve played to date (going back as someone who played terrible platformers on the Atari 2600). What makes Spelunky great is it’s addictive, procedural level design that rewards patience and strategy while punishing recklessness, dying is extremely easy so each death serves as a lesson to hopefully teach your dumb ♥♥♥ how to navigate for the next playthrough. People with ADD or those who enjoy being guided through games with relatively no resistance (99% of modern games) will have a tough time with this game as they’ll die 20 or 30 times before making it through the first world and will likely rage quit. There are times where Spelunky is so brutal that instead of getting angry, you’ve reached the stage of delirium where you begin to develop a psychotic laugh when you save up 10 hearts, make it to the ‘last’ level, take a safe step to the right, activate an arrow trap, get smashed in the face, get thrown across the level, bounce off 3 walls and then somehow land in a pool of lava even after your carefully planned and executed run up until that moment. At that point, anger is futile, enjoy the hilarity and get your ♥♥♥ back to the cave.\n\nGameplay\n\nIn terms of gameplay, Spelunky is a rogue-like where you aim to complete levels across 4 or more worlds while ‘collecting’ treasure, ‘defeating’ monsters and ‘rescuing’ damsels (stealing precious metals, murdering innocent wildlife and kidnapping unsuspecting civilians). The gameplay promotes careful, thought-out movements and actions but the controls are so tight and responsive that you can hold turbo like an idiot (like I normally do) and try to fly across the map while getting every last resource even if it means a tragic and boneheaded death, that’s the allure of Spelunky, like dating a girl fresh out rehab, the potential is there but it’s likely going to end in disaster. With that said, to maximize enjoyment and effectiveness in this game, I’d highly recommend using a controller, preferably the Xbox 360 one, I couldn’t imagine playing this with a keyboard. During your crime-filled adventure, you’ll come across a variety of weapons, items and powerups, because of the procedural nature of the game, you can’t really plan on getting certain items since there’s no guarantee they’ll even show up, randomization does that. It is a double-edged effect however, there are runs where you’ll get more than you can carry; a jetpack, plasma cannon, all the good boots, 15 hearts (my record is 18) and still have to sacrifice some of it if you want to reach certain areas of the game.\n\nReplayability is at the same level as The Binding of Isaac, a game that I dropped over 300 hours into. There’s so much to do in Spelunky that you should easily have hundreds of hours of gameplay, the average ‘run’ takes about 30-40 minutes if you’re taking your time and trying to get as much loot as possible. Games like these are a great change of pace because they aren’t a huge time commitment like most PC games are (looking at you Civ 5) and they allow you to sit back and relax with a controller (although there’s very little relaxing in this game unless you’re on some strong tranquillisers). At writing, I’m about 130 hours in and I finally reached hell for the first time this past week, just to paint a picture of how much time is needed in order to get good enough to beat the whole game. As if the game couldn’t get any better, it also has a deathmatch and co-op mode, which is likely not as big of a deal for PC gamers since it’s only offline (no online co-op does suck, but is a very small issue), still something fun to play if you’re sitting around with some friends and everyone has controllers.\n\nAnother gameplay element worth mentioning is destruction, although explosives are relatively hard to come by, when you stock up enough of them you can start to take chunks out of the level to try and access loot. The levels are varied but consistent, you won’t be able to get all of the loot in every level but if you’re resourceful and strategic you should be able to clear out 90% of the content while avoiding death at the end (play the game to find out what I mean). The items are also pretty well crafted, they all have literal uses and as you play the game you’ll realize they have secondary uses. The design choices in Spelunky were really well thought out and are all there to help improve the gameplay, which is all that should matter. When you’re over 100 hours in a game and still discovering cool gameplay mechanics that only make the game experience better, you know the developers put a lot of thought into the design.\n\nVerdict\n\nIt’s a shame that a lot of people will never play a game like Spelunky because of their preconceived notions regarding indie games, platformers, colourful artwork, a game that only costs $15 or less (I only paid $4 thanks to a trusty Steam sale), or games that sound like degrading sexual escapades. In any event, it’s your loss if you’re reading this and still are not convinced. If you’re too cheap to buy the game for $15, add it to your wishlist and get it on sale, even if you’re too useless to ever play the game, at least you’ll have supported a developer who if more companies took after we’d have a new era of engaging, thought-provoking games that reward skill and strategy instead of spamming you with ‘achievements’ just for booting the game up while it carries you through the entire experience with no challenge[www.battlefield.com].","March 17, 2014","true","172.8"," 54 of 57 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","54","57","0","2"

These people have clearly never played Spelunky.  Never has a game filled me with such rage, with such hatred, with such contempt as Spelunky.  The designer of Spelunky, Derek Yu, rarely leaves his home without a\nbodyguard.  Identifying himself as "the guy who made Spelunky" usually ends with him being unceremoniously punched in the nose.\n\nIs it a great game?  It most certainly is.  It may be the greatest game ever conceived. It's challenging, it's unpredictable, it's full of depth and secrets.  It looks and sounds great and it controls well.  It is  impeccably well-designed.  Even after a thousand attempts, you won't have mastered it.  Each time you play, you may learn a new detail to improve your play.\n\nAnd yet, suffer you will.\n\nEventually, you'll take to the internet for help.  You'll read wikis.  You'll read strategy guides.  You'll watch jerks on Twitch TV making the game look easy.  You'll watch videos on YouTube of people beating the game in less than five minutes.\n\nAnd yet, your nearly every attempt at the game will end in tears.  You'll be left wishing you had just one more bomb, just one more rope.  You'll be wishing you had robbed that shopkeeper when he had a jetpack.  You'll be wishing you never entered that cursed black market.  You'll swear that getting through the giant spider level in the dark was impossible.  You'll play the Daily Challenge religiously, every day, always to be beaten by at least a hundred other players.  You'll finally, finally, make it to the super-secret level, and then be killed instantly.\n\nAnd yet, continue you will.  For Spelunky is more than a game.  It is a self-fullfilling insanity loop.  It is a labyrinth of aggravation, addiction and delayed gratification in which your retribution and rewards are always within reach, yet inexplicably never attainable.\n\nSoon the only thing you'll hate more than Spelunky will be yourself.  Every missed jump, every wasted bomb, every poor decision, every careless death will tear another tiny piece from your heart.  Finally, reduced to a soulless husk, clutching a battered gamepad, you will still find the energy to tap X to try again.  Just one more time.  And instantly regret it.\n\nDo I love Spelunky?  I certainly do.  Do I recommend you drown in the same river, born of my tears, that I've swum in?  No, I do not.","November 28, 2014","false","223.1"," 783 of 1,211 people (65%) found this review helpful 759 people found this review funny","65","783","1","759","35"

Yes, it's very hard. But yes, it's one of the most enjoyable games I've ever played. Thanks to its randomly generated levels, the replayability is almost infinite. What's absolutely delightful about Spelunky is that it's one of those "perfect" games. That means that you'll always know why you lost a game, and how you could improve. There are hundreds of tiny tips and tricks to know and discover, and the "secret" levels are always a joy to go through.\n\nSpelunky can please the most hardcore players, but it also allows a more casual gameplay. People will either want to complete the game as fast as possible, or with the biggest amount of gold, or simply try and beat the final boss. In the end, what's the most amazing thing about this game is that you won't necessarily play it for its entended purpose (beat the game, deliver damsels, get treasures..), but rather for the journey you'll embark whenever you press Start.\n\nAbsolutely amazing game, I couldn't recommend it enough.","October 14, 2014","true","65.1"," 42 of 48 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","42","48","0","4"

It has a plethora of items, enemies, and level types. It is a fairly challenging game, which can be played by yourself or with up to 3 others. However, the co-op mode is bad since all players are forced on the same screen. Overall this games comes highly recommended from me because of its difficulty and replayability.\nThe Good:    Solid controls. Whether you are using a controller or keyboard, the controls feel very nice and there is no input lag.\nRandomly generated levels. Every level in Spelunky is randomly generated, making it very fun with high replayability. No level feels the same. The levels generate nicely, not once has there been a time where the exit was blocked or something else was wrong.\nDaily Challenge The Daily Challenge is a randomly generated level that is the same for everyone. It is different everyday and can only be played once that day. That way everyone has the experience. Scores are recorded on a leader board. This keeps the game interesting after you've played it a lot and gives a reason to come back.\nLots of items and enemies. Plenty of items and enemies are included in the game. There are some that are only found in certain levels, and others you'll see every run. Also, there are unlockable and playable characters hidden in the game that you can find.\nLevel variety. There are multiple different level themes: mines, forest, ice caves and the temple to name a few. There are also several hidden worlds with their own themes that you can find. Also, some levels have different 'feels', which add different layouts and mechanics to the level.\nDifficulty. Spelunky is a very balanced game. It has just the right difficulty where you will always blame yourself for failing, and start another run because this time you will do better. It may seem unfair at first, but after playing several times you will understand the mechanics better and how to fix your mistakes.\nGraphics. The HD graphics that Spelunky uses are absolutely beautiful and fit the feel of the game nicely.\nDeathmacth. The deathmatch co-op mode has plenty of different levels, which can be unlocked by playing the main game. It is a highly entertaining mode, although the bots are a bit dumb at times.The Bad:    The ghost. After spending exactly 2 minutes and 30 seconds in a level, a (basically) invulnerable ghost will appear. It will kill you immediately if it comes in contact with you. Personally I do not mind this, but I put it in the bad section because it seems to annoy a lot of new players.\nCo-op. In Spelunky, you have the option to do a run with up to three other players. The downfall of co-op is that every player shares the same screen. There is no split-screen. This can cause many issues such as a player falling off the screen, forcing players to go the same speed, and more.\nOff-screen occurrences. Sometimes things that happen off-screen, such as a poisonous snake spitting on a shop keep,  can ruin an entire run. This is obviously not the players fault and can be very disappointing when it is the cause of your failure.","June 17, 2015","true","122.0"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","95","21","22","3","0"

It is a fusion of the genre defining games of yester years, with mechanics and visuals that will stand the test of time. It's a simple concept. Get your character to the end of a level. What happens in between your starting point and exit are the moments that will have you yearning for just one more attempt. At first, the game is presented as a deep mystery, but after many trial and errors, you will slowly become the master of it's secrets.\n\nWhat initally feels like clumsy controls, and unfair gameplay eventually reveals itself to be much more than that. At your peak, you'll find yourself exploring the worlds randomly generated caves with precision, all well collecting gems as if you were pac-man. Completing the game is a hurdle in itself. But once you do, you'll only discover that there are more mysteries in the world of Spelunky.\n\nThis games magnum opus though comes from what at first glance seems to be unappealing and daunting. The daily challenge. Every player is given the same random world, with only one chance. Even once you've grown comfortable with Adventure mode and your skills as a spelunker, you suddenly have an audience, and your every move counts. There will be times you make mistakes from the desire of the seven sins, but you'll always have tomorrow to prove yourself again.\n\nThere is no real way to explain Spelunky's tragicomedy nature, you just have to discover it for yourself. It is definitely the type of game you need to invest yourself in, or you'll find yourself empty handed and frustrated. There aren't many games that are collectively considered one of the greatest. Spelunky without a doubt, is one of them.","December 14, 2013","true","311.2"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","0"

But the question I ask, as an adult with limited free time, is this: Why are those skills that one would want to build up? What is it that makes it worth it?\n\nIn a game like FTL you've got the overarching narrative of the rebellion to keep you hooked in, with a unique story path each time. This is just a vague 'let's explore a hole in the ground' storyline that isn't exactly compelling. There's no payoff other than a scoreboard and achievements. And that's not really enough for me.\n\nSmall frustrations also are quite irritating. On three occasions, I've spawned in a level, heard an environmental explosion go off in the distance and had a shopkeeper or Kali shrine get caught in it and immediately blame me. Annoying.\n\nI certainly got a fair few hours out of it. But I'm just not having fun.

But if you like the challenge of mastering character mechanics and learning how to survive in tough situations then this game is perfect for you. I'll break down the very basics of each "category" to games.\n\nVisual/hearing: You'll probably know if you'll like the graphics based on the pictures above but what suprised me was the games fluidity. It never lags and everything just runs smoothly into itself. The music is fun and adventurous which fits the game perfectly.\n\nControls: I use an x-box controller which I recommend highly. The controls are easy to learn but hard to master. Their are small quirks and tricks that you figure out for yourself as you progress.\n\nGameplay: There are many different paths you can use to be succesfull in this game. There are plenty of items to choose from and with the randomization you'll never have the same experience. The game is extremely hard so unless you want to spend at least 2 hours or so getting good enough to relax a bit this might not be for you.\n\nOverall this game is amazing. People's only turn off is the difficulty and timer but thats the point of the game. Plus the payoff is great once you reach new levels, just like beating a boss in dark souls haha.","June 19, 2015","true","19.5"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/recommended/239350/","maudish","Audish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/","908 products in account","Spelunky will always have a special place in my heart. We go way back, back to when it was a freeware release that I stumbled across in my treks across the online wasteland. It was actually the first roguelike game I ever played, leading me all the way back to the origins of the genre. So while I can certainly recommend Spelunky as a gateway roguelike, I'd be happy to explain all the other purposes I can recommend it for.\n\nYou play as the most adorable button-nosed spelunker imaginable, Indiana Jones fedora and whip and all. Dropped into a series of randomly-generated platform levels, you must navigate the deadly traps of the mines, jungles, and stranger places in search of fantastic treasure. There's plenty of gold and jewels lying around, along with a wide assortment of tools and weapons, everything from climbing gloves to jetpacks, boomerangs to freeze guns. While each level is navigable just by running, jumping, and mantling, there are untold options for getting through each by using your supply of bombs or other means to clear out parts of the terrain, or your climbing ropes to scale otherwise impassable heights.\n\nIt's the huge wealth of options presented right from the start that makes Spelunky such a joy, and those extend to the hilarious ways you can die, too. Almost everything in the game has weight to it, and can be deadly if sent flying in just the right way. Arrows from arrow traps can bounce and deflect, thrown stones can ricochet back, and even the otherwise harmless debris from explosions can trigger other traps or blasts. The enormous number of interactions between the elements of the world means that many of your deaths will be cartoonish, Rube Goldbergian chains of mishaps that start with you dropping a skull onto a trap and end with you and half of the level crushed into a pit of lava by a giant rolling boulder.\n\nRare is the game that makes the failures as satisfying as the successes, but Spelunky does it with reckless abandon. Once you learn the quirks of the game, though, there are plenty of secrets and challenges besides just winning. Hidden levels abound, there's a chain of secret items that can lead you to a fantastic city of gold, and the most daring among you can attempt the hellish alternate ending. Along the way there are damsels to save, stores to peruse, and tunnels to dig, all logged in collectable style in your journal. There's also daily challenges and local co-op if you've decided you're tired of having friends, because there is no way you won't "accidentally" kill them about a thousand times. But when even death is this fun, it's hard to complain at all.","December 22, 2015","true","11.0"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","13","18","0","0"

Although it does have some flaws (can only use keyboard or XBox controller, can be kinda inconvenient. And some other things), it was really fun to play even though I sucked utterly at it. It kept me going for the 123 hours I have in the game, and I haven't gotten far into the temple which I've only made it to twice or so. Good luck trying to beat this game, and I'm sure it's extremely satisfying even though I haven't made it their myself. I would be so relieved if I made it there though. With the added competition of Daily Challenge, which are pretty fun to compete against friends in although you're all in separate worlds, the game reaches a new level of depth and makes it more of a community game than just a solo game. The one thing I'm waiting for in this game is online multiplayer, probably through steam, so you can actually play with your friends and beat the game together.","February 15, 2014","true","123.5"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Not because it's one of those "hard indie platformers." In fact, it's only superficially a "hard indie platformer." Through that lens, Spelunky begs to be played with the run button held down the entire time. However, until you've gained some experience with the game it's likely you won't progress very far until you slow down. Once that progression occurs, the game's secrets begin to open up little by little. There's so much to uncover and unearth here and nothing really holding your hand telling you how to find it.\n\nThere's a constant sense of adventure and exploration because of the superbly psuedo-random levels. Even after seeing all there is to see and after countless runs, the game is still challenging and fresh.\n\nThis is a fantastic game. Anyone who enjoys difficult platformers, roguelike-like games, and/or games themed around Indiana Jones owes it to themselves to give Spelunky a look.","January 6, 2014","true","193.3"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Let me start off by telling you that Spelunky is frustrating. Really frustrating. Extremely frustrating. I'm serious, this game WILL make you mad. This game isn't fair either, it has things that pop up out of nowhere and kill you, it has traps that you cannot get past, it has enemies placed so dreadfully annoyingly that it makes you want to cry. But, it also has adventure. No matter how many times I failed, how angry I got, how unfair this game was, I came back. I wanted, no, I needed to beat this game. I came back time and time again, mostly minutes after ragequitting, to beat the living ♥♥♥♥ out of that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of a boss and claim victory. This game is luring like that. At the moment, after 30+ hours of struggling, I have finally defeated Olmec, the first boss. I haven't really done anything worth mentioning beside that, but that was an accomplishment of sizes unheard of. I never really feel proud when I beat a game, but holy hell was I proud when I stomped that Olmec. That was truly hard, and it takes pure skill, experience and a controller to pull off. No seriously get a controller for this, you will not enjoy playing without one, I guarantee it. Anyways, here's my signature point-based review to explain more clearly why this game is amazing, and why it's a piece of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥.\n\n+It's devilishly addictive. Now I never get hooked on any 'addictive' game ever (I usually think they are ♥♥♥♥, like Angry Birds), but I am hooked on this. Now that Olmec is actually dead, which took over 30 hours to accomplish, I still have much harder objectives left. Like reaching the City of Gold or killing Yama, to mention a few. So it even hooks players who are not into 'addictive' games.\n\n+It's an adventure in every sense of the word. Seeing what the next level is like is a crazy exciting and discovering one of the million billion secrets is pure awesome. It's India Jones-esque. There is adventure in every corner. I suggest not watching playthroughs or tips and tricks untill you beat Olmec because that doesn't really need hints, and figuring things out for yourself is crazy fun. All those secrets and everything are awesome. After beating Olmec you'll need every tip you can get, and watching playthroughs is a good way to see what you missed. But this adventuring is fun. Do a lot of it before spoiling the game for yourself.\n\n-It's hard, and not in a fun way. This game does not like you, at all. You will die a million times because of stupid things you didn't even know, and especially when you just got that rare item you never get you'll die because you don't know how it works. Spelunky has over a million different ways to die, and when you want to avoid dying, you need to know every single danger at effect from any item/enemy in the game. And knowing everything you shouldn't do takes a lot of doing things you shouldn't do. Just try and remember that every time you die, you learned that you shouldn't do that particular thing and next time, you may avoid that mistake and get further. It takes hours of experience and a million deaths to beat this game, keep that in mind. Every death is a step closer to the end.\n\n+It's easy to sneak a run inbetween things. Your typical Spelunky run at my level takes about 15 minutes, but even beating the game shouldn't take much longer than half an hour, which makes it really easy to 'just try once more'. Of course you always end up playing for hours on end, then ragequitting and then immediatly picking it up again to try again. But the point is that, would you have to wait for about half an hour, you could boot this ol' gem up instead of boring yourself because a DOTA 2/LoL match takes too long to sneak in there.\n\n-Spelunky is forged in the pits of hell by evil trolls that feed on the tears of mortals.\n\n+Killing a boss is the best thing ever. It is. You will not comprehend how proud I was after beating Olmec, and that was only the beginning. The thing about Spelunky is that every death makes you want to beat it more. And after dying a billion times, I felt the feeling of beating a billion games all at once. It is awesome. So ♥♥♥♥ing soothing. For a few hours after beating this game, nothing matters. All is right because you beat Spelunky. I can only imagine what defeating Yama feels like. Just, awesome. It's what you play for, the feeling of beating it. It almost makes up for all the frustration caused by dying.\n\nIn total, I don't even know if I like Spelunky, but it sure is worth experiencing. Probably the game that left the biggest impression on me after Super Mario 64. Spelunky is, in one word, majestic.","January 8, 2014","true","94.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","1"

One wrong jump can send you bouncing through every trap in the level, spitting you out in a dead lump on the floor.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/baeyi/recommended/239350/","baeyi","Ecstasy Bae","http://steamcommunity.com/id/baeyi/","134 products in account","I’ve never rage-quitted a game more than this, but the magic of Spelunky keeps me going back for more – adventure, the sense of achievement, or just to ♥♥♥♥ the shopkeeper off.\n\nOriginally posted by ign.com:I see a vine rope just out of reach, but I’m sure I can make it. With a distressed damsel in tow and a monkey looting my backpack, I take a daring leap. I land face-first in a spike pit, killing the lot of us, losing thousands of dollars in collected treasures.\nThere's no turning back once you've bought Spelunky. Even if you're not a fan of platformers, give Spelunky a chance, and you'll never see platformers the same way again. Judging by the lot of wasted hours I've spent on this game, there's only two outcomes you'll get after playing a few (or ten times more) rounds - rage-quitting because you got nibbled by a bat, or celebrating because you've successfully led the shopkeeper into your strategic trap.\n\nAlthough Spelunky might seem like an easy adventure game, my hours in this game have never got me past Level 3-1 (i.e. Ice Caves). It took me more than a month to discover Level 2-1 (i.e. Jungle) but the sense of achievement made it all worth it. Even though I've been stuck in the Mines for a hell lot of time, I'm still surprised at the wonders it can create. There are so many mysteries to the game that even being in the same location wouldn't make it boring. From trying to sacrifice two damsels within the same location, to getting the key to the chest, or finding the Black Market in the Jungle, the yearn to play Spelunky never ceases.\n\nIn my opinion, Spelunky is also a game of speed, skill and strategy. One example would be the many ways to survive the arrow trap, which would cause you a minus two health if shot. Personally, I know three options, though I mostly use two and there may be more out there. You could take the risk and jump, while whipping the arrow with a carefully timed hit. Or, throw an item infront of the trap, be it a bomb, rock, damsel (I'm sorry.) or an arrow from another trap. Get a taste of your own medicine! The last option would be leading a monster close enough to the trap without endangering yourself, such as a spider or bat, but you'll need to be pretty lucky for them to spawn near the trap.\n\nI guarantee you lots of "Oh, ♥♥♥♥!" or "What the hell?" moments as you venture through the forever changing walls of Spelunky. Ranging from times when the stupid damsel decides to suicide into the spikes, to times when you did so much to please Kali and she gives you smoke, and smoke only. There will also be times of laughter (not to forget tears of pain and disappointment) when you hopelessly fall into a river of piranhas and somehow manage to survive with one health left.\n\nI would definitely recommend this game if you're a fan of platformers or roguelike games, or if you just have too much times in your hands and are hoping to find a game to waste your time. Even if you aren't, I'll urge you to give it a try!\n\nI may have missed out a point or two, but I hope you get my message! Spelunky is an awfully awesome game, and I believe it definitely has a spell casted on it or something for me to keep wanting to play even though I've died close to 1000 times.","July 10, 2014","true","539.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

D'ya like roguelikes? D'ya like vague history? Cause buddy, this game has it all!\n\nStarting out as a freeware game (still available to download), Spelunky looked like a more colourful NES game, having a lo-res style. The premise was simple: collect money in a randomly-generated cave and don't die. Between you and victory stood monsters, traps, and ornery shopkeepers. Whilst the HD version is superior, the regular version has some differences that make it worth playing at least once.\n\nThe Steam version is a lot more fun to play. There's multiple unlockable characters to find, each separated only by how they look. You won't be forced to choose one character because they get more bombs or anything - everyone is the same apart for how they look. Spelunky also offers several bonus levels for people who can figure out how to access them, as well as wondrous prizes and weapons for anyone that can survive them. A lot of the things you can find in the stages are linked to different historical periods (mainly Egyptian, but there's also Mesopotamian and Chinese beings appearing in the game)\n\nAnd if you don't like how things look in the game? Mod it! Find a sprite sheet, or make your own, and you can play as whoever you want! You wanna be Mario? You can be Mario! You wanna be Solaire of Astora? Someone's put up a sprite sheet for that already! You can even replace one skin so that in-game, your character sparkles!\n\nThere's also local multiplayer you can play with friends! Play through the adventure mode to teach those monsters who's boss, or play Deathmatch to see who's the TRUE king of Spelunky! Daily Challenges help to keep you sharp at the game whilst also letting you see who's the best at a specific level seed, and the achievements can give you ideas of what to do if merely beating the game isn't enough for you.\n\nJust remember: this is a roguelike game, so expect to die. A lot. The game will only go easy on you once, and that's in the mandatory tutorial. After that, you're getting the same treatment as everyone else. And if you can meet the challenge, you'll be handsomely rewarded.\n\nGet this game!","March 31, 2014","true","132.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Relsre/recommended/239350/","Relsre","Relsré","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Relsre/","31 products in account","Spelunky is a very simple concept at it's core...it's a 2D platformer, a hard-as-nails arcade adventure platformer. Spelunky takes this simple Indiana-Jones-ish concept and presents it nigh brilliantly. It is an easy to learn, hard to master (or even complete!) game.\n\nI personally love this game for its tight controls, and the fact that every delve into the mysterious caves is different...each level is procedurally generated, and is done so in a way that is navigable, unique, fair and exhilerating to delve into almost every time.\n\nIt should be stressed though, that the game is challenging, and can throw people off with its misleading learning curve. Spelunky is a permadeath game, and as much as the trailer and (adorable!) aesthetic gives the impression you're going to explore and take in many places at once, it's more likely that newcomers will spend a while fumbling in the Mines, befor they get to the different biomes.\n\nFortunately Spelunky is easy to pick up, with its rather spartan control scheme. Aside from the standard directional movement, you have four other actions: Jump, Whip (or Action key, if you're holding an item), Throw Rope, and Throw Bomb. The controls are tight, polished and fair; challenge comes in how you deal with enemies, use your items, and navigate levels.\n\nOne thing the trailer doesn't mention is the fact that each level, apart from the boss levels, implements a 'soft timer' of sorts -- a slow-moving instakill Ghost appears and chases you on the map after 2 mins and 30 seconds. I think the trailer is partly to blame for this, as this isn't a game where you can 'stop and smell the flowers'. I did mention that it is a 'soft timer' though -- you can easily dodge the Ghost if you've got the platforming chops. The Ghost isn't that much of a deterrent as some other reviewers make it seem.\n\nIf anything, the Ghost teaches us that we must value our time; Spelunky isn't a game about collecting everything, all the gold...because really, you don't need to! No, Spelunky is a game that teaches us to make the best out of every situation. Once you know that, Spelunky is your oyster! Although a seemingly simple platformer, Spelunky hides many secrets: you can find guns that shoot Plasma blasts -- levels inside of a huge subterranean worm...and oh yes, how about Hell itself? As the trailer suggests, there is so much to explore!\n\nNot to mention, the mechanics of this game don't only affect the player; everything is designed to interact intricately with each other. See that Snake slithering past an arrow trap? BOOM, it's now a shower of blood. That lava pot in the Jungle? You can pick it up, but don't spill it...a Lava Man will arise, mindlessly burning both you and your primitive cousins. That podium of gore that is Kali's sacrificial altar? Better not fall stunned onto it...or hey, experiment and see what happens! It's amazing the amount of things you can do inside Spelunky.\n\nMore of an Achiever? The game offers a 'Daily Challenge' mode too: once a day, you can play through the same level layouts, or 'seed' as others -- you've got one shot at it, and once you've died (or survived!) your score (money) and level at which you died at will be ranked with other players who played the same 'seed' on a leaderboard. Very neat feature to see how well you're doing, and there's still a steady audience playing through those. Steam Achievements are here too...good luck getting all of them, they're not easy to obtain! ..and not in the traditional 'die 1000 times to a Snake' either. Most of these, such as picking up no gold at all, or saving 8 Damsels in one delve, require real skill to obtain.\n\nOh yes, did I mention multiplayer? Yes, you can explore the depths with up to 4 of your friends! Friendly Fire is present though, so do actually respect each other for once...or not~! There's also a Deathmatch mode, where you can pit your platforming skills against each other and toy with a variety of items and settings -- it's great fun too.\n\n...hey, maybe you and/or some of your buddies aren't feeling up to the challenge of Spelunky...and that's okay. I, in my very humble opinion, think Spelunky is one of the best games ever. To me, my many deaths are part of the experience. Spelunky teaches you to enjoy, and relish the journey more than the destination: to appreciate the variety of lush environments and situations the game presents, as well as your own platforming mastery. When you finally manage to survive and return from the caverns alive, for the first time...oh, what an amazing feeling that will be, you've come so far!\n\nI'm rambling, aren't I. Thank you for reading this far. Up to the challenge? Try it!\n\n...Maybe, just maybe, you'll like it too. :)","December 31, 2015","true","183.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

The game has randomly generated caves, so every time you try the game again, it will be different, with the exception of the daily, where everyone plays the same cave within 24 hours to see who gets the most gold or the fastest time.\n\nThe controls are simplistic, having a simple attack, that can be upgraded by obtaining guns. Most of the gameplay is looking for gold to spend at stores, to get better equipment and getting further down. The arsenal is pretty decent, ranging from freezing guns, to shotguns, and plasma cannons. There are also passives, like climbing gloves, jetpacks, and others.\n\nThere are 3 resources that need to be managed: Health, bombs and ropes. Ropes and bombs can be obtained by bags and crates, and health can be obtained by rescuing a damsel (that can be a girl, guy or a dog) and bringing them to the level exit. The shops usually have 4 items that you can buy or steal, considering that the shopkeeper will seek revenge through the whole game if you steal his items.\n\nWhilst the game is extremely difficult, it is very fun and rewarding. It has great replay value and has tons of secrets that can let the player play it for around 150 hours. Definately worth it.\n\n8.5/10","November 30, 2013","true","367.8"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","1"

The levels are randomly generated and the gameplay is always pretty fair. The art is beautiful and everything works like it should. Just watch a youtube video if you're not sure.  But I can't recommend this game more highly. It is my favorite cave-themed indie game. Below is an attempt to capture the gameplay-generated storytelling that will be unique to every run you make.\n\n\nJournal Entry for the Daily Challenge, dated October 25:\nWhat began as an omen for failure left me with an arrow head and the fangs of a bat embedded into my flesh before even reaching the second floor of the mines. I hastily bought everything I could from the short-tempered shopkeep that awaited my arrival. I searched in desparation for the pug that I had affectionately named Bread in the hopes that a kiss could boost my morale and keep me going, but to no avail. I finally reached a lush jungle filled with new and deadly obsticles. A udjat trinket that I had in my possession drew me closer to a wall covered in moss and vines. I placed my last bomb against the soil and a secret passage was revealed to me. I cautiously entered to find an illegal den of shopkeeper peddling their wares. Due to my moral compass, and perhaps because they had a lot of cool stuff I couldn't afford, I took a boomerang from one of the natives and killed every last thing that moved. Covered in blood I left the jungle, flying around with my newly acquired jetpack. In the ice caves I came across a giant blue head. An item I picked up in the jungle glowed gently. I knew that I had to die. I managed to crush myself under the weight of a falling platform, which unbeknownst to me at the time, exploded my jet pack and killed me instantly. I awoke inside the blue head and possessed a stylish new hat for my sacrifice. I felt refreshed, but devastated that I no longer possessed my jetpack. Into the temple I continued. A jackel-headed god felt the wrath of my recently acquired shotgun, and I took a shiny new trinket for my troubles. My attachment didn't last, as the trinket was a key to the fabled City of Gold. Everything around me shone brilliantly, though I couldn't lose sight of my task. I had few bombs and a tattered book of human flesh was the only treasure I sought from this place. I swiped it up to discover that the jacket-headed god had returned. Again they were no match for my shotgun. I left this place of wonder, knowing that it was only a distraction. I cautiously creeped into the next room. A cult was worshipping a statue of the great Omec. Before I could try anything the statue burst to life and crushed those around it. Before me stood the mighty Olmec. I climbed up high to safety and looked for things that might help my survival. I whipped an old crate and found just what I needed. The mightly Olmec was no match for my mattock! I dug a hole down straight down to lava. Olmec followed me, trying to crush me under its weight. But Olmec was too predictable. I stepped to the side and it fell down into the lava below. The exit was to my right. I knew that I had succeeded. But instead of leaving I jumped onto its head and rode my way to another door. The book I had acquired gnawed at my fingers in warning, but I could not be assuaged. It was hot. I knew why I gave my life to the Moai head in the ice caves. Because only the dead could descend down into hell. I had three bombs, too many ropes, and not enough health. I needed more items. I used my final bombs to kill the ancient vampire Vlad, so I could take their cape and amulet. To my surprise the shopkeepers had followed me into hell. But I suppose where else would they have gone? I could hear the booming of Yama, king of the underworld. I was so close. I would be remembered as a hero. But with Vlad's cape I wasn't able to get out of a hole I had fallen into quick enough. Two vampires dove in after me and ended my journey.\n\nJournal entry for the Daily Challenge, dated October 24:\nWhat began as a... ♥♥♥♥.

Spelunky works so well because of it's unparraleled design. No death ever feels like your fault, it is always consistant to the rules it sets and deaths are always because you weren't able to deal with the situation set in place. When you die, it really is your fault and you can feel the consiquences. However, the moments where you succeed and overcome adversity are where Spleunky really shines. Only rouge-likes can really truly offer these accomplishments, and Spelunky a great embodiment of this. Spelunky is very difficult from when you first start out, however there is a really good sense of progression even with the great randomly generated levels. When you first make it out of the mines, you feel like a king, yet you die to a tiki trap one level in to the forest. It works very well, especially when player goals are met in a single beautiful run only to have yourself die and set new goals to meet. The decision to make the presentation cartoony and vibrant really also works well to create a good juxtaposition to this difficulty and it really makes you want to keep playing. Lastly, Spelunky should be commended on it's game feel. Everything looks and feels smooth and tactile; whipping has impact, enemy deaths feel satisfying, and taking damage has a real soulcrushing effect. It all leads back to the fact that Spelunky knows how a rouge-like should be designed. It has great adveristy for the player to over come, feels fresh and rewarding, and is simply a blast to play, regardless if you are doing terrible or terrific. Overall, Spelunky is likely the best rouge-like ever made and I greatly recommend it to fans of the genre and anyone even remotely intrested in it.","November 25, 2013","true","101.6"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

The re-release, however, is not. Moving from the original game to this, the mechanics just seem -off- somehow, and they are so in a fatal way.\n\nBeing a roguelike, I expect the game to be challenging, and it is. And I expect there to be the occasional run where a bit more than skill is needed to proceed. I certainly had my fair share of deaths trying to make it to the City of Gold in the original. But after dozens of deaths due to wall-hanging unexpectedly, or shopkeepers getting aggro from environmental effects that I did not set in motion, or spike traps hitting me more than a space away, I'm going back to the original Spelunky. Shiny graphics and new features cannot make up for this.\n\nGo download the original version of the game, which is still free on the developer's website - http://spelunkyworld.com/original.html . In my humble opinion, it's a much more solid roguelike.","September 20, 2014","false","23.6"," 49 of 92 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","49","92","0","0"

That was in fact my own reaction to the game and I ended up setting it aside for months before coming back to it after seeing videos of it online.\n\nThe game is absolutely fantastic. It's hard, but you almost always fail because of something you did wrong not because of the game being unfair. It's a game that takes weeks to get good at and months & months to master (and even then), but it's very rewarding. The achievements on Steam are well designed as well and you'll get many just by progressing in the game and the last few take real skills and patience to get.\n\nAbsolutely recommended, but be patient.

The game is very skill based as well, i've been playing for a while now, and i've only made it to the Temple twice, watching more experienced players online you can tell it's much easier for them to progress, not easy by any measure, but easier certainly.\n\nI've played an awful lot of co-op as well, (local, as online/lan isn't availiable at this time) with my brother, I have to say it's a nice little addition, although harder and at times frustrating if you're seriously going for score or speed. You need to be able to communicate very well and also have the same play style to acheive anything, regardless it's a lot of fun.\n\nI have experienced some performance issues, especially at 1080p, I think by default the game is set to 720p, and I would stick to that. Any higher or if you're multitasking and there are some hefty and frequent drops in FPS, and I'm rocking a fairly beefy system i5 3570K & nVidia GTX 760.\nOther than that, it's a really, really solid game, and I would recommend it to anyone, especially at sale price, you'll definitely get your money's worth.\n\n-Stan","December 26, 2013","true","30.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This game has gained some nice physics changes, a handful of cool items to discover, enemies to kill and be killed by, local multiplayer, and even extra zones that weren't in the original game - and all of them fit seamlessly into the package. If you played the original, the new game is still well worth it.\n\nTo those of you who don't know this game, a word of warning: Spelunky is hard. It might make you shout obscenities at the screen. It might make you throw your controller in rage. It might make you consider how much happier you'd be if you just stopped. But as many times as it has frustrated me, I begrudgingly admit - the game is entirely fair. It gives you everything you need to win every time. If you fail, it is absolutely your own fault.\n\nYou'll learn, though. Every death will teach you a new lesson, or remind you of one learned before, and will inch you closer to victory.\n\nIf you enjoy a challenge, and you've grown tired of games with artificial difficulty where death is unexpected and unfair, and victory comes with abusing cheap tactics or grinding for ages or spending hours perfecting some skill, then Spelunky will be a breath of fresh air.\n\nI warn you again: It's not for the faint of heart... but for those who do enjoy the struggle, there's nothing quite like it.","April 9, 2014","true","32.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Great with friends, so long as they're patient enough to deal with you springing traps on them (and vice-versa.) Scoring is satisfying. Gameplay is super intense.

Not this one. Spelunkey has the most replay value of any single player game I own, and thats not including the multiplayer portion. There is also multiplayer which is fun as well. In the beginning it will take everything you have to survive the first level and everything will seem completely random, which it is. As you progress, however, you will realize that there are patterns in the terrain and you will be able to start predicting where things will be. The game does a good job of giving you goals that you can meet with your skill level no matter where you are in it. First you will try to make tunnels and win that way. You will think that the temple is the hardest thing you have to face but getting there is a challenge in itself. When you beat the game using shortcuts you will then want to complete it without them. Then you will try to get to the 5th stage. I won't spoil it here but you can look it up if you're interested. I frequently play spelunky while listening to a podcast because once you get the hang of it you can do most of it automatically, but its still fun, and there are still challenges.\nBottom line: get this game, you won't regret it.","May 22","true","199.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Never knew what the term meant till Spelunky. And now I totally get the appeal.\n\nSpelunky plays like a great side scrolling platformer. Maps randomly generate everytime you play through and the options to get to the end of each map are expansive. Having limited health and resources adds to the tension of the game and players have to balance the urge to speed run and resource management.\n\nThe controls are sharp. I played on both the keyboard and 360 controller and highly recommend the latter, but it's not required.\n\nThe graphics have a nice clean animation sytle to them and I love the fact I'm given the choice of whom to rescue (woman, man, dog). And while the alternate unlockable playable characters are nothing more than new skins, unlocking them all does take some effort.\n\nMy biggest complaint/recommdation: don't play this right after Super Meat Boy or any other speed runner.

The other players will quickly lose orientation and find themselves outside of the screen. This made coop a lot harder and more frustrating than singleplayer.\n\n- The game doesn't let you take your time and explore. This forces you to rush the game even more, making the bad camera even worse. Again, this counts for co-op. The time limit is managable in singleplayer.\n\nAnother thing is fairness: This game is hard. There's nothing wrong with that. But often even small mistakes are punished by instant death. An enemy might hit you once and before your character recovers hit you again, until it's game over. This can by very frustrating, but of course the challennge can also be a plus.\n\nMy reason for not recommending this is the local coop mode. If you're playing alone anyway you might as well give it a try.","December 1, 2013","false","15.8"," 228 of 444 people (51%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","51","228","444","2","13"

With your trusty damsel weapon you can block arrows, smash monsters, set off traps, and sacrifice it once every level for a new item. You must find the book of the dead then like a ninja make your way to hell and kill the SOB that took your master. Spelunky is one of the best rogue-like games out there and it's very unforgivable if you make a mistake. It's more addicting then sex and crack as you ride a shark through a flaming hoop in space; with two times more asking if your doing it right, I can't feel anything, crying, and withdrawal.  There is also a two plays mode where you and your wife can fight over whos fault was it that you both die, which later ends in divorce. Becareful not to take too long on each stage or a transgender ghost of christmas past will come and make you explode.

Hoping it would be the same thing but with updated graphics and achievements, I got it right away, but soon  found out it was an updated  port  from the 360 version. Right away I didn't like the music (each level area has a randomized track set, hit and miss) and thought some of the character animations were really awkward. I was pretty quick to dissmiss the game and had a bad taste in my mouth from what in my opinion was an over priced arcade game, but I came back to it a few days later and got hooked. I was able to look past some of the flaws I didn't care for in the game and was able to enjoy it for what it is, a brutal, unforgving yet rewarding platformer.\n\nMy only complaint about the game is the unlockable characters, I love the idea of course, but just wish they had some context, seemed like a bunch of random characters with silly outfits, I like the robot, but thats just me.","August 23, 2013","true","93.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Might be hard in the beginning, but the more you play the better you get. You might die in the first stages in your first hours of gameplay but eventually, after a lot of practicing and raging, you'll make your way to the final stage to finish of Olmec and completing the game.\n\nHowever, if you are looking for a bigger challenge than Olmec (which I am sure of you will) you can make your way to another stage after Olmec by collecting certain items during your run. After that stage, you will take on Yama. Very difficult at first, but just like the entire game: practice enough and you'll get there, no matter how hard it seems.\n\nEven after you finished of Yama, the game still has some stuff to offer.\nThe achievements are quite the challenge but really encourage you to keep playing the game.\n\nBeat the game and all achievements? Speedrunning and playing secret levels or as different characters is fun as hell (inside joke) as well.\n\nIt's the challenge that keeps you going.\n\n\nBonus: there are a lot of streamers out there on Twitch who stream Spelunky regularly which is very fun to watch as well.

The control scheme is flat out easy, making this game extremely easy to become addicted to. There are so many items to collect/use, giving awesome perks, and making gameplay that much more enjoyable. Best played with a controller. There is no unfair advantage; forcing you to become better at overcoming the odds. Random generated levels so you won't get used to the same thing over and over.

Literally - it's tough to imagine even making it out of the first set of 4 levels on first pickup of the game. It's frustrating, and, initially, left me unimpressed with the game. But, sticking through the tough first few levels and forcing yourself to be more careful, more dilligent with your movements, and taking your time to think through the level (though not too long, lest the ghost show up!) really pays off. Spelunky seems relatively harmless and shallow at first glance, but I can honestly say that this is one of the most consistently rewarding and challenging games I've ever played. And that's not even to mention the sheer complexity of the game -- at surface level it may seem that each run will turn out similarly, but that is just not the case. Rough spots in levels will kill even the most veteran players with ease, and learning how to deal with increasingly complex death traps is a key point in the game that will take a lifetime to master given the inherent randomness of each new map.\n\nIt's an incredible game you can sink some time into.

An absolute must-play!","October 14, 2014","true","64.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The trailer guides you towards the city of gold, the hardest place to get to in the game, which then leads you to the next, probably the hardest "chapter" in the whole game. Defeating the boss at the end of it is not the greatest achievement you can accomplish though... for there is a secret, insanely hard way of defeating him, probably thhe hardest in the history of gaming, and only one person on the surface of the earth did it so far, maybe you will be the next?\n\nanyway, the game has beautiful graphics and music which will absorb you for hours, and the challenges that you face will be sometimes infuriating, but overcoming them and getting better at the game is the true reward of playing this game, a sense of progression.\n\nIn conclusion this game is a 10/10 for me, and I would definitely recommend buying it to anyone who likes a "bit" of a challenge.","February 7, 2014","true","68.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It is one of few soul crushingly difficult games where your deaths come with very little frustration, and with every death you get a better understanding of the game, and the better your understanding of the game becomes, the less frustration there is to be had. And that is a huge feat given that the game is randomly generated and features perma-death. There is so much depth to the mechanics in place and so much you can do with them and the way in which they can work together to ♥♥♥♥ you over in glorious fashion is more often than not hilarious. You'll laugh at an absurd (but well deserved) death when one tiny mistake spirals off into a rube goldberg-like chain of ♥♥♥♥ery, even if you're on the brink of progressing past a point you've never reached before.\n\nThere's so many things to learn and it can be overwhelming at first, but it is so worth it. The accomplishments you'll make along the way, big or small, feel so incredibly satisfying, from just making it past the mines, to finding the black market, to killing Old Bitey, beating Olmec, unlocking the city of gold, getting to hell, successfully robbing a shop, ghost mining, speedrunning, and so much more. The skill ceiling is incredibly high, but you don't have to be a god at the game to enjoy yourself, and you're always getting better, a failed run is a new lesson learned in how to approach whatever it was that screwed you over the last time. Mastering Spelunky was one of the most rewarding experiences I've had with a game, and I can only hope to play something as good as it again.\n\nThanks to Derek Yu & Andy Hull for their amazing work.","September 5, 2013","true","278.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

With your trusty damsel weapon you can block arrows, smash monsters, set off traps, and sacrifice it once every level for a new item. You must find the book of the dead then like a ninja make your way to hell and kill the SOB that took your master. Spelunky is one of the best rogue-like games out there and it's very unforgivable if you make a mistake. It's more addicting then sex and crack as you ride a shark through a flaming hoop in space; with two times more asking if your doing it right, I can't feel anything, crying, and withdrawal.  There is also a two plays mode where you and your wife can fight over whos fault was it that you both die, which later ends in divorce.

It all comes down to pure player skill. That said, you will die a lot, and each time you die you will have to start from scratch in a new randomly generated series of maps. Because of that it never gets frustrating like other games where you might not be able to get past that one map, and you do the same ♥♥♥♥ over and over again.\nThe daily challenge is a fantastic addition too. It plays the same as every other set of levels, except the daily challenge is the same for everyone across the world, making it perfect for leaderboards. And you only get one chance: die and you have to wait till the next day for a new challenge. I fully recommend this game.\n\nAlso, there's more than just 'be touched by creature and die'. One time I threw a rock to explode a box of TNT... I hit my mark, the force of the explosion catapulted the rock back into my face. I got knocked off a ledge onto an altar to Kali and accidentally sacrificed myself. (people have to lie down on the altar for it to work so you can walk on it. But because I got knocked off my feet I lay for a second. and *POOF*) That made me lose my ♥♥♥♥ completely, I laughed so hard!\n\n10/10, would accidentally sacrifice myself to Kali again.","August 10, 2013","true","159.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It is one of few soul crushingly difficult games where your deaths come with very little frustration, and with every death you get a better understanding of the game, and the better your understanding of the game becomes, the less frustration there is to be had. And that is a huge feat given that the game is randomly generated and features perma-death. There is so much depth to the mechanics in place and so much you can do with them and the way in which they can work together to ♥♥♥♥ you over in glorious fashion is more often than not hilarious. You'll laugh at an absurd (but well deserved) death when one tiny mistake spirals off into a rube goldberg-like chain of ♥♥♥♥ery, even if you're on the brink of progressing past a point you've never reached before.\n\nThere's so many things to learn and it can be overwhelming at first, but it is so worth it. The accomplishments you'll make along the way, big or small, feel so incredibly satisfying, from just making it past the mines, to finding the black market, to killing Old Bitey, beating Olmec, unlocking the city of gold, getting to hell, successfully robbing a shop, ghost mining, speedrunning, and so much more. The skill ceiling is incredibly high, but you don't have to be a god at the game to enjoy yourself, and you're always getting better, a failed run is a new lesson learned in how to approach whatever it was that screwed you over the last time. Mastering Spelunky was one of the most rewarding experiences I've had with a game, and I can only hope to play something as good as it again.\n\nThanks to Derek Yu & Andy Hull for their amazing work.","September 5, 2013","true","278.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The cartoony, retro artstyle with iconic, clownishly bulbous noses won me over in a heartbeat when I played the original, and now that it's updated I can be smitten with it all over again.\n\nSpelunky combines the finest platforming mechanics with the high risk and deeply strategic challenge of roguelikes of yore. Back when the original game came out in 2008, its success revived the roguelike genre. That's how good this thing is.  According to the Berlin Interpretation, this game is not really a roguelike, but just between you and me, the Berlin Interpetation is a steaming load.\n\nGittan gud at Spelunky isn't nearly about learning tactics and mastering controls (although those are both very important, too) so much as it is about becoming fluent in the system. As you play the game more and become more and more intimately acquainted with its rules, you get better and better at parsing the game state at a glance so you can hack together a plan at a moment's notice. Even if you're in no immediate danger, assessing the danger you\n\nWhile the game has no "story" to speak of, the fluff -- the setting flavor, the vibe you get while playing, etc. -- is really, really good. Where do I even begin...\n\nThis game lets you BE Indiana Jones in a way that no other does. You're going into dark dungeons where you know generally what to expect, but have no idea exactly what situations you will encounter. You're unlocking the ancient secrets hidden in the cursed labyrinths, using ancient artifacts. But above all, you analyze situations and quickly formulate bold, but brilliant plans. You play your trump cards carefully... or blow them early because you're annoyed and want to make progress. This is the true brilliance of Spelunky: you ARE Indiana Jones.\n\n10/10\nwould bang\n","March 19, 2015","true","53.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Excellent gameplay formula with incredible replayability from randomized levels. Nice atmospheric music. Tight and precise control. Dynamic haiku that greets you everytime you open the game. Satisfying unlockable shortcut system. Lots of character to unlock. A well polished game that lets you develop skill and reflex overtime.\n\nThis the roguelike game that makes sense the most. Things don't try to kill you for no reason or forcing to be a roguelike without clear reasoning. There is a back-story / concept that makes it all make sense, unlike many roguelikes out there that cheaply try to kill you without clear reasoning / concept of why.","February 24, 2014","true","90.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You can play local co op, but this seems to lead to a quicker but hilarious death more often than not...\n\nThe thing I like about this game is that the world, while harsh, is fair. Some traps trigger when you get in their field of view. However, the trap triggers on enemies as well. This allows you to exploit the deadly environment to your advantage. There are items you can purchase from a mean old shopkeeper, who will yell "TERRORIST!" if you attempt robbery and will blast you to pieces with a shotgun. However, if you manage to pull off this dangerous heist, the rewards can be great. Every time you die it's because of your own damn fault, not the fault of the game itself.\n\nAnother thing I like is that when you restart the game, you restart completely. There's no meta-experience or anything like that, you're just left with only your wits. That means that only YOU, the player gets better at the game, not the in game character.. And you can get pretty damn good too (Look up on youtube).\n\nSpelunky is a crushingly difficult and masochistic Dark Souls wrapped up in a cutesy, non-offensive package that is difficult to stop playing. As soon as your character breathes his last ragged breath impaled on some spikes you're mashing the retry button to attempt another run. Just plain brilliant.","August 12, 2013","true","18.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I first picked up Spelunky Classic a year or two after it came out, and found myself thoroughly addicted for months. I was hesitant to pick up this version since I had already seen everything Classic had to offer, but Spelunky HD did not let me down. The new areas, enemies and items breathed new life into an old classic and the gameplay tweaks made it a much more polished experience.\n\nPros:\n* Detailed new graphics brimming with personality.\n* A jazzy, memorable new soundtrack. Miles better than the old one.\n* Loads of new content. The game is about 50% bigger than the original.\n* Achievements, which let veteran players push their skills to the limit.\n* Dog kissing parlors.\n\nCons:\n* The more organic physics take some getting used to.\n* Missing some features Classic had, like some Kali rewards and a playable Tunnel Man.\n* The new enemies and obstacles made an already-insane game even more difficult.\n\nOverall, I'd highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed Spelunky Classic.

You will want to play it over and over and over again. Your deaths may often seem unfair, but that fuels the desire to play again even more. Anyway, the game itself is a randomly generated platformer with treasure and monsters to find and deal with. The art style is good and the music/sounds are all fine. The goal is to get from the beginning of each room to the end of each room while getting the most treasure and not dying.\n\nPros:\nGood art\nVery challenging\nInfinite Replayability\nGood music\n\nCons:\nControls are just a tad wonky.

Spelunky is more than your traditional roguelike, and it's almost distasteful to call it that, given that the title is often used more as an excuse to explain poor gameplay balance. You will die a thousand deaths, and each time you will vow to "not make the same mistake twice" - but you probably will - but it will always be because of something you did wrong rather than dumb luck. Over time, imperceptibly at first, you will become better and better. And even when you learn to play it safe, the real rewards are tantalizingly off to the side, just waiting for you to come at them with all your skills.\n\nThe real star of this game is the random level generator which proves that randomized environments doesn't have to mean "dumb environments". Why couldn't Blizzard, with their legions of developers, come anywhere close to matching the randomized level design here? How can one man so soundly trump an entire industry of gamemakers? Each encounter is fair and beatable, each room an exercise in strategy and platforming, and even after hundreds of games, I'm still being surprised by unique challenges the randomizer comes up with.\n\nGames typically last between 1 and 30 minutes, so it is easy to just pick up a quick game here and there without getting burned out.\n\nIf you don't like jumping, and whipping snakes, and shooting giant spiders with a shotgun, and throwing damsels into pits of lava, this probably is not going to be fun for you. Though, you should know that I have judged you both silently and harshly.","January 3, 2014","true","82.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

If you wish to try the old PC version before purchasing this one, by all means: http://spelunkyworld.com/original.html\n\nAs for the updated version, a lot of good new features and items, still very difficult and still very fun. A real test of your reflexes and mechanical skill as it often pits you up against one-sided situations that must be bested before you can claim the title of having beaten this game. The difficulty is also very fair, so you get to blame yourself for every death.\n\nThe game has fifteen default levels (and a boss at the end) that must be beaten in succession, after learning the game in and out you'll be surprised to hear it's not over yet as there are another three levels (and a boss at the end!) after the "final boss". There are also five hidden levels. Oh and you must beat all of this in succession, in one single run, in one life.\n\nHas a score attack element to it too, when you eventually get good enough to consistently beat the game you can try to get the highest score, still plenty of fun and lots of challenge.\n\nIt doesn't matter how many times you die, you will want to try again and again and again to get further and further than you've ever been before!

It stays true to it's genre though, as it is VERY challenging and unforgiving. Rating is about 8/10.\n\nThe gameplay is great, but takes a good while to get used to. All dungeons are procedurally generated, meaning you're not likely to see the same place twice, ever (you'll still see similar areas often though). Some things can be very hard to do, but once you become better at them, you'll be able to progress further into the game.\n\nGraphics are nice for a 2D game, it has a lot of effects for explosions and other kind of things, and it's art style is silly in a good way.\n\nReplayability is massive, just like every other rogue-like game. You could play this game for more than 300 playthroughs before actually beating it (unless you're just very good and pay lots of attention naturally, then you'll do it in less). And maybe you could just be beating the "easy" ending. The "harder" ending takes a TON of more effort, but it's purely optional.\n\nBut frustration is a big part of this game. If you can't deal with dying for dumb reasons (that could easily be avoided but you were either desperate or didn't know what to do), then you might see yourself putting this game back on the shelter for a long while, until you feel like giving it a try again. OR if you're persistent, you'll be able to keep progressing and eventually beat the game, and well, actually progressing in this game is satisfying.\n\nTL;DR: Amazing game, very well worth the money, can induce raging if you're not patient, the kind of game that is satisfying when you see progress.","June 12, 2014","true","78.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I´d really enjoy if they would add a Co-Op mode, but it´s really amusing if you play it alone. You can play it with 4 people, if you got 4 devices.

I won't lie and say "this is the greatest game evar" because it's really not. I enjoy a good challenge, I've played all the Souls games, Super Meat boy, and Super Hexagon. I don't shy from a challenge and I love all the aforementioned games. That said, those games all have one thing this game doesn't, which is fairness. Even FTL is fair and it's also a roguelike game. No matter how much skill you have you're going to die a lot. That really seems to be the real goal of the game, kill the player as many times as possible. The shortcuts are there, but they're more detrimental to you as a player as you're now ill equipped to deal with tougher enemies. Arrow traps can literally be placed in positions that make it impossible to not take damage or die. Instant kill traps are placed everywhere and the shop keepers do not follow the same rules as the player, meaning the game is not balanced, as they move faster than you and recover from being stunned faster than you. I really, REALLY want to like this game, but I just simply cannot, because it's designed to kill the player. Also the store description is a flat out lie. You cannot explore at your own pace, as you have 2 and half minutes before an unkillable, one hit kill ghost spawns. There's also an option in the options menu for a "pro" HUD. This game was clearly geared towards speed runners and it really shows. I feel bad for supporting the devs. Mods are an unacceptable answer, as I should not have to go out of my way to download something to fix a game I paid 15 dollars for. If you don't mind beating your head against yet another selfish game in the sea of games like this, I would recommend waiting until a sale. I hate this game, but I still play it anyway, simply because I won't let my money go to waste.","June 4","false","12.8"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

And next you are lying impaled to a spike trap. Even throwing a stone at wrong place and time may cause a chain reaction which will lead to great amount of pain. So yeah.. almost every new encounter will result to either losing life or death. But little by little you gain knowledge of everything in the game and with this knowledge you will finally survive through Caves, Jungle, Ice Caves, Temple and Hell.\nOne of the features is daily challenge in which you may compete with your friends or world-wide for the highest score in the same seed(identical maps).\nGame can also be played locally with max 4 players and will usually lead to bloodshed, pain and laughter since you can't turn friendly-fire off. If your friend brutally murdered you for your bombs, don't worry. Even as a ghost you may still push your friend into a set of spikes as a revenge.\n\nSo if you love challenge, survival and permanent deaths you should buy this game. It's worth it!\nAlso remember to kill every shopkeeper. They charge way too much for their items and the game was way too easy to begin with.","June 14, 2014","true","52.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I would recommend this to anyone with a PC /xbox controller and who enjoys games like mario, castlevania, or even contra. futher, the original spelunky is free so if you aren't sure if you want to spend the money right now, go try the free original and then make a  decision.

It combines arcade platforming with devastating perma-death and randomized levels that work so well I have yet to experience a single death that I can blame on the game. Instead, there are a multitude of deaths I have to blame on myself. But after every death, the slight progress made in the next run is more than enough motivation to continue playing.\n\nFor someone that demands a story or graphics to carry them through a game, this is not a purchase to be made at full price. The graphics are simple and the story concise (albiet almost non-existant) to properly focus on the beautiful mechanics of the game. These mechanics create opportunity to continue playing the game after the first completion with different challenge runs or different paths. Instead of going through the normal levels you can travel into the stomach of a giant worm, go to a castle, or visit a black market filled with goodies for you to buy (or steal!).\n\nIn my opinion, to get the most fun out of Spelunky I recommend a controller.

One of the first things you'll notice is that the music is pretty great, but that's the least of what's to come. The gameplay is difficult but rewarding, and the random level generation combined with the interesting gameplay elements makes it worth trekking your way through the "same" few levels over and over again until you finally get good enough to make it to the Jungle. After that, you only keep getting better, and you really start to get into it. There are plenty of mechanics to discover, and every item and enemy is different from the last. Even once you beat the game, that's not the end. The phrase, "It's not about the destination, it's the journey" really applies to this game. It has crazy replay value, not to mention that there's another, much more difficult ending. Some of the replay value comes from trying to get better scores, and expanding on that, the Daily Challenge, which is all about scores as well as competing with friends. The Daily Challenge takes an already addictively replayable game and gives it what it needs to be a game you'll want to just keep on playing.","July 6, 2014","true","99.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I would however suggest that you try to the original free version of Spelunky before you play this one to get a feel of how this game works, but the graphics in this are much better and the game-play overall feels better to me.","February 2, 2014","true","18.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This one is better than all of them. It has great precision platforming, replayability forever, and difficulty that tests both knowledge and skill. You are going to die. It's going to happen often. You won't know that enemy was capable of attacking you that way. And then you'll immediately started again with important new knowledge. You can't get by the difficult platforming sections based purely on muscle memory because the layouts constantly change, you instead need to learn the game. How far you can jump from a standstill or running, how that changes with items, how far you can fall without damage, the range and time delay on your whip; you need to get the mechanics down to succeed. You'll probably start out rushing into everything and dying thirty seconds into the game, then you'll take it ridiculously slow and be terrified of everything, then you'll play at a speed somewhere between the two and amaze anybody still living in phase 2.\n\nThere's an endless amount of challenge, not only from the randomized layouts but also from hidden levels, secret items to find, and achievement-encouraged alternate ways of playing the game. There's an Achievement for finishing the game with $500,000 worth of treasure. There's also one for finishing the game with $0 worth of treasure, which is so very much harder to do than the high score. Speed runs are encouraged and also the sort of thing crazy people do.\n\nSpelunky is good. Really, really good. If you've ever liked a platformer, try Spelunky.\n\nAnd the soundtrack. That god damned soundtrack. Just buy the game so you can hear the most triumphant "WE'RE GOIN' ON AN ADVENTURE" title music of all time.","December 26, 2013","true","177.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Games involves some basic controls (dpad, A,B,X,Y and 1 trigger should be enough), also some oldschool mechanics, like the items you actively use must be carried (so no throwing rocks if you're holding a laser gun).

Being not only oddly charming and colorful, Spelunky also delivers what it promises, challenge. In my first dozen hours of gameplay, I havent even reached the second level, of the second stage. This may be my inferiority at platformers in gerneral, but I can say with ut-most confidence, Spelunky will challenge and addict even the most seasoned platformer fans. Everything in this game is so thought out, charming and overall wonderful (the music in particular really will bring back those retro platformer feels). As you go farther into the gameplay, you become more and more engrained. Now, when you die on the first level, it will begin to aggrivate you, and when that bomb you thought would land in a web bounces back and blows you to shreds one block away from your cute little miner man, you want to tear your hair out! And as you should, learning from your mistakes in Spelunky will be key to your future success, in the next level, or life.\n\nSpelunky is a rare gem (no pun intended) in the platformer genre that seems to be under appreciated and played.

The constituent parts are simple - it's a platformer with strong rogue-like elements. That is, permadeath with random levels, and as hard as nails.\n\nA good complete playthrough will take about 20 minutes, but you'll spend tens of hours perfecting your skills to get to the stage where you can actually beat the game.\n\nThe controls are perfect, the mechanics extremely well tuned, and the game never feels unfair. Every situation is navigable, every death preventable, it just depends upon your skills. And deaths are hilarious - they're usually something really stupid you've done.\n\nI once saw a streamer (Anthony Burch of HAWP fame) daze himself from falling and ended up accidentally sacrificing himself on an altar, killing himself instantly. Right near the end of the game.\n\nMy favourite part of this game is just how much the randomness affects the game strategy and gameplay in general. Random levels often feel bland and uninspired, but Spelunky manages to make the randomness really matter. You have to make meaningful decisions and hedge your bets. I could use a bomb, but, I've only got 3 left and might need to use a couple later on..\n\nAnyway, this is the cream of the crop as far as platformer roguelikes go.

You want that treasure. However, there are many foes! Bats! Spiders! Giant Spiders! Snakes! Tiki People! Frogs! And much more. Sounds simple, yes? WRONG. Olmec will be sure to break you. Want to prove him wrong? Then play this game if you dare.\n\nAlright onto the real review. The game is absolutely fantastic. You could play the game "the normal way" and honestly miss A LOT of extra things you probably didn't even know about. You carry a whip, a few bombs, and some ropes. You can acquire more from boxes, purchasing (or stealing if you're feelin' lucky) some from shop keepers or finding some underground (sometimes). As I said before there is a "normal" way to beat the game which consists of 4 stages. The game is also VERY difficult for (most) newcomers. So don't feel disouraged if you're not doing very well.\n\nThe enemies. Oh boy, are there a lot of these fu- I mean suckers. They all do more than just touch you to do damage mind you. They will leap, fly, shoot, spit, crush you, use psychic moves, charge at you, throw boomerangs, throw you, and the list could go on. Trust me. It's a lot and brutal. But for all the right reasons which adds charm to the enemies and much of a challenge.\n\nThe lovely, lovely items. There's TONS of items. Ranging from your whip and bombs to an ancient knife found in the belly of a giant worm and an incredibly dangerous high tech alien rocket launcher. There's more than just weapons too. There's items that can make you run faster, climb walls, hover, fly, see through walls, and even an eggplant!\n\nThe events...oh dear lord I'd cry inside every time I encountered one of these. So basically an event is when you enter a level and something "unusual" is happening like the room being entirely dark, the room may be ridden with giant spiders, or even an alien lord may be nearby. Each stage has it's own set of events fit for it's own stage so certain events will ONLY happen in that stage.\n\nI don't want to make this review too long (though maybe I have), but this is a must play game if you're one who enjoys a challenge.","November 4, 2015","true","42.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a dungeon crawl that i find particularly enjoyable because while many recent dungeon crawls and roguelikes (or pseudo-roguelikes) have some sort of progression with each playthrough (i.e. unlockable weapons, items, or characters with unique abilities), the only benefit from playing through Spelunky is an increase in understanding of the levels and experience to help you conquer the ever changing levels. Spelunky is among the most challenging and satisfying games I have ever played, and it keeps me wanting more.

No doubt the shenanigans can only make this game even more awesome.\n\nBut if you don't have local friends, I'd suggest checking out the dev's website. There he distributes for free an earlier version of Spelunky which is fairly much the same game. Most of the mechanics are the same between versions and the largest differences are the change in artstyle and the addition of several new types of enemy and a (few?) level(s).\n\nThat said the transition between the new and old versions isn't completely plain sailing. There are slight quibbles with both that keep them on par. For example, the shopkeepers in the old version pause when they leave the screen making them supremely exploitable, whereas in the new version they do not. Likewise in the new version arrow traps fire horizontally, which makes them far less fun and far more gotcha than the arcing arrow traps that the older version uses which will not catch you off guard if you accidentally run at them from off-screen.\n\nSo overall, if have friends, buy this great platformer, grab some controllers and have fun. If don't have friends, play the game for free until you wisk to pay the dev some money for being awesome (and increase the difficulty marginally).\n\nJust in case you're not convinced this is a great game, it's a very strong platformer, with the focus on going fast and jumping accurately so you can traverse the level and collect all the gold before it launches a heat-seeking kill ghost after you. And even that you can out platform.\n\nThe rest of the game relies on many interlocking subsystems that work brilliantly together, and it's a matter of learning what you can pull off when that determines how well you do beyond the simple jump puzzle. For example, you can jump on most enemies to defeat them. But a couple will punish you for jumping on them. But as soon as you pick up some spike boots, at least one of the enemies no longer retaliates due to the spiky death. So there's this constant game of "I have these items so these strategies are open to me" that keeps discovery fresh, and makes this game very replayable.\n\nSo 5/5. Just don't expect to win very frequently if you anger all the shopkeepers consistently (like I do).","September 11, 2013","true","79.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Aside from the short tutorial, which will introduce you to the basic controls, the game of Spelunky is yours to explore.\n\nThe game offers four main areas, with an additional bonus level. All of the areas are designed with unique challenges, and are always auto generated. Therefore, each time you play (or replay) an area, it will never resemble the previous one you just played.\n\nThe game is very difficult, as anything that can kill you, will kill you. However, the game is also rewarding to play, despite its sadistic tendencies to deprive you of your hopes and dreams. Therefore, trial and error are a significant aspect of the game and Spelunky will more than simply challenge your endurance and wits.\n\nEven though caution is advised, you cannot spend too much time loitering around as there is a 2.30 minute limit before a ghost appears that will attempt to hunt you down and kill you, ending your pitiful life and throwing you back to ground zero.\n\nA worthwhile indie game, 10/10.","April 20, 2014","true","6.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a 2d platformer where you journey deep to get mad cash, to get there, though, you'll go through randomly generated levels with initially cruel difficulty. First off it's fun as to play because the controls are spot on. people have said super meat boy was spot on but it was loose as hell but this game has perfect controls. some nerds might say it seems clunky at the start but after just a bit of playtime it works perfectly. Of course it kinda requires a controller to have bearable controls but it's a platformer so that's kinda expected.\n\nThe levels in general are fun because they're extremely challenging to a new player. Most of them have you go through fast (as there is a limited time before you're at extreme risk), but you also have to watch out for traps as this is a tomb-themed game. The level settings are cool too, and for convenience they include ♥♥♥♥ like shortcuts. Of course the shortcuts which take you to later levels don't count for scores, and can't be used in things like the daily challenge, but it's great that they put it in as you a. might want to not play a full game and b. might want to see all the content earlier.\n\nBuy it it's fun asf.","January 27, 2014","true","13.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Spelunky is... you know how carnival amusements and claw machines are literally programmed to make sure you don't win?  Like f'rinstance, the claw only closes one in every 1,000 plays?  Spelunky feels a lot like that.  You play, hoping the levels give you what you need to win - knowing that, FAR more often than not, you are going to die in a few minutes/seconds.\n\nYou know the game is going to pull cheap moves on you - like giving you the jet pack, the shotgun, all the tools you need to find the secrets of the game... and then springing a dark level full of giant spiders and spikes.  This game is brimming with one-hit kills.  This game is overflowing with cheap deaths.  This game is absolutely teeming with a litany of gurgling curses, choked-out between spittle-spraying clenched teeth uttered by the players over the last few years; getting rocked by the spikes after a monkey jumped on their back, bounced(unconscious) into a caveman who threw them 40 feet in some kind of Rube Goldbergian, assisted-suicide Kevorkian machine tends to breed a depth of crude language that we spent eons evolving *out* of - I have learned swear words I did not know were in my own vocabulary.  The whip is too slow, you can hurt yourself by tossing a rock 2 feet into the air and having it crush your skull, and arrow traps haunt my nightmares.\n\nSo why do I play?\n\nVENGEANCE.  I play this game out of the pure engine of hatred that it has built within me, solely to crush the dungeons and see those smarmy shopkeepers blasted by their own shotguns.\n\n10/10, would hate self again.","August 10, 2015","true","66.2"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

You’ll die a lot in this game and to continue any further, you’ll have to learn about your mistakes.\n\nYou have to be very patient and careful  while playing Spelunky, rushing through the levels will get you killed immediately.  Any mistake will punish you here.   So I wouldn’t recommend this game to impatient people or people that don’t like the  “trial and error”  mechanic.\nThe game’s hard but not frustrating   (In my opinion, dying in this game makes you want to play more) , there’s  a lot of content and variety  (items, enemies, levels, etc), the visuals are unique and even if the game’s 2D, it really dives you into it.\nI love the concept of the  Journal:  it’s a book with all the information of the game (places, enemies, items…) that you fill up once you interacted with it for the first time. For instance, you forgot what an item does you can check what it does. But I think I like the drawings, yeah… I like the drawings more.\n\nMy complaints would be that   it takes some time to get used to the controls.\nEven though it’s about learning from your mistakes, sometimes obstacles are almost impossible to avoid leading to  cheap deaths   (trust me, there’s a lot of BS).\nIt’s a shame  there’s a lot of characters but they’re just skins,  it would have been cool if they started with different starting items/ abilities.\n\nStill a very addicting game where you rescue  pugs.

It’s Roguelike in that all of the levels, terrain and enemies in the game are randomly generated, which helps keep the game fresh and interesting. It reminded me quite a bit of Rogue Legacy with its excellent design and brutal difficulty.\n\nThe object of each level in Spelunky is to get to the exit, but you’ll have to navigate through lots of traps and other enemies in a randomly generated level. Your character will start with a limited supply of bombs and ropes to help you navigate the level. Bombs can be used to destroy terrain and dig deeper while ropes can be used to help you climb back up. You don’t always want to just race to the exit when you find it either, you’ll want to explore the level and gather as much gold and upgrades as you can find before leaving. But if you spend too long in any given level, a giant ghost that can kill you instantly appears to chase you out of the level. There’s also a maiden hidden in each level. If you bring her to the exit, she will restore one point of your health, so you’ll want to try to find and rescue her in each level. You’ll find shops hidden in each level where you can spend your gold to replenish your bombs/ropes, and buy weapons and upgrades. Spelunky also features local co-op which is pretty fun, but still just as hard.\n\nIt’s a very difficult game, but if you don’t get frustrated it’s a very addictive game as well. I’ve actually yet to make it past the third level in this game, but I’ve gotten close a few times. Check it out if you enjoy difficult platformers\n\nFor more game reviews, check out http://whatisjamesplaying.blogspot.com/","January 24, 2014","true","91.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is a hugely challenging and entertaining game that will have you hooked for days – if not weeks.

You will have to improve your skills by learning the environments and enemies – and hope for some luck along the way.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/soundofsilver/recommended/239350/","soundofsilver","sound of silver","http://steamcommunity.com/id/soundofsilver/","76 products in account","Spelunky is a cave-exploration, treasure-gathering roguelike platformer, where you take the role of an Indiana Jones-type explorer.  Levels are dynamically generated each time you play, and when you die, you must start from the beginning of the game.  The goal is essentially to make it to the end of the game (or at least, as far as you can go!) without dying and while gathering as much treasure as possible.  The game also reminded me a lot of Dark Souls, one of my favourite games, in that is hard.  You will die often, probably in the first level, and there is little room for error.\n\nThis is a lot more fun that it might sound.   Spelunky is a deceptively simple, challenging, and deep action-adventure platformer and one of the best games I’ve ever played.\n\nBasically, you enter a new level, and must make your way to the exit at bottom of the mineshaft or ancient temple.  Along the way, you can gather treasure, rescue “damsels” by carrying them with you to the exit, or even plunder sacred idols and avoid massive boulder traps.  Levels become progressively more difficult – you must avoid snakes, spiders, skeletons, deadly traps, spikes, and bottomless pits, to name only a few, all while trying to collect treasure and helpful items.  Tools at your disposal include your trusty whip, ropes, bombs and a multitude of other interesting powerups and weapons.  If you’re lucky you can even find a jetpack!\n\nThe controls are incredibly precise and responsive.  You can jump, walk, sprint, pick up items and throw items, or even use items that you can carry with you.  The game would be incredibly frustrating if you were ever fighting the controls, as the game leaves no room for error.  But, it gives the player perfect control and you will never blame the controls for an untimely death.  If you’ve ever played Super Meat Boy, you’ll have an idea of what makes these controls so great: they’re fast, responsive, precise, and intuitive.  Additionally, the game has superb hitboxes, and you’ll never feel like you got killed unfairly by something that shouldn’t have hit you.\n\nEach level in Spelunky is procedurally generated and is different every time you play.  The levels themselves are completely destructible – you can use bombs to blast a path directly to the exit, or else use a pickaxe to mine some rare gems.   There are also a number of different environments, including an underground jungle and an alien-filled ice cave, which keep things fresh and keep you motivated to push forward.  The game is therefore never about memorization – you can’t memorize the jumps or traps or enemy patterns.  The focus is always on mastering the gameplay, and mastering the intricate interlocking gameplay systems.\n\nAs mentioned, death in Spelunky comes fast and frequently.  You start a game with four hearts, which you can replenish by rescuing damsels.  However, any number of things can kill you instantly or take a big chunk of your health – falling on spikes, or getting caught by an arrow trap, or even blasting a wall and getting caught by the resulting debris.  Spelunky is all about learning from each run and each death, and applying that to your next run – whether you learn that you can throw a bomb into cobwebs to blast the giant spider lying in wait, or you learn not to carelessly throw rocks which can land back on your head.  Frequent death never bogs the game down – you can quickly jump right back into the game when you die, without any lengthy loading screens.\n\nSpelunky for Steam has detailed, clean graphics reminiscent of a Super Nintendo game.  The environments, characters and enemies are full of personality and are well animated.  The cutesy appearance, however, belies some of the brutal deaths your character will experience, whether that means getting shredded by a shotgun, or impaled by spikes, or incinerated by a bomb.  This mismatch between the surface appearance and the harsh difficulty and violent deaths lends the game a lot of humour.  Likewise, the audio is varied and well-done, and fits the visuals perfectly.\n\nOne of my favourite things about Splunky is the number of hidden secrets.  There are hidden levels, secret items, and so many interesting ways to use even the most mundane tools.  The game even includes a completely hidden final dungeon and a “true” final boss, which most players will probably never experience or even discover!\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend Spelunky to fans of platformers, and anyone who enjoys challenging, well-designed games.  There is so much replayability, and so much room to master its deep and rewarding gameplay.  Spelunky is a joy to experience, and one of the best games I’ve ever played.","April 12, 2014","true","23.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Being not only oddly charming and colorful, Spelunky also delivers what it promises, challenge. In my first dozen hours of gameplay, I havent even reached the second level, of the second stage. This may be my inferiority at platformers in gerneral, but I can say with ut-most confidence, Spelunky will challenge and addict even the most seasoned platformer fans. Everything in this game is so thought out, charming and overall wonderful (the music in particular really will bring back those retro platformer feels). As you go farther into the gameplay, you become more and more engrained. Now, when you die on the first level, it will begin to aggrivate you, and when that bomb you thought would land in a web bounces back and blows you to shreds one block away from your cute little miner man, you want to tear your hair out! And as you should, learning from your mistakes in Spelunky will be key to your future success, in the next level, or life.\n\nSpelunky is a rare gem (no pun intended) in the platformer genre that seems to be under appreciated and played. Chanses are, since you landed here, you are looking for your next rogelike adventure, or a new challenge to dump many hours into. Don't miss your chance, THIS IS what you have been searching for, and trust me, you won't be able to get enough of it. If you have the money, or the timing to find this genuinly fun platformer on sale, I would highly recomend the purchase.","August 23, 2014","true","62.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The gameplay is fluid, the visuals are appreciable, and the music has a mysterious, enticing vibe.\n\nAlthough difficult and often frustrating, Spelunky is a great joy to experience, and will always have you clicking that retry button. The game offers a local Co-Op option, where up to 4 players can work together (or hilariously kill one another). If the main gameplay is becoming stale, there are mini-games available, such as one with the sole goal of killing other competitors.\n\nEveryday, players can compete against others in daily challenges. The Daily Challenge is a game mode where all players explore the same generated map, with the goal of achieving the highest possible score.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that, although the PC controls aren't terrible, the game is best played with an Xbox controller. Demanding hours upon hours of gameplay, Spelunky is an absolute must buy for rogue-likish enthusiasts, as well as players looking for an enjoyable experience, all for a reasonable price of $15 at full price.","July 18, 2014","true","17.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

One of the first things you'll notice is that the music is pretty great, but that's the least of what's to come. The gameplay is difficult but rewarding, and the random level generation combined with the interesting gameplay elements makes it worth trekking your way through the "same" few levels over and over again until you finally get good enough to make it to the Jungle. After that, you only keep getting better, and you really start to get into it. There are plenty of mechanics to discover, and every item and enemy is different from the last. Even once you beat the game, that's not the end. The phrase, "It's not about the destination, it's the journey" really applies to this game. It has crazy replay value, not to mention that there's another, much more difficult ending. Some of the replay value comes from trying to get better scores, and expanding on that, the Daily Challenge, which is all about scores as well as competing with friends. The Daily Challenge takes an already addictively replayable game and gives it what it needs to be a game you'll want to just keep on playing.","July 6, 2014","true","99.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The Daily Challenge provides a fun little experience where every player gets the same seed and you go for the highest score.\nThe game is difficult though. I won't lie. Dying on a Daily by a stupid mistake or a jump that didn't go to plan does make you want to scratch out your eyes. If you like to go for achievements and stuff, good luck. Collecting no treasure on a run or completing the game in under 8 minutes will test you like never before. There are even a bunch of cool mods that have been made for this game.\n\nAll in all, I love everything about Spelunky.

It's difficult and it's meant to be difficult.  When you first start, you will die A LOT. Even when you're "good" at the game, you'll die a lot.  It's like an oldschool NES game.  They pull no punches with the difficulty.  It's a difficult game, but it's fair.  96% of the time, when you die or take damage, it was your fault.  You just weren't careful enough, fast enough, or didn't think things through.  It's a rougelike game with random levels.  Even if you really suck at the game, you will find yourself slowly getting better.  It's a progression.  Also, there will be times when you will get really mad at the game.  If you have a bad temper and tend to destroy things when you're angry, do not buy this game!  Sometimes, you'll need to cool off after a frustrating death.  You start with 4 hit points, it's tough to gain more, and there's lots of stuff that can instakill you as well.  There's also a time limit of 2 min, 30 seconds per level.  It shouldn't take you nearly that long to complete each level, but if you fart around, there are consequences!  You don't insta die but an invulnerable ghost of doom will slowly start to float after you.   That being said, it's a fun game.   It takes your full concentration to play the game.  I died 742 times before I beat it on life 743.  Beating it is tough, but possible.  You have to be good and lucky.  After you beat it, there's an insanely difficult secret ending as well!  The music is good and the game is a really fun platformer overall.  There's also a humor factor, dying in ridiculous ways can be hilarious. Even after beating it, I still enjoy playing it.\nRecommended to those who are patient, love platfomers, love a challenge, and who won't break their monitor after dying on a really good run!","January 21, 2014","true","36.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I think game developers would do well to look to it as an example of an already good game that has been polished well. I've played a lot of the original freeware version, mods like Tastes Like Spelunky and now the remake. My friend gifted me this on steam as the GOG version doesn't have daily challenges and given how much I go on about Spelunky he thought I was missing out.\n\nI would wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone. The extra content added is great and the changes and fixes are welcomed. No longer will I accidently kill damsels with sticky bombs!

It combines arcade platforming with devastating perma-death and randomized levels that work so well I have yet to experience a single death that I can blame on the game. Instead, there are a multitude of deaths I have to blame on myself. But after every death, the slight progress made in the next run is more than enough motivation to continue playing.\n\nFor someone that demands a story or graphics to carry them through a game, this is not a purchase to be made at full price. The graphics are simple and the story concise (albiet almost non-existant) to properly focus on the beautiful mechanics of the game. These mechanics create opportunity to continue playing the game after the first completion with different challenge runs or different paths. Instead of going through the normal levels you can travel into the stomach of a giant worm, go to a castle, or visit a black market filled with goodies for you to buy (or steal!).\n\nIn my opinion, to get the most fun out of Spelunky I recommend a controller. A keyboard will do the job, but it doesn't feel nearly as fluid to me.","November 26, 2013","true","23.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

We watch a little TV while we eat dinner, then we play Spelunky.  It's just someting that's part of our daily routine.\n\nI absolutely adore this game now, both for the challenge it presents and for the time I get to spend with my favorite person.\n\nAs far as gameplay goes, it's frustratingly difficult and you will rage quit often.  However, the controls are tight and ultra precise and very rarely do you feel you lost because the game cheated you.  You can almost always find where you made a mistake and that was what resulted in your untimely death.\n\nFor difficulty, it took us around 100 hours to beat the first, normal boss.  For the secret, hidden, true boss it took near 170 hours!  That's a huge amount of bang for your buck!\n\nI highly recommend this game for anyone looking for a great 2D platformer that doesn't pull any punches.","August 21, 2014","true","514.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a roguelike, but with that same sense of progression you get from similar games like "Rogue Legacy." The best part is that every death is fair: you rarely get thrown into a situation that you can't survive, but a moment's indecision or impatience will kill you quickly. So much to discover and find: I've only scratched the surface after 9 hours and can't wait to start another match to see what the game randomly throws my way next.

Its a great rougelike game (permadeath). it is a platformer similar to splunker for the NES (throw back*) and is just fun. as you play more you delve deeper into your own tomb finding  bats snakes, mummies, and even aliens among all other sorts of stuff. Speunky has a Indana Jones flair too. I would recommend this to anyone with a PC /xbox controller and who enjoys games like mario, castlevania, or even contra. futher, the original spelunky is free so if you aren't sure if you want to spend the money right now, go try the free original and then make a  decision. Its a real gem in the FPS land that we live in. and if you have friends, you can ahve 4 player co-op!\n\nbasically, you jump and kill things but if you die its over.

It's difficult and it's meant to be difficult.  When you first start, you will die A LOT. Even when you're "good" at the game, you'll die a lot.  It's like an oldschool NES game.  They pull no punches with the difficulty.  It's a difficult game, but it's fair.  96% of the time, when you die or take damage, it was your fault.  You just weren't careful enough, fast enough, or didn't think things through.  It's a rougelike game with random levels.  Even if you really suck at the game, you will find yourself slowly getting better.  It's a progression.  Also, there will be times when you will get really mad at the game.  If you have a bad temper and tend to destroy things when you're angry, do not buy this game!  Sometimes, you'll need to cool off after a frustrating death.  You start with 4 hit points, it's tough to gain more, and there's lots of stuff that can instakill you as well.  There's also a time limit of 2 min, 30 seconds per level.  It shouldn't take you nearly that long to complete each level, but if you fart around, there are consequences!  You don't insta die but an invulnerable ghost of doom will slowly start to float after you.   That being said, it's a fun game.   It takes your full concentration to play the game.  I died 742 times before I beat it on life 743.  Beating it is tough, but possible.  You have to be good and lucky.  After you beat it, there's an insanely difficult secret ending as well!  The music is good and the game is a really fun platformer overall.  There's also a humor factor, dying in ridiculous ways can be hilarious. Even after beating it, I still enjoy playing it.\nRecommended to those who are patient, love platfomers, love a challenge, and who won't break their monitor after dying on a really good run!","January 21, 2014","true","36.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It’s Roguelike in that all of the levels, terrain and enemies in the game are randomly generated, which helps keep the game fresh and interesting. It reminded me quite a bit of Rogue Legacy with its excellent design and brutal difficulty.\n\nThe object of each level in Spelunky is to get to the exit, but you’ll have to navigate through lots of traps and other enemies in a randomly generated level. Your character will start with a limited supply of bombs and ropes to help you navigate the level. Bombs can be used to destroy terrain and dig deeper while ropes can be used to help you climb back up. You don’t always want to just race to the exit when you find it either, you’ll want to explore the level and gather as much gold and upgrades as you can find before leaving. But if you spend too long in any given level, a giant ghost that can kill you instantly appears to chase you out of the level. There’s also a maiden hidden in each level. If you bring her to the exit, she will restore one point of your health, so you’ll want to try to find and rescue her in each level. You’ll find shops hidden in each level where you can spend your gold to replenish your bombs/ropes, and buy weapons and upgrades. Spelunky also features local co-op which is pretty fun, but still just as hard.\n\nIt’s a very difficult game, but if you don’t get frustrated it’s a very addictive game as well. I’ve actually yet to make it past the third level in this game, but I’ve gotten close a few times. Check it out if you enjoy difficult platformers\n\nFor more game reviews, check out http://whatisjamesplaying.blogspot.com/","January 24, 2014","true","91.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You’ll die a lot in this game and to continue any further, you’ll have to learn about your mistakes.\n\nYou have to be very patient and careful  while playing Spelunky, rushing through the levels will get you killed immediately.  Any mistake will punish you here.   So I wouldn’t recommend this game to impatient people or people that don’t like the  “trial and error”  mechanic.\nThe game’s hard but not frustrating   (In my opinion, dying in this game makes you want to play more) , there’s  a lot of content and variety  (items, enemies, levels, etc), the visuals are unique and even if the game’s 2D, it really dives you into it.\nI love the concept of the  Journal:  it’s a book with all the information of the game (places, enemies, items…) that you fill up once you interacted with it for the first time. For instance, you forgot what an item does you can check what it does. But I think I like the drawings, yeah… I like the drawings more.\n\nMy complaints would be that   it takes some time to get used to the controls.\nEven though it’s about learning from your mistakes, sometimes obstacles are almost impossible to avoid leading to  cheap deaths   (trust me, there’s a lot of BS).\nIt’s a shame  there’s a lot of characters but they’re just skins,  it would have been cool if they started with different starting items/ abilities.\n\nStill a very addicting game where you rescue  pugs.  Yup,  pugs & drawings  are my jam.","July 1, 2015","true","48.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Spelunky is an aquired taste however, it is by no means easy, and the frustration involved in dying tops that of which I experience playing the binding of isaac. I think the best thing about Spelunky is its quirky charm, a neat little indie game with lots of imperfections, but these imperfections make the game interesting and unique, the best quality in all indie games. The enemies are fairly standard and the music is good but not astounding, but I think the aesthtics make it really stand out from other games. The design of the levels have been thought out carefully (side note: if you wish to learn the unique way the game was made, watch indie game the movie's special edition features) and I think how the surroundings change as you progress keeps what you're seeing interesting. 9/10, great game but it could have a better soundtack in my opinion.

It combines arcade platforming with devastating perma-death and randomized levels that work so well I have yet to experience a single death that I can blame on the game. Instead, there are a multitude of deaths I have to blame on myself. But after every death, the slight progress made in the next run is more than enough motivation to continue playing.\n\nFor someone that demands a story or graphics to carry them through a game, this is not a purchase to be made at full price. The graphics are simple and the story concise (albiet almost non-existant) to properly focus on the beautiful mechanics of the game. These mechanics create opportunity to continue playing the game after the first completion with different challenge runs or different paths. Instead of going through the normal levels you can travel into the stomach of a giant worm, go to a castle, or visit a black market filled with goodies for you to buy (or steal!).\n\nIn my opinion, to get the most fun out of Spelunky I recommend a controller. A keyboard will do the job, but it doesn't feel nearly as fluid to me.","November 26, 2013","true","23.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

No doubt the shenanigans can only make this game even more awesome.\n\nBut if you don't have local friends, I'd suggest checking out the dev's website. There he distributes for free an earlier version of Spelunky which is fairly much the same game. Most of the mechanics are the same between versions and the largest differences are the change in artstyle and the addition of several new types of enemy and a (few?) level(s).\n\nThat said the transition between the new and old versions isn't completely plain sailing. There are slight quibbles with both that keep them on par. For example, the shopkeepers in the old version pause when they leave the screen making them supremely exploitable, whereas in the new version they do not. Likewise in the new version arrow traps fire horizontally, which makes them far less fun and far more gotcha than the arcing arrow traps that the older version uses which will not catch you off guard if you accidentally run at them from off-screen.\n\nSo overall, if have friends, buy this great platformer, grab some controllers and have fun. If don't have friends, play the game for free until you wisk to pay the dev some money for being awesome (and increase the difficulty marginally).\n\nJust in case you're not convinced this is a great game, it's a very strong platformer, with the focus on going fast and jumping accurately so you can traverse the level and collect all the gold before it launches a heat-seeking kill ghost after you. And even that you can out platform.\n\nThe rest of the game relies on many interlocking subsystems that work brilliantly together, and it's a matter of learning what you can pull off when that determines how well you do beyond the simple jump puzzle. For example, you can jump on most enemies to defeat them. But a couple will punish you for jumping on them. But as soon as you pick up some spike boots, at least one of the enemies no longer retaliates due to the spiky death. So there's this constant game of "I have these items so these strategies are open to me" that keeps discovery fresh, and makes this game very replayable.\n\nSo 5/5. Just don't expect to win very frequently if you anger all the shopkeepers consistently (like I do).","September 11, 2013","true","79.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It’s Roguelike in that all of the levels, terrain and enemies in the game are randomly generated, which helps keep the game fresh and interesting. It reminded me quite a bit of Rogue Legacy with its excellent design and brutal difficulty.\n\nThe object of each level in Spelunky is to get to the exit, but you’ll have to navigate through lots of traps and other enemies in a randomly generated level. Your character will start with a limited supply of bombs and ropes to help you navigate the level. Bombs can be used to destroy terrain and dig deeper while ropes can be used to help you climb back up. You don’t always want to just race to the exit when you find it either, you’ll want to explore the level and gather as much gold and upgrades as you can find before leaving. But if you spend too long in any given level, a giant ghost that can kill you instantly appears to chase you out of the level. There’s also a maiden hidden in each level. If you bring her to the exit, she will restore one point of your health, so you’ll want to try to find and rescue her in each level. You’ll find shops hidden in each level where you can spend your gold to replenish your bombs/ropes, and buy weapons and upgrades. Spelunky also features local co-op which is pretty fun, but still just as hard.\n\nIt’s a very difficult game, but if you don’t get frustrated it’s a very addictive game as well. I’ve actually yet to make it past the third level in this game, but I’ve gotten close a few times. Check it out if you enjoy difficult platformers\n\nFor more game reviews, check out http://whatisjamesplaying.blogspot.com/","January 24, 2014","true","91.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Spelunky is... you know how carnival amusements and claw machines are literally programmed to make sure you don't win?  Like f'rinstance, the claw only closes one in every 1,000 plays?  Spelunky feels a lot like that.  You play, hoping the levels give you what you need to win - knowing that, FAR more often than not, you are going to die in a few minutes/seconds.\n\nYou know the game is going to pull cheap moves on you - like giving you the jet pack, the shotgun, all the tools you need to find the secrets of the game... and then springing a dark level full of giant spiders and spikes.  This game is brimming with one-hit kills.  This game is overflowing with cheap deaths.  This game is absolutely teeming with a litany of gurgling curses, choked-out between spittle-spraying clenched teeth uttered by the players over the last few years; getting rocked by the spikes after a monkey jumped on their back, bounced(unconscious) into a caveman who threw them 40 feet in some kind of Rube Goldbergian, assisted-suicide Kevorkian machine tends to breed a depth of crude language that we spent eons evolving *out* of - I have learned swear words I did not know were in my own vocabulary.  The whip is too slow, you can hurt yourself by tossing a rock 2 feet into the air and having it crush your skull, and arrow traps haunt my nightmares.\n\nSo why do I play?\n\nVENGEANCE.

No doubt the shenanigans can only make this game even more awesome.\n\nBut if you don't have local friends, I'd suggest checking out the dev's website. There he distributes for free an earlier version of Spelunky which is fairly much the same game. Most of the mechanics are the same between versions and the largest differences are the change in artstyle and the addition of several new types of enemy and a (few?) level(s).\n\nThat said the transition between the new and old versions isn't completely plain sailing. There are slight quibbles with both that keep them on par. For example, the shopkeepers in the old version pause when they leave the screen making them supremely exploitable, whereas in the new version they do not. Likewise in the new version arrow traps fire horizontally, which makes them far less fun and far more gotcha than the arcing arrow traps that the older version uses which will not catch you off guard if you accidentally run at them from off-screen.\n\nSo overall, if have friends, buy this great platformer, grab some controllers and have fun. If don't have friends, play the game for free until you wisk to pay the dev some money for being awesome (and increase the difficulty marginally).\n\nJust in case you're not convinced this is a great game, it's a very strong platformer, with the focus on going fast and jumping accurately so you can traverse the level and collect all the gold before it launches a heat-seeking kill ghost after you. And even that you can out platform.\n\nThe rest of the game relies on many interlocking subsystems that work brilliantly together, and it's a matter of learning what you can pull off when that determines how well you do beyond the simple jump puzzle. For example, you can jump on most enemies to defeat them. But a couple will punish you for jumping on them. But as soon as you pick up some spike boots, at least one of the enemies no longer retaliates due to the spiky death. So there's this constant game of "I have these items so these strategies are open to me" that keeps discovery fresh, and makes this game very replayable.\n\nSo 5/5. Just don't expect to win very frequently if you anger all the shopkeepers consistently (like I do).","September 11, 2013","true","79.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Spelunky is... you know how carnival amusements and claw machines are literally programmed to make sure you don't win?  Like f'rinstance, the claw only closes one in every 1,000 plays?  Spelunky feels a lot like that.  You play, hoping the levels give you what you need to win - knowing that, FAR more often than not, you are going to die in a few minutes/seconds.\n\nYou know the game is going to pull cheap moves on you - like giving you the jet pack, the shotgun, all the tools you need to find the secrets of the game... and then springing a dark level full of giant spiders and spikes.  This game is brimming with one-hit kills.  This game is overflowing with cheap deaths.  This game is absolutely teeming with a litany of gurgling curses, choked-out between spittle-spraying clenched teeth uttered by the players over the last few years; getting rocked by the spikes after a monkey jumped on their back, bounced(unconscious) into a caveman who threw them 40 feet in some kind of Rube Goldbergian, assisted-suicide Kevorkian machine tends to breed a depth of crude language that we spent eons evolving *out* of - I have learned swear words I did not know were in my own vocabulary.  The whip is too slow, you can hurt yourself by tossing a rock 2 feet into the air and having it crush your skull, and arrow traps haunt my nightmares.\n\nSo why do I play?\n\nVENGEANCE.  I play this game out of the pure engine of hatred that it has built within me, solely to crush the dungeons and see those smarmy shopkeepers blasted by their own shotguns.\n\n10/10, would hate self again.","August 10, 2015","true","66.2"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

You want that treasure. However, there are many foes! Bats! Spiders! Giant Spiders! Snakes! Tiki People! Frogs! And much more. Sounds simple, yes? WRONG. Olmec will be sure to break you. Want to prove him wrong? Then play this game if you dare.\n\nAlright onto the real review. The game is absolutely fantastic. You could play the game "the normal way" and honestly miss A LOT of extra things you probably didn't even know about. You carry a whip, a few bombs, and some ropes. You can acquire more from boxes, purchasing (or stealing if you're feelin' lucky) some from shop keepers or finding some underground (sometimes). As I said before there is a "normal" way to beat the game which consists of 4 stages. The game is also VERY difficult for (most) newcomers. So don't feel disouraged if you're not doing very well.\n\nThe enemies. Oh boy, are there a lot of these fu- I mean suckers. They all do more than just touch you to do damage mind you. They will leap, fly, shoot, spit, crush you, use psychic moves, charge at you, throw boomerangs, throw you, and the list could go on. Trust me. It's a lot and brutal. But for all the right reasons which adds charm to the enemies and much of a challenge.\n\nThe lovely, lovely items. There's TONS of items. Ranging from your whip and bombs to an ancient knife found in the belly of a giant worm and an incredibly dangerous high tech alien rocket launcher. There's more than just weapons too. There's items that can make you run faster, climb walls, hover, fly, see through walls, and even an eggplant!\n\nThe events...oh dear lord I'd cry inside every time I encountered one of these. So basically an event is when you enter a level and something "unusual" is happening like the room being entirely dark, the room may be ridden with giant spiders, or even an alien lord may be nearby. Each stage has it's own set of events fit for it's own stage so certain events will ONLY happen in that stage.\n\nI don't want to make this review too long (though maybe I have), but this is a must play game if you're one who enjoys a challenge.","November 4, 2015","true","42.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It solves very well many of the troubles that are present in traditional platformers, while conserving the fast pace of gameplay and adding more interesting decisions. Because of its random generation, the game will never force you or even give you the option to replay levels that you have already played, meaning that it is a new and fresh experience each time, and it actually tests your ability to platform rather than how well you have memorized its levels. The controls are very tight, and the random generation is one of the most fair that I have ever seen; rarely will you get a level that is significantly more or less difficult than average. Also notable is that the average run length is very very low, maybe 1-5 minutes for a new player, since you will be dying a lot. A successful run (don't expect this at first) will take close to 20.\n\nThe game does have its flaws: personally I find the game significantly more difficult when playing with keyboard controls, and because the character jumps very low to the ground but runs very fast it plays significantly different from most platformers (you'll get used to this, don't worry). By far the biggest flaw is its difficulty curve. The first several runs where you make it to a new area will basically be "oh, that kills you?" and you unexpectedly and hilariously die. At the end of the difficulty curve comes the endgame of score running and speed running and challenge running and things... I did these things because there were acheivements for them (like 200 hours into the game btw), and while I definitely enjoyed getting those acheivements, if you're actually trying to top (any of the) leaderboards or do some of the most difficult challenge runs (eggplant run) the game basically comes down to reseting for a good seed and taking every risk. But that's all strictly optional, and at least for me the option came after a few hundred hours of enjoyment.\n\nThough I've thought a lot about the game's flaws, I love it. I spend a lot of time replaying the game and keeping my skills sharp, even if I'm focussing on some other game at the time. I strongly recommend this game.","January 2","true","314.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is arguably my favourite games, where it an leave you in tears, or celebrating because you did an 'amazing' trick of whip an arrow out of the air. This game makes you, as another review put it, a 'Spelunky Machine' where you play out the game in your head, evaluating risk, reward and ability of a task before you do it. Obviously, anyone who's played the game will vouch for how OP the blue frogs are, and how the crush blocks will **** you into nothing when you were that close to reaching hell. In short, buy the freakin' game and complain about it for yourself.","August 2, 2015","true","135.6"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

It solves very well many of the troubles that are present in traditional platformers, while conserving the fast pace of gameplay and adding more interesting decisions. Because of its random generation, the game will never force you or even give you the option to replay levels that you have already played, meaning that it is a new and fresh experience each time, and it actually tests your ability to platform rather than how well you have memorized its levels. The controls are very tight, and the random generation is one of the most fair that I have ever seen; rarely will you get a level that is significantly more or less difficult than average. Also notable is that the average run length is very very low, maybe 1-5 minutes for a new player, since you will be dying a lot. A successful run (don't expect this at first) will take close to 20.\n\nThe game does have its flaws: personally I find the game significantly more difficult when playing with keyboard controls, and because the character jumps very low to the ground but runs very fast it plays significantly different from most platformers (you'll get used to this, don't worry). By far the biggest flaw is its difficulty curve. The first several runs where you make it to a new area will basically be "oh, that kills you?" and you unexpectedly and hilariously die. At the end of the difficulty curve comes the endgame of score running and speed running and challenge running and things... I did these things because there were acheivements for them (like 200 hours into the game btw), and while I definitely enjoyed getting those acheivements, if you're actually trying to top (any of the) leaderboards or do some of the most difficult challenge runs (eggplant run) the game basically comes down to reseting for a good seed and taking every risk. But that's all strictly optional, and at least for me the option came after a few hundred hours of enjoyment.\n\nThough I've thought a lot about the game's flaws, I love it. I spend a lot of time replaying the game and keeping my skills sharp, even if I'm focussing on some other game at the time. I strongly recommend this game.","January 2","true","314.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I’ve been dancing around saying that for the last seven years of writing about its different forms, but I feel confident about it now. It’s funny when you die from a rock flung by a bounce pad, or because a friend climbed over a ledge and accidentally dropped a knife on your head. It’s exciting when you discover a jetpack buried in the rock at an easily accessible spot. It makes you feel clever when you wield your few remaining resources towards reaching the City of Gold. It is brilliantly designed and I know game designers who credit it with inspiring their careers. And it’s £2.74.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/loveandpeace/recommended/239350/","loveandpeace","sigh of dog","http://steamcommunity.com/id/loveandpeace/","809 products in account","Do you like hard retro games?\nNo, I mean harder than Mario and Sonic and all that.\nNo, I mean harder than the fairly challenging neo-retro games like Cave Story and Shovel Knight.\nNo, I mean harder than the REALLY hard retro games like the Castlevania and Ninja Gaiden series.\nNo, I mean harder than tough-as-nails neo-retro stuff like La-Mulana and probably even Super Meat Boy.\nYeah, you heard that right.  I'd say this game is harder than Super Meat Boy.  Maybe even I Wanna Be the Guy.\nBut.. in a different way.  A more thoughtful way.  I daresay a better way.\nBut do you like them?  Then this game's probably for you!\n\nSeriously though, unlike those other games I mentioned that either aren't that hard to begin with or bank on extreme difficulty just for the sake of it and usually though unforgivingly pixel-perfect platforming and extreme precision-memorization, the likes of which didn't even exist to nearly to such a degree in the 8-bit-era games they claim to be trying to emulate, Spelunky is simply difficult in that it has an extremely high skill ceiling... and I would say a pretty high skill 'floor'.  You can play the tutorial and mess around in the game as a complete gaming amateur that only understands the very basics of platforming and smacking things with a whip, but to really get anywhere or do anything, there's a LOT you're going to need to get used to, learn, experience and master.  I'd definitely compare it most closely out of what I listed to the 'Castlevania/Ninja Gaiden' and Cave Story/La-Mulana groups, inspired by classic games that required lots of play and development and refinement of skill rather than split-second platforming perfection or mind-numbing memorization.. which is to say, a superior type of 'extreme difficulty' than the likes of Super Meat Boy and its ilk (as much as I do enjoy that game).  I'd also compare it to a sort of 2d Dark Souls/Monster Hunter in a similar way, except replace "very difficult bosses to master" with "very difficult traps and stage setups to master".\n\nExcept.. unlike all of those, Spelunky is a roguelike.  Well, kinda; there's not realy any direct RPG elements per se like most Roguelike-subgenre games tend to have, but it has that nature of "procedurally generated content and when you die, you have to start all over".  And considering it's a tough-as-nails sidescroller in which you start with a whopping 3 hp, things even very early on can deal multiple hp worth of damage, there are traps around every corner and even falling a long distance can hurt you... well, you're gonna be starting all over a LOT.  But that's the beauty of it; it's extremely difficult to advance, and you will die hundreds of times in the first area even after you've finally reached the second for example, but every single death brings more lessons learned and more experience gained (experience for YOURSELF as a GAMER rather than your character) as you metaphorically will 'gain levels and stats', to put it one way, in your ability to play the game itself and thus become more and more likely to advance further, collect more treasure, try out more powerups and face more enemies and obstacles with each subsequent attempt.  Needless to say, it's very, very satisfying as you feel your skill raise in this way, no matter how many times you die.\n\nMy one real complaint is that, well, quite frankly, that 3 hp health pool does feel a little bit *too* low and ways to recover it are woefully few and far between, and tend to be very weak.  Luckily there is no actual health cap and you can keep gaining more and more hp to use throughout your run, but barring the specific 'blood-collecting' method which requires a good deal of luck anyway, it's gonna be very tough going, especially considering that you have to sacrifice several of the few tickets to more health you have to get said blood-collecting item.  You'll find yourself wishing quite often that the default health was 5 or so and there were more ways to recover it just so you could simply learn more per run, but alas, in a way such a stringent limitation to your life forces you to game even harder, be even more wary of everything and learn even more as you carefully make your way through the maps.\n\nIf you're on the fence about this game, I highly recommend checking out the free, original 8bit version and see what you think.  This remake with its smooth graphics and superb soundtrack (easily rivalling the NES-like original which I adored) does deserve your money if you even think you'd enjoy it, though.","July 18, 2014","true","5.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RaefGall/recommended/239350/","RaefGall","RaefGall","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RaefGall/","298 products in account","I recently reviewed this game for my game review blog, Five Penny Review. If you enjoy this review, please visit my page:\nhttp://fivepennyreview.blogspot.com/2013/04/spelunky.html\n(Note: This review was based on the freeware game, which this game is an enhanced version of.)\n\nWhat sets this game apart?\nSpelunky is a very simple game.  You play as an Indiana-Jones-esque explorer with a bullwhip and fedora, progressing through 16 stages in four blocks while collecting treasure, fighting monsters, and saving damsels in distress.  What makes Spelunky different than other platformers is that it could be classified as a rogue-like game.  For those who aren’t familiar with the term, rogue-like games feature randomly generated levels and permanent death.  Each of the four blocks provides some variables to the stage layout, but each is otherwise random.  When you die, you start over from the beginning.  This makes it both a challenging and addictive platformer with infinite potential.\n\nWhat is the difficulty factor?\nThis game is a great example of “easy to learn, difficult to master.”  There is a short tutorial level available, but not required.  As with most platformers, the core of the controls is run, jump, and attack.  You get access to other tools, starting with bombs that remove tiles in an area and ropes that allow you to climb up or down to new areas.  Eventually you may come across weapons, mining implements, relics, and other gear such as parachutes and compasses.  While the basic mechanics of the game are very straight forward, the multitude of tools can take some experimentation.\n\nFrom a challenge perspective, I have to start by saying that while the concept is simple, this game is intentionally hard.  Killing enemies and making your way to the exit using minimal items doesn’t seem like it should be hard, but every strike and every jump has to be perfect.  Chances are you will die a lot.  The good news is, unlike most rogue-likes, this game has a sort of check point system.  When you reach the end of each block for the second time, you will be given the chance to pay an NPC to dig a shortcut for you.  The amount you have to donate will likely take you several trips, but the result is the option to start at stage 5, 9, or 13 instead of back at 1 every time.  This takes what would be a nearly impossible task for most players and gives them smaller goals along the way, making the game much less frustrating and more fun.\n\nDoes it use media effectively?\nWhile Spelunky sports a great retro look with sprite graphics and chiptune music, they are by no means its selling point.  Everything in the game is recognizable and well designed, and each of the four blocks has its own tile set, music, and troupe of enemies and traps.  The game looks much better on a smaller screen or in windowed mode, however.  An enhanced version of the game was released in 2012 on the X-Box Live Arcade, which keeps same designs and gameplay, while greatly enhancing the graphics.\n\nBest moment in the game?\nAs this is a game driven much more by mechanics and goals than story, I feel like the best moment in the game is likely reaching a goal rather than a specific point in the game.  The obvious goals like beating the last boss, unlocking a check point, or even simply not dying are great, but I have to say that the best moment is successfully reaching the hidden area: The Lost City of Gold.  This is not an easy task to accomplish, and while just reaching it is a goal, the heaps of treasure you can obtain within will likely give you a high score you will never match.\n\nWho needs to play this game?\nThis game is a great pick up and play option for anyone who is a fan of classic games that has anywhere from 10 minutes to 10 hours to kill.  This is not a game for the easily frustrated, as there are a lot of ways that your hard work can be undone with a split second mistake (my total win/death count is around 3/1000).  Short term goals like check points make this more tolerable, and eventually the goal changes from beating a block to achieving a high score.  The enhanced version is available for X-Box Live Arcade, Playstation Network, and Steam. The classic version is available for download here: http://spelunkyworld.com/original.html","November 28, 2013","true","15.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It gives you a gentle push in the right direction, like a father teaching a son how to ride a bike. It watches eagerly as you improve and master the game.\nSpelunky pushes you onto the ground and beats you again and again with a club until you agree to its terms. Then, it watches as you try to survive and fail yet again. And it laughs.\nBut when you conquer the average game, you feel like you've done no more than a walk down a straight path.\nWhen you conquer Spelunky, you feel like you've climbed the mountain.\nCOME PLANT YOUR FLAG UP HERE WITH THE REST OF US!","January 30, 2015","true","44.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/robert_h_curry/recommended/239350/","robert_h_curry","Robert","http://steamcommunity.com/id/robert_h_curry/","325 products in account","Spelunky is a modern masterpiece. It's as close to perfect as it is possible for a game to be. Every element is deliberately designed to fit together into an intricate system in which each failure teaches you something and prepares you that little bit better for the next game.\n\nIts genius is in applying the traditional "roguelike" elements - randomly generated areas, high cost of player death, and learnable systems - into the approachable form of the platformer. No single element of the game is terribly challenging. Each monster, trap, item, and weapon has a very simple behaviour and is easily mastered. Once you see how a bat moves, you know how to deal with the next one. However Spelunky rarely gives you a series of single challenges, but a mix of several all at once: so while a single bat is no problem, a bat, a spike trap and a spider is something else.\n\nThis is the heart of what makes Spelunky so great. Because the levels are randomly generated, you can't memorise them, and instead have to learn the underlying systems. You're constantly having to quickly eye up a situation, apply what you know about the world, and work out a way to get through it. Even though you can get very skilled at the first few levels you never cruise through on autopilot as the arrangements of obstacles always offers a challenge.\n\nAnd no matter how good you get, there is always some way to test yourself even more. I recently defeated the game the easy way, so the next challenge is to find the secret areas and hidden levels and defeat them too. I know what is involved and some of it seems eye-wateringly difficult. But I'd have it no other way!","March 14, 2015","true","98.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Dying starts you over at the beginning. You lose everything.\n2. The levels are randomly generated. Sometimes they are a breeze, but more often than you'd expect to be ok with, you're thrown into a Rube Goldberg machine of death.\n3. You will die. A lot.\n\nThis is an amazing and addicting game.
