Back in 1996, Rogue Entertainment made it's debut with the most ambitious use of the Doom engine yet. Strife hit the scene as the first true story-driven FPS/RPG hybrid. Using a hub system quite similar to Hexen, Strife also added in NPCs, voiced dialog, and actual conversation choices that affect the outcome of the game. Compared to the mindless run and gun action of previous Doom-based games, this was quite a refreshing change. And now 18 years later Night Dive Studios has taken this amazing classic, and given it the kind of re-release that quite frankly I wish could be done for every Doom-engine game!\n\nRight off the bat when you start up Strife: Veteran Edition you're greeted with a plethora of options, ranging from enhanced music to widescreen views, FOV, bloom, and all the other trimmings. You want delicious crunchy pixels? You got it! Smoothed filtering your kinda thing? It's there too! Night Dive Studios has replaced the "vanilla" doom engine with a massively reworked version of the hit source port Chocolate Doom. Despite the source code for Strife being lost to the ages, they have managed to completely reverse-engineer the game, and bring it perfectly into the modern age.\n\nEverything that made Strife what it is is completely intact here, and it all holds up very well considering the game's age. From the games stealth elements to its vicious deathmatch mode, this package is just dripping with juicy goodness. The original manual, town map, and field guide are all included as .pdf files, and the Roland SC-55 soundtrack is present as ogg files. Speaking of music, if you want to experience the oldschool synthesizer charms of retro Adlib sound, you can turn on OPL3 music in the sound settings.\n\nAs if all of the above wasn't good enough, Night Dive has also augmented Strife: Veteran Edition with a set of trading cards, badges and achievements. They are also planning further additions such as a "capture the Chalice" multiplayer mode, and better automapping. If only id Software would hire Night Dive to give Doom, Heretic and Hexen this kind of epic overhaul. Those games sorely need it as the janky Dosbox setup they have on Steam is just not pretty. Strife: Veteran edition is a shining example of what happens with a game company is passionate about both the game at hand, and giving their customers the best experience possible.\n\n10/10","December 12, 2014","true","2.2"," 173 of 186 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","173","186","0","7"

It's EASILY the best game released using Doom Engine. It feels almost like an earlier version of Deus Ex with its post apocalyptic cyberpunk inspired setting that has you running around a city hub taking & completeing jobs for various NPC in the game while finding, earning, & buying upgrades for your character & his arsenal. Its a damn shame it had to drop a month before the likes of Quake. Thanks to this almost no one has ever heard of it, and it was doomed (no pun intended) to launguish in relative obscurity never recieving the recognition it deserved. Believe it or not, this is the game that pioneered interactive AI allies & ingame storytelling in an FPS, things Half-Life was later was credited for. This truly is not only the best Doom Engine Game but also one of the greats forgotten gems of all time.","December 13, 2014","true","21.0"," 61 of 65 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","61","65","0","1"

It's kind of like Deus Ex before Deus Ex even existed. What you get with this game is an open world which lets you interact with lots of different NPC's and kill lots of bad guys with rocket launchers and machine guns. The puzzles and design is a bit like Hexen but much less confusing.

The game is built more like an RPG with mission based objectives. You play as a wandering mercenary who joins the resistance toward a corrupt government of cyborgs known as The Order. All of the characters in the game are really memorable and really well voice acted. It also features multiple endings, and overall the story is really engaging. Especially for a game released in 1996 with comic book cutscenes.\n\nStrife also features hub levels like Hexen, where you revisit a central town location regularly to purchase ammunition and health items prior to a mission. The game also takes place in an interconnected world similar to Metroid. Where you can backtrack to prior mission areas if you so desire to uncover secrets you might have missed. Later on in the game the levels get much more sprawling and the level design in general gets more unique.\n\nStrife is one of my favorite fps/rpg games. While it wasn't the first one to try the concept, it was probably the first one to do it really well. It's a very enjoyable and simple game to play and if you're a fan of games like Deus Ex and System Shock I guarantee you'll like it.\n\nThis re-release also includes the original WAD files that Strife shipped with back in 1996. So if you're not a fan of this particular port of the game, you can copy those into your favorite Doom source port like gzDoom or Skulltag. Happy hunting.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=355314412","December 13, 2014","true","6.6"," 54 of 60 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","54","60","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/velcrosasquatch/recommended/317040/","velcrosasquatch","Velcrosasquatch™","http://steamcommunity.com/id/velcrosasquatch/","582 products in account","Strife was originally released in 1996 on a modified doom engine, it was unique for its time because it combined elements of RPGs with dooms run and gun gameplay. The result was a cult classic that has garnered fan projects and restorations, but sadly it was forgotten amongst the other big PC games like Duke Nukem 3D and Quake. Until this re-release I was convinced many forgot about Strife, thankfully I was wrong as the devs who ported this cared very much about the game. Strife: Veteran Edition is thankfully not just Strife shoved in with dosbox, it is an actual port based mainly off of the Chocolate Strife source port. It contains the original IWADs and the ability to play it as it was in 1996. It also adds a large amount of modern new features and customization options. An optional bloom lighting system and motion blur have been added along with objective/damage indicators and weapon recoil. I'd easily recommend this version of Strife to anyone looking for a good action game, its a very unique experience and this port only enhances it.","December 12, 2014","true","20.7"," 47 of 52 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","47","52","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CueZero/recommended/317040/","CueZero","CueZero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CueZero/","1640 products in account","Back in the 90's when First Person Shooters were gaining the most momentum there was an abundance of ingenious and ambitious usages of the legendary Doom engine, and while titles like Quake and Duke Nukem were the most talked about at the time there was one debut title from the great Rogue Entertainment whose mechanics influenced an emergence of now familiar and relied on mechanics. Strife finally marks its comeback in a more modern and accessible package for both fans old and new.\n\nMost importantly, this is an incredibly solid port that is consistent with the quality you'd expect from Night Dive and then some. All modern resolutions are included here as well as graphical improvements in the form of dynamic lighting, bloom, and customizable motion blur. Controls have been tweaked to fit the playstyle of modern shooters, and objectives now glow with a circle on the minimap creating a much smoother and seamless quest hunt. Night Dive Studios has given Strife all of the needed customization to allow players of any background enjoy the game however they please, be it in its original intended form or with all the new bells and whistles.\n\nAn extraterrestrial meteorite strikes your planet, unleashing a mysterious virus ravaging the brains of those it infects. Society has been split into two, the infected who have become cruel and barbaric rulers over the uninfected and powerless civilians. You are one of the uninfected who have banded together to create their own rebel community and fight this infected authority that reigns over your lives known only as The Order.\n\nStrife features a large and detailed town hub unlike any FPS before it due to its population of many colorful, grizzled citizens and their connected questlines with fully voiced dialogue trees, the exploration within this community feeling fluid and engaging even after all these years. Here you've got all the staple establishments used throughout the RPG medium. The tavern provides you with side quests to perform for cash as well as tidbits of valuable info that comes at a price, the hospital sells valuable potions to heal during combat, and the weapon and armor shop sell the valuable equipment needed to advance through the harder levels found throughout the world.\n\nOnce you've met up with your underground resistance group of rebels the game opens up, as you take quests and carry out important mission from the various NPCs you'll find scattered around the sprawling town. Different strongholds and hidden corridors throughout the outskirts of the town play host to these missions following classic FPS action, and will reward you with scavenged loot and money in the form of quest rewards to purchase new equipment or much needed medical kits before delving into newer, harder territory.\n\nWhile it certainly isn't the first FPS/RPG hybrid to ever be created, I feel it was the best original attempt to really get it right with a user friendly combination of addictive RPG progression within a fast and furious world of Doom-like violence. Fans of the engine and of the era in general will be drawn to the reminiscent visuals and their application to a unique fantasy world, an extremely pleasant departure from the usual bleak and gray environments we're used to from shooters of that period. The nostalgic Roland powered music is especially delightful here, and takes an extremely adventurous turn in composition.\n\ntl;dr\nIf you've never played Strife there is no better time to discover and enjoy a legend, and if you're an old fan of Strife this is the perfect excuse to go back and experience it again in its most polished form to date.","January 16, 2015","true","14.5"," 45 of 49 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","45","49","3","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sonatafanatica/recommended/317040/","sonatafanatica","SonataFanatica","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sonatafanatica/","401 products in account","The original version of this game is one of the few first-person shooters I have in its original big box in my classic game collection shelves – and the reason is simple: it's just overwhelmingly good! Why?\n\nWell, the game was way ahead of its time, back in 1996. Just think of it as a mission-based, story-driven "Doom"-clone with an open world. This description still doesn't do the game full justice, but it's a good way to at least categorize it.\n\nI've re-played the original game during the Christmas holidays in 2010 and thoroughly enjoyed every second of it. The comic-style artwork and the voice acting really reminds me of the style of the classic adventure game "Beneath a Steel Sky", the faction of The Order feels like a high-tech version of the Hammers from the "Thief" trilogy (by the way: "Thief 2014" doesn't exist...) and the open world has a very unique feel to it. It offers a nice opportunity to experiment a bit with choices and outcomes. Getting your secret "underground rebellion missions" via in-ear radio feels really immersive, too!\n\nThankfully, this updated Veteran Edition doesn't change the original too much. Just a very comfortable new Full HD engine with complete mouse look, high quality textures, dynamic lighting and bloom and a rich variety of options to customize the game to your liking. Oh, and Steam achievements, too.\n\nThis was an instant buy – and I wholeheartedly recommend this game!\nGo buy it. It's WELL worth the asking price!","December 13, 2014","true","12.1"," 35 of 38 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","35","38","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/317040/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","Strife: Quest for Sigil, aka Strife: Trust No One, aka The Original Strife, aka Strife Not MOBA, is a FPS that came out in 1996, developed by Rogue Software. It's known for still using Doom engine, albeit a modified one, and mixing a bit of RPG elements into it, like a next step from Hexen.\nIt was counted as abandonware as Rogue Software went bankcrut and source code was lost too for a long time. But Night Dive Studio, known for bringing games into legal digital age out of void of rights conspiracies, got contacted by developers and hired two Doom community members who were able to reverse-engineer the game, also basing their work from Chocolate Strife project, which allows you to run Strife without DOSBox or any fancyness. Plus artist. And so in 2014 we got Veteran Edition for Steam, which brings it to modern standarts, uses Steam features and got few more additions.\nThus I conclude my inglorious Wiki research.\n\nTechnical-wise, this game should work well, with widescreen-support and many other things. Though I heard some complaints that some fail to run this game. Strange.\n\nMultiplayer is said to be quite early and as you can guess there is not multiplayer community actively playing it. Like, gee, what did you expect, especially when there is Skulltag/Zandronum multiplayer source port for all Doom engine games.\n\n\nThe plot is quite simple in that you are mercenary who was taken for interrogation by the Order, religious dark monarchy which took over the land. And now you shall rebel and search for the Front, the resistance. And then weird stuff. With plotholes.\nSetting is awesome, being mix of tech and colorful medivel.\nAnd so you will talk with NPCs, with main ones being awesomely voiced, sometimes choosing an answer, but mostly moving along the linear path. Still fun.\n\nAs for the game itself, well, it's a Doom clone mostly. With a bit of RPG and very light weird stealth. Then again, "Doom clone" usually stands as "good game" in my book.\n\nAnd I have hard time writing anything interesting about action part of a game. It's fine. You got few weapons, inlcuding super-gimmick weapon that zaps your health. There are few types of enemies. You also got interesting weapons, inlcuding mini-bazooka, which isn't as strong as expected but at least it's more accurate than assault rifle in early game, or crossbow with electric bolts which is equal to pistol, or grenade launcher which is powerful as hell, but only if you master it enough not to have it bounce two offset grenades back at you.\n\nAnd it's mostly unrefined, you mostly will be attacked by hitscan or fast projectiles. So it's not awesome as in Id games, mostly on Build engine games level. At least I wasn't frustrasted here. Mostly because the game be default automatically uses two types of medkits from inventory when you are low on health, so the way it works you pretty much have extended lifebar. And healthkits are very common in this game.\n\nThen there is a bit of erm stealth, as some may note. There are two weapons in the game that will not alert the current sections. Dagger-punch and poison bolt. Punching people into face may take a while and enemies who see you will wake up. On other hand, poison bolt insta-kill organic things, but doesn't harm robots.\n\nAnd look, it's probably there just to have town sections working, where you aren't supposed to kill anybody. Yep, there is such section, with shopkeepers to buy ammo and health and items from. And so this stealth is weird. You can shoot poison bolt into face of acolyte in front of everybody and no one will care. And most robots will always chase to kill you even if you didn't activate the alarm, while everybody is totally cool with murder robots on the loose. If anything, it feels like you are a sly person who abuses his civilian rights in the world of robot laws. Which would make a pretty interesting game, hm.\nNo, no level can be stealthed. Only to some point to feel pro about knowing the map. Too many mandatory alarm-activated gates. So back to Doom clone gameplay.\n\nAnd it has light RPG elements. Mostly that you can talk with some NPCs and buy stuff. And travel to any level you already beat. And town. And you got two stats you can increase by completing missions, sorta: accuaricy and stamina. Accuaricy is about slowly turning your Assault Rifle from shotgun to all-range weapon that runs out of bullets fast. By the way, no, Targeter item doesn't increase it, it just points out how bad it is. Stamina increases your max health and strenght of a punch. So you could stealth those spiders better.\nAlso, almost no other interesting inventory item, aside from teleporter beacon which sends in weak ally rebels so you could horde bullets from them.\n\n\nNow, let's talk about excellent Veteran edition. It changed many things, however it has a lot of options you can tweak, to enable motion blur or to make it play and look close to original. It even keeps unaltered original wad files in the folder. It actually looks very good on default setting. Usually Doom engine games look very flat in OpenGL when compared to Software, which avoids flatness by employing fog-like light effect. But thanks to having lightmaps and making light sources to give off OpenGL light, it looks damn excellent.\nPlus mouse control.\n\nThey also went ahead and removed all the nasty dead ends. In original you could die by choosing dialog option which offends character enough to call infinite spawn of guards, for some reason. Chalice item also was a red herring, which makes it impossible to talk with important NPC who will try to kill you now, probably making your only save slot in original version useless. Dropping item didn't do anything, nope. Now most offending dialog were removed and Chalice just will punish you slightly, but not put you into dead end. I approve.\n\nDid I tell you that this version includes the demo campaign as well? Nope, chalise quest wasn't changed there as it's the only quest and you have to figure out what to do. It's fun and different from full version.\n\nThere is extra content too. You now have three medallions to collect in whole game which gives you the berserker powerup, insta-killing things with melee. It was a scrapped thing in original version that you could get by giving yourself through console, cheating. Related to this new quest line of sorts, there was a blue chalice hidden as well which will give you access to totally new secret level where red medallion is waiting for you!\n\nMultiplayer is also supported too. Well, original and Veteran both only have competetive multiplayer of deathmatch. Which probably isn't much good. Like when you try to turn single-player into DM. With levels. And weapon progression. And for some reason developers of Veteran edition decided to make three new levels that play like CTF when you run them. Capture The Chalice, actually. As if they seriously were thinking that more than two people will play this at the same time.\n\n\nAnd to be honest, even though I beat this game fully now, I still think of it as "that obscurish Doom family game". It was pretty nice during the first part of a game, when you do preparation to attack the nearby castle by doing quests in a town, with more or less nice level design, ending with a climax battle for a castle with stupid ally rebels.\nBut after that, it was more of meh experience, being less interesting. With level design of semi-realistical 90s shooters. When mazes don't have abstract flow of id games, just being mazey for sake of it. Like, sewers. Or catacombs. Or generic overcomplex-looking factories. Or my ever hated "grand palaces that are symmetrical for both sides".\n\nPretty fine 90s Doom clone.","December 6, 2015","true","13.3"," 35 of 41 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","35","41","0","0"

How did games devolve from this into brown/gray, linear, cinematic slogfests that play themselves?\n\nStrife is an FPS-RPG hybrid which is said to be one of the original games of the like, set in a world ruled by a tyrannous cult known as The Order in which you play part of a rebellion which plots to overthrow them. The game itself plays like a mixture of DooM and Duke 3D with fast paced combat that relies heavily on maneuverability/skill and the missions in Strife are open ended which allow for a lot of freedom and exploration.\n\nThis has got to be one of the best looking games I've ever played to this day, it has tons of rich colours and the textures all fit perfectly with each other instead of the monotonous garbage that passes off for games these days that consist only of disgustingly bland mixtures of brown and gray. The sound is great, the weapons feel heavy and powerful and the game is complimented by what has to be one of the most badass soundtracks in gaming.\n\nStrife is definitely worth the 9.99 asking price (currently 7.49 on sale) given that it is a complete masterpiece in every regard. I wish gaming would return to what made it great in the first place but until then I've got plenty of classics like this to play through again.","December 14, 2014","true","10.4"," 39 of 48 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","39","48","2","10"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/biendeo/recommended/317040/","biendeo","Biendeo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/biendeo/","835 products in account","Long story short: An extremely obscure gem, mixing shooter and pseudo-RPG mechanics into a perfect blend. Though very difficult, if you like games such as System Shock 2 or Deus Ex, Strife is an excellent example of the genre fusion well before anything else was done. And it's worth picking up if you like retro shooters in general.\nI love Strife. I love the engine, the overworld, the shooting, the secrets, everything. It's one of those games that just reeks of originality and ingenuity that it's hard to even come to grips with the fact that it disappeared off the face of the planet shortly after it was released. The Veteran Edition, led by Night Dive Studios, is not only a faithful port of the original game, but also offers a re-done version that fixes up a lot of bugs, adds an unfinished game mode to it, and makes the Doom engine look brand spanking new. And it's glorious.\n\nStrife came out in 1996, a month before Quake was released. Graphically, it definitely was overshadowed by Quake. The Doom engine could pull off some amazingly large locations and have tonnes of enemies on screen, but Quake was in full 3D, and it looked amazing (and also the level design was ridiculously good too). Strife faded into obscurity as Quake basically became the hall-mark for FPS standards.\n\nStrife is mostly a first-person shooter: you move around, shoot bad guys, and walk around a map completing objectives. It had an inventory system similar to Heretic or Hexen before it, where health packs and other gadgets could be used. It had a bunch of weapons that could be used, and, in the retro shooter fashion, were completely explosive and amazing. My favourite has to be the grenade launcher, which fires two giant bombs forward, which explode into a tower of fiery death. There's also a secondary ammo for that weapon which fires napalm, and man is it devastating.\n\nHowever, it also had a few RPG mechanics thrown in. Firstly, the entire game was a persistent overworld: you start in a main hub, and every level branches off from that, interacting with each other as the game goes on. Military bases become overrun, pathways open up between areas, and so on. You can also talk to almost every human character in the game. While a lot of them don't say anything useful, a few give some nice tips on fighting enemies or navigating the levels. Quite a number of NPCs are voice acted, and it definitely brings the game some life.\n\nOn top of that, levels have a lot of secrets involved with them. With the Veteran Edition, there are 16 that are marked and count towards an achievement (which honestly is not that many), but there are definitely a lot of other hidden away areas that include items, rewarding the player for keeping an eye out for inconsistencies in the level. One kind of secret actually increases your maximum health and makes your weapons more accurate, which is a nice way to reward the player rather than giving a bunch of ammo.\n\nThe story will leads you around a bunch of locations around the world. While it gives the illusion of an open-world game, it's really linear, as you're expected to clear off levels in a specific order. However, quite a few areas allow the player to approach it from different angles, similar to Deus Ex. For a lot of levels, stealth is an option. While the player, in a few areas, can walk around without guards attacking, robots will always hunt the player down, so stealth is more about avoiding enemies than trying to take out each of them one at a time. When stealth goes, the game doesn't make you feel like you've messed up, as your weapons are more than capable of taking down enemies (although on higher difficulties the number of enemies gets ridiculous). A few areas in the game do get quite ridiculous though in terms of irritating enemy placement or level design, but overall there's a lot of good stuff.\n\nA lot of the enemies attack with hitscan-like weapons (or projectiles that move very fast). This can get a bit annoying and can contribute to a lot of deaths in the game. Again, fortunately in the Veteran Edition, a little blip comes up on the screen indicating where you are getting hit from, which makes it easier to react to them. Because of these enemies, your playstyle will move towards a more cautionary stance rather than running in rooms guns blazing. It's an interesting change of pace, but it does get a bit annoying when you die very quickly. Fortunately, hitscanning enemies are also the weaker enemies in the grand scheme of things (akin to Doom), which makes it not as cheap as it could be.\n\nThe story has you up against a few bosses, each one harder than the last. They also require to be hit with the ultimate weapon of the game: the Sigil, which upgrades its damage output and attack style after each boss is defeated. The Sigil uses the player's health as ammo, and it provides an interesting dynamic for the fights: where survivability is more crucial than before.\n\nStrife also has a couple of different endings, and, fortunately, it isn't just a different button at the end of the final room of the game. The endings are determined in the last third of the game, and it changes the course of where you go and such. It's interesting to see a game from almost 20 years ago do this and many other elements so well compared to more modern games.\n\nThe Veteran Edition release not only fixes the original game's bugs, but it also offers the original game as a bonus which is nice. It also uses a fancy OpenGL version of the Chocolate Strife port, which offers bloom and dynamic lighting, but, again, there is an option to use the software renderer and make the game look as old as it originally did. Also the multiplayer is nice and chaotic as most retro shooters seemed to be. However, the player-base is not quite there yet, so it's hard to get into a match.\n\nHowever, of course, the game not only includes support for modding, but it's compatible with a bunch of mods that were made back in 1996. While not as extensive as some other games at the time, there's a lot of good stuff that came out of the modding community back then, which will definitely extend the game's life cycle.\n\nIf you play Strife, you have to remember that it came out in 1996: well before any other shooter RPG hybrid that was big and popular. And it's sad just how amazing this game was. The Veteran Edition release is very faithful in making the game run well on modern systems, as well as making it compatible with older content. The $10 price point is well worth the content. Strife is a magnificent game, and you'll definitely like it if you're into retro shooters or shooter-RPG hybrids in general, or if you just want to play a hard as nails old school game.\n\nRATING: 3 UP, 1 DOWNMy up/down rating system tries to differentiate between games that are mediocre (less ups and downs total), and games that are interesting but flawed (more ups and downs totals).

As a result, people pretty much forgot it existed. It's a remarkably ground-breaking non-linear FPSRPG that kind of shattered contemporary conventions, long before the days of Far Cry, Borderlands or Destiny (but following in the footsteps of 1993's Pathways into Darkness and 1994's System Shock).\n\nNotably, all copies of its source code were completely lost and so, modern versions of the game running on source ports rely on reverse-engineering. That's where the Veteran Edition comes in, and it's clear that a lot of care has gone into crafting it. Not only have you got modern OS support, customizable keybinds, along with bells and whistles like bloom, motion blur, high-res textures and so on, but you've also got the original version of the game for purists or curious folk and, on top of that, the reconstruction of unfinished features in the original game, which is pretty damn neat.\n\nThe game itself holds up remarkably well to this day. It's far from the highly immersive, airtight, diegetic experiences from nowadays, but exploring it and making gradual progress through the world feels incredibly rewarding. Gameplay is fun and challenging, and the world itself looks pretty good and most environments offer a good sense of realism and sense of purpose.\n\nIn a lot of ways, it feels like a lot more than just an underrated game from 1996; it's distinctly ahead of its time and so, playing it feels totally unlike a step backwards in any way. In fact, it feels just as fun, and perhaps more so, than some of the games of today it predated. To sum up, it's a really good game and you should go spend money on it.","December 24, 2014","true","2.6"," 21 of 21 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","21","21","0","0"

Think of it as the grandfather of games like the original Deus Ex, System Shock 2 or the original Thief.\n\nAbout the original game\nInteresting scifi/fantasy world. Levels are connected by a hub system instead of being linear one after the other; you start in a town and from there you can go to many different areas, some of them opening up as you advance the story. You will be given missions to complete, that's how you advance the story. Depending on some decisions the story will have minor forks. Some quests can be completed going stealth but in other cases you have to go full postal. Nice variety of weapons, from a stealthy crossbow to a destructive BFG-like thingy.\nOther RPG elements in the game: leveling up system even if it's very simple, item stores, inventory system, plenty of NPCs to interact with...\n\nAbout the "Veteran Edition" release\nBut wait, that's not all, Night Dive Studios has done an excellent job improving the game for the "Veteran Edition" version: support for higher resolutions more fitting for current day monitors, a whole new optional area in the story, a few new secrets (hidden talismans), multiplayer support (capture the chalice), steam achievements...\n\nOverall, Strife is an underappreciated timeless classic, one of those games every "gamer" should have played.

It was released a month before Quake.\nQuake:June 22, 1996\nStrife:May 31, 1996\nSo at the time after had their eyes and attention focus on Quake rather then Strife which is why you've never even heard of this game.\nSo what do i have to say about it?\nWell since a friend of mine showed me Strife and figured it'd be in my interest to try it out due to the fact i love Retro FPS games i decided to buy it this week when i got money and boy was it a good decision.\nThe game is RPG/FPS hybrid of sorts. I guess since their's stuff like Multi endings and you only get to level up your accuracy and health.\nSo the game takes place in a time where i dunno tbh but yea. A comet of types hits earth and some sickness came and killed millions and then some went mad and heard voices in their head and created a group know as the order which is composed of cyborgs and all hell breaks lose. You are a wondering mercenary that stumbles across this land and you end joining a group called the rebellion that is planning on destroying the order. So it's one of those FPS games which is always fun.\nSo now the gameplay. Gameplay is rather fun.\nYou get 7 or 8 weapons if i remember correctly and that's it really. You can buy med kits and ammo and armor from 3 different shops. Medic,weapon,and armor. While of course talking and meeting many different types of characters along your quest for the 5 Sigil  pieces.\nMusic on the other hand is okay it goes from Serious and dark toned to jammy and catchy.\nAnd that's about it. Also NOTE This game can be very very unforgiving for the first time so if you're not using a walktrough then their's a high chance you'll end up screwing yourself out of winning. How to avoid that is to not go GTA on every civilian you see.\nSo in short. Great game. Appealing to both Sci fi and Fantasy fans.\n8/10~Great game.\nBut i'm docking it some points due to the fact the difficulty at times can be bull and way too confusing level design.\nIf you're a fan of Doom,Hexen,Quake or any other retro FPS game. Give Strife a try.\nIf you're a fan of old,underrated hidden gems then you'd also might wanna give strife a try.\n","February 12, 2015","true","29.6"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","19","20","0","4"

The problem is that not many people knew the game because it was released 3 months before Quake and was left behind because of the dated technology.\nBut i tell ya, Strife is one of the best games ever made. And with this version, its even more awesome.\nFirstly, i love the aspect of the "Story builds up on the choices you make", that means that if you got a choice the story will develope branches, and you will end up in other levels or meeting other people.\nSecondly, the people you meet. Sometimes you will meet people who will betray you, sometime you will just meet ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, and sometimes you will meet people who are friendly and will help you.\nThe weapons feel awesome, and all are useful, cant expand more on that.\nIn this version the visuals in the game look really good, shaders, smooth textures and sprites lightning, and motion blur, looks real good.\nMusic is great.\nMultiplayer has great potential and is overall fun but needs little fixes there and there but overally its fun and good, and I believe that its just about time till the workshop comes.\nIn a conclusion, this is the must have.

They've smoothed out many  of the rough elements of the original Strife, added some useful/cool new features, and generally done a great job at making Strife look and play better without really touching the game itself.\n\nHere's a few of the improvements:\n\nHigh-resolution 3D-accelerated rendering engine with tweakable settings for pretty much everything. I think the bloom filter defaults are pretty good, but whatever your preference is, you can set it. You can even select the original software renderer if you want the old Doom engine look.\nImportant quest items are now highlighted with a flashing outline when enemies drop them.\nMajor mission objectives now have waypoints marked on the map screen.\nI've only tested controller support with a wired Xbox 360 controller, but man does it work well.\nAn unused UI element for the secondary fire mode of the Mauler has been implemented. This makes the immediate distinction between fire modes a lot clearer.\nThe original soundtrack can be played back in either a tinny-but-classic FM-chip version, or a superior pre-recorded MIDI version using good instrument samples.\nAs for the game itself, Strife is a FPS/RPG hybrid with a heavy leaning towards the former. The FPS elements are interesting in that several of the weapons can hurt you if you're not careful - especially the grenade launcher and secondary fire mode of the Mauler. If you learn to use the weapons effectively, however, they can make you feel like a total badass. You cannot stealth through the whole game, but many areas allow you to get through with minimal killing if you'd like, and one achievement is based around doing this in a specific area.\n\nThe plot involves a couple of twists that you may or may not see coming. There's a couple of major areas that only open up if you take the path to the "Good" ending, and one or two that you can just simply miss by not exploring the levels enough.\n\nThe RPG elements of Strife involve branching NPC dialogue trees, (optional) upgrades to accuracy and health, and 3 different endings. This is nothing special today, but at the time, nobody had put all those features into a FPS, let alone a Doom engine game. The spoken dialogue is variable in quality - some characters are believable, others a little over-the-top. Thankfully, it's all way above the quality of many other old-school games.\n\nYou have essentially a running commentary from Blackbird (a female NPC who talks to you via your comm unit) throughout most of the game. It's a great idea that often helps to give the game some personality, as well as a reminder of where you need to go next.\n\nThen, there's the secrets. Holy heck are there a lot of secrets in this game. I discovered a few secret areas here and there in my original playthroughs, and was pretty satisfied with myself. When I went about trying to get the "Completionist" achievement in this version, I noticed that many of the secrets I knew didn't even count towards the total. I'm now pretty humbled. To be fair, some of the secrets are not at all obvious, and some basically require bumping into/trying to open every square inch of every level [(The transparent wall secrets are some of the worst offenders in this category)]. Also, Night Dive *added* some secrets to this version of Strife, most notably the Talismans (which are a seperate accheivement). I'm currently running through the game specifically trying to find every secret without consulting a walkthrough. It's not easy.\n\nOkay, so there's also some stuff that doesn't hold up so well:\n\nBlackbird often comments on NPC dialogue - but sometimes she doesn't start talking until at least a second after the NPC's line has finished. If you're used to rushing through dialogue trees, you might miss about half of her lines - and there's no indication of which lines she'll speak on. Not critical, but annoying.\n\nThe graphics are kind of blocky. This version has done a nice job of subtly filtering textures once they get a certain distance from the player, but this is still a Doom engine game. Thankfully, the overall art design is colorful and far from the bland color schemes of more recent FPSs.\n\nThe music is variable in quality, with some tunes adding to the intensity of combat  especially the castle assault, and some becoming incredible repetitive after a while; the music in the sewer levels becomes especially grating.\n\nWhile the lack of handholding in finding mission objectives is a nice change from modern games, there are some levels where it's very easy to get lost and not know what to do/where to go next. The objective waypoints on the map screen are a nice addition, but the markers are totally static and don't clear when individual objectives are achieved.\n\nThe multiplayer is limited to your Steam friends. This is great if you have several friends who like to play Strife, but it would be nice to have the option to play with strangers as well.\n\nOverall, this is easily the best "re-release with enhancements" I've played, and really helps to show folks what a cool, underappreciated gem Strife was/is.","February 16, 2015","true","17.1"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

Why am I playing Strife in 2015?! Answer: because it is the best FPS game I've ever played, easily topping classics like Quake and Doom.\n\nAfter a comet struck the Earth, a virus spread and those infected not only presented horrible mutations, but also started hearing the voice of a malignant god in their head. They established "The Order" that took the power and oppressed and enslaved those which were not infected. Of course, that's where you come: you play as a newcomer member of The Resistance, seeking to overthrow the Order and its wickedness.\n\nThe game is your classic FPS with some basic RPG elements. You have a main city where you can peacefully shop for supplies, you have a bunch of quests and some decisions that will fork the final outcome of your efforts. MANY secret doors and stashes, hidden rooms and optional sections of maps that you'd explore just because. You lack of a character sheet, skills and the likes, but you will improve your Health and Accuracy along the game, that being the closest to "level up system" you'll find in there. Just like in FPS games, you have a great variety of weapons, but in Strife, THEY ARE DIFFERENT far beyond the "damage" factor, and you'll find yourself resorting to your first crossbow every now and then even at the end of the game.\n\nThe achievements are fun and natural, just encouraging the player to explore more the scenario and teasing with its highest difficulty: Bloodbath. You think you're good just until the enemies start respawning quicker than you can kill them. And THAT'S when you run out of ammo.\n\nLinux port is flawless (thanks for supporting the Penguin!)\n\nThe whole concept is so great and well executed, the voice acting is SO GOOD (gotta love Blackbird! The Governor was also very well executed) I just can't stop asking myself "What year was this game developed again?!?!" This is definitely a winner, NOT your "retro indie" game.

Seeing my favourite genre of immersive media in its period of infancy, where the developers were still learning what works and what doesn't... There is just something magical about it, like watching old black and white movies and insisting they're better in every way to the stuff released today.\n\nOf course they aren't. No movie buff is right when they say Kubrick's works outshine the oscarbait we get in our current decade, no photographer is right when they say pictures just look better taken with their analogue sh**boxes. We see the past with rose-tinted glasses because of many factors; nostalgia, passion, auteur admiration, but none of these make the works of the past outright better. I am saying this to quality my recommendation, because Strife was made in 1996; the games industry has had almost 20 years to innovate since this game was released, and as such, as good as the game is, is just can't outshine IPs such as half-life or the elder scrolls series.\n\nThat being said, I now feel comfortable telling you that this game is probably one of the best games I have ever played.\n\nStrife is made on a heavily modified DOOM engine, but it plays closer to 3Drealms' Duke 3D or Shadow Warrior; you can jump, run, fill your inventory with all manner of useful gadgets, and best of all, the game contains the first example of RPG elements in an FPS game; you level up doing sidequests, you can find gold in secret areas to buy additional health packs or ammo, and the game has multiple endings based on a couple of important choices you make as a player. This sort of innovation boggles my mind for 1996, and it's even stranger to me that I had not even heard of this game until a few weeks ago.\n\nThe levels are scattered with secrets, the crux of which being 3 hidden talismans that the game makes you work like a dog for... When you finally get all three, your reward is... Well, I wont spoil it, but it was the most immensely satisfying prize you can imagine without being something inherently game ending. Strife also Gives you the option to stealth through most levels, again, one of the first FPSes that let you do this. The stealth is a little bit confusing, and isn't explained well, but hey, back in those days games came with a manual. Basically, most new areas bad guys wont consider you a threat until you open fire on them. A reasonable reaction, in my opinion. You can stop the alarms going off by killing secluded enemies with silent weapons; daggers or poison darts so that the inevitable dog-pile of enemies becomes easier to manage when they catch you being a ♥♥♥♥. You can also... you know... just complete your objective and leave without harming anyone; an option that I doubt many people took in 1996, but an option that is mandatory for the bloodbath difficulty which is as to NIGHTMARE mode what the Holocaust is to a teletubbies marathon. Bloodbath is horrendously difficult. I can finish any level of DOOM on nightmare mode but I cant get out of the first ROOM alive on bloodbath.\n\nThe protagonist has a hardcore sidekick named blackbird who, again, in a profound innovation is the first character I have ever heard say the F-word in a video game (chronologically, I mean), which endeared her to me immediately, her ultimate role is a shoehorned love interest but hey it's the nineties, too much innovation and they would have been burned at the steak. The protagonist himself is a relatively nameless, voiceless link character who travels through 20+ levels with a stunning variety of weapons from the humble bread and butter assault rifle to the double-barreled High-Explosive grenade launcher with optional white phosphorous rounds for when you're feeling frisky. Seriously the grenade launcher is in my top 3 weapons from all games, it is an immensely satisfying, unnecessarily powerful death machine.\n\nThe bosses are good, though the only two worth mentioning are the first boss and the last boss. The first boss is a hectic fast paced battle that I barely survived, the last battle was a wonderfully cinematic ultimatum. All the other bosses get one-shot by the stupid sigil weapon (think soul cube from doom 3). This is probably the only nit-pick I have with this game. The enemies are all astounding, peons, mechs and monsters are all well-rounded and have individual character Bosses, enemies and allies are all competently voice acted, my favourite being the snarky peon administrator who just takes one look at the amount of work you went through cheating yourself into the Order's main HQ, sighs, shrugs and waves you through.\n\nStrife is challenging, rewards exploration and proactive thinking, the levels are well designed, it has character, atmosphere, and a satisfying conclusion with loads of wonderful comic book cutscenes. From 1996, this game is exceptional, and if you adjust for inflation, it is phoenominal. If you enjoy First-person games, you OWE it to yourself to play Strife.","May 22, 2015","true","10.8"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/redavatar/recommended/317040/","redavatar","Majestic 12","http://steamcommunity.com/id/redavatar/","1238 products in account","This game was one of the first FPS action RPGs, a genre shared by classics such as Deus Ex and Vampire Bloodlines. Released in 1996, Strife pushed the limits by offering a FPS that didn't involve shooting everything sight. In fact, it was well possible to screw up your game having to start all over by doing something you weren't supposed to.\n\nThe Veteran Edition does its best to bring Strife into the 21st century, luckily. As revolutionary as the game was in 1996, it still had quite a few flaws including only having a single save game. In a game where it's possible to make a wrong move and only finding out half an hour later, this was painful so due to the Veteran Edition having several save games, it starts off by eliminating the biggest flaw of the original.\n\nAnother annoyance from the first game, was its vague mission parameters combined with maze-like locations (like the sewers). While you have a detailed map, you could still get lost for ages. The Veteran Edition helps you out by marking quest locations - another welcome improvement.\n\nBesides these gameplay tweaks, you have the standard graphic and control improvements including fluent mouse look, bloom, higher resolution graphics, proper shading, etc.\n\nWhile Strife won't blow your socks off if you compare it to modern games, it's still a rare gem. Back in the day, it wasn't even that well known and has become a cult classic but it's really worth a look for any games enthusiast.","December 14, 2014","true","8.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jocosity/recommended/317040/","jocosity","Communist "Joseph Ballin" Layton","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jocosity/","920 products in account","Strife is a game that was mostly forgotten during its time, largely due to releasing just a month before Quake, so most people today aren't even aware of what it is.  Strife is a game made on id Tech 1, but it does a lot of interesting things with it that you wouldn't expect to see from the same engine that powered Doom. Strife has more of an RPG atmosphere, and features a persistent semi-open world with stores to shop at, people to talk to, voice acted dialogue, and even a few side quests. There are slight stealth elements, and though it goes more by the old rules of "it's still stealth as long as nobody's alive to sound the alarm" than any particularly fleshed-out system, a few of the game's missions can be played pretty differently by utilizing it. It's not a particularly in-depth RPG, mind you - the only stats you have are health and accuracy, and both are only increased at set moments instead of having any sort of XP system, the world isn't particularly large, and the story is generally pretty linear, outside of 3 or 4 optional levels and side quests, and most of the actual mission levels play more like standard Doom than any sort of RPG, but it's still an interesting take on the Doom formula.\n\nThis particular version includes a few new things that weren't in the original, like a set of talismans that can be found in secret areas and a full new side-level to fight through with a new side quest to go along with it. The veteran edition is generally pretty well-made, but I did have a lot of problems with the vertical auto-aim; with it on, certain weapons like the rocket launcher tend to have a lot of trouble hitting enemies placed higher than you, but with it off I found other weapons like the assault rifle having strange accuracy issues, forcing me to aim about an inch below enemies to actually hit them. Overall, Strife isn't necessarily an amazing game, and the level design can be a bit dull at times, but it's still a pretty fun overlooked game that's interesting to see at the very least, if only to see the unique things they managed to do with the RPG functions.","December 7, 2015","true","13.5"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","0"

I even had suspicions about what I was doing as I did it. I still did it. Reloaded and went a different route. Then I started wondering where the Doom was in this supposed Doom style game.\n\nThen I got to the first actual boss and it all came together. Its got the movement and shooting of doom, the hubworld of zelda games, the humor and style of comix zone. The remaster has a wealth of options to make it 'feel' modern without taking away its classic charm (that I sought it out for). You can experience it as it was released, or essentially emulated with modern filters for smoothing and design sensibilities, or any personal combo between the both.\n\nIn a day of making games fail proof to ensure no gamer gets left behind, this gamer was delighted to die in an endless wave of enemies because he listened to the first shlomo to give him a quest.","May 24, 2015","true","7.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Strife is an odd hybrid type of game; it's a FPS running on the original DOOM engine, with RPG elements and an actual plot. The setting has an odd sci-fi-with-medieval-fantasy-and-Star-Wars-influences feel. The maps feel like a mix between open, realistic architecture (e.g. the Castle, the Commons) and tight, gamey, areas that feel thrown together (e.g. all the hub areas). It has one sidequest that makes the game unwinnable if you complete, which is annoying (at least the sidequest is at the start of the game so you can restart once you realize your current save is broken). And the ending is just so... cringeworthy.\n\nOverall, the game is pretty mediocre, but still fun and I enjoyed it for what it is. It helps that the game is on the Doom engine and the gameplay is nice and fluid, even if all the other parts of the game are pretty lame or just average.","October 12, 2015","true","5.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I used to watch my brothers play these games as I was too young to play them myself.

You are part of a rebel army, doing whatever you can to collect pieces of an artifact which will ultimately help you defeat The Order. How you do that, and the final outcome that happens as a result of your actions, is up to you.\n\nThe one thing that makes this game unique from other shooters of it's era, is that you have the choice as to how the story will turn out in small and large ways. The decisions you make when you talk to NPCs, as well as choosing who to fight and who to not fight, will affect the game temporarily, but will also affect it's final, ultimate outcome.

It is the result of the games Metroid and Castlevania, that had such impact in the game development, that are used as examples nowadays. Strife is to the FPS-RPG genre what Metroid and Castlevania are to platformers.\n\nIt is one of the best titles made on doom engine and it was the first that combined RPG elements to a FPS game, by inserting NPCs, quests and voiced dialogues! A part of gaming history, remade on December 2014, 18 years later than its original release. Strife is a first person shooter with some role playing elements, such as quests, talking with NPCs and some decision making that may, or may not, have direct effect to your gameplay! [spoiler alert: there are 3 endings!]\n\nTruly a hidden gem and a must play for every Doom/Quake/Hexen and even DeusEx (the first) lover. It can be as difficult and demanding as you want it to be with since the Veteran Edition has kept all the features of the Original, difficulty levels included! You can also play the game as its original version (some 'vanilla' bugs are included) or the newer version that has some extras, with or without the newer graphics.\n\nThe story goes that after a meteor crashed on the planet and killed thousands, it spread a virus where the affected got mad by hearing a voice and called themselves 'the order'. Those who could not hear the voice where used as slaves or even guinea pigs, as a result a rebel movement is forged, 'the front', to fight the order. You are a mercenary that gets captured by the order and gets involved with the front. The world, while not extremely huge, may still surprise you given that there are a lot hidden items in seemingly empty areas or even hidden rooms, and a lot of different paths or backdoors in the various levels for you to explore! It also requires some thinking in addition of the mindless killing of baddies! For example: a friendly NPC tells me that in X room there are weapons, but the room is locked. The quest continues and after a while I meet an NPC that mentions that he had just finished stocking some weapons. So.... killing the NPC did gave me the key I needed!\n\nThe only negatives are, the aiming in regards to different levels (higher/lower) that can be clunky even with the games aim assist, few voice dialogues that do not have subtitle support but are quite easy to understand if you pay attention, and the graphics. Now I did not play this game for its graphics and frankly I like this retro-style a lot more than fully 3D games, but the issue is that on first sight the game is a brick of mud, that once you wash it, the gold sparkles!

Not very far.\nGraphics can only do so much.\n\nPut this game up against any other game from that time period.\nWhen you buy it...\nKnow, that you now have access to what was probably the most underrated title of ALL TIME.\nA Title that literally bashed in the door, opening the way for FPS games with "Depth"\n\nSome might argue that it was not the first FPS-RPG.\nIT WAS the first that was easy to pick up and play and didn't look downright hokey.\n\nSo if you like games like Deus Ex, System Shock, Bio Shock.\nThis is pretty much their grandpa, at least the only "playable" one that's worth going back too.\nBecause Ultima Underworld 1+2 (1992-1993) is not an easy game to play, nor is it as good looking.\nIt's all about how it controls.  And Strife is legendary in that regard when in comparison.\n\nI only wish someone would update the 2 Underworld games....Get it running in a real 3D Engine and get 360 controller support out of the box for those.....   I can dream can't I?\n\nAs a side note.  This game doesn't really deserve the FPS-RPG designation, it's more of an adventure.   Because there's no leveling up, there's no character sheet... It has "Some" dialog choices and an inventory.  By todays standards... not an RPG.","December 16, 2014","true","1.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It has some running and gunning but you can also use melee kills to not set off alarms. It takes about eight punches though so after a couple missions it's just best to blow everyone away. It uses a hub system and when you are in town you can't shoot your guns off or you are swarmed by guards. It can get a bit maze-y but shouldn't be too hard to find your way around. It also has a rpg-like upgrade system as well where you can periodically get rewards from the trainers at base command that increase your armor and health. It is a lot like a rpg because you go talk to guys and get missions so it might be the first ever fps action rpg. I never played this much back in the day because Doom, Duke 3D and Heretic were far superior but it is still a good game and this new version is made well. No glitches or crashes so far. Well other than weirdly it gave me some stutter-lag the second time I booted up the game although I had not changed any options. I had to fiddle with some graphics options to make it run smooth again. I am hoping that it doesn't happen again.\n\n7.5/10 good times","July 10, 2015","true","3.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

If you accidentally shoot an NPC, it will enter a wounded state before it dies. You can set baddies on fire, or vaporize them. There is often a degree of freedom as to how you approach encounters, but it's when negotiations break down that the real fun begins.\n\nThe setting, a sort of post alien-invasion medieval England, is instantly likable and fits the story and unique enemies well. Strife is full of shooter innovations that set it far ahead of the pack. Naturally, it was almost completely ignored by the gaming press while simultaneously being borrowed from for years to come.\n\nThis new release is the best version yet, featuring crisp GL graphics, bug fixes, a subtle (and welcomed) map marker system that shows you where you need to go, and a new secret level.","April 30, 2015","true","12.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

While maintaining a steep difficulty level, Strife remains as one of the most comprehensive Doom overhauls ever devised.\n\nFull voiced NPC's, interaction menus, side-quests, and amazing map designs make this game one of the penultimate Doom Engine games. While the original Strife was cancelled and hailed as free-ware for being released far too late into the 90s, Veteran Edition includes several bonuses and extra content, such as the re-implementation of "Capture the Chalice" mode, Objectives being marked on the Auto-Map, and a High-Rez mode that makes the gmae look breathtaking.\n\nStrife is not for everyone, and before you decide if you should buy the game, you should hunt down the original 1996 verson on the internet. It's abandon ware, so it won't cost you anything. Veteran Edition remains a beautiful remake, however, and I highly reccomend you support Night Dive for finally bringing the game to Steam if you're looking to experience it on a more flexible scale.","February 27, 2015","true","0.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The only thing missing is leveling, but money replaces experience ;)\n\nTHE GOOD (7):\n-Extremely tight controls! If you've played DOOM (which I'll reference a lot), you know how Strife plays exactly! This style of control doesn't exist for shooters anymore and it's too bad because the gameplay is quick and exciting. You'll never get frustrated at the controls :)\n-Great story production! Although I'm not very far in the game so I'm not sure about the overall plot, but the game has full voiceover work and even has some cutscenes presented as a stylish comic-book!\n-Multiple endings! I still haven't gotten a chance to beat it, but I read online that there's at least 3 different endings (probably more), and when is that ever a bad thing?\n-Cool Quests! The questing is never more than what it should be. "Go to this area and turn this switch off" or "go kill this guy for some cash". That's all I want and expect from this type of game and it gives incentive to explore some side maps :)\n-The main town! This might seem tiny, but I really like the town! Guards (which are enemies on any other map) won't shoot you, and so long as you don't start killing people at random, you can relax and shop at your leisure.\n-Shops provide ammunation and in some cases new weapons, so you'll be hard pressed to run through the game without ammo, but don't go shooting walls randomly ;)\n-Surprisingly long. I still haven't found time to beat it! After the first boss (which took me a very long time to get to), I thought it was the end of the game. Instead I was presented with a strange new weapon and told that "there's 4 more pieces to that weapon", so I guess there's 4 more bosses!\n\nTHE BAD (3):\n-The music is pretty lame and sometimes outright annoying. It had me laughing and I love how cheesey it is, but the music is bad XD\n-Keeping track of quests can be a bit tricky. This version of the game has added the ability to see quests on your map, this is great! But the icons pointing you where to go won't disappear once you've completed one part of the quest. It will point to the quest giver and the objective at all times, adding more icons for quests that require you to visit multiple locations. Often I found myself backtracking to an area marked on my map only to find I'd already finished that part.\n-Sewers. Once you get to this part, you'll know what I mean.\n\nIf you'd like to see the game in action, here's my First Look :)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY5R7HDmupk\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS:\nWhat can I say? The Original Strife: Veteran Edition is a tight game that any DOOM fan will love! Most other reviews talk about how Strife was overlooked because at the time there were some huge game releases.\nI'm glad I was able to pick this one up :)\n\n-Thanks for taking the time to read this review! I hope you found it helpful in deciding whether to purchase this game!","January 28, 2015","true","2.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I've had to re-acquaint myself with mid-'90s era FPS rules, though (I'll get to that in a bit).\n\nFirst off, the postitives, sans nostalgia:\n\n- Good quest system. You talk to people, join a faction, do the quests, get rewards. No EXP for increases in health or accuracy, those are some of the rewards. Simple.\n\n- The level design is great. There are multiple ways to approach a goal, and each will change how things play out (sneak in the back door and you don't have to fight off the entire city)\n\n- Your choices matter, and you can make a wrong choice. It always bothers me in a game where I supposedly have any choice possible that I can't kill the big baddie right in front of me, even if it breaks a quest.\n\n- Fantastic voice acting, for the most part. A couple minor voiced NPCs are a bit... odd. Not terrible, just a bit "...interesting choice..."\n\n- You can name your saves, and make multiple saves. Again, many modern games don't even let you manually save. I like to be able to know what I was doing in X save at Y time. I have a sheet of paper to keep track of my Skyrim characters -_-\n\nCons:\n\n-If I have my screen set to a resolution lower than the resolution set in the game, it doesn't start (Linux). I'll report this bug at some point. It's not a big deal. I just forgot to set it higher after playing something else once.\n\n- The movement is slippery and floaty. That's accurate to the time it was made, but after playing newer games for so long (though I did start on Wolfenstein 3D) it's a bit rough to go back to this. Not a huge deal, though.\n\n- No real cue as to whether guards are hostile before they start shooting.\n\n- Mouse settings are bizarre. If you turn off mouse acceleration, you lose all mouse movement. Had to balance 3 sliders in 2 menus until I got something useful.  EDIT: Hours after posting this review, the mouse issue was fixed. Very cool.\n\n- Nearly all the NPCs look the same. Can be confusing. Luckily we have the quest markers in this version.\n\nThese are NOT cons! Just things to remember when you start playing, as this game was made in 1995-96:\n\n- This game does _not_ auto-save. If you don't save, you will lose all progress. Happened to me a few times already with me facepalming at my stupidity. It just has so many concepts used in more modern games, I forget!\n\n- Looking up/down does NOT equal aiming up/down. It's convenient in that you can see what's shooting at you, but this is basically DooM, and looking up/down didn't exist back then. Perhaps turning off Classic Mode will change this, but I think I'll stick with this, personally. Really make that Accuracy stat mean something ;)\n\n- All in all, this game holds up pretty dang well. More playable than Daggerfall, I can say that much (and I think I've put a hundred hours or more into Daggerfall this past year. Just saying that this has aged far better. I think I'd say the same even if it were running in the original engine!).\n\nThe greater story depth makes me think it might have aged better than DooM itself! If you're looking to introduce a millenial to 2.5D FPS games, I think this might be the game to do it.

I won't go over what's been said before but I will say that the new engine runs Strife very well, including high resolutions like 3200 x 1800 which I captured with on my Let's Play:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_EI4l0Ou9k\n\nSo along with some modernization tweaks to the original game, what else has been added?\n\n"Capture the Chalice” multi-player mode.\n\nMarking of current objectives on the auto-map.\n\nSpecial HUD for the Torpedo weapon\n\n\nWhile I didn't test out the multiplayer mode or the Torpedo weapon yet, I can say that the marking on the map saved me a considerable amount of time figuring out where I was supposed to go next.  Though I'm sure there is a certain amount of people that would argue that this ruins the game, I'd argue that, indeed, while being told I needed to enter in through the ungaurded pier specifically, my definition of a "pier" and the games definition differ drastically.\n\nAlso it's not listed in the bulleted-list above but the game does offer a more 'accurate' version of the game as well, "including bugs and all".  Which is a neat feature I think.  Though I suppose it's more emulation than running in a new engine?\n\nRegardless, I think the game still holds up very well.  The ultra compressed audio triggers my nostalgia in a good way and plus the dialogue is delivered expertly.\n\nOld Doom games had a certain feel that is still captured in this enhancement.","December 15, 2014","true","2.5"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

It added story, stealth and RPG elements to a genre that, at the time, these elements were new to.\n\nThat said, after playing through it again, I realize that only the early parts of the game (set around the hub of a town occupied by the Order) really stuck in my memory all that clearly. There is a good reason for this: the further you get into the game, the less significant the elements I mentioned earlier which make the game unique really have any effect. By the end, it's just navigating maze-like levels looking for the right switch, mowing down masses of enemies that cross your path with your impressive aresenal of weapons. In other words, it gradually devolves into every other shooter of its time.\n\nAnother issue I have is just how little variety there is. All the enemies - save one type - are either acolytes or robots. Most of the settings are either medieval-style castles or technological settings that could have been pulled out of a contemporary Star Wars game. There's a bit where you first leave town and find yourself in the outskirts, where it looks like you'll get a new kind of outdoor setting.\n\nI still enjoyed playing this game, and played it all the way until the end. But honestly, if you aren't someone who played it back in the day and wants to rekindle memories or whatever, I don't really see the point in playing this. It might be an interesting curiosity to see an extremely early example of an FPS incorporating these elements from other genres, I suppose, but you might find your interest waning the further in you get.","March 18, 2015","false","15.2"," 20 of 41 people (49%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","49","20","41","2","2"

Sure, nowadays it's not uncommon for FPS games to have a branching story, an inventory and conversation with NPCs, but it's pretty impressive how Strife had all that in 1996 and on the DOOM engine. And while it definately shows it's age, it's still fun and well worth the money.\n\nPros:\n+The game looks really good, easily one of the best looking oldschool FPS games I've played\n+The Veteran edition is a really good modern update to the game and there's also the option of playing the game as it was in 1996, if you're some sort of purist\n+Soundtrack is surprisingly good\n+Weapons are cool and fun to use\n+You can increase your accuracy with guns, melee damage and health\n+You can buy ammo, health, armor and weapons\n\nCons:\n-You will often get lost and have no idea what to do, even with the minimap indicators, so a guide is recommended.\n-Enemies feel really cheap at times, being able to snipe you from the other side of the room\n-There is a stealth element of sorts, but it's really bare bones and not really worth the hassle most of the time\n\nPersonal gripes\n-I don't know if other people have this problem, but I had some issues firing with the Mauler. It seems to work at random.\n-You can only change game settings before starting a game, and not during. Not a deal breaker, but still weird.\n\nDespite a few shortcomings here and there, I recommend trying out Strife if you're a fan of oldschool FPS games.","September 26, 2015","true","7.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kerean/recommended/317040/","kerean","ウジ CARRiON 死神","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kerean/","34 products in account","Deus Ex did it better.\nStrife is an FPS with light RPG elements. The meat of the game consists of shooting enemies and switch/key hunting. You also talk to various people and carry an inventory to stash items & gold to buy weapons, armor, and health. Occasionally you can ask these vendors to improve your health and your aim for gold, which also affects your strength with your only melee weapon.\n\nStrife's world is hub based, it's all one very big level connected together. Unlike shooters before it Strife's level progression is closer to what we'd see in only a few short years become the standard in FPS in games like Half-Life. My first major gripe is actually the level design itself. In the early portion of the game the level design is decent. There is good use of colors, textures and there is a general sense of place; unlike the maze or abstract design of games prior. However the more you play Strife the more the game's level design quickly starts to become boring, tedious and uninspired in a lot of places. Lots of maze like halls, boring environments with lazy texturing, and lot of grey, brown, and puke green everywhere you look.\n\nThere is also a general lack of conveyance in these levels. Lots of switch hunting, and trying to figure out what these switches did exactly. I got lost sometimes for upwards of 30 minutes. It just all starts to blend together and look the same after running around it for a while and it got on my nerves quickly. The little towns in between missions and the first town you start in are some of the only areas in the game that feel colorful and full of life. It also doesn't help that all of the enemies are generic and uninspired both in their look and their behavior. Generic goons in grey/brown armor & generic grey robots. None of the enemies are fun to fight, and most of them don't have any interesting attacks or quirks about them. The bland enemies start to blend in with the bland environments and it quickly makes for bland gameplay that gets old fast.\n\nYour weapon selection is decent at best. You have some weapons, like the assault rifle which feel and function fine enough. Then you have one of the weakest rocket launchers I've ever used in an FPS game.  The grenade launcher does good damage, but it can be hard to aim and often it will bounce off the edge of a wall and come back towards you. The flamethrower is one of the lamest weapons in the game due to its abysmal range, and one of the worst flamethrowers I've seen in a game. The weapons flip flop between being almost useless, to being barely passable, and ALL of them feel weaker than they should be. I also found the story based weapon, the 'Sigil', to be an absolute pain in the ♥♥♥ to use. In the game there are certain bosses that can only be hurt with this weapon, but the catch is it uses your health as its ammo. Not only is it a pain trying to get this weapon to hit your target no matter how good your aim is, but it can create some unfortunate situations with bosses where you're stuck with low health and no health items rendering it unusable and forcing you to backtrack for health.\n\nThere are a few useful items available to you in Strife, like an accuracy increaser, partial invisibility, a beacon to call in rebels to fight alongside you, as well as various health and armor pickups that you can use at your will. You'll also be requested to pick up and sometimes even drop story items in certain areas. I had mentioned Strife's dialogue system earlier, there are a small number of times where you will be given a choice that can affect the outcome of the game, and unless you play through multiple times, playing once will not allow you to see everything. However most of the choices don't do anything, and some can cause the player unseen deaths which I feel is just a big "♥♥♥♥ you" to anybody playing for the first time.\n\nThe sound design I'd describe as mediocre at best. Every single weapon sounds wimpy, explosions lack punch and bass, and the idle sounds everybody makes was enough to drive me up the wall due to how quickly they loop. It all just starts mixing together in a never-ending orgy of annoying sound pollution and I was tempted to turn my sound off a few times just to kill the noise. The voice acting in Strife is also a mixed bag. Some of it sounds almost professional, and gives the story the sense of urgency it needs, while other times it can be downright cartoony. Adding in this odd mix of humor in the otherwise hopeless world Strife presents to you. The music in Strife keeps up with the game's tradition of sounding lazy and phoned in. Besides a few tracks, like the title screen's, all of the music in Strife is completely forgettable and is something I could hammer out in 30 seconds flat myself. Generic drum beat patterns are all I remember of Strife's music, and that is a major disappointment.\n\nSo, that leaves us with the story of Strife. A comet strikes Earth and starts to spread a virus causing many to go insane and hear the voice of a god called 'The Entity'. These people create what is called 'The Order' and take over the world, killing every women and child and forcing men to become slaves. A resistance team is formed underground called 'The Front', and while they have some small victories they are ultimately kept back from doing any real damage by The Order's technological advancements. So you play a wandering mercenary, led to the town you start the game in seeking to join The Front. you team up with them and start taking out strategic areas of importance to The Order and take their land inch by inch. I feel like for 1996, the story to Strife is a great revenge setup and the game tells it to you rather decently throughout as you play and listen to everyone's dialogue. When you take an important area you actually see the rebels there guarding it now, which is a nice touch and gives a feeling of progression for your efforts. On top of some good voice acting you can actually get somewhat invested in this game's plot.\n\nOverall, sad as it is to say however, I find Stife to be extremely flawed. Strife went under the radar upon its release and it wasn't really until certain DOOM source ports finally added support for it that I'd say people even really bothered to acknowledge it much, and honestly I can see why. There are three endings to Strife, but even then the level design across the board is rather boring, the combat is flavorless, the sound design is annoying and music design feeling uninpisred & lazy, overall just makes for a mediocre gameplay experience.\n\nFor these reasons, I didn't find myself enjoying Strife. So much so that when I got the bad ending I was perfectly happy with it just because the game was finally over. I can't recommend this one, especially not before I recommend something that came out and did this formula of FPS mixed with RPG elements better like the System Shock games and of course, Deus Ex.\n\n(*NOTE: I want to quickly touch on the fact that this game is not just dumped on DOSBox; but actually runs on its own custom and specially made port running natively on Windows. Getting rid of the DOS-isms while also adding some nice modern gameplay and graphic eye candy choices in the menu, all optional. The port, and this gesture, are welcomed and appreciated greatly! I'm getting quite tired of seeing these older games simply dumped in DOSBox and asking us for $10 to $15. So, to the people behind this source port itself, thank you! It *IS* appreciated and I want to see this done much more often!)","April 30","false","18.9"," 3 of 15 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","3","15","0","1"

Placing you into a medieval dystopian setting, you are to use crossbows, missile launchers and machine guns to kill soldiers in metal armor. These medieval soldiers fire back at you with, get this, machine guns. You'll run across space blobs and robotic spiders, too. Head on down to "Ye Ol' Weapons Shop" to purchase crossbows and machine gun rounds, or try the armor store next door to buy metal armor so you too can make absolutely no sense, just like your enemies and surroundings.\n\nThis game isn't good by any rules today. I thought Wolfenstein was alright, and the old Duke Nukems were pretty good too. This game was just a failure in an attempt to put FPS into RPG elements. The RPG elements consist of randomly placed NPCs who give you incredibly vague (at least early on) quests. It's very easy to kill someone who could give you a huge quest if you don't talk to them first. On many characters, there are no graphics rendering them different than any other peasant, which means you will have to literally speak to every character on the map in order to find quests properly without a guide.\n\nWhen you speak to these people, a pretty nice cartoon visual of their face will pop up, and then you will hear the voice acting. Oh god, the voice acting made me want to continue playing this game with how laughable it was. You'll walk through medieval times wielding your machine gun, and come upon a peasant with a brooklyn accent who's telling you to get to work before the guards shoot ya.\n\nTL;DR - This game was revolutionary as the first FPS RPG, but revolutionary does not usually go hand-in-hand with good.  This game has poor quests, poor voice actors, and a clunky feel that makes it annoying. After a few hours you might get used to it and if you're a sucker for games reminiscent of something out of 3D Realms, you'll probably enjoy some of it, and appreciate the elements that it paved for games like Deus Ex.","May 8, 2015","false","0.9"," 5 of 44 people (11%) found this review helpful","11","5","44","0","0"

It's a shame, because it's not only a very good game, it was downright revolutionary.\n\nIt was one of the first shooters to actually have an actual story in the game, instead of being just a mindless slaughterfest, before Half-Life made story in shooters normal. And Strife's plot is actually quite good, at least for its time. The story of the order and its underlying secrets is not really anything special, but it's interesting and, along with the gameplay, can keep you motivated for quite some time. It also uses a twist that would look rather bad or out-of-place in many other games, but works here very well and is foreshadowed enough. On the other hand, the plot can also get confusing and it's not always what exactly happened. It feels like the devs didn't think out the story quite as well, as they should have.\n\nThe characters are... serviceable. Non gets much screentime and development and they only exist to drive the plot forward. The most interesting one is your invisible companion Blackbird, who is quite chatty and lets out many entertaining comments, that sometimes skirt the fourth wall.\n\nAs with any old FPS, the gameplay is the most important part and even Strife is no exception. And as with any old FPS, it's no walk in the park. The enemies take away your health pretty quickly and if you have no healing items (or turned auto-heal off), you can find yourself dead very quickly. On the other hand, healing items are pretty plentiful, so the game isn't too harsh. At least on low-mid difficulties.\n\nThere are also light stealth elements, for which you have two "silent" weapons. Very light, though, since it's impossible to finish any area without combat (with on possible exception). For the most part, the purpose is solely to thin out the enemy ranks before the proper fight starts. Other enemies don't care if their companions die near them, expect when they are very close, so that works very well.\n\nAt first, it might look like the game is pretty free, not exactly open-world, but possibly non-linear. This is not the case, though. There is not much you can do aside from your current objectives and attempting to deviate from it can potentially make the game unwinnable (although the Veteran Edition makes it more fair in that regard). There is only one time where you can make a choice that affects the story, but even then there is clearly a "good" and a "bad" choice.\n\nThere are three endings. Two depend on the aforementioned choice, the last on whether you die in the final battle.\n\nThere are a good amount of weapons in the game and everyone is quite useful in their own right. Two weapons have alternative ammo and another one has an alternative fire mode, effectively increasing the amount of weapons. Also, one is modular and fires differently, depending on how many pieces you have. However, it also uses your health as ammo, so it's use is limited (mostly to enemies that can only be hurt by it).\n\nThe presentation is pretty much what one would expect from a 90's shooter in the Doom engine. It's 2.D, 3D but with 2D sprites for characters, items, decorations and pretty much everything that isn't the map itself and very pixelated. The music is MIDI only, which is a rather mixed thing. The songs itself are good, though. Important (and a few not so important) NPCs are presented with big portraits in a comic style, which are pretty well-done. They are also voiced, which is a mixed bag. Generally, the voice acting isn't very good, but the way it tends to be overdone and hammy is actually pretty entertaining. The best one is the aforementioned Blackbird, who has a pretty pleasing voice. Which is good, because you'll hear it the entire time.\n\nThe Veteran Edition improves the visuals with widescreen support and additional effects. Especially Bloom enhances the graphics a lot and makes it kinda hard to go back to "vanilla" Strife.\n\nI can recommend this game to everyone who likes first-person shooters, especially old ones.

Besides a few new maps, the Veteran Edition doesn't add a whole lot to what you get from the port in terms of gameplay.  It also throws in achievements, trading cards, and a couple of new in-game things (Blackbird chiding the player upon death or quiting; three collectible artifacts).\n\nStrife is an old-school shooter; it's built on the Doom engine.  It's not a game that holds your hand, though it doesn't throw you out on the street, either.  Several levels are very maze-like and can give inexperienced players problems.  Also, it's not always clear whether it's a good idea to head to an optional area once it's available or progress in the main story first.  I haven't tested it, but it's possible to render the game unwinnable if certain missions are done in the wrong order (I do know that the Veteran Edition removes one specific way of making it unwinnable).\n\nThe levels are interconnected; with very few exceptions, it's possible to revisit every place you've been whenever you want.  Teleporters make travel a bit easier.\n\nThe weapons in the game have a nice variety, though the electric bolts are pretty much completely worthless.  It's also quite easy to play through the game and never pick up the Mauler.  In my three playthroughs, I only grabbed it once. It's available in two or three places.\n\nThe story is strong, with maybe two-dozen voiced characters.  However, the pacing is a bit odd.  Without giving anything away, this game ends rather abruptly.  After accomplishing a key task, you stroll into a structure which you didn't know existed before, fight through a couple of rooms of enemies, confront the final boss, and that's it.  The time between the penultimate task and the boss is five to ten minutes.\n\nIf playing on harder difficulties, this game can be unforgiving.  It's not that the enemies are mercilessly hard (they're tough, but with only a couple exceptions are not overpowered); rather, it's that the health and ammo which you depend upon are available inconsistently.  It's very easy to find yourself low on supplies and in a tough spot.  Sometimes they're scarce; sometimes there's more than you can carry, forcing you to leave them behind.  You could theoretically backtrack and pick them up again when you need them.\n\nStrife is a rare example of an FPS/RPG hybrid.  The aforementioned voiced characters are a big part of it.  You can choose text responses in dialogue.  You don't make too many plot altering decisions, though several of them affect what order you perform your tasks.  It's also possible to miss large portions of the game, either through decisions or just not going to certain places.\n\nOverall, Strife is a very good game.  It has challenge and charm.  If you like old shooters, play this one.","April 2, 2015","true","37.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's fast-paced, the limited RPG mechanics largely staying out of the way, and pretty brutal at times. Also, it's surprisingly open for such an old FPS, especially one built in the Doom engine - anywhere you go, with very few exceptions, you can go back to at any time. You'll want to, considering how much they put in to explore.\n\nDon't worry about the engine feeling old, either. This port is very well done, it feels modern. It doesn't have all the bells and whistles that, say, GZDoom has - but it's also easier to handle, doesn't allow you to do things that would break the game, and has a few very welcome additions. Directional damage indicators and different crosshairs for each weapon help in combat, and objective markers are a blessing on some of the more labyrinthine areas. The options menu is comprehensive, although it does have one problem in that it doesn't actually tell you what your FOV is currently set to.\n\nThis is a great re-release of a great old shooter.

I remember spending many hours/days playing when I was 10 or so, saying that I did spend half the time running round testing every wall for secrets...\n\nErm..\nI don't like the electric bolts on the crossbow still.\n\nOh yeah. Why didn't it have multiplayer when I was young? We had 3 PCs linked up to play (among others) Doom1/2, and Heretic (Buy it. Crossbow chickens.), this would have been an amazing addition to our Son Vs Son Vs Dad massacre sessions.\n\nPros.\nAwesome storyline.\nSexy, wisecracking, and foulmouthed (She is NAUGHTY! Words your mother would love to hear from a computer game) helper, adding to the complete audio for all important NPCs. (I think I know why my dad remembers it now)\nGreat graphics for a retro game.\nThe music is funky.\nFlawless gameplay. I've had some issues with remakes of older games, but Strife was perfect at all times. (Even with what seemed like a million guards going crazy at once!)\nSidequests, inventory management and the option to try and avoid murdering NPCs all add to the games overall quality.\nIt still lasts longer than Gears of War.\n\nBloodbath difficulty is not for girls. And if attempted, for gods sake don't do the chalice quest. That's 10 minutes of terror right there!\n\nDifficult to rate the game, as the nostalgia value alone would make it 11/10.\n\nI'll just say, for £7, you really can't go wrong. And not buying it would mean you'd be letting Blackbird down, and you really don't want to do that, right?","September 22, 2015","true","17.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Rather than walking the path of the classic DOOM clone, Strife aims for a different angle and perspective on the FPS genre, adding NPC interactions and a variety of different approaches to quests and areas.\n\nThis particular version, in addition to what the game has to offer, features improved graphics and controls (including controller support) but stays true to the original title (except for a number of bugs who have been fixed) and even offers the chance to play the "classic" version of the game.\n\nAll in all, it's well worth its price (getting it in a bundle is a bounty) and will certainly prove to be entertaining for quite a few hours worth of gameplay. In addition, it's one of the few examples of a "revamped" game that doesn't lose a bit of its dignity or identity, but gets a bit of makeup on and a pat on the back instead: that's about all a good game needs to be back on tracks.","May 17, 2015","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, there was one particular game that always stuck with me: Strife. The last commercial release to use the Doom engine, Strife mystified me with gameplay elements I had personally never seen before. Before Strife, everything had been a boomfest: Kiloblaster. Death Rally. Realms of Chaos. Doom, Heretic, Quake. All action, no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Not that that was ever a bad thing. Where doom set a space marine against demon hordes and Quake against lovecraftian horrors, Strife took a different route, blending a medieval world of tunics, crossbows and stone castles with an invading dark future of computers, killer cyborgs and energy rifles. You are a mercenary, just arrived to the small town of Tarnhill, caught in a struggle for power between the oppressive, fanatical Order and the resistance fighters of the Front- a recipe for violence, and to be sure, Strife does not shirk on big, tough fights against multiple foes, with the fast player movement and diverse range of weapons you'd expect from a 90s FPS. But Strife also had something different from other id tech games: Dialogue. It had characters with full voice-acting, a story of betrayal and ancient conspiracy, a sultry-voiced lady with a radio guiding you on your way, a hub-level system that let you revisit previous areas (I didn't play Hexen until years after the fact), hand-drawn portraits and cutscenes, an inventory system a la Heretic, shops, two branching story routes and three endings, and even a rudimentary leveling system. I did not know it at the time, and even then, I had only played the demo, but Strife was the beginning of a lifelong love of the FPS/RPG hybrid. It may have been the first RPG I ever played period- or least the first one I enjoyed (I'm looking at you, Lands of Lore.) Sadly, the studio that created Strife  closed, the source code was lost, and game was entirely out of print for almost 20 years, an unjust fate for such a gem. However, late in 2014, this "Veteran" edition of the game was released, and at last I was given a chance to experience Strife as it had been intended, and with yet more to offer. I would call this version the definitive edition- not only is the original game restored in its entirety, but the demo version is included as a seperate episode (with deferring dialogue and character placement from the final version), the multiplayer mode cut from the original release has been included, and there is an entire extra secret level, designed by a guy who created one of the reverse-engineered source ports and was instrumental in the release of this version. Also present are three "talisman" items, cut from the original release, that if gathered grant the player beserker power comparable to the powerup in Doom, turning your feeble punch-dagger into a weapon capable of destroying Inquisitors, a rare, powerful enemy that serves as a miniboss, in one or two punches. Also mercifully included are objective indicators on your map, which will certainly be a mercy to any first-time Strife players, as some of the later areas of the game are as convuluted as any Doom level. If you ever thought Doom and its derivitves were lacking a certain something, that maybe you wanted a more cinematic exprience but with that same fast, frenetic combat, then Strife might be what you're looking for. Just remember... Trust No One.","October 12, 2015","true","10.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The RPG part is kind of over stated- it's just a health/accuracy increase after each mission (more or less) and an ammo capacity upgrade if you have gold. Has voiced characters and an actual story which is something different for Doom style games.\n\nThere are a couple of engine limitations such as aiming vs. actual trajectory when trying to shoot at things close and high above and player hitbox is seemingly huge when explosions occur.\n\nSome levels are a bit of a drag (i.e. the sewers...) and with only the occasional quest marker it can be a lengthy exercise to finish a level.\n\nAmmo is scarce mid level which forces you to think about how to use weapons effectively. With a fun story and fairly unique levels, Strife manages to be an enjoyable look back at gaming in the early 90's.","December 19, 2014","true","11.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can even set it to fm-midi mode so that it sounds like the old one did in DOS years ago.  Great game, using the old DooM engine (this possibly uses zdoom bases? - don't quote me on that).   Gives a little bit of character progression with increasing health and increasing ammo capacities and such.  New weapons now and then.  Nothing like today's games, but you can definitely tell this was a game changer, although a bit un-noticed by many - due to a lack of good marketing to really get the game out there.  Totally awesome, and in today's time you don't have to worry about deleting the voices.wad file to save 30mb (if you do, no one will ever speak to you again).   Really a great game if you have the urge to play all the games of the Dos Doom days.  Just make sure you have atleast 8mb of ram to run this on your PC and you should be fine :)\n\n+lots of secrets, weapons different than DooM weapons for something fresh, sprawling hexen-like "hub" level-structure.\n+voices - the characters TALK!, No loading times, Makes you USE your brain to think about decisions or where to go.\n-OK, it *CAN* be confusing where to go sometimes, but there IS a map and it USUALLY tells you the right place to go, but be warned, make a back up save before you enter 'the sewers' as they can be CONFUSING and you could DIE down there...  but once you get the heck out of there, it's way fun again.  Not as confusing as Dark Forces sewers.... but close!\n\nBut seriously, if you want a fun Doom-Engine game from the 90s, this is one of them, and especially when on-sale it's a true gem for the price.
