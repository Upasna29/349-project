At first I was a bit worried that another indie RTS was being pushed out on Steam as, well I know I can speak for most of the people looking at this game, we've been burnt out and screwed over by developers that spend a whopping two months and call it a game then charge an arm and a leg... Well let me be the first one to tell you that this isn't one of those games at all!\n\nDear lord if you want edge of your seat gameplay, better than normal base building, an interesting campaign with hopes for the future, and units that are wonderfully designed and almost perfectly customizable this game is for you! Campaign plops you down in an interesting mix of a colonization story gone wrong. I won't spoil anything but goodness that's one fine story I'm still crawling through. Loading times? Forget about em! This game has none and in the places where it does have them it's a whole whopping two second wait at the most (might be a little longer for some older computer rigs; not sure but it won't take you long!)\n\nThings that really stick out for this game in my opinion? Probably the graphics and music. You can see the screenshots and while I was skeptical at first that they were just glorified photoshopped images I can gladly say that is not the case at all. The game is literally that beautiful and the music that plays just bolsters the overwhelming beauty of this game. If you have the money for it I would gladly tell you to buy this one! You will not be upset with your purchase at all.\n\nBelieve you/me friend, I'm tired of getting the short end of the stick because I love RTS games and will stand by this game as long as it continues to be worked on. Thanks Dark for rekindling my trust in indie RTS games.","March 31, 2014","true","5.7"," 312 of 394 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","312","394","2","12"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jewbobicus/recommended/265120/","jewbobicus","Steve the Dota Player","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jewbobicus/","161 products in account","Simply put, this game is awful to actually play. If that's all you need from a review, you can stop here. If you want to know WHY this game is awful, keep reading.\n\n1. Storyline\nThe story is pretty uninspired. It's not completely terrible, but it's nothing you haven't seen before. Maybe it gets better, but I couldn't get too far due to numerous frustrations before I dropped the game. The voice acting is at best, average. WIth woodenly delivered lines, and dialogue that could have been written by a chat-bot.\n\n2. Gameplay\nThis is the main problem. An average to below average plot/voice acting can often be made up for in gameplay. Unfortunately these developers seem to have forgotten how RTS' work.\n\nProblem 1: The perspective and selection of units.\nThe angle of the game, and the awful awful unit boxes make it very difficult to get all your units, or select individual units, or really do basic things quickly and efficiently. Did you miss on of your units when trying to select it? Well screw you player! Because now you have NOTHING selected. Isn't that great? There are several abilities in the game that you are to use on a singular unit. This is difficult and can cause issues. Anyone who is used to a well made RTS, and want's to micro and control army effectively is in for a bad time. This however, is not the only contributor to that bad time.\n\nProblem 2: The (lack of) pathfinding\nYou know when you play a game, and sometimes your unit happens to go a weird way around the map to the location you sent it to? Usually doesn't happen that often, and usually isn't a big deal. That's not the case In Meridian: forgotten mechanics. Do you want to move somewhere specific? They will eventually get there. Not together, not in a timely manner, but eventually. Just hope there are no enemies to fight.\n\nWhat happens when there are enemies? Well I'm glad you asked! See, if you run in to an enemy, while moving around the map, chances are everyone in your dumb as hell army has separated into squads of 1. Thankfully, the enemy AI will just put them out of their misery. Now, it is possible you'll actually have your army together and want to attack. One of the basic moves in an RTS is to Attack move. In almost every RTS ever made, as soon as an enemy is in sight and range, the guns start blazing. In "Meridian: What LSD trip made us think we knew how to make a game", you will find, at almost every occasion, your units running directly at the enemy without firing. Without realizing that they are NOT some sort of kamikaze unit. Without deigning to obey your commands in a remotely satisfactory manner.\n\nThanks to these amazing mechanics, you often need to retreat to try to herd your dumb struck army in to a semblance of a group so you can actually play the game. In most RTS' retreat is a viable strategy. In "Meridian: Oh my GOD does anyone know how to walk?" this is nigh impossible. Retreating involves attempting to move away from the enemy. In the unlikely event your units actually manage to walk away from the enemy, you will find them immediately attempting to engage the enemy. The worst part is, the terrible pathing and AI means that they will have half trying to get back somewhere, half who are going the other way and get stuck on eachother, and no one actually firing on the enemy OR retreating. The target acquisition range is just absolutely nuts. It doesn't make sense. I've had units react to hostiles WHO WEREN"T VISIBLE YET. I'm pretty sure Chewbacca lives on Endor, because it just doesn't, make, sense.\n\nBonus problem:\nHotkeys. I get having your own hotkeys for your game so you can be "different" so all the cool kids will like you. But changing fundamentals like moving the hold position command from 'H' to 'E' is just plain stupid. There's many similar changes in this game. "Meridian: who even needs hotkeys anyway" decided to reinvent their hotkeys from the refined version most games have settled with, to a new pile of crap that no one wants to be in.\n\n3. Graphics\nThis is the only area where Meridian: Really Shiny gets any sort of credit. I'm not saying it's a visually stunning masterpiece. But it is nice. It's vibrant. Also really shiny. Nothing to write home about, but nothing particularly bad either.\n\nFinal Thoughts: There are lots of RTS games out there. There is a reason that Command and Conquer, Warcraft 1, 2 AND 3, Starcraft 1 AND 2 are all timeless classics. There is a reason that most RTS games have similar if not identical base mechanics to each other. It's because they WORK, and they work WELL. They allow strategy, micro and macro. Meridian: Barely a functional game decided that's not necessary in their RTS. They wanted to be different, to be cool, instead everyone should be making fun of them and ignoring them.","March 11, 2015","false","6.3"," 141 of 162 people (87%) found this review helpful 45 people found this review funny","87","141","162","45","0"

Just as everything seems that it’s going good and you prepare to leave the planet when an unknown distress call is intercepted on the surface. Its origin unknown you set to find out what the cause of the message was. However, everything falls to panic when a mysterious enemy begins an assault on you while you are scouting a power plant on the surface. Who is this enemy and what do they want?\n(This is purely based on the first mission alone to avoid spoilers as much as possible.)\nGameplay //\nMeridian gives you a Command & Conquer play style with the unit control of earth 2160. This comes together rather well however at points unit pathing can be a problem as it is hard to define what is and isn’t clickable terrain.\n\nThe base building is satisfying and refreshing to the RTS genre with the original style of building on a grid layout similar to StarCraft. This makes both building your base and navigating it enjoyable and simple.\nThe general combat of the game seems pretty simple at first. Just chuck units at each other and see who wins. However the game actually has unit customization and each unit aside from the foot solider can have a weapon set such as the auto-cannon or laser.\nThis allows units to be countered by weaknesses and really makes you think if you should engage the enemy or not.\n\nThe only problem I have with the overall gameplay is that there needs to be some more units. However this is a WIP so more should come hopefully!\nSound //\nThe sound assets for the game are surprisingly good and flow well with the overall experience of the game. Voice acting is realisc and flows well with the game. It’s really hard to believe that one guy managed to make the game.\nFinal verdict //\nFor me, Meridian gave back a good feel of the RTS genre to me and has given me already more hours than I will typically play a game for.\nOverall I give the game a 7/10 in its current state, this may go up or down in future versions of the game.\nThe main benefits of the game are:\nUnit Customization –\nGood base building –\nStory –\nThe downsides are:\nRange of units –\nUnnecessary points in the story such as the tower defence segment.\n\n\nThanks for reading my review!\nSorry for any spelling or Grammar errors!\nAlso check out the video version of this review!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wEZhmNh8Qk","April 2, 2014","true","6.0"," 116 of 152 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","116","152","0","1"

Beware that  the variety of units, and some features of gameplay are very simplistic, so you will likely need to adjust to the limitations of such a basic system.\n\nHints:\nIn the campaign, there is often an easy win condition. For example, rush to build a line of turrets at a bottle-neck; or, look for some unguarded enemy power stations; or, rescue the group of neutral units to get a bigger army.\nThe simulation maps are great ways to pick up a few handy hints on gameplay.\n\nA bit of a rant about the things that frustrated me about this game:\nKudos to this lone developer for making what is essentially the basis for a great game. Unfortunately, the developer made a few gameplay decisions which entirely spoilt this game for me, especially since this is a strategy game. Namely:\ncannot attack while moving (can't even begin to list the strategic consequences of this)\ntoo few micromanagement options (such as no patrol option, no defend-this-building button, no action/movement queuing)\nUnits sometimes wouldn't auto-acquire enemies that came in range.\n"attack towards" would first move my units forwards a few meters before attacking anything\ntoo few units and buildings (exaggerates hard counters, eg 2 rocket-launcher light tanks beats a whole army of troopers. What's worse is that because there are so few unit types theres a very good chance that this would happen. You end up needing to build 2 of everything which is just fiddly and annoying)\nFinally, I stopped playing this game after a Campaign map where the enemy has somehow amassed an army of around 100 units, and had 6 unit-producing buildings surrounded by turrets. It was an impenetrable wall of units that just kept regenerating.An example of how a fight would play out:\nYou have a squadron of aerial fighters with high-ranged armor-piercing weapons. The enemy has a rag-tag mix of every conceivable vehicle/infanty and weapon variant. In all likelihood you'll win this one. However, you need to retreat in order to prevent the AI from focus firing your units down. You spend a few seconds moving away (taking damage the whole time and unable to damage them while doing so) they finally catch up, but their high-range tanks reached you first and they start shooting (out of field of vision range) you use the attack-towards command to save the few seconds it takes to manually target them once they come into your view. Your units fly a bit farther than was necessary due to ♥♥♥♥♥♥ auto targetting; putting  their whole army in range of yours. Very soon your whole army is getting flanked and shot down one-by-one with no focus fire. You cannot do the retreat strategy because that means more time taking damaging whilst dealing no damage. You decide to manually focus fire. That's all good an fine, but you're losing damage efficiency in the seconds between then your manual target dies and when you manually target the next enemy. Don't even think about using the attack-towards function to lessen this down time, though, because we've already established that it's not viable.  .. in a last desperate attempt to win the fight you retreat slightly and attack-towards just in front of where the remaining enemy army will emerge. This time, a close-ranged scouting vehicle comes into sight on its own (slightly ahead of the rest of their army) your unit's auto-acquire this target; quickly killing it before any other enemies come into sight. You move a few meters forwards; (unbeknowst to you) you reach the spot where you'd originally anticipated they would appear... HOWEVER! The attack-towards command has finished executing. Now, due to ♥♥♥♥♥♥ auto-targetting your units dont even attack the rest of the enemy army as it comes into sight. You get picked off in the following few seconds. You escape with 3 units left on 5% health each. You use AoE heal, but somehow despite your units being within the displayed grid only one of them gets healed at all.","December 9, 2014","true","23.1"," 51 of 62 people (82%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","82","51","62","7","3"

Is it StarCraft II??...well, no.\n\nBut this game puts a few interesting spins on the RTS formula that make it really interesting and fun to play. Instead of producing a standard unit and upgrading offense/defense from an approriate facility (this game has this feature aswell for unit specific upgrades), any weapon upgrades you research for your units can ONLY be applied when they are created. For example, you can Research upgraded cannons, rockets, lasers, railguns etc. that are purchased with the creation of your new unit (varried costs). Cannons are strong vs infantry, Rockets apply area damage, Lasers have increased range and Railguns jump to nearby units.\n\nAlso, Commander abilities add alot to gameplay (a SC2 comparison would be hero powers, but they are only usable when you have a hero and only with hero in range). Meridian's 'Commander' abilities are usable anytime and anywhere on the map not affected by fog of war. These powers do come at a cost in the form of an regenerative energy bar and vary from Direct Damage to Healing to Increased build/production rates. These abilities are trained with points you acquire when you level up.\n\nNo Multiplayer (yet at least), some pathing issues and at times questionable voice acting are the only minor concerns with this title.\n\nNOTE: This game was for the most part made by ONE MAN in 2 years.

Your actions will be remembered and change the way things go for you.\n\nNew mechanics are introduced throughout the campaign but doesn't forget about being an RTS when that is happening.\n\nUnits are limited but instead you get to select the weapons for each unit you train, allowing you to use the unit type and weapon most suited for your situation.\n\nYou can also try out several small challenges during the campaign to see how weel you can use each of the units.\n\nThere is NO multi-player (Story and Skirmish only - up to 3 AI) so do not buy if that is all you are interested in.\n\nThere is only ONE faction (Human) but the weapon customisation allows for up to 100 differnt unit to be created.\n\nThe map editor and scripting tool used to make the campaign is available with the game; meaning anyone can create anything seen during the game as well as modify existing units, buildings and soon weapons.\nCustom maps can be shared on Steam Workshop so you can make your own content for others or try theirs out giving you endless free content.\nIt's Easy to use and has a 50 page PDF document to help.\n\nMeridian: New World also has a really nice sound track that fits well.\n\nThere are 75 Achievements to work towards if you want give yourself more challenges.\n\nDeveloper is active in the forums, listens to all suggestions and has a good record for fixing technical issues for people individually.\nCommunity shared maps will continue to provide more and new game play too.\n\n\nTo see the game in action here's a video showing the campaign being played through (No commentary)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akA-wSg6SXk","July 12, 2014","true","133.7"," 42 of 53 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","42","53","0","0"

I can't send units from one part of the map to another and depend on them to get there in one piece, because they will move to that spot without fighting back against attacks on their way there. Even in Command and Conquer, units would shoot back when being attacked, but these units just march to their deaths and don't do anything to try and prevent it.\n\n2. Dumb units. Select a unit or units to attack and enemy and will they open fire once within range? Not always. Sometimes they'll walk past the enemy to shoot from one particualr side. Why would they insist on shooting from the right rather from the left even though the left is of equal distance from the enemy and doesn't expose them to enemy fire like the right side does? Who knows, death wish?\n\nSome odd programming choices here.

This game is really simple, but in a good way. Almost no learning curve to the basics of this game. It reminds me of Command and Conquer and the first Starcraft put together.\n\nPros:\n*Even with only about 8 (I count the fighter and heavy fighter as one) units total, it's diverse.\n-3 Units (infantry and bomber) only have 1 available weapon.\n-1 Unit has 4 (Fighter/Heavy Fighter) weapon choices\n-4 Units have 5 (Light/Heavy Vehicles) Choices\n-(I count tier 1 and 2 weapons as one because the upgrade replaces the tier 1)\n\n*For an RTS it has a pretty good story to it.\n-In between missions you can walk around your ship and converse with the crew, run training simulations, and read about various parts of the game.\n\n*Optamization\n-As stated in another review, there are virtually no loading times. My rig is a 4 year old gaming laptop and missions and skirmishes load up in less than 5 seconds.\n\n*Fun campaign\n\n*Good graphics\n-The graphics are really good for how smooth it is, even the cutscenes are really good looking.\n\nCons:\n*No way to zoom in or pan the camera.\n-Normally I play supreme commander, so I don't really care about panning the camera, but being unable to zoom in and out can be a minor inconvinience at times.\n\n*Short campaign\n-As fun as it is, it was over too soon, BUT!!! it is only on mission 5 so far. The dev is still adding missions in as the game progresses\n\n*Only one faction\n-I'm not even able to really speculate on whether I feel there would be another faction or not. It's too soon to tell but I don't see why there wouldn't be plans for one.\n\n*A little buggy\n-I had a start up error, but the crash report was very detailed and provided multiple troubleshooting ideas to solve the problem and they worked. This is an early access game, so bugs are to be expected.\n\n*Pathfinding\n-The AI pathfinding cand be really bad at times. I.E. I send a scout to one corner of the map and it cuts through and enemy base on the opposite side of the destination. Still good for the games current stage.\n\nNeutral Points:\n(These are neither good or bad, just some features that some people might like and others may not)\n*Snipers can outrange defense turrets\n*Defense turrets function like the NOD Turrets in C&C 3: Tiberium Wars (There is a central hub that is linked to turrets)\n*A rank up tree (level up, get perks)\n*Halowars Deathmatch style unit cap. You increase your unit cap by building structures.\n\nAll in all I do recommend this game. More so if it is on sale.","May 9, 2014","true","10.8"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","15","21","0","0"

For example: First you have got a small squad of units and you have to walk with them true enemy lines, later in the same mission you will find a lost base and use it for your own aims (base building and such stuff). Later in the same mission you have to defend your base with some turrents. That´s a short tower defense part included in the mission.\n\nThe game combines RTS, RPG and a feeling of retro gaming in memory of C&C.\n\n5 of 5 points from me.\n\n\nYou can get the game right now for 9 Bugs at the Humble Bundle Weekly Bundle ;)","September 19, 2014","true","11.0"," 16 of 25 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","16","25","0","0"

The graphics are on par with many modern RTS titles and the gameplay is, for the most part, slick and elegant. As an RTS, its only pitfall in my opinion is a lack of factions and the ability to have team battles. The game currently lacks multiplayer, but the developer has stated that he plans on adding it in later. The campaign is a very interesting take on the RTS formula with interesting and varied missions that are actually quite challenging. It's a nice throwback to the quality of RTS that we used to see back during their inception, a la C&C and Red Alert.

I just can't, though.\n\nI guess the reason for a larger team instead of one person is to point out little helpful things like... "Don't you think it's really annoying that units will just charge the whole way accross the screen to fight something?"\n\nAnd...  "I understand the medic scouts are fast... but it's just aggravating that they will always run to the front of the battle." In fact, that's most of this game... could have just called it formation commander. Most of it just involves trying to keep healing units from being in the front.\n\nAs for the campaign... it's tedious. It's extremely simple with hard parts that shouldn't be hard at all. At one level you're left with a tower defence portion. This killed the entire game for me. There's not enough of a story to bother spending the time it would take to beat it. You can't even adjust the difficulty... there simply isn't an adjustment. Anyways... at about level 20(of the TD mini game) I just gave up. Positioning units to protect from air attack... and then they just run off all willy nilly.\n\nHey, and in this part... you can't control them... No hold position function.\n\n\nSeriously...

Meridian: New World is trying to be a throwback to the good old days of Westwood and Command and Conquer, and has many good ideas along the way, but it fails on too many levels to be anything but a waste of money. Poor controls, optimization, visuals, voice acting, and a general feeling of shabbiness ruin what may have, at one time, had the potential for an interesting experience.\n\nThere is the germ of good ideas here; you can customize the loadouts of individual units upon construction, which is always neat, and the story is attempting to be that rarest of beasts, a character-driven RTS. You, the player, have a branching tech tree that allows you to perfom actions like healing individual units, disable enemy vehicles, that sort of thing. The problem is, like so many games of a more indie persuasion, the good ideas fail to live up to their potential.\n\nThe customizable loadouts are a good idea, but it's done when you start building your units, meaning that by the time it's done, you may have wanted something different...but too bad! You'll need to build a new one. Compare Dawn of War, which had a fantastic loadout system.\nThe story is uninteresting, poorly translated into english, and with pretty awful voice acting. Normally I wouldn't mind this, but they are clearly trying to use branching, bioware style conversation trees and characterization to drive the plot. Bad voice acting undermines this goal.\nThe controls are slow and stiff, with painfully snail-like camera panning, and the ugly, impractical UI doesn't help. In a good RTS, your units feel alive, and responsive, and you are able to control them with precision and skill. Here, I feel lucky when they are even able to move where I want them to go. And if I wanted to change the controls to fit my needs, I have exactly two options to customize controls; mouse sensitivity and a toggle for "camera panning," a mysterious button with no discenerable effect on gameplay.\n\nThe players ability tree works well though. Kudos for that, though it was at first a little unclear how the energy bar that powers your abilities works. Unfortunately, there is only one faction (something the original Command and Conquer was able to overcome), and so the tech tree is the only source of variety you're going to get.\n\nMoving on, the game is ugly an poorly optimized. It chugged more than games that look far better than this does, and crashes frequently. I know this is part of the early access package, but you have to keep it together if you want players to stick with it until the final release.\n\nFinally, on a less easily described note, the game just feels...shabby. Other early access games have been able to have a feeling of beauty and vibrancy from the very beginning, but this game feels broken on a more fundamental level.\n\nTaken as a whole, Meridian: New World is, quite, quite awful. It is the product of one man's vision, and where for some games that means a new experience, here it is clearly the work of someone in way over their head, trying to match the work of those who are far more skilled. It would take a truly gargantuan effort to make this game worth playing at its final release date, and I just can't see it happening. Take this game as an example of Steam's famously lax quality control. Or better still, don't take the game, and go play your favorite good RTS instead.","April 4, 2014","false","1.6"," 115 of 217 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","115","217","0","12"

Switching to windowed mode, leaves you with a 1024x768 (4:3) window, that cannot be resized to 16:9, and if you force the window to resize (through user32.dll calls) it borks out. In fullscreen, it awkwardly defies the natural resolution of your monitor, and stretches the image. In 2014... really.\n\nThe UI, when typing, is rather unresponsive. Press the keys slowly, for every key to be registered. It's terrible.\n\nThe AI of your own units is dumb as a pile of poop, making micromanagement nigh impossible. Being able to save hurt units is more luck than anything.\n\nSince you can't see what keys you CAN use, I will have to assume that you cannot group units under a hotkey, which is a default must have since 1489 BC, or the more recent saving hotkeys to map positions since 700 AD. Good job, guys.\n\nSince metal is a music genre right up my alley, the combat music suits me.

I don't recall having to choose a difficulty level which kinda sucks.\n\nThey introduce the technology if only you capture it from the enemy which is somewhat annoying. It's like the nation your playing can't develope its own technology instead, they have to steal it.\n\nIf I have to rate it out of 5. I would give it a simple 3/5. Best to get the game when its on sale for less then $5.00","December 29, 2014","true","2.4"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Will this be a waste of money? For a game to have the quality of a Starcraft is really asking a lot (that is whether you have to need to do so). Well, just before the summer sale was over I thought what the heck I’ll give it a go. I’m no expert on game design and graphics and so forth … I’m just a gamer that wants an enjoyable game that’s good value for money. No lagging, crashes and so on (you get the picture). I’ve been branded as full of crap when it comes to games so I see myself as a gamer with high expectations.\nI’ve played Meridian: New World for a bit now and I found no fault in the graphics. The detail to the buildings are good. It would have been nice to be able to zoom in closer since the characters are very small (1920 x 1080). The AI seems to be functioning well on their own. The sound is pretty decent and you have dialog options. The cut scenes was lagging a bit though … nothing serious but it’s there. I’m not an online gamer so I can’t comment on that. It may not have the online capability of bigger titles but this game does not have all that security hassles either and for me that is preferable. The price is by far more reasonable than the bigger titles. You see, you do not have to pay for the attached “prestige”.\nAs I understand it, this game was designed by a single developer. Really? Well, if that is the case I have one thing to say to this person … you’re doing a great job. This is one purchase I will not regret. I got “bang for my buck” (pardon the pun). Do I recommend this game? I found it enjoyable so I have to say for sure! As I read in another review and to quote the person … “buy this game, or I’ll poke you in the eye”. Well, get on with it. Happy gaming.\n","June 30, 2014","true","5.5"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

From what I see, the ideas behind were really good. Each type of weapon had its role on different tech level. Well, really not tech levels but researching weapons and chasiss is like giving you the advantage if the enemy did not predict/react fast enough.\n\nI was really impressed that you made a game by yourself, which is good looking, not too overwhelming (supreme commander such) and simple while not being too simple. I am putting some ideas here that I think makes the game more awesome:\n\n1. More customization aspects! I could see weapons already play a "different unit type role" but some chassis modifier may do the job. For example, Increased movement speed, adding a shield that takes only one hit and regenerate after going out of battle. Don't need to make too complicated through. Less is good xD(but not bald :) ) See impossible creatures, I've played that game and love it especially the army customization but it was never known by all. Anyway, special modifiers do add depths to the game. Would love to see some more vehicle chassis though.\n\n2. Current state it is hard to distinguish one unit type that have different weapons, as the weapons are very insignifant to be seen (other than a whole of chimeras) Maybe: 1.Adding some modifier to the look so it is easier to distinguish the same unit with different weapons, like missile pods added on rocket chimera. 2. Make group selection weapon dependent also. currently when I double click, I select all chimeras(expect for miners) and send them to die. combining with 1, it is more friendly to micromanage during battles.\n\n3. add passive powers. Maybe not that significant as I can see energy plays a important rule in decision making?\n\n4. smoother unit movements! Flocking AI like starcraft did will do the magic! In real life army march in order instead of randomly clamp into each other right? xD Doesnt imply having to set up formations do.(I saw someone mentioned)\n\n5. one more level of difficulty! It is nice to have good ai in current state, but I would love to see overpowering ais that can drive us to adrenline( at least I am not pro gamer on rts :p)\n\nToo bad there was no infantry customization. :) They tend to be underpowered and probably may not able to cope with anything in late game (maybe because I had'nt seen all weapons yet?) I do not want to see just whole army of chimeras clamp into each other xD\n\nI appreciate your work on this game and it do refresh my seeings with rts(no more dead C&C series, boring sequences of some rts and the good but nothing-changed-on-substance starcraft2) This game just need a lot more polish to perfect.\n\nHopes you can finish the game with surprises for us :D Anyway, I love mad cat. ;)","June 28, 2014","true","3.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The\nmusic is very well done, and adds to the highs and lows of the combat and\nstory.  The graphics and the story combine beautifully to create a visual work\nof art.\n\nOne issue I have noted in this game is in the user interface.\nThe map is nicely done, and I had no issue with the moving or management of\ntroops, but there are small problems like having to click on the scene to\nmove individual troops.   There is a level of micromanagement that has been\nintegrated into the system that makes the action of moving troops more\ncomplicated than it needs to be, which becomes more and more of an issue as you\nprogress through higher levels of difficulty.\n\nThe level design is done quite well.  The missions provide small\nvariations with specific goals that breaks up any feeling of repetitive combat.\nWhat hurts this game is the lack of a proper tutorial;  you are just thrown\ninto the action without proper knowledge of the interface.  As the levels get\nlarger, and you have a larger army, you need to have tight control of your troops\nand a workable strategy with how you  progress.  The AI in this game is very\npoor, where sometimes a troop that you tell to hold position will decided to\nattack anyways, making any advanced strategy near impossible as you have to\nbabysit your troops to make sure they don't go off on their own.  It is\nextremely frustrating.\n\nThe game suffers from many minor annoyances;  I go into more detail in\nmy video, but small things like not being able to bind to infantry barracks to\none key, or not being able to build buildings if there is a troop in the way,\nand the continuous swarming of the enemy that doesn't seem to have a unit cap\nwhile you are limited by resources all add up to a not fun experience.  The cost\nof troops to the amount of resources available in the game is unbalanced.\n\nOverall, I can't recommend this game due to the combination of so\nmany small annoyances that all add up to a frustrating experience.

This is the type of game that you've played before in C&C, Star Craft and Earth 2160.  Nothing new going on here.  I got rather bored by mission 3, repeat of all things old.\n\nIf you have the old games, keep with them, will save you some money.  It's not a terrible game, but just nothing to shout about.\n\nThe idea around the game isn't anything special although the players ability tree works well though in the game.  Some of the things that are annoying can be found in other post, formation command being number 1 for me.  Units are disorganised and random, air units fly around eachother on a lateral plane no concept of 3d spacing.  There are only a few units that you're playing with the same ones over and over.\n\nOverall, as above, save your money and get out your old CDs, more enjoyable.

This "game" is the exact reason why.  I just finished the campaign mode, which consisted of about 1/10th of what i imagine the complete game will be (like 3 maps).  I labeled it as "recommended", because it is truly a very-well put together RTS.  It's beautiful, plays extremely well, and a solid buy at $15, that is, it will be when it is COMPLETE.  The problem with early access games, is that they are often abandoned or updates are severely delayed.  I hope that's not the case with Meridian.

You build a power planet and a storage unit.  The enemy attack, your troops all die with 1 of there's possible dying.  By time 2 more troops are built, he has tanks, and a huge army that could not possibly have been built in that time.

SOOOO much potential.\n\nFirst the things I like:\n-Mechs\n-Great customization\n-Good unit variety\n-Research\n-base building\n-novel level ideas, such as the stealth mission\n-Well written (IMO) campaign\n\nUnfortunately, while this game does some things very well, it has a number of what I consider to be major issues:\n\n-Your unit AI is completely braindead. This is what I picture your mech pilots thinking: "Hmmm.... Should I, an autogun mech that cannot damage air targets stay here, at the choke point my commander selected for me when there will be another wave of infantry soon, or should I chase the bomber that I have absolutely no way of damaging and get eaten by it? I think I'll chase the bomber!"\n-Medical units are notably faster than primary fighting units. This does not sound like a con until you have to micromanage a squad of 10 medic units to actually stay BEHIND your frontline so they dont get pulverized and leave your primary force without a way to repair its armor\n-The tower defence mode is very poorly executed. If you make one single mis-move, or even mismanage your resources in the slightest, you will nearly instalose. In addition, if I had wanted to play a TD game, I would have played a TD game.\n\nI feel that this game has a massive amount of potential, but the current issues are, for me at least, completely game breaking. Most notable is the friendly unit AI issues. They will literally chase enemy units half way across the map even if they are not equipped to damage them.\n\nIf during development these issues are patched, I would wholeheartedly recommend this game, but as it stands now, I cannot.","August 21, 2014","false","1.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I have been looking for a similar game like warcraft 2 since they still have not (if ever) make a warcraft 4.\n\nThis game feels like warcraft 2 in every way. Mine resources, build your requires buildings per unit, attack with units, etc. It has a campaign, skirmish missions, custom map editor, and able to download maps from the community. It reminds me of warcraft 2 with a reskin (much better graphics obviously) and change to mech units instead of orcs and humans. There are some small differences, but that is fine. Its not meant to be 100% replica of warcrafts. The pathfinding is exactly what you expect from warcraft 2.\n\nThis caught my eye because it was on sale. However, i would pay the full price for this game after playing it. I am not sure why people are giving so many bad reviews. If you played warcraft 1/2/3 in the 90's you will love this game. Especiialy if you are aching for more games like that. Maybe the bad reviewers are young kids that never played the early 90's warcraft games. Who knows. Im glad i didnt just bypass this game because of all the thumbs down.\n\n@developer\nThere is one thing i wish it had that it does not. Multiplayer. Even warcraft 2 had LAN.

It has the ability to be a fun game, but its UI and resource system is too old-style. It needs it own style (think of Relic vs Blizzard RTS games: CoH/DoW vs SC/SC2). I know it's in early developement, but it really needs its own UI, I'm not kidding, if the UI doesn't get better along with its own touch this will be a wreck. With that said, this game has easy potential to become amazing. The graphics are nice along with the artwork. It is fun to play, even if it's in an early stage.

It is little bit rough, but seems stable and kinda sucks in. It tries to make it more personal with very small role playing part. The RPG doesn't give much options or way to affect things, but it's there nevertheless and somehow helps associating to the characters. Also, it tries to throw special missions during the big missions. Like once there was a tower defence  sub-mission. Doesn't get boring so easily.\n\nWhat I don't like is that I cannot queue actions with shift. Some other people probably won't like the simplified tactics against computer.

You cannot control your units.  The only thing you can do is send them to another place way from battle or target a particular enemy.  You cannot stop them from running after enemies that are far away.  They run from the other side of your base out past your defense turrets and get killed while you are trying to do something else.  there is no strategic setting to have your units stand their ground or patrol, or even be mildly aggressive.  Only full out aggressive.  The game has a level where it gives you missile units to protect your turret center and turrets, but they run straight out far away to the enemy ground units on the other side of the screen to attack them while your buildings get blown up.  You cannot even select them to target the air units.  They leave and go after ground units, leaving you buildings to be destroyed.  If a solder did that in real life they would be court marsheld and executed.  What a stupid game!  There is no military realism at all.  It is like it was programmed by a guy who only watches Sylvester Stallone war movies.  Don't even waist your 5 dollars.  Actually it does not even have anything to do with the money.

I'm out of this game solely because of the unit movements.\nFirst of all, having quick healer units is fine. Having quick healer units that outpace the rest of your army and get in the front every time is really a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ deal.\nEvery time you set a larger number of units to move to a location, they kinda scatter and move in a unreasonably loose formation.\nAnd the biggest deal breaker: If the units up front "block" the path from the units in the back, for instance in a bottleneck, the ones in the back will find a new route. In the second mission, that meant instead of waiting their turn and walking north as I asked them, they decided to take a detour which would have brought them to the other side of the map, not to mention through the enemy's heavily fortified base, which the AI had just warned me against.\nI can't deal with having to babysit every single unit in a game like this.","February 16, 2015","false","1.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Your units will not stay in one place no mater how many times to tell them to. If there is even 1 enemy with in your vision your units will go after them EVEN if they are on the other side of the map. When you try to tell them to move to one point they will change there mind so fast you cant hit the hold position button before they are scattered all over. When you use the hold command they will sit still but they will not fire on enemy's or defend themselves. So they will sit there and DIE unless you let them run all over them map at will. Movement is another problem, as units will not move together. When you give a move command all of your units will scatter around before they go the way you want them. Many will even go the opposite direction for a wile before they decide to go the way you want. Even if you give an attack order units will go in every direction before they get to your target.  This is a big problem as you will lose many units as they get there one at a time sometimes tow at a time. If you don't keep constant eye on your units they will all die and you will never even see it.\n\n-interface problems\nOne Major problem is you get no warning if you are under attack. The enemy can attack your base wile you are babysitting your attack units and you will never know. There is no warning on screen or on the map that you are under attack. This same goes for your units, they can wonder off and all die and you will never know it. You will not even have sounds unless you are looking right at the fighting. You would think explosions would make sounds at a distance but NO.\n\n-strategy problems\nThe one and only strategy that works is to get the long range lasers on ALL your units and zerg rush the enemy.  For all the different weapon types, the only one that works is the long rang lasers. If you try to use anything but them the enemy will mass them and blow you away before you get in range to attack. If you mass long range then the enemy will sit there and let you kill them. Only some times will they go after you and fight, other times they seem to just give up.\n\n\nSo much of this game is copied from other games, but its dune so poorly I cant recommend this game to anyone.","February 19, 2015","false","14.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Small core unit variants with user choice equipments. Each unit has its place. When I first jumped into a skirmish, exploring the world, ignoring tutorials to allow for self discovery and getting stomped for Easy AI after 15mins, it casted a stark reminder of KKND. The original, difficult, ruthless AI, quirky controls and tactical base expansion. None of the rush counter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t many newer RTS games compete to embrace for the "pro-gamers" nod. Meridian New World is bought to us by a small studio with wonderful graphics and simply fun. I, for this, welcome the game and future content was a wonderful surprise as generally I don't follow news.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sirpalee/recommended/265120/","sirpalee","[WRG] sirpalee","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sirpalee/","906 products in account","I’ve tried. Seriously. I tried when it was released and I tried after the 1.0 release. I really wanted to like this game and give it a bright review, but I couldn’t.\n\nLet’s start with the obvious one. The whole marketing campaign was built upon the (false) fact that the game was done by one people. It gained some attention around the early access release solely because of that fact. When the only good thing that you can quote (or you think worth quoting) from a major member of the game press is, “One Guy Shouldn’t Be Able To Make Meridian: New World”. There is something clearly wrong with your game or your marketing people. Sadly, it turns out it’s the game itself.\n\nSound. For me it was an instant no, I had to turn it off from the menu as soon as I heard a few seconds from it. Highly generic electronic music without a soul. The same thing about the soundtrack (I own the contributor edition), nothing unique there. The sound design itself is bad. All the voices feel mechanical, artificial. I don’t know if it’s because of the voice actors (there are some “celebrities” on the cast, so probably not) or due to some unexperienced sound engineer. Honestly, I don’t care, the result is simply awful. The same is true about the actual in-game sounds, they are like something from a bad sci-fi movie from the 80s. Or something that a cat would produce if put it in front of a midi keyboard.\n\nGraphics. The game falls short there to. I don’t expect the same quality visuals as from AAA RTS games like wargame or starcraft 2, but I was expecting at least a minimal amount of good taste from the designer. No, it doesn’t exists. Some effects are overused, no consistent style across the board and the GUI looks like if it’s done by somebody who discovered a few cool tutorials for photoshop. (quick fact, the same problem is there with all the games from the developer, all the UIs are a joke)\n\nGameplay. I could have lived with the other two being bad or amateurish, but not this one. The few missions I’ve played are just simply boring. No tactics involved whatsoever, the whole base / army management is clunky and badly done. No zoom functionality (erm, 2014, guys!) and all the game mechanics clearly shows that the developer has almost no experience with modern (and actually good) RTS games.\n\nWriting. The story feels simple, the cut scenes doesn’t support the whole flow of the game, and completely useless (why then?). Dialogues feel forced and unnatural (the bad voice acting makes it even worse), and the game tries to be too much like other games, providing unnecessary story sections, where you can wander around the ship, but it only makes all your choices and answers feel completely weightless. The best example is the first mission. You wander around on the planet for like 2 minutes, then immediately you are switched back to the ship’s view and now you are talking with your crew. The “flow” is too erratic and not enjoyable.\n\nMultiplayer. There is no multiplayer. It’s 2014, guys.\n\nSo, shortly. Don’t buy this game. For it’s normal price you can get entries from way better strategy games (wargame series!). If you have a few bucks to burn, and you want to support an indie dev, then it’s up to you. But as a game product, it falls short badly.\n\nIf you don’t believe me, just look at the reviews. When the game was released, it had a very positive standing (early access gamers tend to be way softer when it comes to reviews), but as soon as it reached a wider (and more critical) audience it went down to mixed.\n","December 2, 2014","false","3.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The only issue I have with this is that everything else about this seems done already.  The story itself (at least the first half hour) was fairly standard, and didn’t really feel very engaging.  The graphics, though pretty even at lower quality levels, seemed to get in the way more than anything else.  All in all, I would think that hardcore fans of RTS games would appreciate this, but really there are probably better ways to spend your time. Maybe after putting in a few hours, this game may have more substance, however that is not the context in which I am writing these reviews, so unfortunately, this is what we get.\n\nGame’s Fate: Uninstalled.

It struggles to reach the heights of better RTS games, such as Red Alert 3, Starcraft 2, Dawn of War, or just about any major 3D RTS game that has hit the market over the last ten years. The game has no aspirations, no distinctive qualities.\n\nThe variety in units and buildings is ♥♥♥♥ poor, and the skirmish match customisation options are just laughable, failing to even match up with RTS games released back in the 90's. The sound effects are basic, with guns and cannons emitting ugly 'ping' sounds, instead of something meaty and believable. The progression system and the in-game special abilities are interesting additions to the formula, but the abilities themselves are so slow and inconsequential, you'll have no reason to use any of them during a match save for some of the more powerful ones.\n\nCampaign-wise, from what I’ve experienced, you're stuck mainly with defensive objectives. I didn't play beyond the first four missions, so I can't comment much on the storyline, other than the dull voice acting and the lifeless setting of Meridian.\n\nThe only prop I can offer to this game is the inclusion of a map editor, which is a feature that has been exempt from many recent RTS releases. However, given that you have no real reason to invest much time in Meridian, I doubt anyone will create anything truly spectacular with the editor, since the game's online community seems to have stagnated over the course of development.\n\nMeridian is unremarkable, sharing the same basic gameplay elements and graphical palette as Starcraft II, only that it is nowhere near as fun to play. As an RTS, it's okay, but that's all it is. It's just alright. Average. Run-of-the-mill. You could name any well-known RTS game released since 2004, and I can guarantee that it plays, looks, and sounds better than Meridian, not to mention that it's probably retailing for around the same price, too.\n\nIt’s nice to see a new RTS game on the market, but we need more innovation than this.\nMeridian: New World gets a 4/10.\n","September 30, 2014","false","0.5"," 8 of 22 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","8","22","0","1"

Oh, there are a number of offshoots, but very few modern day RTS that still hold to the core root of the genre. Sadly while Meridian comes close, it still misses what I personally consider a true RTS.\n\nFirst the pros:\n\nPRO’s\n1.	Interesting set of weapons each with their own unique attributes. While fun, they do become redundant when all are unlocked.\n\n2.	Decent enough graphics. Cut-scenes are adequate with a few neat space shots.\n\n3.	So-so story, and a few unique missions that are out of the norm. Adding some variety.\n\n4.	Audio is well done.\n\n5.	Voice actors actually fit their role and put the appropriate emotion behind their lines.\n\n6.	Turrets and normal structure building expected of a RTS.\n\n7.	Missions where you have a locked group of units explore and fight maps. Requiring a certain level of timing and strategy.\n\n8.	Special orders/powers are always fun, and actually influence the game quite a bit. Especially on certain maps.\n\nCON’s\n\n1.	Units are incredibly limited by the end of the game. Very little variety.  With only 1 species/faction.\n\n2.	Story is so-so by the end, neither impressive nor a failure. Could have used something unique to spice it up.\n\n3.	AI programming can be very annoying. Example, send a unit to fight, but there is not enough room. So the AI sends the units around the entire map if necessary, rather than what most RTS do in pushing units forward so they can all shoot. If there is no route, they pile up waiting for the unit in front to die.\n\n4.	Long excursions, units will chase enemies to their death. Which requires the player’s constant attention in order to avoid pointless losses.\n\n5.	Some incredibly irritating missions, where the game locks you in place and forces certain actions without the options of a true RTS. For example, rather than a normal unit cap that only requires a little cache (or whatever the game wants built), Meridian has map locks where special expensive factories must be placed in unique zones that are not available on every map. Otherwise the unit cap is locked to under 10 – 20 units.\n\n6.	Mission completion usually entails exterminating an enemy’s every structure and unit. This can grow irksome when fighting multiple opponents, and a waste of time at the end. Where all you can do is cleanup of the map.\n\nWhile the game has a number of irritations, it also has some positive RTS draws. For the price, it is more than worth a purchase. I can only hope the developers will add some interesting content in the future.\n\nI give it 3.2 out of 5 for the overall gameplay, skirmish, and campaign.\n","December 24, 2014","true","8.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's not fun when you get a crappy ♥♥♥ defence and is tasked with defending a base that is constantly under attack. The defenses dont hold and your heroes all have death wishes, where they leap into battle every time they can. I really really hate maps where you have to be born in Korea to be able to beat. The games options are non-exsistant where the only game speed is TURBO.\n\nThe pacing in the game is way too fast for my taste, if it was more focused on micro which some maps are it would be a lot better.","May 2, 2015","false","11.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As it is now it's a fun way to while away the time and enjoy it for what it is. Don't expect anything ground breaking or new and you'll be sorted.\n\nOne gripe I do have though is that the hardware requirements from a graphics perspective are considerably higher than I would have expected but all things considered it's still a solid effort.","March 20, 2015","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
