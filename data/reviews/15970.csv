I love this type of game and these are generally the ones that make me hyper-rage, which is strange considering its so straightforward.","December 29, 2013","true","69.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

If there are 3 or more balls of the same colour, they will explode. If the 'snake' reaches the end before you've destroyed all of them, you will lose. Also, there are a few powerups to help you in your quest. That was about the simplest way to describe this game :)\n\nIt is hard for me to (not) recommend this game. Luxor is a fun little game and it will most likely enjoy anyone who enjoys casual games but the downside is that, on a regular day, this game will cost you 10 bucks, which is way too much. Also, like most Mumbo Jumbo games, there are (more ugly) other versions of Luxor available online for free.","January 4, 2015","true","3.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Why?\nWell, the gameplay is repetitive as ♥♥♥♥ (repeating levels every 3 stages, only to shove another new one in your face),\nthe game's difficulty curve is reminiscent of the slope of K2,\nand well, at first this game seems like nothing other then the normal marble shooter.\nHowever, it has this charm the wants you to see the ending sooooo bad, or to find out what that NEXT ADDED ♥♥♥♥ING LEVEL is, only to get owned by balls rolling into your base.  You just can't put this game down unless you've actually finished it.  Of course, this game's sequels are far better (and easier) and you should play them, but this is not simply a game you can just ignore.\n","February 14, 2015","true","13.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Steam people know that the products they sell have problems when downloaded.  Problems that are not related to the games themselves, hence all the legalese absolving them fom fraud or false advertising.  Don't purchase from Steam.","April 2, 2014","true","0.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

It is just as fun and addicting as everyone says it is.  My problem is that there is one game breaking level that is very poorly designed and lends it self to being so difficult that it isn't fun.  I am pretty good at Luxor and it was taking me hours to get past this level (and if you get a game over you might have to replay it).  And for reference, I could pass the level before and after it usually on the first try.\nThis series is great, but avoid this one.  One level just makes it torture to play.  There are others in the series much more fun than this.","June 20, 2015","false","10.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TRCheese/recommended/15970/","TRCheese","Τhe Rolling Cheese Wheel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TRCheese/","4053 products in account","This is probably the worse Luxor game out of the seven Luxor games available on steam. The Egyptian theme is very well done, but everything else feels very unoriginal and bland. I find the power-ups that do drop in Luxor to be very unsatisfactory and lacking in excitement. The map design appears to be rehashed continuously throughout the estimated ~8 hour play through. The music also doesn’t change; I just end up muting the game completely and listen to my own music collection while playing Luxor. If you are a hardcore Zuma fan you may find some redeeming qualities in this game, but to be quite honest I would much rather play Zuma or the superior Luxor known as Luxor Evolved. For everyone else that is not really a fan of this genre and game type; just go buy Luxor Evolved and Zuma.","August 8, 2012","false","8.7"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"

Fire marbles to match three and eliminate from the board before time runs out. Simple and fun. Only spoilt by the save system - you have to scomplete an entire stage before quitting or lose all progress.\n\n74/100","February 27, 2012","true","85.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
