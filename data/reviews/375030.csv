"http://steamcommunity.com/id/visionaryBlender/recommended/375030/","visionaryBlender","visionaryBlender","http://steamcommunity.com/id/visionaryBlender/","327 products in account","Summary: This Unity 2D platformer is a satirical commentary on the Polish politician Janusz Korwin-Mikke, and his party "Congress of the New Right" (Kongres Nowej Prawicy), commonly known as the "New Right" (Nowa Prawica), with his quest to annihilate the opressive threat of the ever-corrupt lefties. Straight away I can tell you if you know the context of this game, and know a decent bit about polish/european politics, then you should take this game into consideration when on sale.\n\nTo give a little background from someone who is decently engaged in the Polish political scene, and someone who was born in Poland, Korwin has been known to be one of the notable far-right wing/eurosceptic/anti-establishment/libertarian figures in Europe that have been actively seen as controversial due to statements made during the path of his career, and generally irrational and strong beliefs that don't necassarily adhere to the political status-quo. (semi-related figures from the west: Nigel Farage, Ron Paul, Donald Trump) How he differs from quite a lot of other figures is that, (in my opinion) quite a lot of the statements he makes are grossly spun out of context and overall exaggerated by biased media outlets, such as TVN, and that his ideas are quite agreeable with and  he can be quite a reasonable character, very strong in his delivery and very blunt and to the point, without being too edgy or too stupid in what he says.\n\nWhile I personally agree with quite a lot of the ideas he puts forward (disdain for the nanny state of the European Union and it's establishment, disdain for socialism, etc.), he is still an edgy character, and thus this game has spawned, in a goal to destroy the countless threats engrossing Poland, with various references to the political situation in Poland. Enemies being various figures seen in the media, relevant to polish culture, such as the ever infamous "Mohair Berets", the tongue in cheek term for the conservative, devout catholic demographic of elderly women. Another example is one of the bosses in the game is Jaroslaw Kaczynski (chairman of the PiS party, Prawo I Sprawiedliwość, aka. Law and Justice) an infamous figure in the political scene.\n\nAs for the game itself, well, it's a finnicky, cheaply thrown together platformer that is somewhat repetitive. The terminology of "old-school" is somewhat appropriate, adhereing to low-budget platformers and flash games. Controls are finnicky, design is poor, etc. etc.\n\nNow obviously I understand should you turn yourself away from this game, should you not care for the context and the references, because frankly, it's not a great game, and the only reason why I recommend this game is because it is decently funny and a decent play for the people that understand the satirical content. If you do however, on sale, it's a decent buy that can get the occasional chuckle out of you.","January 1","true","6.2"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"

Because ♥♥♥♥ socialism xD\n\nIt's very challenging. Levels are hard, at least for me. I had a challenge. Gameplay looks like every other platform game, but I like it. It's fun.\nYou will encounter many bad creatures, like for example: Kwaśniewski, Palikot, Grodzka/Grodzki/Grodzkie/whatever you call this thing, Rydzyk, Jaruzelski, Kaczyński, Tusk etc. Enemies are fun. Levels are fun too. But you must know Polish political scene to understand the humour of this game.\n\nCompleting this game will take you from 1 hour to max 2 hours, depending on how good in platform games you are. So it's very short, but I think it's worth its small price.
