According to that, I think it was a good deal taking into account how much I expended.\n\nThe game itself has beautiful graphics and if you like WWII aircraft, you´re going to enjoy the views. On the other hand, controls can be a little bit hard to get even if you have a gamepad (I strongly recommend trying different settings at the realism part of the game settings window) and after some missions, it gets kind of repititive.\n\nIn summary, not a good buy for 20$, but a reasonably good one for 5$ or less. I would rate it with a 6.5/10","November 27, 2013","true","7.0"," 41 of 54 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","41","54","0","0"

The flight mechanics are... rough to say the least.  The keyboard mapping is almost absent from what I can tell.  Flying by mouse, there are maybe five or so keys including a second primary fire button... just in case your left click breaks.  Taking off from a carrier I found myself rocketed abruptly upwards by some mystical force halfway across the deck and then when landing stopped about as abruptly as hitting a brick wall.  The voice acting in the campaign felt a bit forced and was empty of depth or feeling (especially in the Japanese campaign) and didn't really contribute anything to a storyline.  The missions are extremely repetetive as well (bomb a target, switch planes, bomb said target again).\n\nOn the better side, the game did have some pretty cool explosions and the planes burning out of the sky were as asthetically pleasing as it gets.  Bullet and cannon impacts in both soil and water are pretty well mimmicked although the auto aim defeats the whole purpose of WWII dogfighting.  Ships will sink if they are destroyed, which is nice, although I found it odd that the USS Arizona was capsized by torpedos and fully submerged in shallow water in about one full minute...\n\nAll in all I'd say this game is worth 3 out of 10 stars.  Would not ever recommend this to anyone looking for a "flight sim" despite what any of the trailers or pictures make it out to be.","June 19, 2014","false","0.7"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","17","21","0","0"

Like the name suggest, your plane mostly start from an aircraft carrier before flying into combat, and your main missions all the time is to protect your carrier from enemy attack while doing mission assigned to you in the same time. As the American Navy you will relive the story of the legendary USS Enterprise, the last surviving American aircraft carrier in the pacific.\n\nThe graphics of Air Conflicts: Pacific Carriers is quite good. The water shader are incredibly beautiful, and since the game are mostly naval sea battles/carrier battles, it makes the game so epic. The planes and ships models are also beautiful and realistic.\n\nAir Conflicts: Pacific Carriers is another good arcade game. I recommend this.\n\nRating 8/10","January 8, 2014","true","12.9"," 22 of 32 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","22","32","0","0"

As a history buff, especially concerning the war in the Pacific, this game has piqued my interest for some time. However, there are several historical inaccuracies, and gameplay becomes repetitive after the fifth hour or so. I have encountered multiple graphical bugs, and a game crash at the end of the final Japanese mission. If you can get this game for five dollars or less, and you love flight simulators or World War 2 flight games, then by all means go ahead and pick it up. But if you want a game that truly shines when showing naval and aerial warfare in the Pacific Theater, check out the Battlestations duology. Otherwise, stay clear of this noble but poorly executed attempt to recreate the War in the Pacific.","December 25, 2013","false","12.4"," 27 of 43 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","27","43","0","2"

It looks pretty in pictures... and plays so so.. but you will either have game stopping crashes, control issues where you cannot fly the plane (like a plane should fly) or just frustrating missions where the damage models are way off.  I wasted $9 on this piece of pretty crap and of course cannot get a refund.  Air Combat Secret Wars was fun... and I was hoping this was much better... looks MUCH better... plays MUCH worse.

Menu bugs that prevent you from going forward. Stuck missions - especially the ones where a certain ship is scripted to survive according to history making it really frustrating for the player that just 'accidentally' had 10 torpedo runs on the ship and every torpedo was a dud. I suppose miracles do happen on the pacific. War is hell.\n\nGraphics are gorgeous, story is pretty decent. Especially JPN campaign that is told by the daughter of the XO.\n\nGame strikes a pretty decent balance between arcade and sim and end result could be best described as satisfying enough.

The first one was published in Dec. of 2013}\nOK, my first experience with this game wasn't good - the game just crashed every few minutes, making it unplayable.\nNow, more than year later I decided to give it a chance launch it again - and it's a miracle! - it worked! It still crashes occasionally, but it's pretty playable now.\nBut I'll stand on what I've said before. This is very different game compared to previous parts. Difficulty had been pumped up - even on easy level with arcade control mode it still very challenging. Developers decided to remove infinite ammo, and the planes are getting damaged faster. Switching between them is weird and uncomfortable. Even rosters editing is very complicated.\nBut the main problem of this game - you don't get the feeling of the battle. The ships are just occasionally shooting the sky, enemy fighters very rarely engage you in a dogfight. And your own plane is moving like it has some sort of "car speed limiter" option turned on, and whether you're gaining speed or slowing it down - it doesn't matter, it will feel the same.\nThe pro's would be huge amount of missions on two campaigns - but that's a pro for those who'll like this game. Nice graphics. Also, the game mostly stays true to history books - if some particular ship had sunk in WWII, it will sunk in this game too, no matter what you'll do to protect it.\nMy advice - buy "Secret Wars". It's much more entertaining.","December 21, 2013","false","10.7"," 19 of 31 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","19","31","0","0"

As there isn't I have to select Not recommended.\n\nIt's an ok game, it plays well with  a joystick, I don't recommend mouse and keyboard, it's possible but not much fun.  To start with, this is not a sim as in people who play flight sims would possibly call one.  If you go in thinking you are going to play a WW II sim then you are going to be disappointed.\n\nThe reason I can't recommend this game is due to the game breaking bugs.   For example I have just uninstalled this game as I got to a point where I could not proceed any further for which I percieve as a bug.  I had to ram an enemy bomber, it just wasn't possible to get anywhere near it.  I am full throttle, full speed in a straight line and the mission fails before I can get close to the enemy. There is nothing else I can do, unless there is a hidden nitro button I am missing. I have started an new profile and even re-installed the game but the same mission fails.\n\nIt's very annoying as I wanted to see out the rest of the game.\n\nThe first game of the series is great and I do recommend that.

Don't waste your money.\n\nI was interested in seeing how historically accurate this game was, but couldn't get past the poor gameplay. According to other reviewers, it wasn't much. From the little bit I've seen of the game, it had a fairly simplistic view of the war and Japan. Quite honestly, it felt like the gang from Team America: World Police had a hand in the writing. I'd be intested in seeing the Japanese campaign, but the gameplay was much too boring - sometimes frustrating to actually bring myself to unlock it.\n\nThe keyboard controls are fairly simple. Hold Shift: go faster; Hold Ctrl: go slower until your engines cut out and you start to stall (good luck dropping torpedoes because you'll stall before you can go slow enough to drop them); Hold no keys: speed remains somewhere between stall speed and max speed; Hold Tab: Target cam (bonus points if you can spot the problem with this default); WASD: various camera angles.\n\nIf you're like me, you'll get bored once you figure out these basics and you'll be sitting with your head propped up on your arm trying not to fall asleep while you line up a shot with a slow moving bomber.\n\nThe game breaks a cardinal rule concerning the tutorial level. "The player cannot fail". If a player fails at any portion of the training level, he/she will have to play all the way through it again. At best, if a failure occurs, the game should commence from a checkpoint that's fairly close or the scenario should be designed in such a way that the player cannot fail easily. Instead, you can quite easily find yourself in a progression break where the only option is to suicide.\n\nThis game is developed and designed like a budget title. I'd say this game is worth maybe a couple bucks. Don't buy it if it's any higher than that.","January 2, 2014","false","0.9"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

This works fine in any other game, but AC:PC messes this up and tries to use both monitors, even if the configures resultion doesn fit... I'm not going to reconfigure my whole desktop setup everytime i want to play this game!.\n\nI also want to note that it has been ages where i've seen another game that has half the configuration options in an external program and half within the game engine.

Both campaigns are engaging and varied and the combat is pretty and fun.  Like previous installments, the AI occasionally forgets what it's supposed to do and flies in circles, but it's not a deal breaker as it's not constant.  Ship and plane explosions look as good in game as they do in the trailer and the multiplay is fast and fun.  Overall, expect an arcade flight sim and shooter, the management angles are very overhyped, but there are better games for that out.  You want a game to fly historic WWII naval aircraft that you and your friends can fight and bomb each other's carriers with?  This is your game.

I tried playing it with a gamepad, and it felt terrible too, that might just be me being used to Joystick, but I dont think so, I played all of the Ace Combat series on gamepad, and those felt a million times better when compared to how this game felt on a gamepad. Uninstalled. Secret Wars, the one before this is great, and the controls work far better on that one. If you plan on getting one of these get that, or wait for a Steam sale.

I'm writing about Linux version in this review!\n\nI bought this game in bundle with others for a few dollars. Well, I have to say that I'm pretty happy that I haven't paid 20$ for this.\n\nThis game is pretty easy to play, if you don't have problems with mouse just like I do (like moving inside rectangle - that effectivelly means that you cannot fly all the way you want, sometimes you can't climb or go down...).\n\nI don't really know what I expected of this game, but I know that my expectation was not met. I don't recommend this one, I just can't.\n\nEDIT (22nd december 2013): Well, after another 40 minutes of my life wasted, I still won't recommend this game to anyone. I'm playing this on Linux, I don't know if it is the same as on Windows with the problems - I can't see any enemy in watchtower mission (thus I fail them everytime), the game crashes every so often (~10 minutes), I can play mission 2 (can't see any enemies = failed mission), 3 (this one was fun), 4 (crashes everytime at the end), but I cannot play mission 1 because it crashes right at the start - everytime. I play it with PS3 controller now, it's much better (remember, mouse doesn't work for me; don't know why), but still - 20$ for this game? War Thunder with its graphics, models, aircraft types, details, ... is F2P and you want somebody to pay for this? No, thanks. I'm glad I didn't spent that much on this crap. Knowing it is that bad, I wouldn't buy it even in that Humble bundle...\n\nEDIT: (19th november 2014): Wait for it...

It does not present the most accurate or detailed portrail of the War but it is fairly enjoyable. The game feel slike it would be right at home on the Xbox 360 or Xbox 1. That does not mean its a bad game or it plays like crap o nthe PC but that it definitely is more of an arcade game based around conflicts in the Pacific then an actualy simulation of said conflict and its planes.\n\nWhat is refreshing about this game that unlike many others that offer unlimited ammo and tell you where to go, and point to you what to do the game has limited resouces and actually requires you to think and pay attention. (Oh my gosh no way!!!). So during a patrol mission for example like mission #2 you are told to spot the enemy. You have to take off and actually look for them insead of the game pointing it out ot you. I understand that this mechanic for some of you might not be appealing but I find it a breath of fresh air in a world of games that keep telling me what to do to a point that I don't even have to engage mentaly anymore.\n\nAnother nice touch is that durring combat you have limited amunition. For example you might have 5 planes in a single engagement and each will  have 1100 ammo. If you happen to run out of ammo you are screwed for that plane and he might get shot down. What you can do is switch and take control of any of the other planes by hitting the back button on the controller. This is a pretty cool mechanic and quite fun.\n\nThe graphics are very good in this game especially the water. The game is colorful, the sky looks and feels beautiful and the planes at least the conckpits look good. When you dive you will see the cockpit shaking and hear some windsheer. Explosions look good and enemy planes behave, break up and fall apart in unpredictable and random ways.\n\nI am playing the game on an xbox 360 controller. The game can also be played using the mouse and ising the keyboard. All control options allow for basic (arcaade) and simulation controls.\n\nThe music/score for the game is good although the few missions I have done so far a little repetative. It sounds like a movie score, being very cinematic. The game reminds me of a Michael Bay movie when in combat with the cinematic score, and good visuals.\n\nI think that this is a good game and I am enjoying it then again I don't have unrealistic expectations n where everything is either great or ♥♥♥♥ and nothing in between.

For this mode some training (like the training mission) is advisable. But even when using simulation, the game is still more arcade than some other games, so if you're a hardcore simulation fan, you won't miss anything here.\n\n\nThe missions are relatively straight-forward: Destroy that ship, destroy that many planes in XX minutes and so on.\nI lacks freedom, but if you don't mind that, the air-action is doing fine.\nThere are however some boresome missions, like on the japanese campaign where you have to do some very precise bombing with limited number of planes (and bombs, that is). Here I needed several relaods of that single mission to make it in time.\n\nThat being sad, the scripting is still buggy; and I don't expect it to be patched any more.\nIn 2 levels the level border (you cannot fly too far away from the main objective) is set really stupid; I even had 2 occurences where I switched to another, previously AI-controlled plane, and instantly ended up in loosing the mission due to "leaving the battlefield"...\n\nOverall, 60% of the missions are really enjoyable, the rest ranges from "nice try" over "boresome" to "annoying".\n\nAlso there is at least one real show-stopper bug:\nAfter finishing the last mission in the japanese campaign, the game crashed. And looking up in the game hub, it seems not to be an isolated problem--\n\n\nIn general the game is not bad. It's entertainable for about 8-10 hours each campaign and there is a multiplayer part.\nBut I suggest you buy this game only if you don't mind some bugs, a more or less arcade-like flying style and relatively straight-forward mission design.\n\nFor myselfI don't think I wasted my time here, but if I'd payed more than 5€, I would be sort of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ due to the bugs and mission design flaws.","January 4, 2014","false","11.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Meh, if you've ever played a flight sim and realized that its only fun for a short while, well that's my recurring experience with the genre too. This game would be much more fun to me as a level in a full videogame (Like how GTA V has pretty detailed flight in their planes). Just the game alone doesn't have enough diversity for me, the idea that you are going to be doing the same exact specific thing throughout the entire campaign, makes it hard to enjoy.\n\nOn an opposing note, there are different planes and different weapons and different enemy targets that do mix up the levels enough to make it bearable. The first couple levels are actually fun until you try to fire some torpedoes (Those things will always be a mystery to me), and if there was a bit stronger storyline, I might be able to get more into it. Text scrolls across the screen and shows you a map of pearl harbor and other islands. Actually as I'm writing this, I'm realizing how terrible this review will be. I mean its obviously targeted at people who are into flight sims and/or war games enough to read a review about one written by someone who has absolutely no interest in either. So how about this, don't trust me, unless you are here because you also dislike war plane games and for some reason want to give them yet another chance. I'd say if this game is free or under $2 then you'll probably enjoy it that much. Otherwise, it gets old pretty fast.\n\nThe biggest problem with the game is the ever changing difficulty level. Rookie, the lowest casual level gets hard to the point where all of the backup planes with be blown up before you can even switch to them. Don't even get me started on the actual simulation mode (as opposed to controller arcade mode).  So to summarize this confused/confusing babbling: It keeps you somewhat entertained briefly and then get too difficult to be fun anymore.

I gave up on it after trying for hours. It is impossible to fly with the Joystick (simulation) setting.  Yesterday I tried again and after messing with the settings for about an hour, I switched to Joystick (Arcade) and it is playable!\n\nIt looks good and has potential, but it is frustrating.  An early aerial patrol mission around the carrier group depends on using the radar in a totally new way (increasing the size of a flashing sector means you are getting closer).  They never mentioned what was inportant.\n\nTorpedos and Bombing are often misses because of torpedo malfunctions, etc. and I hit the bomb button exactly on the mark in bombing runs and still got a miss over and over again.

As in its predecessor, this game stays fun because of its core combat mechanics. Because each encounter can unfold with slight differences, there's an inherent "microvariety" that keeps the game from becoming too repetitive. Also, the combat allows for quick rewards that can keep you hooked.\n\nThe game isn't flawless by any means. Every once in a while, you'll run into an objective which has an unclear solution. There are also some issues with difficulty spikes, especially when squadron members are shot down before you even get a chance to make them useful. Also, the Japanese campaign seems to have a strange overabundance of "intentionally unwinnable" scenarios. If you know a bit of history, you can see these scenarios coming, but the way they're handled in terms of gameplay can be a little too vague at times.\n\n(Also, the graphics engine seems to struggle disproportionately when you fly through partially transparent features, like smoke.)\n\n"Pacific Carriers" is rather more challenging than "Secret Wars," especially since midair collisions have been implemented. Enemy fighters seem perfectly happy to simply smack into you, and you'll probably have a number of frustrating experiences where a squadron mate flies into you. On the flipside, I felt like this game allows for just that much more nuance in the flying, with working the throttle being much more meaningful than it was in "Secret Wars."\n\nLike its predecessor, this game has the potential to provide you with a gleeful and interesting romp through a number of air combat challenges. You do have to suspend your disbelief a bit, and the level of polish isn't quite "AAA," but it's plenty good and worth a look.","December 4, 2014","true","22.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For planes with rear gunner, you can go there too. Planes suffer realistic damage when hit. Flak will put holes and ragged edges to your control surfaces and wings, plane will start to smoke, and so on. Ground detail is also quite good, with all the terrain features very visible, and structures easily seen. Sound is decent.\n\nThe game gives you a "play in a team" feel by giving you several AI squadron mates. However, they don't seem to do anything. Instead, you can switch to them (swap planes) and fly them when your plane ran out of bombs or whatever. Then when you jump back out that pilot will fly back to carrier to rearm and come back out.\n\nHowever, the controls are horrible. I don't think it's my gamepad... which is a Xbox360 wireless only a few months old. I can't seem to stablize the plane to do the bomb or torpedo runs. The plane just bounce left/right/left/right as if my controls are lagging. After prolonged play all the planes want to nosedive (lost calibration). This doesn't seem to affect dogfighting much as planes are always going all over the place, but for stable bombing this is impossible.\n\nFurthermore, there's no explanation on bombing or torpedoing. Nothing in the manual.\n\nMissions are extremely long, as you are supposed to experience very bit of the battle. Instead of 3 different versions of battle from 3 different POVs, you will play all three... First you launch as fighters to sweep the sky of enemy planes, and bomb a few AA sites. Then you go in as dive bombers and take out structures and fuel farm. Then you play as torpedo bombers and torpedo 2 cargo ships just off the island. When bombing and torpedoing aren't working, frustration sets in.\n\nSomehow I just can't enjoy this game.\n\n\n\n","February 18, 2015","false","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
