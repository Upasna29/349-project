"http://steamcommunity.com/id/polly_s_hate/recommended/363920/","polly_s_hate","Polly","http://steamcommunity.com/id/polly_s_hate/","407 products in account","Just going by the screenshots, SWR JST DX Selective Memory Erase Effect may seem like a fairly unimpressive and milquetoast retro throwback, but in all actuality it's a solid little platformer with a cyberspace-tinged storyline that really goes places and enough variety and charm to make it well worth recommending.\n\nFirstly, this game looks wonderful in action. Screenshots really don't do the lush backgrounds and fantastic digitized-looking sprite work justice.  The interstitial animations also look great, and there's a fairly memorable soundtrack backing everything.  This is a game that does not drop the ball at all with its presentation.\n\nGameplay-wise, it's about as arcadey an experience as you can get. As a cute little robot ninja cat, you'll run, jump, slash, and throw daggers to overcome most of your obstacles, but the game's strength is the staggering amount of variety it manages to pack into all of its stages.  Nearly every world has a unique set of gimmicks and challenges to overcome and it's always shuffling you in and out of new situations so you never end up doing too much of the same thing for long.\n\nEach level is a fairly bite-sized affair, lasting roughly 30 seconds, and nearly all of them are fairly challenging (except the bosses. They're all chumps), but there's nothing that can't be overcome with a little persistence.  There are however a couple gimmicks that feel like they needed a bit more work.  The stages that drop your character into a boat with only a sword and some daggers to defend yourself don't feel properly balanced at all, and this is only emphasized later in the same world when you're able to equip your boat with a proper projectile weapon.  The mine cart stage a bit later in the game, though fairly short, is a nightmare of randomly generated nonsense that can create many impossible situations and was really a low point for me.\n\nOther than those niggling flaws, I had a blast with the game.  It'll take you just over a couple hours to see it to completion, and even though the overly easy boss encounters kind of make for an anti-climax, the storyline and stages leading up to them are definitely solid enough to stand on their own.","November 18, 2015","true","2.5"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

It even has the menu set up as an operator menu. It's pretty solid, my only gripe is that some of the platforms can be a little deceptive about where they end (turning your double jump into a single jump to your death...), otherwise though, it's a game you can play through in an afternoon. And you have to, as it has no save feature, only the ability to infinitely credit-feed. That said, it's forgiving enough. Any levels longer than a few screens seem to silently checkpoint themselves, there's no timer, and powerups are relatively frequent. The game changes tactics from world to world as well, so it doesn't run the risk of repetition.\n\nI dig it. Well worth a pickup.","July 3, 2015","true","4.2"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

DABS","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tentacles/","376 products in account","On my system this game is subject to a very strange bug: SWR runs at half speed unless I have a dinput device plugged in like my PS360+ based stick or 3D Extreme Pro flight stick. SWR doesn't recognize the directional input on the former and the latter is wildly unsuited to platformers. So I have to plug in a controller and then use my keyboard. Weird, lazy stuff Nekomura Games.\n\nHaving said that it's a perfectly serviceable indie platformer, well worth the five bucks even with the gamble that you'll run into the same bug that I did.","April 20, 2015","true","0.6"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zazzzel/recommended/363920/","zazzzel","陳先生","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zazzzel/","289 products in account","Overview\nAdopting a retro arcade 8-bit art style, the SWR JST DX Selective Memory Erase Effect, or Sword Justice Deluxe Selective Memory Erase Effect plays as a 2D platformer where you move your character, a mechanical android cat through different layers of fear clusters in order to reach an end terminal to log out and return to the real world where his link partner, M1Mi resides in.  Along the way, the cat meets many parts of the operating system that take a physical form as enemies.  In order to progress through the game, players must complete each level by moving their character from the left to the right; killing enemies along the way which will increase your score.  The developer has taken an extra step, whether intentional or not to bring the complete experience of a CRT arcade cabinet by featuring in-game screen brightness control for CRTs’, three button layouts found on cabinets and of course, infinite continues.\n\nThe Good\nSWR JST DX Selective Memory Erase Effect follows true to the standard cabinet platformer.  To give an idea of how the game is like, think of the original metal slug, except your default weapon is a blade instead of a pistol.  Jumping, ducking, dodging, button mashing all the good mechanical components of cabinet games are retained in SWR JST DX SMEE and mesh really well to play a fun to play game.\n\nSWR JST DX Selective Memory Erase Effect’s visuals are extremely well done.  For a game with only 256 different shades of colours to work with, this game manages to bring colourful visuals with unique background design for every chapter.  Although enemy mechanics and attack patterns were used in more than one type of enemy, each chapter of the game introduced new and special looking sprites for all the enemies.\n\nThe difficulty of the game increases at a reasonable rate.  The first few chapters introduce players to the mechanics, and slowly become more demanding, such as throwing daggers while dodging and immediately air strafing in the opposite direction to slash an incoming enemy.\n\nThe plot is based off of a good concept which actually revolves around an inner conflict that appears within the player. Taking a step back, you can see there are two sides of the story.  One of which is really evident to the player, the cat’s drive to log out of this nightmare and return to M1Mi.  But in order to reach the terminal, all the operating system enemies’ have everything that they longed for destroyed.  Looking back into the dialogue between the main characters, reveals that the main antagonist isn’t even truly evil, but just someone whose ideals sided with the OS components.\n\nThe Bad\nLet’s start with the game itself.  Mentioned earlier, I’m not sure whether or not the developer decided to bring about the whole experience of old arcade games including the problems, or was just simply limited by the game engine they are working with.  Please note, at the time of writing this review, the game cannot save, meaning each time you start the game up, you have to start from the very beginning.  The argument may be that the game is short and can be completed in one sitting, but it is just a poor excuse that a save function not be implemented, if high scores can be recorded.  SWR JST DX SMEE also has problems shutting down properly.  The window may close, but it hangs on steam locking you in-game.  In order to play your other games again you have to shut down steam and restart the client.\n\nLevel design is not the best, and is very evident in the ice chapter where you utilize the same run and gun strategy.  Progression between levels can be spontaneous and abrupt with no warning narrative as seen by the mine cart stage. The result is a lot of gimmicky level designs that force you to lose a life no matter what, unless you’ve played through a second time.\n\nThe game itself is contradictory as to the scoring style.  2D side-scrolling platformer games like these usually are fast paced because they provide you with a ranged default weapon and unlimited ammunition.  Since SWR JST DX Selective Memory Erase Effect gives you a sword as a default weapon, you will often find yourself kiting backwards and staying just outside of the enemy hit range.  Anyone who has played a 2D side-scroller knows that going back the way you came from breaks the tempo of the game and since scoring is widely based off of number of enemies killed, you are forced to kill your enemies, making pacifist and speed runs totally redundant, not to mention impossible on some of the later levels.\n\nThe plot itself is pretty shallow and leaves a lot to be desired.  Yes, the writer may have been going for a hero vs villain scenario, but nine lines of text between levels is not enough for the player to connect with the characters, leaving an empty and hollow characters.  It really is not enough for the player to judge the scenario correctly, and is hard to sympathize for the other cast of characters that are being antagonized.\n\nOverall Score\nAs a complete package I rate Sword Justice Deluxe Selective Memory Erase Effect at 4/10.  This game is just too large of a hassle to get up and running and an even bigger annoyance when it comes to shutting down.   If you look at just the game, I would personally score this game at 6/10 just for the amazing visuals and good controls.  The reason it isn’t higher is because the game really falls short in terms of level design.  But if the game’s art piques your interest and your computer successfully passes the  tech demo [nekomuragames.itch.io], give this game a try.\n\nFor similar Steamified Reviews and Giveaways please visit  Steamified [www.steamified.com].

Not stingy on lives and checkpoints so practically anyone can finish it, but if you want to challenge yourself you can shoot for a high-score.\n\nPleasing to both the visual and the aural receptors.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/boostmetal/recommended/363920/","boostmetal","Stupid McNoheals","http://steamcommunity.com/id/boostmetal/","960 products in account","Aesthetics-wise, there's nifty pixel art with some effects reminiscent of those found in Dynamite Headdy or Mischief Makers, and the music is pleasant.  Play-wise, expect something of a cross between I Wanna Be the Guy and Dark Souls - one hit will kill you, and some enemy placements are designed to surprise in a seemingly unfair way, but if you go slow and take the time to analyze level patterns, success won't be so far off.  With that said, the player starts with plenty of lives, and there's infinite continues for those who don't care much for high-scores.  The minecart section is a jerk, though, especially the tail-end.\n\nThe game can be played through in an afternoon or less, which is fine, but there's no saving level progress, only score.  Another potential issue is that the game can hang after closing, leaving one's Steam status reading as in-game long after one has stopped.  It might be an issue with the Steam overlay, so a solution could be disabling that, maybe?  I haven't tried it, but since these issues aren't too terrible, I'm still satisfied with this purchase.","November 6, 2015","true","1.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The backgrounds/atmospheres are not bland. The platforming is solid, never had a problem with it. Some of the enemies are put in unfair places, but the game is generous with lives/continues.\n\nMy only main gripe is the minecart section. I spent an entire continue on it because the first obstacle was a jump...and there was always a boulder right above me. Incredibly frustrating because it just became luck at that point, hoping I didn't have to jump when there was a boulder coming down.\n\nAlso, you have to play this game in 1 sitting. There is no save feature except for scores at the very end.\n\nOverall it was a pretty nice experience, but I don't expect to play it ever again.","November 8, 2015","true","1.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
