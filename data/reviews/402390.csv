It's multiplayer asteroids!!!  With a very polished overall game design.  It's literally perfect.  Everything from UI, controller support, design aesthetic, the works.  I had a blast playing it.  You can drive batmobiles and Back To The Future's DeLorean among other cars that are designed to look like the real thing (Corvette C3!!).\n\nI can't wait to try this out with friends.  There are a lot of modes like soccer which should be very interesting when you are playing with some buddies.\n\nI guess the only thing they could add is online multiplayer.\n\nSUPER impressed.  ONE BILLION STARS out of 10.  What a time to be alive.  I remember how fun it was to play asteroids back in the day... But multiplayer deathmatch asteroids?  I never would have even imagined this.\n\nBest with friends.  Co-op AI is really difficult but not impossible.","January 7","true","0.4"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","15","19","2","0"

The duration of each match is long enough to for the heat of the competition to come up, but short enough so that everybody can have his own revenge in a matter of minutes.\nSkills matter in this game, but in the chaos of action, some luck helps too, so that players who are behind do not feel too overwhelmed and have some chance of getting back in the game.\n\nThe game modes are varied and offer a wide choice to suit a group subjective preference. Pong and soccer are especially great and fun.\n\nThe action is chaotic and you'll spend enough time after the game talking with your friends about epic moments, unlikely suicides and own-goals and "friendly" fire. If your friends are still with you, that is.\n\nTL;DR : highly recommended!\n","October 13, 2015","true","1.3"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"
