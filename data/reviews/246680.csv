It's hard to explain it gameplay wise. But you're a bird and you have to find artifacts that are scattered all over the world. You might say that it's a Metroidvania game but it's not. You won't gain any skills or abilities and all places are freely accessible. The goal is mainly to survive, while finding these artifacts. There are several types of 'enemies' and not all of them will attack you on the spot. Some of them will try to grab you or your artifact and others will just leave you alone because they're lower on the food chain. You can go faster by flapping your wings and you can even dive to increase your speed. The controls are unusual but work very good.\n\nThere's no map system in the game so you have to find everything by scouting the areas carefully. This can be hard, but fortunately the game is only a few hours (3-4) long so the world isn't that big.\n\nI really enjoyed playing the game, but one thing that bothered me was the fact that you can't continue the game once you finish it. So make sure you do everything before dropping that last artifact, unless you want to play through it again, of course.\n\nThere's always room for improvement and Secrets Of Rætikon is no different. But despite its shortcomings I had a great time playing in this magical and very stylish world.\n\n[Rating: 84/100]","April 24, 2014","true","2.8"," 81 of 95 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","81","95","0","3"

It’s a game of peaceful puzzle solving and nonlinear exploration disrupted by annoyingly persistent enemies, and no means of attack to ward them off. More than anything though it’s a game of false allegations of an overarching mystery, that in the end is nothing more than a horrendously incomprehensible and random moment, preceded by an unnecessarily grotesque event that quite frankly made me sick.\n\nAt it’s core, Rætikon is constructed like a large fetch quest collectathon, requiring you to explore levels in order to collect scattered shards which can then be used to power up ancient machinery. These machines exist both in opening new pathways for you, and in presenting you with larger shards which must then be brought back to a sort of hub and deposited into the sockets of yet another large machine.\n\nThough it had the potential to be an enjoyably open experience, allowing you to freely traverse the world as you hunt for these shards and machines, Rætikon idiotically forces you to spend an aggravating amount of time back tracking through levels in order to return to the hub. This could have been avoided with a better connected world, but with only two paths into the hub, you’re required to haul your luggage through numerous screens over and over again. This is made even more frustrating do to the inevitable games of keep away you get into with other animals, which can sometimes make the simple act of getting from one side of the screen to the other almost painful in how aggressive the other creatures are.\n\nThis all adds up to make Secrets of Rætikon an absolute chore to get through. It’s a gorgeous game, with some incredible origami-like artwork, a fantastically ambient soundtrack and great sense of atmosphere, but it’s all brought down by some horrible design decisions that sour the entire experience. When you finally get to the end it only makes matters worse, with a disturbing and baffling turn of events that sells home the point that the designers seemed to have little idea where they were going with their game, nor a clue how to get there.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","August 30, 2014","false","2.1"," 97 of 120 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","97","120","0","11"

I also haven´t read previews so far, so I was relativley unbiased.\n\nThis first hour was a real joy!\nThe controls are very intuitive and after a few minutes you get what the game is about without much explaination.\nBut very soon I came in contact with the first few highlights in form of the curious animal life.\n\nI don´t want to spoil too much but there was this particular situation where I, a bird, cleared the entrance of a cave in a wood while being chased by some wildcat and after being rewarded with an artifact that sat on top of a deers antlers, I had to chase the deer while still being harrassed by the cat. It resulted in tricking the cat away for a moment so I could grab onto the deers ♥♥♥, pulling it to a dead end so I could wrestle away the artifact.\n\nShortly after this I experienced one of the best situations in a 2D game I experienced so far, when I had to get away with another artifact but the trees just wouldn´t let me ( I don´t want to spoil it for anybody, but it is awesome)\n\nLong story short, I can already fully recommend the game, because only one hour into it, it was somehow already worth its money. I am very much looking forward to continue tomorrow and have a look at that editor some day.\n\nGo for it, it will make you feel good :D\n\nAnd yes, there is a stat for how many seconds you already played (besides the stats how many other animals I ACCIDENTALLY! killed)\n","January 7, 2014","true","2.5"," 64 of 75 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","64","75","0","2"

It  was strange that despite my near death experience I couldn’t help but feel that these lands felt promising in being a tranquil place to live the rest of my life. Unsure of what was to become of me…\n\nThe world looked incredibly strange, full of triangle shaped forms, from the trees,caves and sculptures down to the animals themselves. Unsure of my surroundings I had to familiarize myself with what would be useful. Finding red triangles I noticed made me healthier while the blue triangles when gathered enough saved my life.  Funny how these items were of similar shape and resemblance to my environment. Forming together a sort of harmony.\n\nFurther traversing the lands I noticed that inserting the triangles I found, into the towers would make them activate. I noticed how they would shine - like they were calling for me to pull the levers. What I found interesting the most was the golden triangles that seemed important though I was somewhat awestruck and confused of their purpose of being held within these contraptions. I realized later that I could insert these gold triangles into a machine that revealed a prison of animals. I was determined to free them from their cages once I have found the rest.\n\nBefore I knew it I was altering the land by lifting rocks out of passages and solving puzzles to unlock paths. The place became more and more dynamic the more time I spent on interacting with the environment, shaping the terrain to a degree sort of speak though albeit a small degree.\n\nThe journey seemed difficult but I learned some new tricks as I explored, though there were some issues in actually using these tricks…Calling out to find objects hidden within the world elluded me If i was carrying anything of significant importance.\n\nOne time for example the black triangle I was carrying around was being indicated when I called out to objects, I didn’t notice this at first and was wondering why my senses seemed to freak out and rotate so much. Making me somewhat - dumbfounded at my own foolishness. I had to abandon the object in order to properly search around for the treasures of the world.\n\nGoing around and around was pretty tiring, having to see the same environments several times again since the point of interest was in the middle of the forest. Especially when enemies got in the way and stole my triangles it was rather annoying having to fight them for it - I tried my best not to kill them though. I progressed slowly closer and closer to my goal of collecting all the gold triangles to activate whatever the giant machine did until there was only one left.\n\nFinding the last gold triangle - quite frankly has given me far more trouble than I bargained for. I looked around the world several times backtracking here and there, in order to find whatever I missed that could lead me to it. Constantly trying to avoid danger while looking for news ones I couldn’t help feel that what I was doing was a fruitless labor.\n\nThe statues I rebuilt to their former glory might have helped me navigate through the forests - however being able to find that last piece was still a pipe dream. I was simply losing my mind at this point and picking fights with the local birds that have long annoyed me since the beginning, slaughtering them left and right to never see them again.\n\nEventually what would happen is a land of lifelessness and void of any creatures, my madness for created by the lust of the last gold triangle got the better of me. Now barren in this world where I live I looked up at the sun and attempted to suicide, being thrown down by the strong winds I decided to take a dive into the water latched onto a rock and allow myself to suffocate - until my very being was taken from this world.\n\nConclusion\nThe world looked pleasing, unique and interesting to explore. Outside of the eye candy though laid a series of bad game design choices concerning navigation. The restrictions put on you from really ascending to great heights - to the frustration of having to backtrack constantly back to the hub. There is a lot of potential this game had if it were to erase the backtracking by making the activation of the mechanisms trigger the cages instead of the triangles but the over-focus on this element lead to the game’s downfall of making it into a tedious chore.","January 31, 2015","false","14.6"," 48 of 60 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","48","60","2","0"

There is also something to be said about the emotions this game sparked in me, which range from laughing obnoxiously loud to feeling super depressed because I accidentally killed a little critter. I think it has somthing to do with the animals and the minimalistic approach to the graphics (which are absolutely beautiful). It really is a thinking mans game. It task you with collecting silver pieces for the "machines". It's simple yet enthralling. Simply getting past an opposing animal can be done in various ways. If you want to fight grab a spiked branch and hit him with it. Want to set up a secenario in which another poor creature gets caught up in a battle to the death so you can continue untouched? So many options and functions are in play. The games physics are so very real and fun.\n\nThere is so much mystery about the story and the Runes and what is actually going on in the Alps. I am very ready to find out what that is. For an Alpha that I bought For 7 or so bucks I'd have to say I am in love with this game. I cannot wait to see what the Steam community has to bring to this game as well. The game also comes with all the developers tools to make this game. So if you feel the need to rework things or submit your own idea's you can. What an awesome and refreshing approach from an indiDev.\n\nKeep your eye on this game closely.

After the game started I was smoothly flying around and enjoying the relaxing atmosphere in a world with a nice Сubism art style.  The game explained simply is; find collectables to get other collectables to finish the game. Which sounds stupid but while you do this you will encounter many obstacles and enemies. Also there are other things to explore which can add to the story of  Rætikon. Sometimes you really have to think about your movement so you can get to that certain area. I liked that in this game I sometimes felt sad because I had to kill other animals or plants to get health. I have to say that I didn't enjoy  Rætikon to it's fullest because on my laptop I played some parts without sounds. Which really reduces the feeling of being in nature. I have to say I didn't really like the ending. But I think that may had something to do with the  studio having to rush that part. Because this game didn't and still doesn't get that much attention. What I respect the dev's for: They kept on going to finish the game, because they know that these kind of games are missing in this industry.  The only positive side of the game not being popular is that you really have to find everything out by yourself.\n\nWorkshop community:\nDead.\nNo support at all.\n\n\nShort:\nA nice relaxing game where you explore around flying as a bird.","August 4, 2014","true","8.2"," 32 of 39 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","32","39","0","0"

As has been noted in many reviews, the repetitive nature of the game is definitely a flaw, although if you're good at finding the shortcuts, hauling back the keystones from the altars isn't too bad.\n\nWhat really breaks the game for me, though, is the enemies. Some of them aren't too bad, just occasionally pestering you, but the damned lynxes and buzzards are nightmares. They're absurdly aggressive, and do pretty substantial amounts of damage, and very much get in your way when you're trying to get around or solve puzzles. I got six keystones back to the central area before I just couldn't take it anymore. I just wasn't having fun.\n\nThe sad thing is, this could easily be solved by just taking out the enemies. Honestly, you wouldn't even have to take them out completely. Just make an easy mode with no enemies (and perhaps reduced damage from thorns) so people can actually enjoy the game instead of tearing out their hair in frustration over the unrelenting onslaught from the enemies.\n\nLike I said, the game is almost good. If the repetitiveness doesn't bother you too much and you can deal with the incredibly obnoxious enemies, I'd honestly recommend the game very highly. It's got good visual and sound design, the gameplay is solid, and there's some good, fun exploration and puzzle solving to be had. I just can't stomach the downsides enough to keep playing.","August 1, 2015","false","1.5"," 26 of 31 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","26","31","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kittycatgirl2k/recommended/246680/","kittycatgirl2k","kittycatgirl2k","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kittycatgirl2k/","337 products in account","This game ranks as one of the biggest disappoints of my life and disturbed four people that represent three generations of gamers. Good job Broken Rules!  We all need therapy now!\n\nAs you can see from the screenshots, Raetikon is visually stunning, with gorgeous graphical design and an engrossing world.  It plays like a simple Metroidvania type game that relies on puzzle elements.  Areas are gated off behind a "collect the bits" mechanic, but everything is so pretty, you don't even mind.  The creature designs are origami given life.  You play as a weird bird with shoes, that controls very much like the arcade game Joust, which works very well and seems fluid.  The game dumps you right into the action, leaving you to figure things out, which is refreshing with all the hand holding these days.  The story is pieced together by collecting runes to decipher ancient tablets, a gimmick that my kids and mother both enjoyed as they worked together to crack the code.  It's not a necessary thing to accomplish to beat the game, but a nice side diversion.  The music is also suitably haunting.\n\nSounds good so far, and it is.  We enjoyed the laid back pacing that I would liken to the exploration of Proteus or Journey.  Some have complained of the difficulty, but I had no issues, and only died once, in the bramble maze while being reckless.  And there's two major issues with this short little game.\n\nBUG.  I have seen on forums where the developer promised to fix this over a year ago and guess what?  They didn't.  It's still there.  If you open the areas in an order that the developers did not intend, the game becomes impossible to complete the traditional way.  You get to a point where you are short three gold slivers to progress, and they simply do NOT exist if you mistakenly tackled the areas in the wrong order.  This happened to me and the only way past it is through ANOTHER BUG that allows you to access the end areas by an obscure method.  We wandered around for almost two hours backtracking, thinking that we were just missing a few slivers.  It was triple checked, so I hit the internet and found mention of this bug on a forum.  None of this was repaired as promised, so do NOT leave the area above the evil tree for last or you will have problems.\n\nFINALLY... it's the ending.  It IS memorable, you can't take that away from it, but does it ever kill a bit of your soul and leave a bad taste in your mouth.  You go from heroic hope to stupid and evil.\n\nSPOILERS!!!\n....\n....\n...it seems through the whole adventure of Secrets of Raetikon that you are trying to save animals in cages.  Yet at the end, you find out that you kill them and use their blood/essence to power a primitive game of Pong.  After the credits, it dumps you into free roaming mode.  The real horror is here, for not only did you murder the caged animals, but EVERY SINGLE animal on the planet.  Everything is dead.  Everything.  So your stupid bird could play Pong.  It's depressing and senseless.\n\nWe had talked about how fun it would be to just go back and replay it but that's not happening now.  Your journey seems pointless, tainted and corrupted.  Raetikon leaves a black splotch on your heart and a dead feeling in your soul.  My kids were disturbed, and my mother was so messed up she watched several Let's Plays on youtube just to see other rections and if there's another ending.... the answer is NO.  No other endings.  You can't change it.\n\nTherefore, I have a hard time recommending it, even though it's this lovely, wonderful game up until the end.\nIf you don't mind absurdly bad endings and would like a game that combines Castlevania:SOTN, Journey, Proteus and Joust together, then give this a shot.  Personally, I doubt we will ever play it again.  We discovered the Secrets of Raetikon afterall...\n\nThe secret was... the ending sucks.","December 16, 2015","false","6.8"," 37 of 51 people (73%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","73","37","51","5","4"

All the good jokes  end up in the trailer, very often making the movie seem interesting. Then you go about watching it and realize there's not much meat on those bones. The whole movie can fit in those 5 minutes of trailer footage and nothing would be lost. Secrets of Rætikon is like that - screenshots and videos oversell it. It's a visually charming game, yes, in which you get to fly through a forest filled with wildlife and mysteries. And that's pretty much it.\n\nDownsides list is a bit more extensive than that. Let's start with the name - "æ", seriously? How do I even type that, let alone read it? Nevermind, let's go further. In SoR, you'll learn that forest animals are quite the racist scumbags. Nothing would unite a falcon, a crow and a lynx better than a killing campaign against an orange bird (= the player). And they're quite persistent about it, to the point where trying to move an object from screen to screen often becomes a Sisyphus's task.\n\nThe exploration part of the game is somewhat hindered by a lack of map or any other kind of orientation tool. This becomes most obvious near the end of the game - if you lack one item to finish the game, it may take you quite a while to find it. SoR is on the short site - it provides around two hours of gameplay, unless of course, you miss that one item, in which case the time might easily double.\n\nEndgame sequence is one of the most wtf moments you'll ever witness by finishing a game, and not in a good way. After a gruesome scene that makes all your effort either seem in vain or just plain disturbing,  you get to play a dull dull dull match of pong and see a "game over" screen even if you win it.

I will update this if I am able to finish the game or new and relevant info presents itself.\n\nFirst off, this game is beautiful. For what it is, I cant think of a more artisitic presentation. Really, really pleasing to look at.\nSo, what is the game? hehehe...that is actually a good question. You are a bird, flying around, finding translations to the symbols that are seemingly used to present the story that defines the world. I have found ten so far I believe, so 16 to go (although I doubt I will need all 16 to translate the story). You are also unlocking aspects of the world, wich so far have been represented by releasing new animals into the environment. I have unlocked four of these so far, with another 6 or so to go. Each is a cage on a very large structure which you pick up pyramid pieces for and return to it to unlock said animal cages. The pyramid pieces are found by repairing other structures around the map, which you do by collecting and assembling the broken pieces of statues (so far) or by collecting other smaller pyramid pieces which you can, when you have collected enough, unlock the other buildings which then open up new map sections that hold the main pyramid pieces.\n\nWhile you are doing all this, other birds and as you progress, other predatory creatures such as the lynx that you have released back into the wild, will attack you and each other, steal the pyramid pieces, and generally mess with you. You can fight back, which takes the form of dive bombing them, picking them up and dropping them from heights, causing the environment to hurt them (such as causing rock slides), and so on. You also have to contend with the winds, thorns, and other natural obstacles. You can regain health by uprooting small trees, saplings, and also by killing other critters.\n\nanyway, so far, I have found all this to be quite interesting and yet marginally confusing all at once. You are pretty much left on your own to figure all this out, which is fine. The one real impediment however is a lack of an actual map so as to figure out where you are and how to get back to where you possibly might need to be. No map equals a lot of unnecessary flying around at times, trying to find your way back to the big building to unlock the next cage, and presumably later, even more wandering around tring to read all the statues that hold the runes you need to translate in order to actually read the storyline, lol. I really would have liked to have seen a map or mini map included with this game. That said, I am still enjoying the game and intend to continue on, but man....please ALWAYS put maps in games that require a lot of travel back and forth through a lot of different sections!!!\n\nOh...btw...this is a 2D metroidvania style scroller (the gameplay isnt metroidvania however, lol).","January 10, 2015","true","1.0"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","17","20","0","2"

On one hand, its an exploratory world with puzzles and secrets to uncover.  On the other hand, it's an RPG with fetch quests, trials, obstacles and things trying to kill you.   These two halves do not mesh as well as they should and the mechanics that would be forgivable in a pure exploration game do not hold up for a battle-less RPG.\n\nBoiled down to it's core, the game play is find the glowing bits, collect them all, feed them to a machine and then activate the machine which either gives you a different glowy bit to bring back the big machine in the middle, or helps you open a door to go through to continue the cycle.   This on it's own, isn't bad. Standard RPG/puzzle quest.  But the controls do not have the proper fine tune to allow the player to actually accomplish these goals easily.   After activating one machine by a door, it dropped down a battering ram that it took me a good 15 minutes to get to actually hit the door in a way that actually broke it down.\n\nAnother section involved a maze of thorns that you had to fly against the wind to navigate.  Flap wrong and you're thrown into the waiting thorns much like a ping pong ball and it's near impossible to recover without being thrown into another bed of thorns.    In another, after successfully activating a machine, I was presented with another challenge, having to get a glowing bit from a running stag.  Due to the limitations of the controls and the flaky flapping mechanic, I eventually just gave up as I was never able to get my character to do anything that got it even close to the runner.\n\nThe visuals of the game are pretty impressive. Stylized, but not in a way that comes off as pretentious.  If it weren't for the aggressive birds, excessive thorns and fighting against the controls to try and get from place to place, it would be a very nice, laid back exploratory game, which the ambient sounds and lack of any narrative present it as.  But at it's heart, this game more comes off as a frustrating, non linear puzzle platformer who's mechanics just can't hold up to what the player needs to do.  Perhaps with a game pad or under windows, it would work better, but I have neither of those things to test it with, and the graphics and atmosphere alone are not enough to make up for the high level of frustration this brings.","July 4, 2014","false","2.5"," 37 of 57 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","37","57","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyrilpanda/recommended/246680/","cyrilpanda","Cyril","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyrilpanda/","596 products in account","The premise for a good game, trapped in a mediocre one. Rather disappointed in this game, all things considered. The entire design of the game is just... flawed. You have to find things in the game world with no indication of where they are and no map to look at when you're not sure where else is left to check, so you can end up running around in circles because you have no clue where you need to be. When you find the relics you need, you have to bring each. and. every. one. back to one room. This involves carrying them across multiple decent-sized screens, with other wild animals chasing you and trying to steal the relic from you, at which point they toss it between each other in an attempt to ♥♥♥♥ you off, err, I mean, keep it away from you. What does this tedious slog accomplish? It's not more than a frustration builder. Not even "hard", just frustrating. There's also instances where you have to attempt to solve a puzzle with an animal attacking you (and no effective way to fend it off) which usually results in tanking damage to get what needs to be done, done. The game's save system is bare-bones, to the point where it can only hold one fixed state, so everything you do is permanent and it's possible to glitch in the terrain or otherwise make the game nigh-unwinnable in various ways. Fortunately, the game is short (a few hours, max, and only some 6-7 major screens, with a few subscreens). Which is for the better, since any bigger and it'd be impossibly frustrating.\n\nI like the premise though. The main character controls well, the environment is pretty, the music relaxing. The language, not so much, I would've preferred an auto-translate for any runes you'd found, I couldn't be bothered to translate myself. The ending's also not great. To spoil it, spec ops: the line, bird edition. That's not really an explicit spoiler, but ehh. The game's story isn't exactly the focus here, as far as I can tell.\n\nOverall, I wanted to enjoy this game, but there's just... not a lot to enjoy.","November 22, 2014","false","4.7"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","14","18","2","0"

It took a little longer, and there've been some other competators (Creeper World III, being the front runner, though I think it's a '13 game as well), but I can safely say Raetikon is my GOTY for 2014.\n\nIt's an absolute joy to play. It's visually stunning, and generally manages to stay managable and not overwhelming. The envrionment speaks in beautiful ways as you move through it. The viewpoint is just the right closeness, it leaves you feeling lost as you explore, but once you learn the paths it doesn't feel clausterphobic. Secrets everywhere, but they're not unfairly hidden (ala The Swapper). And the movement, oh the movement. Soaring, diving, frantically attempting to escape other birds (who are bullies, btw). Finally, the combat. Yes it's there, it's amazing. It's brutal. It's viceral. It's wild. And you'll be elated when you figure it out yourself.\n\nAll these elements combine into one of the best games I've ever play. It's under priced, and worth every money grubbing penny.\n\nAs an aside, I haven't decided if I prefer Mouse or Controller play, but so far I'm sticking to the controller as it's slightly tighter.","April 19, 2014","true","5.0"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","0"

I like it, great astetics and concept, but I feel like the one thing that really makes it a rotten egg is the protagonist. They're too underpowered, and you haft to do some things over and over again if you even want to do it.  All you can lift into the air is the animals, and they never like you. On top of that, the special-looking blue triangles are pretty much useless. It's only a rez @ the spot you died, when you can just fly back to where you were. Pretty animation, though. As I said earlier, none of the animals like you, pretty much everyone wants to bar your way except for the little red and yellow birds. You can't even fight back most of the time, unless you throw them into thorns. Being able to hatch birds dosen't help at all; the buzzards still attack you and the magpies still take your stuff.\n\nIn conclusion, I feel that for most people, this game will eventually send them into a rampage and they'd quit, saying it's too hard. Add some allies or strengthen the protagonist and it might make a decent game, but until then, it's not worth the 10 bucks, unless you like looking at the pretty stuff.","June 11, 2014","false","5.0"," 19 of 31 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","19","31","0","1"

They've created a story, a whole slew of mechanisms to carry the player through the journey, and to allow the traveller, you, to discover in your own time and manner, what has happened, how to change it, and ultimately, how nature itself can surprise us.\n\nIt's a stark contrast from their previous title AYIM (And Yet It Moves), which incidentally if you don't have, why not? - but it's clear this is another fine string to the teams collective bow.

It's smooth, responsive and simple.\n\n+ Most of the text is written in another alphabet (still english though), and you have to collect letter by letter to know the meaning of each one (which is fun and cool). It seems hard at first, but the symbols are somewhat alike the normal alphabet, so in the end you'll be reading it without rellying as much to the side notes with the meaning of each letter.\n\n+ At first, some enemies are a little hard to avoid but all of them are "counterable", so it shouldn't be much of a problem if you try some different things.\n\n+ The world is gorgeous, the sound fx are amazing and even though you flap a lot, it doesn't feel repetitive (aside from the "sing/call" button, which is kind of annoying. Useful, but annoying sometimes)\n\n+ The ending is a piece of art if you read most of the runes. Some people don't get (at all) the ending because they didn't care enough to read the runes.\n\n+ The map is short enough to memorize it, but big enough to glamour your eyes. It doesn't have a map, but it doesn't really need one.\n\n\nCons:\n-  In a controller, you have to press RB and LB  to grab and dive respectivelly, but because you have to grab for long periods of time, it'd be better if it were in the RT button as it is easied and more comfortable to push. (and you can't change it in-game)\n\n-  It's a little hard to understand the lore as a whole if you're lazy to decode and read every single rune in the game, but at least it's simple enough to grasp the idea behind it.","January 24, 2015","true","4.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

This was an interesting style, I've never seen anything like it and I really enjoyed it The controls were very intuitive, easy to understand. The puzzles were also quite simple, from what I've played.\n\nThe game is still in early access, so it's certainly not finished (and I experience a few crashes while playing the game), but it has a lot of potential and I'm looking forward to the full version!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSAYl9XLNVU","January 16, 2014","true","0.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

You get to fly around in the world they created and figure out what you want to do. There's isn't choice: you do the things that progress the "story" or you don't. But how you interact with the creatures in the world (or more specifically, how you exact your revenge on them) is the story you create. The closest exception is the end. I didn't like the ending very much, but maybe I would have liked it more if I'd just walked away earlier.\n\nThe game has encrypted messages that probably convey more of the story. I didn't read many of them. By the end of the game I could read them like a child learns to read and that was an interesting experience, but I didn't desire to go around and find every one. In some ways, I feel like that's the key to the Raetikon experience: you don't need to do everything; you can just spend some time finding out the Secrets of Raetikon.","September 29, 2014","true","3.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

Some things will definitely be different in the future.*\n\nFirstly, this is unlike any early access game I've played. It's actually playable!\n\nThe basic premise behind this game is the following: you're a bird. You're looking for singing rocks that, when you do find one, everything (read: EVERYTHING) wants to mess you up.\nThat is, as far as I can tell, the point of the game. But the funny thing is, this unexplained goal is something I want to achieve when playing. Everything about this game makes me want to play, even when I don't know why.\nThe very well done flying mechanics feel intuitive and, even on the keyboard, I found myself soaring around relatively quickly.\nThe entire atmosphere and art style feel like a children's book mixed with cave paintings mixed with origami. If that doesn't sound awesome, then stop reading right now.\nThe music (note: I am a composer, so my music opinion is much more in depth) is a happier sounding minimalism. Basically expect lots of repetition, constant looping ostinatos and continuous percussion that tend to stick out of the mix. Initially, I was put off by the music to be honest. Minimalism isn't really my thing and hearing the same 4 second melody over and over and over? Well, I was beginning to consider switching off the sound after a while...\nBut it gradually grew on me, especially when I got further into the world. It starts to really come into its own when you meet the more interesting animals. So, I'm passing the music, but would much prefer something more than what's currently available.\nSpeaking of audio, I did notice repetitive sound effects, so I'm hoping the creators decide to invest in more than the handful of rock cracking sounds they have! I also dislike the wind sound that accompanies a dash. That would work a lot better as a speed activation, rather than a button activated sound effect.\n\nSo, the tl:dr version:\n\nPROS:\nBeautiful artstyle\nWonderful atmosphere\nVery polished controls and engine\nWorld is intriguing\n\nCONS:\nMusic can get repetitive and dull over time. Did grow on me though.\nSound effects are obviously few and far between/need to be changed in places\n\nNow, the big question is: is it worth it?\nI would definitely say yes. There's a decent amount to go with already, and it's still early access. If the creators keep it updated and improve upon it, then the answer will be:\nOH GOD YES!\n\nLooking forward to the future of Rætikon.","January 9, 2014","true","2.0"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/stragglerastic/recommended/246680/","stragglerastic","Lagg&","http://steamcommunity.com/id/stragglerastic/","292 products in account","This game started out so good. I was getting ready to have a nice relaxing atmospheric run like Dear Esther but more proactive. It showed some really pretty art and I dropped to the ground and messed around with the controls collecting stuff and poking at the wildlife and enjoying the sights.\n\nThen it all went to ♥♥♥♥. Not only is there no map or fast travel - something which immediately becomes obvious and a big problem when you make your first shard since you have to make a return trip every time you make it and they get longer as the game goes on - but there is also no reliable way to defend yourself. I understand the whole thing about being a non-predatorial bird creature but come on. In nature any bird that can lift animals can pretty efficiently dive bomb them to the ground. Here it sometimes works and sometimes doesn't. Much like the "weapons" and dropping heavy objects on things.\n\nEnemies are not similarly handicapped by any means, they will relentlessly and brutally attack you. Some of them will outright grab you and stop you from moving while mauling you with no means of escape. Apparently the enemies I experienced were the nerfed ones. One can only imagine how they were on initial release.\n\nNow one could easily say "meh, I can handle that." and be absolutely correct. However the biggest issue is that (at least in my playthrough) there is a bug in the positioning of slivers - the things that you build shards with - that make one in particular get placed behind a background object. Making it unreachable without editing your save files. Which is what I did as detailed here so that I could complete the game.\n\nWasn't really worth it in the end though. I normally have a policy of not spoiling in reviews even using spoiler tags, but here it's so pointless I might as well say it. Your reward is a pong game. That's it. This occurs after you smash animals that are in the machine's cages for a blood sacrifice. I don't know if either of those things were an attempt to be "edgy" or philosophical but they failed in both respects. Making it just seem silly.","December 26, 2014","false","2.9"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","58","7","12","2","0"

I love how there is little in way of a tutorial and you are free to interact with the physics and animals of the world. For instance place a male rabbit with a female rabbit and little rabbits appear, giving you a little bonus as well :)\n\nThe feeling and physics of the flying is amazing and feels very lifelike - you can float along on wind currents and flap your wings for speed, swoop and dive.\n\nHighly recommended for anyone looking for an original game experience that is unlike anything else out there!","April 21, 2014","true","11.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Or rather, it might be better to say that the lore is hard to keep in mind when it is there (and is confusing anyway) and the gameplay is just a tad bit wonky enough to be offputting.\n\nThe gameplay loop is more or less: As a bird, explore > find shards > use shards to get crystal > carry crystal back to the start of the game.  This can be a little frustrating due to a lack of map, and the game often has aircurrents and 'invisible' ceilings (just max elevation for your bird to fly) so you cant always expect to be able to take straightforward paths.  Exploration can reward you with an anagram cypher so you can read various runes around the game world on obelisks, but its not really easy to do so because its not automatically translated for you, hence why I said the lore is hard to keep in mind.  Its a lot of mental effort to try to guess out letters without the whole codex.\n\nFinding shards is more or less easy, but the crystal carrying can be a different matter.  The other animals in the world will attack you or steal the crystal from you as you try to carry it back and make you have to chase them down to get it back.  This just feels frustrating and like your time is being wasted, it isn't fun.  The controls are passable, but I never felt like they were amazing and executing the needed moves to chase down elusive enemies or avoid attacks can be a pain.  Gameplay just never felt good.  I only kept playing because I had started playing and presumably was progressing towards finishing.\n\nLore wise?  Was hard to keep in mind when I played the game, but I really can't say I remembered any of it.  I got all but one or two of the needed crystals to roll the credits then just gave up on the game.  I looked up the ending on youtube and it feels like a bit of a rediculous jab by the way of the developer.  Sure it can be interesting to have a joke on the expense of the player but if the other party can't figure out the joke and you dont explain it to them then its not funny or 'deep.'  I just sort of shrug my shoulders at this part, there wasn't enough of a story to be meaningful.\n\nI wouldn't recommend it.","May 10","false","2.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's an exploration game with a bit of action. The assembly of such gfx/music (one is a slow down version of a "the fith element" melody) and gameplay makes this game unique-ish.\n\nUnfortunately, I did discover some game mechanics when I finished the game while I decided to have a look at the steam achievements. The breeding, predator/prey law,  well... I missed them totally. Some of them are insane: finish the game without being hurt is crazy, coze the movement/flapping of the bird will make it extremely hard, namely, you will need luck, a lot.\nI managed to block an underwater rune with rocks... (unable to remove them to read it).\n\nThe ending is controversial: killing animals for their blood in order to power what seems a machine, is a bit too much for me. And I'm not a vegetarian person. And why pong??\nThe game is big enough to discourage to start again to unlock more achievements and to discover what the hell are the 2 unused triangles. I was not able to find a place where they would fit. I really did spend a lot of time looking for forgotten places in the entire world. Well... did not look hard enough... hint of the location not "strong" enough?\n\nOne bad point though: the game require the linux closed source radeon driver for full rendering.

On your free flight around this wonderful world, you happen across various animals. And you can choose to help or not, or even try to find a way past them. The crow seems to like attacking you when you're near a machine, just HOW are you going to get rid of him?? Well, there was that rock, I could try and squish him..\n\nDo you try and fight, try and use world objects, use another animal to your advantage?? It's your call.\n\nI'm still trying to figure out the rune table, but again, this will prove fun more than frustration, and it's all part of the learning curve of playing this game.\n\nThe physics are well rounded (grabbing a heavy rock slows you down etc etc) and the ability to just mess about  is wonderfully delightful. Even though I've played less than an hour, this is going to be one of those games I can quite happily come back to again and again.\n\nI'll have to have a bash at the editor, which is a really nice touch from Broken Rules. Not many game companies give you this option to mess about with their game.\n\nEnd opinion?\n\nWorth £6.00? oh hell yeah.\nGame play? Very smooth, graphically beautiful open world\nRecommend this?

It was, however, a little short. I finished two play throughs and all of the reasonable achievements in about 12 hours. I understand it is an indie game, so I cannot reasonably judge it on length.

Also, there are other stats in that same listing that never seem to change no matter what I do. I could have missed something entirely, or there are bugs.

It's amazing to explore and find the story of the game.  What you thought of Secrets of Raetikon in the beginning might change and blow your mind with the twist of an ending :3  What I loved about this game too was that the puzzles given didn't hold your hand through it.  Though sometimes aggrivating, finishing the puzzle was rewarding because you had to think on your own and come up with your own ideas on how to solve it because there's not just one way to do it!  It's a truly unique game, and one that I personally have not experienced yet. I loved it and I highly recommend it for someone who's looking for a beautiful and challenging adventure.","August 23, 2014","true","5.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

A sort of 2.5D collect-a-thon platformer, without the jumping puzzles. Far from perfect, but would still recommend. The controls are very simple, but very ropey and imprecise. The narrative is non-existant. Quite why you're doing anything, or what exactly it is you've got to do at times is unclear. The game is action-focused, in that you're constantly doing everything you can to avoid action. Three hours long but ends very abruptly. A map is sorely needed.\n\nIn short, everything is kind of okay, but can lead to intense frustration. I would not recommend it as a method to relax. Only buy if you're already a relaxed person, because the controls and enemies will likely annoy you.\n\n7/10, would recommend, but probably won't play again","August 27, 2014","true","3.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/emuholic/recommended/246680/","emuholic","emuholic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/emuholic/","1742 products in account","Secrets of Rætikon is a side-scrolling open world exploration game set in the mountains of the Alps. You play as a bird whose aim is to collect parts of an ancient machine and unlock the mysteries surrounding it.\n\nSecrets of Rætikon is currently available on Steam’s Early Access system. This generally means the game is still in development and can be anything from a barely playable early build to a nearly finished game. Secrets of Rætikon fits in somewhere closer to the latter, it is playable until the last chapter which is not complete, but it will be before launch which is expected in a few months time. There are some bugs and unfinished level designs but you should not have any major issues.\n\nThe game starts with no story or introduction which immediately gives you that mysterious feeling. The story is told throughout the game via rune stones which need to be deciphered. A simple tutorial gets you underway and introduces you to the mechanics of the game.  A game controller is recommended, though you can use a keyboard if you wish. As you are a bird, you fly around the game with some spot on flight controls, they feel very responsive and comfortable to use with a controller. Your bird can glide at a normal speed, flap its wings to give a speed increase and for a fast burst of speed you can dive. Finally, you can interact with the scenery by holding it with your claws, you can pull or push, and even lift if the object is not too heavy.\n\nThe graphic style is probably the first aspect of the game that you notice. It is a 2D side-scrolling game with polygon style graphics which is very striking. The background shows the mountainous ranges in the distance through to dense forest, caves and more. The foreground changes style to reflect the game areas, outside in the windy mountains, maze like forests, dark cave systems and mysterious temple like areas. The definition of the areas made up from the polygons are immediately recognisable and wonderful to look at. The audio is more subtle with short pieces of soft tones which work well, sounds effects are sparse and could do with some more work.\n\nThe population of Rætikon is quite varied, from cute bunnies and butterflies through to not so friendly foes such as blackbirds and wolves. You have no form of attack, but you can use the surrounding scenery to run and hide, avoid or attack, the choice is cleverly up to you. If you choose the latter you can for example pull up thorny plant roots, fly around with them in tow and use them to defend against enemies. Alternatively, you can wait next to a thorny bush as an enemy flies towards you and dash away at the last second, resulting in a satisfying messy end for the foe. There are more devious ways to avoid death but I will leave them for you to work out.\n\nThe game world is open and you are free to explore a good chunk of it from the start. There are some puzzles which need to be solved to progress, usually to access an area containing a machine shard of which there are six. These are unlocked with Slivers which are found throughout the game. Once unlocked, you will often find a fairly simple puzzle such as rebuilding a broken statue with pieces found in the surrounding area. Completion of the puzzle rewards you a shard which you need to take back to the main machine. Beware, the shard is sought after and the local population may chase after you, resulting in a friendly convoy of butterflies or a nerve-racking chase by blackbirds which if they manage to grab the shard will fly around with it until you manage to get it back off them!\n\nSecrets of Rætikon is great fun to play, the pace of the game is for the most part very relaxing and it is enhanced by the open world exploration which allows you to fly around at your leisure and enjoy the scenery if you wish to. The interaction with the scenery and wildlife is enjoyable, just try not to kill those poor innocent bunnies by throwing rocks at them ;) There are a few bugs and unfinished parts of the game but keep in mind this is Early Access and the weekly updates contain a good number of changes and improvements. If you enjoy exploration, solving puzzles and mysteries set in an very atmospheric world this is a game you should not miss out on. Highly recommended!\n\nReview originally posted on http://www.gamergeddon.com/","January 14, 2014","true","3.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

You fly around as a little bird in a world full of dangers: the ferocious lynx, charging hawks, buzzards that will snatch you up and thrust you into deadly thistles. And the meat and potatoes of the game is - exploring. Pulling aside boulders to find out what is behind, collecting mysterious glowing artifacts, and finding out how to avoid or destroy your enemies. Because you don't really have an 'attack' per se, you have to use more creative options to bypass foes. You can utilize thermals (air currents) to pick up incredible speed, suddenly dive mid-air to escape the talons of a foe, or out-wit your opponent and carry him to his doom beneath a rolling rock. Everything in the game reeks of mystery and intrigue, not to mention being /beautifully/ designed in fascinating designs of geometrical components.\n\nBest things in the game: interesting twist on combat, visuals, absorbing mini-puzzles (none very difficult so far), visuals, wonderful sense of atmosphere and believable ecology, great motivation for exploring, and -- did I mention visuals?\n\nDrawbacks: Some of the pursuits can get frustrating (e.g. when a 'magpie' bird steals something important you have to chase it around, the fact that it seems to be faster than you can get annoying).

Art style is interesting, the setting feels awesome, its cool to explore and interact with the world or watch it carry out its own habits like a natural predator and prey feeling.\n\nCons: Certain tasks and the typical issues with physic heavy games may turn off some folks as being a bit tedious, a full game over can erase a lot of well earned progress, and some transparent spots look no different than walls.\n\nOverall its a fantastic and inspiring indie title that isn't quite complete yet but surprisingly well polished and full of content for an early access. I'd say it could do better for user interface or friendlyness, but the gameplay itself is a lot of fun and something special. The slow pacing rewards you for taking your time and really making the most out of the world, and in this sort of way it reminds me of games like Spyro, Okami, or a flash game I played called William and Sly. If you're a fan of any of those, or like a certain range of slow paced adventure or platformers, or just enjoy this concept of flying and physics then I can safely recomend this game to you and I don't think you'll regret getting it.","January 13, 2014","true","5.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Flying about and exploring was engaging, and getting some of the shards back to the central hub had me swearing at birds and trees alike - in a good way, mind you. There were definetely things to like here, enough to justify the five dollars I spent on it during a sale.\n\nThat said, I found myself wishing there were more to explore; more proper secrets to uncover. That, and the game doesn't really do much with it's world; I think the biggest example is the fox tribe. Sure, you can find your way into the obscure location of the den and meet a tribe of foxes, but nothing really comes of the encounter. They just kind of...leave. They're a setpiece, and not much else.\n\nThere's backstory here to find, but no real story to explain the gameplay, which perhaps helps to explain why the ending is so unsatisfying. I'm not even sure what it was properly trying to say. I suspended my disbelief and honestly invested into the world for a few hours, and didn't really feel like I got anything back for the experience. If nothing else, this game has shown me a bad ending can really sour the experience.\n\nStill, the game got me to swear at birds, so it certainly did something right.","August 26, 2014","false","5.8"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wirdjos5/recommended/246680/","wirdjos5","Wirdjos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wirdjos5/","89 products in account","Some stories are helped by a lack of elaboration. Without the whole picture, the audience can hold on to their sense of wonder and use what they do know to speculate in the blanks. Secrets of Raetikon has no such story. It somehow manages to provide those details the audience would normally speculate over without any of the overarching context that should have proceeded it. The runestones scattered around Raetikon begging to be translated but lacking any real depth and the ending that comes out of nowhere and leads to the same place are hints that there was an attempt to add in this context, but sadly, they both miss that mark considerably. Be that as it may, there is a robust and easy to use editing tool which is fully integrated into the game itself. One would think that with such a uniquely beautiful world that is an absolute joy to explore, players would leap at the chance to correct such a damning flaw. But with only four items in the game's Workshop, it seems most, myself included, just let the opportunity pass on by. And it's a shame because the design of world itself is genuinely wonderful. Every part of it is gorgeous and exists independent of the player. The other creatures will gladly attack each other just as readily as they would the player and nothing seems to be artificially constructed for the player to interact with. The entire ecosystem feels authentic and organic. If that's the only game you're interested in playing, ignore my lack of a recommendation because you'll find a game worth your time here. But if you're looking for a conclusion, catharsis, or some sense of reason to the world presented to you and your actions in it, please look elsewhere.","November 10, 2015","false","8.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The game involves playing as a small birdman, and you flap around an open 2D world trying to find golden shards and bring them back to a "machine". Along the way there are plenty of physics puzzles and even the combat is physics based. Predator birds will try to knock you out of the sky but you can defeat them with the environment by either grabbing and throwing them into a thorny bush, grabbing a thorny vine and swinging it into them, or dropping a boulder on their head. It really lets you use your brain to figure out a good tactic and experiment.\n\nAs far as exploration goes the game doesn't disappoint. There are hidden caves everywhere and a few secrets to find that aren't required to complete the game. Along the way you'll find hidden "runes" which will allow you to decipher engraved stones. The messages tend to not be that important and are quite cryptic, but finding al the runes will land you with an achievement anyway. The game clocks in at around 2-3 hours so the world isn't huge by any means, but they've managed to pack quite a lot to explore into it. I would have liked the game to be longer but i reckon the gameplay would have become quite stale eventually.\n\nThe visuals are stunning and the soundtrack works well. This is a very solid game that drives the player with it's sense of mystery and discovery. Unfortunately while the message at the end of the game was one i enjoyed seeing, it wasn't that well written and left a lot of people confused and feelign unfulfilled, myself included. Only after Googling it i understood what was going on. Despite that though the journey itself is a lot of fun and i urge you to grab a copy .","August 19, 2014","true","6.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

You can fly, as one would expect so that adds some nice bits to the gameplay as your movment is not limited by height though there is a limit to how high you may fly before being sent back down to earth. You spend most of your time flying around exploring the game and it has a fun art style, while the music is not memorable it stays at a nice slow pace and never offends. Challenge is low but you can die from birds of prey, the rather nimble lynx and various harzards like water and brambles. The fun of the game is exploring the world so if you like that this is a good game for you, the ending makes no sense but maybe I just didnt read enough the game's lore which is done with runes that you collect so you can read the writting on stones scatterd through out the game. Gameplay is ok you can pick up stuff and thorw it around so that adds some fun pyschics based action, and if you get a secret you can become god bird destroyer of life.

The content can be extended/changed with some workshop mods that make the game significantly easier or head-bangingly more difficult; it's something to keep in mind if you're looking for a game that can fit your needs.\n\nThe main question is, how good are those 2-3 hours of content?\n\nThe lack of any map at all will certainly frustrate some, even if it's done in one comfortable sitting. Thankfully, the game is not confusing and having to remember where to go next won't/shouldn't be an issue.\n\nIt's unfortunately backed with some backtracking and some animals that will attempt to ruin your work or outright kill you. You can kill them using the environment, but it will take some effort.\n\nThe environment can trap you if you're not careful. This is in combination with auto-save, so restarts might be a possibility.\n\nThe sound and level designs are fantastic. You will feel an urge to explore them, run through the trees as you desire, looking for secrets and such, it's well deserving of exploration. There were no noticeable glitches.\n\nThere are a few, side-track things you can do to occupy your time such as hatching animals for your own benefit or killing the rowdier animals. Also, runes and deciphering.\n\nThe ending will leave your opinions going... "back and forth" I should say.\n\nShould you buy this?\n\nIf you like being thrust into worlds and having to figure out the story for yourself, then absolutely. Otherwise, if you're not much for exploration games, games with little/no text, have a phobia of birds, or don't like puzzles, this isn't for you.\n\nThree stars out of five.","September 28, 2014","true","2.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The second area introduces eagles/hawks which either grab your character and divebomb you into spikes or zoom towards you to directly cause damage. There is no way to fight them, so your only option is to madly tap the A button to flap your pathetic wings away.\nThe worst part, though, comes in when you collect the second core and are on your way back to the central area. Remember those peaceful squirrels and semi-peaceful magpie-like birds you saw on your way in? They're a trap. The magpies/squirrels can grab the core away from you, are faster than you unless you really mash that A button, and will actually toss it to each other to keep it out of your reach.\nThat's right.

It's based on the Roman province of Raetia, which used to be located right where I live and in fact the name is still widely used and synonymous with our people. And the game is in fact set in the alps, so there's little confusion as to what is meant. However I'm not sure what the secret that lies here should be because as far as I can tell there isn't one.\n\nI'd like to say that Secrets Of Raetikon is basically a cousin to FEZ, a highly stylized game with beautiful scenery and a gorgeous aesthetic built around collecting small pieces to either advance to the next area or form larger pieces that you need to collect as well to make the ending happen. But the reason I say it's only a cousin and not brother to FEZ is because it's nowhere near as good as FEZ. It's not a bad game per se, all the elements are there and work perfectly fine but what made FEZ interesting to me was the immense creativity put into building this world that seemed so utterly, soul-crushingly lonely in spite of the fact that the whole game looks absolutely awe-inspiring.\n\nSecrets Of Raetikon tries to do similar things with the what I title "alien alphabet", though in this case they're just variations on runes, but it just seems like less effort went into building this world as opposed to FEZ. The game lets you collect runes throughout the game in order to decrypt a variety of messages in the game but A) I never needed to collect the runes because I for one can actually read a couple of variants of Futhark (runic alphabet) and even if you can't, most letters are made similar enough to the modern Latin alphabet that you shouldn't have much trouble deciphering the messages (I had all the letters of the first message decrypted instantly and only needed to wait for other messages to see how the other runes looked to deduce what they stood for) and B) the messages are entirely pointless. They try to paint this ethereal picture of what is happening in the game but unfortunately, there's no story or plot to be found in this game. Again if I may return to FEZ, yes if you just play the game, collect all the cubes and get to the end, you're none the wiser, but that game is chock full of clues as to what this world is about, even though the first messages of that game delivered by the golden cube were a silly joke form Phil Fish, but you had to actually decrypt an entire alien language with no hints given, as well as a numeric system that isn't easily translatable to arabic numbers. Not to mention all the other secrets and absolutely insane puzzles that game features. Secrets Of Raetikon by comparison basically has one puzzle you have to solve about 4 times in the whole game, which is collecting pieces of broken statues and putting them back together in order to unlock something.\n\nAnd it just occurred to me that I haven't even talked about the gameplay yet. You play as a bird and fly around the levels and explore every last corner of the map because there are a variety of hidden sections masked as rock where you can actually fly through, so yeah, the secrets in this game are basically just hidden in plain sight with no thought required. However unlike FEZ, this game actually has other creatures, meaning different animals and not all of them are friendly. To defend yourself from them, you can pick up basically anything, including enemies, so you have ways of dispatching them by picking them up and throwing them into spikes or picking up thorny plants and smacking enemies with them. It's not that easy and it can get annoying at times because whenever you pick up one of the shards you need to bring back to the machine at the hub, all of the animals suddenly go berserk and want to take the shard away from you.\n\nAnother problem is the fact that this game makes you backtrack an enormous amount because the machine isn't located at the center of the world so every time you unlock a new area you can't go there directly from the hub, no the world is basically laid out in linear order from left to right like any regular side-scroller, so to get back from one part, you have to traverse all the previous levels to get back and the lack of a map-screen makes it hard at times to remember where you've already been and if you forgot to do something in one place it can take a while to remember where you have to go to get back to a certain place. Of the 3 hours it took me to beat this game, at least a quarter of that went into running back and forth and looking for level exits.\n\nAnother problem I have is with the ending so spoiler alert:\n\nWhen you bring back shards to the machine, it unveils that it basically consists of cages with animals trapped inside them - the same type of animals you find in the whole game in fact. By the end, you have 7 cages filled with 7 animals and the game makes you kill all the trapped animals since their blood powers the machine, which is grim enough. But once you do and the machine powers up it just zooms into the machine, then the screen imitates an old CRT monitor and you're treated to a version of Pong. And once you lose, it tells you your score at Pong and rolls the credits. There's no closure to this here and once you go back into the game, all the animals have died in the place where they last were so you can now fly through a world filled with corpses.\n\nThere are also two optional shards you can collect but one of them can only be found at the very end when you already almost beat the game, so I'm not sure why they included it. Maybe there's another secret hidden somewhere but once you collect those two you get a special power whereby you can suck everything in the world towards you. Don't know why and I'm not inclined to go back and investigate any more because in the end, I had limited fun with this game.\n\nLike I said, the overall aesthetic of the game is magnificent, but the final execution simply leaves a lot to be desired. I'm usually the guy who likes these artsy pretentious games because they offer something different but in this case I'm really not satisfied with the result. And of course, and I know I sound like a broken record, but $10 for a 3 hour game where you really don't get to do much is simply too expensive. I bought the game somewhere else and paid less than that but I simply cannot recommend this game at full price for what it offers. Which is a shame because I was really looking forward to playing this when I saw gameplay trailers and screenshots.","January 12, 2015","false","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/HappyDnomla/recommended/246680/","HappyDnomla","Firebird","http://steamcommunity.com/id/HappyDnomla/","199 products in account","Raetikon is a short, beautiful, subtly (and dramatically) poignant statement of a game.\nIt is entertaining, but will not deliver any overt sense of accomplishment, even upon completion. I think although maybe a hair off in execution, that is wonderful, but know that your reward will be a series of thoughts and feelings rather than a shot of dopamine and a pat on the back for rescuing the princess or stopping the communists.\n\nIt's similar to Fez in the sense that you're dropped into a world and hinted into completing a quest of collecting things to unlock other things in order to collect more things, all the while exploring and wondering what exactly you're doing, why, and to what end.\n\nThe gameplay however, is unique. You're a bird(man?) and in essence all you can really do is traverse the environment and manipulate it the way a bird would. You flap and fly and dive, and you can grab things to pull or lift or turn them. If you encounter an unfriendly bird, there's no special power with which to thwart it, no aiming and hitting A to attack. If you'd like that bird dead, you'll need to manage to grab it, hold onto it, and fly in a fashion that manages to hurl it into the ground or some hazardous object. Again and again. Plus, animals you kill stay dead, there is no respawning (except for you.) There's something about the difficulty and lack of abstraction of the combat system that really adds to the game's point and feel. Beyond bird on bird crime, you might manipulate the populations of the different areas by returning eggs to their nest to hatch or bringing a pairs of rabbits together, providing additional targets and an advantage for yourself.\n\nBeyond mechanics, exploration is the real name of the game, and it is wonderful to explore. The art is quite cool, the system of animals interacting is fun to observe (and/or disrupt,) plus plenty of fun nooks and hidden passages to find, though none overly difficult. There is no map in the game, but not having one to refer to does a good job of forcing you to focus on your surroundings. The world is also small enough that you'll be able to sort it out in your head with time.\n\nSpeaking of time, you're looking at a 2 - 3 hour game, unless you hit a major snag or bug of some sort. A good romp through the world, ending before the mechanics get stale. The game isn’t particularly difficult, though there are a couple tricky segments. It's probably good for a second playthrough, given some of the things you might discover towards the end of your first, but there is no 'new game+' in the strict sense.\n\nIt’s worth noting that you really ought to play with a controller, and the game can still glitch. The developer is pretty proactive, however, and frequently will personally fix your glitched save file if you bring it up in the forums or email them. I wound up editing my own save file due to a glitch, but was actually able to do so fairly easily and am none too put off by it, though your mileage may vary.\n\nOverall, I think it’s quite the game, and would recommend it, particularly if it’s on sale. If you are looking for an otherwise traditional indie eyecandy platformer, this might not be your cup of tea, but if you have an open mind about games and think you might enjoy flapping around a brightly colored origami ecosystem, you’ll be in for a treat.\n","January 20, 2015","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Astoundingly beautiful, both still and in motion. Both the visuals and sound effects are excellent, the music was very fitting but did not particularly strike me as being memorable.\n2. Smooth flying and generally peaceful exploratory gameplay with the occasional bit of stress when there's a fight you need to waggle out of (you cannot directly attack opponents but need to time grabbing them and/or environment objects to disable them) - there's a caveat mentioned in the bad below.\n3. Interesting puzzles and setting, the story is not explained in depth but enough is said to build your own interpretation\n\nThe bad:\n1. There are some rare bugs involving getting stuck in the environment. You can literally fly almost anywhere there is even a small crack so sometimes you can get stuck but thankfully there is a simple workaround described in the community guides here. This also works for a case I encountered where I had insufficient shards and could not progress as there were no more available in the areas accessible to me (the game was expecting a different completion order) but I got around the problem with said fix.\n2. The ending is both shocking and lackluster, this was supposed to be a trilogy but insufficient sales killed off the sequels so the end here was rushed to a closure. Ignoring this, the mystery of the rest of the game is worth experiencing.\n\nThis is a game for people loving nature, exploration and a good (if somewhat vague) mystery.

There are some hints, so you are not completely lost at what to do, but most of this game is about discovering what you are able to do and what you need to do. I feel like I need to draw a map while playing this game, though, because I have no idea where I am going. I also played for what I felt was a long time and I was getting kind of bored. If you are interested in just being thrown into a game, having no idea what to do, and just figuring it out as you go, then this game is pretty good.

It's based on the Roman province of Raetia, which used to be located right where I live and in fact the name is still widely used and synonymous with our people. And the game is in fact set in the alps, so there's little confusion as to what is meant. However I'm not sure what the secret that lies here should be because as far as I can tell there isn't one.\n\nI'd like to say that Secrets Of Raetikon is basically a cousin to FEZ, a highly stylized game with beautiful scenery and a gorgeous aesthetic built around collecting small pieces to either advance to the next area or form larger pieces that you need to collect as well to make the ending happen. But the reason I say it's only a cousin and not brother to FEZ is because it's nowhere near as good as FEZ. It's not a bad game per se, all the elements are there and work perfectly fine but what made FEZ interesting to me was the immense creativity put into building this world that seemed so utterly, soul-crushingly lonely in spite of the fact that the whole game looks absolutely awe-inspiring.\n\nSecrets Of Raetikon tries to do similar things with the what I title "alien alphabet", though in this case they're just variations on runes, but it just seems like less effort went into building this world as opposed to FEZ. The game lets you collect runes throughout the game in order to decrypt a variety of messages in the game but A) I never needed to collect the runes because I for one can actually read a couple of variants of Futhark (runic alphabet) and even if you can't, most letters are made similar enough to the modern Latin alphabet that you shouldn't have much trouble deciphering the messages (I had all the letters of the first message decrypted instantly and only needed to wait for other messages to see how the other runes looked to deduce what they stood for) and B) the messages are entirely pointless. They try to paint this ethereal picture of what is happening in the game but unfortunately, there's no story or plot to be found in this game. Again if I may return to FEZ, yes if you just play the game, collect all the cubes and get to the end, you're none the wiser, but that game is chock full of clues as to what this world is about, even though the first messages of that game delivered by the golden cube were a silly joke form Phil Fish, but you had to actually decrypt an entire alien language with no hints given, as well as a numeric system that isn't easily translatable to arabic numbers. Not to mention all the other secrets and absolutely insane puzzles that game features. Secrets Of Raetikon by comparison basically has one puzzle you have to solve about 4 times in the whole game, which is collecting pieces of broken statues and putting them back together in order to unlock something.\n\nAnd it just occurred to me that I haven't even talked about the gameplay yet. You play as a bird and fly around the levels and explore every last corner of the map because there are a variety of hidden sections masked as rock where you can actually fly through, so yeah, the secrets in this game are basically just hidden in plain sight with no thought required. However unlike FEZ, this game actually has other creatures, meaning different animals and not all of them are friendly. To defend yourself from them, you can pick up basically anything, including enemies, so you have ways of dispatching them by picking them up and throwing them into spikes or picking up thorny plants and smacking enemies with them. It's not that easy and it can get annoying at times because whenever you pick up one of the shards you need to bring back to the machine at the hub, all of the animals suddenly go berserk and want to take the shard away from you.\n\nAnother problem is the fact that this game makes you backtrack an enormous amount because the machine isn't located at the center of the world so every time you unlock a new area you can't go there directly from the hub, no the world is basically laid out in linear order from left to right like any regular side-scroller, so to get back from one part, you have to traverse all the previous levels to get back and the lack of a map-screen makes it hard at times to remember where you've already been and if you forgot to do something in one place it can take a while to remember where you have to go to get back to a certain place. Of the 3 hours it took me to beat this game, at least a quarter of that went into running back and forth and looking for level exits.\n\nAnother problem I have is with the ending so spoiler alert:\n\nWhen you bring back shards to the machine, it unveils that it basically consists of cages with animals trapped inside them - the same type of animals you find in the whole game in fact. By the end, you have 7 cages filled with 7 animals and the game makes you kill all the trapped animals since their blood powers the machine, which is grim enough. But once you do and the machine powers up it just zooms into the machine, then the screen imitates an old CRT monitor and you're treated to a version of Pong. And once you lose, it tells you your score at Pong and rolls the credits. There's no closure to this here and once you go back into the game, all the animals have died in the place where they last were so you can now fly through a world filled with corpses.\n\nThere are also two optional shards you can collect but one of them can only be found at the very end when you already almost beat the game, so I'm not sure why they included it. Maybe there's another secret hidden somewhere but once you collect those two you get a special power whereby you can suck everything in the world towards you. Don't know why and I'm not inclined to go back and investigate any more because in the end, I had limited fun with this game.\n\nLike I said, the overall aesthetic of the game is magnificent, but the final execution simply leaves a lot to be desired. I'm usually the guy who likes these artsy pretentious games because they offer something different but in this case I'm really not satisfied with the result. And of course, and I know I sound like a broken record, but $10 for a 3 hour game where you really don't get to do much is simply too expensive. I bought the game somewhere else and paid less than that but I simply cannot recommend this game at full price for what it offers. Which is a shame because I was really looking forward to playing this when I saw gameplay trailers and screenshots.","January 12, 2015","false","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can interact with the many wild creatures in the game in various ways; some may attack you - others simply follow you, or alternatively run away from you.  But most importantly, if left to themselves they run around seemingly going about their lives, making the world feel very alive, and not centered on the player, as in many video game worlds.\n\nHowever, I found the gameplay to be primarily frustrating.  The main goal of the game is to pick up all of the little magic yellow bits that are floating throughout the world.  Once you've gotten enough, you can use them to open doors to new areas or unlock one of the seven odd, musical machine pieces, which you need to put into a large machine that you find near the beginning of the game.  Furthermore, while the map is fairly complicated (there are many little tunnels and secret paths), it is also fairly linear on a larger scale.  And you are not provided with a map of any kind, or teleportation, and dying brings you back to the beginning.  You can see where this is going.  I found this game to be pretty difficult (I've heard that the keyboard controls don't work as well as a controller, so maybe that's why), and I died frequently.  I spent by far the majority of my time trekking back and forth between one end of the map and the other.  However, even if you don't die ever, you need to go all the way back to the beginning each time you pick up a new musical machine piece, and then trek all the way back out.  That is basically the whole game; walking down a path, picking up a piece, walking back, putting it in.  Repeat (except the next piece is further away).  Additional gameplay comes from (a) environment exploration, which granted, is very nice, (b) wildlife attacking you, and (c) things trying to grab the musical machine pieces from you.  The latter I found to be extremely annoying, and often so difficult to overcome that I gave up for days or months at a time.  In the end, I actually never got the final musical machine piece back to the machine, and ended up watching the ending on youtube instead.\n\nWhich brings me to the ending.  I won't say what it is, but I will say that it was bad.  The premise of the ending was interesting (after I read what the premise was according to the game makers, because the ending did not convey it at all).  Some elements of the ending were very striking.  But all together, it did not convey it's message and it was confusing as hell.  You really weren't sure if it was over, or if there was something else you were supposed to do to get an ending that made sense, or what.\n\nAnother major shortcoming is that it is possible to back yourself into a corner.  First, it is possible to spend your magic yellow bits in such a way that you won't have enough to open one of the later doors (I think this may be a "bug" that they fixed).  Second, there is a way to get through a certain type of difficult terrain later in the game (don't want to spoil it), but if you drop your tools while doing so, you can get stranded... and there is literally no way to get out, other than editing your save file manually.  This is not like a niche problem either, like this is something you probably will do at least once when you play the game.\n\nOverall, this game is lovely, and the exploration part is strong, but gameplay and quality of life features are lacking.","May 15, 2015","false","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The exploration is neat, but the world is too small. The little puzzles are fun to discover, but don't really go in depth either.\nThe game relies on finding triangles, to turn into a bigger triangles and carry that triangle to the beginning of the game. The other animals act like annoyances in these segments. Especially when there's a flock of birds that steal and toss around the triangle like middle school bullies.\n3 hours is also a bit short, considering how slowly I played through it, and I even got lost for a while to find the final triangle.

Apart from a few tutorial messages explaining the controls, you aren't told anything about what you're expected to do. You will soon find out that you are supposed to collect slivers, which you can turn into crystals at shrines, and then bring the crystals back to your base. During your journey you can collect runes that will help you translate ancient tablets (although it is quite easy to translate them even without getting the runes).  It looks like everything is in place to make this an enjoyable exploration-based experience.\n\nAnd then you start encountering enemies, who promptly show you who is the boss in this forest. Unlike you they have reliable attacks and can move around much more gracefully. Your character has no reliable way of fighting (you can try dropping stuff on your enemies or luring/dragging them into thorns). Evasion won't work 100% of time either, since you seem to have a much clumsier "flight model" than your adversaries, who will often be coming at you from several angles and are about as fast as you (not to mention that you will often be carrying objects, which slow you down considerably). The biggest problems by far are the magpies, who will try to snatch away the crystals you're carrying. It's a nightmare to get the crystal back from them, and to get out of their range before they steal it again truly requires the stars to align. The developer recommends using a controller for this game, but even while using one, I was fuming with anger and frustration. I can't imagine playing this game on a keyboard. The levels seem to be designed with maximum frustration in mind as well, with wind and other obstacles getting into your way just when you need every bit of speed you can muster. It doesn't help that you will have to deal with the same challenges everytime you're backtracking home with a crystal, which makes the game extremely tedious.\n\nAbout halfway through the game I've started thinking about what snarky review I was going to write. I came up with: "Pros: Will make you go out into the woods; Cons: in order to horribly maim and murder woodland creatures and burn it all down." Then came the ending, in which you kill all the animals in the world and use their life force to power a game of Pong. I guess it was designed to make the player feel shocked or ashamed, but it just ended up being cathartic, because the damned magpies and lynxes had it coming. I felt a bit sorry for the foxes, they were super chill.\n\nFortunately, I wasn't furious enough with the woodland creatures to miss the message of the game. The people complaining about the brutality and "senselessness" of the ending  have actually missed it in the most ironically hilarious of ways. See, the animals in real world don't deserve to die nowhere near as much as the vermin in this game, yet we still ravage the Earth and their habitats in order to produce equipment and energy for such banal things like playing videogames. While this probably won't stop me from playing videogames, it also applies to many other human activites, which may seem insignificant by themselves, but cumulatively definitely have an impact on our environment – do we really NEED to burn candles, have fireworks, race cars, etc., when we know what effects it has? It's just a shame that the game nurtures your hatred toward the virtual animals to such a degree that you will more likely be pumping your fists in triumph, rather than contemplating what had just transpired.","December 27, 2015","false","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Because I'm swimming for one minute long, nothing shows me I'm doing something wrong or something bad will append.\n\n* The best adjective about the end of the game is "random".","March 30","false","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I feel like it tries to be two very different games at the same time—an exploration game and a physics-based combat game—and I wish it was just one or the other.\n\nSecond, even as an exploration game, it fails in that the language you are supposed to "decode" is LAUGHABLY EASY TO READ without collecting any of the "glyphs" that are supposed to "enable" you to read it. Very disappointing. I guess they were afraid to make that part of the game challenging, but they thought tons of annoyingly hard combat was fine?? I mean, I don't want to be rude to the developers, but I seriously do not understand the choice here.

It looks great and is accompanied by great music but the fact the lore and its few gameplay features hit the game really hard. All your doing is just repeating the same things over and over again, just in different places. Beautiful different places. The game really died with as the story was basically non-existent and was really hard to follow the parts they force fed to you. I think it's a ok game, borderline bad. You definetely don't want to pick this up at $11, do it when it's on a 70% sale. That's the only condition I'll say it's ok (just barely ok) to buy the game.","June 1","false","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
