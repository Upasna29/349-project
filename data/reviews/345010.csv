I registered in the beginning of 2014, and my adventure started from there.  This game has been unique to me in so many aspects, I really don't have the room in a review to talk about them all.  The sandbox aspects, the fact it's an indie game by basically a one-man-team, or the fact it's the most expansive space-sim I've played to date, bringing back nostalgia of Freelancer.\n\nOne thing that has kept me going is the continuous rise of the community.  Slowly, we had less than five active players for weeks on end.  Then a few dozen in the next months.  Eventually, the game expanded and more players joined, and I really felt the small part of the mysterious galaxy we were all in come alive.  Industry was a boon, mining operations became a thing, and eventually the galactic market was properly being utilized which was surprising to many of us so early on.\n\nI eventually had to take a break to focus on real life, but this game was always great about treating you right.  I could play for 15 minutes or 12 hours a day, didn't matter - I progressed.  I could skip weeks or months at a time, didn't matter, I could start off right where I left off.  It's always been a pleasure seeing the game constantly updated on a daily basis.  It's been even more of a pleasure having a dev who will directly communicate and give his time of day to the players.\n\nI was a skeptic at first, but soon came to truly believe in there being billions of solar systems to explore, everything procedurally generating to be a unique experience every time.  Eventually, players started exploring and graphing charts of planets and moons to settle on.  Then players started constructing gates, expanding the inner systems, and really bringing the heart of the game to life - the reconstruction of the empire of humanity.\n\nIt's been over a year now, and myself and other older vets have watched this game bloom like a beautiful flower, and I'm proud to write such a positive review for it.  I could sit and try to come up with excuses all day long, but I honestly can't, this game has been going in the right direction nonstop, and has never ran out of *ahem* Steam.\n\nIf you want to see what the game looked like a year ago - and my basic introduction to it, check out my youtube channel:  http://www.youtube.com/sinstrite  There are also new videos being uploaded right now, based on my attempt at a Let's Play of the game.  I don't think a Let's Play has been attempted with a game quite like this, so I find it interesting myself how tough it is to actually product the content.\n\nHere are some helpful links!\n\nhttp://www.thespacegame.com - play in the web browser for free\nhttp://forum.thespacegame.com/index.php - the official forums\nhttp://wiki.thespacegame.com/mediawiki/index.php/Main_Page - the official wiki\nhttp://www.facebook.com/TheSpaceGame - the official facebook page\nhttp://thespacegame.uservoice.com/forums/194252-general - vote for player ideas\n\nI really do advise the new player to visit the wiki.  Many veterans have put in a lot of work to build it from the ground up, and even as one of the oldest players I still find myself using it constantly.  Let it be your space-bible.\n\nKeep in mind that you purchased the game for $10.00 and paid another $10.00 for the three months of premium bundled with the purchase.  When you first start, do not use your premium right away, save it for when you will most be able to use it.\n\nPlanetary Premium - $0.99 monthly - You get access to the six other planets to build settlements on.  As a free player you can only access Ceres for grain and Vulcan for Iron.  You will also be able to produce: titanium, carbon, aluminium, meat, fruit, vegetables.  This is very good for expanding your starbase later on which brings us to...\n\nIndustry Premium - $0.99 monthly - Use this to expand your Apollo starbase to 100 rings (600 modules) and really pump out some products with your factories.  You can make a lot of progression this way as a new player, and I highly advise you to get all 100 rings going if you plan on building a colony later on.  This also allows you to use modules above class 5 such as the mining beam, ram scoop, salvage beam, etc.  This really is the best premium to purchase in my opinion.\n\nCombat Premium - $0.99 monthly - If you want to make some credits fighting in Janus A, you want to throw some huge guns on your ship.  With this premium, you can access all weaponry over class 5 which allows you to move to the highest rank, making around 60,000,000 each mission ;)\n\nFor you want-to-be colony builders...  You need Stellar Credits.  Each premium gives you 100 stellar credits a month, so if you have all three premiums going, you get 300 SC a month.  A colony costs 80 a month to upkeep, so you can have three colonies just for having the three premiums.\n\nOSB - Starbases that can be attached to your colony in high orbit.  They costs SC if they are not attached, but are free if they are.\n\nOther acronyms:\n\nMB / ML - Mining Beam, Mining Level\nRS - Ram Scoop\nTS - Trading Skill\nSB - Starbase\nHD - Hyperdrive\nCL - Class\nMD - Module\nSY - Shipyard\nGH - Gas harvesting\nHydro - Hydrogen (used to power ships when hyperjumping)\nMP - Mechanical Parts\nEL - Electronics\nGR / Graph - Graphene (made from carbon)\nSC, SCC, SCoil - Superconducting Coils\nNio - Niobium (mined from Columbite)\nAut - Autunite (gives uranium for contracts)\nSS - Space Station\nKS - Kickstarter\nSteamie - What the players who came in through the Steam purchases are called\nElders - Players that have been around for a year or longer\nVets - Players that have played months before the Steam release\n\nIf I think of more I will add them, and one more thing...\n\n/ignore PLAYERNAME is your best friend.","February 27, 2015","true","026.2"," 151 of 172 people (88%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","88","151","172","8","4"

(you want my money, finish your work)\nHowever, after what I saw during those months I made an exception and took a chance.\nI am happy to say I was not disappointed.\n\nThe good:\n\nThe game is deep and theres plenty to do.\n\nAsteroid mining, trading, build settlements, build a starbase,\nsalvage wrecks, acquire blueprints, research, build spaceships and modules,\ncolonize planets, explore the galaxy (whoa 270 BILLION star systems!), and more.\n\nThink Eve Online without the ganking, drama and "stuff", add a touch of Freelancer you come pretty close.\n(Matter of fact, judging from the chat, there is a good amount of Eve refugees ingame)\n\nThe community is amazing! Most are very helpful and trolls are minimal.\nThe wiki is great and given the complexity of the game, I reference it very often\n\nTwo members have made a number of instructive "youtube" videos\n\nSinstrite\nSinstrite's Channel\n\nWaervyn\nWaervyn's Channel\n\nThe game appears to be a labor of love for the developer.\nHe logs into the game often and interacts with his players.\n\nHe updates very often, on several occasions several in one day.\n(as of this writing its ver 1.3038. yesterday it was 1.3035)\n\nThe game is surprisingly stable, expecially for an Early Access game.\nI may experience 1 or 2 crashes in 6 hours of gameplay.\nFrankly, I had a few full release games I wish were as stable.\n\n\nThe Bad\n\nGraphics (not terrible but sure can't list as good)\n\nThe ingame computer commands.\nPlease don't tell me spaceships are equiped with C-64 era computers.\n\nFrankly, typing and spelling are not my forte and the ol' eyesight isn't what it use to be and not getting any better.

Unless one actually looks at the forms, one could easily get the false impression the game is not properly suported.\n\nI have zero issues with the present business model,\nBUT, at present, I cannot renew my subscription through Steam Wallet.\n\nPaypal is not an option for me and I'm very hesitant to use other methods.\nThere's time yet to get it done but time marches on.\nI believe we "Steamer"s have been good for the game, please make it easy for us to continue to support the game.\n\nThe game impressed me enough to write a review, my first.\nI hope you find it useful.","March 23, 2015","true","198.8"," 74 of 83 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","74","83","3","3"

Her dedication to creating your unique universe is only comparable to the quality friends she keeps and the community services she provides.\n\nYou don't want to show her in public, because her graphics are barely comparable to today's modern woman. But at home, between the bosoms of her cozy universe, she offers you to explore her star systems, to probe her planets, and to sample her soil. With some luck, her riches will open.\n\nShe is so giving, so free from jealousy, that she bridles your constructive manhood need to do more, to please her by sharing her with people who understand her inner beauty. Her happiness is your ambition, to gather her spoils and to share your discovery with others. Your orbital space base and an extended jump gate will drive her to ecstasy.\n\nShe can be complicated as her background knowledge comes from NASA, yet she shares a learning journey of science and physics, with the story of the destruction of humanity and the need to rebuild.  She wants you to be rich with passion and to shape her to your desires. She will remember you as you touch her virgin star systems, prominently etching your name into her universe as you prospect a new facet of her exquisite beauty.\n\nHer attractive secret is her potential to be more than she currently offers. Unseen by other woman you may have experienced, she challenges you every month with new features; a new way to re-discover her warm elegance in a cold universe. Once you look past her mistakes and the silly bugs which make her quirky, she is a passionate lover to your space exploration imagination. She learns from you, gives you enough to satisfy your demands and at the same time, offers a unique gaming experience as she grows.

He's a one man team, true,\nbut if he doesn't have much time why does he waste time in implementing\nnonsense like "Cargo now ejects into crates - these can't be re-captured but\nthey're fun to kick around". This nonsense while there are lack of many\nfundamental functions like a decent in game chat or the ability to change\nthe game login password!!!\n\n2) the developer is too self centered in developing features he likes\nthe way he wants without listening to the community.\nTake as an example the npc traders: they trade whatever they like at\nthe price they like and get only half of the goods you've in a stock market.\nNot to mention the stock markets are opened to anyone and you cannot implement\nyour own close loops.\nThis kind of implementation is nice only in the developer's mind!\n\n3) the game learning curve is scary! Forget to log in the game and have\nevreything you need to learn or to do right in one place: in the game itself!\nYou have to read pages and pages of wiki and forum and even after that you\nwill need plenty of help from many experienced players.\nIf you don't have too much time you play OR you spend hours reading poems\nabout learning HOW to play.\n\n4) the in game chat is a joke... there is only one global room and nothing more.\nNo trade chat, no private chats, no personal chats, no messaging system between\nplayers. Something you would expect from day 1 from any game developed in this age.\nThere is barely an ignore feature, too bad it gets reset evrey time you log out.\nVERY useful!!!\n\n5) The interface is ugly and ludicrous. There are tons of textbooks explaining how\nto properly develop a nice basic game interface, but the developer is too busy\ndeveloping useless features like the cargo crates mentioned in point 1).\n\n6) The game is gradually becoming a pay2win kind of game. Recently the developer added\ntwo addons to the game: the bowhead and the hawk. If you don't pay you can't have them\nand they cost more than the game itself, which is utterly ludicrous.\n\n7) The game mechanics are grind galore. To make money there are basically two ways:\nkeeping hauling goods from point A to point B or to mine asteroids. The hauling part\nis especially boring because doing the same set of actions hundreds of times per day\nevrey day cause alienation in one's mind.\n\n8) the game is open ended, but in the sense it doesn't have any purpose after a certain\nstage. At the beginning you keep grinding to become bigger and bigger. After you have\nreached the top, meaning biggest ship and some colonies, you don't have nothing to do\nbasically. I don't like games which tell me what to do in a strict way, but mechanics\nto keep me busy at evrey stage of my gameplay are essential to keep my interest up.\n\n9) To extend further point 8) one of the best game mechanics would be npc space pirates\nattacking colonies and/or trading ships. Too bad the developer will implement this feature\nin his usual self-centered way: the npc pirates will be enabled/disabled using a checkbox...\nWho in the hell would enable such checkbox is beyond me!\n\n10) When there is too much noise about the way a feature is implemented the developer just\ncloses the threads in forum telling "this isn't up for debate" and that's it. What's the point\nof having a forum? To exploit experienced players' knowledge to compensate the lack of any kind\nof decent tutorial/help in the game itself of course.\n\nConclusion: Stay away from this game. There are much better options out there, better priced too!","August 19, 2015","false","106.6"," 90 of 117 people (77%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","77","90","117","7","8"

This game is amazing on so many levels. It's well worth the $20.\n\nThere are some caveats however that are worth noting to those thinking about purchasing.\nThe game purchase will get you most of the features in the game except for full colonies. To have full colonies you will need to have a premium account. For all three premium features it costs $3 a month. The point to the premium is to help support the cost of running the servers. Without premium you'll also only have access to one space station ring, with premium you get up to 100. When you purchase the game you will get a 3 month trial of the premium service so you can try out colony building if you so desire.\n\nEven with the above caveat this is still not a pay to win game. You don't need to have premium to have a full immersive experience of the game. Here's a list of the pro's/cons of the game:\n\nOverall rating 9/10\n\n+Huge universe with 270 billion star systems with only a handful having been discovered so far.\n+A very friendly and helpful community\n+Fast space travel (seriously fast autopiloting system & warp gates)\n+Resource harvesting including asteroid mining, gas harvesting by skimming gas giants, colonies that mine resources\n+Smooth stable game play client & server (In over 40hrs of playing I have had the client crash once and almost no lag or latency issues)\n+Developer that logs into the server and gets input from his players!\n+Good tutorial that isn't overbearing (think breadcrumbs)\n+Good selection of ships that aren't too difficult or time consuming to get.\n\n-Registration is a tad confusing for new players and is on the list to be reworked/fixed\n-Graphics are not the best compared to other games out there however with graphics at max it still looks amazing\n-Need premium to access colonies (as noted above)\n\nSome special notes:\nMining: Mining is not the boring thing I've experienced in most space games where you just find the rocks and shoot them to harvest. In this game the different asteroids have different compositions yielding different minerals/metals. Also the asteroid fields move, so the rocks don't just float in space. You have to match speeds with them and carefully fire your mining laser. The idea is to heat up the rock to a certain temperature to yield the materials. Too cold and it doesn't work, too hot and the rock explodes yielding you nothing. So, you have to pay attention to your mining beam and shut it off at the right time. Also, the range of each class of beam is different, at first you have to get within 1,000 meters to mine an asteroid.\n\nTrading: The game has a very well thought out trade infrastructure and system. Each of the core systems has a NPC Space Station that has a local market where you can sell goods & materials. Each station also specializes in producing one material for sale. Each core station also has a contract board where npc's offer contracts for needed items, passenger ferrying, blueprints for sale (for colonies & player stations), specialized colony supplies/materials, package deliveries etc. The contract board changes every hour, :15 after and :45 after the hour. The Galactic Market (or player market) is where players can offer goods for sale across the whole galaxy that can be searched from anywhere then when bought players have to travel to the selling location to pick up the goods. Also player colonies have stock markets where player harvested goods are bought and sold. With a little bit of time and help from the players you can make a lot of money trading on player stock markets or selling mined goods to colonies.\n\nWarp gates: outside the core 8 systems traveling requires a hyperdrive that burns hydrogen. So if you want to explore you will need those things and have some good skill in gas giant skimming. Also over the last several months several of the colonies just outside of the core 8 have developed into core systems and have built their own warp gates to the core systems. There are several gates being built now (requiring huge amounts of resources) these could be opportunites for traders and miners alike providing the resources for such gates. Also if one were to invest enough time and resources into a new system they could build their own gates to and from the core systems making player trading more viable and cost efficient.\n","February 28, 2015","true","174.2"," 49 of 58 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","49","58","0","0"

It is still early access, but it is my opinion that the direction of the game is going in such a way that a negative review was needed as a warning for future purchasers. If there was a "neutral" button for the review I would have used it.\n\nUser Interface\nThe game’s user interface is horrid.  You will notice it the minute you hit the startup screen.  Instead of a login and character selection screen it has a button series that looks like a single player game, up to and including a “LOAD” button.  Fitting ship modules is a complex and clucky text selector box maneuver.\n\nCommunity\nThe community is friendly, and will answer basic questions in game chat. There is only one “global” game chat, and no in-game guilds or other such mmo “norms”.\n\nGraphics\nThe game uses stock Unity graphics for the most part. The ships and starbases may have been a unity resource pack purchase. The game had a kickstarter specifically to add ship graphics, but everything else is very simplistic.  Planets are little more than a multicolored globe and your character avatar is a guy in a tee shirt and jeans. Still early access.\n\nPlayer Cooperation\nThe game might as well be single player. Your “cooperation” with other players will be limited to buying stuff from them off a market board.  Even such grand ventures such as building a new jump gate basically boils down to hauling loads of minerals.  There is no “grouping” for combat, no sharing ownership or access to buildings, no real reason for other players to be in the game aside from a chat based social and game-economy aspect.\n\nShip Design\nEach ship “class” is just a different skin.  The only technical difference between the base ship “skins”  is that each class increase basically doubles the cargo space. There is a marginal difference in turning, but basically the only real game mechanic-based difference in the ships would be cargo space.  A higher level ship can equip higher level modules, such as a better mining laser.\n\nGrindy and Repetative\nAscent is extremely grindy. You will buy and sell resources via NPC contracts, or buy and sell resources for other players, or mine.  Your ships cargo is the only limiter, when you purchase a new ship you gain more cargo space, thus the grind starts anew for the next ship.  You will also need to grind to purchase blueprints, planet plot deeds, and a hyperdrive.\n\nExploration\nThis seems like a fun concept, and the developer brags about 300 billion star systems; however, you need cargo space to carry fuel for the hyperjump so you will need to grind a lot of money to purchase a decent sized ship and hyperdrive (ships on the NPC market do not come with them).  The ship’s hyperdrive allows you to explore and discover new star systems; however, they get more expensive the larger your ship is (almost always being the same price as the ship itself).\nFor a game that brags about exploration, they sure do make it hard.\nAlso, you get a star system named after you just for being the first person to jump to it. No real planet exploration is required.  Basically, you are getting credit for a "discovery" that was already made by some guy with a telescope years before.\n\nPay To Win\nThe kickstarter crowd got a free ship called a “bowhead”.  Biggest and best ship in the game, nothing even comes close.  The kickstarter players that have a bowhead basically played the game in EZ mode. They didn’t have to worry about cargo spaces on starter ships, the skipped it. This provided the kickstarter crowd with a massive, and in my opinion, game-breaking advantage.\nOne of the kickstarter “options” also provided a planet terraformer, once again something that only the kickstarter crowd got.\nThose who paid the developer got a massive game advantage.  This is a gamebreaking advantage due to the fact that a ship's  cargo space determines how much money can be made ... and how much fuel the ship can carry to jump to and explore other systems.\n\nComplex\nThe game has a steep learning curve. I did not mind this too much, but it is worth mentioning.  You will be doing a lot of wiki research and youtube video watching.\n","May 14, 2015","false","72.0"," 79 of 106 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","79","106","0","2"

The game is very immersive. Asteroids orbit around planets, you can land on planets to build things there, the crafting system is very complex and interesting, and you can even build your own space station which you can expand with many different kind of modules.\n\nPros:\n- Very immersive environments. The space art is very nice and the planets look cool. Asteroid fields feel 'alive' with a lot of movement.\n- Great mining system. Mining is terribly boring in EVE, X, Elite Dangerous and Starpoint Gemini. However, here the mining is spiced up due to two facts:\n1) the asteroids have their own speed and your mining beam only has a 1km range, so you need to keep up with it (or fly very close to it)\n2) The amount you mine is dependent on the temperature of your mining beam. Beam too little and your yield is bad. Beam too much and you get nothing at all!\n- 250 billion systems to explore, that get named after you if you find them first! These systems can contain planets, which you can do geological research on to find out what it offers in terms of minerals etc. Other people (and you) can then colonize these planets, building factories etc. on them to profit from this planet.\n- Player-made economy! Everything except for the most basic resources are farmed/mined/made by the players to sell on the market!\n- You have to work for your things, and feel accomplished after you get a new ship or some other nice thing. Some people might mistake this for grindyness, which I wouldn't agree with (this comes from a person that absolutely despises 'daily quests' etc.).\n\nCons:\n- some people dislike the graphics. I must say, when you're playing it, I think it looks gorgeous. Yes, the shipmodels are undetailed, but somehow they still look nice when you play it. But then again, I never cared for graphics that much (love Dwarf Fortress for example), so I might not be the right person to ask\n- complicated at times. If you want to play this game, you'll have to be ok with reading up on the wiki. While features are being added, things like ejecting cargo is done at the moment through a command console. I expect buttons for this will be made at some point, but they're not implemented yet (you can program in keybinds to eject cargo etc. though, but for this you need to read up).\n\nAll in all, I'm in love.

First I want to address the most common complaints:\n\na) It's pay to win? The DLC Bowhead certainly gives you a lot of cargo space with which to make money, since the game doesn't lock ship size to any player stat other than affordability. But the game has access to bigger ships than the Bowhead, all without the DLC. Making credits is ridiculously easy. I have the next ship in size to the DLC one, the Archon, and could have an even bigger one if that's what I chose to focus on. That's after 2 weeks play.\n\nb) hidden subscription? The game does tell you that the $20 current purchase price includes 3 weeks of premium. Not having premium does restrict what class weapon you can mount (meaning you mount more, smaller weapons) and other restrictions. But the sub price is 1, 2, or 3 dollars a month depending on what you want to do in game. Really, I spend that much daily on coffee. Ever since I've been playing MMO's I've been used to $15 a month subscrptions, and that seems fair.\n\nAbout the positives- love the depth of the game. The longer you play the more you realize there is a lot out there to do, and to learn, and to build! I even tried combat route, which isn't my forte, and found it interesting. There are updates coming to the UI and the combat system. Me, I love the building starbases and colonies aspect of the game.\n\nIt's crazy interactive. Take mining for example. Find the right asteroid, match speed and direction of travel, open up your mining beam and heat it up to the precise temperature- less and you reduce the yield, more and you might explode it. All while moving! Swap out ship modules to optimize the ship to your playstyle, balancing space vs utility.\n\nIt's.. huge. At my stage of the game I look at the systems far away waiting for me to investigate... and procedurally generated space means there will be more when I get there, generated as I arrive- named after the discoverer! That is still a month away game wise for me.\n\nThe dev is extremely involved, and very positive. Check the game forums, won't cost you anything, and see the bug reports and the actions taken. The community is extremely helpful, in advice as well as hands-up, and will steer you right. They are eager to make the game as good as it can me.\n\nHey, this is where I spend my free time. IF you like social interaction, building, mining, combat, this is it. If you prefer to play with cooperative players and away from player harrasment, this is definitely the place.","March 24","true","140.2"," 46 of 58 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","46","58","0","0"

Granted I've played for about 4 hours as of writing this, but I have the graphics maxed out and have not experienced a single crash. The game could be a bit better optimized, but I wouldn't expect that at this stage. There's a few little strange graphical glitches but nothing game breaking. For example, if you buy a new ship your UI doesn't reflect the new stats unless you go back to the Main Menu and then load the map again.\n\nOn that note, this reminds me of Eve. It's a massive grind to get good progress and the game is insanely overwhelming; however UNLIKE Eve, you can get a solid grasp on the game within a couple of hours and it's all easy from then on. If you have questions, the community is very nice and mature and is always willing to help you.\n\nSo far I haven't had the opportunity to build anything yet, the few hours seem to be all about delivering goods and giving people rides to other space stations so you can earn anough credits to buy bigger ships. I haven't even touched the surface of the game and so far it's pretty impressive.\n\nIt's about as intuitive as you can get for such a massive scale space MMO. Until my view of this game changes, this post will reflect my current opinion.  An excellent game with a very active developer.","February 28, 2015","true","16.9"," 43 of 54 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","43","54","0","1"

I honestly really like it and will keep playing, but it has at least a couple big problems that I will deal with for the moment considering it's still early access but it would be a joke if they weren't addressed before the official launch.  It pains me to give a thumbs-down but I will definitely change it if they work on these areas.\n\n\n1.  The Starship Computers:\n\nHoly Carap!  I don't know if it is meant to be somehow more gritty and "realistic" or if it is just a placeholder until someone gets around to making a menu and/or GUI interface.\n\nThe current situation involves a command console type interface (think DOS or UNIX) to interrogate the computer for a lot of important information and functions especially when it comes to exploration.  It takes like 40 keystrokes to do what should be done in 4.  In terms of gritty it doesn't get much better than this but in terms of realism I think in an age of faster than light travel they would have a post-Apollo interface for their computer systems.  Getting to the point of making your own probes and figuring out what all the data means is hard enough...having to beat the info out of the computer is just plain unnecessary.  They certainly don't have to dump the console for people who want to think they are computer scientists, but a more user friendly option should be available for the rest of us living in the 21st century.\n\n\n2.  Chat Channel:\n\n...as in singular chat channel for the whole universe.\n\nNo trade chat, no private chat...group or otherwise, no in game e-mail system....Wow!  You'd think that kind of stuff would be in any MMO on day 1.\n\n\n3.  Galactic Market (player auction house)\n\nApparently the galactic market computer system is much more advanced than the on board ship computers because at least you don't have to shop via command console LOL.\n\n...but...\n\nThe only way to search items is by keyword, quantity, and price point.  Also, only 1 page can be displayed so if there are more results that you want to see you have to narrow your search to get them on the first page.\n\n\nThe Good:\n\n1.   Friendly Community\n\n2.  Working Economy\n\n3.  Not overly buggy or crashy\n\n4. Generally playable and fun\n\n5.

Since then I have played for hours on end and had a blast. The gameplay itself is fun, with a decent range of activities to entertain the average player (mining, ai pirate battles, colonization, and exploration), but the true appeal is the future possibilities.\n\nThe game is primairly created by a one man team, who has thus far created day to day updates and bug fixes, constantly adding on to his creation. With a sand box of 270 billion galaxy's to explore and limitless opertunities to add new things it will greatly improve over time from its already fantastic foundation.\n\nI have dabbled with Eve online, but always wanted to directly control my ships.

(The best part about this is that the Premium time from buying on Steam isn't immediately applied to your account, you can activate it whenever you feel you're ready to start using Premium features). After that, Premium is priced on what features you want to use - managing colonies on planets in the Inner Systems, managing large-scale Industry, and taking part in combat are all counted separately, so if, like me, you plan on mostly running a manufacturing operation, you can pay just $1 a month and still enjoy what the game's got to offer for you. Personally speaking, I'm planning on going the full $3 a month anyways, this developer can definitely use the support!\n\nAs far as space games go, I've been looking for one that allows me to participate in trade and industry in a non-combative manner, and I've gotta say Ascent so far has pushed all of the right buttons! Think of a large galaxy and a player-run economy like in EVE Online, except entirely PVE, so there's no need to worry about more experienced players rolling by and ruining your fun.\n\nQuite the opposite, the community has been super helpful for me so far, and I've gotta say I appreciate that kind of spirit!\n\nThe controls for flight are simple but not overly so - You can navigate between gates and stations using just the mouse, and flying your ship in combat uses the WASD keys to pretty solid effect.\n\nThe mining in the game also feels just right - No sitting around like in EVE, and no chasing asteroid chunks like in Elite Dangerous, but you have to match the speed of the asteroid to get a good bead on it, and then use your mining laser to heat it up to just the right temperature to get the best yield out of it.\n\nI'm still just getting started with regards to building colonies and space stations in the game, but I really like what's been done so far! There are still some minor issues regarding framerate and loading screens, but the developers have been super active and engage the playerbase on a frequent basis, so I'd say even if you decide not to buy the game today, definitely keep a close eye on it!","April 13","true","15.2"," 22 of 26 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","22","26","0","1"

Then you probably shouldn't be thinking about buying a new game to begin with..\n- There are bugs of course, it's still a new game - The dev is VERY active in game, forums and steam discussions.\n- If you can't do X because of X then make sure to use the ingame chat (see neg review about fitting modules to ships, I had same "issue" but chat told me how to do it in less than 30 seconds) it's probably not the game, just you overlooking something\n- GRAPHICS are getting improved eventually, they know they suck, but they are coming along slowly\n\nFinally have time to actually write something about the game so here goes.\n\nMost of you have probably played EVE or something similar so if you have you will instantly fall in love with the game. At the minute the graphics are below par but the dev has officially said the HUD and graphics are next on the priority list to sort out so stay tuned!\n\nThe gameplay is brilliant, it's immersive regardless of the poor (I say poor, but comparing something to EVE anything looks poor) graphics, you are not just sent out to right click an astroid until your cargo hold is full. Mining actually means finding astroids that move and not just float there waiting to be camped for hours, same with the gas, you work to "mine" and feels like you are doing something instead of just going afk waiting for materials.\n\nThe building system I don't have much experiance with, I believe my grain farm has just been completed, it seems simple enough and looking forward to building more, generating materials and suppling people with the mats.\n\nJumps gates come in very hand, theres a map with a basic bookmark feature at the minute so if you find somewhere good make sure to bookmark it! Everything is player made so if you want to go deeper help each other out and build new gates to go exploring the VAST world.\n\nThe community are extremely helpful, it started with a small bunch of people in love with the game and are enjoying the influx of new players, very welcoming and always willing to answer questions, provide assistance and more.\n\nA few bugs to iron out, a few changes here and there but with the dev as active as he is I have no doubt it won't be long before this is a lovely polished game with a huge huge community.\n\nCheck the game out on www.thespacegame.com","March 1, 2015","true","46.8"," 31 of 42 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","31","42","0","0"

Outside of the initial tutorial (Which covers all the basics of the game), nothing is necessary to complete to progress in the game how you want (Even the story missions are optional).\n\nDo you want to make your fortune by travelling to distance systems and mining rich resources? Or, would you rather spend time jumping to systems 100's of light years out from the inner 9 systems and discovering what new worlds the procedural generated engine generates (Which can be marvels to behold, including purple methane oceans)? Or, take on the pirates of the universe and help clean-up the troubles in Janus-A on behalf of the UAE? Or, buy up all the resources available and become an industrial manufacturing mogul? Or, colonise remote systems and begin harvesting raw materials to sell back to other players?\n\nOn top of the sandbox approach to this game, the other main strength is how the player base has shaped and expanded on the game. Not only is the economy in the game driven by the players (Pro tip: sell all mined Niobium and Tin to players and not NPC's), the players are also deriving their own content and expanding the known galaxy beyond the inner 9 star systems. From building remote colonies and star bases through to jump-gates to remote systems to connect remote colonies to the inner 9 without the need to use a hyperdrive, the player base and its strength will be what keeps the content generation going for a long time to come. Also, there is a democracy at play where players have the ability to vote for their president, as well as senators of star systems, governors of planets and even mayors of colonies.\n\nLastly, a lot of the content in the game doesn't require you to be online to achieve. For example, colony builds will occur within a period of 24 hours (Usually), which happens even if you are offline. This also applies to any manufacturing or production you currently have at your colonies or star bases. This means that if you ever take a break for a couple of days, or have limited time to play, everything you have will keep manufacturing/producing without you.\n\nAscent already has a lot of content to keep casual and hardcore players alike interested for a long time and with the up-and-coming features (Such as PvP and larger ships) it will only get bigger and better over time. Well worth the small monthly fee + initial purchase price.","March 2, 2015","true","482.3"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","16","19","0","0"

It combines an open universe, resource manangement, exploration, and a little combat. The free content in the game is limited though.\n\nThe universe is a PVE environment so there is no worry about end gamers getting board and one shotting the little newbe's, like happons in EVE online a good deal. The non-hostile world is very relaxing, you travel, mine astroids, manage your holdings, make money, spend more money, make upgrades with little to stress you out.\nYou can do anything in game you want, although you really can't get away from mining, at least not until later in the game when you own a lot of production, and even then the late game is when mining is most productive.\n\nMaking money can be be easy most of the time, you can take contracts to buy and sell goods, deliver people to other places, but mining tends to best for time verses money.  There are 2 main astroid belts in the core systems, the roid respawn rate is good but there is usually an over abundence of people in the belts competing for the good ones.  Its best to get out of the core systems to make mining less crowded, though early game your mining with suck too much to make the long hauls worth while. You will be able to buy plots of land on the core planets and set up resource gathering, each core planet supports a different resource type. These plots take a lot of time, money, resources, and planning to get set up. Its best to reseach this aspect of the game before blindly dropping buildings down. Same applys to your first space station, early game the only thing your spacestation dose i suck you dry of money and materials. One day mine will make things but for now i have spent a weekend marathon gathering what i need to make the 6 buildings its supports, it will likly be another week or so before it produces anything.\n\nThe combat is clunky early game, later when you have access to turrets and broadsides it might be better but i am not there yet. There is only 1 location at this time where you can fight, and have to start missions to get the enemys to spawn. There are no hostile forces anywhere except that one system, and you cannot run into them accidentally. So thats nice in many ways, though i would not mind a couple of pirate systems where there is more combat to be had.\n\nThe game is a grind, its take a good deal of time and resources to get anything done, but your ability to procure stuff tends to scale with you as you progress in the game. For example early game the idea of mining 1000 ore for a project is brutal but later in the game you can mine that and more off 1 astroid.\n\nThe community does not seem overly large but is generally helpful. At this time there tends to be a good amount of "help the new guys" mentalitly out there, it's not uncommon for someone to sell you their ship cheaply when they get a new one. The market however is driven by the players and in the week i have been playing has been driving to rather insane levels. In the first few days of the game for me one of the ships i wanted was running around 100k, a good grind for my skill level and equipment. Now after only a week the average price for the same ship is hovering around 1mil. The ship is not worth half that but thats the nature of these games.  You have to be patient when buying and wait for good deals or just suck it up and pay ripeoff prices. Late game vehicles are a different story, the price tag can hit the billions mark but for the time and resources thay take its understandable.\n\nYou must watch ship your buying, there are real A-holes out there who can ripe you off, a ship must have every peice of equipment on it to leave space dock, (with the exception of weapons and hyperdrives). There are people out there who will look at the average price of the ships of that type and put one up for sale very cheaply, many people seeing the low cost buy it up quickly thinking they got a good deal. When you click on a ship in the galactic market watch out for a red warning at the bottom of the ship data, the warning will tell you and ship cannot fly becuase its missing a piece or peices of equipment. If it something like a mining laser or armor its no big deal and you can take those off your current ship. if the item is a ship teir specific item like a reactor the ship is junk. Most of the ships systems have to match the level of that ship, so you cannot take stuff form a smaller ship to put on it. At this time you cannot sell ships to the AI only to other players, so once you upgrade you leave your old ship where ever you picked up the new one at. There is not a way to bring all your ships to one location so a common tactic, once you have a space station running, is to part at your station, build a shuttle and take the shuttle to pick up your new baby.\n\nThere are a number of things that annoy new players, the tutorials can be a little vague and do not explain what to do clearly much of the time, those of us to game a lot get through them fine but many flood chat with the same questions over and over. You are frequently told to go to the Wiki or check online, i find both those lacking. Much of the time you will not find the information you need online or on the wiki.....(least not on google seachs anyway)(anyone know of a real seach engine so i can stop the google uselessness).\n\nThe game is only arond $20, it also offers a subscription. If your going to play this game seriously your going to need to pay.  For Non-prem players you can own anyship you can buy or build, but are limited to Class 5 equipment (Equipment goes to class 12 i think). You can buy and use higher class equipment but it will only function as class 5. Mining at class 5 is good for early to mid game but for end game needs will not cut it. Your starbase is limited to 6 buildings without premium, once again good enough for early game but not acceptable for late game unless you like projects taking several real world months to complete. You cannot make colonies in the outer systems unless you have premium. So there is a lot of pay to get anywhere in this game.  At this time there are no micro transactions though, you can't buy ships, resourced and such with real money, all has to be aquired in-game with in-game money. I guess this game is larger an MMO of sorts.\n\nI like the game but have already started making spreadsheet and such to manage my small and pathentic empire, so yes the game is already becoming work. I have not decided if i want to pay the subscription or not and thus contiune playing. But at the point i am at in game the lack of premuim is not hurting me yet, one more ship upgrade and i will have to make the money decision though.","March 9, 2015","true","31.4"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","16","19","0","0"

There is stuff you can buy, but the top tier stuff you have to get by earning it...or building it yourself. Meanwhile, as a free player, there's a lot you have to do: mining, settlement building, space station building, wreck salvaging, trading, and so on. My best advice is use the help function (the question mark at the top middle-left of your screen), the wiki, and the help chat and you will muddle through to competence in the various endeavors in about 8 to 10 hours.\n\nOne thing I really appreciate (and the gankers from Eve looking for fresh blood hate) is that there is no PvP, at least not yet, and the PvE is optional. You are free to mine and build and colonize in relative peace.

What a ride! First off, everyone has a different reason for playing these types of games, and for the most part this game should satisfy an itch whether it's in trading, crafting/production, economies, exploring, discoveries, colony building, and much more.  The emphasis is PVE, but there will be a PvP component in the future.  But I really want to discuss my play this past month.\nI am one of those guys that enjoy the journey, rather then the destination.  And this game hits my spot.  Yes, the beginning is tough when you start on a small ship and 1,000 credits and you hear people on chat talking about millions and billions of credits.  But I decided at the very start that I would invest on a foundation to support future play.  I did the early quests, and settled on the inner 8 planets.  As I did this I slowly raised my ship level.  In my style of play I did not use chat to beg and cajole people to give me ships or money to move along quickly.  I had watched Sinstrite's videos before playing and then looked a little at the wiki, so I had an idea what to expect.  After my 8 settlements I built my ISB (Inner Starbase).  It has 100 rings but I found that I only needed 60 or so to be productive.  I scanned dozens and dozens of wrecks and claimed many blueprint fragments for higher level ships.\nSo where am I today?  I am still in a Mammoth, and not a Seraph, which is a much bigger ship, but I am fine with that.  Amazingly, I have already built 5 Mammoths in my shipyard which I sell to other players.  I have built my first colony and outside starbase (OSB) so now I have two shipyards working, increasing my production effort.  My colony is growing, and I am looking through the 100 new systems I discovered myself to find a suitable second colony.\nThe game keeps going.  It is what you make of it.  The people in the game are extremely helpful.  Hey, if you want someone to give you a leg up with a better ship and credits you could probably fine someone, and there is nothing wrong with that.  This game has something for everyone. This economy is player driver for the most part.\nI heartily recommend this game.  If you see me, wabasco, in game.. give a shout!","March 31, 2015","true","333.9"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","15","18","2","0"

Biggest and best ship in the game, nothing even comes close. The kickstarter players that have a bowhead basically played the game in EZ mode. They didn’t have to worry about cargo spaces on starter ships, the skipped it. This provided the kickstarter crowd with a massive, and in my opinion, game-breaking advantage.\nOne of the kickstarter “options” also provided a planet terraformer, once again something that only the kickstarter crowd got.\nThose who paid the developer got a massive game advantage. This is a gamebreaking advantage due to the fact that a ship's cargo space determines how much money can be made ... and how much fuel the ship can carry to jump to and explore other systems."\n\n===================================================================\nMy Response:\n===================================================================\nFor starters when the kickstarter crowd go their bowheads, there still weren't Hyperdrives for it (had to be researched up to get towards them), there weren't massive colonies supplying every resource you could possibly think of, so asteroids had to be mined for all the resources that were needed for mass colony production.\n\nIn regards to the terraforming devices, they are in no way pay to win, as anyone can use those planets for their own colonies.  Terraforming devices gave us ALL the ability to have colonies without the need of environmental domes all over.\n\n===================================================================\n--New Thoughts--\n===================================================================\nI've got almost 1200 hours into this game, and I feel that that numbers only going to go higher and higher.  I have over 300 titles on steam, and this is the first game I've actually broken 1000 hours on.  There have been many improvements to this game such as updated effects in colony construction that make it easier to track the buildings you are placing.\n\nAn updated chat system has been added that allow the creation of our own channels, as well as a help, a trade, and a global channel.  Smuggling has been implemented which can be quite fun, but is only meaningful for newer players at the moment.\n\nCo-op combat and the combat rework will be coming soon.\n\nEconomy Balance has been brought into the game through an elected President roll allowing the modification of what colonies will purchase minerals at, approving gates to the inner 9 systems etc. A few people have put negative reviews up here because of the nerf to carbon hauling.  We used to be able to print of billions of credits for almost no effort hauling carbon to the inner systems.  Several people invested their colonies entirely into carbon, and because of the nerf to prices they rage quit, caused a lot of drama and put out some negative reviews.\n\nThey aren't wrong on all of their points, but they're coming from a perspective of upset and revenge.  It's an early access game soon to come to fruition, and worth every penny.\n\nStill one of the best communities out of any online game.  Entire community spirit of the game is based on cooperation, so if that's what you're looking for, this is where it is.\n\n===================================================================\n--Original Review--\n===================================================================\nThis game is a lot of fun.\n\nThe game is still in Alpha stage at the moment, and while there are a lot of needed QoL updates, the basic, and even a lot of the more advanced gameplay features are functioning as they should.\n\nThis game is very different than most other MMOs.   The pace isn't fast, you don't rush for anything, you can try, but it's still going to take time to learn the game, to progress through research, and to learn more as you go.   A little bit complicated to figure out at first, but once you do figure it out it's easy to learn more.\n\nThe community in this game is extremely helpful, and mature.  The developer is Dedicated, and has a good idea where he's going with the game.    after 500 hours in I'm still enjoying nearly everything to the game.\n\nIf you would like a headstart I highly recommend watching some of the tutorials made by Waervyn.  They are highly understandable and explain things in much greater detail.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLa53kfJdPTHCnVW7jAsLARIF1mVWwWxsx\n\nMining is a lot of fun, there's no AFKing to it, and there's no scooping stupid rocks each time.\n\nTrading is very profitable and fun once you've got the cargo space to make it worth your time.\n\nCombat is not quite done as of yet, but is the next priority on the developer's plan.  He has huge visions for where he wants to take this game, and it's going to be awesome to see what he does with combat.\n\nExploration is incredibly fun.  From Extrememly rare Neutron stars to Blackholes to regular K type stars you can find it all.  Earth Like planets are rumored to exist but are insanely rare, the nebulae in systems are quite beautiful, and the planet procedural generation is really something to look at.\n\nColony management has received updates now that make it so much easier to start building your colonies YAY :).\n\nThe Dev is currently seeking a UI Programmer for , but the mechanics are very functional.\n\nVery interesting game system different from pretty much any other game I can think of.  Sort of a Mix of Eve Online's Planetary Interaction, and X series Station building is the best way I can describe it.\n\nAll in All worth every Penny.","April 25, 2015","true","299.4"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","1"

The UI is poor, some of the text boxes have a black background so you can read them, and the rest have transparent backgrounds making them almost impossible to read at some of the space stations - especially if another ship happens to be docked in that view area.\n\nYou can get as many contracts as you want, but some mysteriously disappear in transit. I have been using a spreadsheet that has the various resources and specials listed in the rows and the stations listed for the columns. Each can show 9 contracts, who supplies what, and shows passengers and packages. At every station that I dock at, I go through the scrolling window and verify which contracts were fullfilled or just disappeared so I know exactly how much I need to get and deliver. For instance I know Elysium is the supplier of Titanium, and on my spreadsheet I see that I have a contract to deliver 56 units to Orion, three contracts with Mica (52, 44, and 34 units) and 34 units to Solaris. I have color coded the space stations so I know which warplines they are on. So I know I have to jump to Mica first, in order to continue down that warpline to Solaris.\n\nI have been able to upgrade ships quickly, so I am in a class 5 now and almost ready to buy a class 6. Unfortunately, I am not able to hire a pilot to run the old ships even though in the manage ship section there are text buttons for pilot and crew. You can sell your old ships on the galactic market, but you can not get back to your listed ship to change price or take it off the market. I have never received a notification of a listed ship being sold so there could be my class 1, 2, 3, and 4 ships still up for sale.\n\nA recent update gave us the option of turning off the white screen that shows during a warp. Unfortunately, we do not have any control over the rest of the psychedelic warp screens which show for way too long. There are no controls to set up a transit route or a trade route. If I had 58 iron, 42 grain, and 60 fruit in the hold and I am going from Andromeda to Plato to deliver the iron contract, then to Archon for the grain delivery, and finally to Solaris to deliver the fruit I have to manually select each warp gate and each station. So it would 12 warp segments to accomplish those deliveries. Each individual segment has to be done separately after sitting through another long viewing of the same psychedelic warp scene. Even cheap GPS units today allow you to do a trip plan with intermediate stops. Surely a civilization that has the technology to build warp gates and space stations could concieve of a better trip planner.\n\nAt some warp gates a fuzzy red blob will come flying at you then execute a 90 degree turn and fly off into the heavens. Since the ship or shields have never been damaged, I have to assume that it is not someone attacking me.\n\nI have bought blueprints for each of the bays in the private space station and for a farm on the surface of Ceres. Building will not commence though until you deliver all of the raw materials needed for each section. I have tried to deliver the farm robots and some material to the surface, but could not offload anything. I ended up stuffing everything in the hanger with the hope that it will become clearer with more gameplay on how to actually initiate building and delivering of goods.\n\nIt is in early release and the developers are steadily working on the bugs and player feedback so I am hopeful that the UI, trip planning, building, and overall look and feel will steadily improve. Right now it is just rote grinding, upgrading ships, and slowly assembling the parts to have a private space station and surface farm.","July 5, 2015","false","41.5"," 19 of 27 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","19","27","0","3"

And the clock says I've got 48 hrs in.  That's with logging in to play, exiting when I am not playing.  Needless to say, this game has grabbed my interest in a way that other games haven't.  The last game I got this interested in was WoW back in 2005.\n\nThis game is a space exploration, mining, building, crafting, MMORPG.  There is a Galactic Market (auction) that you can put your crafted or used items on.  There are contracts from NPCs you can run to get credits.  There is limited PVE but no PVP (yet).\n\nIt has a rapidly expanding community, as it was *just* released on Steam EA a few days ago.  There are a few die hard Kickstarter supporters that are firmly entrenched and know everything, a few middle of the roaders, and a bunch of noobs fast gaining experience.  The community is typically friendly and helpful.  They never seem to tire of answering the same questions over and over from the newest noobies.  They are charitable with advice, and occasionally ship upgrades.  The game developer actually logs in and chats with players fairly often, answering questions and generally being friendly.\n\nOne concern I always have coming into a game where some have been playing it for a while is that they tend to stake out their claims to the best of whatever resources you can find.  They have the best gear, and I hate playing catch up ball.  However, this game has 270 billion (with a b) explorable star systems.  Everyone can name a system after themselves, and colonize a planet.  And everyone else can come visit.  And as to gearing up, it happens quickly.  You progress from a tiny ship to a humongous ship in your first few days.  There are more things to aspire to (ie bigger ships yet, starbases, colonies, star systems named after you), so there is always room to grow.\n\nThe pros of this game are it is fun, has a great community, a lot to do, and loads of potential.  The cons are a somewhat clunky interface (sorry Jam!), and that it is still a work in progress.  But it is a fun, playable, very social work in progress.\n\nThis game is well worth getting.  If you have read this far, you are wasting time; go get it and get exploring!\n\nI would gladly recommend this game.","March 6, 2015","true","195.4"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","14","18","0","0"

If you were born in the 80's or 90's, they you should probably like it due to the nostalgia level graphics of a AAA game made in that time period. Also, for fans of outer space, space ships, mining ,farming, ect, then this game is going to be a great idea to buy during a sale.\n\nYou can: farm, sell items, buy items, mine, get destoryed by Enemies, get more ships, upgrade your ship/s in many ways, destroy enemies, explore 270,000,000,000 (270 billion) star systems worth of:  exploration, colonization, starbase construction, research and technology, mining and farming, trading and combat.  Also, outside the first sector, everything in game is made by real players. There's some spects of 'City simulation' involved, but I didn't discover completely yet. The game is so much cheaper than EVE or Elite: Dangerous, while it also having some fast developement speed, awesome and trutworthy community plus many of hundreds of hours making the game play for you, make it what you want! If you want a City simulator, then so be it. Like mining? Do that then.\n\nGameplay\n\nOh boy, where to start. The tutorial is a bit floaty and hard, especially the part  where you need to fight a weak drone. You spend ages just aiming at it since the ship is so light and moves so fast while also sliding too far. Then, once it is in sight, you can spend ages shooting at it, after quite literally 30-90 minutes, you have finished the drone part, which is where I quit the tutorial and went onto the game itself. After the tutorial is done, spend a lot of time finding the icon for the Autopliot (which is transparent until you hover above it), and then spending around 10 minsutes doing the firs fex missions. Then the real fun part is trying to find out what to do on your own. Farming? No, can't conolize a planet yet. Destroy ships? Nah, can't find any. Destroy Asteroid and meteorites? Yes, then sell it all for cash. After the first 60 mins of gaming, you should have around 10K cash, which you can do quite a lot with.\n\nGraphics\n\nThe graphics might not look like much, but they are still quite pretty, also, it keeps the loading times less than 5 seconds! So that right there is a giant point to the finalized score. Anyway, moving on. The graphics are what you would expect from an Early Access game midway-nearly finished developement. Anyway, these are still some pretty graphics and are satisfactory for my needs and, hopefully, the majourity of the audience can agree with me on this topic.\n\nCurrent Content\n\nThis is where beauty truly met the eye. As I already said in the overview and gameplay topics, this game has some of the .ost in-depth systems ever to be in a video game. So think of EVE + Elite Dangerous, a game based around space and becoming a high rank withing the community by upgrading ships, colonizing your soon-to-be empire and so, so much more to come. The developers are awesome, they listen to feedback, do Kickstarters to help out with lots of different subjects (one of the most recent one was for the games graphic improvements), but, in my opinion, the HuD is very ugly. the Chat has its own HuD, most things do, but it's a try-hard at doing a futuristic orange 6th grade art project\n\nPros and Cons\n\nPros:\nGraphics are quite pretty\nSo much actions waiting to be completed\nQuests that aren't all terrible\nYou need to put loads of work into getting enough money to buy something, which then is so rewarding\nVery cheap for it's content count\nTrustworthy community\nMining\nFarming\nCity simulation properties\nResearch\nMore things like the ones above\n270Billion + star systems\nSome very far exploration\nTons of shipos, upgrades ect (lots of customization)\nTutorial that is informative and has a funny teacher (Dave the computer)\nDialouge\nYou don't need Premium for most things, if not, all\nAn extremely promising Early Access game\n\nCons:\nThe combat objective in the Tutorial is quite hard\n\nFinal scores\nGameplay - 8.5/10\nGraphics - 6.5/10\nContent - 8/10\nFinal score (Metascore, if you will) 77/100\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group\nCheck out the Original Network Groups.

(This isn't listed on the steam page, I previously stated $8, however the store page is unclear in game)\n\nYou can warp/fly through planets and stars, ships and asteroids, if they're in your way.\n\nBugs galore. You may constantly need to restart the game while docked for it to see what items you have in your hull, or to fulfill a quest.\n\nNo jettising of un-needed items. See below, dev response. No idea how to do it.\n\nYou must dock some where and drop off or sell everything you pick up. With this mechanic, everything left at a star port or base or whatever its called, you have to go back there to pick it up. There is no global inventory system. (This is good because each ship has a limited hull, just creates a headache.)\n\nControls are a disaster.\n\nGraphics are horrible.\n\nPretty much every quest is a "fetch" quest. While you may not have to do these to gain money, it would be nice to have something a little more... in depth.\n\nThis started off as a web browser game.... While not directly a flaw, it's still relevant. (Rust was originally a web based game too)\n\nThis is the poor man's care bear version of Elite Dangerous, or Star Citizen.\n\nThe combat system is interesting, but boring. Most times your just holding mouse 1 and aiming at the AI bad guys. There's little you can do to evade or out smart the AI. Their hits are pretty much direct, and its a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ contest of who has a bigger ship.\n\nThe only "complex" part of this game is working around the bugs and controls. Depth.. I guess that's subjective. Rich get richer seems pretty much how this game will end with hardly any room for new people if this game expands any further.\n\n\nPros\nYou can warp everywhere pretty much. Not too much manual boring flying.\n\nEverything is easy to earn given some time.\n\nMe and the first few main characters I came in contact with share the same last name.

Finding a planet to colonize involves sampling its land and atmosphere and deciding wether its worthy or not of human colonization in relation to the future aim of this colony.\n- Smuggling non legal goods into colonies of players that decided that their citizens shouldnt consume drugs, smokes, alcohol etc.\n- Taking part in politics in order to build a "better universe" ordering warp gates to more remote star systems.\n- Ships can be built, bought and equiped with modules that also can be built or bought relevant to what you like to do (cargo hauling, gas skimming, mining, fighting etc.)\n- Eventually the aim of Ascent is to spread cooporativly the human race by the colonization and the building of a logistical and an economical working system in space. With the mutual effort of many players together warping gates can be built in between selected star systems to allow easier movement from place to place.\n\n\n***The Bad***\n- Some graphical glitches occur but nothing that makes the game unplayble, other than that the graphics are actually pretty enough considering one doesnt need a strong system to run the game.\n- The learning curve requires you to do some reading in the in-game help articles.\n\n***To summerize:***\n\nIn case you are looking for a relaxed online space game that is dealing not with warefare but with the cooporative colonization of space you should definetly give this game a try because\nAscent is a PVE space MMO that is dealing not with destruction but construction.","May 5","true","72.2"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","14","19","2","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/doubledeuce/recommended/345010/","doubledeuce","Double Deuce","http://steamcommunity.com/id/doubledeuce/","153 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nDo I like this game, yes. Why? Read all the positive reviews, the points are thorough.  Ones I didn't see listed are it's procedurally generated. Complex trading system but not overly complicated.  I like to play the market, so with hyperdrives (being able to jump to systems as long as you have hydrogen, which is fuel for hyperdrive) and you can find lucrative trade routes.\n\nDo I recommend this game, yes.\nWhy? The community is full of helpful people.  This is probably the most helpful and friendly community that I've seen in a very long time.  With so many toxic communities / forums out there, this one is a breathe of fresh air.  People actually work together.\n\nWould I buy it again, yes.\nWhy?  While I want to get the name out there and support the dev (Jam) for such a great vision in what I'm looking for, some people are on a budget and I do believe the web client you can get completely free and play in a browser.  You can use up to class 5 ship modules on a free account (non-premium, which is the cheapest I've seen in any game, it's like 3 bucks a month or something) and you can only build in the inner planets which number to about 8 I think ( the warp gate linked planets, outer systems is a reference to everything outside the inner systems)\n\nMajor things to point out that sold me on this game not listed above:\n-The dev Jam interacts with the community on a daily basis, he listens, looks at the bug reports, hotfixes these bugs he's made aware of on a daily basis as he can get to them, and he keeps the community updated.  This guy is very transparent about what he's doing / trying to do.\n\n-Sinstrite made a youtube series on this game which also helped sell me.  His youtube channel is here: https://www.youtube.com/user/Sinstrite and I recommend starting with episode one.  I personally watched and enjoyed them all before buying.  If you're  only going to watch one vid, I recommend the develepor (dev) interview.\n\n-When you buy this game off Steam (currently 17ish bucks) and first load into the game, you will show up as newuser#.  You will need to register to setup your in-game handle.  You can find this at the top in game, under options > register.  Now if you buy through Steam, you have 3 months premium when you want to use it.  I recommend learning the game / get as far as you feel is right for you before activating premium as this extends your time in a way and is simply not needed.  Now if you get to the bigger ships and want to get into mining mainly then I recommend the best mining laser you can get as the class modules are basically multipliers.  Just ask questions / watch vids / use the wiki (in-game help " H " links to the wiki) the wiki is located here: http://wiki.thespacegame.com/mediawiki/index.php/Main_Page\n\n-The game forums are here: http://forum.thespacegame.com/\n\n-Once you decide to claim your Steam 3 months premium I recommend, setting your Steam account to public (just change it back after registering), Having the Steam overlay on (It's on by default unless you tell it to be off by default).\n\n-I go by the $1 per hour price when gauging if a game is worth it or not, entertainment wise.  I payed 17 bucks since it's on  sale on Steam, and I have 40 hours at the time of this writing.  So according to my gorilla math, it's well worth it.\n\n-I highly recommend using the wiki and asking questions in game.  The community is fantastic and helpful, this alone makes the game worth it imo.\n\n-There's many other things not listed such as programmable command in the ship computer that let you do many, many things, the most common is ejecting unwanted cargo.  You can bind all these commands using alias.  Think Valve games where you can bind keys using alias's.  It's very helpful and complex, again all this stuff is on the wiki.  There's way too many to list.\n\n-This is obvious but needs to be said.  This game is Early Access.  There will be bugs.  This is run by a one man dev team and he busts his backside trying to further this game.  There's new stuff added / fixed daily and the beauty of it the server usualy isn't taken down to do these, it's just there, you download  the updates.  You should know it's  EA by the huge blue text and Early Access sub game list it's under and that means it's not release, so before you go buying into what the four negative reviews compared to the 40ish+ positive ones, look at what they are saying and think about what EA is before taken them to heart.\n\n-The mining system is the most fun in any space game I've played.  You have to interact / pay attention while mining, It's skill based meaning you have to get between a certain temperature range which determines how much ore you get, and it you do too little or too much temperature then you get nothing (too little and you just have to do it again, too much heat and the asteroid is vaporized).  Asteroids can grow in size / yield the longer they aren't mined.  This system encourages exploration in finding lucrative asteroid fields once you get a hyperdrive.  It's a very unique and welcomed way to mine.\n\nAll in all this game is fun so far and I'm enjoying the ride / community.  As always I recommend watching youtube /  twitch vids before  making a decision, and hopefully you'll come to the same conclusion I did and pick up the game.  See you in game!","March 4, 2015","true","47.4"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

I've deliberately not attached these labels to these highlights so -you- can decide for yourself what they are.\n\nThe galaxy is huge!  It is repeatedly asserted that it would take years to explore the entire galaxy.\n\nIf you discover one of the billions of star systems out there, it gets named after you. Note that anyone can do this in a matter of days; I saw a fairly new player discover a star system just yesterday.\n\nDeep space exploration requires a hyperdrive matched to your ship and fuel; you can skim gas giants to get this fuel.\n\nThe colonization mechanics look extremely interesting. You really do have to take scientific measurments on a planet and determine if it's worth colonizing. Once you colonize, you actually have to do some engineering (making breathable atmosphere, dealing with gravity and air pressure, etc).\n\nBefore colonization happens, you almost certainly will build settlments (planetary mining and food production) and a starbase (research, certain factories, ship construction, ship modules). These can be done much faster and from day one. They still require resources to build, just not as much.\n\nIt's somewhat repetitive (grindy) to make money. Once you "tier up" and build some settlements, it does get faster. Planetary colonization should be considered a top tier financial effort.\n\nBlueprint research is "gated" and takes quite a long time, forcing purchases from older players to get started (unless you want to wait over two months).\n\nFor those that like community, you can decide to build a jump gate in your sector. Building jump gates requires a massive resource effort from multiple players to complete.\n\nThis game is developed by -one- guy. While this is impressive, it does mean updates may not be as fast as most gamers demand them.\nOverall I recommend this game because I like it.\n\nHowever, this game may not be for everyone, and I encourage you to read on past the TL;DR point to understand my perspective better.\n\nTL:DR point\nI've been playing a short time (46 hours over two weeks) and wanted to start a review before the repetitive nature of what I'm doing casts the game in a more negative light than I'd like.  So this is more of a stream of consciousness description for those that want more information or to see where I'm coming from. Note well that I'm not a veteran player, and that my perspective will more closely match a new player's perspective...I feel this kind of perspective is more valuable because a veteran has usually overlooked things that are annoyances and/or game-breakers to most people. These issues obviously don't game break for the vets since....they are still playing\n\nMy draw to this game is this: I've learned there is a set of what look like awesome colonization mechanics that appear to make it worth grinding to get to. In studying these mechanics, it seems there's a lot of interesting engineering to be done just to find a spot to colonizxe, let alone manage and maintain your colonies. It seems you have to build and manage environmental domes (unless the atmosphere is perfect) and supply them with the atmospheric gases you need to maintain a habitable environment for your colonists. You have to do this before you can get to any of the good stuff (e.g. growing food, mining resources) that a colony will help you with.\n\nThe caveat here is that I can't do any of this neat gameplay yet. I need to make at least a billion or two before I can afford it, plus I need to research a few key factory blueprints and get more settlements up producing goods.\n\nThis brings me to my pet peeve of this game...Research.\n\nResearching anything: 24 hours. Increasing the level of something: level * 24 hours. ("Class" is a synonym for "level" in this game). Class 12 gear is what you'll need for the top tier ship that you can get. It will take you over two months (78 days) just to research ONE key ship module to that level. Examples of key modules: weapons, hyperdrives, mining beams, and ram scoops. This means I'm mostly forced to buy these modules from players if I want to make faster progress. (You can argue that I could spend the better part of the year just logging in long enough to cycle my research to the next class. That's ludicrious to me, but technically true.)\n\nThis is not game breaking for me, but see above...I have a draw that I want to explore. There have been a couple of discussions in chat about this issue where frustration was expressed and I'm sure new players will find this frustrating. Be ye warned if you want to play. I still think it's worth it, but that's me.\n\nIf you are going to research, you'll want to build your starbase quickly. This is going to require cash for blueprints (available via the contracts board) and resources (available from space stations and players). If you want a steady stream of resources (income), you can start building settlements. Settlements, set up correctly, allow one a certain amount of resource income per day. Both settlements and starbases take a bit of work to setup; it's going to take many trips for you if your ship's cargo hold is small. I waited until I had a big enough ship.\n\nYes, there's repetitive content.\n\nMaking money for me was initially about buying low to fill my cargo holds and selling high between space stations, easily reached by the autopilot menu.  Once I had enough money, I could buy the next tier of ship which holds more cargo. This allowed me to make money even faster. If you are new, please discover the "stock market search" in the map screen; this will allow you to find places to buy trade goods even cheaper. At some point, for me this was when I was flying a class 6 ship, trading becomes less lucrative than mining asteroids. I was able to get a relatively inexpensive class 5 mining beam and suddenly I was swimming in lucrative resources. I was able to use contracts (available at space stations) and the previously mentioned stock market search to turn the resources into credits.\n\nSo...at the moment, when I want more cash, I go farm asteroids. Repeatedly. I do vary where I do this, and because my cargo hold isn't uber huge (I'm in a hammer atm) I do have to break and go drop off/sell my cargo. It's not bad at all for me, and I -am- what people call "ADD" so I do need lots of stimulus to not be bored.  But this is me.\n\nSo, if you like space games, resource factories, economics, and science...this game is definately for you.\n\nI may revisit this review after I've been playing a lot longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","March 14, 2015","true","215.4"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","1"

Of course it is still growing as it is in early access but I only see things going more positive as development progresses.  It's not the prettiest game out there (looking at you ED) but it does have a ♥♥♥♥ ton of things to do (looking at you again ED).  EVE isn't my thing for most of the various reasons you hear other people saying EVE isn't their thing so I don't see a need to write out why it isn't for me.  I love trading and building and having a sense of progression with my ship/company/player or whatever instead of just trying to get more credits (ED).  I find myself invested and interested in my space station and my land farms/mines.  Ascent is a game you can pick up and play without learning a ♥♥♥♥ ton of stuff (besides the computer console, which I believe after some usage it isn't that hard).  If you like space games and are willing to accept the fact this is early access and major things are still getting fleshed out (even though it is 100% playable for me right now without even noticing it is early access) then I would say check this game out.","March 6, 2015","true","83.3"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

That time has come and I'm not disappointed.  This is a community-focused game with a real economy the size of which far exceeds ANYTHING in a non-subscription based MMO.  The scale of this game is phenomenal while the controls are wonderfully simple.  The game seems more economy based than combat based but there are combat vessels and weapons and all that.  Two things I wish were in the game but aren't are PvP and ship design, but who gives a ♥♥♥♥?  We have newtonian physics and 270 BILLION STAR SYSTEMS!  There are a few core systems which you start off in, and these are connected by jump gates.  All the other systems require a jump drive to get to.  What is so very cool is that groups of incredibly industrious players have started building new gates to connect the first few colonised systems to the core systems.

Monthly subscription system is a major turnoff, too. Comes with a few months by default, which is nice, but there's a huge wall of grinding between you and getting to a lot of the features the game is advertised for. I have over a dozen hours and I'm still literally just grinding cash, trying to get a spaceship capable of going exploring out into the systems outside of the base 9. Most of this grinding is done by clicking autopilot buttons. Settlement and star base construction system has absurdly dumb crafting times (time per module is measured in a number of real time hours, often numbering above twenty - freaking - hours!). Number of colonies and star bases you can have is based on how much real money you spend per month - you can go and buy bigger subscriptions to get more planets. Your control over the planets you colonized is based on how many people have built colonies there and how willing you are to involve yourself in the politics process. As in, in-game elections and such. Which is an interesting concept, but I hesitate to see it in practice as it strikes me as a potentially nasty means of griefing. Combat is *extremely* clunky and awkward, and the radar system is in desperate need of a revamp. Indicators are small and difficult to make out unless you expand the radar, which makes it difficult to aim your frontal guns, which are fixed with your movement. There are broadside and 90 degree cone turrets, but those are totally automated and have no player input beyond placing them on your ship. As far as I can tell, there are no variety in weapons, and combat is restricted to one zone.\n\nAll in all, this game strikes me as something I would expect to see out of an alpha. The graphics are rather weak compared to performance (I have a Radeon r9 380, 8 core AMD processor, and 16 gb ram, and my FPS on the second worst setting ranges between 60 to 30 in normal play, but the game's actual material in peak settings is on par with something that's like, ten years old?), it crashes pretty much once per hour. Sometimes those crashes are severe enough to require a hard restart of my PC -- I checked on the forums and this isn't an isolated incident, either, and has happened to people on a wide range of systems - on high end to low end computers. Combined with the massive grind wall to get access to the content with even a shred of depth, and this game was a huge let down for me. I *really* wanted to like this game, but *DO NOT* let the trailer fool you.

I enjoy building slowly to develop self-sufficiency, but, in the four months I’ve played, I have been the recipient of much kind advice and an occasional helping hand. I have to echo what so many others have said, this game has a great, caring community.\n\nJam is an incredibly talented developer. I am grateful that he has kept true to his own vision which, I think, has produced the coherence and scale we see already in this relatively early stage of the game. Yet he is very responsive to player experience and ideas. That makes it much easier to be patient when glitches arise, as they must, during the development process. We know Jam will address them.\n\nAs to gameplay, I am able to immerse myself in the game’s premise, that we are struggling to recover and rebuild the high civilization we’ve lost. As a number of other players have done, I have developed my own tools, primarily spreadsheets, catalogs and calculators, to record my own exploration and production data. What has been for some an inconvenience has been for others an element of realism.\n\nAt the same time, I am able to engage the community’s meta-game, expressed on the forum and wiki, in the lively chat flow, and now, perhaps, here in the Steam forum.\n\nFinally, Ascent is the kind of game that allows me to step back when RL demands.

After getting the hang of the controls, i can say this is definitely a call back to the golden age of space sims. Enjoying every minute of it, with the overcomplication of controls in most other space sims nowadays (some of which you need a user manual sitting by your side constantly) the controls feel smooth and natural, if i had any criticism at all it would only be that i haven't yet found a way to lock the third person camera to the rear of the ship. Early days for this game, but it shows a huge amount of potential, and the gameplay is already much more polished than many games which are at full-release point on steam.","April 5, 2015","true","32.7"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

This game still is not worth buying just for thier lack of transparency alone.\n\n\n\nStrike one: I buy the game and then find out there is a premium service for a monthly service charge. The store page is incredibly misleading. The subscription (which is mandatory btw if you REALLY want to play the game) is not mentioned on the store page in the same way and same place as other games with subscriptions. The subscription is very cheap, about 2 cups of coffee a month, but the sneakiness just gives you a bad taste.\n\nStrike two: I play the game and am confronted with not just horrible graphics but horrible UI. Ok I understand this is early access but the game is soo ugly it really kind of hurts to look at it. We are talking year 2000 graphics here. But hats not all, the ships are copies from other games, least they sure look like clones. The space stations are an eyesore, not the graphics but the design. The area where you dock small ships pretty much looks like it was a complete after thought. It sticks out of the stations like  an oversized mole on a midgets face, not just no orginality, but zero and i mean zero aesthetics.\n\nStrike three: Ok forget the graphics, the UI, the sneaky little subscription charge (which is cheap) they had to get something right, right?  For me im thinking/hoping that at least the ships fly right. NOPE!  They fly like a turd. Absolutely zero feeling of flight, just feels like crap is moving on your screen. The flight controls are horrendous and not just talking about the default assignments which you can change well some of the controls you can change(sadly not the ones you want). Couldn't even remap the controls for left and right wing dip (they call it spin +/-) to my saitek x52 joystick rotation because they apparently didnt think you would want to use your joystick for something like that. Over all you end up not wanting to fly and this is a space game! Thats like microsofts flight simulator being so horrible you dont want to fly I mean come on! So I ended up just doing the tutorial and clicking autopilot everywhere because it was painful, literally painful to fly (had to try and use joystick and mouse and keynoard all at once cause one a few controls can be mapped ect)  .............IF YOU LIKE SPACE GAMES TO GIVE YOU THE FEELING OF FLYING AROUND SPACE DO NOT GET THIS GAME!\n\nMaybe in the future it can be fixed, but right now this plays out as more of an economic simulator (buy/sell grind with owning farms/mines ect and adding your home made stuff to your buying and selling grind. The originality in alot of areas is actually pretty good but it fails in the most very basic most important area.... it does not feel like a space game.","April 11, 2015","false","1.2"," 18 of 29 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","18","29","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zanriel/recommended/345010/","zanriel","Zanriel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zanriel/","874 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nHere's a little video introduction I made, showing what the gameplay is like:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__4JuOciKTA\n\nI'm really digging it so far. The tutorial is easy to follow, the controls are smooth, and navigating around is pain free. You can either free fly or click on destinations to autopilot, and when you do that it's FAST. I mean, you're at your destination almost instantly. I've never played a space game before where getting around was so quick and painless.\n\nAs you move from station to station you can accept contracts, which change at random intervals. There's also a story mission that starts during the tutorial and continues, leading you "breadcrumb" style through the different aspects of the game... trading, navigating, accepting contracts, and so on, until eventually you're led to start exploring.\n\nThe main draw, for me at least, is the PVE focus. PVP sandbox space games are a dime a dozen, but the developers of Ascent - The Space Game have decided to do something different to really stand out from the crowd, and I couldn't be happier.\n\nLand you can develop SimCity style, placing buildings and such? It's in there, yep. Way cool. This game reminds me of Yankee Trader / Trade Wars in that way, how you can own and manage property. Blueprints for different buildings and technologies are expensive at first, but Rome wasn't built in a day was it?\n\n[Update 3/1/2015]\nI've put some more time into it and I've noticed a few areas that could use some improvement. First off, sometimes it's not real obvious what to do, or how to do what you want to do. For example, I was looking at the shipyard and found an ultra light fighter and it was cheap, so I bought it. I flew around but I couldn't shoot anything. I thought maybe it didn't come with guns, but I couldn't figure out how to look. I ran through the tutorial again just to make sure, and when the drone came out I was able to shoot it (took FOREVER) but before and after that my guns didn't do anything. I had to ask in chat what was up and people said they only work if you're aiming at an enemy NPC or an asteroid. Oh, that would have been nice to know, the UI should tell you why things aren't working.\n\nI got a quest to deliver 10 miner robots to 3 different places, but I couldn't figure out where to get them. I had to ask around and someone said "contract board". Oh, so you have to get these from the contract board, but it's random whether you'll find them available there. Nothing in the contract description says this, and if the NPC who gave me the contract to deliver these robots told me, I'd forgotten.\n\nI sold my starter ship because I didn't think I'd need it anymore. I put it up on the global market, and then it was gone. I changed my mind and wanted to cancel the sale but nothing I could find in the UI or any of the menus showed how to do that. I googled it and searched the forums but no answer. Again I had to ask in chat, and they said "Just buy it back from the GM." I found another starter ship just like the one I'd just sold for even less and bought it, but huh, that was awkward.\n\nWhat I'm saying is, the UI could use some improvement. More information. Maybe the tutorial could also explain things a bit better.\n\nAlso, I asked and was told that there's not really much in the way of co-op in the game. There aren't incentives for co-op or any way to form wings or squadrons. There are a few shared community projects like gates and such, but in terms of forming a group to go raid a base or provide escort, that's not really a thing. More social / co-op features would be good. Maybe random events or group missions? Or pirates building bases or sending out invasion fleets, making people have to band together to drive them back? I don't know, I think things like that are probably being planned.\n\nBeing a sandbox game it's easy to get lost or reach a point where you're not sure what to do next. That's my problem with most sandbox games and this one is no exception. I'd like to be a combat pilot and take contracts for bounty missions but it looks like you pretty much have to do mining and trading before you can get a ship good enough for combat. So yes, technically you're free to do whatever you want, but you still have to jump through certain hoops to get there. Still though, the game is way more accessible than the X series or Evochron Mercenary.","February 27, 2015","true","4.4"," 21 of 35 people (60%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","60","21","35","5","2"

It also has some cool rare asteroids that feel rewarding when you find them\n\n- Cons\n\n- Confusing monthly fee that is based on tiers and is kind of hidden from you until after you buy what appears to be an online-only client - game is free to play after you buy the client but at a steep cost in the form of restricted features\n- Fifteen bucks for no singleplayer\n- Doesn't work on Linux even despite being developed in unity\n- Ran like garbage on my Macbook even despite being developed in unity\n- Playerbase is only 30 to 40 players in the absolute best case scenario, community could die at any moment\n- Like most sandbox games, this is only for players who can entertain themselves in a sandbox\n- Repetitive trading expected with most space games, but this game is worse because some galaxies have dozens of player colonies so jumping into said system causes extreme lag\n- Making colonies and planting domes sounds good and all, but there's alot of research required to get into this game and you need to know that setting up your colonies requires actual console commands and some math skills\n- Game rewards players who are the most intelligent and spend the most time, this is a good or a bad thing depending on your perspective\n- Combat sucks in this game so bad but it is early access. nobody does combat in this game right now because it is a painfully frustrating experience\n- Game is basically a singleplayer experience with an MMO gimmick. There's no function that allows you to team up with other players, and interaction with other players is limited to financial transactions\n- Can explore unknown star systems, but all are empty and generic. some planets have no textures whatsoever and look lame. stars only come in three types. some systems might have an asteroid belt with rare spawns but that's about it. you wouldn't want to colonize these unknown stars systems as they are so far away so exploring them is mostly pointless\n- No npc missions aside from courier runs (trading) and most aren't worth doing. not much to do in this game if you're not building a colony or a starbase\n\nShould note that the game does have a premium option, you get three months with the purchase and after that it's 1.00 per month per tier to a maximum of 3.00 per month. Premium features include being able to fly class 13+ ships, mount class 13+ weapons, and to have 8 free newbie colonies in the NPC populated core systems.\n\nIMO, having the starting newbie systems for a dollar a month isn't really worth it, except for the fact that without it you can't build more than six rings on your newbie starbase (you get the first starbase free). It's a significant disadvantage as starbases cap out at 100 rings. The newbie colonies are not as robust as the outer colony system and are extremely limited - one can only expect yields of 10,000 resources per colony per half day or day depending on colony efficiency whereas the outer colony systems can yield MILLIONS or even BILLIONS per day as they are huge, and furthermore can yield more than one resource. They can also act as player controlled trade hubs.","September 19, 2015","true","125.1"," 14 of 22 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","14","22","0","1"

I finally picked it up again about a week ago and I completely regret having left. Most of the bugs and promised features from when I left have been implemented and the game has progressed extremely far and I'm very excited to see where it's going to go and to be a part of that.\n\nAs to what I specifically like about the game. The best thing by far is the community. I have never encountered a community so helpful and encouraging before. The more experienced players are willing to go way out of their way to help others. It's honestly amazing and I hope it stays that way. I also like the focus on PvE (if you want PvP or combat in general it hasn't really been worked on yet so you might want to wait) The game really allows you to create your own interplanetary empire and expand it to your hearts content, but within that you can focus on so many different things like mining, trading, production, exploring, or dabble in them all. It reall has so many amazingly detailed features considered how early it is in development and while it certainly has a learning curve, it's extremely easy to learn quickly if you ask for help from the community.\n\nOverall I think it's a great game and is worth the try. Plus if you want to try it out before buying it on steam you can do so for free at http://www.thespacegame.com/play.html. So I ecourage you to give it a try and see how you like it.","March 14, 2015","true","632.2"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

I have a few hours invested in it and am very impressed with the updates since last April.  The quality has improved greatly and the gameplay is also impoving.  With one Developer, an Artist, and now a UI Programmer  it is amazing what has been done thus far.  The Community is great and much like a family, even down to the sibling rivalry between some, but somehow they all come together and help out newcomers as much as they can.  If you can't get an answer in-game there is a wiki that has a tutorial walkthrough that is very helpful for rookies.  The in-game help file references it.  With the up-coming full release we are promised a pvp as well as the pve game.  Yes the game has some rough edges, yes there is a subscription model, 1 dollar up to 3 dollars a month, (servers have to be kept running), and yes it is 20 dollars, but the developer and his team have a passion for the game I haven't seen for a long while.

Unfortunatly the game sucks, dot because its a bad game concept. There are some critical bugs that the dev is ignoring. In fact hes ignoring everything, ever his loyal subscribers, which is another issue. I 1st thought this game was brilliant, untill i got to the poosition of having a big enough ship and credits behing me to go exploring and setting up new bases. 1st issue is the time investment needed to set up a base. You have to wait 50 hours for the dome to build, and hope it do not float, or sink after you have built it, making it useless. Then You must wait 24 hours to purify gasses, and then 22 hours for anything else to build. That is not the real issue except for the floating,sinking bases. You are charged stella credits for each base you have, no problem, the problem is the feature to "abandon base" was ommited recently, so You will be charged real world money for every base you can not abandon.\nMy count is at 8 that im being charged 80 Stella Credits per month for, that are totally useless to me and can no longer abandon. So i write bug report, what reply do i get....nada,zilch, nothing, zero... except from as i said "best thing about this game is the dedicated players" especially a character called "ram" who is so dedicated to this game, the dev should make a deal with him to manage its development, and the dev should get back to doing what he is able to do, and thats code.\n\nThere is no option to cancll your subscription, so only way is to make a new real world bank account.\n\nDev really needs to get his act together and prioritise critical issues, especially 1 that involves taking money from peoples bank accounts, and not run around trying to raise money, something that should have been done prior to release, or employ/make deal with someone who is experienced in doing so. People would make deals with the dev, but it appears the dev wants to do everything, and be in total controll, without anyone else advising him how to do it, and delegate responsibilitys to them.","May 17","false","522.0"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","8"

For instance, even though it is easy to implement in Unity, there isn't a mouse look mode option. Instead one has to hold the right mouse button (only in FPS view) to use the mouse look, which has a massive dead zone that can't be changed and causes UI elements to be activated  and control to be lost when the mouse moves over them. Inexcusable, even for an "indie game" - I didn't have any problem following the mouse look tutorials when I was working with Unity.\n\n- The land based graphics are straight out of 1991, but it looks nice in space.\n\n- The human characters are honestly laughable.  They would be fine for an open source hobby game, but not in a game people are expected to pay for.\n\n- Streaming assets rather than simply allowing all the assets to be downloaded ahead of time. I don't care that Guild Wars 2 takes 30GB of my hard drive space - at least it doesn't completely freeze because it has to download new assets when I turn the camera.\n\n- Memory leaks that cause my computer to lock up, while the game thrashes the living daylights out my drives. Only way to stop it is to turn off the PC.\n\n- The quest system is incomplete and does not have proper tracking or logs, as we have grown to expect with games since the days of MUDs.\n\n- System messages and quest text are also not logged, so if you miss some information it's just gone.\n\n- MANY people have complained (in the short time I played) about the salvaging mission being nearly impossible to complete, due to the poorly developed UI. The developer doesn't see this as his problem, rather as the player's lack of skill. It is 100% a game design issue (lay folk didn't have any issues with SWG Jump to Lightspeed quests, in my several years of experience helping people in that game... because the UI was made by professionals).\n\nThe Good:\n\n- It's a PvE game and you can't even accidentally die or lose your ship.\n\n- The mining and commodity trading mini games are well done.\n\n- If you enjoy playing "Space Trucker", then this game is worth looking at. You can make lots of credits just auto piloting from place to place, buying low and selling high as you go.\n\n- It's not utterly awful, but it's not good either. It would make a fine open source game that people could dabble in and submit patches for, but it isn't something that I would feel comfortable charging money for had it been one of the games I made; it shouldn't be a commercial product.\n\nLesson learned: Don't spend money on "indie games". The hype is real...\n\nWARNING: Steam will not give you refund if you play long than 2 hours. It took me several hours of reading and tinkering just to figure out what to do...","April 22","false","12.6"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

Tutorial missions will guide you at first, and it's definitely worth it to complete these as they will give you access to a plot of land to place some mines on, a Star Base in which you can construct components necessary to colonize worlds, build ships, etc.\n\nThe game universe consists of a small core of 9 NPC run inner planets.  Each planet is in a system, and you travel between them using gates.\n\nOutside of that is when the game really begins... as there are millions of unexplored star systems out there.  Players can explore, colonize worlds and build colonies producing minerals, food, alcohol, etc.  Construction of Gates between these systems are large cooperative projects, but there are many already in place and more planned.\n\nWhich brings me to the community.  The player community in Ascent is fantastic.  I've rarely felt at home in a game like I do in Ascent.  Certainly one of the big selling points to me.\n\nAnother positive for me is that PVP is not really an issue.  Roughly a quarter of the Galaxy is designated for the "Red Zone", which is the only place PvP can take place (it wasn't in effect at the time of this review).\n\nThe game is still in development... changes come often.  New ships, new asteroids to mine, new things to build with new minerals, smuggling is soon to be added, and PvE combat will be a priority after that.\n\nFor the price, I don't think you can go wrong.  Yes there is a small (and I do mean small) monthly fee for advanced features, but the game comes with three months for free which you can activate when you want.\n\nSo if the thought of getting into a ship and exploring, mining, colonizing untamed worlds, etc... while interacting with an outstanding gaming community, appeals to you... then you just can't go wrong with Ascent the Space Game.\n","September 7, 2015","true","617.2"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

For an early access game, i can tell you it's not a waste of money. I am happy with the amount of content this game has so far. The "one man dev team" does a good job at adding new material and fixing bugs with each patch. I for one want to be a part of watching this game continue to grow and develop. I am excited about the future of Ascent. In my 40 hours of playing, i have seen a steady increase in player population. The game is definitely heading in the right direction. Now if this "one man dev team" can pick up a few more team members that share the same vision.....well hell, this could be my next addiction. I know my $20 went towards a gem in the making. Dont get all sore about the small monthly fee ( optional ) for the premium account. You can still do almost everything in the game without it. I for one, will have no prob paying the 5 or 6 dollars a month extra so i can use mining beams higher than class 5 or make my space station larger or what not.  I have a job, i work for a living. I too, need money to maintain. So please dont let that discourage you from buying this game.  Ascent-The Space Game is a must buy for anyone who has ever played ANY space game before this. This Dev has a dream....and im excited to see it brought to life little by little. Grats go out to the "one man dev team"!!!

I cannot get enough of this game !!\n\nThe section where i get to brag about this game, because i am proud that i am apart of the Ascent Universe.\n\nAscent is the 1st space sandbox that i have played that Actually get the sandbox part right. Except for the inner 9 systems, EVERYTHING is player made, EVERYTHING is discovered by players... , Gates, Colonies, Ships, Star Bases, everything. The economy, even the politics are player driven.\n\nSo what can you do in the game ? Anything you want. There is nothing stopping you to just explore or to become a pure Gate Builder, want to create a giant empire .. go for it, just want to mine or only build ships, its all there you choose your own path. There are no skill trees or training that limit your path it is open and you can play the game anyway you like.\n\nOne of the 1st things that caught my attention was the community. The Ascent community is like no other MMO i have played. The community is extremely helpfull and friendly.\n\nIf you like pve orientated (There will be pvp comming but it will not be the main focus of the game), sapce game, where the universe is the literally the limit this is the game for you.\n\nThere is a sub of $3 a month to unlocak all the premium content. $3 ? that is NOTHING !! My sub is paid all the way to 2017. what can you buy for $3 .. a burger ? Now you can be part of one of the best space MMO's ever created.

It encourages Exploration, Colonization, Research, Asteroid mining, Farming, Trading, and Combat."\n\n-Strong Sci-fi? You can have different opinion.\n\n-Exploration? Ok, you jump into an unknown system and do sampling and research with a computer from late 70's. You have to type everything because there is no graphic interface. You find different kinds of systems, some has valuable asteroid fields which you can farm to give better yields. Planets are different and there's gas giants also for fuel scooping and grinding gas for selling.\n\n-Colonization? Ok, you may colonize planets with or without domes depenging of the atmosphere. This may be the only aspect of the game which is not grinding 24/7 (unless you bring a huge amount of NPC passengers as workers depending of the size of your colony. Note: You have to buy them from Inner Stations, which makes them slaves?).\n\n-Research?  At start you search wrecks for blueprint fractions, or buy full bluprints from stations. Then you have to "research" them in your research facility. Then you can upgrade your earlier research. This can take very very long, like weeks. Not very high end research system.\n\n-Asteroid mining, this is what I like, best mining system to date and you can farm asteroids to give better yields.\n\n-Farming? Yep, asteroids. I can't really say farming when you place a farm and then your warehouse magically get flled with grain, fruits, meat and vegetables\n\n-Trading? So boring trading system. Everybody makes same ♥♥♥♥ so who is buying? And if you make ships there will always be some people who gives ships for free or minimal fee so why buy ships? Only trading system worth making money is grind grind grind grind grind carbon from colonies to Inner Stations. Fun? NO!! It would be more fun if Hyperjumping wasn't so annoying with flashing white lights that you had to be braindead not having a seizure.\n\n-Combat? That was so awkward I decided not take part at it.","May 28","false","359.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I'm in the red, if you add it all up, probably not what where you want to be a few months before your 40th birthday, but as I said to a colleague in the middle of an all night coding binge:\n\n"I would rather go bust making something special, than get rich developing something 'meh'."\n\nAnd I think that just about sums up the Fluffy Kitten Studios philosophy, for now. The company is not in great shape. Sales until now have slowed to a crawl. I think people are thoroughly sick of buying early access games in general, and Steam is now absolutely flooded with indie titles all vying for the same market. The number of games has grown at a pace that leaves the market growth for dead, and the vast majority of our potential playerbase has still never heard of us (this became abundantly clear at PAX, where most people we met were Australian - and we've had some press traction here - and almost none had heard of us).\n\nWe now have over 19,000 people who has wishlisted Ascent who haven't bought it yet. We expect a small portion of those to buy it when we "release" (steam has just begun emailing wishlisters when a game comes out of early access, fortuitous timing for us) but we will also need some action from the press to sustain development for the rest of the year.\n\nAnd that about sums it up. It is now very much crunch time for Ascent and Fluffy Kitten Studios. There is no chance the company will fold or the game will end (I still run it on a test server at home and it's fine. I could operate it for you with NO income), but there is also no chance I will be 100% full time on the game any more in May or June if we can't FINALLY get some press traction and make some significant sales.\n\nSo, everything now hinges on what happens on April 11 and the following few weeks. Fingers crossed our press release gets through this time.\n\nFrom the Developer's mouth.  What 3 Dev's are working on this game? Bull crap!. 3 devs have worked on this game in the past but NOT anymore.  The game will NOT be developed anymore unless the STEAM sales makes it so and look at the steam forums a few noobs and a few fan boy's.  You will get tired of mining, trading and building colonies btw the graphics for the colonies is early 1990's. $20 bucks is a total rip off, even at 50% off its more of a waste of your time. Maybe if this was made 15 years ago it might be worth some time but with games today why in the hell would you play this one.\n\nThe bad ........\n\nThe state of the Company. Nuff said.\n\nThe good......\n\nWhen you uninstall it and make better use of your game time.\n\n","April 26","false","35.6"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","11","20","2","2"

Ex. Having reached Midshipman rank at this point, as long as you keep an eye on your armor and center the reticles on the target, you can survive a battle with pirates in the border system(s) where they can be found.\n\nThe only other negative worth mentioning  which occurs on a regular basis is that not all of the wreck debris that appears is retrieveable/scanable. One piece which resembles a ship from the old Bablyon 5 series, no matter the acceptable range, is able to be scanned/retrieved.","October 10, 2015","true","255.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Loads of fun, 270 BILLION procedurely generated systems/planets to explore and colonise.  Lots of things to craft, but therein lies the problem... the grinding...\n\nIf you ever played Life is Feudal you will know what this game is like...Its a straight up grind fest to the point you really contemplate on whether if there is any point to continue ...  Most people want to explore, find and name a system themselves but you cant till you can acquire the proper ship and resources to do so... to get to that point you have to grind and grind and grind and grind and grind, and grind and grind daily on every little thing you do... To research up say mining beams from class 1-12 takes like 100+ days minimum let alone anything above class 12...  not to mention the hundred other modules, or processes you will need to level up.\n\nThere are players who have been playing since the kickstarter some 2 years and are still researching things in game... it just seems like everything you research takes 24 hours.... And you have huge lists of things you need researched to be able to craft/sell/use etc....  This is not a game for the casual gamer or person who has a steady job...  Its a fun game but in its current state at the time of me writing this the grind times are just not properly balanced and take to long to allow you to get out and really do the fun stuff comparitively speaking....   It almost seems the grind times are to make up for the lack of content and i do hope jam plans on changing that... i do recommend the game but only if you have butt loads of time to devote to it or you will be disappointed.\n\nBugs/ issues at time of this review that stand out to me:\n\n1. vanishing asteroids just as you mine them\n2. poor key binding options\n3.  UI still needs work to be made user friendly\n4.  More available "add alias" needed\n5. mouse wheel zoom speed needs to be increased\n6. all ships need additional thrusters for 6dof and not just fwd thrust\n7. increased purple contracts needed\n8. better pricing on contracts especially if you took the time to build the ceres farm or other mines\n9. Need a way to close the game properly (see #3)\n10. Need better audio settings\n11.  If your starbase warehouse has all materials needed to build a new module you shouldnt have to transfer it to your ship to just supply the module to start construction... the warehouse should be able to feed everything on the SB at all times.\n12.  in game help file needs updated bad\n13.  Grind times- just need balancing for fun/achievement\n14. In game chat could use some updates like pm's...block user, add friend with color tags or something etc ...\n\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nI do plan to continue playing as i am having fun but im also frustrated knowing i have another month of nonstop grinding before im self sufficient enough to be able to afford to start doing the really fun stuff like exploring.  I understand this is very early in its release and is why im still going to play to see how things pan out.\n\n","March 14, 2015","true","531.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","2"

Most of the bugs seem to be related to graphics and updating on screen information, which isn't a big deal since it is not causing me to much grief, the game does crash from time to time, usually after three to four hours of continuous play, restarting and logging back in seems to fix the issue and does not do it again.\n\nThe trading, mining, and settlement building is fun if not a little tedious. Exploring new star systems is a great feature, knowing that no one else has ever been there is nice if not making you feel a little lonely in the vastness of space. The game world is so large i don't think the word "vast" would cover it.\n\nThe ability to out fit your ship with what type of hyperdrive/warp drive/ shield etc. is very nice, being able to use NPC traders to move your goods around is also useful for when you are not online, first few days of play are the most time consuming. But once you are up and running you can make large sums of money to easily and money pretty much becomes useless at a certain point.\n\nOverall a solid game with large potential especially for being only in alpha.","May 31, 2015","true","50.5"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

All the mining you do on your colony is of no use and just piles up. All the gates you create... for what??? Takes 100million tons and 30,000 round trips and for what?

A True sandbox space (I don't even know how to classify the type of game this is because it feels like we can do anything we want... explore, trade, colonize uncharted planets, improve yourship for combat, etc).\n\nMy ship's on board computer has a commandline that allows us to set parameters (quite frankly this was totally unexpected for me, and it adds to the cool factor for me).\n\nThere is trade, there is massive exploration opportunities, probably more starsystems than will ever possibly be explored even if this game is around for 20 years.  100s of billiions of stars out there, and we can set up a colony and our own space station eventually.  I'm impressed.\n\nThis game appears to have all the features I've always wanted in a space game, and I was shocked at how easy it is to get the hang of.  Although I heard from others using the interstellar communications that the further along we are in the game the more complex it gets.  So I asked them that even if it gets complex can I just still choose to explore, and be mellow.  They said yes this is a sandbox.  They said we could just do the tutorial and take it as slow as we want.\n\nAlso it was a nice suprise that ships do not expend energy unless you use hyperdrive to travel to stars without a jump gate.  I also couldn't wreck my ship by crashing into the space station (which was nice since I didn't realize all I had to do was use autopilot to dock my ship).  In any case this is totally up my alley since I don't like micromanaging fuel while still learning a game.  We can keep flying from station to sation, mine, land on planets explore without fear of crashing and blowing up, or running out of fuel until we are ready to go out and take on more deadly stuff.\n\nI don't know folks but this game seems like it is like a real universe.  I read all that stuff on the website about the graphics needing to be better and stuff, but I'm impressed at how immersive this game is and the graphics aren't an issue with me at all.  It also said they were working on improving combat (I honestly haven't tried combat yet, but the list of controlls seem simple enough).  This is still just early access so I totally don't expect this to be feature complete, but my goodness I'm glad I got this game!  I definitely recommend, and I'm not some long term fan boy that is biased about this game.

If you work with me I will send you regular, clearly written, and absolutly coherent reports on each patch or fix you have me implement. I am supporting you with the purchase of this space-sim in progress, support me back by allowing me to help with the developement of this simulation, and I think the Sky will not even be the limit... Some developers ignore offers like this, other take offers like this sincerely, and they end up producing works like IL-2 Sturmovik 1946, or The Witcher Series !

Unique, adventurous, complex. These are just a few things to describe Ascent - The Space Game. If these developers follow through like they have, I think we'll see the next MMO to revolutionize the industry of online gaming. I think this game should be featured everywhere. Beware! Understand that this is alpha and as such it should be expected that some things are more than likely limited and progression can be reset. I think any alpha tester that supports a game and provides assistance to the developer will benefit the community and game. So, just sit back, relax, absorb as much information about the game as you can and give feed back. Enjoy yourself too! With a good following, the game has potential to be something very great.

I recommend that you try this game.\n\nWhen you buy the game via steam you get 3 months premium bundled with your purchase.  This "premium" enables you to  build a colony outside the "inner 9" which is what the central hub of the game is called.  And several other things.\n\nMy suggestion is to not activate your premium untill you have played a while, as it is not required untill you get into the later stages of the game.\n\nThe game is under constant development.  Jam, the dev is constantly updating the game. (I think he never takes a break.)  Most patches are small, in the 8mb size range.\n\nThe graphics are really good and constantly being updated and expanded.\n\nThe Gameplay... It is so extensive that I probably have not experienced 20% of what you can achieve.  My experience has so far been mining, trading and doing contracts.  There are colonies and settlements, but I only have a single Settlement from the tutorial missions.\n\nThe gameplay is progressive.  As you get a bigger ship the contracts and items available to you also increase.\n\nI am someone who likes to read about the bad points of a game as well as the good points of a game...  So i will try and point out some bad things as well. :P\n\nCons :\n\nThere are bugs still in the game.\n- Some contracts do not accept correctly.\n- Changing ships means you have to undock and dock again to update the ship info.\n- The start of the game is slow to get yourself some money...  The first mission outside the "inner 9" takes an age to earn the money for.\n- Purchasing your first few ships takes forever. :)\n- sometimes the autopilot button might not work, possibly requires a restart.\n- complex command system for computers.  (some may not get the hang of it easily.)\n\nBut even the few cons are minor things, that Jam the dev is working on to fix.\n\nOverall this game is well worth purchasing.  It has alot of potential.","March 25, 2015","true","413.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

(And I'm a grinder)  I usually love chasing the carrot for days or weeks to get some small achievemnet or betterment.  I never saw the carrot in this game. Not sure there is one.\n\nOthers have done a much better job pointing out the problems with this game, so I'll leave it there.","April 13","false","14.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

I've steadily been getting more and more addicted.  Yes, this game has PLENTY of bugs.  Yes, there are things in it not feature complete coming out of early access.  Yes, it is VERY rough around the edges graphically and UI wise.  But it is still attempting something that no other space game has done to date, and with only 1 guy developing it.\n\nSo I must preface my main points with this: If you can't handle bugs that cause the game to crash, delete your colony buildings, or cause your fps to drop below 20 due to memory leaks, DO NOT play this.  You will rage quit.\n\nI'm still learning the intricacies of this game.  But it's fairly massive in scope.  You will spend many hours learning how to build colonies and work on your personal starbase.  If you follow the tutorial you should be fine.  The game needs alot of work even coming out of early access.  You will get glitchy graphics here and there.  Pirate AI vessel's will usually glitch out and constantly ram your ship, making it easy to dispatch them because they just keep moving forward in front of you and not shooting their weapons.  So yeah, shooting them is really easy when they're a foot in front of your nose.\n\nThis game was made to build colonies and starbases with.  It has a HUGE universe.  Something like 250 billion planets.  Each new system you warp to is procedurally generated.   You can land on all the planets in the game.  Something that Elite Dangerous doesn't have yet and wont have for awhile.\n\nSo keep in mind what I said.  This game was made to build colonies on planets.  The rest of the game isn't fully fleshed out yet.  If you want to make money, buy a bigger ship, strip it, and just mine asteroids all day or collect gas from outer bases, then sell.  Combat will get you some decent money as well because the ships are glitched right now and pose very little threat.\n\nThis game is a carebear game.  You can't lose your ship or die, ever.  If your health gets too low, the ship computer auto warps you out of the combat area.  You don't even fight other enemy ships unless you're in ONE particular system.  So taking all that into consideration, you can tell the developer wanted this to be a colony crafting space game with some minor combat content.\n\nYou have various skills that improve with use.  I love this skill system and wish more MMO's used it.  The better the skill is, the more money you'll make while doing that activity.  Unfortunatly combat doesn't have any skills as far as I can tell.  Only gas harvesting, mining, trading and colony maintenance.\n\nThe colony system is very in depth.  Crafting buildings on planets comes with alot of maintenance on your part.  The people will need food stores and other various activities to maintain morale.  On the flip side, the colonies will produce resources for you.  You can land on your colonies and the colonies of others, get out of your ship and do things like take soil samples, visit another players nightclub or bar and recruit NPC's to fly your ships for you, etc.  Colony expansion is the reason to play Ascent.  It IS the endgame.  Ascent is primarily all about colony construction and building outer starbases throughout the universe to expand the dwindling human race.\n\nOuter planet colonization is much differant than inner 9 colony maintenance.  Think of the inner 9 planets as the starting worlds all noobs visit to learn the game.  Outer planets require environmental domes to sustain life on them, unless they have oxygen and nitrogen in the atmosphere, otherwise, they are like any earth like planet.\n\nAll the jump gates in game were created by other players.  So if you want to explore, you need a hyperdrive.  So the player base is pretty nice from what I've seen and help players get hyperdrives for cheap.  THere are players here that have played Ascent for over 2 years now.  So the jump gates are pretty common in the core worlds.\n\nThe dev is planning on implementing pvp in a certain zone and that's all.   This game, again, is primarily to avoid gankers.  So if you're coming here from Eve Online and want to screw with people, you won't get that chance here.\n\nThis game has a few broken features, like combat.  So the only other thing to do to make money is trade carbon from one system to another.  Making money is soooooo easy once you get to a class 8 or 9 ship. You will be making upwards of 92 mil/hr just trading from one system to another. It's ridiculously easy. I'm in a class 13 ship at the time of this review, and am making 3 billion credits per hour hauling carbon.  The game turns into a time waster grinding money for hours to get a bigger ship to make even more money.  Like I said above however, this game is all about rebuilding humanity one colony at a time.  So the players base is supposed to work together to build bases and colonies on all the planets and build star gates so travel is easier. That, is end game.\n\n\nMy review/impression video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edIUFUcqV-o","April 25","true","42.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I can only add that this game has more bugs than a junkyard dog with flees,It reminded of the late 90's when every pencil necked programming geek wanted to make a quick buck to get into the PC gaming rush.Most were never even gamers & u could easily tell by the amount of horrible games that sprung out at that time.\nTo expand on some of the others comments :\nResearch is ridiculous what should take hours actualy takes days  & worst no way to improve it ROFL.(Except to sign on to another alt and pay another sub fee :(Never gonna happen cause this game will never see anymore money from me thats for sure.Just so you understand i have been paying for World of Warcraft for over 4 years Sub & still paying, worth every penny!!!\nI think the biggest scam i saw was that new people were given free or cheap upgrades in the game as to lull them into believing this is a great game & community I played the game with out such obvious tactics cause thats the only way to see if i would like it. This clearly is a way to get people to make a quick positive comment without even putting in any effort. ( Give me money instead & i would still toss this Turd into the Dung Heap. )\nI want my 19.99 Back cause the free version never played for me & I made the mistake in believing all the fluff in positive comments.(Now i read the negative first ! )\nI will have 2nd thoughts about ever buying a Early access game again. o/","April 18, 2015","false","199.5"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","6","14","0","0"

I can go mine, build colony, explore, etc..and not have to worry about being PKed by others with much better equipment. It seems so many games now have this PK to win built into them. For a casual player, there is no way to keep up. Not in this game though. None of that here..just fun!\n\nThis game is about building things alone or with others, not destroying things, and killing defenseless players, like so many other games are now. Very refreshing and relaxing to play.\n\nThe community has been very, very helpful. If you have a question, you just ask in the "Help" channel. Do not forget to help others in that channel too. Chat is mostly very possitive, and not intentionally misleading, or filled with Trolls as other games today are.\n\nIf you put in the effort to accomplish, you will.\n\nThe subscription rate for Premium is very cheap.

Nice and helpful community. If you ever played X2: The Threat you will have no problem learning this game I don't think. Very similar influence.

Mining is actually much more fun than other space sims. Mostly this game is about the community and working together to achieve goals in the game. I am not sure if there is any combat yet or PvP but this is EA and there will be some added soon in certain sectors to create some conflict regarding resources and such, but will be optional. This game focus more on PvE factors and repopulating the universe with industry, trade, and manufacturing. It is a relaxing game, a little on the light side of adventuring, but there is plenty to do: missions, trading, hauling, exploring, building, settling, colinization, and eventually bounty hunting pirates and such.

Also there is fighting on the side of this game's mechanics. So far I find this game pretty interesting. At times it may become a little boring but thats ok. This game is in early accses and the creators will adding things later. BUY THIS GAME!","June 28, 2015","true","4.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

There is no PVP right now but the dev is working on it and with time you will have sectors dedicated for PVP protecting those players from PVP in other sectors. So the PVE crowd will be pleased, the game has still a long way of improvements and the devs are always working to fix the bugs. There is an option to play the game for free after buying it here and then is the other option to subscribe for like $3 a month that gives you more freedom int he building of colonies and Star bases.

If you can look pass it and want to play for months before reaching class 14 ships, or pay 80 bucks on top of the the game price and minor subscription.\n\nIt's impossible to lose your ships or get them destroyed, so gameplay challenge is very low to none.\n\nEach class progression basically doubles in cost from the previous, higher level parts can take as much as a month to research, thus one main reason p2w ships can save months of gameplay, unless you find a player who can provide the parts.\n\nEconomy is synthetic, prices are randomly generated every 15 minutes. so you may have 1% profit margin one minute and 40% profit margin the next without any player interaction. So there's no economy system in place yet.\n\nThere is little to no ship customization as far as what you can put on it, you can choose to go with lighter weight lower class modules lower than the ships class to make room for more space to trade. There is customizations for how the ship looks available I think...\n\nThe graphics and UI has greatly improved over the last year, a lot of improvements.\n\nI will however never recommend this game solely because of the p2w ships. They should never have been sold in the first place as far as I'm concerned. This could have been a great game without their interference, nearly all player constucted stargates shouldn't even exist because of these ships. I have no respect for the developer for selling these ships, nor will I support the game.

The community is awsome as well the peeps in ATSG are awsome.  The biggest negative I can say is on the UI,  the UI is not user effecient and there are alot of commands for the game aspects that you have to type in manually or make whats called an alias for the command.

PVP Combat will be limited to areas and will only be between people that want to fight. That is a paraphrased quote from the developer. Combat seems to be shaping up to be something that will be a little more deliberate, not a quick one shot.\nPVE may be more widespread but i doubt it will be a serious threat.\nGo read the forums, watch videos on the game, read the wiki.","August 16, 2015","true","008.6"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","17","1","6","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/overene/recommended/345010/","overene","Neurodice","http://steamcommunity.com/id/overene/","11 products in account","Before you mindlessly give this a thumbs down, keep reading because I provide evidence to many of the points I make here, It's also worth noting that I've played this game for longer than just about any active player except one that I can name.\n\n-Pay $3 a month for premium which is required for many important in-game features. Pay either $25 or $90 dollars for some horrifically overpriced and downright bad ships. If you pay for a while than stop, you will gradually lose everything you worked for. How to get it back, pay for some of it, but the rest of it is gone for good.\n\n-Ignorant and deceptive developer. Continue reading and you'll see why.\n\n-The community seems nice at first, but they are really just desperate for new players and in truth many members of the community can be very hostile. I have gotten threats for saying publicly that I seeing this game die would be quite amusing. That's my opinion, and because of it someone told me to go f*ck myself.\nYou can look in negative threads on the discussions part of the community hub and you'll likely see some.\nAlso, here's one of the more aggressive ones I've recieved by someone named Worm, who I believe got that name when they were looking for something to compare their intelligence to:  http://imgur.com/I1YdRhV\nIn that screenshot, I said that the game's ratings are going to go to complete hell when the full release happens. Of course that never happened because the game apparently got little to no publicity during the full release.\n\n-Even the new person they hired to model the ships still does a poor job. I wouldn't consider them better even, they just look different. Maybe they'd be good if they actually had some level of detail.\n\n-Almost every new update is so broken that it makes you wonder if the developer actually tests it or puts effort into it, which he clearly doesn't. He has talked about how great he is of a developer, while there is literally nothing about Ascent that makes it better than any other game. Take NPCs for example. They randomly get stuck in isolated systems where you can't get them out, they randomly break, they in general are a huge pain in the ♥♥♥, and on top of that they are almost useless because of how they were implemented. You give your ship to them (which they won't give back) and then you make them haul from stock market to stock market, while traveling at a fraction of the speed of a normal player. and also the price of normal ships makes it only a viable source of credits for the extremely rich. There's also the very abusable boomerang which has atleast a dozen unfixed bugs, one of which is very, very abusable. Continue reading if you want to know what it is.\n\n-Probably the grindiest game I've played in my life. That's how the developer makes up for the vast lack of content. Many of the positive reviews will tell you how rediculously fast it is to get credits. What they mean by "rediculously fast" is *only* about several days of solid grinding to get a new ship. How someone could even consider that to be fast is beyond me. Not to mention you have to grind for just about everything. The (maybe) bright side? There's multiple ways to grind. You can either mine asteroids or haul carbon between colonies. Sounds fun... [/sarcasm]\n\n-The developer is downright stupid. I replied to an infraction he sent me saying "rip" and he almost banned me both ingame and on the forums for threatening him. Guess we have finally figured out that he is autistic. After all, he kind of looked like he was anyway, especially with that nightmare of a hairstyle plus a face that is practically painted pink with zits. Not even just acne, but full sized zits. He says I'm misleading people by saying he's ignorant even though I can very easily prove that he is. There are several well known abusable bugs that I think still exist within the game and the developer hasn't done anything against them, or atleast not since I last checked. In fact, I'll let you in on one. Normally, getting your gas giant skimming level to level 100+ can take hours, days or even weeks. No need to fear. Just stuff a bunch of ships onto a boomerang carrier and plunge into a gas giant to repeatedly skim over and over again without needing to leave the gas giant like you would normally.. I raised my skimming level to 120 just by leaving the game running all day, not to mention I got thousands of rare gasses from it, enough for a single gate within a matter of hours if you regularly put your gasses into storage when your cargo hold gets full. Also, you can buy colonists for your colony when you have no money. See, these are two of the more abusable ones. Just to be clear, I DID report them I believe or someone else likely did, but did they get fixed? Nope. In fact I'd be secretive about the boomerang skimming one but I know that Jam wouldn't read this and he even told me it was a "feature" when I reported a similar bug in the past, back in the day when he actually read all of the bug reports. It didn't get the attention of the developer for several days even when I accidentally caused a small revolt in the discussions part of the community hub.\n\n-The community is very confusing. Much of the community claims to be older, around their 30s to 70s, but at the same time, much of the community is surprisingly illiterate. Oh yeah, they also treat their kids like dogs. They sometimes say something along the lines of "brb gotta feed the kids" and they come back literally 3 minutes later. Did you feed them hot pockets?? Chicken nuggets maybe? Whatever it is, I feel pretty damn awful for your kids who are probably fat and with diabetes.  Wouldn't surprise me if they were all passionate trump supporters, because they sure act like they could be.","April 26","false","363.1"," 5 of 25 people (20%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","20","5","25","6","24"

The game is pretty addicting.\nIt has it's flaws but satisfies the need for a space sim.\nI'll say though that it's impressive, given the fact that it's the work of a few people.\n","April 23","true","255.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But I just can't.\n\nMy original review said that this was a great game, and I still stand by it, but they did exactly what I was hoping they wouldn't: they released too soon. The game was great for a beta, but not for a fully released game.\n\nIn my earlier review, I sorta skated over all the negative aspects of the game (glitches, akward gameplay, tedious monotony) because I was seriously hoping that they would be fixed BEFORE release, but they weren't. They did fix a few things, such as the UI isn't as butt ugly as it once was, but that's about it.\n\nMany aspects of this game just feel unfinished, unpolished, glitchy, and clunky. Not to mention the completely unbalanced economic system. New players into this game will never be able to match the prices of some of the veterans. Ever. Including those that haven't played in *literally* months. The veteran players' automatic systems keep racking them in money over time selling at prices you'll never see a profit from.\n\nThis game isn't even in beta, it's in alpha. He's still adding features to it without fixing some of the bugs and glitches that are already in the game. I know how it feels to work solely on bugs and glitches, it's incredibly boring and tedious. This game was made by one guy and he'd rather work on adding more fun and exciting features. I get that. I really do, but this game just isn't finished. It's not polished enough to take it out of early access. This is literally the first thing I tried to warn him about in the original post of this review. He released to soon and it's score is plummeting because of it.\n\nPlaying this game right now is extremely frustrating. I want to like it I want to like it I want to like it, but I can't. It'll take some major updates to change this review from a negative back to a positive again.\n\nP.S. After reading some posts on the forums, Jam (the developer) has all but run out of money and time for this game. So I doubt it'll ever be fixed enough for me to change my mind once again. ;_;","September 11, 2015","false","43.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","20"
