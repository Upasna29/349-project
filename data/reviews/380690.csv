That's a seriously impressive balance to achieve, and if you have any idea what I'm talking about so far you should probably just pick up this game right now.\n\nDon'yoku; the last of the manly shooters!","September 19, 2015","true","5.3"," 31 of 38 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","31","38","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/UnforgivenCaleb/recommended/380690/","UnforgivenCaleb","UnforgivenCaleb","http://steamcommunity.com/id/UnforgivenCaleb/","768 products in account","A really challenging bullet-hell game (I can't even get past Level 2. That's how hard this game is!). It's pretty easy to get into, definitely in the vein of classics like DonPachi and GunBird. There are a few problems, however. Mainly involving the interface. Every time you start the game, the Steam Overlay pops up. Hopefully this will be fixed in a later update. Another issue is the controller support. While it IS present, you have to go into the Dip Switches on the main menu and set the controls to the joystick (You can also choose between 2- and 3-button controls; for instance in 2-button mode, you rapidly tap the fire button for normal shot and hold it for the laser attack, while 3-button has the shot and laser as separate buttons, which I prefer). Probably the biggest gripe is that there is no free-play option. 3 credits. That's it. No additional credits, no extra lives. Nothing. You want to play to the end? You'd better get really good at the game. Genre veterans probably won't mind, but everyone else will. Those gripes aside, this is a decent shmup. Genre purists will definitely enjoy this game. Everyone else... wait for a discount or look elsewhere.","August 3, 2015","true","4.8"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

You know, the one that gorged itself on the pocket change of the unwary and stubborn; the one that had even the guy with seemingly superhuman coordination and reflexes sweating during the early levels. If you were that guy, Don’Yoku will reveal whether you’ve still “got it.” If you were the bystander who could barely surmount stage one, then Don’Yoku is your chance for redemption. Whatever your goal and whatever the outcome, you’re going to have fun.\n\nThis is a brutal but enjoyable game: tough but fair. The first stage mercilessly showers you with bullets. The second? Ditto. The third? Same. The fourth? Guess. The fifth? Good luck getting there. As you make progress, Don’Yoku will pour on the rain in increasingly dense patterns, and you’ll love every minute of it. Controls are just about as tight and responsive as possible, so as much as you might curse the game when death comes (and it will), deep down you’ll know the real reason you keep eating bullets is poor plane placement and/or slow reaction time. Granted, upon first encounter, some patterns will appear impossible to dodge. In these instances, Don’Yoku’s weapon mechanics serve as a buffer. Strategic use of your arsenal can extend your survivalbility by quite a bit.\n\nYou are given three planes to choose from, and each comes with a standard machine gun, an energy beam, and a Don’Yoku attack (basically, a bomb). Damaging enemies with the machine gun fills the Don’Yoku counter (i.e. gauge) for the Don'Yoku attack; whereas, the energy beam causes slight slowdown of onscreen action and converts kills to coins for increased score. A huge part of surviving in Don’Yoku involves efficient swapping of the the weaker machine gun and the more powerful beam, as well as juggling Don’Yoku energy stocking with Don'Yoku attack striking. Do this balancing act well and combine it with effective dodging, and your plane can endure a beating.\n\nAll in all, great gameplay and cool presentation makes Don'Yoku a must-have for bullet hell aficionados.","July 27, 2015","true","5.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Three characters to choose from, each with a singificantly different playstyle.  Multiple difficulty levels, the lowest of which should allow even casual players to see most of the game.\n\nVery pretty pixel art and beautiful cabinet-style sidebars.\n\nControls are slightly unresponsive, but not so much as to detract from the game.  If you ever played an old arcade game with a well-maintained but 'sticky' joystick (pizza parlor Raiden), that's what it feels like.\n\nA few caveats:\n\nDon'Yoku is full screen by default and I haven't found a way to run it windowed.\n\nMore importantly, this game is shackled with the WORST default keybindings I have EVER seen.  At first, I was convinced the controls were broken.\n\nNot only are the default bindings unintuitive (WASD + BNM, Controller support in menu only, no analog stick support, keyboard arrow keys do nothing), but they're also inconsistent.\n\nIt took a while, but once I'd set controls to joystick and rebound the action buttons, I had a great time with this game.\n\nHighly recommended, IF you either have a gamepad and reconfigure the controls, OR don't mind a WASD keyboard setup.","October 4, 2015","true","6.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","4"

It's a good attempt at a Cave style STG, but doesn't really do it for me.\n\nAlso, analogue control on 360 pad doesn't work forcing you to use D-pad, and both my digital and analogue arcade\nsticks don't work with it either.\n","October 3, 2015","false","0.1"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

Actually looks pretty good in my native res of 2560x1080, quite surprised honestly. Now the bad, the controls are wierd, WADS? and only D-pad control? like already pointed out, not being able to use the analog stick or a fight stick is very odd since the developers did put a lot of time and love into this, why did they not include that? I got it for $2, definitely worth it, but not the full retail price. I LOVE ShmUPs, and this a good one for my library but I sure am glad I waited, after playing it it not worth any more than $5, so just be patient and wait for a good deal. IF the controls were better(more options) I'd give it a 4/5, but as it stands its a 3/5. Its due to the controls I can't recommend it, maybe there will be a patch then I'll definitely change my recommendation, but until that time, its a no go.","October 10, 2015","false","4.8"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","6"

There are still a few small issues that need to be worked out (mainly relating to the ability to use the analog stick on 360 pads) -- but the developers have been VERY *prompt* AND *active* in the community, responding to bug reports and having patches out within days at most.  And, they've assured us that the next patch will address ALL of our control issues!\n\nThe game itself is a pixel-art, tate, Japanese style shoot-em-up --  and it really has a lot of character and style.  The ONLY negative at all at present is the control issues, but I've found that using my arcade stick (and JoyToKey) has proved to be a working temporary fix.\n\nI really expect to see this one veer into "Positive" soon -- especially once the control fixes are patched!  All in all, I've found it to be a very fun, original, and aesthetically pleasing shoot-'em-up!","November 8, 2015","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
