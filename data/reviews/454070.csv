Maybe put it a step up? Like Ultra-high or something.\n\nAlso, the main problem I have with this game is the exploration, exploring is a pain because you're gonna have trouble getting to areas because of the character stopping at areas. Also, the characters cannot drop. You can't fall at all, so trying to fall, you won't be allowed to do that. Trying to go down a mountain? You can't do that, you have to go around, through the enemies.\n\nThe last problem is night, Night looks very very bad. Change the sky from brown to black, also while on a ship, the islands look very blue-ish, change this too.\nHonestly, the lag is the last of my issues. At this stage, I'm still having a VERY fun time on this game, I find it a great time wasting tool, just focus on what I've said, and your game could outstand many others on early access.\n\nI'm recommending this mainly because of the cheap price, if it were $10 - $20 I'd probably say no. But at this price it's worth it, get some more work done, and maybe it could be worth around $20, I hope this helped.\n\nThanks ~Vezmarok","May 9","true","2.2"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

First off let me say that this game is still in very early access.  Also even when playing local your internet connection must be stable for you to play.  I found this out the first few times I was trying to play and I had something downloading in the background.   I disabled the background download and then was able to connect with the local server.  I have plans on picking up another copy for my daughter for us to play LAN with once I try it out some more.\n\nAs of this writing I have about 90 minutes in the game.   I will say at this point don't go into the game expecting any fancy graphics, currently they are very bare bones.  Your character is going to look off, but I am sure that will vastly improve over time.  Also there isn't any hand holding in the game yet.  You are going to have to experiment.\n\nOne of the things I found out very quickly is that there are a mixture of mobs all around.  You might be fighting a level 3 Zombie one moment and then a level 15 Zombie Lord shows up.  The first time or two this happened I had my butt handed to me but I quickly learned the game is currently all about kiting.  Once I started doing this I was very easily able to takle mobs way above my level.  At level 5 a level 18 witch wasn't much problem as long as I paid attension to the attack queues.\n\nOne of the things that took a minute to get used to but now I love is that this isn't like WoW, you don't lock onto a mob.  You have to manually make sure your spells are aimed at the mob.  Missing is a very easy prospect if you are not careful.  But I like this as it adds some more realism (well when talking a fantasy game, as much as it can be I guess).  Still if you learn to kite and watch the attack warnings you can easily kite a much level mob without much problem.\n\nPerformance wise, the game is what you would expect for a $5 game that has just been released to early access, however I didn't have many performance issues that were not network related.  The rig I played on was an i7-860 2.8ghz, Nvidia 960 with 16GB RAM so no where near type of the line.   Framerates were low but once again this is in very early access and $5 invested.\n\nI will say that the game pulled me in after I got the ropes.  Still not really sure what I am doing past the kiting of mobs, but fun none the less.  I recommend the game, even at this stage, $5 already better than many $50 games I have tried.  I haven't checked to see if there is any crafting yet.  I didn't see any indication that if there is going to be that it is implemented yet.  Crafting isn't really my cup of tea.  None the less crafting aside, I will say that I enjoyed this more than I did with Wurm Online (stand-alone) which I ended up getting a refund on and paid a good deal more money for.\n\nI am not a great reviewer.  Often I just ramble.  But let me close with saying that $5 is worth a chance on this game, even if you let it sit in your library for a few months.   I have a feeling that it is going to shape up to be a nice little niche MMO/LAN RPG.","May 22","true","1.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I have played for a couple days now and I really enjoy the open feel to the game. More features and bug fixes are being constantly released. The game is $4.99. Give it a try and see for yourself.

This game has potential, it is rough don't get me rough it is early access after all. This is what earley access is meant for let me say a few things. This is a mmo that encourages private servers, that could be huge for communities, and for only 5$ would make a great game to a community.\n\nIn my eyes this could be a great game for a RP community with the full pvp, private server option. But it is a long way from that, first off the moment is horrific(as seen in viedo below) you click "W" and after a not instant response your character will move, then continue to move 2-3 more steps it is awful. There is zero emotes in this game and that's unacceptable for a mmo today(easily fixable tho). Combat was pretty standard for a mmo the graphics arn't horrible(although the starting robes are flat untextured black(once again fixable)\n\nOne neat thing I did see was when I started I had two skills bound to Q & E which is fine then I got a new skill of my choice(Heal) from a fairly wide selection and it asked what do I want it bound to, so i picked 1. Still neat that I could make my own truly custom layout to my needs.\n\nSo right out of the game the game is playable but nothing terribly new. I would recommend buying this if you would like to help a indie studio gown and help shape the future of a game. (Given the studio is community driven)\n\nHere is a better look:\nhttps://youtu.be/-WIUzc2OdnI","April 30","true","0.4"," 13 of 24 people (54%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","54","13","24","2","1"
