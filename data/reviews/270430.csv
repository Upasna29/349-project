It's also an insightful look into the development process.\n\nCypress Inheritance: The Beginning is a first person exploration game brought to you by the confusingly named Cypress Inheritance, which involves elements of stealth and an open world, or at least it would be if it actually worked.\n\nMy full review is the video review above. Don't waste your money.\n\nUPDATE 12/03/14: The developer has in fact updated the game with some graphics options, as well as "a few changes with the A I". Patch notes can be found in the usual place, although I can't comment on these changes at the current time, as I reviewed the game on release when it should have been complete, and I simply can't re-review games whenever they are patched due to the amount of other titles coming out.","March 9, 2014","false","4.3"," 715 of 854 people (84%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","84","715","854","3","84"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Meroka/recommended/270430/","Meroka","[BM] Meroka","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Meroka/","897 products in account","Cypress Inheritance promises an interesting experience, but is sadly marred by the worst optimisation in a game I've ever encountered. The game is hardly on the bleeding edge of graphical fidelity, looking like a title from over 5 years ago, yet demands absurdly high computer specifications to show off this low-res mess. If you have a very high end gaming machine you could consider this title, though it would scarcely do your investment any justice. Anyone else would do well to stay away until the developers can be bothered to optimise. Buyer beware.\n\nCheck out my first impressions (such as they are) here: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=239820264","March 18, 2014","false","0.9"," 125 of 152 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","125","152","0","0"

The game looks like it came out in 2005, but manages to run poorly even on a high-end system like mine. 15fps is simply unacceptable, especially for a game with such low-res textures. I simply gave up on the game about ten minutes into it due to the issues it had running on my system. There was an update for the game with some extra graphics settings, but they did nothing to help the performance.\n\nI’d advise staying away from this game.","April 27, 2014","false","0.3"," 79 of 98 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","79","98","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/theetherealknight/recommended/270430/","theetherealknight","Whisp","http://steamcommunity.com/id/theetherealknight/","334 products in account","I've played quite a few broken games before, but this is pretty high on that list. There are so many problems in just the first half-hour of this game, that I doubt I will even try to brute-force my way through the sludge. First, they seem to have ignored optimization completely. Frequent and long loading screens, poor frame-rate, choppy camera control. Secondly, there is really no stealth. Enemies can spot you regardless of your position, visibility or speed of movement; most of the time, seemingly at random. Other times they will completely ignore you. The stealth utilities they give you are difficult to use when harried and when the frames are dropping (you know, the moment you need them). I found that the medkits were totally useless as well. Most of the time you can only take a single hit, and when you got lucky, two. There was never a point where I could stop and heal that graze.\n\nThe fact that they are trying to work on a Chapter 2 before dealing with all this seems to be a marketing ploy. The developers need to stop what they are doing and work on the game engine + A.I. before they waste their efforts on this shell of a game. I sincerely hope they do; I still think the premise is good. Will be hopeful for any large patches to come.","May 28, 2014","false","0.6"," 36 of 41 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","36","41","0","0"

It isn't just that I don't recommend it, I actively recommend against it.","June 17, 2014","false","0.4"," 19 of 26 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","19","26","2","0"

It is boring, pedantic and predictable with poor graphics, controls that can't be reconfigured, almost no gameplay instructions that make sense...I could go on.  Combine that with the inability to jump or manuver past up/down/right/left, and you have a huge yawner.  On top of that, for some reason if you don't skip the beginning part of the game...the story, there is a better than fifty fifty chance you will see the island blown up and get the credits rolling through the screen. Credits mind you, you must CNTRL, ALT, DEL to skip as ESC won't get you out.  Got to get those accolades in folks.  I know this is a rather harsh critique and I don't usually post them but with all the hype about this game, you would have thought it was something special, something worth paying for.  It wasn't until I bought and paid for it...money I can't get back for this piece of cr*p, that I found out just how bad it really is.  The reason for the criticism is to hopefully keep someone else from making the same mistake.  Buy Styx with your money, buy Thief, Dishonored if you want stealth, heck, buy Dark Messiah of Might and Magic...a fairly challenging D and D for a challenge with about the same level of graphics but some interesting gameplay, but please, don't invest your hard earned dollars in Cypress Inheritance.  This beginning should also be it's end.","January 1","false","12.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
