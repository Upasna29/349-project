And after a "few" hours of playing it, I don't have to think twice before recommending it to any fan of the genre, and even to those that aren't so familiar with it.\n\nComputers themselves, and software yet to be developed, will revolutionize the way we learn.\n\n\nSteve Jobs\n\nWithout any further delay, I present to you my review of Software Inc..\n\nGameplayLet he who has never thought about developing some sort of software throw the first byte and I shall compute it.\nSoftware Inc. is a game that allows you, the player, to develop your own software, while competing against AI companies that can easily go bankrupt, or simply bought out (I'm looking at you Microsoft!). From choosing your company's name, to the year you wish you start, you'll have a wide range of options to customise your character, and surely even more in the future. You won't be able to start a gigantic company from the get-go, so you'll have to work hard and complete some side contracts while developing your company's first software. And after developing that first piece, you'll just find out that the critics tagged it as crapware.\nOnce you get the hang of it, you'll find out it's incredibly fun to develop your IPs, whether you choose to develop an AntiVirus IP, a Games IP, or even an Operating System IP, and just when you're about to release that latest piece of technology, your thoughts will be: "Ok, just one more and I'll go to bed." Trust me, it won't be just one more.\nSure, the game isn't perfect. Even simple changes could make the game more enjoyable. But that's why it's Early Access, and that's why the developers are so active around the forums. Software Inc. is a true gem.\n\nPros Extremely active development team, not only around the forums, but also providing some hotfixes;\nDelightful graphics that despite not being a vital part for the genre, is always a plus;\nPlenty of tutorials, pretty much one for each function, and they're all truly insightful;\nMany options and improvements for each type of software;\nMinimalist UI, containing everything the player will need;\nA good amount of customization available to create the player's character, from colors to skills;\nEnjoyable environment and sound effects.\nConsidering it's an Early Access (EA) game, I've decided to add a "Neutral" category, for details I consider important, but not gamebreakers, and could easily improve the gameplay if attended.\n\nNeutral Despite being pretty good, the 'Build Mode' needs some improvement, especially to allow the player to build L and T shaped corridors, as well as to have a "bulk" buy option, or even a copy/paste, since it can be pretty boring after a while to do the plan/buy the same things over and over again;\nIt feels like the staff loses too much time eating/drinking/going to the bathroom during the day, even if all those things are two steps away;\nCould use some more objects, but I'm sure these will be added in the future;\nCouple minor bugs, not gamebreaking, but could improve the game's quality if fixed.\nConsidering most of the "Cons" I had in mind were already mentioned by the developers as something they're planning to fix, this list will be somewhat short, and I'm sure it will be even shorter after a while. I will, however, still list some that I feel are in bad shape, despite being mentioned by the developers.\n\nCons In dire need of some balancing overall, mostly around the profits, stocks market and reputation;\nStaff are not only extremely demanding, but also incredibly well paid;\nNeeds a new/better notification system to alert the player of new technology and/or rival's releases.\nVerdictI'd give it a 8/10, which could easily increase to a 9, and even a 10, with further updates and some more balancing. I've no doubt that, if attended to, it will be one of the best, if not the best, of the genre.","May 5, 2015","true","21.3"," 75 of 85 people (88%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","88","75","85","5","9"

Probably not, but that doesn't mean that you shouldn't do that.\n\nSoftware Inc. is a game in which you can start with next-to-no money and work your butt off to make the biggest and best pieces of software on the market - including Operating Systems, Game Engines, Games, and more. You start out with a solo developer (who you can customise and name, likely after yourself) and who's stats you can adjust to make them better at things like programming, design, art, marketing, etc...\n\nOnce you've built your first office using a system that's simultaneously more simple and more complex than building in The Sims, you're good to get working. Fast forward a few successful releases and you're likely going to be looking at hiring and managing different teams of staff, each of which you can have specialised in one aspect of software development. Personally, I enjoy splitting one team in to three teams, each part specialising in the three aspects of software production - Design, Programming, and Art.\n\nAs your bank balance grows, your company grows, the land you own grows, and your buildings will grow. You can start with a room, and eventually own and fill the space equivalent to several city blocks, all because of your successful software company - and this really is just scratching the surface of the game. You also manage company insurance, you can buy and sell stocks, you can sabotage other (computer controlled) companies, buy out companies, buy and sell intellectual property, and much more.\n\nAnd this is all just in Alpha 7.\n\nIf that doesn't convince you, these 67 videos might.","February 3","true","142.0"," 50 of 50 people (100%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","100","50","50","9","0"

Don't talk much on forums, don't review and I have never really tried to actively provide input and suggestions to the developers when it comes to early access games. This game changed all of that for me.\n\nFirst thought on your mind is most likely; "But it is another Early Access game and too many past ones have burned to the ground". You're right, by this point so many people have been ripped off over silly development stalls and a lack of promised content. You have a right to be and if that is a position that you can't be budged from read my review and just wait, keep an eye on the game's development, watch videos, and ask players the questions you want to know about it. The developer, username: Coredumping on steam, is extremely active and responsive on the forum which is where I will start my review I suppose.\n\nI haven't ultimately owned the game long but in about two and a half weeks (maybe less) I have put in over 50 hours XD this game is so addicting. With that said I have already talked with the developer on the forums on multiple occasions addressing bugs I had stumbled into and some small imediate suggestions I had. All of these conversations were wonderful, I felt "heard" (would it be feeling read in text forums? o.O) and I also felt like he seriously cared about what I had to say. He is very open with his project, almost all his current goals and development directions are listed on trello (https://trello.com/b/9I286Mhu/software-inc). This kind of transparency is nice as a player and supporter of his game and another reason for you to support it if this game interests you enough.\n\nNow the game.\nLike I said earlier this game is addicting or as my friend said, "This game is f*cking coke!" Be warned though, there is definitely a learning curve to running a successful long term game. I personally like this as it makes the game more rewarding to play but others may not. There is also a decent amount of content for early development, especially compared to other early access games. I would suggest watching a video for most the basic mechanics and game options but I will give you a rough overview. You get a personal character who starts a business. Hire employees, manage their salaries, educated them, and try to make the best selling software. You get to completely build and customize your Office (obviously within the limits of how he codes the construction mechanics). The building mechanics are a bit clunky and can be a trouble at times but there is a way to work around most of it's limitations with some experience at it. I am sure he will improve it as time goes but one thing for example is a second story (no matter how wide the dimensions of it's lower floor) can only have enough "structural support" to hang over one square messurement. Progress in the game feels pretty nice so far. One "day" is a month on the game calender and he has already stated he will have a time bar option to make one "day" be a week on the game calender with four weeks to a month. The game starts in 1980 unless you choose otherwise and as years pass new software and tools become available. Characters and Softwares have various details, traits and skills (characters only). The game is a bit limited on a variety of furniture/tools but stuff like that should be towards the end of alpha developement. I personally have also not come across any game-breaking bugs.\n\nModding: I am personally not a modder but this game as inspired me to learn a tiny bit to make some mods for this game when it drops. Right now modding is very limited to changing the values of certain mechanics and adding new companies, senarios and software. The future of modding for his game seems very appealing, he plans to have modding accessible in-game and very user-friendly. This is a huge plus in my mind as a supporter of the game because it shows that the developer understands that not only is the content he adds important but player driven content is also extremely important and he has a plan for that already.\n\nIf this review has interested you in the game even the slightest more I highly recommend watching a few videos and asking some questions on the forum. For 12 dollars this game is already very impressive and shows massive potential for a final product. Or just wait and watch it :) if I am not mistaken the game will be 12 dollars on release as well.","May 9, 2015","true","89.4"," 41 of 43 people (95%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","95","41","43","5","0"

I missed the release last year and accidentally found the game while searching for games under the management tag, and what a nice surprise it was! This is hands down the best software development game I've played, and there are quite a few in the market now (Game Dev Tycoon, GamersGoMakers, Mad Games Tycoon etc.)\n\nWhat sets it apart for me is the soft simple graphics and the smooth interface. It is very easy to learn the controls and build big impressive looking office complexes. It also allows you to customize the pace, difficulty and starting locations for varied experiences. In the simulation/management genre, this game is right up there with the best of them.\n\nYou start with youself as the founder of the company building a simple little office and starting to work on a few small contracts. From there you start developing your own software: Antivirus, games, operating systems, audio and visual design software, and more. As you grow, you can expand your office and workforce. It's entirely up to you how much you'd like to micromanage. You can assign team leaders and send them on HR and project management courses allowing them to hire and manage teams and their own projects completely independently. The game scales incredibly well as you expand your company.\n\nSome might find the spreadsheets a little overwhelming. I actually like it because it makes my little virtual company feel real. This game was really well thought out and you have all the data you might need at your disposal.\n\nNegatives? Not much. It is early access so there are some glitches, and the game could do with more content. Most notably furniture is currently a bit limited, but that said all the necessary stuff is already there for you to have heaps of fun. There's also some minor balancing issues that will be sorted out later but again nothing gamebreaking and nothing that will ruin your fun. So far the developer of Software Inc. has built a great foundation for what will probably become one of the most unique and fun management simulations on the market.","March 18","true","31.5"," 33 of 33 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","33","33","0","0"

Game has huge potential already, and the dev is extremely responsive to bug-reports and feature suggestions.\n\nYou can:\n- Take software contracts for quick cash but with steep penalties for failure.\n- Run your business into the ground and lose the game.\n- Take out loans to stay afloat.\n- Start your own software projects, choose from a number of different types (games, game engines, OS, tools, anti-virus, etc), choose the OS(s) to build it for, choose the tools you use to make it.\n- Release your product in an unfinished, broken state, but hype it to hell and make a bunch of money anyways.\n- Market your software to increase awareness and marketshare\n- Interview employees at a cost, choose one with the skills you need and a personality that plays\nwell with your other employees.\n- Educate your employees on the various skills (there are a ton) and make them better.\n- Negotiate wages and lowball your best employees, it's so realistic!\n- Make it Open Source if you hate money (or want to handicap your competitors)\n- Make it In-House to keep it all to yourself\n- Build an office and keep it clean and working. Make sure it's quiet, clean and comfortable to keep coders happy.\n- Buy servers to run your network based programs, and keep your Source Control repos on to keep your projects safe.\n- Trade in the stock market\n- Curse when your employees call in sick on the last day before the work is due.\n- Choose your distribution channel, or start your own if you've got the infrastructure. Charge money for mods and start a firestorm. (not really, that's crazy)\n- Tons more\n\nThere are a couple negatives atm, like blah graphics and animations, a couple bugs and weird behaviors, not very many options for purchasing furniture or decoration right now, and game pace that's just slightly out of whack. But the dev is hard at work and is constantly listening to the player-base on things that need to change or improve, and I really expect that most of these issues will be resolved before long.

Then I grew up and realized how gosh darn hard that really can be. Software Inc totally takes out the middleman and lets you live out your gaming fantasies, in extreme micro management detail and complexity. Rise from a lowly developer all the way to a mega mogul, who has no soul. As you buy out your enemies and release "Skylight 98" a new OS that will earn you so much cash you literally won't know what to do with it. Software Inc comes with quite a steep learning curve, from stocks, retail, development, HR, insurance, you will manage every facet of a business in the gaming/technology industry. What makes Software Inc beautiful is it also allows you a great amount of freedom how you go about it. You can construct your own headquarters, choose your employes and design your own CEO. Once you master the systems in place, Software Inc truly shines and suddenly 40 hours of your life are gone. The only negative thing I can think of to say about Software Inc is that the game still needs quite a bit of personality injected into it. There isn't any music and most of time your staring at menus, this isn't really anything major given the nature of tycoon games and the fact this title is still in Early Access/Alpha. So if you're looking for a business management game with a focus on taking over the world of gaming.

The developer is also active on the forums[www.swinc.net], both Steam and his own.\n\nWhile in the game, you can:\nBuild a huge company on a huge chunk of property (256x256 grid!)\nManage multiple teams at once. (One could be dedicated to Marketing, or you could just automate the whole process!)\nBuy/sell stocks to gain money and rights. (WARNING: There are plans to overhaul the whole system)\nBuyout your competition and laugh while you gain their profits\nDevelop over 5 kinds of software (There are plans to add more)\nLink up multiple servers and run your own distribution network or host your source code\nHire/fire staff and employees to help maintain your company\nGo bankrupt and have to sell out 75% of your company's stocks for profit.\nEducate team members to increase their effectiveness and make more profits\nAnd last but not least, this game had mod support! While the community is relatively small, there is enough mod documentation on the wiki to make your own if needed!\nIn short, get this game NOW because he has plans to increase the cost near release. It is in a playable state as is, and you can easily get around the bugs. In my opinion, this game has a lot of potential and is well-worth the money as is.\n","June 1, 2015","true","50.6"," 21 of 21 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","21","21","0","0"

This game, however, takes the simulation factor up a notch. I have nearly called into my real job, just to stay home to oversee the design phase of my pretend OS.\n\nIf you want to talk addictive gameplay, this game has it. I'm constantly manipulating the time compression, so I can skip the boring programming more or less, and slow it way down or even pause it to contemplate what product my team should design next, or how much to deposit in the employee insurance fund (super important to do btw), or hire some new hotshot programmer. Should I re-tile the bathroom floor? I think so. Should I put the server farm in the basement? Yeah, why not? Should I fire Susan, because she hates the company founder and can't even effectively market a simple audio tool? Most definitely.\n\nThis seems like it would just simulate the bad parts of working in a cubicle farm, but I cannot stop refining my strategy when I'm not actually playing. I'd whole heartedly recommend this game. Look at the negative reviews, and you see a bunch of people who played for 15 minutes, couldn't figure it out, and trashed the game play. This game deserves a higher level of player. Perhaps that is you.","January 5","true","41.4"," 22 of 23 people (96%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","96","22","23","4","0"

I've wanted a game like that for so long! I was bored of "Game dev story" and "Game studio tycoon" where you could not design your buildings and really build your company. This time, the tycoon-ish side is very present, with the creativity side! What a good mix! I love this game for everything it brings. You may want to have dedicated graphica for this game though. Audio is still to improve but graphics are stable and well done. I like the fact that you can choose from lots of different settings for graphics. It really surprises me that when I tryed playing this game with my laptop, I had to town down the graphica down a bit. I would say: A decent CPU, minimum 2 cores, dedicated graphics (Playable with 512M but still great with a 256M (Don't expect amazing graphics from your old computer). I would recommend 1GB of video memory for best FPS. With my iMac, I can hardly get 30FPS with high graphics, but it's still very playable. For the audio, you won't get amazing soundtracks (guys, it's still in alpha!!) but I see lots of improvement coming.\nMy final quote: 4 stars.\nI would have payed easily 10$ more for this game. I would also see this version as a release. It is very stable and smooth.\n\nFor the developpers (What I'd like to see:)\n-Background music as it will bring a better playing experience,\n-More simple UI, when I started playing, I could not find all the things easily, but still good,\n-Did I said background music?\n-Interactive tutorial to give new players a good start,\n\nI would say, buy this game.

Growing up to be such an addictive game, but it still has some learning to do before it can be well-known and loved. It offers some quite different gameplay from GDT, Sims, and Prison Architect, allowing you to take the seat of a founder of a software company similar to Microsoft, Sony, and other companies out there. You are able to build a company from a simple plot of land to a Major Gaming industry giant or a popular company known for making a Anti-virus programs, Game engines, and even Art software similar to Gimp. The choice is up to you what your company is known for, how your base of operations is built (and colored), and how to manage your employees through their needs and wants. Though this Game may be young and needs time to be develop, still it seems impressive for what it offers so far. There are some tiny bugs wondering around the game, they are barely noticeable.\n\nI have posted a video on Youtube that gives you an view of the game (listed below) and I plan on making a Let's play series on it. (*Warning*: I may be Loud and Unprofessional when talking, but will not say any Bad words or mean things)\nhttps://youtu.be/xeU1PUNVRpI\n\nAlso I recommend playing the Demo (shown in video) as well if you want to experience some of the gameplay yourself, but there will some bugs that may occur during it.","May 1, 2015","true","24.0"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","20","24","3","1"

I think the game just needs more polish since many of the interfaces are extremely clunky. I despise those silly radial menues that are so hard to control. They remind me too much of Castle Story.\n\nI also think there is serious feature creep. If I was making this game in the game, it would be a medium scope game with recommended 5 developers being written by a single dev. Stuff like distribution and project/hr management are really good ideas but the amount of code required to make them functional/useful/interesting would far exceed the scope of this game.\n\nHere's some more of my opinions/advice for the developer\n\n-I don't think a UML minigame is medium priority, more low priority.\n-Need way better server management system, I mean come on you can't be seriously asking me to manually place 200 servers\n-Need better furniture management system, I mean come on you can't be seriously asking me to manually move 200 servers\n-IT requirements are too low. I have a ton of servers all managed by one IT guy who works only 4 hours a day.\n-AI companies are really weak, by year 4 I was worth double any other company in the game\n-There's an opportunity to develop a really cool financial system - play Railroad Tycoon II to get a feel of what I'm talking about. The current system is a bit lacking.\n-I don't think loans scale up. The max I could ever borrow is 100K.\n-Salary management is a massive hassle. I find myself just hitting accept & close every time because manually going through 50 employees is not worth the 5K/month.\n\nThere's a lot of other stuff but the main point is that the game is already pretty fun, don't ruin it with features you can't implement right that will crash/bug out the game.\n\nCongrats on going full time, I envy you.","November 30, 2015","true","7.0"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","94","16","17","4","0"

Graphics are plain, but I don't normally care about graphics in the first place so it doesn't bother me. It is quite funny to see the animation of your employees, it is like they are just hitting their keyboard very hard.\n\nThe game is unique for its type. It is a lot better than Dev Tycoon or other related games by far. There's more to do and you aren't limited on what you can do. Expand, hire employees, manage, make servers, connect servers, make Software for your company and many more features. There's a ton of management in this game too, which is great.\n\nTutorials are buggy and a few systems could use some touching up. It has its bugs, but what Early Access game doesn't?\n\nThe main problem I came across was, is the game is too easy. Given 1 hour of my played time was reading through the tutorials and learning how the game works. However, once you get your skills up (Marketing mainly: which doesn't take long) for your employees, money is too easy to receive. Of course that means you can expand further and try to dominate your competitors. I created an OS with just two employees (recommended was 7 team members) and I received over $950,000 in revenue, after that I still gained over hundreds of thousands every month until it finally stopped. I now have over 2 million dollars.\n\nI'm just pointing out that this game should be more challenging or at least more time consuming to get up to that amount of money.\n\nThe other portion of the game I don't enjoy is you constantly have to keep fast-forwarding (don't have to but normal speed is super slow if you don't). Perhaps if the game values and progress worked at a different speed you wouldn't need to fast-forward so much.\n\nIn due time this game will get better and I can't wait to see the finish product. I'll still play regardless to dominate my competition as the most successful company in the game. I still recommend this game regardless of what I wrote, especially at the price it is at because there is a lot of features in this game, currently. I'll update my review when improvements to the game occur.","May 13, 2015","true","3.1"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","16","18","2","0"

The game is still early access but is still being developed fairly fast by a one man band and he has a full time job to boot. If you are looking for polished graphics and audio, then this game is not for you (so far).\nIt's a simulation of you being a software developer/guru. You run your company on one of 3 difficulties. There is mod support too.\nGameplay can be found on Youtube but some of the videos are of some pretty early versions of the game.\nWhat's in the game so far: pathfinding is really good but there is some improvement that is being made, ability to hire, train   (through education or leadership skills) and fire (but there is a penalty for this) workers, bonus items for your workers including managers( called lead in this game), better chairs, room decoration, food and coffee, toilets, windows, lights, heating and air conditioning, servers for control management as well as for web store and online game servers,  software contracts and other jobs(deals) through a receptionist feature, multi-story building (up to 10 stories) and a basement. Recent addition is polygon rooms. There is also an automation feature too!\nYou get to control the quality of the software you produce at the expense of more time developing and programming. There is also reputation in the game which can influence how your customers perceive you. There is a stock market.\nWhen creating software you can choose to sell to the market, give it away (open source) or use it in-house (this may change shortly so you can use in-house then sell in the marketplace).\n\nWeaknesses: As stated above, graphics and audio leave a lot to be desired but in my opinion are fine as they are. The financial system could be better. I am not a fan of the stock market nor of the financial reporting system for expenses. I did not note above but there is insurance for your employees too!\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this game if you like building and management games. Oh, did I mention Mods?

It has taken me this long to get my head around the core gameplay as there is a bit of a learning curve but nothing that should prevent you from playing at its full potential.\nThe gameplay and mechanics have a great amount of depth and work well together and the game is super stable. The ability to build a software company from the ground up is the key nature of this game. You'll build your first office to get started and before long you are running multi stories and building server farms, then there's the employees that are another key aspect. there's not a great deal of objects in yet but what is there is functional and customizable to your chosen color palette(s). Building is pleasurable and the ability to build what you want is huge which brings me to the map size, I would say you will have a hard time filling it especially considering you can go up 10 levels and down 1, the map is massive which gives you free reign to do as you please. I'm hoping to see updated graphics and new objects and styles for customization in future builds.\nNow to the core gameplay which is developing software, marketing it and supporting it. There are a number of options for you to choose, maybe an Operating System? (this can take a long time to make) or perhaps a visual program that's linked to a few different OS's? There are different features within your software as well that you can choose to add or not. Put your best design team into action and get that puppy to the development stage, the more time you put in the better the quality, smash the bugs or do half and have your support division take on squashing them as they come up after you've released. Now market the hell out of it until it's not worth it anymore and watch the dollars roll in. Maybe take on some contracts early game to get some funds to kick off that killer program that will launch you into the business world. Once you get your head around multiple teams you could plop down a reception and get paid to develop, design, support or market other companies software. Don't forget to get that server room up and running to help support your online distribution store or for compiling your new code and tackling bugs easier. Maybe you could develop an online OS that requires a server that's running 24/7?\nThe options in this game are amazing and I haven't seen depth like this in a tycoon game for a number of years, if your on the fence then check out some game play videos on Youtube and check it out. I would say just go ahead and grab it, the price is actually much less than this game is worth for sure.\nOh did I metion the mods that are available and easy to install? Well they add new software development options such as Mobile OS, Web Browsers, Forums, VOIP servers. The list is long and once you get your head around the game I would recommend starting a new game on hard with mods and see how you go.\n\nThis game is still in development and can only become exceptional, the tycoon aspects of building a software business are massive with great management aspects all so.\n\nRating 8/10 (leaving room for the extra stuff that is still being added)","December 20, 2015","true","78.4"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

It's not. I think this is one of the best early Access Games on Steam atm, next to KSP (not anymore EA) and Prison Architect. HIGHLY!! recommended! (If you like tycoon games)\nPros:\n-Awesome combo between Building and managing ressources\n-Cute Graphics\n-Insanely In-Depth\n-Building works really well\n-Drag n' Drop mods (Although not many exist yet)\n-You can grow BIG\n-Many more things I'm not listing here\nCons:\n-UI isn't that accesible and eg. checking individual Employees is quite annoying,first you have to select them with left click, whick is already quite hard when playing from far out, right click to bring up a menu and then select "Employee Details". Luckily this game is Early Access, so I hope this will be redone or altered :3.\n-That's pretty much all the cons, exept that there are no real tutorials on how to mod this game properly. There is a "Test Mod" in existance, but I myself didn't find that very helpful.\nAnyway, I can only repeat myself, if you like these kind of games, BUY DAT.

Updates are a very regular occurance (once maybe even twice a week currently).

Takes inspiration from games like the Sims and Game Dev Tycoon, but is a different game than either of those separately. Whereas Game Dev Tycoon is very limiting in what you can customize and do to expand your workspaces and capabilities, Software Inc. provides a ton of flexibility. You can build your own offices, provide additional facilities for employees in terms of food, coffee, and bathrooms. Also, you can create different teams and multiple teams of the same skillsets in order to tackle multiple project simultaneously. Managing all of these teams later in the game can prove to be welcome challenge as you assign different stages of software development to different specialized teams.\n\nAlso, don't let the fact that this game is early access disuade you from checking it out, there are a ton of features already included in this game and it is overall very solid in terms of stability. There are bugs, but there are less than I would have expected from a one man crew putting out a game like this into early access.","May 9, 2015","true","21.7"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","11","12","3","0"

I had a company worth more than 50 million. I had aggressively bought out all my old competitors in the Operating System field, and was marketing a 4 year old OS and making millions off of it. I had more than 30 emloyees..of course not all of them got along with each other, but then again, I wasn't very picky in terms of effectiveness. By the year 2010, I was seen as the GOD of ALL software and those who dared come out with Operating Systems would have their company bought out by me (I didn't even spare the start-up companies..so evil.)...I had monopolized the OS field and was basically the "Kingpin of OS." I was the infamous Lex Luthor of the ambigious city my company was established in. I bought out most of the city..if the cops didn't bow down before me..they'd be swimming with the fish.\n\n"Seeing as though I’m only one person right now, development might move a little slow, but I’m an effective programmer and I have been able to get Software Inc. to a playable and almost feature-complete state within 6 months without any help, while taking courses and working a job"\n\nCreator of this game is awesome!!","August 21, 2015","true","61.7"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","11","12","0","0"

Ignoring the whole Software part of the game, the building component is spectacular. I'm not much of a builder, but I really had fun with the flexibility offered. Really looking forward to what the next releases and future modding community will bring.\n\nThe software aspect of things is pretty neat, if not immediately intuitive. After playing awhile you'll find out which features guarantee success for software. Timing is important; releasing cutting edge software before a competitor will make you millions, but if you're beaten to market you'll lose big. The strategy component is definitely there and if all you want is to make software with a team of people, you can do that.\n\nA few weak spots exist, but the game as a whole is a great experience and better than most Early Access titles out there. The developer recently began working on Software Inc full time, so I have great expectations for future releases.","December 27, 2015","true","152.4"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","3"

A Commodore 64 and an Amiga 500. Games genres didn't seem to have boundaries and game developers came up with cool ideas and concepts. You could walk into independent stores and see shelves of games you had never heard of, take a punt with your weekly pocket money and usually find an gem.\n\nThen games companies found a "formula", make an FPS or RTS and it's a money spinner. People "designing" games stopped being gamers and devs and started being business men and bean counters. Things got grim...until...indie devs making their ideas into games in their home offices (and normally trying to hold down a proper job at the same time). We got back to the golden years of spending a pocket money amount and finding a gem of a game that is just different.\n\nThis game is a "golden years gem". It's different, it's not following the formula. OK there are a few indie games you could say the same of but this game just feels, well, different!\n\nHow? Well to start with it's the detail. I'm a software developer in real life, we follow the Agile development process and before that we just did everything sit of pants style. This game allows you to create your software company following (loosely) the same methods. Start off as a 1 man team doing everything very seat of pants. Hire staff, grow, expand your business and offices. As you get bigger then start creating teams of devs and designers to either work on core software or more ad-hoc titles.\n\nYou can choose to be a business software company, games, art packages or do a bit of both. And here is the gotcha, you actually start to "care" about your business and staff, the game draws you in that deeply.\n\nAt the point it's still in early access but I've had no issues with crashes or anything major. There are some points that need polish:\n\n-Needs more options on furniture and equipment. 10 years before a computer terminal is upgraded is a long time and we all know tech moves a lot quicker!\n\n-Non-squre rooms are sometimes difficult to recreate with a 2nd floor (walls don't seem to want to snap to endpoint)\n\n-Networks: I'd like to create networks between servers and desktop machines so I can have control over who have access to what\n\n-Accounts Dept: What about adding an accounts team to pay bills, chase detbers etc?\n\nThere is a modding ability so I'm sure the furniture issue will get filled quickly by the community though.\n\nOn the whole however this is a great game. I can certainly recommend it to anyone who is working in the IT community and even if you're not apart of the IT Crowd you'll still enjoy the game plus get some insight into how these companies work.\n\nDefinately worth my pcoket money!","May 8","true","26.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

After creating your first business, and having sunk many hours into it, only to have it fail is really upsetting - at least for me. You feel as if you don't want to go through the whole thing again and that you wasted some of your time.\n\nWhen you do create a company and have it ultimatly 'win,' you have no urge to do it again.\n\nThe only replayability aspect of this game is when you lose and want to win. It was somewhat fun learning how to play the game, I will admit.\n--\nIn terms of gameplay it isn't bad. Ultimatly it is just clicking a few buttons and then clicking on the fast forward button so they finish their project faster which does get old. The gameplay is the most fun more late game where you deal with stocks and ultimatly buy out people. Coming out on top does have a pretty good feeling.\n\nThe most fun I did have in this game was in fact creating my building and designing all of the rooms.\n--\nGraphics? Truth be told I like the style. It suits the type of game this is.\n--\nWhy I gave it a 7/10? There is low replayability, the gameplay can be a bit dull and you often find yourself browsing on your phone while time is sped up. Honestly, after you win you have no urge to do it all again.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that this is in early access - Everything isn't implied yet.\n\nIt is really awesome how there is a feature to drag and drop mods, so that's cool.\n\nDo I recommend it? Yes. It is fun. It is what you expect it to be. I will definatly come back and check it out in the future.","August 24, 2015","true","7.3"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","2"

After playing for an hour, I love the idea of the game so far! I always loved simulation games and  I feel that this game would be great after getting out of early access. I still enjoyed playing the game at this state so far and I wonder how much I would enjoy in the future!\n\nSince this is just an Early Access there are some features that I least like:\n\nThe interface in-game - I just don't know\n\nIn the first day, there will be no workers, therefore, the accepting contract jobs will make you miss the deadline, will have to skip to the next day and accept the job.\n\nDay system is very short, makes me feel old very fast\n\n\nHowever this is ONLY an Early Access, many features are incomplete, like the character creation.

Finally a game that could compete with another one of my favorites, Game Dev Tycoon. This game resembles Game Dev Tycoon but takes everything a step further basically.\n\nSo what is Software Inc. about? In this game you start and run your own software company where you will need to manage a budget, your team and make decisions on what to create and how to market it among other things. You can also build your own office and buy more land. Different teams can be assigned to different rooms and work on different projects while another team does something else. You can also hire maintenance crews to come clean, do maintenace or provide IT support for your released products.\n\nIn this game you can create games as we have seen in other similar games but here you can also make operating systems, visual tools, audio tools and game engines which can all be used to make other software. You can also chose to keep your software in-house, release and sell it or open source it and give it away for free.\n\nOh and did I say you can have multiple floors for your office? and you can build parking lots? There is so much you can do in this game that I won’t be able to fit all the good parts in this review.\n\nSo what are the negatives? Well the graphics could be improved but I rather have good gameplay than graphics and I did not feel that it took away from the fun of the game. There were also some small bugs where I couldn’t rotate a set of objects when moving them but these are to be expected in an early access game.\n\nIn future updates I would love to see more items, better stock value (it should be more advanced than just following the cash in the company), and possibly multiplayer if it can be done in a nice way.\n\nI would recommend buying this game, it is already great fun and the developer seems active with regular updates. I hope that this will continue but as you know with any early access game, you never know what the final outcome will be like.","June 21, 2015","true","5.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The game is good enough for alpha for it to be worth the price. I can see myself spending hour upon hour in this game building the perfect game studio.

And even going to expos putting your best item on a stale!\n\nOne minus is that the tutorials are not that helpful and to start with I had to look to the steam forums to help me get started, but after that I was away and getting revenue in the millions haha\n\nOverall this game is good and has great potential to bring. I'm hoping this alpha will be ran how prison architect was with good alphas and great new container, but overall keep up with the work on this game it is an amazing game to just pass the time and is such a nice game to play to waste a few hours and just relax.\n\nI can't wait to see what comes out of this game and at this point update 7.2 I recommend anyone to buy it as even at its current state it is a great game!\n\n8/10 at the moment!","January 9","true","6.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

Is so far a well thought out game, about developing a wide range of software. Apart from having extensive gameplay, and difficulty which can be ramped to near impossibility; Software Inc. has some of the most in depth stock simulations... well not really, but the market is something to kepp your eye on.\nNow for a few little problems:\n- The OS market is slightly unrealistic, and without the ability to do what Microsoft is currently doing to upgrade people from previous versions to Windows 10, it is difficult to gain a monoply - as it should be, but my company in the game is the sole producer of OS's now and i still cant get a monopoly\n- you are unable to produce other software - Browsers, Word Processors, Databases, etc. are all types of software i would love to make in the game,\n- Cleaner AI! - The cleaners in the game do not go for the most dirty area, they are seemingly random in their selection, this can lead to insane amounts of lag if the cleaners never clean up a single spot.\n- Lack luster game dev - the level of detail in game development is lack luster, although features can be added, you canoot chose what type of game you want, nor can you goto Game Dev Tycoon levels of game development.\n- Currently overpriced - the game is currently not worth the cash, however, with future updates it will of course be worth every penny.","January 3","true","40.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I play a lot of early access games. lately ive been averaging buying a game a day for the past few weeks or so. this is the only one i feel compelled to write a review for. the early access has been fun enough for me to want to spend 40 solid hours on it. I'll probably go in spurts of 10 or so hours though while it goes through updates. the tycoon gameplay is awesome. build animation tools and mobile connection stuff. youll be a billionaire pretty instantly. i only had 10 or so million dollars and in a couple days after building my first 3d animation tool i had 200 mil. 5 hours later and i have 4 bil.\n\npros -\n-really really fun gameplay. the management style of the game is great. you really need to pay attention to what your employees are good at and assign them to the right team/room\n-its fun to mod and have a very high number of possible creations\n-i really enjoy giving the teams some autonomy to create their own products\n-for all of the management and software aspects, the developer still made the building very deep and intricate. much appreciated.\n\ncons -\n-I may be doing this wrong, but i believe that you can assign multiple chairs to one employee. this gets annoying if you want to switch what room they work in and they have multiple chairs assigned to them. it gets really annoying when you have 75 employees.\n-I appreciate the minigames to help speed up the software process. i think the developer knows it is slow going early on for the player. but lets just say its pretty slow in the beginning. not that that is a bad thing, but im hoping for more softwares that are easy to make that might not be as easy to market to help the player build up that bank account in the beginning rather than having to type words in your design stage.\n\nin all, extremely solid game. i love it. i am looking forward to more updates and the final release.\n\ncurrent rating: 9.5/10 (any game this good in early access is worth buying, so buy it!)","May 5","true","12.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I plan to play it for a couple hours, then 14 hours later realize I'm late for work. It's like a rough diamond however, in that it still feels a touch bland and is rough around the edges, but I've been loving it. I'm going to review this game in an as-is state, rather than reviewing it based on what it can be.\n\nPros:\n-Very enjoyable game development sim (I find it more enjoyable than Game Dev Story or Game Dev Tycoon.)\n\n-Building system works amazing. It isn't quite like the Sims or something where you have hundreds of objects to place, but the developer has stated that furniture modding is coming as is more furniture overall.\n\n-Dev listens to feedback and is very active in the community.\n\n-Very large updates, all clear improvements upon the last. Larger than some of the big studios, and nowhere near as buggy as some other EA titles do their updates.\n\n-Modding support (Can mod new software, features, companies, people, etc,) that the dev has plans of making stronger (Looking forward to furniture modding.)\n\nMeh:\n-Updates are slow. The game is made by one man, and the updates are large and stable, so I wouldn't say this is too bad of a thing.\n\n-Performance can start to die rapidly if you go overboard growing your company. I can handle up to about 350 staff members without lag, but once I go over a certain threshold I drop to 5FPS in a heartbeat. Keep in mind that there is basically never going to be any need whatsoever for that much staff in the games current state, so this is hard to blame the dev for.\n\n-The graphics. I don't hate them, but I also don't love them. Doesn't detract from the gameplay too much however, and I can still make buildings that look nice.\n\nCons:\n-Very little endgame content. There's a point once you've automated teams to design all the software types and effectively own the entire market. The dev has intentions of working on this however, and so far I've been fine just starting a new save whenever the game gets stale. I did feel like this is something worth mentioning though, as some people hate starting new saves in games.\n\n-Not enough furniture variety, though this is another thing the dev is working on.\n\n-The difficulty curve is a little wonky. I found the game extremely difficult for my first 15 hours or so, but after that point I just sort of figured out exactly how the game works and game became extremely easy in a manner of a few hours. The dev has plans for working on this too.\n\n-I've had the occasional crash, but only WELL into long gaming sessions where most programs and games tend to crash anyways. Hard to fault the developer for this one as well.\n\n-Other than parking lots and roads, you can't do anything with the outdoors other than place more buildings. Outdoor furniture is coming in the next update however, so I will update this review once Alpha 8 is out.","February 21","true","79.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

You can be a single employee pounding away on their keyboard in a programmer mini hut, or build a sprawling software dev company complete with underground server room.\n\nYou are also given several different ways to bring in money. Develop your own OS, editing software, office software, different CRMs. Don't feel like doing that? Grab some contract work or research some patents for additional income.\n\nAre you a micro manager style player? I am. Assign employees to any team, role, train them however you want. Don't really feel like dealing with all of that? Train up your Leads to manage product development and hiring/firing for you.\n\nImho, this is already a complete game.

For myself i find the fine level of detail that is put into the developing of software appealing. As much as I can tell now the developer seems to be active both in supporting the people through the steam forums or by actually developing the game further.\n\nThe biggest advantages are micromanagement and the opportunity to develop more than games (Operating Systems or Antivirus Software Kits are just an example). Also the graphics might seem very simplistic - which they are - but for me it gives the game its own charm.\n\nNow for the critics. The difficulty jump between the settings from easy to hard is extremly high so you need to be actually quite into the game to survive there. Also the tutorial may explain everything but it takes quite a while to get through all of it. One should also notice that save games which break sometimes when a big patch arrives need to be planned it.\n\nFor all those who are not familiar with buying Early Access stuff: DO NOT BUY STUFF UNLESS YOU ARE SURE WHAT YOU BUY. The games are still developed so give the game a bit more freedom in the negative side. For me it helps to get along with a game principle. Even if you think you wasted money after the buy you can still use that to have some actual fun with the game.\n\nOkey last but not least the conclusion guys.\nI love this game from heart, simply because it allows people to actually be the guy developing the game - a big plus if you usually are the consumer in my opinion. I apologize for any grammar or spelling mistakes ( I always appreciate constructive criticism. )\n\nAnyways:\nBuy it if you love tycoon games with micromanagement that also involves the not so popular topic of game developing and not playing.\nLeave it if you get annoyed fast by having to restart quite a few times and being crazily focused about the graphics.

I accidentally found it while searching for tycoon games and what a surprise it was! This is the best software development game I've played compared with Game Dev Tycoon, GamersGoMakers, Mad Games Tycoon etc.\n\nWhat sets it apart is the simple graphics and the smooth interface. It is easy to learn the controls and build big impressive looking office complexes.\n\nYou start as the founder of the company starting to work on a few small contracts. From there you start developing your own software: Antivirus, games, operating systems, audio and visual design software, ect. As you grow, you can expand your office and workforce. It's entirely up to you how much you'd like to micromanage. You can assign team leaders and send them on HR and project management courses allowing them to hire and manage teams and their own projects completely independently. The game scales incredibly well as you expand your company.\n\nSome might find the micromanagement a little overwhelming. This game was really well thought out and you have all the data you might need at your disposal.\n\nIt is early access so there are some glitches, and the game could do with more content. Most notably furniture is currently a bit limited, but that said all the necessary stuff is already there. There's also some minor balancing issues that will be sorted out later but nothing gamebreaking and nothing that will ruin your fun. So far the developer of Software Inc. has built a great foundation for what will probably become one of the most unique and fun management simulations on the market.\n\nIn the simulation/management genre, this game is right up there with the best of them.\n\nTHE GOOD\n\n+ Great interface\n+ Level of micromanagement is optional\n+ Regular updates\n+ Workshop support\n\nTHE BAD\n\n- Still Early Access\n- Limited content\n- Ballance issues","May 30","true","24.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","6"

It's a real simulation where you can build and control everything. Its scope is huge as well. Not only can you develop your own games, but also other kind of software and operating systems, and reuse them for bigger projects.\n\nYou need to handle your employees' satisfaction, behavior, compatibility with each other, salary expectations and regular raises, skill training, and so on. You build and maintain every piece of your office, and you need to keep it functional, accounting for light, noise, cleanliness and temperature levels. As your office and employee pool grow, you create different teams that can work on multiple projects at the same time. You can even build a multi-story building!\n\nAll the aspects of software development seem to be present and well implemented, despite the early access state of the game: contract work, design / alpha / beta phases, debugging, marketing, distribution channels, support (fixing bugs reported by customers), team leadership, market shares, server management, competitors... Heck, you even hire cleaners and IT support to maintain your office.\n\nDespite its depth, it's easy to learn, thanks to the tutorials that appear automatically each time you try something new. I'm usually not into management games and I don't like micro-management, but here nothing seemed tedious, and so far my game sessions have been very enjoyable. I'm waiting to see how it scales up with many employees and a big office.\n\nSince it's in early access, there's no music (yet) and not many sound effects. Just use your usual music player and you will be good to go. Apart from that, it feels like a polished game already and I didn't encounter any bugs.\n\nThis is a little gem that can only get better.","June 13, 2015","true","9.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I tried the demo and it totally amazed me. After trying it I realized it's nothing like GDT, but a completely different genre and style. I'm still amazed that this is made by one person and this is still in alpha. The only thing I do not like about this game is the building style which will probably be fixed in the future. This still has so much to be added and I can't wait to see it. This is one of my favorite games and I can't wait to see what the developer adds in the future.

It took me a few tries to figure out the mechanics and to have a game where I didn't go bankrupt.  Here is a small pro/con breakdown:\n\npros;\n-Feels like a class tycoon game, start from the bottom and work to the top\n-Has a plethora of in game tasks to keep the player busy, from managing teams to seeking out contracts to complete all the way to building up your offices to expand for more employees.\n-On the other spectrum, it also has a "Sims" feel meaning you can literally build new rooms/buildings for more space, place equipment & furniture, each having direct impact on your firm.\n-The interface is aesthetically pleasing to the eyes and is easy to interpret.\n-Spreadsheets & numbers for the statistic-savy folks.\n-In game stock market including loans you can withdraw for more cash on hand to do whatever with.\n-And by the looks of it many many other features i haven't yet experienced.\n\nCons;\n-Albeit the game is in alpha, there is still glaring room for improvement.\n-Graphics/Audio are by no means on a AAA standard, so if you are wanting some crazy high-resolution ultra HDR direct x90000 quality graphics, move along. (This isn't really a con for me, i don't care about graphics or audio for these types of games).\n-Some finicky in game mechanics could use some fleshing out such as how effectiveness & happiness numbers really work.\n-A few graphical glitches but do not have an impact on gameplay.\n\nOne last line,\n\nThis game has so much potential, a fellow Dane appears to be the primary (or only?) developer for this title, and so far he/she is off to a great start. I will continue playing, and will follow development closely.","May 19, 2015","true","14.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It combines advanced tycoon gameplay with real-life scenarios and products. You build your facilities, manage your employees and develop a variety of software through many different avenues.

This is a simulation game in the idealogy of creating a technology company building softwares and accepting contract work where you can choose to build a simple office with one or more floors up, starting with 1 employee or hiring and managing multiple teams of employees, and managing financial markets and stocks.  Your decisions with real life scenarios can lead you to success or failure in the game.\n\nThe devs seem to be updating at a decent pace, and they currently have a fun competition going on.

It's fun being creative and trying different ways of getting your company off the ground.\n- After having a scroll through the news, it seems this game is updated pretty regularly and just gets better and better.\n\nWhat I'd like to see:\n- MUSIC! I appreciate all the little sounds (the typing of the keyboard, the birds chirping, etc), but it gets really dry without any music. I suggest something relaxing, something along the lines of the infamous Minecraft soundtrack.\n- The user interface is good for the most part, but there are still some small problems that are fine at first but get very frustrating with repetition. Many of these problems occur because of a lack of information when you need it and the player needs to backtrack through menus to find it. Players get really specific in the discussion board when they address these problems, let's get them fixed!\n- I find that the interest on insurace is a bit too high later in the game... I got to a point where I'm making millions, yet my reputation is low, my workers are unhappy, and my products are not the best... I have so much money that I can buy out every other company that even begins to try to make a product. Quite hilarious... but boring once it gets to that point.","November 24, 2015","true","20.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It took me a few tries to figure out the mechanics and to have a game where I didn't go bankrupt.  Here is a small pro/con breakdown:\n\npros;\n-Feels like a class tycoon game, start from the bottom and work to the top\n-Has a plethora of in game tasks to keep the player busy, from managing teams to seeking out contracts to complete all the way to building up your offices to expand for more employees.\n-On the other spectrum, it also has a "Sims" feel meaning you can literally build new rooms/buildings for more space, place equipment & furniture, each having direct impact on your firm.\n-The interface is aesthetically pleasing to the eyes and is easy to interpret.\n-Spreadsheets & numbers for the statistic-savy folks.\n-In game stock market including loans you can withdraw for more cash on hand to do whatever with.\n-And by the looks of it many many other features i haven't yet experienced.\n\nCons;\n-Albeit the game is in alpha, there is still glaring room for improvement.\n-Graphics/Audio are by no means on a AAA standard, so if you are wanting some crazy high-resolution ultra HDR direct x90000 quality graphics, move along. (This isn't really a con for me, i don't care about graphics or audio for these types of games).\n-Some finicky in game mechanics could use some fleshing out such as how effectiveness & happiness numbers really work.\n-A few graphical glitches but do not have an impact on gameplay.\n\nOne last line,\n\nThis game has so much potential, a fellow Dane appears to be the primary (or only?) developer for this title, and so far he/she is off to a great start. I will continue playing, and will follow development closely.","May 19, 2015","true","14.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

When I say that I mean imagine a game where your Sims can have a custom job and live in a custom made office with your own staff and everything. So far I was able to sample the game enough to get a fair and accurate review of Software Inc. and I have to say... its different.\n\nI made a boss named the Canadian Devil and the business Pay2Win Inc. I first didn't understand how the staffing worked but I played a few game developer clones and quickly found my way around although I had to restart a couple times. My first mistake was making 2 rooms one with a kitchen and one the main office but found out that you can only have one team per room and so I stuck my advertising team in the kitchen with the bathrooms, the team would call in sick then quit after two months reporting to news that well I was the Canadian Devil not letting them pee and eat. Then I realized every project I started took six to eight months to just get the bare minimum and have the reviews say "surprise Pay2Win made yet another bad product." and only sell 50 units. I finally found out that you can take on jobs for other businesses to earn some quick and more effective cash however sending staff to school seemed like more of sending them to Las Vegas for a week.\n\nOverall the game delivered what it said it was but there's 1 glaring issue that should be addressed minus the 4x timer sometimes makes the time go faster and the workers stay at 2x but the lack of a good tutorial to show players what does what and why. Don't get me wrong I still recommend this game but I recommend it as a fun "The Sims at work" type game for now. I'll keep this review updated.","June 3, 2015","true","3.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You have a overiew your employees, what they need to do, their skills, their negative skills, effectiveness, and can see if anyone is idle, at work, sick or at home.\n\nIn the game you will have a overview as a leader to make your  employees do assigned jobs, which you agreed to with other companies. There will be a payment, marketing, successrate, and overall overview of groups people are assigned into. You can assign groups for different people, with different skills for different rooms. - Also, you can hire cleanup crew, It-supporter, receptionist etc. If you make a good profit you can make contact to shops for phsycal copies etc. etc.\n\nEverything has it effect on the game. If you make a company without cooling, your servers will be have critical issues, and of course the game will have more content besides this.\n\nOverall designing of the game is really good. I don't like how you must make rooms to the last wall, instead of using the "sims skill" for making anything around cornors or that there isn't any music / bagground / in-game music. Without the music, you will feel a bit of emptyness which might let you quit unless you got a touch for the game it self.\n\nThe game it self has surprisingly alot to offer, where i would mark this game for the advanced user who like to have control of every single detail etc. insurance. So if you like advanced games that's "Sims mixed up with simcity" look a like, where you can touch any detail, which you do in-real life aswell, then this game is for you.\n\nIf you think something else, well.

I did GearCity EA and enjoyed seeing that game grow.  I really don't have any negatives to say about Software, Inc.  It's a more detailed version of Game Dev Tycoon.  It also appears that there is still so much more to come in the games deveolopment as well.  There is plenty of micro-managing and some help to decrease that as you grow.  More tools to reduce that would be helpful and should come if not from developer from workshop.  The game has challenging components to it, and even if you have tons of money can turn on the dime with a few bad decisions or development choices.

It's not exactly "The Sims", but it gets the job done, once you've memorized the categorization of items. The building part is solid. It all happens on grids, but then again you are building an office and not a theme park. It doesn't throw standard rooms at you. The game gives you the freedom to build and think about your layout and build a muli storied building to be proud of, because those things aren't cheap to build.\n\nSpeaking of money, the economy in this game is maybe not the best presented, but DEFINITELY the most detailed of all current indie games about management. It's all there; A field of competitors putting out their games, a stock market of your competitors, including hostile takeovers, aswell as a software market that is ever shifting from one product to the next. Distribution channels matter. Marketing matters. You create your own office and structure it in groups and rooms that help you engineer the software. The other companies will always keep you on your toes!\nIf you don't have the leading Operating System at the beginning of the Game, there will be a decision to be made: Go with your hope on your own OS, but a small portion of the market, or bow to the big guy and just develop tools for his OS. If you make more money than him that way, you might actually be able to buy the next bigger company. Sweet monopoly!\n\nYou can take your company on many paths in the game. You don't have to be a video game company, as in all the other games. You can be the guys that do tech support for other companies and do contract work in separate teams. You can stay a small company and just serve a high priced niché product, like putting out the best 2D or 3D graphics tool. You can be a company that just creates marketing bubbles, etc.\n\nThe path to success isn't an easy one at first. You will have to put some effort into the first hours. The way I learned, was to try over and over again on a limited budget, without endulging the 500k starting option, which is also there. If you do well in the beginning, you can take a 100k loan over 2 years and actually pay it back!\n\nThe game is steadily developing, but not exactly at the speed of light. The technology is solid and it's completely playable with lots of features. The detail in some parts of the game, makes you wish for even more options and challenges. I literally wished, the game ran at a slower pace, but gave me more trouble in the day-to-day management. I barely remember any of the workers names after a game. They are totally just numbers, because they are looking like little plastic figures.\n\nIf I have to fire Karen from accounting (accounting should also be in the game and isn't btw.), it should feel a bit of a downer, because I should be able to see the sad little face afterwards and I'm not, which ironically gives me a sad face, which you can't see either.\n\nTL;DR\n\nSolid stuff; Walls of Numbers; Detailed Market; Learning Curve\nbuy it, play it, love it.

I love the concept and it is implemented quite well except there are many things that need to be improved.\n\nPros:\n+ Really fun to play (one of those games where you look up and realise you've lost half the day.. and night)\n+ Graphics aren't mindblowing but are fit for purpose\n+ A lot more options and content then Game dev Tycoon\n\nCons:\n- Gui needs serios work, why can't I shift camera angles with the mouse, everything is on the keyboard\n- Some important info menus are missing, I can't find anything that shows a breakdown of my sales for the month\n- Building mechanics are a little backwards and need improvement. Parking lots are laid down opposite to their icon for instance. You also cannot delete walls and you need enclose a whole square on existing walls before walls are set. Why can't I just lay a single section of walls, to create a passage way between two rooms for instance.\n- Need more furniture and upgrades. There is too much of a gap between 1990 and 2000\n- The interface for assigning teams to projects needs to be in a single screen, where you can drag and drop and see where they allocated/overallocated\n- What about creating toilet cubicles.... why must I enclose each toilet with a wall?\n- I don't understand/like the HR manager and Project Manager implementation, why aren't these separate roles like IRL\n- I know the same is about Software, but why not introduce a Hardware manufacturing element (DLC maybe?). Would be fund to be an Apple/Microsoft and Manufacture the hardware to go with my Phone software/Console etc.\n- Pricing: There should be a metric indicating public price sensitivity. Otherwise it's a guessing game. Perhaps you can commission a report to see what people think about your product and suggested pricing points?\n- Time to develop should increase with better equipment, it doesn't feel like this every changes\n- Servers never seem to keep up with demand and the wiring mechanic is screwed. Why can't they all be linked together, there seems to be some arbitrary limitation that is beyond comprehension?!!?\n- Stocks: There has to be a better way to implement this. Also it would be cool to be able to take control of companies after you own more than 50% and set their objectives. i.e. what they can and can't make. I'd also like to be able to set their dividens level, some like in capitalism.\n\nDon't let the many con's above put you off this game, it is really cool and well worth the money, it just needs a good few tweaks to make it awesome.\n\n","May 21","true","23.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's not yet at MGT's level, but it's definitely got the potential to catch up and surpass it.  There are still some bugs/improvements needed, but it's already incredible.  I can't wait to see what the finished product is like.\n\nPros:\nManaging teams is just complex enough to be fun without being overwhelming.\nBeing able to grow the building size, rather than moving as in other games allows for more "organic" growth of the business, you can look back and kind of trace your steps, which is pretty neat.\nManaging the hours the staff and cleaning crews work is pretty fun, making sure no time is wasted.\n\nCons:\n- At times employees get stuck, and it can be hard to locate them.\n- Employees can at times have too much difficulty finding restrooms (and other things effecting happiness.)  I found my buildings requiring far more restrooms than would make sense in the real world.\n- The room building leaves something to be desired, new rooms have to be made outside the existing walls, or must be made all the way across a room (rather than making a room from a square quarter of an existing room, you have to make a wall from the north wall all the way to the south wall, instead of north wall to middle of the west wall)\n- Not yet much customization with office items, I suspect that is coming though, this is being written just 9 days after the EA release.\n\nDespite the cons, I promise you, this is an amazing game already.

The focus is currently more on the HR and business side then on the software side.  You need to purchase insurance so you can intice better employees, there are a limited amount of features that can be placed on the products you create so the emphasis is when to build it (competing for market share) as opposed to what features you cram in.  For an EA game, it runs fine and once you get a handle on making money. The game is fun but too easy after the first big software deal.\n\nEdit 1/27/16\nStill returning to this game. I've enjoyed the updates that happen on a regular basis.  The building system is vastly improved over the previous build.  The developer is obviously spending time and adjusting the game due to to feedback from the community, which is what EA is all about.\n\nI still find that once I'm able to make an outstanding OS there is very little to do as you have all the money you need.  Sure, you can buy out competitors and continue to build staff and develop other projects, but this becomes tedious when you no longer need to worry about how you will pay staff.\n\nI'm looking forward to more items being implemented in the building mode, and balancing between starting and maintaining.\n\nOverall still a buy if you dig on these kind of games.  Probably 10-12 hours in your first company, on the current build.","October 18, 2015","true","59.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

I played the other 'video game' tycoon-like games and this one gets a lot more detailed. Not only can you make video games but you could run your company entirely as an office software company, phone OS, tech support or even just a server farm. You can build you own multi-story building or even build it underground. You can hire and fire employees, send them to school, put them on different teams or just let them hang out in the break room 24/7.\n\nEvery update has something new and cool to try out. At the time of this writing they have added 'research'. It's not a TRULY awesome feature yet but what is there is pretty cool and will be awesome when it gets fleshed out.\n\nThis leaves me wondering how awesome this game will be when it is considered "finished".\n\nIf only all early access games were this playable.","April 20","true","55.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I've had moments where I was like 'yeah this is awesome!' when things were going well with my business, and then there were many more times where I had to just keep starting over and struggling to 'figure out how to be successfull' through watching vidoes for tips. At the end of the day, it has some awesome Sims-esque building and people-management, but it can get bogged down with text-heavy menus and tons of starting over (at least when you are new at it).\n\nI hesitate to recommend it outright - it would probably be wise to watch some LetsPlays first to really make sure you know what you are getting into.\n\nPros:\n+Graphical style is very nice\n+Building and designing office buildings is really fun here\n+Ambient sounds are nice, and the day-to-day gameplay is just as fun as The Sims\n\nCons:\n-Being successful, for me, was less of using my intuition and figuring things out, and more of 'learning' how others do it in videos and using that as a springboard\n-Menus are very text-heavy, and I am sad to say that many glitch out for me (yeah starting over works, among other tips on the forums, but in a game that so heavily focuses on menus, this is not a fun thing)\n-I've spoken with the developer about this, and we agree to disagree, but I need to mention it here: the way the day/month time system is set up in this game is screwed up. As is, one day = one month, and it really doesn't make sense. Is it fixable? Apparently not. Why did we get to this point? Good question.\n-I didn't find it fun choosing some of the options, such as 'personality' of your main character and day-scaling, among others\n\nThis is a real niche genre game. I had some fun, but overall I really think the consumer needs to know exactly what they are getting into here.","October 20, 2015","false","4.0"," 35 of 76 people (46%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","46","35","76","5","4"

I personally like the fact that its very complicated since it makes it more of a brain exercise.\n\nHowever starting a game is very difficult. The default starting cash is $10,000 (you can change it). The real estate for your first office will cost you half of that. Then you have to pay a crap ton of money for the licenses for your project. I personally found it convuluted that you had 20-30+ operating systems to choose from, all very expensive to acquire licenses. Completely blown away that there were no Open Source license options when starting out, especially since the whole point is to "start lean" and grow into a larger company.\n\nThe controls are a bit weird. You use WASD to move around the map and UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT to operate the camera. Personally my natural reaction is to click on the ground and drag around until the camera view is perfect. The developer should change it to this way because WASD+arrows+MOUSE is too much functionality to handle when you are also dealing with a very complex UI.\n\nIf I gave it more of a chance I would probably like it more. I love the concept and 80% of the execution is there. I actually prefer it to stay complex as it is because it differentiates it from the other game tycoon games.\n\nMy suggestion is to start the game as a loner in a garage, since that is easier to handle rather than throwing all of these resources at the user from the get go. My $0.02 and I'm glad I could provide an early access review.","February 17","false","3.4"," 4 of 16 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","4","16","0","1"

In fact I think this game is quite good for the right audiance.\n\nIn fact part of me likes the game and its charm. Yet I always feel that games need negative reviews in order to give people a more balanced idea of what it is being offered here.\n\nBasically the best way I could describe the game is: What if you could build a software development factory using automotons that were fueled by coffee? and that has its appeal, it is up to you to make the best possible layout to give you the best possible results in *beep* Insert product #246 here *beep* and building your entire floorplan to make sure that your robots bump into other robots less often.\n\nNow because your workers are robots of course your products are also made robotically. *Beep* Making Videogame #34, inserting GUI, Inserting 3d models... *Beep* basically all software is made out of lego blocks so to speak you just attach different features onto a product and the game tells you how good it "potentially" is and even how "innovative" it is (because robot). You then craft the product by working on it until it is of sufficient quality. They will even hammer it out on a keyboard as if they really were robots (and I am not convinced they arn't)\n\nTHIS is what I think the game excels at. If this makes you want to get the game do so now!\n\nBut in terms of being a software tycoon it will not satisfy. The products feel like they don't even exist within the game universe and the game has an odd way of spoonfeeding you information that you should infer yourself (How innovative a product is) as well as not telling you upfront what information you would want to know (Who is buying your product). Thus after spending a long time on what might me your magnus opus your overall attitude towards it will probably be "Ok, I guess it was made".\n\nAs well because the people are all robots and software is made of legos the whole "I am doing something creative and intellectual" aspect is kind of lost. When a game is just a list of features with "stats" on how "good" and "Innovative" it makes it, it stops feeling like a game.\n\nDon't get the game for the wrong reasons, I hope this helped you get a bit more of an educated idea.","May 10, 2015","false","1.3"," 45 of 125 people (36%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","36","45","125","4","24"

Tedium is another good word. Unlike Mad Games Tycoon (to which it seems to copy) it takes much too long to do anything in the game.  You have to develop an operating system, you have to have a fair amount of money in your insurance pool to hire good employees (in the 80's???) the contracts are tedious and never ending. Even if you set one day to equal one month, think of how much time is passing before you even get to game development.  Three and a half years to develop an operating system. The graphics are primitive. For a game which places so much emphasis on minutiae they could have done better with the graphics.\n\nDon't put two toilets in one bathroom, your employees don't like the coffee. All of this takes away from the one thing the GAME should be focused on, developing video games in the early days of the digital era. Mad Games Tycoon does it so much better. This game is not an improvement over it. I'm sure the fans will vote my review down, but it's an honest review and reflects what is discussed in the forums.  If you kike spending hours waiting for results, this is your game.. If you want a good game that reflects the early digital era and beyond, stick with Mad Games Tycoon.","June 8, 2015","false","4.1"," 12 of 62 people (19%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","19","12","62","0","5"

It is a more complicated version of Game Dev Tycoon, but just not pleasing to look at. For a game that requires you to look at menus and menus and more menus, or watch people smash their computers all the time. I would really like it to look pretty. Also no music really makes the game a lot worse. It's kind of really annoying hearing cars go by 24/7. Might get better as the Alpha goes on, will look at it again in the future.

But ever since last night I hate this game. first off he ruined the building system because in the old update he had it to where you would have to build a room around a room inorder to merge rooms. Now its where you select two rooms (remember that) and you right click them and click "merge rooms" and it will merge the rooms. it is better than the old system exept that there is one gaping flaw. That flaw being is that you cant select TWO rooms at once. you can only select ONE room (okay I guess you can select more than one room by selecting the entire building) and not TWO. So what you have to do is you have to select the entire building and click "merge rooms" and as far as I know there is no way to select two rooms. so there, this game was ruined by a single new building mecanic. great job. Tell me if there is a way to select two rooms at once other than selecting the entire building.","August 14, 2015","false","73.5"," 1 of 34 people (3%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","3","1","34","3","2"

While there are a lot of functions available to you, in the beginning of the game all you do is contracts, which involve doing nothing apart from staring at the screen and clicking a button to skip time once in a while. You could be doing this for hours to begin with. Especially if you screw up and need to start over.\n\nIf you expect to buy a functioning game that has actual game play look elsewhere, if you want to get directly involved in the early development of this with no expectations then you probably do not care about a review in the first place.\n\nI will be putting this away for a few months and see in a while if it has become more worthwhile.

The commitment they have described for the game and adding features is what makes this game, in my eyes, so promising.

Software Inc. allows you to hire and manage more teams and projects then other games of similar design. Also despite being in EA there is enough content and replayability in this game to beconsidered a worthy EA purchase IMO.\n\nHere are a few additional thoughts on the game. Take them as you will.\n\n-Graphics are okay-ish, you can tell that graphics isn't the focus. But I think a few things could be inproved upon in that area.\n\n-Sound is almost non-existant so fire up your own music.\n\n-Building rooms can be a bit wonky.\n\n-Delegating rooms/tasks...etc is awkward too. I have a hard time assigning rooms to different teams as well as computers.\n\n-Ability to research different tech would be a cool addition.\n\n","May 6, 2015","true","10.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can start off in the 80's and become a company like Microsoft, or start off in the modern era and struggle to compete with the major names in the market. The possibilities are very large, and each playthrough brings different cards to the table with randomly generated stuff and things.\n+ Dynamic Stock Market\n+ Reputation System, has a few kinks here and there, but still, its there.\n\nCons:\n- Glitchy, Clippy, 90's-esque Graphics. If you NEED amazing graphics, this Alpha is not for you.\n- Slightly unbalanced difficulty settings.\n- No music? Minor, but definitely something I enjoy having in a game that takes HOURS at a time to play (D:)\n- Super. F***ing. Needy. Employees. No. Really. Expect to deal with, "I NEED TO PEE, THE BATHROOM IS RIGHT OVER THERE, BUT INSTEAD OF GOING TO THE BATHROOM, IM GOING TO ASK FOR A RAISE." a lot. Cheap, dirty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.\n- Overall, a lot of improvements/fixes/adjustments to be made (that's why it's an Alpha :D)\n\nIf you're into strategies and want to get behind something new, innovative, and extremely addicting, then you've come to the right place. Although there are still PLENTY of bugs at this stage, the developer seems rather set on game development, even if his abilities are limited. Take those twelve bucks you were going to spend on Junk Food to support a great game. :D","June 3, 2015","true","49.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I then kept it in my steam watch list hoping it would be a few quid cheaper in a steam sale (it never has been reduced in a steam sale though), so despite it being early access and constantly updated I decided to pay full price in reflection of the overwhelmingly positive reviews. I have only had one run through so far, but it is an addictive game. I did encounter a few bugs\issues, but am sure these will be fixed as the game is under constant development with things being added and tweaked - I did report one game-breaking bug to the developer and he personally replied really quickly with a detailed explanation of why the bug occured and that it would be fixed in the next update release. There are lots of ways to make money, but some aspects seem random. It would be nice to have set goals to reach, but I expect that will be coming at a later date and I can see how this game would work really well as multiplayer as well.

But that is where the similiarites end as Software Inc. goes beyond that level and brings new stuff to the table.\n\nOne of those items is new stuff to develop such as operating systems, audio and visual tools, antivirus etc. The game tries to simulate the experiences of Microsoft, Google, Apple and various other software companies. The simulation is done quite well imo with all the various software. The game also brings a Sims style office building which is pretty simple. But the building needs improvement such as having to building rooms into rooms without having to merge them which is a pain.\n\nIn this game you compete with other software companies that are generated in the game. Those companies in my opnion are extremely easy to surpass early in the game when you learn the tricks of developing software. it is almost laughable. Those companies rarely surpass the 3-4 million worth point and after that the game just is boring as the your  worth just soars above others. I think the ai should innovative and agressive as the difficulty increases because even on hard after learning the tricks it is easy to beat them. Maybe in the hardest difficulty add a companie that is massive to the point where it almost monopolizes the software industry. I also wish you could engage in greater diplomatic relations with the companies besides doing these small errands your recive at the reciponist desk. Maybe allow a deal that allows companies to merge into one giant company or allow large companies to form subsidaries of bankrupt companies.\n\nIt would alse be nice to add a historcal feature into the game later on that follows the history of software companies as they progress through the eras. Allow products that were made in software history such as games and OS to give a historical feel to the game similair to Game Dev Tycoon. The software you developed in the game also easy to master. you just wait a few months or years and look you produced a masterful product and your just earning mad money. Thats maybe one of the reasons why i think the softwares your develop are soo lifeless.\n\nOverall, i would probably give this game a 6/10 for where it is right now but this game has MASSIVE POTENTIAL to be amazing with hopefully better company ai and interactions, better build mode, better software development, etc.","July 9, 2015","true","21.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The reason why it took an hour was because the compatibility between each member in the team affects the general productivity of the team, and I accidentally made quick teams out of the current members I had rather than adding each member to a team that they were compatible with.\nIt was about 4-5 hours into that save that was going well until I noticed that I haven't been working on new products or doing contract work, that my company was now officially broke and my loans weren't paid off.\n\nThis game is fantastic and I highly recommend it if you can spare the time to slowly drought yourself in financial debt in both reality and a videogame.","February 17","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The irony of playing a game about developing software that is itself a piece of software being developed is also amusing (can't wait to see some more real-life 2D/3D art). However, after playing 54 hours in a single game I will probably not play it for a while until more content is added and/or changes are made to gameplay. I reached a self-declared point of endless monotony in the game far earlier than I expected to. It felt like 'The End' of the game. But then, what I find monotonous may be an enjoyable continuation of a simulation to others.\n\nGranted, I played this game on the Medium/Normal difficulty - the alternatives being Easy or Hard - but I would hate to experience Easy. All said and done, I love the game and it was definitely worth the $14 I paid for it. At this point it's just a simultion that "peaks" to early in my opinion, but I have faith it will be improved significantly as it approaches official release.","February 18","true","54.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But then, I told myself what the heck and gave it a shot.\n\nI don't think it would be fair to compare this and GDT. GTD is a ton of fun with some subtle memories for some gamers from the dark eighties, like I am. But Software Inc is different. You would have a lot more administrative stuff to do, and less detailt development work. Which at first plain suXed, but then again, hey, you run a company, you are not a simple game dev'er.\nIf you understand the game mechanics, it's quite easy on "easy" and "medium", I hope it will be more challenging on "hard" though, but I haven't tried that yet.\n\nUndoubtly, Software Inc is highly addictive, be it for building an awesome company HQ, be it for that one uber operating system. Also, it's addictive if you are into micro management stuff!\nOnly thing is: you will need to be into simulation games. But then, it's great fun to play.\n\nI am keeping away from the Cons, as this is early access and I am sure the devs will change stuff until the release!\n\n\n8/10, there's so much potential in Software Inc!

For the negative comments: it seems like they didn't even go through the tutorials. No, you don't have to create your own OS in the beginning, you can start with contracts (like in Game Dev). Or you can buy a license to develop for an existing OS or take out a loan. If you want a challenge, start with the lowest amount of cash, don't take out any loans, and do contracts. If you want to sandbox, take out the maximum amount of money, hire a ton of people, make games. It's not that hard.

Nicely made trailer, great concept, very cheap price and I have a weakness for theses kinds of simulation games.\n\nBut unfortunately I cannot recommend a game that is far from a playable state. The tutorials are very in depth, but they wouldn't need to be if the controls where simpler.\n\nThe method of assigning employees to a team doesn't work. My method of making an employee do it's job is look at the tutorial 50 times, do EXACTLY what it told be to do and it still wouldn't work. (I think it is a bug, which is another reason why I can't recommend)\n\nAlso most of the time I had no idea exactly what I had to do after accepting a contract or what was actually required to develop software?\n\nAlso lack of any ambient sounds, and main menu music first made me think that the game was broken, but it turned out that it hadn't be added yet.\n\nIts Early Access. I should have expected an unfinished game.\n\nIn its current state, I would avoid it. But it has serious potential to be an amazing game.\nI wish the Developers good luck.\n\nEDIT:\n\nOnce you get used to the controls, it is infact a great game. And the bug i mentioned appears to be fixed. Hence I now have to recommend this game, although if you want a game where you want to jump right into it, then this isn't for you. You will have to invest a lot of time into it, but it is worth it.\n\nEDIT EDIT: Brilliant Game. Only 1 complaint tho, hiring people and assigning to multiple teams can get confusing, because at 1 point i was hiring for my new game dev team an only realised afterwards that i assigned them all to core by accident.","July 20, 2015","true","36.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

It is very hard to start out, but once you get the hang of it it's a lot easier. I have ran into some bugs, one of which makes the game nearly unplayable, but it is early access so it's understandable. The game doesn't have that much replayablity, but after updates you would want to start again with all of the new features. The graphics are nice for this game, obviously if you've looked at the screenshots it kind of looks like the sims. Building buildings isn't that great, but I'm sure the developer will update it eventually. Overall it's a good game if you like games like it. It's kind of a mix between Game Dev Tycoon and The Sims. Software Inc. doesn't feel like it's made by one person.\n\nUpdate: I reported the bug, and the developer responded within an hour with how to fix it. I now recommend the game even more.

Not only does the developer take an interest in community ideas and suggestions, he implements a lot of them, and asks questions and engages the gamers. Excellent developer for an excellent game.\n\nPros:\n- Excellent simulation of software design\n- Multiple teams and strategies to use when running your company\n- Diverse set of products to make (see cons as well)\n- Very simple to use building designer\n- Easily manageable information (various windows, tables, etc...)\n- Really makes you feel like you're part of a growing software industry as you go from 1980 onward.\n- Realistic staffing simulation (see cons as well)\n- Excellent progress and commitment to updating regularly. GREAT Feedback to supporters\n\nCons:\n- Product diversity could improve (planned in future releases already)\n- Hiring is slightly flawed (should have limited employees available each month, not unlimited at a price of virtual dollars)\n- Graphics can use some upgrades, but it definitely has a unique feel as it currently sits\n- Animations can use work, but this game is about gameplay and content above all else, and in that area, it excels.\n\nOverall:\n- This is the most UNDERRATED Early Access game on Steam. Excellent business simulation, interesting concepts, great design, simple to use, and challenging to really master. Needs some more work, but is regularly updated by development team (one person!!). Excellent response to supporters, and the Dev takes ideas from fans/gamers and runs with them.\n\n9/10 - Recommendation:  BUY NOW!","April 7","true","77.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I bought the game not knowing what to expect because it didn't seem so promising, however after I played 1 session it had me hooked. The amount of detail within the game is amazing and leaves you feeling emotions over firing "good" workers due to the effort you put into educating them to do their jobs correctly. The level of satisfaction I achieved when I released my first Anti-virus that grossed a total of 2 million was amazing.

Support this game if you loved Game Dev Tycoon but thought it was too simplistic and limited.\n\nMechanically, this is what I hoped and wished Game Dev Tycoon to be, after 4 hours of playing it. The game I imagined in my head when thinking about this theme. Mechanically, it's still not finished, but already very good.\n\nContent-wise, even at this stage, it would need more to really make the mechanics work. More than Game Dev Tycoon, while at this point it still has much less. And what content is there is weakly signalled, or not at all (when do researches become available? where do certain software technologies? why can't I influence that by research? making it more a standard research tree and using the times only at least as a partial lock would benefit the game greatly, I think, the player needs at least the theoretical power to leave competition technologically in dust).\n\nAnd for the research to work at all, there needs to be more of the content, more of technologies, I was playing until 2020 because I saw the holocomputer in the build menu and I expected a related technology to appear/unlock at which point I was prepared to throw my whole 60people, 30bilion$ company to creating a holographic networked OS... But no technology came...\n\nI have many suggestions that are better placed in forums, I guess. Also, the interface is a bit... obnoxious when you try to manage larger number of people in larger number of teams.\n\nBut overall, a great start and it seems dev knows where he's headed, and he's headed to a good place. With appropriate amounts of care, resources and time, and polish, this could become a leader in niche that Game Dev Tycoon kinda pioneered/popularized, this could become "The Sims of gamedev management games". The potential is great, and even in its current state it's lots of fun to play.","April 15","true","17.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Admittedly, It doesn't take very long to build up your company to endgame level (having so much money you could never possibly spend it, and quite literally dominating the market)\n\nBut it is an early access game, and there's incredibly frequent updates.\n\nThe best bits about the game so far (in my opinion) are;\n\nIncredibly detailed building mode allows you to construct your very own office for your company, including a basement level and up to ten stories.\nInteresting market simulation generates competitor companies and products.\nIn depth HR management allows you to take control of each of your employees, their salaries, roles, and which team they work in - you can even dictate where they sit and which toilet they use.\nAdjustable timescale is incredibly handy, if you want a quick game you can set it up so that there's only one ingame day per month of the simulation (your employees will come in for a days work and the next day will be a new month) and vice versa.\nThere are, ofcourse things that need some work, and obviously it's a very early alpha so these aren't criticisms -  just things that, in my opinion, aren't all that they could be;\n\nPerformance, I don't know if this is something the Dev can fix or if it's more to do with the engine - but it should be noted that this game doesn't really run all that well. I'm playing with a GTX 980 and an i7 CPU and my system is barely keeping up - the game drops frames especially hard when buildings go over a certain size / too many employees are on the screen.\nThe game is far too easy once you get used to playing. Unlike Game Dev Tycoon which seemed to randomize how well your products would perform - if you make software in Software Inc, it's pretty much guaranteed to sell well unless you make blatantly awful software.\nNot enough furniture (not nescessarily important, I just obsess over customizing my office.)\nAs mentioned earlier, it's easy to make billions in an hour or two and then never have to worry about cash again (aslong as you keep pumping out software) - ideally I'd like to see more ways in which I can spend my money - kind of ties into my above comment but still, it takes some of the fun out of it once you get to Microsoft level of market dominance.\nOverall, I'm having fun with Software Inc, and I look forward to each new update. I appreciate that the developer is active and I am convinced that if he continues to put as much effort in as he has been, this is going to be quite a great game once there's more added to it.\n\nI'd recommend if you're willing to go into the game in it's current state, it is Early Access after all.","March 14","true","49.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For a game thats developed by only one person, its very well done, lots of depth.  This game has you covering every single aspect of your business, from building the actual office, heating and light of the office, hiring cleaning and maintence staff, software development, marketing, server hosting, stocks and buyouts of the other company.  You could also design, develop, and offer support for other companies products for a fee.\n\nEmployee management is pretty big as well, if they arn't happy, they won't work, so you have to try and please your employees.\n\nAll in all, its a great business management style game that will keep you entertained.","March 18","true","34.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have to say that this game is shaping up fantastically, especially considering that it is being developed by just one guy.\n\nI haven't put as many hours in as I would have liked, but I couldn't recommend this game more. Honestly one of the most underrated titles on the Store in my opinion. The Workshop is a little bleak at the minute but with the addition of blueprints it's starting to really flesh itself out now. The developer has provided ample information on his website for those wanting to write small XML files to give themselves £5b and start in 1971.\n\nBottom line: Frequent and substantial updates. A small but growing community via his DevBlog, Twitter, Reddit and the Workshop. An endless simulated market with surprising depth lurking just under the surface of a business management game in which you are in control of almost everything. What more could you ask from an Early-Access title?\n\n11/10, would go backrupt trying to fit 100 employees into a two-story building in the starting area again.","March 27","true","52.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In first 2-3 hrs I was disapppointed and even thought for refund but  after playing this game 7 hrs; I understood it better.

The game is about building up your own Software comapny, with which you can develop software, games, anti-virus programs and so on. The game is a lot deeper than other game dev tycoon games that you will find here on Steam, such as Game Dev Tycoon and Mad Games Tycoon, mainly because you can control  the micromanaging yourself, to the core. The game is a masterpiece and very replayable. Another thing i find astonishing is, that this game is a one-man operation, and he has managed to make such a great and immersive game.

I then kept it in my steam watch list hoping it would be a few quid cheaper in a steam sale (it never has been reduced in a steam sale though), so despite it being early access and constantly updated I decided to pay full price in reflection of the overwhelmingly positive reviews. I have only had one run through so far, but it is an addictive game. I did encounter a few bugs\issues, but am sure these will be fixed as the game is under constant development with things being added and tweaked - I did report one game-breaking bug to the developer and he personally replied really quickly with a detailed explanation of why the bug occured and that it would be fixed in the next update release. There are lots of ways to make money, but some aspects seem random. It would be nice to have set goals to reach, but I expect that will be coming at a later date and I can see how this game would work really well as multiplayer as well.

It is great, it offers a lot of options and is realistic. However, I do not like that once you get on top it is hard to kick you down to the bottom.\n\nI think it can offer more things to develop for. I would enjoy things like making cloud services in later years like 2010. These would have a close interface of how distribution stores are made.  For that the servers would have a hard drive attached to it, the gigabit servers can hold 1-2 TB. Other things like web games would be a welcomed return and host things like online web photo editors. Another addition would be browsers, so we can fight in the browsers wars. As I am asking for this another feature that is great would be actually being an internet service provider.

Unlike Mad Games Tycoon, Software Inc. isn't game focused meaning it doesn't have many expansive game choices.

You can start off in the 80's and become a company like Microsoft, or start off in the modern era and struggle to compete with the major names in the market. The possibilities are very large, and each playthrough brings different cards to the table with randomly generated stuff and things.\n+ Dynamic Stock Market\n+ Reputation System, has a few kinks here and there, but still, its there.\n\nCons:\n- Glitchy, Clippy, 90's-esque Graphics. If you NEED amazing graphics, this Alpha is not for you.\n- Slightly unbalanced difficulty settings.\n- No music? Minor, but definitely something I enjoy having in a game that takes HOURS at a time to play (D:)\n- Super. F***ing. Needy. Employees. No. Really. Expect to deal with, "I NEED TO PEE, THE BATHROOM IS RIGHT OVER THERE, BUT INSTEAD OF GOING TO THE BATHROOM, IM GOING TO ASK FOR A RAISE." a lot. Cheap, dirty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.\n- Overall, a lot of improvements/fixes/adjustments to be made (that's why it's an Alpha :D)\n\nIf you're into strategies and want to get behind something new, innovative, and extremely addicting, then you've come to the right place. Although there are still PLENTY of bugs at this stage, the developer seems rather set on game development, even if his abilities are limited. Take those twelve bucks you were going to spend on Junk Food to support a great game. :D","June 3, 2015","true","49.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But that is where the similiarites end as Software Inc. goes beyond that level and brings new stuff to the table.\n\nOne of those items is new stuff to develop such as operating systems, audio and visual tools, antivirus etc. The game tries to simulate the experiences of Microsoft, Google, Apple and various other software companies. The simulation is done quite well imo with all the various software. The game also brings a Sims style office building which is pretty simple. But the building needs improvement such as having to building rooms into rooms without having to merge them which is a pain.\n\nIn this game you compete with other software companies that are generated in the game. Those companies in my opnion are extremely easy to surpass early in the game when you learn the tricks of developing software. it is almost laughable. Those companies rarely surpass the 3-4 million worth point and after that the game just is boring as the your  worth just soars above others. I think the ai should innovative and agressive as the difficulty increases because even on hard after learning the tricks it is easy to beat them. Maybe in the hardest difficulty add a companie that is massive to the point where it almost monopolizes the software industry. I also wish you could engage in greater diplomatic relations with the companies besides doing these small errands your recive at the reciponist desk. Maybe allow a deal that allows companies to merge into one giant company or allow large companies to form subsidaries of bankrupt companies.\n\nIt would alse be nice to add a historcal feature into the game later on that follows the history of software companies as they progress through the eras. Allow products that were made in software history such as games and OS to give a historical feel to the game similair to Game Dev Tycoon. The software you developed in the game also easy to master. you just wait a few months or years and look you produced a masterful product and your just earning mad money. Thats maybe one of the reasons why i think the softwares your develop are soo lifeless.\n\nOverall, i would probably give this game a 6/10 for where it is right now but this game has MASSIVE POTENTIAL to be amazing with hopefully better company ai and interactions, better build mode, better software development, etc.","July 9, 2015","true","21.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is about building up your own Software comapny, with which you can develop software, games, anti-virus programs and so on. The game is a lot deeper than other game dev tycoon games that you will find here on Steam, such as Game Dev Tycoon and Mad Games Tycoon, mainly because you can control  the micromanaging yourself, to the core. The game is a masterpiece and very replayable. Another thing i find astonishing is, that this game is a one-man operation, and he has managed to make such a great and immersive game.

I have to say that this game is shaping up fantastically, especially considering that it is being developed by just one guy.\n\nI haven't put as many hours in as I would have liked, but I couldn't recommend this game more. Honestly one of the most underrated titles on the Store in my opinion. The Workshop is a little bleak at the minute but with the addition of blueprints it's starting to really flesh itself out now. The developer has provided ample information on his website for those wanting to write small XML files to give themselves £5b and start in 1971.\n\nBottom line: Frequent and substantial updates. A small but growing community via his DevBlog, Twitter, Reddit and the Workshop. An endless simulated market with surprising depth lurking just under the surface of a business management game in which you are in control of almost everything. What more could you ask from an Early-Access title?\n\n11/10, would go backrupt trying to fit 100 employees into a two-story building in the starting area again.","March 27","true","52.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is great, it offers a lot of options and is realistic. However, I do not like that once you get on top it is hard to kick you down to the bottom.\n\nI think it can offer more things to develop for. I would enjoy things like making cloud services in later years like 2010. These would have a close interface of how distribution stores are made.  For that the servers would have a hard drive attached to it, the gigabit servers can hold 1-2 TB. Other things like web games would be a welcomed return and host things like online web photo editors. Another addition would be browsers, so we can fight in the browsers wars. As I am asking for this another feature that is great would be actually being an internet service provider.

Support this game if you loved Game Dev Tycoon but thought it was too simplistic and limited.\n\nMechanically, this is what I hoped and wished Game Dev Tycoon to be, after 4 hours of playing it. The game I imagined in my head when thinking about this theme. Mechanically, it's still not finished, but already very good.\n\nContent-wise, even at this stage, it would need more to really make the mechanics work. More than Game Dev Tycoon, while at this point it still has much less. And what content is there is weakly signalled, or not at all (when do researches become available? where do certain software technologies? why can't I influence that by research? making it more a standard research tree and using the times only at least as a partial lock would benefit the game greatly, I think, the player needs at least the theoretical power to leave competition technologically in dust).\n\nAnd for the research to work at all, there needs to be more of the content, more of technologies, I was playing until 2020 because I saw the holocomputer in the build menu and I expected a related technology to appear/unlock at which point I was prepared to throw my whole 60people, 30bilion$ company to creating a holographic networked OS... But no technology came...\n\nI have many suggestions that are better placed in forums, I guess. Also, the interface is a bit... obnoxious when you try to manage larger number of people in larger number of teams.\n\nBut overall, a great start and it seems dev knows where he's headed, and he's headed to a good place. With appropriate amounts of care, resources and time, and polish, this could become a leader in niche that Game Dev Tycoon kinda pioneered/popularized, this could become "The Sims of gamedev management games". The potential is great, and even in its current state it's lots of fun to play.","April 15","true","17.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The dev (Khornel, Coredumping) is the most responsive developer I've ever encountered.

It was a great game then, and it just keeps getting better.\nThe developer is putting full studios to shame by constantly updating the game and giving feedback. He is very commited to this project and it is refreshing to see developers who are actually working towards improving and finishing their products.\n\nEven in the game's current state it is one of the best management/tycoon games I have played. It is a very detailed and enjoyable simulation that has hooked me for many hours.\n\nThe building system has been improved drastically over the last couple months, though a little more variety in furniture will be appreciated. I must admit though, for those who are only intrested in the managment gameplay and not the building features the current system is much more than sufficient. Anyway, the developer is adding more furniture quite regularly so this shouldn't be a concern.\n\nSound effects are lacking though. There is no music and the sound effects aren't particularly glorious, but I have solved that by just listening to my own music in the background to break the silence on my 18 hour game sessions.\n\nThis is a good game already, and I cannot wait for the finished product. I highly recommend this game to players you enjoy company management titles.\n\nBy far the best early access game I have played.\n\n99.9%","April 23","true","66.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In a good way of course, it is fun (if you love tycoon games) and there are mods on the workshop that make the game even more cool! In my opinion this game without any mods is realistic (okay maybe not completely but still) and I love that! When you first start you might have the tutorials enabled; but I will say this. Those tutorials were hard to understand, and mainly because I'm a visual learner. Anyways, you might have to watch a few videos to understand how to use it at first. If you are very new to this kind of game, you need to understand that you won't be able to just out of the blue have enough money to make like 20 Audio Tools.

You then slowly build up your company into a softweare empire, I start my first project being a hardrive in six months and by 1981 I have some RAM; I desgin my first motherboard by 1982. I like hire my first marketing team after my first few succeseses; Marketing is everything.\n\nSo by 1985 I redsing everything and then relase my first graphics card and fan kit by 1992. So by 1993 I can make my first computer.\n\nIn essence I build my company from my avatar, to tweleve people, to the core team plus a six man marketing crew; after that I expand as I can afford.\n\nThat is a typical game expirnce. I haven't played by 1995 yet but I hop to soon!","June 2","true","48.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The amount of things you can do in this game is a decent size for early access. Like gam dev tycoon, this game gets very addictive, like very addictive.
