Look don't ask just buy it, you won't regret it. In particular buy the master collection, i'll explain why below:\n\nWhy buy Master? Master comes with all the factions fully playable in multiplayer and single player skirmishes, that's why. Simply download, install and play all of them at least once and you have full access to everything. You get 9-10 factions all together, 9-10 factions that all play /very/ differently with their own fun and unique tactics.\n\nso look i'll do a review just for fun, but hurry up and buy it, you won't regret it:\n\nPros:\n\nFun open campaign: None of this boring DOW:II campaigns where its "OH LOOK ITS THE SPACE MARRINES WE'RE SO SPACE MARINEY"\n\nDiverse factions: Space Marines, Imperial Guads, Necrons, Tau, Eldar etc don't play alike, at all. They each play very differently and are relatively balanced. Try them out they're also all flavoured differently so if you're into BDSM I suggest playing Dark Eldar. If you're a pyromaniac who loves girls with big guns, may I direct you to the Sisters of Battle. If you're a ♥♥♥♥♥ I will direct you to the Space Marines. If you're a ♥♥♥♥♥ with some angst I would direct you to the Chaos Space Marines.\n\nMultiplayer: By gaming standards this game is old, but there is still an active multiplayer community, thats more then DOW:II can really say.\n\nArmy Painter: Ever look at your GLORIOUS IMPERIAL GUARD WITH BALLS OF ♥♥♥♥ING STEEL and say, gee they look stupid, they NEED TO BE ♥♥♥♥ING PINK, well guess what: You can customize the colour schemes for your army, if you want to create an army of Pink Necrons or Imperial Guards from the Planet majesta then go on ahead and do it.\n\nReplay value: This game has a lot of replay value in multiplayer and campaigns.\n\nCONS:\n\nGraphics are a bit dated, but thats okay, it means it can run on your rig.\n\nthe multiplayer can be difficult at times, i've lost sometimes very fast.\n\nNO Tyranids. I think there are mods that fix this but I don't bother with them, I hated the Tyranids in DOW:II OP AS ♥♥♥♥. This might be a pro, idk.\n\nGuides are currently "Meh" on the steam community section, most of them being troll guides.\n\nSome  SPESS MEHREENS (Space Marines) chapters are not represented beyond some pre-made skins for them. So if you're expecting to bring out some Space Wolves the best you'll get is some light blue power armour for your  SPESS MEHREENS. But, who cares they're  SPESS MEHREENS.\n\n\nFinal notes: IF you're still reading this you're wasting your time when you could be burning the heretics and slaying the Xenos in the name of the EMPRAH. But in all seriousness Soulstorm is a recommended one to buy along with any other expansion as soulstorm is where peep's go to play multiplayer. But Soulstorm only comes with Dark Eldar and Sisters of battle. See other expansions for their factions. Or buy the Master collection.","March 15, 2015","true","36.8"," 149 of 164 people (91%) found this review helpful 61 people found this review funny","91","149","164","61","14"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CDFW/recommended/9450/","CDFW","Riko","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CDFW/","1005 products in account","As far as RTS's go, I dont like them. Too many of them do their systems too incorrectly, or just dont plain make any logical sense, or reason. Dawn of War (all the expansion packs, consider this a recommendation for Dawn of War + all of the expansions), does some critical things right, which makes it stand out from the crowd.\n\nFirst, it actually focuses on strategy for the most part. Instead of spamming 1000 tanks at your enemy (im looking at you Ruse), you actually have chose a limited number of units to bring into battle. Meaning, every man, tank, and resourse is valuble, and losing any of the above can cost you the battle. This tension, and balencing on the brink of death keeps tension high, as players must constantly have to outdo their opponent on a mental capacity, not necessarily on a quanitative capacity. This conbined with some rather unique in game mechanics, such as morale, means interesting strategies can arise, when those similar would fall flat in other RTS's.\n\nAnd secondly, the game is able to keep a consistent feeling, tone, and atmosphere. Even for a strategy game, this is important, nothing takes you out of a game more than an interface, so even immersing the mission select screen in 40k does its job. Everything is plastered with 40k jargon and logic, a dark universe of war, death, and betrayal. As well, the game itself feels fitting, with you not taking resources, just getting requisition points to send in more troops, as you are successful in conquest, just as an example of many different things the game does right.\n\nThe game is fitting, and is able to keep a consistent feel to gameplay and atmosphere. For this, I must heartily recommend Dawn of War to RTS fans, you will not be let down.","September 3, 2013","true","78.3"," 125 of 137 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","125","137","0","3"

Look to the other comments for that ♥♥♥♥.  I am simply giving a story and some true as Khorne is bloodthirsty observations.  As I begin remember that in the future, there is only war.  One must choose his battlecry well.  For the Greater Good.\n\nOne of the best RTS games out there.  Nothing quite beats some of the moments the game brings on.  The following is a part of a game I did (in skirmish) against the ai with 6 bots vs just my ai partner and I:\n\nAs I looked at my minimap, I realized my buddy's base was quickly getting overwhelmed.  His outer defenses were obliterated not a few minutes ago, and yet the enemy was closing in around his HQ.  He was building guardsmen as quickly as he could but the onslaught of orks, chaos space marines, and necrons were too much.  His commander made a valiant last stand, but it was in vain...I was then alone.\n\nI scrutinized my defenses and realized I was lacking.  I quickly built many turrets as my first line of defense with some space marines around a pass that funneled the enemy forces down and caused them to lose some of the advantage of numbers.  My second line were multiple heavy tanks with melee infantry further behind the pass.  The purpose of this line was a bullet magnet while my base spit out as many units as I could for a heroic last stand.  The third line was whoever else was left at the time the other two lines fell.  As I checked my units upgrades and made sure they had all they could have, then I saw a red tide on the minimap.  I realized the Emperor would be seeing us soon in the next life.\n\nAs the enemy forces through themselves at the turrets, I couldn't help but realize the corpses of the dead.  The game has an option that leaves almost all the corpses on the field, and I recommend to turn it on to the max as it adds satisfaction to the price your men are paying.  The turrets and supporting infantry could only hold on for so long.  Before the line was breached I was in about a 7:1 kd ratio.  After the line was broken, it became a 1:1.  I zoomed in close for a final look at these men, and I grinned for I knew we would all be joining him soon.  The second line held for about half the time.  The third and final line consisted of my commander and everyone else that had not died.  I waited until the enemy was within weapon's range, then I lit them up with artillery, orbital strikes, and the last two flyers I had.  Then, my men charged.  They went down valiantly with many enemies dead in the process.\n\nI knew there was no chance for victory from the very beginning, but I watched as my commander made his final defiant yell, I was sad there was never a chance.  I was fighting for time, and I got a lot of time.  We fought until the final drop of blood was spilt, until the final breath was exhaled, until the fat ♥♥♥ ho sang, until the bitter end.\n\nThese are the moments that define gaming, not the scripted ones that everyone encounters, but the ones that are player-made.  The game modes where the goal is to kill the enemy commander, and you are completely surrounded on all sides and you make a final charge to kill him to gain victory, and you see your numbers fall from 30 to 23 to 14 to 6 until all you have left is two guardsmen (they die sooooooo easily) and a tank that has a third of its health left and you win.  You win against all the odds, and you smirk at the trail of the men that died for victory.  I cannot tell you of all the awesomeness that is this game.  Go get it.\n\nIN THE GRIM DARKNESS OF THE FAR FUTURE THERE IS ONLY WAR.  AND A METRIC ♥♥♥♥ TON (THAT IS A ♥♥♥♥ING MEASUREMENT) OF ENEMY INFANTRY.","October 27, 2014","true","50.7"," 116 of 125 people (93%) found this review helpful 28 people found this review funny","93","116","125","28","4"

Nothing has been quite the same since.\n\nThe addition of two races in the final expansion of what I daresay is the RTS of the decade was not surprising, but maybe raised a few eyebrows. To some, updating this game with more content seemed a waste - why bother spending time on adding things to a game whose graphics could easily be dismissed as much too old for the current era?\n\nAnd yet, Dawn of War remains timeless, and so does this expansion. A sprawling campaign, active online community (even now, in a time of "superior" graphics and smoother gameplay), and a well thought-out set of mechanics that ensured every race had their advantages and disadvantages, some canceling each other out, others complementing each other, to create a blend of nine staggeringly complex races.\n\nThe learning curve of some races is high, and low for some others. There's something in this game for anyone who's even thought about playing an RTS. Mastering a race is, in itself, a reward. And a set of over a hundred maps, ranging from tiny two-person maps to sprawling eight-person arenas, will only add to the experience of doing so.\n\nOverall, 10/10. Solid soundtrack as always, decent enough graphics (they were ahead for their time when the first game was released) without taking too much of a toll on your system, eye-opening variation in mechanics for all nine races.","May 7, 2015","true","18.4"," 52 of 53 people (98%) found this review helpful","98","52","53","0","0"

The campaign is good, there is many races and the AI is really challenging on insane. With mods this game shines like gold (especially the Ultimate Apocalypse mod which I really recommend). The gameplay itself is smooth and well done-each unit is important, 1 building, 1 research, 1 Commander can change the tide of battle but you're gonna need a really strong processor for it if you wanna run the game with hundreds of units on the field, otherwise you will get command lag. The game's graphics are great for a game engine that came out in 2004 (you can even use SweetFX, ENB or other stuff like that to improve it even further). I didn't even mentoin that you can improve the game's graphics and detail on units just by typing some simple commands in the Local.ini and the game starts looking SO GOOD.

I was always kind of interested in 40K, having roomates who played the tabletop when I was younger and reading the odd comic here and there, but THIS was the game that turned me into a 40K fanboy and opened me up to the whole universe.\n\nNow before I go any further, if you want the definitive version of Dawn of War for its best balance in both mutliplayer and a better designed single player campaign then buy Dark Crusade. It was the pinnacle of the series.\nThere are two reasons why I play Soulstorm more than Dark Crusade, the first is that the multiplayer community seems to be much more active on SS than it is on DC, the second and infinitely more important reason is what the games community simply refers to by two letters......UA.\n\nThe "Ultimate Apocalypse" mod for Soul Storm or "UA" for short, has become the absolute best Warhammer 40k game ever made.\n\nThe following are just the things that I personally like about the mod, but doesn't even tip the iceburg for what it encompasses :\n-expands the maps and removes level caps so the truly epic 40K battles can expand in scope\n-introduces new races including Inquisition, Chaos Daemons, Tyranids and more...\n-introduced tons of new untis for exsiting races\n-new buildings, superweapons and tech trees to explore for all races\n-better balancing than vanilla for multiplayer\n-constant updates and new content all the time\nand of course......\nTITANS!!!!\n\nThe only thing I can hope for (because lets not kid ourselves, Relic is working on DoW 3) is that they make the next game much more like UA in design and get away from the smaller tactical stuff they did with DoW 2.\n\nAll in all this is my favorite game of all time and the first and to date ONLY time I will score a game with a perfect 10/10.\n\nBravo Relic and the UA team,  everyone's got a fave....and you made mine.","February 27","true","260.7"," 37 of 39 people (95%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","95","37","39","4","0"

(Steamworks)\n(Single player review) Every species and faction from the previous Dawn of War main game + Expansions, with two new factions and a campaign that is almost a copy of Dark Crusade. Which is a good thing, considering how much fun Dark Crusade was with the added burden of choices and a persistent battlefield.\nThe two new factions possess enough uniqueness to make them viable alternatives to the series mainstays. I've personally come to prefer the Sisters of Battle over Chaos due to the Sister's faith mechanic, where faith serves as a resource for various units to use for healing and attack bonuses in addition to whatever normal abilities the units possess. The Sisters also have a much greater reliance on melee and flame-based weapons compared to many of the other factions. I personally have no interest in the Dark Eldar, but the new faction's soul-harvesting mechanic dosen't sound like anything the other factions have.\nMy only real complaint agianst Soulstorm is that the additions to the single player campain seem poorly planed. Firstly, there's very little in the way of additions from Dark Crusade, but this isn't automatically a bad thing. What is troublesome, however, is that the main change, a move from a single planet battlefield to multiple, dosen't allow for zoom or any perspective changes. This means you may encounter difficulty seeing areas of the main battle map, where you view your territories and the territories of your enemies, at higher resolutions. Some tactical planning may be hampered by this, but this is not a large complaint.\nIf you have any interest in 40k, or if you are tired of Dark Crusade, or even if you just want to see a mostly-female (not all female, for some reason) human faction (I can't tell when it comes to the Eldar, but I guess they're female, too), pick up this game.  You don't need the other Dawn of War 1 games unless you really like space marine (Dawn of War base game) or Imperial Guard (Winter Assualt) plotlines. You will need the other games to unlock the other factions in multiplayer (already have all factions unlocked for any and all single player aspects).\nGameplay:\nhttp://youtu.be/8n8BdzaOKio","January 6, 2014","true","21.4"," 23 of 25 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","23","25","0","2"

The new commanders, their writing and voice acting is horrible compared to Dark Crusade. I mean the Necron Lord not only *talks* (whereas in DC, the talking was done cleverly by a humanoid hybrid Pariah, the other Necron units remaining almost always silent), he talks like he's got lung cancer. The Space Marines' Boreale lacked so much charisma that they had him canonically killed off after this game. All the other new commanders are basically just copied but worse versions of their Dark Crusade equivalents. The only two exceptions are - the Imperial Guard commander, Vance Stubbs, who's still worse than Alexander from Dark Crusade (especially in terms of voice acting), but at least he's got some character of his own - and the Ork commander, Warboss Gorgutz, because he's the only one returning from Dark Crusade.\n\nBut even writing/character/likability/voice acting aside, the campaign is worse in gameplay aspects as well. For some reason, the developers felt the need to "rebalance" the gameplay portion of the campaign, even though it's single player only. That means that everything got toned down - almost all of the Commanders' best upgrades got nerfed. As if that wasn't enough, defense missions are also extremely painful now. Why? Because in Dark Crusade, all sturctures that you've built in a mission would remain on the map the next time you play. That was mostly to compensate for the fact that you don't start out with your Commander/Honor Guard as you would normally when attacking. In Soulstorm, they removed that, so every single time, all the structures you've built magically disappear from the map after you win. Having to play the same two-three maps over and over and over again on the enemy's turn when he's attacking you, always starting from just your HQ and your stationed units there is incredibly boring and time consuming. And to top it all off, they also nerfed the bonuses you get - there are no longer any specials "out there" on the map for you to get, only Honor Guard. Some tiny production bonuses are also scattered around the map, but they're not even worth the time, really. Instead, every faction starts with its own special bonus that the others get after conquering their HQ. That sounds like nice balance on paper, but it's not really, since many of the factions start with useless arbirtrary stuff (Tau, Necrons), absolutely worthless stuff (Chaos), while the downright overpowered specials, of course, belong to the Eldar and the Sisters of Battle.\n\nOverall, a good game for what it is, and if you want to play the multiplayer, but if you're looking for a nice single player campaign experience, I'd recommend Dark Crusade instead.","February 14","false","39.6"," 31 of 45 people (69%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","69","31","45","9","4"

Most people think Dark Crusade was more balanced and was a overall better release, but I think that Soulstorm was far better designed (in terms of balance and replayability), though greatly flawed on release. In Dark Crusade, there was extremely heavy bias towards Tau and Necrons (being a Tau player myself), and unforgiving brutality to Imperial Guard players due to being extremely underpowered, though it was nice for the planet to stay persistant with what happened on it.(I.e, you defeat an ork encampment and establish a massive Eldar base, if that is then attacked, you will be returned to your base EXACTLY as you built it to retaliate).\n\nIn Soulstorm, everything (faction-wise) is perfected. It had horrific problems running on release, it's annoying that your base is basically cast aside at the end of a mission, meaning that if you are attacked you have to build your base from scratch (unless you invest funds) and the addition of flying units is a bit odd, but most (if not all) Tau units have been nerfed, as they should be, and all necron units were also nerfed. Subsequently, all Imperial Guard units were also buffed, providing an equal battleground for all of the (now) 9 factions in Soulstorm. Apart from Dark Eldar, they're like the new Imperial Guard.\n\nBut who wants to play as space emos?\n\nIf you're more into the lore and fluff of the universe, (and cringe when you see a space marine get cut down by a single guardsman), and would rather play something thats a little more faithful to the factions, I'd recommend DoW II and its expansions. It sacrifices strategic scale battles and faction choice in favour of tactical scale battles and realism (in terms of the 40k universe).","November 15, 2015","true","21.2"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","5"

The huge range of units and races:\nOk so most RTS games will default to 3 or 4 factions, this one however (as long as you have all the other expansions and core game) gives you up to 9 playable races. and its not like their all similar either, each race is completely unique and different.\n\n2. no rule restrictions:\nSo some RTS games I have recently had a look at will limit rules, for instance you cannot set your own teams, map position etc. This has a wide range of rules you can change to your way of playing.\n\n3. The huge ammount of maps:\nI have looked at some of the new RTS games, and one thing that turns me off is the map selection. They will have about 10-20 maps, usually with 1 map being an 8 player (if they even have 8 players allowed) this game however has over 100 maps! With both even maps for competitive matches or more unfair maps for free for alls, 2v2v2's 2v2v2v2's etc.\n\n4. The game play is both fun to watch, and very competitive (suits any style of play)\nEven after 4+ years of playing this game, I still learn new things, tactics, this game is very balanced, and there is no issue of players spamming mass of units to win.\n\nIf you do get this game and enjoy it, I strongly reccomend you download the supermod 'Ultimate Apocalypse mod' The latest version is 'The Hunt Begins'\nHere is a link to the group if you were interested: https://steamcommunity.com/groups/uamg","September 26, 2015","true","259.6"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","1"

Soulstorm is an extremely moddable game just like Dawn of War and the other expansions and that adds to the replayability of this game. If you ever get bored playing it, with just a few time and dedication you can change the game into something quite different, thus providing you with even more fun play time.","October 7, 2014","true","90.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

There is the addition of flying units, though I have only found the Space Marine flyer to be of any real use, the others are pretty much a waste.  The two new races are the Sisters of Battle, whose tanks suck but have strong and relatively cheap infantry. I didn't think they have strong heavy weapons teams though. The other new race is the Dark Eldar, who are supposed to be fast, but individual units are weak and they don't seem to have a vehicle that get stompy Except for their Robo-Scorpion thing, which looks like it should belong to Chaos or Necrons, but it is a very solid smasher, and three of them will wreck most bases by themselves.\n\nI wish they would make more of these Dawn of War games rather than the small unit focused sequel.

First off, the game has a lot of issues with loading, particularly with the campaign. Though I'll readily admit that my computer isn't a good one, the general concensus is that no game should keep you waiting as long as the Soulstorm Campaign does, so have a book or handheld system by your side if you intend to play the campaign. Secondly, as I'm sure a good chunk of you know, most of the voice acting for the Campaign mode is absolutely terrible, but this isn't a major issue as much as it is a gripe (most of the issues regarding the game come from the campaign).\n\nNow, on to the postives.\n\nThis expansion adds two new factions to play as, the Sisters of Battle and Dark Eldar, both of which are welcome additions to the game. Both bring new strategies to the table, as well as giving you a better look at the 40k universe (I say this because Dawn of War is most people's gateway to Warhammer 40,000). The gameplay is still solid (though of course balance is still a major issue), because few expansion packs can really mess up gameplay.\n\nAnd last but not least, the real reason you should purchase this game: The mods.\n\nThere are dozens of amazing mods for Soulstorm, from ambitious gameplay overhauls like Titanium Wars and Ultimate Apocalypse, to new factions (complete with voice acting) like the Armageddon Steel Legion and Tyranids. If you're not sure about getting Soulstorm, do it for the mods.","March 24, 2015","true","146.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The difference? Instead of just being a landmass, the battle map is an ENTIRE DAMN SOLAR SYSTEM.\n\nThe Expansion also adds two new Factions. Namely the Dark Eldar (Fallen Eldar slavers) and the SIsters of battles (Space Nuns with power armour). Both of these new factions have their quirks, with the Dark Eldar gaining a reasource for their special abilites from haresting their foes Corpses, and the Sisters Gaining both power and faith the more of a specific building you have.\n\nHowever, removeing those new races the expansion is basicly the same as dark crusade but with two new races and over many planets instead of just one. The game only has one other merit of note. That being the new unit's Voice work\nIT IS SO BAD AND I LOVE IT. As i mentioned at the start of this review, the Space Marine Boreale's voice actor has a bit of an accent with makes his speech so damn funny (Bhatal Bruvas, Spess Marhens, Steal Rein!).\n\nThe game also spawned Chaos Lord Carron, as-well his meme worthy response to the space marines use of Rhino armoured transports, below is a transcript.\n\n"Look!

Played Dark Crusade over years and Soulstorm is as good. But you have to like the 2 new races.\nThe balance is a bit off hand compared to StarCraft. But the matches are fast and intense and much fun and bring the sweat to your forehead. The Animations like the little finishing moves for every unit are great to the present day and blew my mind back in 2004. So the battles are bloody and ruthless as it should be for 40k game.\nAll in all: Relic did a great job in conveying the universe into a RTS game. Also are the online matches fast and intense and the 9 diffrent races bring a great variety and lots of strategies to experiment with. Sadly the balance is a bit off in online battles.\nStrongly recommended if you like RTS.","March 11, 2014","true","27.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It added 2 factions (Dark Eldar and Sisters of Battle) and 1 new unit for each race. The comparisons to Dark Crusade are inevitable so let's compare and contrast. Dark Crusade's persistant bases give you a reason to prolong a match so as to build up a good base for the next fight. Unfortunately, it also means that defenses can be insurmountable creating a World War 1 like stalemate. This was done away with in Soulstorm which created much shorter more offensive gameplay.\n\nOther complaints I have heard is in regards to the voice acting as opposed to Dark Crusade. Well, actually, this is true. There is significantly reduced dialogue in this one compared to Dark Crusade. Which is a genuine shame considering how much I enjoyed the back-and-forth of the two commanders as I assaulted a stronghold.\n\nWould I recommend it though? Short answer. Yes, just look at my time played. Of course this game is worth the money, and then some. If you need a great RTS or love Warhammer 40K, grab this game.

I had this game way before I had Steam, and I've probably spent 250+ hours on it.\n\nFor all you RTS junkies, THQ, Relic and Games Workshop created this.

The story might not be as thrilling or entertaining as other RTS games, but who plays RTS games for the cutscenes?\n\nDawn of War (all of them, but Soulstorm is more worth getting as it has all the races) is definitely the best RTS game i've played, bringing in new aspects of gaining resources and building armies that are absolutely great. Maps are awesome and designed very well, and the units and special abilities will satisfy you greatly. Dawn of War's races can vary very much, with some races such as the Necrons or Dark Eldar having special aspects that are completely alien compared to the other 7 races, so it has a good choice of the style of play that will keep you entertained for hours.\n\nAfter playing this game for long enough, you'll find yourself quoting the phrases the units say all the time.\n\nVery good game, must buy!","March 15, 2014","true","47.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","8"

That is a fact, opinions do not matter in the 40th millenia.\n\n- The ai is still kinda wonky on lower difficulties and will not always utilize their best features on higher ones. For example, the Eldar, who are meant to be a teleportation based army with weak hit-and-run style units, will instead opt for buildig multiple unupgraded guardian (rifleman) squads and rush you by the two minute mark. This works well if you didnt build a turret which mows them down violently, but it still doesn't fit with how that faction was meant to work. This can be fixed with mods however.\n\n-Due to age, and a community divided over mods, finding people to play with isn't always easy. If you have friends into RTS games however, this game is a god(emperor)send.\n\n-The new aerial units take a lot of damage from even basic infantry making them not very viable in many instances. So if your looking for some high end combined arms assault, all your gonna get is some quality infantry and armored vehicles fighting as dead pilots drop down.\n\n-The controversial commander units are back, though not as dangerous as they are in the second game as they are still very much killable by even the weaker units. In my opinion, they aren't too much of an issue and as a concept add to the game, though balance is a tad bit skewed as some armies get their primary and best commanders at the beginning like the Space/Chaos marines and dark eldar when others have to wait for a base upgrade or other enhancement. I feel that these guys have a bit too much early game infantry harassment but by the end is no issue.\n\n-A full-fleged story based campaign is still absent like in Dark Crusade but the new campaign format included in the two allows you to play as your favorite faction instead of either the Space marines in the base game, or 1-2 missions for each in the Winter Assault.\n\nIn conclusion, the game still holds up and is still fantastic to play in both standard and the Ultimate Apocalypse mod. Balance still isn't perfect, but the more you play you should be able to master and hold up as any faction making it one of the most biggest and greatest RTS games out there.","May 7","true","61.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Each of the races has a different feel and lends itself to different types of strategy and yet each race also has the ability to overcome its weaknesses.  This extension of DOW adds flying units (except Nekrons) and two new races, of which I have found the Sisters of Battle particuarly fun tio play.  The flying units are nice but not a real powerhouse of the game.  On the downside, the map is a tad less dynamic than DC--I feel its predecessor had more options in its pathing, but the races balance better in Soulstorm.  The difficulty levels also offer greatly different game experiences.  The campaign is nice for an extended play, especially if you change races it can be like a new game.  The skirmish mode also allows for some quick, fun play.  The AI is ok--you might find yourself able to begin overunning the map in campaign mode once you have won a few victories in a row at times.  Overall, I recommend this game for its replayability and various levels of alien color.","December 20, 2013","true","113.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

SoB's are like the Space Marines but they have a lot more special abilities, especially with their Faith rescource. Some of their abilities are veeeeeeery nice. The Dark Eldar are also extremely fun, and they have a special resource too, Soul Essence. The Dark Eldar use theirs differently (its on a toolbar, rather than the SoB's being on units), and they actually have some useful, if not a little overpowered, abilities.\n\nYou can also now place turrets anywhere in open territory, which is pretty nice for setting up things like checkpoints, bottlenecks and kill zones, especially when using the IG (Imperial Guard) and their heavy weapon squads in tandem with the turrets.\n\nThe campaign runs differently as well. Instead of one planet, you fight over 4 planets, with webgates transferring between planets. Without them, you cannot transfer to any other planet other than your starting one (Unless you're Dark Eldar, as they get an ability to travel to ANY gate). You get your Honour Guard, and you get your garrisons as well. AND, each race has their own abilities, such as the T'au having a cannon that damages the defending area, or the Chaos Space Marines who ignore broken supply lines.\n\nWhat's better, they run their servers off their Company of Heroes servers since Gamespy tried to money-grab off them, and the new MP is pretty sleek and pretty. Odd lag spike but that always happens in any game. Overall, 8/10.","July 17, 2014","true","42.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Each of the races has a different feel and lends itself to different types of strategy and yet each race also has the ability to overcome its weaknesses.  This extension of DOW adds flying units (except Nekrons) and two new races, of which I have found the Sisters of Battle particuarly fun tio play.  The flying units are nice but not a real powerhouse of the game.  On the downside, the map is a tad less dynamic than DC--I feel its predecessor had more options in its pathing, but the races balance better in Soulstorm.  The difficulty levels also offer greatly different game experiences.  The campaign is nice for an extended play, especially if you change races it can be like a new game.  The skirmish mode also allows for some quick, fun play.  The AI is ok--you might find yourself able to begin overunning the map in campaign mode once you have won a few victories in a row at times.  Overall, I recommend this game for its replayability and various levels of alien color.","December 20, 2013","true","113.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is a problem that is easily fixed as there are many mods available for this game which make it much closer to the Warhammer 40K codexes in terms of the units available and the options each unit can take.","June 26, 2015","true","21.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mkLarva/recommended/9450/","mkLarva","mkLarva","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mkLarva/","115 products in account","A must have for RTS fans and hardcore players alike!\n\nWhen it comes to Real Time Strategy games this is by far my favorite and in my opinion the best out there, the Grand maître of modern RTS, and no, I'm not saying this because I'm a WH40k fan, in fact, this game is what introduced me to the epic universe of WarHammer, and since then other RTS games always feel lacking in comparision. I must mention that as much as DoW is my favorite RTS, I am not fond at all with DoW2 as an RTS (nor do I consider it one), even if the SP and COOP campaigns are really enjoyable to play.\n\nPros (Jeez, where to start!):\n\n- The most diverse strategy options: 9 'Races', and i put it in quotation because this is a Lore argument. but you have the option to choose from 9 different sides each with their own unique treats and perks, advantages and weaknesses. The squad/cap system is incredible, offering more rewarding complexity should you choose to micro manage things, or a more sustainable "send and forget" tactics. Whether you're playing alone, in teams or Battle Royal, whether you prefer strategic tactical ops or battlefield domination, the game will not get borning any time soon.\n\n- Phenominal voice-casting that will be unforgettable, adding so much to the ambience of the battles. An excellent game engine that aged very well. It's been over 10 years, and this game still looks and feels delicious, with possible modding to bring out even more from a still active and involved community.\n\n- Lore of such scale and detail that would drawf even Tolkien's work (LotR). This is a universe that's been alive and vibrant for DECADES, and it shows no sign of fainting or faltering. And who knows, maybe if you're lucky enough this game will be a gateway to the original tabletop game which is the most established tt aside of the infamous D&D.\n\n\n\nCons:\n- It used to have a LAN and IP option, removed by Sega to force people to play on their servers. If you find this game elsewhere online chances are those options are still there.\n\n- Can be a bit overwhelming at first, especially with so many different enemies to learn how to fight against. One you get the combat concepts absorbed you'll find it easier to learn about individual\n\n- The SP campaign can be rather "Risk" like, which can get a little borning and griding for those expecting to see interactive story telling like in StarCraft or C&C. I can understand that, since there are 9 playable races, it's hard to script individual story campaigns for everything. Still each race has a unique "final mission" and once you get the hang of it, quickly defeating enemies will get easier and easier for you.\n\n- Vanilla AI is somewhat lacking, but Dawn of Skirmish AI mod fixes that and ads a bunch of new features that will increase the replay value for you.\n\n- A veteran online community: after a decade of playing the game, you'll find that more often than not, you're gonna run into really good players in online MP. The best way to practice is to start 1v1 against AI, then get a buddy to 2v2 against AI, then play against your buddy, then try your luck online.\n\n","February 3","true","319.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It happened to me as well, and Warhammer 40 000 is still my favorite "commercial" fantasy world. It seems unreal yet plausible, like a funny nightmare perhaps. Relic has captured the spirit of 40K perfectly, and the games are great on their own as well. This is the fourth and final part of Dawn of War 1, and Relic gave the design duties to Iron Lore. It shows, for the campaign is an inferior repetition of Dark Crusade, and the writing is generic at best. Yet the original gameplay is beyond all criticism, and the two new armies are realized very well. There are a total of nine factions, and all are worth attention and playtime. Iron Lore folded and Soulstorm patch cycle stopped. There is a Maktaka Bugfix Mod, which is absolutely essential. It should work with Steam as well.","July 26, 2013","true","0.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You do have to buy all 4 games to get all of the races, and I get it, that is annoying. However, the modding community for this game is great, and there is one in particular that I would like to talk about. Ultimate Apcolypse mod is a fan made mod that adds the Tryanids, better game settings, (it also has a map pack that increases the zoom distance and increases visibility when you zoom out) it is still getting updated, recently there had been 2 more custom races added: The Inquisition with the totally badass Grey Knights (know as Daemonhunters in game), and Chaos Daemons, not to forget the improvements on all other races with new units and textures/models. The creators of the mod are great at what they've done and I think that they are one of the main reasons why I love Warhammer so much, so props to them. If you want the mod, here is a link to their download page (virus free btw):\n\nhttp://www.moddb.com/mods/ultimate-apocalypse-mod/downloads\n\nPlease note that the game still has desync and desync errors, and it requires a more resources to not have lag. (however if you have it set so that you have massive battles with a population cap over 100, you will probably get at bit of lag, especially since the mod is basically a massive overhaul of the original. The mod itself is more than 2GB, but it is really worth it, trust me.","June 5, 2015","true","208.3"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Typically, your average RTS is either a survival game where you build up forces to withstand assault or it's a level-by-level progression, where you complete sequential missions.  This was the first time I actually felt like I was playing both at once.  The campaign mode of this game is odd, but in a good way; it's a refreshing way to bridge the two different styles of RTS into a unique gameplay system.\n\nAnother interesting mechanic is the different races in the game.  Usually, different races will have a general build order that all follow the same way, or there are a few radically different races.  With this game, each race has a unique build style to explore!  The Imperial Guard have garrisonable buildings, the Eldar can Teleport, the Battle Sisters have Holy Relics... it's like each race is it's own unique game!\n\n(P.S.: If you're a bigtime RTS player like I am, and you're just now getting into this game, then I recommend starting as the Tau when you first play this game; their build order is more familiar to folks coming from a Starcraft or CiV background.)\n\nThe only downside to this "expansion"/game, I would say, is the lack of a story.  I mean, there is one, but it's very underplayed in this expansion.  It takes a bit of RP to really get into the story; not like Winter Assault or Dark Crusade, where there's a very obvious storyline to follow.  Still, this isn't really a big issue with the game itself; if you're already a big 40K fan, then you might not even notice it at all.\n\nAll in all, a wonderful spin on the RTS games.  9/10.  Looking to get the other DoW1 titles, to experience the other stories in this game series.","June 5","true","56.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The gameplay is both really good and really terrible.\n\nWhat makes it good is the diversity available - this is the first strategy game I've ever played that has a staggering count of NINE playable races, but what counters that is that they're all extremely complex and hard to understand. The actual gameplay of resource points and what not, though, is kind of puzzling, and I would have honestly preferred to just stay with the traditional resource gathering. In many ways, it sort of reminds me of Tiberian Twilight; the less said about that game the better.\n\nSo since Steam forces me with a "black or white" option with "yes or no", I'll recommend this game with a "yes", though it's probably not for everybody.","June 5","true","1.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Enjoy playing a game that has virtually no balance problems. Enjoy playing a game with 9 different races that somehow all play the same, something that Starcraft 2 Heart of The Swarm currently is beginning to fail at.\n\nEnjoy playing a game where each race has a super weapon that is literally a giant unit from a giant tank, to a large, fat pyramid-ish cube with a giant laser beam, or even a big pig...thing with lasers on it's head, bigger than the swimming pool you went to last month.\n\nTrust me... these Super Weapons put Command and Conquer's Super Weapons at the kiddie table, they make them look like pea shooters almost. Oh... what's that? One is an energy field that makes all tanks and vehicles invulnerable for a short time? One of them is an ion blast fired from a sattelite in space or something? One of them is a nuke?\n\nOnly the Nuke super weapon stands up to any of these.\n\nThe game works off of unlimited resources known as Requisition and Power. Power, you make generators to make, and Requisition is gained from taking and holding points throughout a map. Both can be upgraded in a different way to produce more resources faster.\n\nAnyonewho is a fan of strategy games who has NOT played this one is just simply missing out.\n\nThis game is the closest anyone will ever get to a seemingly perfect game in it's own rights, and to add to it, it's got wonderful voiceacting, awesome soundtracks and rather impressive visuals for it's time, all of which stands just aswell today.\n\nHardcore RTS fans can agree that if you are a HUGE fan of the Real-Time Strategy Game, you owe it to yourself to try this.\n\nThe game has 3 expansions, the first one adds The Imperial Gaurd, the second adds the Tau and Necrons, and the thirds adds the Sisters of Battle and the Dark Eldar.\n\nAll 3 add onto the game and simply make it one of the best if not the best RTS in existence so far.\n\nAlso only Soulstorm has much of an actual multiplayer, because people only play it, so if multiplayer is what you're looking for... well try out the skirmish mode, and if you like this, get the 3 expansions and join us in the crusade to kill eachother!\n\nThis game is easily an 8/10, it's simply gaming bliss.","July 20, 2014","true","44.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You can no longer keep buildings in areas you conquered like the last game, unless  you have the foward basses ability. you can steal abilities off other races when you defeat them which gives you great boons and in this one two new groups appear. The sisters of combat and the Dark Eldar. This makes it a huge campaign and a lot of choice for people who want to play multiplayer and more fun than Dark Crusade.","September 18, 2012","true","30.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Overall hours played if I count the time before I finally decided to re-purchase it via Steam is about 1.5k hours as this was the most played strategy game in my collection back in the day.\n\nVanilla Review:\n\nDawn of War Soulstorm has many, many unfinished abilities and units which take away from the overall effect of multiplayer and campaign abilities. While in itself it is still a good title and a replayable campaign for AI grinding is still fun, if Relic/THQ had actually finished their project, it would of been a lot better.\n\nThe Campaign is basically a repeat of Dark Crusade but you got Tau and Sisters of Battle now which isn't really that much. Overall balancing is okay but there is a lot left to be desired such as knockback spam being hard to counter or defend against and special weapons troopers always being the first to die even if they're in the back of the squad being attacked.\n\nThe vanilla version also does a very poor job at vehicle implementation particularly with aircraft as they're glorified glass cannons in some cases (Orks) and useless in almsot all accords (Imperial Guard).  Limiting special units in most cases where in Dark Crusade you could have more is a double edged sword and the limits should of been raised. Having the ability to only create one elite troop unit compared to three back in Dark Crusade is a major debuff in my opinion and overall takes away from the fighting experience as most of them are very weak to begin with.\n\nThe developers have also neglected balancing between every race. Races such as the Orks and Tau are extremely powerful against most other factions and in some cases you can't even win if it's against a competent player or the AI on the highest difficulty such as Orks vs Imperial Guard....you can't even win in a balanced fight particularly if it's 3v3 or 4v4 due to the Invulnerability spam on Ork units. Now if you do Orks vs Space Marines or even Eldar, it's a lot easier because the races aren't glass cannons. Imperial Guard it seems has been mostly balanced from a 1v1 stand point and team fight with non-Imperial Guard races which is a shame because they should be able to do well in team fights with other Guard players but in almost every instance, that is not the case. Sisters of Battle are extremely strong in all stages of the game and honestly minus the fact they're basically infantry only, can beat almost every faction in a 1v2 instance. Tau are glorified glass cannons and with the length of their tech tree, most games end before you can even begin to put the hurt on the enemy in a 1v1. Their entire tech tree is based off long team fights where they really shine and often end up losing in early game fights on small maps due to their higher maintenance costs and the lack of defenses. Eldar/Dark Eldar and SM/CSM have changed very little and are good at all stages, no reall balancing needed. Necrons, very very good late stages but absolutely get massacured early game in even fights. Not even balanced in a 1v1 perspective or even 2v2, they show the least amount of balancing from the developers and honestly only shine on large maps where you can't get rushed at one minute into the game.\n\n\nOverall Score: 7/10\nCampaign 5/10\nMultiplayer 8/10\nGame Mechanics 8/10\nReplay Value 10/10\nBalacning 6/10\n\nUltimate Apocalypse Review:\n\nThis is the way the game should be played IF your computer is capable of supporting it. It expands upon the vanilla build and releases several more functions that make the game more enjoyable in addition to implementing several functions that were left unfinished such as additional units and abilities.\n\nThe mod also implements the Tyranids and Inquisition (WIP) for play in addition to a few new maps but overall is a massive rebalancing project that is catered as well towards Super Heavy battles. Trust me, if you want a tank war, this is the mod for you especially if you play Imperial Guard. It embraces the doctrine of "We have a tank for that too!"\n\nThe ability for all races to now build defensive turrets and in some cases walls/barricades is an added bonus on smaller maps to help prevent rushing and the ability to further upgrade defensive buildings and resources helps solve the problem of resource stagnation in most games making it much easier to continue playing late game even if you end up losing your armies rapidly.\n\nThe mod also rebalances aircraft which in the Vanilla version were a joke and a waste of resources. In addition to the mod expanding both the capabilities of each race, it also drastically increases the scale of destruction and carnage you can witness. The mod is still a WIP which is good because it is constantly rebalanced and a few new races are being implemented.\n\nUltimate Apoclaypse Link: http://www.moddb.com/mods/ultimate-apocalypse-mod\n\nOverall Score 9/10\nBalancing 8/10\nGame Mechanics 10/10\nCampaign 10/10\nReplay Value 10/10\nMultiplayer 9/10","October 20, 2014","true","50.9"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

And by better I mean breasts.\n\nIt's not just mammaries, though: this standalone expansion also adds a new, very bad campaign, as if to send the message that women ruin everything. Gazongas + misogynism isn't really a groundbreaking theme in video games, but it's an underrepresented one in the RTS genre, so Soulstorm really fills a void that has really only been addressed by the Red Alert series.

The lack of micro managing 'villagers/workers' to harvest resources keep you focused on the fight more often, and your resources are based off capturing specific locations scattered on the map. The fundamentals : squad based units, access to iconic units and vehicles, nice visuals, and an interesting take on unit upgrades. If you enjoy this game you'll like Dawn of war Dark crusade aswell, being nearly identical only lacking the dark eldar race and the Sisters of battle. No big loss really...\nYou might also check out the Titanium wars mod, for both soulstorm and dark crusade.\n\nFor a warhammer fan or an RTS fan, a must buy.\n","September 3, 2014","true","215.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

No Necrons, Imperial Guard or Tau, on multiplayer, even if you already bought those games which still advertise this as a selling point.\n\nUnless this is a problem, if single player campaigns with medium stories is your thing (note all races are allowed in offline v cpu skrimish), highly recommended.\n\nIf you like multiplayer, coop or otherwise, avoid until the developers or the forces that be resolve what is a damn annoying bug.\n\nWriting this as a negative review, was hard.

The races are slightly imbalanced, however, on a big map with four plus players, this game becomes more intense as a strategy than any fast paced shooter. You micromanage like crazy, biuld units, attack, retreat ,upgrade , capture, hold, lose, take back, scout, use abilities (a mind blowing amount of them too)... And then an epic battle happens with giant Relic units and dozens of different troops and troop types. Even though DoW2 is better in physics and engine and etc. it does not have the same drive as this game... Speaking of Single player, Dark Crusade is probably the best, however for more in-depth experience I prefer the winter assault, although it is more linear.","September 12, 2012","true","41.8"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","8"

It offers the most balance, though it's still one of the less balanced RTS games, and it has the most races.\n\nThe Warhammer 40K really comes to live in this game, with memorable quotes from units and mouth-watering visuals as lasers and rockets fly. Units have special kill animations during battles in melee, making them visually impressive whether you're zoomed out or zoomed in. Each of the many factions plays very differently, from the Orks and their unit-swarming powers to the Necrons and their utterly free, but slow, units.\n\nThere's a replayable campaign in Soulstorm, similar to the one offered in Dark Crusade, but most players will find their playtime in skirmishes and online. I highly reccomend playing with friends if you aren't competitive. Also of note, Soulstorm has a very impressive free mod named Codex that adds -a ton- of variety and also has options to increase the population limits on battles, allowing giant wars worthy of the Warhammer name. This mod is well worth looking into once you're done with the vanilla game.\n","September 8, 2014","true","14.5"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

However, instead of a last hurrah in honour of the glorious emperor of mindkind, it just a convoluted mess of gimmicks and glitches.\n\nBefore we discuss the technicalities, lets look at the content. Soulstorm adds two new races to Dawn of War: The Sisters of Battle, and the Dark Eldar. Neither are genuinely unique races, but they are different from the race their branched out of. The Sisters are a cult of fanatics who wield a wide assortment of flamethrowers and use divine powers to make themselves invincible. The Dark Eldar on the other hand are all about speed and hit and run tactics. Each race also gets a new airplane unit which reflects the race's general playstyle. Both of the new races also come with their own unique resource that can be spent to unleash special abilities on the field.\nBoth races feel rather uninteresting. The Sisters feel space marines without the brawn, while the Dark Eldar feel like a swarm of gnats that cannot really put out any damage.\n\nUnfortunately, the problems have only just begun. The expansion is unfinished; many abilities and weapons just don't do anything. The guns on some aircraft really do no damage, while other abilities just stack ad infinitum to create an indestructible unit. It is a shame, because the campaign tries to go above and beyond what Dark Crusade had set up. More planets, more abilities, more options. However, just like I mentioned before, a lot of it just doesn't work properly.\n\nTo be fair, Soulstorm's development was a mess and as a result the final product is a mess. It functions, but only barely. Playing Soulstorm is like driving a Ferrari with its tyres deflated; You may have the best car in the world, but you just can't enjoy it to the fullest because there is a glaring fault wherever, and whatever you do.","February 19, 2014","false","33.1"," 32 of 72 people (44%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","44","32","72","4","2"

It's a standalone expansion to Dawn of War that adds two new races and using the new non-linear Grand Strategy style campaign map that THQ have grown so fond of.\n\nLike in Dark Crusade there is really no learning curve for new players. You are thrown directly into the fray with no introduction to the gameplay, units or technologies and just have to wing it as best you can. Also like in Dark Crusade you can only use the new races in multi-player unless you already own the previous Dawn of War games which is really a bummer for anyone that buys this with the intention to play with friends.\n\nThe single-player is the continued development of Dark Crusade and the campaign works much the same way. The introduction of two new factions have made the map a bit bigger and this doesn't help as it only adds more grind. Playing through the single-player is essentially a progression of skirmish maps and it becomes boring, very fast. The stronghold maps are quite entertaining but they are the only fun thing in the campaign so you'll often find yourself dreading going into battle against yet another pointless incursion into your territory.\n\nThe new factions introduced in Soulstorm aren't quite as interesting as the ones introduced in Dark Crusade either. Firstly you have the Sisters of Battle which are essentially the super fanatical military arm of the "Ordo Hereticus" in the Empire of Man. Essentially they are the people you send when it's time to massacre your own people in great numbers. They have no remorse and will willing sacrifice anyone in the name of the Emperor. In game they play much like the Space Marines, in fact they are eerily similar in terms of unit composition to the regular Space Marines, only with a somewhat disturbing tendency towards pyromania.\n\nThe second new faction are the Dark Eldar which are what the Chaos Space Marines to the Eldar. Unfortunately they are not nearly as cool or as interesting. They feel like some Eldar went and smoked some Chaos but forgot to inhale. In terms of gameplay they are little more interesting than the Sisters of Battle with their fast moving units but they don't really add too much to the formula.\n\nBoth factions read really well in the WH40K universe but their implementation in the Dawn of War franchise feels really poor. They just lose so much of their personality when they don't have any proper campaigns, you never feel the fanaticism of the sisters or the sadomasochism of the Dark Eldar.\n\nSound and graphics are solid as always but as nothing new is being added it's beginning to feel a little stale.\n\nAlthough this installment maintains that special WH40K feel that I enjoy so much it, much like the rest of the game, has begun to feel a little stale. No new story or interesting characters have been introduced since Winter Assault and there really isn't much left.\n\nSoulstorm feels like a last attempt at squeaking out the last bit of money from Dawn of War before THQ moves on to making a proper sequel.","November 12, 2012","false","91.7"," 6 of 31 people (19%) found this review helpful","19","6","31","0","0"

Everytime you win a battle the entire map resets, meaning when you have to defend a province all the buildings, turrets, and defences you spent requisition on are gone and you have to start from scratch. Auto resolve destroys any defences you bought with global requisition and sets a province's defense score to one. So basically you're forced to play the same skirmish game over and over again so you don't lose all your stuff. The AI platently cheats, enemy units "just happen" to know where your invisible units are and their teliporters/jetpackers land on your units without any "eyes on target" with pin point accuracy.\nI would recommend this only for the new races (SoB ftw) and the ability to play as evey race from the previous games/DLC (provided you have those.)

And the stronghold mission against the Sisters of battle is an unreasonable pain in the ♥♥♥. Its not hard just annoying because you have to destroy three statues while fending of a near invunerable Monsterous creature.\n\nThat being said if you liked Dawn of War up to this point then this breaths in a few more hours of life into the game.","April 24, 2014","true","28.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Don't get me wrong, it's still a load of fun, but when compared to the other installments in the series, this one feels a bit phoned in.\n\nIf you've ever played Dark Crusade, it's very much like that.  But, in case you haven't, in Soulstorm you choose one of nine factions to lead to victory over the Kaurava system.  The system is divided into territories spanned across 4 planets and 3 moons.  Each faction starts controlling a certain number of territories, whereas the player starts with only a single territory.  Each faction must then battle it out for control of each territory in the system.  You defeat other factions by conquering their primary territory, known as their stronghold.\n\nIn Dark Crusade the campaign played out in much the same fashion, but over a single planet rather than a system.  Furthermore, the backstory for the planet and each of the individual territories felt much more fleshed out in Dark Crusade.  The reasoning for the presence of each faction was better explained and the entire game just seemd to have more personality.\n\nAside from this, Soulstorm is really just more of the same.  And that's great if you're a Dawn of War fan.  It's great to finally see the Adepta Sororitas (Sisters of Battle) added to the game and the gameplay works just as well as it ever has.\n\nUltimately, I would recommend this game but only if you enjoyed the other Dawn of War installments.  If this is your first introduction to the Dawn of War Series, I would strongly recommend playing the other games first.","December 21, 2014","true","18.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But if I take a the difficulty a step down it works fine.\n\nThat's my only fuss, still a great game. 9/10.\n\nIf anyone is interested in this game and gets into it a lot, I'd recommend the Ultimate Apocalypse mod for Soulstorm.

The Campaign is set across four worlds with a huge variation of terrains. The gameplay is very fun and it is still challenging for someone who's been playing this game for many years. For a Warhammer 40K fan there's little I find more exciting than running my 40K army at another army. This game adds two new armies, the Dark Eldar and the Sisters of Battle. The Dark Eldar are most likely my favourite race (This is the army I collect) and I feel they add a good new gameplay option with the collection of souls. The Sisters of Battle aren't really my cup of tea, but hey can be very difficult to defeat. I highly recommend thi game to any 40K fans or anyone else who likes creating a awesome army. I would also recommend downloading the Ultimate Apocalypse mod from this link http://www.moddb.com/mods/ultimate-apocalypse-mod as it creates massive epic battles with Titans! Thanks for reading!

Preferrably with all of the other expansions.\nThis is a real-time strategy game. Not a big game of rock-paper-scissors (ala C&C, which I do love as well), or who-can-make-the-most-the-fastest (ala Starcraft, less love but more hours in my younger days).\nThe campaigns are pretty good. I especially enjoyed Winter Assualt, despite it being very short. Call me a sucker for hopeless military stories. Soulstorm is better, though. It plays like a board game, taking over the planet, battling other factions. You win a battle, you take some land and get bonuses later. You lose, you wait until the next turn and plan your next move. Then move in and play what I think (because this is a review) is the best RTS experience since...well, nothing else I've played really matches it.\nDespite the huge number of different armies availible with all expansions, everything is pretty well balanced. Everything caters to different players. How do a bunch of Orks beat a bunch of Space Marines, or a group of Tau beat some Eldar? You have to figure it out. The same thing doesn't work against everyone. And when you have an eight-player free-for-all, what do you do? Endless options, endless replayability.\n\nIt's the 41st Milenium and let's hope war indeed never changes.","December 18, 2013","true","24.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Each different army requires a different approach and strategy. The easiest to play are perhaps the Necron (just mass produce troops create a field of corpses then show up with your hero and resurrect the lot whilst producing a giant army). The variety of different armies is quite large (Eldars, Dark Eldars, Orcs, Space Marines, Chaos, Sisters of Battle, Necrons and the Imperial Guard), the graphics are decent (far from gorgeous, but the kind that never really gets old, the game remains playable and enjoyable several years later), the gameplay is interesting (this is a war RTS, so none of that gathering ressources crap: you need energy for your base and to occupy strategic points. The solo mod is fun (a map with planets, you zoom in for each battle), but the scenario is weak. For a really enjoyable scenario - not particularly original, but very entertaining - try the first Dawn of War. I did not play Winter Assault, but I hear that the campaign is good too. Anyway, I'm still playing it, and still lovin' it.

The only thing I'd fuss about is the AI, I like to try to just build a base and see how long I can hold out against a single max difficulty AI or multiple and it seems that the AI gets stuck on something. Several games I've played they just spawn the base (cultist, mandrakes, guardsmen, scouts, ect.) units over and over and over and not do anything with them really. But if I take a the difficulty a step down it works fine.\n\nThat's my only fuss, still a great game. 9/10.\n\nIf anyone is interested in this game and gets into it a lot, I'd recommend the Ultimate Apocalypse mod for Soulstorm. It's absolutely ♥♥♥♥ing awesome, any fan of Warhammer should download it and play it. Adds so much content, a ridiculous amount. Titans, Havocs, Stormblades, Lord of Change, Plague Barers, ect. a lot of things that make the game even more incredible. Not to mention super increased unit/vehicle cap for seriously epic battles.\n\nDawn of War: Soulstorm + Ultimate Apocalypse\n100/10, would definitely recommend.","January 1, 2015","true","26.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Adds two new races, a new story mode.  Of the two new races i find the Dark Eldar more intresting. The Sisters of battle are pretty similar to Space Marines but with a high focus on short range weapons.\n\nMy only two main gripes with the expansion are that the computer A.I. will often try to build smaller secondary bases when on the run making battles take too long.  And the stronghold mission against the Sisters of battle is an unreasonable pain in the ♥♥♥. Its not hard just annoying because you have to destroy three statues while fending of a near invunerable Monsterous creature.\n\nThat being said if you liked Dawn of War up to this point then this breaths in a few more hours of life into the game.","April 24, 2014","true","28.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Two new races, a campigan over an entire system, and unique new units. The problems regarding Soulstorm is the lack of balance, the amibitious story mode which felt lifeless with none of the banter that was displayed in Dark Crusade, nothing new in terms of multiplayer, and the wargear mode is just recycled stuff from Dark Crusade. Unless you play on Hard mode, Soulstorm is a somewhat of a breeze to beat ranging from 8-13 hours.

Had it on disc prior to owning it on steam, so I played it more than you think. The campaign is a bit lacking, with some bizarre voice acting here and there, but it does allow you to pick your favourite race and just go on a crusade (a dark crusade?) destroying everything else on every other planet in the game.\n\nThat's just single player though, the real gem is multiplayer for this game. Fantastic array of races means that you have a chance to make an 8 player game where everybody is a different race! Each one has a different build style and slightly different strategy so If you enjoy RTS and like feeling unique in a game then this is for you.\n","February 2, 2014","true","138.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Deimenried/recommended/9450/","Deimenried","Deimenried","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Deimenried/","240 products in account","Having very little experience of Warhammer 40,000 as a tabletop game, I am not going down the road of making any sort of analogy nor comparison. While it may be a strange idea to some, over the years I have had the constant barrage of "Oh, it's nothing like the tabletop game, you know." despite me not having claimed otherwise. Instead I will evaluate its merit as an RPG. I will note at this point that I have also played vanilla Dawn of War and the preceding expansions Winter Assault and Dark Crusade.\n\nOn first coming to this game I found it very easy to pick up. With most races simply having the two basic resources, requisition and power, it was easy enough to settle into the tempo of gameplay. Requisition is collected by taking and holding control points (so no messy resource gathering) and power by building generators anywhere you control. The races each have their own distinct styles of warfare, but when broken down to basics they all follow the same pattern with unit types consistent across all races, so understanding what to make when and how to attack/counterattack is simple. However, the technology trees make advancement slightly different, and tactics must be adapted. Some races have unique benefits and requirements, such as the Orks requiring you to fill the Waaaaaargh! meter to progressively increase the population cap and develop improvements, or the Dark Eldar who gain powers as they consume the souls of fallen enemy troops. The differences make gameplay refreshing when playing as or against the different races.\n\nThe battlefields themselves are well designed for balance (for skirmishes) or to challenge your leadership (for the campaign), with plenty of terrain variations that may help or hinder your troops advancement and survivability in a firefight. The environments too are well varied for visual and, to some extent, tactical enhancement with a healthy mix of wastelands, forests, swamps and cities from across the galaxy to whet your appetite. The campaign is reasonable, but not great, and sees you vying for control of a star system (I won't spoil it) against each of the other races. There are several tactical objectives that can even the odds before you invade a territory Risk-style should you take it. If you have played the Dark Crusade campaign then there's nothing much new with the cinematic-style endgame fights when you strike an enemy's capital, which are actually more structured scenarios than those of regular territory invasions, along with the obligatory cut-scenes.\n\nThere's a decent amount of customisation available throughout, with the in-built Army Painter allowing you to do virtually what would take hours of laborious armwork and make a mess of your room/shed/garage. It has to be said, there is a certain sense of accomplishment seeing your custom flag being raised as you capture a control point. What I do find to be absent is a map editor, so in that respect customisation is a tiny bit limited, and the skirmish maps are all pre-built with no randomisation beyond your starting position (which makes little difference on a symmetrical-ish map).\n\nFrom a graphics standpoint the game is presented very well, with plenty of satisfying and beefy explosions, eerily beautiful plasma bolts and las beams flying around (The Baneblade in particular is especially good at showing these off) and, depending on your particular chipsets (mine not being too spectacular at the minute), the game is easily one of the prettier RTSs around, even now. The AI is decent, although bumbling on easier settings, and should provide a challenge to every skillset.\n\nIn short;\n\nFOR : Simple to pick up, challenging to master. Custom armies. Good graphics, even by today's standards. Nice soundtrack.\nAGAINST : Limited customisation. Pre-built arenas. Not very engaging campaign (compared to previous iterations).\n\nOverall, despite its flaws, I would certainly reccomend you at least try this game. I find it to be enjoyable and quite addictive!","January 4, 2014","true","161.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Most likely the most ambitious, and fun DLC's for Dawn of War.\n\nBefore you buy this, BE SURE you have Dawn of War Gold Downloaded, or this won't be a very fun experience...\n\nSoulstorm brings in two new factions, a couple new maps, and a huge new Campaign mode.\n\nThe two new factions are lots of fun to play around with, as well the maps, but the best reason to get this DLC is for the Campaign.\n\nIn the Dark Crusade, you start with a small faction, and push your forces across a planet, without restriction! Which I found pretty fun. In Solulstorm, it is like Dark Crusade's campaign, but with multiple planets! I found the campaign mode lots of fun, as my Orks just pillaged, and took over worlds, from the Imperial Guard, Space Marines, Dark Eldar, etc.\n\nToo bad, this being the last DLC in the series, we never did get an OFFICIAL Tyranid faction, though we do have modders to thank for them.","July 23, 2015","true","19.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No better or worse than the Dark Crusade, just different. They added two more races but the campaign is like Dark Crusade: You try to take over all zones in a star system. Most of the maps are boring, and defending your areas multiple times per round can be tiresome. On Easy the AI is a joke, and from Medium upwards the AI is brutally efficient. Dark Eldar in particular have a bad habit of standing around doing nothing.\n\nHowever, theres plenty of options for Skirmish, and a LOT of maps. More than any previous version of the game. This will probably be your default program for multiplayer and AI single player, as it has all the factions and all the maps.\n\nBut if you want a solid campaign experience on any difficulty, you need to play the Gold edition.","May 26, 2014","true","152.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Preferrably with all of the other expansions.\nThis is a real-time strategy game. Not a big game of rock-paper-scissors (ala C&C, which I do love as well), or who-can-make-the-most-the-fastest (ala Starcraft, less love but more hours in my younger days).\nThe campaigns are pretty good. I especially enjoyed Winter Assualt, despite it being very short. Call me a sucker for hopeless military stories. Soulstorm is better, though. It plays like a board game, taking over the planet, battling other factions. You win a battle, you take some land and get bonuses later. You lose, you wait until the next turn and plan your next move. Then move in and play what I think (because this is a review) is the best RTS experience since...well, nothing else I've played really matches it.\nDespite the huge number of different armies availible with all expansions, everything is pretty well balanced. Everything caters to different players. How do a bunch of Orks beat a bunch of Space Marines, or a group of Tau beat some Eldar? You have to figure it out. The same thing doesn't work against everyone. And when you have an eight-player free-for-all, what do you do? Endless options, endless replayability.\n\nIt's the 41st Milenium and let's hope war indeed never changes.","December 18, 2013","true","24.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

First the campaign  doesn't make sense. Such as that the space marines and Imperial guard are at war with each other, and that the Sisters of battle are fighting the imperial guard. Also You would think the Battle Sisters  would start on the Chaos/Dark Eldar planet and they shouldn't be fighting the imperial guard because the imperial governer replaced the last one. So the Imperial guard's admistration is competly replaced. These three factions figting each other is illogical.  But however the Battle Sisters are extreme religious miltants that kill anyone who isn't a follower of the emperor in their eyes. People would say that they are fighting for the entire system. In the other dlc's and differnt games such as Space Marine the Space Marines and Imperial Guard are always allies unless they are corrupt. But remember the imperial guard Governer has been replaced since the oringnal  lost the system to xenos and chaos.\n\nSecond con is the difficutly setting on custom battles. On medium the other players are too fast and on easy they are too slow.\n\nExecpt those two negatives I recommend this game, It is very fun and  challeging.  The best part of the game is  killing thousands orks  in a single battle and still lose.\n","March 25, 2015","true","134.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you know how to handle yourself and are happy to jump through a few hoops, Install Titanium Wars, If your looking for a ezy install mod go do Ultimate Apocolypse. I won't be reviewing the game itself, there are other reviews for that, and my opinion is frank, Its the best RTS out there next to Starcraft, and not as outragously competative.  What I will be doing is compairing the two top teir mods for the game.\nUltimate Apocolypse;\nRaces it adds; Tyranids, Deamons, Ordo malleus\nStuff it fixes; Not much (as far as I can see)\nFor unit comparisons I will be using Space Marines, For easy refrence.\nApocolypse adds in a selection of units from table top, as well as 2 titans and fair selection of the bigger tanks. However it feels like things are missing For example, specalised heavy weapons squads along with Dreadnaught Mortis.\nNotes; it is easy to install however it feels like a somewhat paired down version of Titanium Wars\nTitanium Wars;\nRaces Added; Tyranids, Administratum, Ordo Malleus, Wictch Hunters (Semi-conversion of the Sisters Of Battle to bring them on level)\nStuff it Fixes; Removal of unbalanced Air units, AI pathing, Donatioins, and High speed calculations put in, AI is also capable of using the new units to their fullest.\nUnit Comparison;\nAlmost every unit from table top, However against Apoc it only adds 1 titan for balanceing reasons. However it does allow for thing such as thunderhawk deployment of super heavy tanks alongside far more unit customization.\nNotes; Administratum and Ordo Malleus are huge, they feel like they should and have unique units to themselves, The voice acting isn't amazing (the mod-maker is russian) and installing it is a pain due to a complicated series of events that involved a spat between mod makers.\n\nConclusion, I would go for Titanium wars, mainly because it has a larger selection of units and it makes some armies playable in multiplayer, However if you are not after balanced and just want to feild the largest army imagenable and do silly things. go for Apocolypse.\n\nIn short; Get the game. For The Emperor, For the Dark gods, For the Greater Good, whatever battle cry you so choose, but mod it. get a few friends together, get them the game, get them the mods and proceed to smash titans against each other.","June 8, 2015","true","191.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Deimenried/recommended/9450/","Deimenried","Deimenried","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Deimenried/","240 products in account","Having very little experience of Warhammer 40,000 as a tabletop game, I am not going down the road of making any sort of analogy nor comparison. While it may be a strange idea to some, over the years I have had the constant barrage of "Oh, it's nothing like the tabletop game, you know." despite me not having claimed otherwise. Instead I will evaluate its merit as an RPG. I will note at this point that I have also played vanilla Dawn of War and the preceding expansions Winter Assault and Dark Crusade.\n\nOn first coming to this game I found it very easy to pick up. With most races simply having the two basic resources, requisition and power, it was easy enough to settle into the tempo of gameplay. Requisition is collected by taking and holding control points (so no messy resource gathering) and power by building generators anywhere you control. The races each have their own distinct styles of warfare, but when broken down to basics they all follow the same pattern with unit types consistent across all races, so understanding what to make when and how to attack/counterattack is simple. However, the technology trees make advancement slightly different, and tactics must be adapted. Some races have unique benefits and requirements, such as the Orks requiring you to fill the Waaaaaargh! meter to progressively increase the population cap and develop improvements, or the Dark Eldar who gain powers as they consume the souls of fallen enemy troops. The differences make gameplay refreshing when playing as or against the different races.\n\nThe battlefields themselves are well designed for balance (for skirmishes) or to challenge your leadership (for the campaign), with plenty of terrain variations that may help or hinder your troops advancement and survivability in a firefight. The environments too are well varied for visual and, to some extent, tactical enhancement with a healthy mix of wastelands, forests, swamps and cities from across the galaxy to whet your appetite. The campaign is reasonable, but not great, and sees you vying for control of a star system (I won't spoil it) against each of the other races. There are several tactical objectives that can even the odds before you invade a territory Risk-style should you take it. If you have played the Dark Crusade campaign then there's nothing much new with the cinematic-style endgame fights when you strike an enemy's capital, which are actually more structured scenarios than those of regular territory invasions, along with the obligatory cut-scenes.\n\nThere's a decent amount of customisation available throughout, with the in-built Army Painter allowing you to do virtually what would take hours of laborious armwork and make a mess of your room/shed/garage. It has to be said, there is a certain sense of accomplishment seeing your custom flag being raised as you capture a control point. What I do find to be absent is a map editor, so in that respect customisation is a tiny bit limited, and the skirmish maps are all pre-built with no randomisation beyond your starting position (which makes little difference on a symmetrical-ish map).\n\nFrom a graphics standpoint the game is presented very well, with plenty of satisfying and beefy explosions, eerily beautiful plasma bolts and las beams flying around (The Baneblade in particular is especially good at showing these off) and, depending on your particular chipsets (mine not being too spectacular at the minute), the game is easily one of the prettier RTSs around, even now. The AI is decent, although bumbling on easier settings, and should provide a challenge to every skillset.\n\nIn short;\n\nFOR : Simple to pick up, challenging to master. Custom armies. Good graphics, even by today's standards. Nice soundtrack.\nAGAINST : Limited customisation. Pre-built arenas. Not very engaging campaign (compared to previous iterations).\n\nOverall, despite its flaws, I would certainly reccomend you at least try this game. I find it to be enjoyable and quite addictive!","January 4, 2014","true","161.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Like WarCraft 3's hero leveling system, this leaves each match no room for snorefest turtling and it's sweet sweet killing all the time, every time.\nBut be warned, even though the industry is seriously lacking in game demos, do not try this game's demo. You'll only get to try the wimpiest race in the game in 2 lousy singleplayer levels. For the uninitiated, this would misrepresent the game as it has motherloving 9 RACES to play in Total-War-style singleplayer and 2 for multiplayer (buy the base game and/or the other expansions to play their respective races in multiplayer) - one of which is the goth kid Dark Eldar and the other (my personal favorite), the screaming roid rage space nuns of Humanity itself: The Sisters of Battle.\nNote: Game crashes if you alt-tab.
