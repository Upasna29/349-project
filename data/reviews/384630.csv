"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jocosity/recommended/384630/","jocosity","Communist "Joseph Ballin" Layton","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jocosity/","920 products in account","Birds have a long history in gaming, dating back to the mascot wars of the 90s. Games like Sonic the Hedgehog, Spyro the Dragon, and Crash Bandicoot all brought birds to the forefront of gaming entertainment with their colorful bird protagonists, hinting at a bright future for avian kind. But as console generations came and went, the medium's focus shifted, and birds were all but lost in the gaming spectrum. Thankfully, all is not lost, and thanks to sleeper hits like Hatoful Boyfriend and Penguins Arena and the popular Tropes vs. Birds video series by Tweeta Parakeetian, birds are back, and better than ever - which brings us to the latest in bird entertainment, Aviary Attorney.\n\nAvian Attorney is, as it says in the title, a game about birds practicing in the school of law - unlike its bird of a feather, Hatoful Boyfriend (which held its surprise so close to its plumage that even today most people still think it's a joke game about dating birds), this time it's just you, the birds, and the mysteries within. While it's not necessarily an original idea, predated by famous bird lawyer series Harvey Birdman: Attorney at Law more than a decade ago, it provides a fresh perspective through its unique presentation, in both its art style and music.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, Aviary Attorney will probably come as second nature to anyone familiar with the similarly named Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney series (which, despite its misleading title, is not about mystical birds). It's a visual novel with mystery elements, in which you travel between various locations gathering evidence leading up to a court trial. Unlike Phoenix Wright, however, travelling between most locations takes a day of your time, and you only have a certain amount of time before each court session begins, making you think more about where you need to go. There are four cases, with minor choices throughout the cases that lend to replayability (and frequently leave you wondering whether or not you've made a mistake), and the fourth case has 3 varients which are vary significantly both in story and length, and altogether the game lasted me around 7 hours. There are occasional bugs here and there, but the developer seems to be working hard to iron out the problems and in the time I've been playing it there have already been two small patches for it. If you're a fan of mystery games, particularly of the Ace Attorney variety, this is a pretty easy purchase overall. It has enough original elements to keep veterans of the genre on their talons, while providing more of the mysteries that they love.","December 21, 2015","true","8.0"," 261 of 303 people (86%) found this review helpful 156 people found this review funny","86","261","303","156","6"

Ever wanted to be a bird too? Maybe both at the same time? Well, Aviary Attorney gives you the chance.\n\nIn nicely drawn backgrounds Sketchy Logic let´s the animal kingdom have free reign in the courtyard, when the player takes over the role of JayJay Falcon, Attorney at his majestys court.\nBeginning harmlessly enough, with day to day murderers, JayJays way brings him on the brink of revolution and on death´s door himself. All the while only relaying on his falcon beak sharp mind and the wit of his trusty sidekick Sparrowson.\n\nWhile the gameplay itself is basically a visual novel, including finding and combining clues, using them at court and interrogation, it also offers some different paths, where you´re decisions or even lack of finding every clue will count.\nThe cases are fun to play through and the story is engaging enough, to even try to get some different endings.\nUndeniable the best part of the game though is the humor, which the dialogues are full of.\n\nThe setting is, as written earlier visually and musically very nicely done. The backgrounds show some of Paris most famous sites and are well drawn, as well as the character art. While there is no real speech, each character has it´s own way of sound, while speaking, a small, fun detail, which enhances the atmosphere even further, when the wolf and lion sound much "stronger" than the little rabbit.\n\nConclusio:\nI had much fun with Aviary Attorney and if you´re interested in the setting, bird jokes, Attorney and/or VN games etc. this game is surely worth a try. Can´t say much bad about it honestly.\n\nPoint Scale: 8/10\n\n","February 27","true","6.9"," 59 of 60 people (98%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","98","59","60","3","2"

Upon advancing the plot past the trial, where I did not have any evidence useful for cross-examination, the game simply went to a screen that said something along the lines of 'We haven't finished this yet, sorry!', and I had to manually close it. This is a huge disappointment to me, as it is one of the games I've had the most fun playing in a while.\n\nUPDATE: I now see that yesterday, the developers updated the game and finally finished it!

Also, have to give credit for great mouse and keyboard controls, expecting the game to have generic directional controls but contradicting my thought and providing great controls for the platform it was released in.\n\nWorth buying?

Because what makes it unique isn't the fact that it is a mystery visual novel, but the lovably-strange characters, the dialogues that are so cheesy for most of the time you just have to laugh about them, the remarkable soundtracks, and also the few adventure elements do their share. And Aviary Attorney is probably the closest, and in my opinion best thing to the original games I've played so far.\n\nWhy? Because it doesn't even try to hide its source of inspiration (I mean, just reading the game title indicates that much.), it is an almost shameless copy of Ace Attorney in every aspect I mentioned above, and it's doing this just great. I've really had a lot of fun with these four cases and have no complaints about their quality, although especially the first two are quite short.\n\nSo, if you're an Ace Attorney fan: Buy this game, you will most certainly love it like I did.\nIf you're not into Ace Attorney or even visual novels: Give it a try anyway, it might be a great possibility for you to get into both of these things (I'm not that much of a VN fan myself). But, one way or another, Aviary Attorney definitely deserves more attention.\n\nAnd if you'll excuse me now, I think I'll be going back to waiting for Ace Attorney 6.","January 9","true","12.2"," 29 of 32 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","29","32","3","0"

It was more of a tutorial but I think it was enough to give a statement about this game.\n\nFirst of all there is the artstyle. I have to say that I'm a big fan of it. The drawn characters and backgrounds give this game a unique feeling and make it really good looking. The monochrome colorscheme can eventually get a little bit irritating for the eyes but that can also come from being a little bit tired.\n\nThe music of the game is fantastic. It doesn't distract from the game, while at the same time underlining the setting.\n\nThe game is full of puns and the dialoges are great. I really like to talk to the Characters and how you have the possibility to follow your own moral compas through different decisions.\n\nSomething that shines throug is the fact, that this game is based on the Pheonix Wright games. The court system is a little bit different because there is a Jury to convince but in general there are a lot of similarities. (Like the "Not Guilty"-Message over the screen to call out one example of many). I didn't have a problem with that because it doesn't feel like a copy of those games,  just like there's a of inspiration from those games that has mixed into this game.\n\nAfter an hour of playtime I have to say that I love the game and the setting and I'm really looking forward to playing the rest of it tomorrow.","December 21, 2015","true","2.2"," 39 of 53 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","39","53","2","0"

Every investigation and action does influence the outcome of court proceedings and/or story, which may prove to be tricky as time is limited and investigation choices increase as chapter goes that one is never sure which one is a false lead/useful lead (unless you are using a guide). Also, the 4th case is dependent on your actions in case 3, and there are 3 alternative cases (with 1 of them being unreleased). The storyline is a tad short, but surprisingly complex and intriguing as it revolves around the grey area of law (the ending of the first case does gut the heart already) and the meaning of justice. If you aren't inclined of the animal characters but wants to know whether the story is worth it, then AA will not disappoint.\n\nHowever, there are a few notable drawbacks. First being that there are a few typos in-game. They're relatively minor and few, but it'd be nice if the game is a wee polished. Also, saving in the middle of a conversation seems impossible; if one "Save and Quit" during a convo, it usually loads from when the scene started. And lastly, one of the ending paths (4C) is incomplete, resulting in lots of complaints and negative feedback (expected release date: 29th Dec 2015). There has been a few bug reports on game blackout, but I encountered none so far. My only complaint is the inability to share screenshot, though it's unsure whether the game has disabled screenshot or it's my setting problem (because there has been people who have posted screenies).\n\nNevertheless, apart from the few drawbacks, the game is mostly interesting and is worth the purchase imo. AA is easily completed within 5~8 hours. (And yes, please ignore my game time. I was paranoid about the save that I left the game running while AFKing).","December 25, 2015","true","33.6"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","15","20","0","0"

Characters have interesting anthropromorphic animal designs, the characters are likeable and memorable, and the dialogue is clever. Fans of the Ace Attorney series will definitely find a lot of similarities from that series in this game, but there are enough differences and new twists to make this game worth it. For example, there are branching paths (you can get three major endings in fact), and it is possible to fail cases and continue the game with your failure affecting various portions. Investigation segments are also a lot of fun due to having to choose carefully on where you choose to investigate. If you make poor choices, you might not get all the info and evidence necessary to save your client.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this game, especially to fans of the Ace Attorney series.\n\nMy only complaint is the lack of sound effects for guns.

The writing is cute and engaging, and the characters can be a lot of fun.\n\nBut on the whole, I've found the game disappointingly buggy. Sometimes it's just that the dialogue options haven't been thought through properly (for instance, if you need to choose a character from the list of characters you know to accuse of something or to ask about, and you choose the wrong person for the storyline, the characters will say something like 'Who is that person?' even if it was a friend of theirs, which makes things very confusing for the player, since you start worrying you pressed the wrong button or something). Once, in Act 3, I asked about an unimportant piece of data and midway through discussing it the dialogue skipped back to a previous conversation on a different subject.\n\nSometimes the bugs are bigger. It's already been noted that depending on how you play through, Act 4 may not be accessible to you at all. I made a mistake in Act 3 and Act 4 isn't accessible to me, so I went back to play from Act 2, but when I try to load Day 1 of Act 2, it bugs out and gives me an illustration, but no characters or dialogue and I can't move forward. I feel that this game has a pretty hefty price for mostly text-based gameplay if it's going to have this many game-halting problems with it. It's not just the unfinished Act 4, there are a number of serious and confusing problems that really affect the experience or sometimes terminate it altogether. Especially if the game is going to be so unforgiving (going to a location that I had a lead for a day earlier than I was apparently supposed to caused me to fail my goal in Act 2), and going to halt your progress if you make certain decisions, then it really needs to be able to reload properly from previous days.\n\nI think this game could be really great, but it's lacking polish and completion in several serious areas, so at the moment I don't think it can be said to be worth $15 or even $13.","December 29, 2015","false","7.7"," 19 of 28 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","19","28","0","0"

People will talk about a horrid, or unfinished ending, but this game ends on a note that makes you want more.\nWith evidence of completing the game after 4 acts, the best ending I have reached in a game since Fallout New: Vegas, I believe we have a bit of a gem on our hands, and that you should not waste this opportunity.

I am well-aware that this game is incomplete. While releasing an incomplete game looks very unprofessional for a dev...I'm willing to let this one slide. I've only completed the first act so far. I played it as if this were the original Phoenix Wright, and the ending of this act proved that it was something different. Not only does the game have a lot of humor and charm, but it is surprising and works with the tropes of the game it's based off of very well. Aside from a few pixellated graphics here and there, I find the old-looking pen and ink art style to be oddly fitting and very charming as well, and the sprites are all very well illustrated. The music's good, but by default it's a bit loud; luckily, you can change the volume of the music in the settings, so it's not a huge complaint.\n\nAll in all, I'm willing to wait for the rest of the game to be complete. Because I have a good feeling it will be worth the wait.","January 2","true","1.4"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

You see, most of the cases rely on a clock, that ticks after each place you visit. Either you do things as fast as you can, in a correct manner, skipping very interesting places in the process, or you're stuck and out of luck. Eventually you'll come across a case that requires a piece of evidence that the game didn't let you grab, and instead of just going for the "we have nothing to show for it" à la Ace Attorney, you can only fail intentionally 3 times because the frickin' inventory screen won't go away, further aggravating your rage.\n\nImportant/interesting key objects that get in your inventory and that might be used in later stages, actually don't get used at all and are simply discarded, with characters pretending to have never seen such a thing.\n\nTo top it off, there is no "quick skip" dialogue if you want to just mow over dialogues you already read several times and stopping it on "new dialogues" only.\n\nHell, there isn't even a way to save right where you are. I mistakenly took the "Save & Quit" option in the menu as actually save and quit, only to find out that upon reload all the dialogues were reset, and basically I had to redo most of the stuff I went through, because there are no in-between save states.\n\nSo, to sum it all up:\nyou can't properly save and load if your life depended on it;\nyou can't explore because you're on a clock;\nyou cannot skip dialogues that you have to mandatorily read multiple times if you want to experience all the endings;\nsince clock often ticks when you visit a place, if you want to actually go back to some place you already visited, the additional visit also takes time off the clock… god forbid you willingly go to a place where it turns out there was nothing helpful…\nNo, this game has failed me completely, ruining the experiences I like the most in games of this genre. The fact they made it possible for players to be hindered by their will to explore more of the game, is an unforgivable sin.","January 25","false","5.5"," 42 of 72 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","42","72","0","1"

I recommend the game highly, you should get it.\n\nLet's look at the individual aspects though.\n\nPlaytime:\nMy playtime is accurate at 4.7 hours. I consider my playtime to be around average. I didn't scrounge for every single piece of dialogue, but I also had a slightly higher reading pace. If you have difficulties with logic puzzle games, this may be a bit longer as I think I figured out necessary actions fairly quickly.This will bring the total playtime to around 5 hours when the last route releases. I would consider that a respectable amount for the price point.\n\nMusic:\nThe music for the game is very solid. The soundtrack brings appropriate ambiance that fits both the story's setting of old France and it plays to the situation at hand. I was never jarred by off-putting choices of music at any point. My only criticism of the music is there wasn't any that felt catchy or memorable enough. I have no urge to open up the soundtrack to just listen to a particular song.\n\nVisuals:\nThe visuals speak for themselves. Absolutely stunning and unique. From the backgrounds to the character art, the game looks great and I find myself eager to explore new zones just to see what they look like. Nothing to say here but praise. Great work.\n\nWriting:\nHere's where the game gets really juicy. The game accomplishes what it tries to do perfectly. The humor in the game goes well beyond just puns and animal jokes. Exclamatory remarks, running jokes, and wordplay are all done with great timing and execution.\n\nThe characters themselves are indeed memorable and unique. No one felt like a copy of each other or even as adhering to an established character archetype. You will undoubtedly find a favorite among the cast. The character development is also quite nice as well, flowing naturally and without feeling forced.\n\nThe story is quite engaging and progresses. Your choices do matter and the chapters flow into one another, not standalone episodes. You follow the main character's story and see how far they will go. The conflicting ideologies presented in the game are quite well done. Both sides are presented fairly, neither being demonized, and you get to see some of the humanity behind each train of thought. I really love how they did this and I appreciate the writer's efforts.\n\n\nGameplay:\nIt's inevitable to talk about this game without talking about a certain other series. However, I wouldn't go so far as to say took mechanics and ideas, but it feels more like a love letter to a beloved memory. The gameplay is very good and separated into 2 main sections: trials and exploration. You explore, get evidence, and meet people to prepare for the upcoming trials. Your success in exploring will carry you through the trial. The game presents a very nice tutorial section that exposes you to all the mechanics before getting more and more complex in a very natural way. I would liken this to a logic puzzle, where common sense and intuition rule and will be your friend. I personally enjoyed the gameplay very much, and you probably will too if you're even just looking into the game to see what it's about. I will say, it will take more than one playthrough and some testing to try and get all the endings.\n\n\nClosing remarks:\nIf the price point puts you off, don't worry about it. The game is worth the money and you're supporting the devs and their hard work. They need to eat too.\n\nThe game is also still being polished. During my first playthrough, I encountered a few bugs, but those were quickly patched out. The devs are responsive and looking to create a great experience.\n\nThe writing, gameplay, and art of the game are all astounding and some of the best I've seen out of a project like this.\n\nI look forward to the game's success, the future works of the devs, and maybe even a sequel if they're so kind.","December 23, 2015","true","5.2"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

So I may not be as helpful as others.\n\nA video of this piece can be found here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSiIYKuvGL4&feature=youtu.be\n\nAviary Attorney unfolds in 19th century France, where an attorney named Jayjay Falcon and his petite assistant Sparrowson defend many anthropomorphic animals in the courtroom.  Or as Sparrowson abrasively states, “help people get away with criminal acts”.  The duo investigate crime scenes and testimonies to craft a repertoire of evidence to defend their client.  And ultimately find the truth behind every illusive crime.\n\nThe writing is impeccable in Aviary Attorney.  It retains all the wit and courtroom drama of Ace Attorney with the banter of Hatoful Boyfriend.  Every joke had near flawless comedic timing and even after the 20th horse pun I was still in stitches.  The different acts follow different cases, and can each be played in 2-3 hours easily.  Through every character there’s a voice that resonates when reading their dialogue, proving that the written word in visual novels can still resonate even without voice acting.\n\nAviary Attorney retains the artistic integrity of caricature artist, Jean Ignace Isidore Gérard Grandville.  Rather than the colorful hyper-realism of Hatoful Boyfriend, the artstyle in Aviary Attorney is predominantly weathered yellow backdrops with hand drawn character models overlayed.  If you’ve ever played Phoenix Wright, the eccentric character models may pop into mind.  Aviary Attorney takes inspiration with this.  And combined with the anthropomorphic elements, it creates a great composition of colorful characters, even though it’s pastels are black and white.\n\nThe music in Aviary Attorney is composed by French 19th century artist Camille Saint-Saëns, and its authenticity really brings the world to life.  With every orchestration reflecting the bourgeoisie atmosphere of early France.  It’s a very great and smart decision to use pieces of the era instead of attempting to replicate the early art in an OST.\n\nAs a Visual novel, Aviary Attorney has very minimal gameplay besides menu navigations and pursuing through text. However, unlike most visual novels.  Aviary Attorney takes inspiration from one of the most renown visual novels in gaming history.  The GBA and DS classics, Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney (which surprisingly didn’t feature a feathered protagonist) from Capcom.  Aviary Attorney takes the formula of that first game, where after an introduction to the murder case you interview witnesses and examine crime scenes to gather crucial evidence.  Following your investigations, it’s off to the courtroom.  Where you must use aforementioned evidence to seduce the jury to your side.  By combing over witness statements and contradicting affidavits with evidence you will gain the jury’s mindshare, but by wasting their time you lose their enthusiasm with the person you’re defending.  Getting over each obstacle and test with minimal dissatisfaction from the jury, will result in the real murderer revealing himself and your client will be saved from the guilty verdict.\n\nA hefty 25 hour game with multiple endings, Aviary Attorney fully justifies it’s 15 dollar price tag.  I’m not a big fan of Visual Novels, but Aviary Attorney is a great lampoon of the Ace Attorney formula with its interactivity.  This isn’t to say that Aviary Attorney is a bad Visual Novel, the writing is astonishing and comedic.  While France has been depicted in Assassin’s Creed, the music and art in Aviary Attorney bring the place and period to life in a way that is significantly pure.  The attention to detail the folks at Sketchy Logic have for the time period doubles in the respect they have for the history and time period.  Aviary Attorney is a compilation of great writing, art, music, and characters.  And one of 2015’s most significant surprises.","January 1","true","11.7"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","1"

You'll be examining evidence, trying to find errors in cross examinations, and interviewing people of interest to try and put together the various cases and mysterys as they unvold into a bigger picture. What seperates Aviary Attorney though is a creative art style that you won't find anywhere else, with a cheeky and irreverent sense of humor. The game also better punishes you for your mistakes, if you miss a piece of evidence, or badger a witness too much, you won't restart the case, you'll move on to the next one with consequences that effect the remaining trails. This is unique and opens it up to multiple playthroughs with vastly branching stories, and creates a more complete experiance. As for the story, the characters are fun and memorable, and well deliver plenty of chuckles (albeit likely no full belly-laughs).\n\nThe big problem dosen't rear it's ugly head untill late in the game, in my first playthrough I reached a branch in the story where I had not gathered the correct evidence for an impromptu trail, resulting in a text screen that read something along the lines of "Sorry, this ending is unfinished! Check back in two days!" And the game crashed.\n\nNot that it's super relevant, but it's but more than two days, almost a week.\n\nNowhere on the store page does it advertise this being an uncomplete game, nor does it label it with a "Steam Greenlight" or "Beta" nomiker. This game had a kickstarter, and was delayed at least once, so why not wait the extra time and release the full game? I cannot reccomend purchasing this in the current condition (12/30/15), and possibly cannot reccomend a purchase even if this unfinished ending is patched in. This is lying to the customer, you NEED to advertise that your game is NOT finished, an improumptu text screen is simply NOT enough. Since this part of the game was almost 4 hours in, a refund was not possible, but if it had been I would have gotten one. Skethy Logic games needs to properly address this situation, as it is a dangerous practice in video gaming, and plagued what was otherwise an extremely pleasent experiance.\n\n","December 30, 2015","false","4.0"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","11","17","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyrilpanda/recommended/384630/","cyrilpanda","Cyril","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyrilpanda/","596 products in account","Comparisons to Ace Attorney are inevitible, as they're intentionally self-evoked here, but Aviary Attorney does have more than enough to it that makes it a much different experience.\n\nFor one, the game is more about breadth than depth. The main storyline only took me around 4 hours to complete, but my playtime double going through the game again to see alternate paths and the other two endings. Each trial has multiple outcomes that can affect the story in different ways ranging from a few small details to three distinct endings. The game has a lot more replayability to it than the linear Ace Attorney games, and that's not a knock against Ace Attorney either, the linearity allows the game to provide a much more in-depth story.\n\nThat's not to say the story in Aviary Attorney is lacking; far from it. What starts off as a silly bird-lawyering game escalates into a turbulent tale of rebellion and violence, with three potential outcomes. The game is far darker than Ace Attorney ever gets, and the scope of your actions is far more reaching than the relatively minimal stakes the Ace Attorney series sticks to. There's a variety of characters with interesting personality quirks and a good dose of humor as well, the game can still be fairly lighthearted at times, but going in expecting something as over-the-top silly as Ace Attorney would be a mistake.\n\nThe gameplay also differs a fair bit. For one, it's much more fast-paced. Investigations are done a day at a time, and you have a limited time to get everything done that you need done, making it possible to fail any trial if you don't have proper evidence (or simply present the wrong evidence too many times). The first case is fairly trivial to complete, but it's possible to miss some crucial details in the second case and the third case is actually quite strict as far as what you need to do to ensure a successful trial, while giving you more options than you'll know what to do with. There's a bit of a trial-and-error element but when you have a sense of what you're missing or what you did wrong, it's not too hard to put the pieces together and have a perfect case after only a replay or two. And replays can be done fairly quick as the text is all fast to skip.\n\nIf I were to have any real problems with the game, it would mostly come down to three issues. First, path 4A is a bit... awful, storywise. It forces one of the main characters way out of character to push an overly dramatic and hard to take seriously storyline, though since the player intentionally has to initiate this ending, perhaps it was done on purpose? Either way, I wouldn't consider this ending "canon", and it's only one of three.\n\nThe second issue is that there are a fair few instances of script breaking, where the game will have assumed an event took place even if it didn't. This tends to only occur if you intentionally try to screw up things though, and the only major script break I encountered was a result of intentionally failing the first case early, though there are certainly others to be found.\n\nThe third issue, and this is only a minor nitpick, is the price vs. length issue. 8 hours is what it took for me to experience the vast majority of what this game has to offer (some branching dialogue paths and two failure states I didn't achieve that wouldn't change much in the long run) and while it's not impossible that I'll revisit it in the future, it still feels either a tad short for the price or a tad overpriced for the length.\n\nBut I digress, anyways. It's a very well-made game with a great story, a unique and interesting art style, and there are bird puns. I quite enjoyed my experience with this game, in spite of the small issues I have with it. Definitely recommended.","January 21","true","7.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Can you get your clients off the hook or will they find their goose is cooked? Bird puns out of my system let's get down to it!\n\nGameplay is greatly inspired by the Phoenix Wright series. Anyone experienced in those games will easily understand how this game works. You'll wade through sticky tangled webs of court room drama. Scour the cobblestone streets and back alleys of Paris for clues, make decisions on whether or not to use less than legal methods to obtain evidence, examine witness testimony, use logic and deduction in order to put all the pieces together to present your case. All the while coming to discover serving "justice" can be a messy complex affair.\n\nThe first thing to probably hit you is the astounding whimiscal caricature artwork that's highlighted throughout the game. Along with the backgrounds that range from smoke ridden taverns, to that of genuine historic sites and palaces of 19th century Paris. The anthropomorphic characters make up wonderfully strange an beautiful imagery. The artistic style of Jean-Jacques Grandville very much stands out for it's ability to conjure up such fantastic characters. The background surroundings you find yourself in are mainly borrowed from old illustrations that you would find in ads, catalogs and publications of the time. Pairing these two together and piecing them into a story results in a remarkable great looking game.\n\nMusic consists of many wonderfully orchestrated classical scores. Including the very fitting and recognizable "Funeral March Of A Marionette" that many would recall from it's use in the Alfred Hitchcock television show. Everything sound wise fits in with the period and serves to enhance the dramatic tense undergoings of the court room.\n\nWriting and plot can make or break this type of game. Luckily the story is full of some great moments. Especially as you delve deeper into each case. The story likes to leave you with certain doubts by unfolding the dastardly truth along with the glaring cracks that make up our imperfect sense of justice. It leaves you with some thought provoking feelings as you consider the different possiblities and motives of each case you're assigned. The writer seems to make good choices as to when to inject humor and when to take itself more seriously. It keeps the over all atmosphere and tone to each scene consistant and immersive. Resisting falling into the trap of trying to hard to slap you in face with jokes, which can be tempting to do in this type of game. Nor does it always take itself to seriously and knows when to use timing to deliver a good joke.\n\nAll in all it's a very interesting game that any lover of adventures, visual novels, and of course Ace Attorney games will appreciate. I would personally rate Aviary Attorney overall as a 9 out of 10. Highly recommended good fun that draws you in and makes it hard to put down.","January 5","true","11.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I could handle falling behind on the update schedule. I could even deal with having the game released unfinished. I could have given all of this a pass, IF they had been upfront about it. But they haven't been. You have to hunt through the description to find a hint that the game is still being finished. A few days ago, the developers made a tweet promising an update for the game by "the end of the day", which would have included the new ending, plus typo and bug fixes. It's been almost three days since "the end of the day", and I have seen neither an update to the game, nor any acknowledgement of, let alone explanation for, the delay (see edit).\n\nLook, I truly want to defend the game to everyone who is criticizing it. I want to justify all the mistakes the developers have made for those who are criticizing them. But there is such a total, utter lack of transparency on the part of the developers that it's impossible for me to do so. I truly love what I have played of the game so far. But with how the developers have been handling it, I absolutely cannot in good faith recommend that people actually pay money and support these developers.\n\nPerhaps I will eventually be able to change this review to a positive one. Perhaps we will eventually be able to put all of this behind us, and I will be able to recommend the game to everyone for what it is. But the developers have lost my trust with these practices (and not easily, mind you). Until the developers finish the game (see edit), own up to their mistakes, and begin being much more transparent in their practices, I cannot recommend this game to anyone.\n\nEdit: As of January 5, the last main chapter of the game is finished. I should also mention that they have at least made some acknowledgement (via tweet, and this post) of the massive delay behind actually finishing the game. It's not much, but it's a start at least. We'll see what happens going forward, since they've still promised further updates, including a bonus chapter. They've also said on Twitter (a while ago) that they're going to do some sort of "post-mortem" on the mess with releasing this game, though I personally wouldn't expect it any time soon.","January 1","false","8.0"," 17 of 30 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","17","30","0","0"

Stick with me, there's more to this, or this would be a thumbs-up.\n\nThere's a good narrative, but the gameplay suffers for it.  The gameplay is immaterial for the first half of the game; while it's true that winning or losing a trial affects the game, it's a cosmetic difference in the end.  Nothing actually changes, you're not locked into or out of any ending.  There's a lot of promise here, with the time passing mechanic, the ability to miss evidence and lose lose trials and continue, and having a jury to convince, but the game shifts narrative gears after two cases and that opportunity is squandered.\n\nMy other big complaint is that the game deliberately attempts to evoke Ace Attorney, and does a poor job in practice.  The gameplay is incredibly shallow; you never have more than a couple handfuls of evidence, and the contradictions should be incredibly easy to spot for any veteran of the series.  The most likely thing to trip you up is the time mechanic.  It's also short.  I've got 4.4 hours on record; that's how long it takes to beat the game and get every ending.\n\nTruth be told, this would probably be better without what feels like a token amount of gameplay.  The narrative is interesting, and if you're looking for a good short story you could do worse.  However, you will likely leave very disappointed if you're looking for gameplay of Ace Attorney caliber, as I was, which is why this is getting a negative review.","March 9","false","4.4"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","1"

For starters, the player is expected to work out the best part of the city to investigate each day before a case. You get between 3 days to 2 weeks to perform a cursory investigation for each case, and you have to make sure each day counts. This had its ups and downs to me, since at times I felt I wasn't psychic enough to know the best sequence of locations to visit. For what it's worth, the game allows you to rewind to any previous day very easily, but it may mean skipping through dialog.\n\nTheir better improvement is in cross examinations. Rather than scrolling through a series of statements and blindly presenting one piece of evidence as "contradicting" it (a simple gameplay rule that Phoenix Wright breaks at times) the witness's testimony is shown as one paragraph on a sheet, and JayJay underlines a few statements he can ask about. When you do, you get a few choices about topic; delving too far on an unrelated line can cause you to lose favor with the jury, whereas you will need to delve if you think you've found a subject that you can present contradictory evidence for.\n\nFor fans of Ace Attorney, this is surely a game to try out. If it has one failing, it's one that lots of small-time adventure games seem to fall into, in which later in the game, the gameplay begins to serve the storyline, rather than the other way around. For the last 30 minutes of the game or so you'll likely just be progressing dialog and picking obvious location/evidence choices rather than unravelling a complicated murder mystery. However, I happened to only do one of several options that led to this - It turns out that your actions in Case 3 can actually cause the final case to happen in one of several ways. SO, there is a possibility that this result is only one way things may happen.","December 27, 2015","true","4.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

While I've never played the Ace Attorney games myself, I'm told this one draws a lot from those, with its own twists on the formula. You gather evidence through interviews and exploration of the crime scene and other places, stretching the role of what a defence attorney really does, and then you'll be given the chance to use that evidence against in the courtroom during cross-examinations by clicking on the part of a witness' statement you're able to contradict. It's simple, and not especially difficult, but it's fun and satisfying to work out and the developing storylines are entertaining and well-written, even if they can be predictable at times.\n\nIt's all just so irresistibly charming, with a witty sense of humour and a colourful cast of characters. The art style, which literally just involves pasting animal heads onto 1800's paintings, looks sharp and distinct and really helps you immerse yourself in this seemingly alternate-history 1840's France. The main cast makes for a memorable pair, and I was frankly sad to have to see them go when I finished up the game. Though it's all over pretty fast, it's a satisfying journey and can end in multiple ways, with three entirely distinct final chapters depending on your choices in the third act, all of which can come to different conclusions.\n\nWith the multiple finales to be explored, there's actually a pretty good amount of content here, even if I found some of the finales more interesting than others. One was just what I wanted, the other was surprisingly good even if it started out a bit grim, and the third just seemed a little too dark and out of tone with the rest of the game. Despite that, they were all fun to explore and worth playing through, even if sometimes their endings felt a bit abrupt.\n\nI really can't think of anything I disliked about this one, other than it being a bit short and sometimes not entirely clear where you should go to find your clues. It's possible to miss important pieces of evidence by failing to visit the places you can find them or screwing something up when you get there, and if you do manage to fail a case, the story continues on rather than making you replay it, which is good but I can imagine would be a lot less satisfying an experience. Though it might be funny to play it again and fail the early cases on purpose just to see what happens.\n\nIf you're a fan of visual novel kinds of things, and like murder mysteries and courtroom antics, then I hope you'll enjoy this one as much as I did.","February 12","true","10.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I'm writing this to show my genuine appreciation for this lovely piece of work.\n\nAnd what a piece of work it is. I expected it to just be a jokey game full of puns and without anything big beyond the gimmick of animal people and avian lawyers. If you decide to buy and play it, you might expect Avian Attorney to be just that based on the first five, maybe ten minutes of play. I - and you, if you follow my train of thought - could not be more wrong. I won't go into details to avoid spoiling parts of the game, but it utterly gripped me.\n\nThe characters you're supposed to like are likeable, the characters you ought to hate make themselves out to be absolute scum of the earth based on their in-game actions. It's all very believable as well, the plot and subplots seamlessly and smoothly hurry onward while you frantically make sense of courtroom law and procedure.\n\nThe game will last you about five hours if you do some reloading and read most of the text. More if you explore every path (I can recommend trying all three endings, they're amazing and very different from one another), less if you skip through it (don't). Expect to play it in one or two sittings, it's very hard to put the game down.\n\nIf a sequel or some other similar game by this studio appears I'm buying it as soon as possible. It's just quality, dammit.\n","February 13","true","5.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

Coupled with the solid writing and at least one or two interesting twists thus far - I've finished the first act - I can happily say it is at least equal with the more famous Lawyer Game's writing.\n\nMuch like Ace Attorney, you follow an Attorney - here, one JJ Falcon - and his Assistant - Sparrowson -. The two have a delightful dynamic, and descriptions for items and the locations you find are, while punny, quite delightful.\n\nIf you've ever played an Ace Attorney game, you should know what to expect; you go to locations, examine specific items - which are highlighted for you, to prevent tedious pixelhunting - and, later on, use those items and your findings in trials, to prove your points and make objections.\n\nIt's not wholly identical to Ace Attorney, however. Going to certain locations takes up a day's time, and it is possible to lose favor with the jury by needlessly pressing on witness statements.  These statements have, thus far tended more towards being clear, concise pieces of logic; a vital necessity given the way the game works.\n\nIn short, if you're a fan of the Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney series, you owe it to yourself to pick up Aviary Attorney.","December 21, 2015","true","1.3"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

Combining fantasic visuals, fitting classical music, and witty writing, Aviary Attorney is a must for AA fans who wouldn't mind seeing some new stories with new faces.  Their are some new mechanics to play around with too.  Managing time and money adds to the stress of defending your clients, though I feel that the features lacked some depth.  The addition of a jurist system makes perfect sense and works well from a gameplay perspective as well.\n\nThat's not to there aren't faults though.  The game is a tad short, with none of the cases being terribly long (though that's not to say they aren't difficult at times).   Expect to see lots of returning characters and locations between cases as well (surely a result  of being a Kickstarter funded infie game).

With a refreshing, underused setting of 19-th century France, beautiful artwork by J. J. Grandsville, and a musical score that ranges from whimsicall to outright epic, Aviary Attorney turns into an experience thatI had no idea that I had wanted previously.\n\nFor those who aren't familiar with the Ace Attorney-style detective games, here's a brief introduction: The main characters ar edefense atorneys, who have a new case brought upon them with each chapter. In the alloted days leading up to the trial, they must travel about the city in search of evidence so that their defendant may walk free from impending incarceration. The unique gameplay element that Aviary Attorney introduces is the ability to fail a case and have the story progress in spite of it. Because of this, the game allows you to re-load any given day within a chapter so the player may make new decisions and achieve a different outcome. This is really handy, considering that there are several subplots that can develop differently over the course of the first three chapters.\n\nOne of my favorite additions this game brings to the genre is its sense of scale. Aviary Attorney takes place in a society on the cusp of revolution. The meta-narrative of the game is presented not only in some of the major cases, but also in optional cutscenes that not only flesh out the world, but do so in a manner that helps present the story in a manner akin to a noir television serial.\nWithin the three possible endings you can achieve, it's very interesting to see how our characters will eveolve along with the plot. There's welcome character growth within each route that builds on previous cases in a different way. It's definitely one of the best introductions of consequence in a murder-mystery game.\n\nThis game is definitely worth it's price if you're itching for a new murder mystery series to explore.With the added ability to fail a given trial and have the story go on despite it, the game's ability to re-load any individual day of a case allows for an unexpected ammount of replayability. Fans of mystery novels, the French revolutionary period, and witty humor should definitely crack this one open!","February 15","true","6.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The graphics and music give me great joy to see as well, so unique-flavoured in this sea of either cute or serious games.\n\nHowever, there is still a few... bugs? On first starting of the game, we end up looking at a tiny windowed black screen and that persists despite waiting for quite a while. This happens on two Win7 computers and can be fixed by closing and restarting the game, and it never happens again. I prefer if the game started as fullscreen as well.\n\nDespite the inevitable bugs of a new game, I'm glad this game exists. I love the humor of playing as birds. In the midst of the long wait for Dai Gyakusai to be localised, so this is a most joyful distraction that fills the Attorneying emptiness in my heart.","December 24, 2015","true","16.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The period artwork, the atmosphere, the accompanying music, and the charming characters, all melt together perfectly to make a brilliant experience.

Yes, one of the variants of the final chapter is missing from the game at the time of writing. But it will probably be back in fairly soon and you don't have to pay for it, so I don't really see the issue. Also, you only get the particular version of the chapter if you ♥♥♥♥ up the previous one. So, uh, don't do that, I guess.\n\nSpeaking of elephants in rooms, you may have noticed that all of the characters are animals. The art style is actually one of the game's strongest points. And I don't say that often. The fact that they're animals is hardly important to the plot, beyond a few puns and maybe cats clawing people to death. It's a neat way of having all the characters be visually distinct without resorting to ♥♥♥♥♥♥ anime drawings. And despite the game being a visual novel, there are quite a few charming little animations to give things a bit more character.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty inventive, but sadly underutilised. It's like Ace Attorney, unsurprisingly. There's an investigation phase, where you talk to witnesses and look for clues, and then the trial phase, where you present evidence to contradict the witness' testimony. It's all very talky. The key difference with Aviary Attorney is the time limit during the investigation phase. Each place you investigate will take you a full day, and you have only a limited time before the trial starts. If you faff about going to the same locations too many times, or in the wrong order, you might not have all the clues ready for the trial. Which means you might not get the best possible ending.\n\nThis is something a lot of mystery games lack- an actual failure state. Too many allow you to click on everything until you find the solution. It's neat that the game doesn't patronise me by making the solution too obvious.\n\nIt's not all perfect though. I found the game to be pretty easy- I got the best ending for every case on my first try. I mean, it probably helps that I've played Ace Attorney and Danganronpa before, but even if you haven't, the game heavily hints at where to go next during the investigation phase, and the trial phase usually has fairly obvious contradictions. If you don't know what to do during the trial, just press every statement. Eventually, someone will say something like "I bet you can't prove that the witness owns a massive blood stained knife", at which point you present a bloody knife with their name signed on the handle.\n\nThe trials are also very short. There's only really two full trials to sink your teeth into. The first case is more of a tutorial and the fourth is just an excuse for some story. Not even particularly good story, the variant I ended up with (the one you get for succeeding in Act 3) was all about protecting a character the player doesn't care about. I can't really blame the developers, it's enough for the price tag, but I guess Ace Attorney has spoiled me into wanting more.\n\nBesides the last act the writing is actually pretty excellent. It's funny, and not just "funny by video game humour standards". Legitimately funny. It also completely avoids the common mistake VNs make of describing a thing we can already see because it's a VISUAL novel.\n\nIn short:\n\nPros:\n+Excellent writing\n+Unique art styles\n+Interesting investigations and trials\n+Likeable characters\n\nNegatives:\n-A little on the short side\n-Too easy\n-A few mild bugs\n-No log to reread dialogue that you might have missed\n-Slightly incomplete\n\nIn short, it's a unique game that's worth experiencing despite its flaws.

In a nutshell, it's in the vein of Phoenix Wright. You get hired to defend clients, investigate crime scenes, unearth clues, and then conduct the trial itself. However this game allows you freedom to investigate where and when. You can even get the wrong people convicted or cleared of guilt, not to mention manage time poorly and miss clues. It's the branching path of possibilities and freedom that genuinely make this more fun to play than the afore mentioned series.\n\nA real hidden gem of a game.

If you have played Ace Attourney games Ill happily recommend this to you. It has the similar charm and wit, although unlike Ace Attourney you seem to actualy have a time limit. And a lawyer who actualy seems to know about court etiquette and rules.\n\nAlso the investigation parts wandering around Paris provide a refressing chance to screw up. You could simply use too many days simply playing Blackjack in the tavern. Or maybe you missclicked and ended the investigation inside your current location.\n\nHeres a quick summary of the positives and negatives\n\n+ Wonderful artstyle.\nJean Jaques Grandevilles 18th century art comes alive and the animal characters fit the story.\n\n+ Music is fantastic.\nClassical music fiths the 18th century like chocolate on a croissant\n\n+The story is intriguing.\nThe different cases in the game provide decent variety in terms of turns and events. The game managed to even surprise me when I was in a too Ace Attourney way of thinking.\n\n-The game is woefully short.\nI completed my first playthrough in 5.6 hours according to steam. Even that time had few breaks where the game was left running. This is the greatest negative to the game. As a single case in later Ace Attourney games could easily last that amount of time by itself. Provided you take your time.\n\n-The ending was a bit....anti climactic.\nIn the 4th case I was in the B route. And it left me...Wanting more. Or a more epic conclusion.\n\nThese negatives dont outright ruin the game. But you should keep them in mind still. Nevertheless I enjoyed my time with JayJay and Sparrowson and I am looking forward to any possible continuation of their story. Or maybe another characters story inside the Aviary Attourney universe.","December 28, 2015","true","7.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Slightly amusing and considerate even though you get to present illegally obtained evidence. Not entirely sure if you can acquire it without illegal measures, but creative in a minor manner.

The jokes and puns are spot on and don't seem contrived. The dialogue fits each character well. Sparrowson is a riot and is the funny guy to Falcon's straght man and they compliment each other much like Sherlock Holmes and Watson do. Your choices have meaning though what meaning may not be readily apparent until the consequences are dropped on you. The court cases themselves are well done and reward you for paying attention and punishes you for blindly reaching.\n\nThe Art is exactly how it appears. The good thing is the characters are animated well, its not overdone but its not just static images so it makes the dialogue and art seem much more realistic. The visual effects following dramatic scenes are especially poignant. The fact that the characters are animals is not really commented on aside from puns but it helps give each character a unique appearance. There is a surprisingly large cast and each character including ones that get only one or two lines is lovingly drawn and animated.\n\nThe Sound direction is spot on as well. While the soundtrack is open sourced and public domain, they fit the associating characters so perfectly I have to give a personal shoutout to whoever took the time to match them up so nicely. Otherwise the sounds are actually quite miniaml and lends itself well to the art and storytelling.\n\nThere are a few odd bugs that aren't readily apparent but they have been speedy in their updates thus far.\n\n---\n\nBottom Line is this is a great game and for the surprisingly low price of $14.99 its a steal. I got it on sale but I feel as though had I paid full price I would still feel satisfied with the content I got for thr price. I wish I had backed their crowdfunding and will probably help fund their next game should they choose to make one. I don't usually give such high praise but this game managed to hit all the right notes for me. To give it a number I would say 9/10. 9.5/10 when the bugs are ironed out.

I don't know if it's just kids who are angry they're not getting what they want when they want it or people unfamiliar with the fact that this is totally normal procedure for indie VNs, but the straight-up abuse being hurled at the dev for daring to give a product to an audience is unthinkable. And yet for some reason the gamer community is seen as whiny and entitled. Wonder why.\n\nThis is an absolutely amazing and clever game, and one of the best VNs I've played since, well, Hatoful Pigeon. Frankly, I'm of the mind that bird parodies should become a thing in every genre. I've been trying to coerce everyone I know into playing it, and it is absolutely worth the price, even without the third route installed.

I bought it expecting it to be a humorous homage to the Phoenix Wright franchise, but I was happily mistaken: this game stands perfectly fine on its own two bird-feet.\n\nThe art and animation are clean and pleasant to look at, and not overly complicated, like a visual novel.  The writing was also nice, ranging from bad puns to interesting (if slightly heavy-handed, but I gave this a pass considering the time period) social commentary.  In fact, my only regret about this game is that there isn't more content, though it's implied that there's more coming soon!\n\nA quick note: Un-learn your Ace Attorney habits.  The game does not grind to a stop while you collect every bit of evidence you need, so if you're not careful you can end up going into a trial without important information or evidence.  Fortunately, the game is still forgiving, and you are able to go back and re-peat specific days to get whatever it was you forgot.

There's a push for greater realism in the court part of the game: while you can do the whole Phoenix Wright thing and find the real criminal and force him to confess in court, it's not always a requirement for a not guilty verdict. Simply demonstrating reasonable doubt IS sufficient.\n\nIt's also notable that the investigation sections have an action limit: going to a location to investigate it takes a day, and wasting time can mean the difference between mere acquittal and catching the real culprit -- or even outright failure -- since the trials are on fixed days that can't be moved.\n\nBut failure actually isn't the end in Aviary Attorney. The game has multiple possible endings, and failing cases can be necessary for some. In this way, the way you play the game determines not only the outcome, but also the tone of the game itself: idealistic play will result in an idealistic game, cynical play will result in a cynical game, and wacky Ace Attorney play can result in a wacky Ace Attorney game.\n\nI laughed, I cried, I got punched by a lion. 9/10, could use meatier trial sections but great game nonetheless.","February 7","true","6.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This game definitely pays homage to the Ace Attorney series, but it stands on its on two feet. The game is witty, amusing and generally gets you invested in the characters. The replay value of this game is big positive for me. The fact that you can start trail completely unprepared is not a bad thing.\n1. It's realistic that you can't have all the time in the world to comb all of Paris for clues before a trail date. So sometimes you miss some, so what? Live with it.\n2. It allows you to learn from your mistakes and replay the scenes if you want to or just continue the story.\n3. It allows for different outcomes throughout the game.\n\nThis game doesn't just stop and say, "Sorry you lost, try again?" It continues the story and lets you live with your mistakes. Too few games do that. I HIGHLY recommend this game to people who love the Ace Attorney games and to anyone who just likes a good story laced with humor and bad (good) puns.","February 8","true","18.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

While a lot compare this game to Phoenix Wright, I think the similarity ends with it being a lawyer game (there need to be more of these) where you interview people.\nI really loved the aspect of your choices making a difference as well.  In other lawyer games your choices usually end in a pass/fail state.  While this game your choices can cause different outcomes.  I like that.\nThe story was also beautiful.  I loved the characters I loved how they all had unique personas, even considering they were animals, I think it was brilliant.\nThe graphics while simple, were also beautiful.

The ways in which the different outcomes are achieved and the dialogue systems were well thought out. The storylines that were finished that is... sadly when you achieve one of the main story branches it states that the path is not yet finished and you have to step back a few days and try a different course of action. Not a good selling point for a supposedly non-early access game. That aside the game achieves what it sets out to do, create an Avian parody of Ace attorney. Mechanically the game works great. You travel around Paris in order to collect evidence and defend your client. There are several different locations you can travel to but traveling to most locations takes a whole day and you only have a certain amount of days before you must appear in court. This puts contraints on what you can do which makes matters seem more pressing. Avian Attorney really pushes you to actually investigate rather than blow money gambling on black jack (which is totally an option). the nice thing is if you missed a crucial piece of evidence you can always step back a day to get the ending you want. as I mentioned above the dialogue is also well written. There are so many different approaches you can take to obtain different forms of evidence or get past obstacles. will you bribe them or persuade them or just threaten to beat the ♥♥♥♥ out of them? the shear variety of choice within what is a relatively short storyline is the main draw for this game, well.. that and the glorious amount of Bird puns. all-in-all I give the game an 8/10 purely for being unfinished and me wanting even more of it! Although seemingly a simple novelty game at first sight Avian Attorney proves itself to be a fun and interesting ride for those who enjoy investigative games.  A tip though, if you find yourself stumped? just WING it. ha ha.. get it... Ill show myself out...","February 12","true","8.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The dialog is well written, but the story tends to thrash about, never fully developing plot points. The courtroom sections are absolutely awful. Not a single case reached the excitement of even the first case of any Phoenix Wright game. There are no twists, no challenges, and there isn't really anything to figure out. It just kind of... continues on... There are only 2 real cases in the game (The intro was far too short and simple to count), and surprisingly, the final case is by far the worst, most shallow and uninteresting mess ever. I can't even call it a case. You're literally lying the entire time and there is no outcome to the trial.\n\nIt's not that I was unhappy while playing this, but there were just way too many "Wow, really?

This is Gamer Guy (In a Suit) from the Echo Army YouTube channel! Today I am bringing you a review of Indie Mystery Visual-Novel, Aviary Attorney. Aviary Attorney was released on Steam on December 21, 2015 by Developer/Publisher Sketchy Logic.\n\n(NOTE: This game was NOT reviewed using a key provided by the Developer and/or Publisher, it was a game from my own account)\n\nVideo Review:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/FSbcrZv4Y_c\n\nThe "Too Long, Didn't Watch" Review:\n\nGreat fun, hilarious, beautiful. Top-Notch Visual Novel. 5/5 (despite the GLARINGLY obvious rush at release)\n\nThe "Meat & Potatoes" Review:\n\nThis game is simply gorgeous. That is probably the first thing you notice about Aviary Attorney overall. The music matches the art as well, simply beautiful. I have never played either Hatoful or Pheonix Wright, so most of the "comparisons" I am seeing do not mean much and felt like I could give a fresh perspective to this game. I was once studying to be an attorney (my "Clark Kent" still works Gov't) so felt immediately drawn to this. IT also happen to help that I absolutely LOVE horrible puns. If you do not, you may want to just walk away now. Not from the review, just from the game entirely. However, I find it absolutely hilarious. The dialogue and writing overall is superb, the art is beautiful, the piano is divine. This is everything a solid VN should be. The story is truly engaging and fun. An ending was unavailable at release, and release was delayed a few days. I attempted to get a hold of the reviewer for a key, and was unsuccessful. Clearly, they were overwhelmed in their attempts to meet their own deadline. I have seen complaints, but honestly they obviously cared enough to work EXTRA hard in the days up to, and since launch. That dedication to their product is a good thing. Does it suck that they missed their goal by a couple/few days? Sure. It seemed to be more out of a desire to release the best product they could and they continue to improve to this day (there have already been updates). Give this one a go. I fully endorse it and am loving every minute. Several LOL moments. Fans of any type of Visual Novel will enjoy this for sure, as will anyone with a good sense of humor. If action is what you want, you may not find it here. Tons of "Pros" and short on "Cons", this VN is truly worth the $15 pricetag. A true 5/5 for this gamer.\n\nHappy Gaming!","December 26, 2015","true","1.4"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

A court game lives or dies on its dialogue, and this dialogue is either boring or downright bad.   To add color, one of the suspects speaks in fake-Cockney, sprinkled with words like " 'ave" and "sayin' ".   However, he also says okie-dokie, a glaringly American term.   Although the drawings, the music, and the names are French, and the game is set in Paris, there's no French flavor at all to the dialogue, no French epithets or turns of phrase.  The two investigators you're guiding aren't well characterized -- the sidekick makes bad, not funny-bad, just bad, puns, and the lead investigator is solemn and rebukes the sidekick.   Finally, evidence searches are literal pixel-hunting: when the background is a cross-hatched engraving with lots of detail, it's almost impossible to guess which object is unusual and which is part of the original drawing.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/richardwong/recommended/384630/","richardwong","Richard Wong","http://steamcommunity.com/id/richardwong/","780 products in account","Aviary Attorney evokes fond memories of the "Ace Attorney" series. If you've never played them before, the general gist of it is that you're a lawyer defending a client, and to do so you investigate the scene of the crime, gather evidence and interrogate witnesses, and on court day use said evidence to attempt to get your client a "not guilty" verdict.\n\nSo compared to reality not really lawyer-like work at all, but as in this game you're playing as anthropomorphized bird Mssr. JayJay Falcon, you'll probably want to suspend your disbelief. Set in 1800s France, with old-timey art from J. J. Grandville to match, Aviary Attorney's presentation is simple but charming. The characters aren't voiced, but have different-toned blips to indicate who is speaking.\n\nGameplay-wise, Aviary Attorney is almost more of a visual novel. While you do travel from place to place to find clues and talk to people, there isn't as much interaction as you'd typically find in an adventure game. The puzzles are fairly simple, which may serve to annoy more hardcore adventure gamers. There is a bit of pixel hunting to be had (exacerbated slightly by the fact that everything is black-on-sepia), but it's nothing annoying.\n\nThe story and characters go on to steal the show, though. With a liberal sprinkling of puns and good humor, I felt that the characterizations of the animals you interact with were very well done. The atmosphere of the game also does not veer into the spiritual, which I always thought was a (albeit quirky) weakness of the Ace Attorney games.\n\nAll that said, the game felt like it went by pretty quickly. Since it's a sub-$20 buy, though, I think it's worth the money.","December 23, 2015","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Yes with a hint of maybe. All in all it will be best to wait to purchase this game until the developers release the debugged and complete version.\n\nAA is a fun playthrough for fans of both of the game's major inspirations (Phoenix Wright/Ace Attorney and Hatoful Boyfriend). It has its fair share of comedy and puns (although many of the puns will require minimal knowledge of the French language), and in the later half of the game, it has a great original overarching plot centering around the setting of pre-revolution France. The game also features a great original classical soundtrack and engaging graphics styled around 19th century etchings and caricatures.\n\nAt the moment, the game remains incomplete though, and this makes is a bit hard to recommend the game, especially with the high price point (for a short visual novel). The first half of the game will feel boring to Phoenix Wright players, as it nearly carbon copies the first Phoenix Wright game through the first two cases. Many bugs abound in the game that make it hard to understand why it was released (do not open the options menu from the title screen, and the save system is a mess). While the game boasts three endings, one of them is listed as "Coming Soon" and there is little knowledge as to whether this means pay-to-play DLC, a forthcoming update, or that it will ever come at all.\n\nShould the bugs be worked out and the game completed, it's well worth your time and money. If this ends up being the final version of the game, I still recommend it, but would urge players to wait and not pay more than $5 for the product presented.","December 27, 2015","true","8.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are some significant and insignificant bugs and typos at the time of this writing (December 27th, 2015), but the package as a whole is more than good enough for me to forgive some rough edges. (Pro tip: don’t adjust options at the title screen. Wait until you’re in the game proper. I had to uninstall and reinstall the game a few times until I figured out that was what was making it stop responding to me.)\n\nIt’s a visual novel about lawyers practicing in 19th Century France, except everyone is a creature from the illustrations of 19th Century satirist J. J. Grandville, set to music by the romantic era composer Camille Saint-Saëns.\n\nThe whole thing has a very Hatoful Boyfriend kind of feel to it, and not just because of the static images or the birds: this is a game that has a completely ridiculous premise and uses that to draw the player in to a grim tale of political strife, asking questions about justice and revenge. Parts of it seem to be direct responses to Ace Attorney scenes, too - a lot of Ace Attorney moments get flipped on their heads here.\n\nThat’s not to say it isn’t really funny when it wants to be - it’s freaking hilarious when it feels like it! That’s another thing that feels really Hatoful Boyfriend about the whole proceeding, but it’s certainly its own thing, and it got its talons in me really deep. Can’t wait for the third ending to get fixed!\n\ntl;dr: While there are some bugs still, it’s highly recommended for visual novel fans, especially if you enjoyed Hatoful Boyfriend and/or any of the Ace Attorney games.","December 27, 2015","true","15.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A bug?\n-The character animations are barely anything, and it's bare for even Ace Attorney standards of minimalism--would have liked to see more effort into some animations to spice up what ammounts to a text-heavy game.\n\nThe twist at the end of the first case is a strange move, in my opinion, but reserve judgment on it to see if it affects the whole game. If not, I don't like it very much. There's a lot to like with this game, but I think some bugs at launch will hurt it. While there are a lot of details in some aspects, I think there are some woefully plain aspects as well.\n\nI would recommend this game with some reservations, giving it a 6/10 thus far because of some bugs/design choices. In the absence of the above mentioned bugs, I would give this game, post-1st case, a 7/10.\n\nSimple fun, but appealing to only a very niche crowd.","December 22, 2015","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has great plot twists, a fine dosage of mystery and well, humour. Just like our well-known series Ace Attorney... In fact, I'd dare say it's exactly like Ace Attorney. Don't get me wrong but there's just too many similarities to let it pass, the only thing that makes these two games different are the cases and... well, everyone is an animal. This is not a bad thing if you plan to play it pretty much as a "Ace Attorney: Suddenly Everyone Is An Animal In the 19th Century!"\nAnd I only wish this was the only bad thing about this game...\nAt this point everyone should know that there are a lot of bugs in this game. Let's just start by saying that there's no definite "game over", if you get a bad ending you have to go back on the days. And that's okay if you didn't had to read everything again. Seriously, the story is really well-writen but reading it 3-4 times is seriously a pain in the ♥♥♥. It just turns into something really exhausting to have to skip things manually, to keep clicking on the screen over and over again.\nDespite all of these cons, I think that Aviary Attorney is still a great game, don't get me wrong, it delivers what it promised, and well, it's relatively cheap, so if you liked Ace Attorney you should give it a try.","December 24, 2015","true","9.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

After this, you explore locales related to the crime, collecting evidence and testimony. Once that's done, you go to the courtroom and try to outwit the prosecutor by cross-examining witness testimonies with evidence.\nWhat sets this apart from the Ace Attorney series has to be the way that decisions make the game play out. A poorly worded sentence or illegally acquired evidence can bar you from a useful piece of information for the trial. Does this change the course of the trial? I'm not entirely sure, even after the first case, I want to go in for another go to get those pieces of evidence I couldn't get before.\nThe game gives off a great atmosphere. The art is superb and very reminiscent of Victorian-style ink drawings. Character portraits will move around the screen in conjunction with actual movement, which on paper sounds small, but in a visual novel-style game it helps to immerse you in what the characters are doing.\nThe writing is superb. There are some laugh-out-loud funny moments in here, which is an achievement in itself.\nTo be honest, I bought this game on a whim, being a bit of an avian fanatic. But I was not disappointed in what I got from this, and I have yet to play the full game, even.\n\nEDIT:\nI guess if there were one thing to comment on right now, the game doesn't seem to be 100% finished at this time. I was playing through part three and got to a certain point, and I'm guessing it's just the path that I was sent through based on my actions, but after I hit a certain point I was given a screen telling me to check back in a couple of days after an update or to go back and try to go for a different ending. Hopefully it gets up soon, I was really curious as to how my ending would go.","December 22, 2015","true","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can definitely feel the love and effort that was given to these areas of the game and I loved it. It truly felt refreshing.\n\nThe story however is short and, in my opinion, a little lacking. All of the cases are quick and have rather simple scenerios. Especially Case 4, where investigation is streamlined and we are given short and simple endings. Case 3 probably took the longest but only because you have to go through it fully twice to get both the endings.\n\nNow, at it's modest price tag of 15$ (compared to Ace Attorney's 35$ on release) you get a comperable amount of time for your dollar. However, don't be expecting long/intricate cases or a thrilling plot. But do prepare to chuckle whenever Sparrowson speaks.\n","January 7","true","9.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

FOR JUSTICE!\n\nThe facts are these:\n#1: The writing is charming, witty, and quite punny (and there are a few jokes for those who speak French)\n#2: The art style is boldly different, yet somehow nothing is lacking in the visuals. The details are beautiful and every new character/animal has a completely fresh design that is great to see.\n#3: The story itself is extremely interesting. Each case warms you up to the over-arching narrative that takes some detective-work on the player's part to piece together. Will all these facts collide in the developing Chapter 5? I hope so.\n#4: While hilarious, the story also takes itself quite seriously. One wrong move on the player's part could result in a death, not just a "game over." In this spirit, the story is grounded in the very real setting of revolutionary France, allowing the history buffs a bit of a spree through tumultous times.\n#5: The so-called "negative" reviews of this game are actually worth a read, because most praise the game in the highest fashion. Some bird-brains just can't wait 5 days for one of 3 intricate endings to be polished and delivered. A miscommunication, at best. Having played all three endings (the delayed ending cannonically last, in my case), I would say it was well worth the short wait.\n\nThe Verdict:\nGUILTY of being a wonderful romp through mystery, art, wit, and great characters. This game is worth a play (or three), and I take off my hat to the developers. I, for one, am happily looking forward to the promise of even more in the future. Due process and all that.\n\nReview ADJOURNED.","January 7","true","7.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Fantastic visual and audio presentation and very good writing striking a good balance of the dramatic and comedic. My only complaint is the exploration feels a bit rigid at times, not allowing you to push your luck as much in conversation choices as similar games, to explore every interaction. At worst it can require you to essentially fail some of the later acts on the first try without prior knowedge of the correct lead and therefore meeting the schedule of the case. It makes up for this somewhat it making it very easy to travel back to any day of the act you choose without a lot of manual savepoint nonsense, but for me this somewhat degrades the intensity of the aha moments or to make correct choices as the cost for the benefit of allowing you a lot of freedom of changing the course of investagations.\nOverall, if one is a fan of adventure games, other mystery/investagative/attoney games, or visual novels, I think this would be an enjoyable fit.","January 12","true","9.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Mind that I do rarely wright reviews (pun intended) and I really really want to see a sequel of this game.\n\nThat said, this game exceeded my expectations in many, many ways. I was at first quite happy to buy an Ace Attorney clone and to my uttermost surprise right on the second case this game seemed like it would fit on the "pupil surpasses master" category. I was correct.\n\nWhy should you buy it:\n\nIt's not only really well written and crafted, It feels way more dangerous than Ace Attorney. You see, the trials have dates, and you better get the job done of asking the right questions and collecting the correct evidence before the trial day otherwhise you will go to court without the necessary assets to win the case . If you do a poor job at investigation phase, you will fail...\n...and that's the best part. Failing doesn't mean you will get a "game over" screen. There is a special case that might go in threee different paths depending on your performance and decisions.\n\nIt's a delightful twist to the Ace series, while it doesn't have a Bioware/Telltale range of storyline paths, it doesen't feels like you're been railed visual-novel style. The text is clever, the smart and non-lazy use of Creative Commons art works marvelously, the plot twists are quite twisty indeed and if you think this game is full of puns, well, you're wright (strike two).\nYou'll more than once think "well, that escalated quickly".\n\nAnd to end the "why should you buy this" rant: it's amazing how a pun-riddled game about antropomorphic animals performing mundane tasks can be quite a banquet for though.\n\nAnd don't worry about the  CONS, for they're few :\n- A little glitchy here and there, I particularly had a lot of trouble with sound and had to lower my sound config in order to have it working properly.\n- The interface is quite pretty looking but messy and non-intuitive sometimes. Examples: 1: there is a blackjack mini-game that would benefit a lot from a "Replay" button without the need to go through dialogue again in order to play it. 2 : The main map of the game is quite messy, sometimes it tries to prompt you with a special cinematic and the prompt has exactly the same color of the background so is quite easy to miss. Besides, it does not tell you the day the trial will occur, nor allows you to check your evidence and suspects folder.\n\n\nBuy this game wright now and you wont regret it (strike 3.

However, the setting (and unique art style) in  Aviary Attorney is so different that it stands on it's own as a very solid and enjoyable experience.\n\nCountless times, during my playthrough, I  literally was  laughing out loud.  The dialogue between characters is hilarious, even though the setting is in the 1800's the developers definately made things very relatable.

This is not  a very long game but the writing is on point, the references range from Phoenix Wright which this game draws heavily from to many quite intellectual references.\n\nThe game has 3 different endings and each will help to build the full picture about each character. Each case also tends to have at least one unexpected turn of events to keep you on your toes.\n\nThe music and art are both fantastic each character looks stunning and the animation is simple and not too distracting and well thought out. The polish is simply fantastic.\n\nThis is shaping up to be a fantastic game that will be familiar to fans of Phoenix Wright but is certainly distinct enough in game play and in character.\n\nSo to sumarise this game delivers on plot and characters and is a joy to play however it is rather short. To compare it to Phoenix Wright it is about half the price and only about a 1/3 of the length. There is one more case to come in the far future as a bonus (it was a kickstarter stretch goal). I would recommend picking it up but it may be wise to wait for it to go on sale.","December 22, 2015","true","13.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

By no means does it invent the wheel in a new way, but it's refreshing nonetheless.\n\nIf there's one flaw, then that at the end you're probably gonna be craving more. The puzzles and trials are not incredibly complex or difficult, especially if you're familiar with the Ace Attorney games, so there's a big chance that you'll find the game lacking a bit on the challenge departement.\n\nAlso, bird puns.

You take on the role of JayJay Falcon, Paris' finest bird defence lawyer as he investigates crimes, interviews witnesses, assembles cases and proves his clients innocence. Fans of the Ace Attorney games will be right at home with the gameplay, but be warned if you fail a case you carry on regardless, albeit in a more morose mood than before. Time waits for no man, and neither does Aviary Attorney, if you failed to pick up the crucial piece of evidence then you will be punished for it later. The story changes depending on your actions, a refreshing change from chronically linear games that inspired it.\n\n\nThe aesthetics of the game are a lovingly curated experience, the character art is from J.J. Grandville’s “The Public and Private Life of Animals”, the backgrounds and objects are from other period books, and even the font is old! The attention to detail is staggering, not a single piece looks out of place. Combine this with a lovely soundtrack comprised of music by romantic-era composer Camille Saint-Saëns and you have a gorgeous game straight out of 1840’s Paris.\n\n\nHilarious to a fault when it wants to be and surprisingly dark when it needs to, you are playing a tense, pre-revolution Paris after all. If you need more courtroom style games in your life, this is certainly a good place to start.","January 12","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/richardwong/recommended/384630/","richardwong","Richard Wong","http://steamcommunity.com/id/richardwong/","780 products in account","Aviary Attorney evokes fond memories of the "Ace Attorney" series. If you've never played them before, the general gist of it is that you're a lawyer defending a client, and to do so you investigate the scene of the crime, gather evidence and interrogate witnesses, and on court day use said evidence to attempt to get your client a "not guilty" verdict.\n\nSo compared to reality not really lawyer-like work at all, but as in this game you're playing as anthropomorphized bird Mssr. JayJay Falcon, you'll probably want to suspend your disbelief. Set in 1800s France, with old-timey art from J. J. Grandville to match, Aviary Attorney's presentation is simple but charming. The characters aren't voiced, but have different-toned blips to indicate who is speaking.\n\nGameplay-wise, Aviary Attorney is almost more of a visual novel. While you do travel from place to place to find clues and talk to people, there isn't as much interaction as you'd typically find in an adventure game. The puzzles are fairly simple, which may serve to annoy more hardcore adventure gamers. There is a bit of pixel hunting to be had (exacerbated slightly by the fact that everything is black-on-sepia), but it's nothing annoying.\n\nThe story and characters go on to steal the show, though. With a liberal sprinkling of puns and good humor, I felt that the characterizations of the animals you interact with were very well done. The atmosphere of the game also does not veer into the spiritual, which I always thought was a (albeit quirky) weakness of the Ace Attorney games.\n\nAll that said, the game felt like it went by pretty quickly. Since it's a sub-$20 buy, though, I think it's worth the money.","December 23, 2015","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Still, maybe six hours isn't enough for $15... but if that's not an issue for you (or maybe you're just slower with this sort of game than I am) then honestly I can't think of another good reason to not buy it.
