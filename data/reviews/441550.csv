A word of warning; many of the negative reviews here (rightfully) deal with issues regarding graphics and loading the game, which can be resolved with a bit of tweaking.\n\nI played this game to death as a kid, even though a lot of my success in it was the result of endless hours of trial and error; the learning curve is perhaps the steepest in video game history, there's no tutorial, and everything that's thrown at you can be overwhelming even for people who are familiar with grand strategy titles (a PDF scan of the old instruction booklet can be found in the folders, though). Likewise, while the graphics might have been cutting-edge in 1998, they're... lackluster nowadays.\n\nBut don't let either of those disuade you; Rebellion is one of the greatest strategy games ever made, and could easily give most games nowadays a run for their money. You can play as either the Rebellion or Empire with the ultimate goal of defeating the other faction and liberating/dominating the (size adjustable) galaxy.\n\nAt your disposal to accomplish this monumental and occasionally grindy goal will be a near-endless array of space ships that you can command in glorius 32-bit space combat (the spiritual successor to this game; Empire at War, would refine this aspect greatly), dozens of characters from the period ranging from everyone between Luke Skywalker to Thrawn, agents who you can send on missions to subvert the enemy or strengthen yourself, and as many armies, shield generators and Death Stars as your infastructure and technology can support. And as everything takes place in real time, you will rarely find youself without something to do if you play proactively - and the AI won't sit back on its laurels, either.\n\nIn addition to everything else this game has to offer in terms of gameplay and replayability, the game also comes complete with an encyclopedia that gives a treasure trove of information about all the units, ships, planets and characters that appear in game, all drawn from the across the entire extended universe lore available at the time. So if you also want to explore the old Star Wars EU, or just dislike Disney's, this is also the game for you.\n\nYou can also train Chewbacca as a Jedi if the game smiles on you, so there's that.\n\nRebellion is well worth the $6 and initial headache, and can be immensly fun, immersive and addicting if you have the patience to learn its ins and outs, and I highly recommend it for any fan of Star Wars or grand strategy.","March 2","true","108.3"," 64 of 75 people (85%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","85","64","75","3","5"

Early game, both sides sieze planets; mid game, build defence and offence; end game, assult the planets one by one.  And yet, there is something very satisfying about crushing the rebel scum once and for all.\n\nHave had some graphical errors.

It is one of my favorite Star Wars titles.\n\nThat being said, avoid this version. On my Windows 10 PC at least, it is buggy as hell. Playing the game Full Screen washes out the colors and flips all the icons upside down. Playing the game in a Window fixes that problem but now you have a 640x480 unscalable window to play the game in... When the game starts it is impossible to skip the droids 20 minute speech without deleting the .dll files for them. Also, perhaps most importantly, the drop down menus for the constructon buildings doesn't seem to work. I click the drop down and nothing happens. So for me, the game isn't even playable.\n\nI will stick to my Windows 98 VM and SWR disk when I want to play this I guess...\n\nSteam shouldn't allow broken titles like this to be sold here.\n\nUPDATE: I was able to figure out how to get the drop down menus to work... you have to play with the game in a little window in the top left corner of the screen. But then I "discovered" a new "feature" of this game.

It was Rebellion, I still have the original box, but the old disc and newer operating systems wouldn't allow me to reinstall it and play it properly.\n\nNow this version turns out to work flawlessly. I'm running the game on Windows 7 64-bit and it even passed the utmost test of all with flying colors... Alt tabbing. The game shows its age with all the pixelated cinematics due to the poor encoding of the time, but it also runs on my 1080p monitor with a 480p quality without compromising gameplay. I believe this is the same build used by Good Old Games with just a few tweaks to make sure it wouldn't fail.\n\nThis is particularly great for me because at the time my English wasn't nearly as good as it is now, so I finally understood the garrison requirements to avoid uprisings. I'm also glad to know that I got most of the rules at that time and the nostalgia is fitting. People hardly get to live the glory of certain games after a given amount of time has passed, but it seems to me that Star Wars Rebellion was meant to be a great game no matter how old. Coolhand managed to fit so much of the expanded universe lore in there that I was able to picture the faces of many cherished characters I hadn't even read about by then.\n\nYou should definitely give it a try if you're ok with a 32-bit color game featuring some of the most repetitive advisors on the history of gaming.\n\nedit: I forgot to mention that this version does not include multiplayer at the moment. Also, it doesnt support steam overlay so there's no way to upload screenshots at the moment.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDeseja ver mais resenhas como esta?

Launch the game, and leave it in the top left corner and do NOT move it (moving it causing the production glitch bug).

I played this a lot eighteen years ago when I had the original CD-ROM with the hefty, well written manual (anybody remember the cool reference poster?). I am so glad that it is available on Steam and I am so glad that the problems that other reviewers reported earlier with upside down icons have apparently been resolved. This game works perfectly (well, I have had two crashes in 16 hours of gameplay, but saving regularly is quick and easy) and I got it for just a few bucks. I am also glad the game comes with a PDF of the original manual, but I wish it was a higher quality scan. Oh well!\n\nI am having so much fun playing it again after all of these years and it's just as good. They only thing I will say negative about the game is that it has a really terrible interface. There are menus, sub-menus, scrollable lists, and tabs galore. There's lots of scrolling and hunting around for things, as well as lots of clicking to initiate things you want to do in the game; sending Han Solo and Chewbacca on an abduction mission, aided by a team of rebel infiltrators, to capture Darth Vader on Sullust, for example. The depth of this game and all of the many things you can do can really make it hard to keep track of all that you've got going on around the galaxy. At least the game provides a search tool that lets you find specific planets, personnel, or fleets pretty quickly.\n\nSeriously, if you love Star Wars and strategy on a grand scale, you owe it to yourself to try this oldie-but-goodie. I can't wait to try out playing against someone head-to-head, something I never did way back when.","May 4","true","53.2"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

No other Star Wars game has the level of depth and strategy as this. You have all the forces of the Empire or the Rebellion at your command, and it's up to you to lead them to victory. As its leader, it behooves you to strengthen your faction's military, industrial base, political support, and information networks in order to keep the war machine at full capacity. Few other games will make you feel like a master strategist as Star Wars: Rebellion.\n\nPros:\n+ Broad-scale strategic gameplay that ranges across the entire galaxy\n+ Deep mechanics for building, managing, and conquering your faction\n+ Control famous characters like Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Princess Leia, Darth Vader, and Emperor Palpatine\n+ Command space battles with iconic Star Wars ships like Star Destroyers, TIE Fighters, X-Wings, and even Death Stars\n+ A who's-who look into the Expanded Universe pre-Prequel Trilogy ; almost every unit, hero, planet, and building comes  from the EU\n\nCons:\n- UI is a bit outdated - it's a very menu-based game with little in the way of keyboard shortcuts or other modern concessions\n- Some of the mechanics aren't explained well in-game, meaning you will have to consult resources outside the game to understand how everything works\n- Tactical depth of battles are lower than you might expect - space conflicts play out a bit slowly with a strange UI, while land battles happen completely behind the scenes without player input after the battle begins\n- Little optimization for modern hardware - you may need to do some work to get it to run on your machine.

I've probably clocked more hours on this game (even before it came out on Steam) than any other game I've owned. Back when it was released in the 90s this game was possible a key factor in my doing less than amazingly in school.\n\nThe update/port to Windows 10 works plays just as it did back when. The graphics are dated, the space combat limited, but damn it I still enjoy it now.\n\nWhy is this a 'no' then?\n\nThe game crashes. A lot. It crashes roughly once every 2-3 hours for me. That may not sound like a lot, but this is a game without auto-save. A lot can happen in 2-3 hours, and a lot that you basically need to redo. Every time the game crashes I feel like giving up because unlike starting a game afresh, it's incredibly boring to execute the same strategies to take the same planets to have the same outcomes again. It's one thing not knowing what's going to happen. It's completely another having to relive the same 300 days all over again.\n\nSo... great game. But what a frustrating port.\nI'm not sure if I'm going to play this again. Was it worth the few dollars I paid? For the nostalgia, sure. But has it possibly ruined the memory of this game forever?

It has become a point of pride that the homeworld of those nasty, furry little c**k smokers must be wiped out as soon as possible - b*llocks to the diplomatic consequences, the Flea-woks must die.\nOn a slightly more serious note, the units are quite well balanced, the Death Star may seem powerful, but they are expensive and take an age to build, the rest of the ship classes are pretty comparable, with the Empire having a slightly edge in military capability. Where the Rebels excell is in diplomacy, when combined on missions to convert neutral worlds, Alliance diplomats are extremely proficient and can expand your resource potential very quickly in the early stages of the game.\nTo putit simply, the Alliance definately has the edge in the early stages of the game, with the Empires' strengths coming to the fore in the latter stages of the game.\n\nI could drone on for ever aboot the best tactics to emply, but the beauty of this game is it gives you the freedom to try many different things, you can even have Luke Skywalker assassinated - so much fun  :)\n\nThe interface is a little clunky now, but once you get used to it, it's pretty simple, if a little crude by todays standards.\ntbh, the space battles are sh*te, but can't really be skipped as the simulated result doobry can't be relied upon to give u the best results, even if the odds are in you favour.\n\nIn summary:\nTotally free strategy + nerd-fest levels of technical accuracy + having Chewbacca whacked + Death Stars + destroying Endor = very much woth the cost of a couple of pints of beer.","March 3","true","13.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","3","3","3","0"

Get it while you can in the Humble Star Wars Bundle 2. Admittedly, though, it is one of those games you will either love or hate. It is basically a grand, realtime 4X strategy game set after the destruction of the first death star. You have the whole galaxy and all the powers of either the Rebellion or Empire at your fingertips. It is a blast managing your agents (there are dozens and dozens of named major and minor characters for each faction) and sending them on missions, deploying fleets and armies, managing production, exploring new worlds, balancing diplomacy, research the list goes on. The interface is a bit archaic, but once you get the hang of it, it really is easy and makes a lot of sense, unfortunately, the real time 3D space battles never had good graphics even when the game came out, still they are satisfying and were way ahead of their time.\n\nThe game features tons of Stars Wars lore nods, including expanded universe legends content and characters. The game is relatively slow paced (compared to other SW RTS like Empire at War), but really focuses on large scale strategy and learning the various intricate systems (economics, military, diplomacy, production, espionage, research, etc). So, if you want to try this game, be ready to learn (I recommend reading the manual or a quick guide on the internet before jumping in). If the game has some weak points, they are largely the failures of the AI (which is nonetheless fun to play against, but can be easily exploited if you discover its weaknesses), and a few minor stupid rules that you can fairly easily avoid (such as sending a character on a mission that fails will send them retreating back to their point of origin and not to the nearest friendly system).\n\nMy favorite part of the game definitely has to be how all the systems interact and how interesting situations emerge regularly. Bombarding a system here might hamper diplomatic relations in the sector if your ♥♥♥♥♥ admiral causes some collateral damage, maybe even causing an uprising on a garrisoned world. Perhaps your stormtroopers capture a rebel spy who provides the location of Leia Organa on a diplomatic mission to a neutral world, time to send Darth Vader and a few cronies to capture her, or send out the Star Destroyers and hope to catch her in the net of a blockade? Imperial probe droid locates the hidden rebel base in the outer rim, time to evacuate it in fear of an Imperial task force to follow, or stand and fight? Form a plot to kidnap the Emporeror? Don't care about capturing a planet but want to deny your enemy use of it, time for a base delta zero (or maybe send your newly armed and operational Death Star)? Luke Skywalker finds one of your characters to be force sensitive, time to send them to a secluded world for Jedi training? The staggering amount of emergentant possibilities are just awesome in this game.\n\nOverall, like I said, this is either a game you will love or hate. If it sounds enticing, give it a try, I think you'll be glad you did. If dealing with an archaic interface and learning some intricate systems that will require reading a manual sounds like a slog, just run the other way.","March 3","true","0.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It is dated and lacking in some respects - especially the way research works - but it is a hugely addictive grand strategy game, especially so for Star Wars fans.\n\nTaking place just after the events of Episode IV, you command either the Rebel Alliance or Galactic Empire, seeking to defeat the opposing faction (yes, this does mean you get to tell characters such as Emperor Palpatine, Han Solo, and Darth Vader exactly what to do, as well as a host of more minor characters, such as Admiral Ackbar). Through diplomacy and military efforts you have to sway neutral planets to your cause, as well as taking them from the enemy, and exploring the outer edges of the galaxy. There's a few differences between how each side plays, with their own strengths and weaknesses, but the basics are very similar.\n\nIt's disappointing though that there aren't a few more modern updates, such as Steam overlay or a nice easy way to play in Windowed mode (if there is one, please let me know!), but I'm yet to run in to any of the problems people reported on the GOG version. But, the sheer joy of being able to play this game again after so many years without any problems more than makes up for that. There's not much else like commanding a Death Star as you go around destroying half the known planets in the galaxy.","March 2","true","15.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Despite that, I still don't recommend the game because of Steam's bad management and communication. [/edit]\n\nI've been playing this on gog.com for a while now and got the Steam version through Humble Bundle.\n\nTL;DR: Excellent game, Steam sucks.\n\nRebellion is one of my favorite Grand Strategy games back then, still worth playing. I must have sunk hundreds of hours in the last 18 years into this game and it still rocks the shack. Having full control over planets you try to gather enough resources to build up a mighty fleet whilst sending characters thoughout the galaxy on various missions. A no-brainer, despite the outdated graphics and somewhat bulky interface.\n\nWhat sucks is, again, the way Steam handles these old games. First of all, 6 Euros is a lot of money for a game that's almost 20 years old. But when I do pay this amount, I'd expect more overhaul than what actually is provided. Yes, I'm thinking of a convinient multiplayer support, and not of ♥♥♥♥ing around with TCP/IP protocols and stuff. I couldn't connect to a game at all (leave me a comment if you managed it and I will edit this review). This sucks hard. The Steam overlay just won't work either - again.

Back in the day, I played a lot of strategy games, and I did pretty well at most of them. I was in the top 50 at StarCraft in the late 90s, top 5 at Red Alert 2, #1 at Empire at War, and I took the top 10 spots in other games. Needless to say, I'm a strategy gaming fanatic. I was even interviewed by GameSpy at one point. Yet, this is the game I ALWAYS go back to playing, even after so many years. I prefer this game over StarCraft and other games. It is THAT GOOD. The multiplayer is absolutely phenomenal and incredibly addictive. Every game is unique and different. You get different starting conditions each time and you really have to be smart about how you use your personnel, facilities, and ships. There are so many strategies and counter strategies.\n\nIn multiplayer, the game is played at variable speeds, it automatically adjusts to the slowest player. If one of the players selects the medium pace, and the other player selects the fast pace, the game is played at the medium pace. You can change the speed of the game while you play, so you're not locked in at one particular speed for the entire game.\n\nMultiplayer is where this game shines. It has the best multiplayer out of any other strategy game I've ever played. It's so incredibly interesting, especially once you understand the mechanics of the game and how everything works. If you've never played this game before, or if it has been a while, definitely get this game. Then, get online and start playing some multiplayer games. Currently, the most popular way to play this game online is via Game Ranger or Direct IP.","March 2","true","37.3"," 1 person found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","0","1","1","2","0"

Its not a game one can play a few casual hours in, but one could definitely find themselves saying "Another hour then I'll do something else..." only to find a day has passed realtime.\nThere's a lot of resource management and strengths/weaknesses to each system/world owned. Its a case of complexity vs. depth, whereas some parts of the game are deep and others just overly complex. I could write a review on the mechanics alone but that would be an essay rather than a snapshot review, suffice to say there's a lot going on here and not all of it is great.\nMy recommendation is, if you can get past the Windows 95 era graphics, you have a solid strategy/galactic management Star Wars game. Empire at War seems to have taken *some* notes from this game, and the similarities can be seen after a few hours of play (especially if one uses the Thrawn's Revenge mod for EaW).\nSo 7.5/10 is the numbered score I'll rate it, very replayable but heavy on complexity. Not really for casual players due to the number of hours one would have to sink into the game per playthrough.\nMy previous review was salty towards Steam for carrying it while it was in a poor working condition for most modern systems, the patch has changed that and so I decided to "patch" my review in accordance. Still I believe games should never be released for sale unless they're in good working order, that stance will never change.","March 1","true","0.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","34"

TBH it looked bad new on the cd back in the late 90's. But the concepts and the Grand strategy of this game is what makes it what it is.\n\nGet the Mods to better the models and some basic game balancing so it looks a bit more like 2002 graphics...\n","May 8","true","40.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is complex and has a pretty interesting space combat simulator. Can feel kind of slow if you don't use your imagination or expect a typical RTS or Space Fleet Sim. Empire at War is probably better as a combat RTS but this game shines as it allows you to retell the whole story of Star Wars.","May 10","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
