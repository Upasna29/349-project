The cute characters were enough to get me interested, but the enjoyable game play and well-rounded experience kept me hooked.\n\nGame play is pretty standard genre fair; each level gives you a set of objectives, usually in the area of collecting so many items and creating a set number of food dishes.  You're only given so much time and money to purchase livestock and tend to your land, so figuring out a strategy on what to buy and sell while keeping critters out of the barnyard and picking up produce before it disappears is the gist of things.  That's not to say it can't get hectic, especially if you're trying for gold trophies, but it's definitely one of the more casual and laid back time management games I've played in a while.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=474816058\nWhat I enjoyed most is the number of features the game offers.  Completing gold gives coins that you can use on a slot machine which awards more gold coins, stars (in-game currency) and power-ups useable in the game levels.  The power-ups are pretty awesome and have often helped me squeeze out a gold when I've struggled a bit.   As you complete levels, you'll earn stars that can be used to upgrade your farm equipment which will then churn out more product or give more storage space.  You can also level up your trusty companions to better help fend off pesky intruders, and even buy coins to use on the slot machine.  So if you end up with an overabundance of currency after purchasing all of your upgrades, it's still actually useful.\n\nAll of the artwork has a cute, cartoony aesthetic to it that compliments the casual game play elements quite well.  The silly dialogue between the farm animals is also humorous, and the overall feel of the game is just...fun.  The whole package taken together is a well-rounded experience, especially compared to many other casual titles that don't feel nearly as polished.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=474816015\nThe only aspect I felt was lacking is the absence of Steam integration for the achievements.  There is good reason to pursue them otherwise, however, as they award coins to be used in the slot machines.  Even so, there is no excuse for a lack of full integration.  So I beg of you Alawar, give us Steam Achievements!\n\nHurricane Season is a great casual title, especially if you're looking for lighter fair to relax with in-between more serious gaming sessions. If you're new to time management games, this is an excellent title to start off with.  Of all the games in the genre I've played, it's definitely the most polished and easiest to get into.  With all of the extra features, there's plenty to keep you entertained, whether it's for 5 minutes or 5 hours.\n\nBottom Line:   Recommended for those looking for a relaxing casual title with lots of polish and character.\n\nNote - This game was provided by the publisher with the request to write an informative review.  No other consideration, compensation or instruction was received.","July 3, 2015","true","6.4"," 83 of 94 people (88%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","88","83","94","4","6"

The core mechanics of the game remained mostly the same as previous Farm Frenzy games. Keep your animals well fed, process your products, and get paid, while trying to fend off intruders such as bears and ferrets.\n\nPerforming well in Farm Frenzy: Hurricane Season will reward you with extra cash as well as a token, which then can be used in the slot machine for a variety of different bonuses. This is a welcome addition to the series as it provides an actual incentive to going after the gold medals and an extra degree of replayability.\n\nThe game falls short at the audio department, unfortunately, since you’ll be listening to the same, short country music on a loop, the soundtrack itself isn’t bad, but it does get pretty repetitive after a while.\n\nIn conclusion, Farm Frenzy: Hurricane Season is a reasonably executed time management game and a worthy sequel to the series. It promises to keep the diehard fans happy with its timeless and cheerful art style and generous amount of content.\n","July 3, 2015","true","7.0"," 59 of 86 people (69%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","69","59","86","14","0"

For the unitiated, the series involves multitasking your way through a series of goals in a cute little farm setting. From keeping food growing for flocks of chickens, to harvesting eggs, to processing farm products using various machinery you build each level, and selling your finished goods for cash, this game might sound adorable and casual but it definitely gets challenging trying to beat the gold level time as you play.\n\nFarm Frenzy Hurricane Season follows the formula of the earlier titles in the series, with more colorful graphics and a little storyline of sorts where the player is tasked with rebuilding the farm after a hurricane has struck.\n\nI've been playing the Farm Frenzy series on my tablet for years and it's nice to see them on Steam for people who prefer to keep their gaming on one platform, who don't have access to games on mobile devices, or just enjoy playing their games on larger screens. It's an especially great game for children, as it's easy to learn the basics and the graphics and music are really cute, but it's definitely challenging enough to keep adults interested.\n\nI really wish that the 15 in-game achievements were also Steam achievements.  I think that would add value to the title, especially for achievement hunters.\n\nNote: A copy of this game was provided for review purposes.","July 3, 2015","true","6.4"," 31 of 39 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","31","39","2","1"

Basic Flash Style Bears, Chickens, cats, cages and backdrops fill every\nscreen.  Every animal is delightfully animated as it romps across the farm land.. I Would\nhave liked to see a little more variety in backdrops.  6/10\n\nSound\n\nThe music in Farm Frenzy is in a country funk rockabilly type style.  There are multiple\ntracks so you do not get tired of the same old one as quickly.  As quickly meaning that\nafter a few levels, I was forced to mute the music.  The sound effects are fitting and work\nwell with the atmosphere of the game.  5/10\n\nGameplay\n\nSo the story is, a hurricane has wiped out your farm and its up to you to rebuild it.  This is done by completing certain tasks, such as “have your chickens lay 5 eggs”.  It is all done through an easy to pick up "point and click" interface.    As you move along in progression different buildings and animals are required to complete the tasks given.  You earn money to unlock these buildings in between missions.  You also unlock other helpful farm animals, such as a dog, and other critters.   There is also a Slot machine that\n\nyou earn spins with, but I never won anything.   7/10\n\nOverall opinion\n\nI go into each review with the audience that the game is designed for in mind.  With that\nsaid, I would say this game is great.  Each level acts a tutorial, for the next levels\ncoming up.  Also there are stickers to collect in game.  A delightful time waster for all\nages, easy to pick up and play.

The game bears the Buka trademark cute childrens story book graphics.  As is characteristic of nearly all games from this publisher the game is family friendly and well suited for younger children, but will appeal to casual game fans of all ages.\n\nThe graphics are full HD and are both cute and well animated.  The artstyle is colourful and pleasing to look at.\n\nThe sound is contextual with pleasant samples.  Music is sequenced sound loops in a pseudo country style arangement which is pleasing to listen to.  There appears to be a single in-game track repeated during game play stages which gets a bit repetitive.  The repetition is broken to an extent by different tracks for the menu and pre-game instructions.\n\nThe player is tasked with purchasing chickens, collecting eggs, processing the eggs to make powder eggs, processing the powder eggs to make pasta and also accumulating funds.  Storage facilities can be upgraded as can manufacturing facilities.  Cats and dogs can be hired to help capture ferrets and bears which can be sold at the market.  As storage becomes full goods need to be transported to the market for sale.\n\nThe style of play is arcade action with puzzle solving and resource management aspects.  There are rewards for completing level completion criteria within certain time constraints.\n\nThe game is fun to play and it can be quite challenging completing stages within the required time.\n\nThe game size is small which should be a relief to those with limited storage capacity on their compter or laptop.\n\nTo summarise, a fun family friendly game with really cute graphics and good re-play value for those who like casual games.\n\n7.8 / 10","July 4, 2015","true","9.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It's a nice and casual game to play when you want to relax and kill time. But just because it's casual doesn't make it easy, there is a level of challenge to it if you want to get the gold ranking on the levels.\n\nI've played the previous game in this series and this one is more of the same game play wise. More game play elements were added, like collecting stickers and the slot machine as well as new machines to buy so it is an improvement. Another noticeable improvement is the artwork. In this game the animals, the levels and everything has been made cuter and more colorful which I find highly visually appealing.\n\nThe game does have a story, you're pretty much this awesome farmer task to save the island! The animals all talk and have perky personalities which is very amusing. The story isn't the highlight of the game but I do like the talking animals that pop up.\n\nOverall it's a solid game if you enjoy casual games.
